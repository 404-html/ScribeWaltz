00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,960
This is Jocko podcast number
one 63 that Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,750
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,640
I am bleeding out.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,660
Okay.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,660
I can feel my life ebbing away as blood
seeps from my body into the Iraqi soil.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,800
A few brown weeds splashed.

7
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:30,180
Crimson now are crushed around me as I
lay sprawled on my back in the middle of

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:35,040
this ambush.
The weeds offer no concealment.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,840
I'm in the open alone and wounded

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,750
sizzles of pain hit me in waves
like pulses of electricity.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,770
A bullet has torn off my left arm.

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,750
Okay.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,590
After I get hit,
I reach over to grab my left hand.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,690
Okay.

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,830
It isn't there.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,220
Yeah.

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,610
I hunt around feeling only the gear
on the far left side of my body.

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,490
No arm. I tried to move the
fingers on my left hand,

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,060
but my mind sends signals to
a station that doesn't exist.

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,430
Now I can't feel anything but pain.

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,453
Yeah.

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,250
Bullets kicked dirt in my face
through my night vision goggles.

23
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,820
I see green blooms of light
strobing the darkness.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Muzzle flashes from automatic weapons 10
meters away and enemy machine gun opens

25
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,090
fire again.
It is a belt fed,

26
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:41,480
Russian made crew served weapon,
probably a PKM.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,700
They sound like giant zippers tearing
open when the gunners go cyclic,

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,050
like now

29
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,640
the air around me or rubs
with sharp cracks. The
miniature sonic booms of seven,

30
00:01:55,641 --> 00:02:00,020
six, two millimeter bullets speeding
past me a 2,500 feet per second.

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,580
The terrorist gunner lowers his aim.

32
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,130
Yeah,

33
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,010
a spurt of dust blows across my face.
Again,

34
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,870
several bullets pass so close to my head
that I feel shockwaves as they go by

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,160
to the left and AK 47 assault
rifle opens up. Then another,

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,130
I'm pinned in a crossfire
without cover or concealment.

37
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,340
A crippled sitting duck in a kill zone
at least a hundred meters long and 75

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,083
deep.

39
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,280
Okay.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,640
With my right hand, I key the radio
handset I have mounted on my chest,

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,150
troops in contact troops in contact,
I called him my command.

42
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,720
We have three severely wounded,
including me.

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,350
Okay.

44
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,050
Static greets my words.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,800
I can't duck.
I can't crawl away.

46
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,570
There's no place to hide. All I can do
is ignore the incoming fire and stay

47
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,630
the PK. I'm a gunner. PKM
gunner finds the range,

48
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,180
bullets crack around me,

49
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,100
dirt flies.

50
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,170
The terrorist eases up on the tripper
trigger, but only for a second

51
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,490
I hear him on leash, another burst, then

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,730
I hear nothing at all.

53
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,893
Okay.

54
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,650
And those right there are some excerpts
from the opening chapter of a book

55
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:40,800
called the Trident,

56
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,940
which is written by a retired seal
officer by the name of Jason Jay Redmond.

57
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,940
And this book does an incredible job
not only of bringing the reader to the

58
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:03,210
front lines in some pretty
chaotic combat situations,

59
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,250
but equally important,

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,360
it brings the reader into the challenges
of leadership and the challenges of

61
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:17,370
life, especially the challenges
of facing significant adversity.

62
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,470
And Jay's book humbly splays those
challenges wide open for all to see.

63
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,780
And that humility from Jay is what
makes this book so beneficial.

64
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,990
He tells us plainly and bluntly of
his personal triumphs and tragedies is

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,560
victories and his defeats and how he
eventually found success and overcame by

66
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:03,720
travelling the path of humility.

67
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,140
And since I have the honor
of actually knowing Jay,

68
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,410
he is been kind enough to come by this
evening and talk about his experiences

69
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,090
with us. So with that, Mr j Redmond,

70
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,000
thanks for stopping by brother
Jocko rather echo. Thank you. Good.

71
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,940
Thank you both for having me on. Awesome.
Awesome to have you sitting here, man.

72
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,010
Hey Man, honor to still be here.
Blessed, that's for sure. You know,

73
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:39,040
like I tell so many people I'm
living on a second chance, you know,

74
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,410
you and I got too many
brothers who are not,

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,530
I don't know why the big man decided
to give me a chance, but, uh,

76
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm making the most of it.
Okay. Outstanding. So, uh,

77
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,190
I wanna try and start a little bit at
the beginning so people get a little bit

78
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:58,100
familiar with where you are. Everyone
always wants to know where people, where

79
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,950
people came from, how they grew up.
I'm going to the book right here.

80
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,880
I came from a family with a rich
tradition of service. So in retrospect,

81
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,720
this made sense.

82
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,040
My Dad was a US army airborne rigor at
Fort Campbell during the Vietnam War.

83
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,020
My paternal grandfather
earned a distinguished flying
cross while piloting a B

84
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:19,070
24 liberator bomber over the flack
filled skies of Hitler's Europe.

85
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,090
I also had a great uncle who flew fighter
aircraft and the southwest Pacific

86
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,230
during World War II.

87
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,850
He made the ultimate sacrifice
in battle against the Japanese.

88
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,240
I dreamed of adding to that legacy,

89
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,840
a life of combat metals and service.

90
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,680
I was young and naive and had a

91
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,080
long road to travel before I could
truly understand what my grandfather and

92
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,330
great uncle gave for the country.

93
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,940
But that idealism became
a very big part of me.

94
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,300
I wanted to carry a rifle for a living.

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,220
My Dad watched this desire grow
in me and decided to focus it.

96
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,300
My freshman year in high school. He sat
me down in our tiny living room and said,

97
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:05,020
you know, Jay, we had these guys
come through airborne school.

98
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,530
They were us navy called seals.

99
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,090
They jumped out of airplanes,
swam. They bluets blew stuff up.

100
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,920
Given how you love the water,
maybe you ought to look into them.

101
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,050
So your dad planted the seed, Huh? It did?
Yeah. A young age. And you know, this was

102
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,950
90, probably, uh, or I'm sorry, um,

103
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,830
probably 89 show, 88, 89.

104
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,330
So back then you really couldn't find
hardly anything about the seal teams.

105
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,040
And uh,

106
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,110
this was at a point in time
where Gi Joe was big. I mean,

107
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:50,400
I'm a, you know, 13, 12,
13 year old kid into that.

108
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,460
And then I was probably about 14 when
my dad told me about the seal teams and

109
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:59,250
uh, started researching
it, found almost nothing.

110
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,930
And by sheer happenstance,

111
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:05,931
one of the guys in our church was
a huge special operations buff.

112
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,760
Uh, he was a guy that was
unable to go in the military.

113
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:11,610
He had had polio actually
when he was a kid,

114
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,130
but he was just infatuated by it.

115
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,870
And he had done tons of research and he
actually had collected some things about

116
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:19,980
the seal teams.

117
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:24,860
He had an old soldier of
Fortune Magazine Day. Yeah.

118
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,780
Awesome. It's so different nowadays
know nowadays you just Google it.

119
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,100
I exactly back in the day,

120
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:33,280
you had to be lucky enough to know some
dude in church who happened to have a

121
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:36,970
copy of the issue of soldier of Fortune
magazine. Is that still a thing?

122
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,660
And it would a fortune still out
there dude. It actually is. Uh,

123
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,930
as a matter of fact,
somehow in some weird twist of fate,

124
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,010
I ended up being on the cover of soldier
of fortune and after the book came out

125
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,590
and it was the most bizarre
thing because now you know,

126
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,170
you're in the military and
you look at this stage,

127
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,560
you kind of laugh at soldier of fortune.
It's a little bit,

128
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,010
uh,
you

129
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,010
know,
really focuses on probably the,

130
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,950
the Gung Ho aspect of sof as
opposed to you came full circle,

131
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,440
full circle, that's for sure.
Field of soldier fortune.
It was, it was pretty funny.

132
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,400
But um,

133
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,700
but that magazine and that journey of
coming to understand who these guys were

134
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:18,510
that you really couldn't find much about
them. It just drew me in even more.

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,890
And the only thing,

136
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,780
the core thread that I found over and
over again was toughest training in the

137
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,720
military. And, you
know, I was a young kid,

138
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:32,721
I was a small kid and I just had this
inner fire that if you told me I couldn't

139
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,570
do something, it just drove
me even more to want to do it.

140
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,150
And everyone, you know, at
that point in my life, uh,

141
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,040
that's probably four foot
11 and about 95 pounds.

142
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,130
So when I told people I
was going to become a seal,

143
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:52,020
they laughed me out of the room. And
that just fueled me even harder. And,

144
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:56,430
uh, I set my sights on that dream
and that's where I was going.

145
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:59,220
And you use some of the things you
did or you started playing football,

146
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,580
you started getting involved in sports
to make sure you were physically fit and

147
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,570
all that.
So that was part of the driving factor.

148
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:09,571
It's part of any good way
to sort of prepare at least
in a minimum way for buds.

149
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,690
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I wanted to
build a mindset. I knew that fitness,

150
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:19,110
I knew that being part of a team, I knew
that pushing myself in different areas.

151
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:22,860
So I started wrestling and I started
playing football and I was smallest guy on

152
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:26,940
our team. But man, I just, I love
football. I've always loved football.

153
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:29,760
My Dad had always told me, no,
you're too small. You're too small,

154
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:34,690
you're going to get hurt.
And uh, so probably my 10th
grade year I said, you know,

155
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,030
I don't care what you're telling me,
I'm going out for the team. And uh,

156
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,480
thankfully we lived in a
really small town and uh,

157
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,540
I think they would take anyone and they
looked at me and they say, well, you know,

158
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,890
we can at least use you as a tackling
dummy. And a, and I said, Roger, that,

159
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:52,500
I'll do it, man. Awesome.
You know, I will, you know,

160
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,370
I'll hit somebody as hard
as my 95 pounds cam and uh,

161
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,810
got out there and just, I love the
sport. You know, I was, you know,

162
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,830
not a starter in any way, but, uh,

163
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,110
I was out there every day just grinding
and I'd try and lay the hardest hits

164
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:10,020
that I could on people.
And I played receiver and
cornerback and Nice. Yeah. Now.

165
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,440
I was also a little bit as a,
as I read through the book,

166
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,200
kind of piecing together what you
were like when you were a kid.

167
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,700
I got to this point here.

168
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,610
I know that she's kind of a little
bit of a different direction.

169
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:24,420
Going back to the book at the same time,
I fell in with the wrong crowd.

170
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,410
I got a job my junior year and
my work friends were drinkers.

171
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,710
I started sneaking out of the house by
sliding down the intent to pull outside

172
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,530
my window. I'd meet with
friends, we'd go drink.

173
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:38,040
I'd stagger home drunk at odd hours of
the night, scaling the side of the House.

174
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,750
With the help of that Pole, my family
tried to nudge me into course correction,

175
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,590
but I had a chip on my shoulder and
refuse to listen, especially to my dad.

176
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:47,640
Things got worse.

177
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,900
My relationship with my father and step
mom spiraled out of control into the

178
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:56,290
ground. Months of this war us
all down. As that slide continued

179
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,460
that that happens, right? I mean
that's straight up happens to kids,

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,900
especially boys. And I think it has to
do with, I'm going to prove myself. I,

181
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,820
that's what I think, hey,
I'm going to prove myself.

182
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,330
And one of the ways that
you prove yourself is by
proving that you're willing to

183
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,800
sacrifice in a way.

184
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,270
And what better way when you're
16 years old to prove is like, oh,

185
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:25,660
watch what I'll do. I'll drink,
I'll drink this whole bottle.

186
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,040
And I think that leads to young
males doing a lot of dumb stuff.

187
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:34,290
And it sounds like you were right on
board. Absolutely. You know, the, the,

188
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,860
the thing that shaped me though,

189
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:40,680
there's where I got really lucky as I
was smart enough and, and disciplined.

190
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,270
I have to understand that,
uh,

191
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,690
if I got myself in any
kind of major trouble,

192
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,800
I wouldn't be able to go in
the seal teams. So like I said,

193
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:55,030
we lived in a real small town in
rural North Carolina and you know,

194
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:59,920
drugs were prevalent. Um, and a lot of my
friends were starting to get into that.

195
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,910
And I just said, man, if I get, you know,
that'll stop me from going in the navy.

196
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:08,130
So at least there was kind of a line I
wasn't willing to cross. Uh, and I'm,

197
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:11,560
I'm fortunate there were a couple of
times we got ourselves in trouble where,

198
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,190
you know, we were right on the edge of
the law being involved and you know,

199
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:19,300
we managed to dodge that
bullet, but, uh, yeah,

200
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,280
I wanted to get out there,
I wanted to fit in.

201
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:24,730
So I think it's a combination of both
peer pressure as a young man, you know,

202
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:28,000
I want to fit in with this group.
Uh, but I have my hopes and dreams,

203
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,530
so this is the direction I'm going.

204
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,930
And I think that's where a lot
of young men get off track.

205
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,160
They want to fit in so much that they
give up on their hopes and dreams and that

206
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:38,830
gets sucked down this path. Uh, for me,

207
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:43,270
I had such a laser focus on
what I wanted to do that, uh,

208
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,010
it at least kept me in check.

209
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,780
Yeah. I will say this, just
to kind of add to that point,

210
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,020
from my perspective,
if you,

211
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,500
if you've got someone that's
aspiring to do something, you know,

212
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,420
hire the people that don't have those
aspirations are more than happy to try and

213
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,260
crush that dream for him and more
than happy to pull them down.

214
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,900
And so I've found that throughout life,

215
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,230
if you have some high aspiration
that you're trying to achieve,

216
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,840
where you see someone that's
got high aspirations that
they're trying to achieve,

217
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,230
you can watch the people around them.
If they're not good,

218
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:20,040
people will try to rip those things and
pull them down and pull them off that

219
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,690
track. Scary. I, and it's funny

220
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,350
equivocally true. I mean it's
one of the tenants, you know,

221
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,200
I now speak on something I call
the Pentagon at peak performance.

222
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,030
And the fifth level is, or I'm sorry,
the fourth level is social leadership.

223
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,650
So how we lead ourselves, how we build
our ring of friends and influencers and,

224
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,210
and your unequivocally right,

225
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,170
a great influence or an entrepreneur
I've been recently working with,

226
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,410
he gives an amazing analogy of,

227
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:49,920
he was up in Alaska on a vacation.

228
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,130
He was walking the beach and there was

229
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,700
a fisherman that was fishing with a net
and catching crabs and he was putting

230
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,320
the crabs in a bucket and you know,

231
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:02,321
it's early morning and the guys name
Bedros Keuilian and Pedro's was watching

232
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:03,950
this happen,
you know,

233
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:07,640
early in the morning and looked in the
bucket and there was about 10 crabs and

234
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,660
probably about five gallon bucket and
probably about eight inches of water.

235
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,980
And he kept watching his one crab would
climb up and grab on to the edge of the

236
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:20,480
bucket and try and pull itself out. And
he like tells the fishermen, hey man,

237
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,790
I want to let you know you're
going to lose one of your crops.

238
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,690
And the fishermen doesn't even
turn around and look at it,

239
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,640
keeps throwing his neck and he goes,
watch what happens.

240
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,310
And Vedros kind of steps back and he
looks down into the bucket and he watches

241
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:38,570
his all the other crabs grab onto that
other crab and pull him back down.

242
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,300
And he had this epiphany moment of the
circles of influence he had in his life

243
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:47,540
and he was like, oh my God, I
have crabs in my life. He's like,

244
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:52,340
I have people that I want to climb up and
be better and they're pulling me down.

245
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,170
And it is unequivocally true.

246
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,960
I mean it's something I brought up to
the bud students yesterday. I said,

247
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,840
if you want to be the best seal,

248
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,620
you need to surround yourself with
the guys who are driven discipline and

249
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:06,980
they're pushing themselves to the edge.
If you want to go to the next level,

250
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:10,100
you need to surround yourself with the
guys who were either already there or

251
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,360
they aspire to get there.

252
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,470
Because if you're going to
surround yourself with people
who are content to just

253
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,110
drink and not move forward at all,

254
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,260
they're going to try and pull you into
that circle because they're going to feel

255
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,930
threatened that you don't
want to do what they're doing.

256
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,720
And they want you to assimilate with them.

257
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,960
Verse driving forward and being
successful. It's unfortunate.

258
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,440
It's just kind of a way of
life. It's a, it's a horrible,

259
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,820
it's a horrible situation. So watch
out for it because it's everywhere.

260
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,040
So you end up, so you graduated
high school and go to a
recruiter and boom. Right.

261
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:47,210
I mean any, any other particular things
around the recruitment process? Yeah,

262
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:52,160
the recruitment process was actually,
I actually kind of got off track a little.

263
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,690
So I went to the recruiting station. I
as soon as I decided I want to be a seal,

264
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:58,970
I went to the recruiting station.
So I was 15 years old,

265
00:16:58,971 --> 00:17:03,620
this 95 pound weakling and walk into
the recruiting station and unlike, Hey,

266
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:07,670
I want to be a seal.
And there was an old crusty,

267
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:10,940
I mean he was like an old
school probably 25 years,

268
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:15,290
e six and just crusty as all get out,
you know,

269
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:20,240
boatswain's mate. And that dude basically
laughed me out of the office was like,

270
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,240
get Outta here. Stop
wasting our time. You know,

271
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,470
you couldn't even carry the paddle.
Much less the boat, you know,

272
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,490
get out of my office.
And it didn't phase me in the least.

273
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:35,510
I came back like next week and was
like, I want to be a seal. And uh,

274
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,300
they,
this guy chased me out of the office.

275
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:42,470
I came back about four or five times and
he just continued to not even give me

276
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:46,970
the time of day.
So finally I was kinda tired of that.

277
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,400
I try the way things are real rough when
the recruiter won't give a kid the time

278
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:55,170
of day. Yeah. Try to make that
quota. This is hardcore. Oh Man.

279
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,620
Yeah. Well, I mean, you think about
a 25 year, he's six. He, yeah,

280
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:03,140
he was at a point he didn't
really care. So, uh, you know,

281
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,940
when I got to the point,
uh,

282
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,710
I came back again probably about eight
months later and at this point I had

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,750
really started to train. I was focused
on it. I didn't let him determine me.

284
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,190
And I came back and he had left just
by sheer happenstance. He was gone.

285
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:21,630
And there was a new recruiter in there, a
guy by the name of Henry Horn. Um, Henry,

286
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:23,250
if you're out there
and you listen to this,

287
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:25,500
I've never been able to
track him down and thank him.

288
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,190
But Henry took me in and was like,
yeah man, absolutely sit down.

289
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,400
And they had this video,
you may remember this be someone special.

290
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,540
And it was the cheesiest,
it was like 1980s video at uh,

291
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,880
at its best. And uh, and it
was this high speed, you know,

292
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:45,630
the seals come in on a helicopter and
they'd get out and they take down this

293
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,820
target and take out these
terrorists and you know, the,

294
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:52,830
the tagline is be someone special.
And I just ate it up man.

295
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,790
And uh,
came back on a regular basis and a,

296
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,570
and Henry was fantastic. He told me, these
are the things you need to do, you know,

297
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:04,920
AskPat fitness, this is what's
going to happen. So went to, uh,

298
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,940
went to go sign up, you know,
right. As I was turning 17,

299
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:12,780
I was going to do the delayed entry
program and I went to go sign up and went,

300
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,370
mmm. Um, well I've got
a backup for a second.

301
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,080
There was a glitch. I'm sorry.
I've got my facts backwards here.

302
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,880
I actually,
because of the deal with the crusty e six,

303
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,110
I was, uh, and him being a block to me,

304
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,040
I changed my mind inside to go army.
At first, Henry happened after this,

305
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,030
I'm sorry, I got that backwards. Henry
happened after this and when I went back,

306
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,180
I decided to join the army. I
said, well, fine. My Dad, you know,

307
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,700
he was army the Rangers,
I'll go the green baret route.

308
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,090
So I went to meps to pro or
to do my intake screening
for the army delayed entry

309
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:54,990
program. And I failed the
physical because when I was a kid,

310
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:59,070
I had ruptured my eardrum and I had a
lot of scar tissue on my eardrum and the

311
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:01,290
army said, oh, well, you're not
going to be able to equalize.

312
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,280
So they tried to convince me
to still go in. They were like,

313
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,740
oh well you don't have to be
an airborne ranger. You know,

314
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:11,640
you can do this or you can do that. You
can drive trucks. And I was like, no man,

315
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:12,720
that's not what I want to do.

316
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,170
So I left and I didn't sign up and
probably a couple months went by and then

317
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,610
that's when I came back and the crusties
six was gone and Henry Horn was there

318
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:27,960
and really helped pave that path. So
kind of an interesting road. And uh,

319
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,890
I think the lesson is this is there's
always going to be roadblocks that are

320
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:35,040
going to deter you from your dreams.
You know, don't let it stop you.

321
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,280
Keep driving forward,
uh, cause by, you know,

322
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:41,250
if I just listened to that guy
right from the beginning, you know,

323
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,260
I never would have been a seal. So
you go in, you show up at Bud's.

324
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:48,040
I like this as a good,
going back

325
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,140
to the book, your, your intro to Bud's,

326
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:54,760
one night I was as ordered to escort a
member of class one 99 back to his room.

327
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:59,761
Building in six oh two he'd
quit the program and the
navy required an escort for

328
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,380
anyone who rang the bell.
During hell week,

329
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,800
I went off to find him in the darkness.
He was waiting for me.

330
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:09,850
A smaller guy like me wrapped in a
blanket. He was shivering so badly.

331
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:14,200
He seemed ready to fly apart. He'd put
the blanket over his head like a hood,

332
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,550
giving him a monastic look.
He said little.

333
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:22,660
So we made our way to the barracks and
silence. I walked alongside him, fit,

334
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,850
fit to burst, wanting to get any details
on what I'd soon experience. Finally,

335
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:31,930
I couldn't stand it anymore.
As you reached his door and opened it,

336
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,080
I blurted out. So come
on, man. What was it like?

337
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,340
He turned to me and looked me in the eyes.
His rooms,

338
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,060
night light cast an orange
glow across his face.

339
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,830
His skin was waxen and he
looked hollowed out at length.

340
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:52,660
He answered in a slow earnest
tone. Dude, it was so cold.

341
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,950
I would have poured gasoline all over
myself and little match just so I could

342
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:00,280
have been warm for a few seconds
before I burned to death.

343
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,790
He stepped back without another word
and slammed his door for the first time.

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,190
I wondered what I'd gotten myself into.

345
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,550
That's legit right there.
Intro to buds.

346
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,560
So there's a, so not only did
that blow my mind, uh, you know,

347
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:23,950
there's a funny little side story.
We actually had to edit that.

348
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,590
So the fire thing,
uh,

349
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,260
we actually created because
what he actually, he told
me that exact thing, the,

350
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,670
so the,
the dialogue is the same,

351
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,360
but what he told me was about
as vulgar as all get out.

352
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:40,660
It would have made the
book rated triple x and a,

353
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:43,630
and it was so mind blowing because
I mean, you know, the fire thing,

354
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,510
we tried to come up with what
is as impactful as possible,

355
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,630
but it does not convey,
I'll let your imaginations run wild.

356
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:52,480
But what he told me and he
slammed the door in my face,

357
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:57,340
left me so stunned that I was like,
what the hell did I get myself into?

358
00:22:57,341 --> 00:23:00,710
I mean it was, but we could not put it in
the boat. I mean it was so bad. I mean,

359
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:02,640
I was like,
my kids can never read that

360
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,650
chuck check. So, uh, anyways,
I mean then you get there,

361
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:13,651
but you go through buds
and buds is cool and you,

362
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,700
you write about buds a little bit in here,

363
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:18,160
but you don't spend a bunch of
time on it because as we know,

364
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:21,160
buds is not a huge part of
our careers in the seal teams.

365
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,240
And I'm going to jump right right ahead to

366
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,210
the book here.
Seven years in,

367
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:31,180
three South American deployments
into my career as a seal.

368
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,680
I found myself in Fort Knox,

369
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:36,580
Kentucky working as a basic warfare
instructor with a small group of fellow

370
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:41,110
operators. We worked 18 hour days,
but being 20 something and single,

371
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,000
once the gear was stowed,

372
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,900
all we wanted to do was get out on the
town and blow off some steam. Work hard,

373
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:52,010
play hard.
That was our pre nine 11 mantra.

374
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,120
The nineties teams
work hard,

375
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:00,740
play hard.
Uh,

376
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,810
I always have to explain to people how
cool it is being in the teams being an e

377
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,190
five and the teams or what were you
any fibernet sex at this point? Uh,

378
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:12,380
I was in new five e five and the teams,

379
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,380
and I was telling the story the other day,
this,

380
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,890
when I got to seal team one that
there was, I was a new guy in,

381
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,460
was quietly walking through the locker
room trying to keep my eyes averted from

382
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:27,000
looking at anyone. And
I hear this guy go, ah,

383
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,420
yes. And I was like, oh my God.

384
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,660
And it was this like barbaric yell
from this human being a who is one.

385
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,290
And then I looked at him and he
was this monster guy, probably six,

386
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,880
seven,
six,

387
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:44,960
six 280 pounds of tattooed flesh.

388
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,400
And someone's like, what
happened? And he goes,

389
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,380
I just made e five master
chief is far as I'm concerned.

390
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,690
So yeah, you know, you get to be an e five
in a seal platoon, you know, you've got,

391
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,750
if you, if you're not looking for
a lost a lot of responsibility,

392
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,440
you won't find it. But
you won't, you know,

393
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,440
you're a little bit above some of the
crap work. So it's not a bad place to be.

394
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:15,830
And that's where you were doing
during deployment, after deployment,

395
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,240
three deployments to uh,

396
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,300
South America and doing
the training gig where you,

397
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,030
were you at training cell at the team at
this time or was it already consolidate

398
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,360
data? No, each team had a Joan
individual training still. Yup.

399
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,440
I did that too.

400
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,360
And this is also the time during one of
these trips where you met your future

401
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:39,750
wife. That's right. So you know, you know,

402
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:44,250
the seal teams are an interesting place
because being an all male unit, you know,

403
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,790
the only time you have an opportunity to
meet people ladies is typically in the

404
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:52,730
bars. And because we did such a good
job, you know, I tell people, uh,

405
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,800
the mindset of the early teams
really was, you know, uh,

406
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,800
you know, Marcinko captured that
mindset and his book the road warrior.

407
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,900
But it's interesting to see post nine 11,

408
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:08,460
how guys are so laser focused
on combat, you know, but for us,

409
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,310
you know, literally we trained
hard and then you know,

410
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:14,610
you were actually looked down on if you
didn't go out and party and burn it down

411
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:17,910
to like four in the morning and then get
an hour of sleep and get up and start

412
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,580
training again the next day,
which was just stupid, you know,

413
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:24,630
you weren't operating at
optimal efficiency, but that
was just the way it was.

414
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,980
That was life and a accepted
it and drove through. So yeah,

415
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:33,300
I was fortunate enough one
night we went into a, a crazy,

416
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,210
huge bar that somebody had
scouted out and said, hey man,

417
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:41,000
this is a target rich environment. And
uh, the Phoenix Hill tavern. And uh,

418
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,520
went in there and yeah,
beautiful blonde

419
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,480
walked in and I was like,
I need to get to know this young lady.

420
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:54,600
You did. All right, man. Uh, along
along the course of this, um,

421
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,350
you apply for the CME to animal program,

422
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,880
which is the same program I did.

423
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:02,880
I think you were a couple of years
behind me and we're going to the book.

424
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:05,280
I had applied to the semen,
to admiral program something.

425
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:08,820
The navy started to encourage top
performing enlisted to become officers.

426
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,540
Only 50 candidates a year were accepted
back then to the competition was fierce.

427
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,010
I gained a slot in the navy,

428
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:18,360
sent me to college just in time
to miss the outbreak of the war.

429
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,360
I watched the towers fall.

430
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,680
I recognize the magnitude of the moment
and left school and a days fully aware

431
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:30,180
that our country was heading to war.
With three years of college ahead of me,

432
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:35,070
I feared I'd miss my chance to be
a part of it. A few days later,

433
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:40,550
I drove back to my old seal team to see
my former CEO and mentor commander Vince

434
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,110
Peterson.

435
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,980
He had stuck his neck out for me more
than once and had been instrumental in

436
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:49,830
getting me a shot,
a slot in the semen admiral program.

437
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,880
I told them I wanted to drop out of school
so I could get back to a platoon and

438
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,650
help with the war effort. Commander
Peterson sat listening quietly as he,

439
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,710
as I explained my desire to come back.
He was a legend in the seal teams.

440
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,210
He had been a former marine before joining
the navy and headed to seal training

441
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:11,211
at the age of 36 he was highly respected
both up and down the chain of command.

442
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,010
In my leadership fence analogy,

443
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:16,530
most men fell on one side
of the fence or the other.

444
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,730
While there were those small few who had
the unique ability to stand on top and

445
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:24,360
move back and forth for Vince Peterson,
there was no fence.

446
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,130
As I sat down with him and asked
him to put me back in the platoon,

447
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,810
he looked me dead in the eye and said,
read. This will not be a short war.

448
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,710
It's going to go on for years and
we're going to need strong warriors and

449
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:41,460
leaders for upcoming battles.
You need to stay in school.

450
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,410
Then come back and lead

451
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,880
check
I,

452
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,190
when I read that,
of course I thought about,

453
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,320
guess what I was doing
when nine 11 happened,

454
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,980
I was in college as well
all in the same program.

455
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:04,610
That's probably a year or two
ahead of you. And guess what I did,

456
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,410
same thing.

457
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,410
I called the detailer who was a friend
of mine who I'd worked for and I said,

458
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,100
hey, I don't care about
college. I'll do online.

459
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,450
I don't care about any of this. Sent me
back to a seal team right now please.

460
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,310
And you know this individual to is
as well. And I know who this guy is.

461
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,710
And the,
he told me the exact same thing.

462
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,630
He said this war is going to last
a long time. Yeah, of course.

463
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:36,530
I didn't believe it. And it, you know,

464
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,040
and this is what's interesting. I
recently saw the guy that called and I saw

465
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,040
him and his wife who I know his wife and
she's a great person and I was telling

466
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:52,240
her this, telling you this and you know,
she said it was so awesome to hear.

467
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,030
She goes, do you know how
many calls he got that day?

468
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,760
So there was zero unique
about Jocko calling the,

469
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,780
the CLD Taylor insane, sir. Get
me back to a team right now.

470
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,590
Every single guy that wasn't an a
seal team. And the teams or if we,

471
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:12,650
everyone that a B billet of any
kind was calling the detail insane.

472
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,330
Kippy back to a t you put me in coach.
Yeah.

473
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,120
And it goes to that meant telling
you were talking about we, we were,

474
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,090
we were just training and training and
training and it'd be like training for a

475
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,000
game and training for the
Superbowl and never get to play.

476
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,610
So you,
you,

477
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:37,660
so you actually did a great job in
college and you, you, you are an ROTC too,

478
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,100
right? Oh, it was, yeah.

479
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,120
See I got the real scam deal where I just
went to college and it wasn't wearing

480
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:46,780
a uniform. I was like far enough
ahead of you that I got the deal.

481
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,280
You were in the original program,

482
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:52,120
so you got commissioned and went to school
is an officer say you're getting paid

483
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:55,210
officer pay check. I go to school.
I got the most ridiculous deal.

484
00:30:55,211 --> 00:31:00,160
I apologize to the taxpayers, I think.
And the navy quickly realized, okay, yeah,

485
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,270
we screwed this one up. So I think it
took them two iterations. Yeah. I was in,

486
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,770
because I think I was in the third
iteration, third or fourth, but, uh, no,

487
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:12,790
we actually were required to be
a part of ROTC. So, you know,

488
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,190
every day we were,
we were up early and we,

489
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,250
and the Hampton roads in ROTC at that
time was the largest ROTC consortium on

490
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,770
the east coast.
So you had a Hampton University,

491
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:26,770
you had Odu Old Dominion University
and you had Norfolk state.

492
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:31,600
And they had at that time probably about,
I think we were at about 330,

493
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,660
a Midshipman,
an officer candidates,

494
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:38,460
and we had a huge contingent
of x enlisted. Uh,

495
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,790
so there was actually,

496
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,750
it was probably six or seven seals and
the program there at that time. Um,

497
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,880
so it was good. I had teammates to
go through with, but uh, yeah man,

498
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,050
we played all the games and real quickly
I realized, I said, okay, you know,

499
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:55,090
they want it, you've got
to step up, you know,

500
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:57,070
they're going to put you into
these different positions.

501
00:31:57,071 --> 00:32:00,820
And a lot of the guys who had come there
before me were kind of like, no dude,

502
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:03,520
we don't want to do anything. We don't
want to be involved. We just want to,

503
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,590
you know, a lot of
times, typical team guys,

504
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,540
we want to create our
own little circle of,

505
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,920
of trust and we don't want to let anybody
else in the circle. And I was like,

506
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,800
Nah man, we got to change
that mindset. You know,

507
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:19,000
there's young kids here that we could
influence to become future frogmen I shed.

508
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:22,990
And uh, cause there was no, they had all
these communities at the school. They had,

509
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,700
uh, they had, you know, surface warfare
community. They had the aviation club,

510
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:32,080
they had the sub Mariner club,
but there was no special operations club.

511
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,040
And there were young kids were interested
in. I said, Whoa, we need to create this,

512
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,440
you know, we have the experience,
we can help these kids.

513
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,040
And then the other thing I said is I

514
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,480
said, well, you know,

515
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,220
I'm going to try and step
up into leadership positions
and I think all the rest

516
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:49,550
of us to do the same. And, uh, and
thankfully, you know, it worked.

517
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,610
We all jumped on board. And
you know, I was fortunate,

518
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:57,050
I did excel in school and I
ended up leaving the school
as the student battalion,

519
00:32:57,051 --> 00:33:01,190
commanding officer. Uh, prior
to being commissioned to am,

520
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:07,210
I was the regimental commander at
officer candidate school and that was,

521
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:13,310
you know, the number one
position. And I was a man. Yeah.

522
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:18,311
I was talking to my mom
and I mentioned to him,

523
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:23,300
which I shouldn't have done because my
mom just doesn't understand. I was like,

524
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,470
well yeah, I'm, I'm, you know,

525
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm the registries because at the last
couple of weeks of ocs and she's like,

526
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:30,110
listen,
what's going on now?

527
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:33,050
Cause then I could call cause you
weren't allowed to call. So I said, well,

528
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,780
we're doing this and I'm in
charge of the thing here.

529
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,930
It's called the regimental commander.
And she goes, oh, what he you,

530
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,490
you're the commander? And I said,
yeah, I'm the regimental commander.

531
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:46,250
And she goes on, are you
in charge of? And I said,

532
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:51,550
I am overseeing the cleaning of every
toilet at officer candidate school and

533
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:55,580
it's going quite well. So
yeah. Spotless, spotless,

534
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,100
uh,
you.

535
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,160
So you do a great job in college and now
you go back to the teams after college.

536
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:07,790
Going back to the book,
instead of having an advantage,

537
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,070
I found myself left behind.

538
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,300
Everything had changed and as our
platoon went through its training cycle,

539
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,280
I always felt like I was playing catch up.

540
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,520
I made mistakes and exercises that I've
never made in the 90s they made me edgy

541
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:22,610
and tense,

542
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,360
feeling the pressure of trying to be a
leader and drinking from that training

543
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:31,220
fire hose. At the same time, I
got tight and held on even harder,

544
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:35,060
which only made things
worse in our time off.

545
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,030
I drowned my frustrations
and booze and routinely,

546
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,040
routinely made an ass of myself.

547
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,760
None of this was helping my credibility
with the men I was supposed to be

548
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:46,670
leading,
but I didn't see that at the moment.

549
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,970
It also didn't help that senior chief,
Pete,

550
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:53,600
Carrie and I despised each other
almost from our introduction.

551
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,160
He was a good skilled seal and I
respected as tactical abilities,

552
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:01,820
but I felt his people skills were
lacking rough and abrasive at times.

553
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:03,650
His leadership style clashed with mine,

554
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,190
which set us on a collision course.

555
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,680
While I privately railed against Kerry,

556
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,860
I was too blinded by
arrogance to see my own flaws.

557
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,070
I wasn't making a good
transition to being an officer.

558
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,720
I'd been enlisted for so long.

559
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,730
I identified with my enlisted teammates
more as one of them rather than as one

560
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:26,630
of their leaders.
It put me too far away from the fence.

561
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,490
The senior chief and the Aoi see are
supposed to work closely together to make

562
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:33,290
sure the team functions effectively.

563
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,940
The AIC and that's assistant officer in
charge is also supposed to learn from

564
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:43,170
the chiefs tactical experience that
never happened in our platoon. Instead,

565
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:47,490
I refuse to humble myself and listened
to the senior chief as the pre deployment

566
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:48,600
workup wore on.

567
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,290
I wouldn't con we w we couldn't
conceal our dislike for each other.

568
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,270
The feud spilled out into the open and
culminated with a public screaming match

569
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,920
in Europe after a tactical
exercise with some NATO allies

570
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,690
in the weeks that followed
my arrival within the team,

571
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,570
our relationship became the
cancer in our locker room.

572
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:11,960
By the time we got to Afghanistan,
we refused to be civil to each other.

573
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,620
I had lost touch entirely with what it
meant to be a leader during the daily

574
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:18,470
briefs.
We would openly take shots at each other.

575
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,680
I talked about this dynamic
many times with my superior,

576
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:25,550
the platoons officer in charge one
day the OIC finally said, look,

577
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:28,340
you do have to work this out.
I'm tired of it.

578
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,330
We never could or did work things out.

579
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,440
Different platoons structure things
in different ways. In Our platoon,

580
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:39,560
senior enlisted members acted as fire
team leaders with chiefs and some more

581
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:42,140
experienced officers acting as
the assault force commanders.

582
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,680
I had been assigned as neither.
If I'd taken a step back,

583
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:49,310
I might have realized that I hadn't
given my Bosch as much confidence in my

584
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:54,260
leadership, but I didn't see that. I
only felt slighted. And in bittered

585
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,470
rough tour. Yeah, but
all brought on by myself.

586
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:06,090
I mean, you know, the dynamics
obviously created some interesting,

587
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,650
uh, you know, problems. But
you know, as often happens,

588
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:15,651
I wasn't taking ownership of
my own actions and instead
was just kind of trying

589
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:19,140
to point fingers
externally. Well, you know,

590
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:23,370
it's peak carries fault that these
things are happening when the reality was

591
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,170
80% of it was me, you know, 80% of it.

592
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,430
So it's one of the things that I
talked to a lot of individuals about.

593
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,380
I think you see it in special operations.

594
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:38,900
I know you and I both have spoken
to professional sports teams. Uh,

595
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:44,030
I see it there were young men Xcelerate
quickly and achieve this elite status

596
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:48,990
and then you get a little bit of a namerd
with who they are and their abilities

597
00:37:48,991 --> 00:37:52,860
and lose sight of the end state,

598
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,790
which is to be an effective part of the
team to do their jobs. So ruthlessly,

599
00:37:56,791 --> 00:38:00,570
well, it, it plays this huge part in
the team and at the end of the day,

600
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,670
whether you're in professional sports,

601
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,530
whether you're in the seal teams or even
whether you're in some elite business,

602
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,330
you know,
that's what has to happen.

603
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:14,390
And I lost sight of that and I'm more
focused externally instead of internally.

604
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:20,870
And really now I speak a lot on what
my three rules of leadership is.

605
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,050
And the foundational,

606
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:27,051
the first rule is lead yourself
and how you lead yourself.

607
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,150
80% of leadership is leading yourself.
You know,

608
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:33,570
you talk so much about discipline, it's
how you discipline yourself. Tell you,

609
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:36,910
structured yourself, it's how you,
yourself. It's how you set the example.

610
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,070
And in doing so,

611
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,330
it automatically leads to rule number two,
lead others.

612
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,630
It almost makes it easy to lead others
because you've already done all the work.

613
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,820
They want to follow you because
you're setting the example.

614
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,060
I kind of had it backwards.
I was trying to lead others,

615
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:56,110
but I wasn't leading myself and
it's almost impossible to do.

616
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,330
And I meet all these people,
you know,

617
00:38:58,331 --> 00:39:01,750
that I've gone out in business and
talk to them. They say, Jay, man,

618
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,620
how do I be a better leader? And you know,
my first question I always ask them is,

619
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:10,060
how well do you lead yourself?
Uh, because that's where I really,

620
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:13,210
really failed. We talk, you know,

621
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:16,570
and the several times you've mentioned
a principle I talk about called the

622
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:21,571
leadership fence and leadership fence
was just kind of a concept I came up with

623
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:25,150
after watching a lot of really
good leaders and bad leaders,

624
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:28,330
including myself in that
category. Um, you know,

625
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:30,670
years later I looked back
and the idea was this,

626
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,360
that imagine a chain link fence and,

627
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,850
and that fence represents where
you are in your leadership journey.

628
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,810
And on one side of the fence
are all those you lead.

629
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,680
And on the other side are those
you report to your superiors.

630
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,060
Everybody has a natural tendency to kind
of fall on one side of the fence or the

631
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:53,440
other depending on how they grew up or
how they came into the organization. Um,

632
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,950
for me,
obviously when you start out as an e one,

633
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,840
I connected a lot more with the guys on
the side of the fence and I was leading,

634
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,580
uh, as a matter of fact,
the teams back then, uh,

635
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,730
typically wanted to switch coasts
with guys. If you're an enlisted guy,

636
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:13,140
they want to send you out to
the opposite coast. And, uh,

637
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,070
that didn't happen for me.
And I tell you what,

638
00:40:15,071 --> 00:40:19,090
I look back on that now and I think
that was a mistake. Uh, I, you know,

639
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:22,810
I created a lot of my own problems
and the seal teams were right in their

640
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:27,811
thinking on how to do that because now
the hardest leadership often is pure

641
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:31,240
leadership, you know, to break
through those bonds of, Hey,

642
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,660
you and I were both friends,
but now I'm in charge of you.

643
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,980
So how do we navigate that waters?
And if you're close with those people,

644
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,810
it makes it a lot more difficult.
You know,

645
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:44,110
you have to be the one that really asked
to break those bonds. And sometimes,

646
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,870
you know, it can damage friendships
if you're not careful with that.

647
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,450
And I think I was more
focused on retaining that.

648
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:52,750
So that was on one side of the fence,
the other side of the fence.

649
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:57,100
A lot of times you see individuals that
come into an organization later at a

650
00:40:57,101 --> 00:41:00,030
higher leadership position.
So they get brought in as an officer.

651
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,600
They get brought in as a
leader to a company and
they're mo more focused on that

652
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:08,470
leadership position that they don't
take the time to get to know the people.

653
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:11,860
They're leading a,
so they're too far away from the fence.

654
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,370
It's a chain link fence so that you
can talk through it so that you can

655
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:16,480
communicate through it.

656
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,350
And the best leaders have the ability
to be right up against that fence.

657
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,900
So whether they're on either side,

658
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,190
they're able to turn around and
gained guidance from the individuals,

659
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:31,000
whether it's their leadership and
communicated through to those they lead or

660
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,400
whether they're on the
side of communicating and
interacting with those they

661
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:38,800
lead and communicating through and
getting guidance from who they follow. Um,

662
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:40,510
okay.

663
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:44,020
Problems arise when you're too far away
from the fence. You know, the, the,

664
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:47,080
the leaders who are so far on the
other side of the fence at all they're

665
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:51,040
thinking about is how do I make the next
rank? You know, we know who they are.

666
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:54,730
I mean we've seen those guys who
literally, you know, you think, man,

667
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,200
you would like kill your mother to make
the next rank to be this or be that. Uh,

668
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:01,630
and then we also know those guys who,
you know,

669
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:05,920
they have no aspirations to try and get
better on the other side of the fence.

670
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:09,700
And we, you know, we joke
about the Cori fives, you know,
they're perfectly content,

671
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,940
you know, the magic position in
the seal teams where, you know,

672
00:42:12,941 --> 00:42:17,590
you're at that level where,
um, you're high enough above
to not do the grunt work,

673
00:42:17,591 --> 00:42:22,180
but you don't really have tremendous
responsibilities. I was way too far away.

674
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,320
That was the bottom line and this is
where I was tremendously failing and not

675
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:30,430
setting the example I wasn't
communicating with, uh,

676
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,710
with the leadership I was,

677
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,650
they were trying to provide me guidance
and basically saying, hey dude,

678
00:42:35,651 --> 00:42:36,910
you're screwing things up.

679
00:42:36,911 --> 00:42:41,911
And even even Pete carry
himself was trying to convey
to me in his very abrasive

680
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:47,560
way, hey dude, you know, this is
not the way you do things. Uh,

681
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:52,040
but I was blinded both by
having an excelled, uh,

682
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,840
at this point in my career, really
rocketing up, uh, and thinking, oh,

683
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,850
I know these things. You
know, I'm, I'm the man. Uh,

684
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,760
so humility is such a critical component
of leadership to take that step back.

685
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:05,350
And if anybody's given you advice,

686
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,780
always take a second to think through
it and, and, you know, evaluate, hey,

687
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,390
even if maybe you don't think it applies,

688
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:16,120
there's probably pieces of it that dude,
that's the reality.

689
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,090
Yeah. Always when someone's giving me
critique points, you know, and of course,

690
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:23,130
and it's every single,
I say,

691
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,420
every single person on earth doesn't
like receiving critique. Like,

692
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:31,380
and I always joke about the fact that
even when someone asks for criticism,

693
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,470
when they get it, they still get
mad. Even when I say, Hey, Jay,

694
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:37,560
would you read this thing that I just
wrote and tell me what you think of it?

695
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,840
And then you read it. You say, you
know, I thought it was a little,

696
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,300
you could do this a little bit
better. I'm going to be mad. Right.

697
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:46,590
Everyone gets mad. And so that's,
so what I do is the same thing.

698
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:49,260
I take a step back when somebody
gives me a critique point,

699
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,620
even though I'm completely offended
and I don't agree with them.

700
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:54,990
And I think I'm right because
I'm an egotistical maniac.

701
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,390
I put all that aside and I say,
wait a second,

702
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,780
there's a reason that they're telling me
this. There's gotta be some truth to it.

703
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,251
I liked,

704
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm one of my favorite things about
this book is the fact that it,

705
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,050
it reveals the,
the,

706
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,020
the difficulties that we
have in the seal teams,

707
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,990
which are the same difficulties that I
see all the time. So people think, oh,

708
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:20,340
and you're in the seal teams,
everyone's just perfect. And
you know, this, this, uh,

709
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,330
Pete Carrie would be the perfect mentor
and he'd just be able to come along and,

710
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,910
and then you'd be the perfect recipient,
the perfect mentee, ready to learn.

711
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,800
And everything's just perfect and it,
and it's actually completely untrue.

712
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,010
And what you have in the seal
teams actually in the, in the,

713
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,190
like in the civilian sector and
companies and organizations,

714
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,730
they have these personality,
you know, different
personalities. In the seal teams.

715
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,800
And so you think, oh, in the seal
teams you don't have that. No,

716
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:50,310
you actually have it worse because
you've got these guys that have,

717
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,360
that have really built, their ego's been
built up and we all think we're great.

718
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,800
We all think we're a tactical genius.

719
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:58,130
We all think we don't have
anything to learn. And so,

720
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,060
so we have a lot of issues
around this exact kind of thing.

721
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,100
And it does completely derail not just
leaders, but it derails platoons and I,

722
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,020
I mean we would disband platoons
and when we would dismantle tune,

723
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,790
that means the platoon is
no longer going to exist.

724
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:17,820
We'd have a platoon coming through
training. The platoon would get disbanded.

725
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,110
It doesn't happen very often, but
it happens. And when it happens,

726
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,443
it has,

727
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,110
it has zero to do with the [inaudible]
e fives and usually the Esx is,

728
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:32,670
and it has 100% to do with the senior
aesics is the chiefs and the officer's

729
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:37,080
inside the platoon that just are
disasters. And it does happen.

730
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,220
And I think the fact that you,
the,

731
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,940
the fact that you talk through some of
these issues are, I mean that's what,

732
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,400
that's where it's very revealing about
the seal teams in this book is like, Hey,

733
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,690
we got,
you know,

734
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,520
we got the same issues that they
have an other or any other team,

735
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,410
any other organization
and that, that, you know,

736
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,810
that thing that you talk about this,
this fence, you know, that's, to me,

737
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:02,220
that's the dichotomy of leadership,
right?

738
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:05,040
That's like you can go too far in one
direction or the other and if you go too

739
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:08,460
far in one direction or the other, you're
going to, you're going to fall apart.

740
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,780
Yeah. So check. All right,

741
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,870
now you're on deployment in Afghanistan
and I always, I always mentioned this,

742
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,190
I haven't mentioned it yet,

743
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,870
but I'll mention it right now because
I'm only reading small portions of this

744
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:29,460
book and there so much more great detail
in the book and you'll have a better

745
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:33,060
understanding of these lessons when you,
when you read the whole thing.

746
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:35,520
So if it seems a little bit,
you know,

747
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:37,080
if it seems it's jumping
around a little bit,

748
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,460
it's just because I'm
only reading chunks of,

749
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:43,200
cause I'm not gonna read the whole damn
book. You can read it yourself. All right,

750
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:46,200
so now speaking of jumping around,
you're in Afghanistan,

751
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,560
you had a mission go down where it sounded
like you guys got some bad intel and

752
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,120
it caused a little bit of a problem.

753
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:59,121
You hit the target pretty hard and you
guys got put on an operational pause mean

754
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:02,130
and hey you guys aren't
going to do anything and,

755
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,330
and that's a great story and how that
unfolds is great and people should read so

756
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:09,390
they can learn lessons from that.
But then I'm going to go skip a lesson.

757
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:14,391
Here you are in the Chow Hall and you're
sitting with some of your boys and I'm

758
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:20,220
specifically losing using that term
because at this point you definitely are.

759
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:23,700
We're boys with the boys
and I'm going to the book.

760
00:47:23,701 --> 00:47:27,870
I'd been searching for a way to prove
myself ever since I'd come aboard now the

761
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:30,790
opportunity to do so had
just fallen in my lap.

762
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,790
I had to take it in time.

763
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,420
I learned there was nothing more dangerous
on the battlefield than an immature

764
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,810
and arrogant officer who feels
he needs to prove himself.

765
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:44,920
It can lead men to their death and what
you're looking at is you happen to be

766
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:49,921
sitting in the Chow Hall with the
commanding general and these guys kind of

767
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,960
your, your boys kind of egg you
on to go talk to them about, hey,

768
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:59,740
why are we, why are we standing out
in a year, an ensign at this point?

769
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:06,280
Okay, so here we go. I walked
over and stood beside the
generals table, excuse me,

770
00:48:06,281 --> 00:48:08,950
general,
and it's in Redmond naval special warfare.

771
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,640
Do you have a couple of minutes?
His aides glowered up at me.

772
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:17,200
Stamped on their faces is like,
who the hell are you? Look,

773
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:21,070
that made me momentarily waiver.
The general invited me to sit down.

774
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,170
His aides looked frosted and grew
more so after I began to talk, sorry,

775
00:48:25,171 --> 00:48:27,220
I just wanted to talk to you
about this operational pause.

776
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:28,510
We still seem to be in.

777
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,940
I began the general's face registering
nothing but interest. I continued.

778
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:36,280
I know there was a miscommunication
with our first mission,

779
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,670
but we know the enemies out there and
we'd really like to take the opportunity

780
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:43,820
to go after them. The general heard me
out then replied diplomatically. Well,

781
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,810
Anson, I've got to look at all
the strategic factors here.

782
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,840
We must always weigh the strategic
impact with the impact on the civilian

783
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:53,620
populace and there are implications
to going out and operating at night.

784
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:54,850
I understand that sir,

785
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,990
right now where at a crazy time in the
war and we have to balance what we're

786
00:48:58,991 --> 00:49:03,700
doing. Well, general, I said I can
hardly read that with a straight face.

787
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,110
Well, generally I said we really feel like
we can contribute in a positive way by

788
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:12,530
going after the men who pose a clear and
present threat to coalition forces in

789
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:14,650
general was noncommittal
but remained polite.

790
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,950
I don't think as aids took their eyes
off me through the entire conversation,

791
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:21,700
I could feel them boring holes through me.
I thanked them for their time,

792
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:26,350
got up and headed back to my table.
The other two operators were gone.

793
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,900
Why hadn't they stuck around?

794
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,773
Get some,

795
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,940
yeah. Be aware of a peer pressure
and be where, you know, once again,

796
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:46,720
it comes back to that, that
lead yourself, lead yourself,

797
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:51,680
that founding principle because you know,
this was a dangerous thing. And, and, and,

798
00:49:51,681 --> 00:49:54,790
and I did this several times during
that deployment. You know, this,

799
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:59,791
this misunderstanding or this idea that
somehow there's this shortcut to be an

800
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:04,900
effective leader, that there's this
push button, easy button, that beep,

801
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,930
look at me now. I'm a great leader and
this really was this moment. And I mean,

802
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,830
people understand this was an
interesting time. So this was,

803
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,510
um, this was July of 2005. So,

804
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,673
um,

805
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,960
June 28th of 2005 operation red wings
had just happened and that was our troop.

806
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,410
So we had, um, you know, we
had lost five of our guys,

807
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,620
including our troop commander. Uh,
we had lost my air Christianson.

808
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,690
We had lost my good friend and the
OIC of that platoon, Mike Mcgreevey,

809
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,870
I originally was in echo platoon.
Um,

810
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,320
we had trained alongside
those guys. So, uh,

811
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:49,580
we were all grieving and
we all wanted revenge.

812
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,380
We all wanted to go after the enemy.

813
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,320
So the very first mission
we did was to mission.

814
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:57,740
You talked about that got us
in a little bit of trouble.

815
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:02,950
So now take the dynamics of everybody
grieving because of the loss of our

816
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:06,260
teammates and,

817
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,800
and then doing our first mission and
being put in hack because of really some

818
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,500
outstanding issues that you
can read about in the book.

819
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:19,580
We had actually done everything right
but it kind of got placed back on us.

820
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:24,320
So I just, you know, it's these
moments that as a young leader,

821
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,440
whether you're in a business, whether
you're in the military, law enforcement,

822
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:30,980
whatever you do,
that you see this shortcut,

823
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:35,840
oh look what I can do. And
it got fueled when, you know,

824
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:38,780
my teammates and I sat there and
started talking and you know,

825
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:41,150
teammates where the biggest,
you know,

826
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,560
shit talkers on the planet and uh,
they uh,

827
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,110
they definitely were egging
me on and I ate it up, hook,

828
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,480
line and sinker and I was like,
you are absolutely right.

829
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,370
Here is a great opportunity for me
to, you know, shed some, you know,

830
00:51:55,371 --> 00:52:00,080
amazing wisdom and insight to this general
where he now is going to be like, oh,

831
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:01,700
young ensign.
You're so right.

832
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:05,780
We should absolutely allow you guys to
go out and conduct all these operations

833
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:09,830
because I'm, you know, I'm not smart
enough to allow this to happen. I mean,

834
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:10,250
the air,

835
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:15,250
the arrogance that I had and really
sad that I didn't think through,

836
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:19,490
you know, what are the implications of
this, you know, for you to go do that.

837
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:22,040
I mean, it was just a stupid decision. Uh,

838
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:26,720
and I realized it as soon as those
guys were gone, like all of a sudden,

839
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:29,150
I'm like,
Huh,

840
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,780
what did you just do more on? And, uh,

841
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:39,770
as I walked back from the Chow Hall
to, uh, to our, you know, our camp,

842
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,980
I was like,
this isn't going to go.

843
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,810
He went and told your boss
that you did it right. I did.

844
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:47,570
I went straight back to my CEO and I said,
Hey,

845
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:51,950
I want to let you know what just happened.
I said, I thought it was good idea.

846
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,110
Um, and, uh, I don't think it was,

847
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,460
and you know, it was funny, he kind
of looked at me and he said, why, why,

848
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:05,690
why did you think that
was a good idea? And, uh,

849
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,120
and I said, well, I was, you know, I
didn't, I was doing it for the boys.

850
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:14,240
It was about the boys and you know,
so it really was,

851
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,860
and at the end of the day it was
about me. And that's where, you know,

852
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,700
really understanding that,
you know, in leadership,

853
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,980
you are the last point in the equation.
And

854
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,060
don't get me wrong,
you know,

855
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,750
there's an overlap of everything
that happens that we do.

856
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,840
So oftentimes you're focused on the
mission. You're focused on the man.

857
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:36,780
And of course by doing that, well,
there is a positive impact for you.

858
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:40,980
And there's nothing wrong with that.
But that thought process, it should be,

859
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:46,770
it should be by sequence, if you will, not
because you're focused on it, you know,

860
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:48,390
100% and you're right,

861
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,660
the biproduct of focusing on your
people and focusing on your mission,

862
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:55,920
the byproduct of that is you will
be successful. And the contrary,

863
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,950
the contrary in situation is literally
if you focus on yourself instead of your

864
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:04,560
people and your mission,
you will fail you, will you.

865
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:08,790
And you know what fails a strong word
because there's people in you and I know

866
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:12,340
him who have focused on
themselves and they, they, they,

867
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,830
they can win this battle and they
can win this tactical bound. They,

868
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,370
when this tactical battle and
they can get to a certain point,

869
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:20,160
but eventually it will come back on them.

870
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,210
And you won't be truly
successful as if you would,

871
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,330
as you would have been had
you focused on the men,

872
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,150
the mission and not focused on yourself.

873
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,110
I call those people leadership
wrecking balls too. They're good at,

874
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,890
they're good at what they do. Um,
you know, in some ways peak carriers,

875
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:42,360
one of those people, he was very good at
what he did and he got things done. Uh,

876
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,370
but he had a tendency to leave.

877
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:48,900
And a lot of organizations have these
individuals and they keep them around

878
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:50,220
because they do get things done,

879
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,590
but they leave a path of
destruction behind them.

880
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:56,190
And over time people don't want
to work with them and you know,

881
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:59,250
that's why I call him the leadership
wrecking ball. So you know,

882
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:02,040
I tell people you need to evaluate
yourself. Are you one of those people?

883
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:05,340
Do you turn around? You know, forward.
You look at the successes that you have,

884
00:55:05,341 --> 00:55:08,370
but you turn around and look and there's
a path of destruction in a way there.

885
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,220
No doubt about it.
All right,

886
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:15,470
so you've guys eventually do get
back in the game. You, you the,

887
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,440
the pause,

888
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:21,441
operational pause gets lifted and you
guys are operating again and here you are

889
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,890
out on an operation. You're in an
Overwatch position on a hilltop.

890
00:55:25,891 --> 00:55:28,410
Going back to the book
between burst of gunfire,

891
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:31,020
I heard him report troops in
contact troops in contact.

892
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,460
We're facing at least 20 enemy fighters,
a wash of static followed.

893
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:39,570
Then I heard joker add.
One of our Afghan soldiers is wounded.

894
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,070
We need reinforcements.
Jay, here's your chance.

895
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,130
Your teammates are in trouble.
I looked down into the valley.

896
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,680
Thousand feet below the slope was steep,

897
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:52,290
perhaps 60 degrees in places getting down.

898
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,750
There would be a serious
climb once at the bottom.

899
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,860
We'd have to maneuver to the sound of
the guns through broken terrain and

900
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:02,850
vegetation that would
complicate approaching our
guys without getting shot by

901
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:03,684
accident.

902
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:08,250
I called the Fred and asked if the
western Overwatch team was still in place.

903
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,110
Gunfire erupted over the radio as he
keyed. Is Mike and answered? I think so.

904
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,940
Okay, good. That gave us eyes above and
control of the high ground over there.

905
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,300
This is the moment Jay,
go prove yourself.

906
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,500
As we dropped off the lip,

907
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:28,300
senior chief Carey called to me over
the radio and wanted to know what I was

908
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,230
doing. We're going down. I
told him he went ballistic.

909
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,040
Absolutely not. We need to
link back up, fall back.

910
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:41,800
The boys needed help and we were closest.
If it had been anybody else,

911
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:43,960
I might have thought twice about his call,

912
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,700
but my own personal quest to prove myself
coupled with my intense hatred for him

913
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,170
clouded my judgment.

914
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,170
I ignored him and we pressed on.
As we dropped further into the valley,

915
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,440
we lost all communication
with the headquarters team.

916
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:03,760
I began to realize what a hairy situation
I had just placed the two of us in.

917
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,390
We had given up the high ground to move
down a thousand feet of vertical terrain

918
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:11,590
to try and link up with an element under
fire with an enemy force almost one

919
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:16,510
kilometer away. I pushed this thought to
the back of my mind. The boys need help.

920
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,300
Focus on that,
but where was the fight?

921
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,290
The sounds of battle echoed all across
the valley making it difficult to

922
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,180
calculate distance and direction.

923
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,800
A broken transmission filled my earpiece.
I couldn't tell what it was,

924
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:32,080
but I recognize Jay ds voice.

925
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,790
I tried to establish contact a moment
later through washes of static jds voice

926
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:39,910
came back. Where the hell
are you, Jay d demanded.

927
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,840
I told him we were at the t
intersection on the valley floor.

928
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,490
Get your ass out of the valley.

929
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:49,630
Now he said with so much anger I could
almost feel a blast of fire shoot out of

930
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:52,960
the earpiece. I was about to
explain my intent when he added.

931
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:57,340
Those guys are in a major fight and we
can't call and close air support because

932
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:02,080
we don't know where you are.
That shook me.

933
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,160
There were aircraft overhead waiting to
join the battle with rockets and bombs,

934
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,270
yet they could not make their runs because
of my decision to go into the valley.

935
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:15,700
I should have thought about our air
assets, but I was too blinded by a,

936
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:19,960
my own ambition with my Kombat
IX inexperience on full display.

937
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,440
It started to dawn on me at
last had I made a mistake.

938
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:26,110
What if somebody got hit
during the delay I'd caused,

939
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:29,800
I keyed my radio and reported that we
would be pulling out of the valley and

940
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:32,980
climbing up the north face of the t
intersection to link up with our element

941
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:33,814
there.

942
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:38,890
Once we were consolidated on the North
Ridge and our security was set for what

943
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,420
was surely be a long night ahead,

944
00:58:40,421 --> 00:58:44,410
JD came looking for me as he approached.

945
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:48,280
I could see he was livid.
What the hell were you doing and dignity.

946
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:50,830
I told him I was trying to
go to the aid of my brothers.

947
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,070
He looked at me like I
just spit on his wife.

948
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,210
That was a stupid thing you did read.
You could have gotten people killed.

949
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:03,820
His words made me even more righteously
indignant. I fired back at him.

950
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,920
The boys were in trouble
and I went to their aid.

951
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,080
I did what I needed to
be done in the moment.

952
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,880
Jay d refuse to accept that I tossed
out a similar situation that occurred in

953
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:15,630
Afghanistan a few years
before as if establish,

954
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,430
establishing precedents
would help my case.

955
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:22,400
Jay Dee knew the mission too and he cut
me off with not the same at all. Red.

956
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:26,840
They didn't have air support available.
I didn't know. I know we ditch.

957
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,960
I shouted back.
You delayed it with what you did.

958
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,330
Jd roared at last what?

959
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:35,090
It was clear to j d that his
words were not sinking in.

960
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:38,240
He ended the argument currently said,
we'll deal this when we,

961
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:42,320
after when we get back to Kandahar,
you turned in, stalked off.

962
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,980
I watched him leave and
struggled with my own thoughts.

963
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,090
Had I really made that big of a
mistake. No, no way. I went to help.

964
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,040
When is that ever wrong

965
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,490
bro?
That's a rough,

966
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:04,561
you know,

967
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:09,510
a lot of people read that section who
don't have a tactical background and they

968
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:13,740
don't fully understand. They're
like, Oh man, no, you did
the heroic thing. You know,

969
01:00:13,741 --> 01:00:15,300
you went down into the
battle and you know,

970
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:17,900
you tried to take the fight to the enemy.
But you know,

971
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,150
I tried to explain to them, you know,
you don't have a tactical understanding.

972
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:25,170
You know, there are so many things
that were done wrong there. Um,

973
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:26,900
okay.

974
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,490
That it literally,

975
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:32,030
and this story would be so different if
something had actually happen and the

976
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,090
potential for something to have gone
wrong is through the roof. I mean,

977
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:37,250
you've been in Afghanistan,
I mean, you know,

978
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:42,690
the fighting positions and basically I
took myself off a very advantageous high

979
01:00:42,691 --> 01:00:47,510
ground position that we owned down into
the valley a thousand feet below. I mean,

980
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:51,170
there could have been hundreds of fighting
positions in caves above me that any

981
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,320
one single fighter could
have just decimated us.

982
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:57,170
And it would have been one
thing if I got myself killed,

983
01:00:57,171 --> 01:01:01,370
but I pulled a young team guy,
machine gunner down with me.

984
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:05,770
So I placed this guy's life
in jeopardy. And you know, I,

985
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,580
the funny thing is,
you know,

986
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:11,750
I tried to paint it in that moment
arguing with JD that I was doing the right

987
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,610
thing.
I'm taking the fight to the enemy.

988
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:17,240
I'm supporting my brothers
and all this bs. You know,

989
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:21,670
the reality was I wanted to get
in the fight at that point, uh,

990
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:25,700
I had been on the edge of a lot
of firefights and, and you know,

991
01:01:25,701 --> 01:01:28,910
and even inviting them and
until you get in there,

992
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,470
you haven't proved yourself.
And I wanted to prove myself.

993
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:38,210
I wanted to prove myself both as a seal,
as a fighter and as a leader.

994
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:43,100
And this was another moment,
just like the general where I thought,

995
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:46,360
here's my opportunity.
And um,

996
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,650
and I was so unwilling to listen.

997
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,680
Um, you know, that I had made a mistake.

998
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:57,260
And the reality is if I had
owned it in that moment,

999
01:01:57,261 --> 01:02:00,230
it probably would not have
been as bad as it was.

1000
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:05,330
But the mere fact that I just planted
my flag on that spot and was like,

1001
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:09,410
screw you, you're wrong. I'm
right. And I did the right thing,

1002
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:14,650
I think just turned what was
a fire into a raging inferno.

1003
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,640
Yeah, yeah. No, that's,
that's rough. And I think also

1004
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,090
from a, from a tactical perspective,
people make mistakes like this.

1005
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:29,670
Like it can happen and it can
happen. And, and you know,

1006
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:33,570
I talk about being able to detach and
that's something that I definitely learned

1007
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:34,620
in the seal teams.
And it was,

1008
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:40,100
I think one of the most
advantageous skills for a leader,

1009
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,810
especially a combat leader to have,
is to be able to,

1010
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:46,140
to step back from the
situation as it's unfolding.

1011
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,430
Because if you fully knew,
hey,

1012
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:54,960
we've got air overhead and they're in
a firefight and if I go down there,

1013
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:59,010
we won't be able to use air support.
You wouldn't have done this.

1014
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,050
Even even, uh, 60 gunner, you know,
even a pig gunner would say, oh, okay,

1015
01:03:04,051 --> 01:03:07,440
no, I need to, I need to let
that unfold. But you know,

1016
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:10,050
your excitement to get down there and,

1017
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:14,640
and get in the fight is definitely,
that's something that,

1018
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:19,510
that can grab a hold of, of anyone
if they're not careful. And,

1019
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:22,860
and again, it's what we just talked
about with you at that moment.

1020
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:27,210
Put yourself ahead of the
mission ahead of the team and,

1021
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:32,040
and then, yeah, I mean this idea of
ownership and, and you know, when I,

1022
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:35,280
when I kick off, uh, the book that I
wrote with lay for extreme ownership,

1023
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:39,680
you know, it kicks off with a blue
on blue and you know, it was a,

1024
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:43,260
it was a lot of bad things happening.
There was a lot of moving parts going on.

1025
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,960
It was a horrible situation to
an Iraqi soldier got killed,

1026
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:48,000
several more got wounded.
One of my guys got wounded.

1027
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,270
And I can tell you right now,

1028
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:55,050
like I think if I would have
said, hey, this wasn't my fault,

1029
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:56,620
blame it on someone else. I, I,

1030
01:03:56,830 --> 01:04:00,570
I think I would've gotten fired
about in about three seconds. Um,

1031
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,370
because it's just a,
it's a bad situation to unfold and yeah,

1032
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:09,530
you planting the flag on
that is, is rough. And,

1033
01:04:09,531 --> 01:04:10,740
and I mean,

1034
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:15,810
your humility and putting this out there
is awesome and people can learn so much

1035
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:20,610
from that because if you
recognize how easily you and
you know, okay, let's, let's,

1036
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:23,190
let's, let's paint you in a bad light
that you were young and you were,

1037
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,380
but let's paint you in a good light.
Even with,

1038
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:28,160
you had those qualities of being hyper
aggressive and you wanted to get in the

1039
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:30,390
fight and you would a little bit arrogant.

1040
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,210
You're still a team guy that's
trying to do a good job.

1041
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:36,960
It wasn't like we were trying to do
a bad job, so to recognize like, hey,

1042
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:41,130
even if you're well intentioned, if you
don't pay attention to these things,

1043
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,700
they can grab a hold of you and they can
pull you in the wrong direction. And,

1044
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:49,220
and you look up and, and you're,
you're, you're planting your flag and,

1045
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,070
and putting up your defenses
around an indefensible position,

1046
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:58,500
which is where you ended up here. And
you nailed it with the idea, you know,

1047
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:01,470
it's something I know you talk to people
about a business and I talk about it.

1048
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:04,800
I think it's no different
probably in fighting. You know,

1049
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:06,360
you've got to let the
battlefield developed.

1050
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:11,310
Sometimes we have this natural instinct
that when something bad happens,

1051
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:14,310
when a crisis happens, we feel
this, you know, oh my God,

1052
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:17,800
I got to react immediately
before we actually take time.

1053
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,510
And even in a gunfight you typically
have a few seconds and it's amazing how

1054
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:27,100
much information we can process in a
few seconds before we react and move.

1055
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,520
And so that was one problem.

1056
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,460
And the other problem and you know,

1057
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,230
was I was driven by this relationship,

1058
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:42,610
um, issue. And it's funny,
you know, the individual, uh,

1059
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:47,240
the retire mass chief that you
were with on Thursday who was, uh,

1060
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,110
I served under him twice later.

1061
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:54,880
We had talked about that exact situation
and he had given me advice later and he

1062
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:58,240
said, never let your personal feelings
get in the way of your professional

1063
01:05:58,241 --> 01:06:02,800
relationships. And I had, I had absolutely
let my personal feelings drive that.

1064
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:06,940
And that was probably the biggest f
you moment, you know, like I said,

1065
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:08,050
if it had been anybody else,

1066
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:12,090
but my hatred for him had grown to
the point that I was just like, yell,

1067
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:16,330
let me show you buddy. You know? And so
all these things, you know, dangerous,

1068
01:06:16,331 --> 01:06:20,920
you know, that not only did you know all
these things you have to be careful of.

1069
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,500
I mean, this is what
falls under, you know,

1070
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,950
a lot of people call these different
things. And my pen Ogana peak performance,

1071
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:28,420
I call it emotional leadership.

1072
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:31,330
So your ability to detach yourself
for a second and say, okay,

1073
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:34,960
I'm not going to let my
own personal feelings drive
this because what's going on

1074
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:35,441
around me,

1075
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:39,460
my ability to lead and make the right
decisions is more critical than what I

1076
01:06:39,461 --> 01:06:43,030
feel. And, uh, obviously, you know,

1077
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:47,170
I have not learned those lessons yet.
I was on that, uh, on that glide path.

1078
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:51,310
And at this point I was on the glide path
down. I was crashing and burning ruff,

1079
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,700
ruff. Uh, going back to
the book back at Kandahar,

1080
01:06:54,701 --> 01:06:56,080
I heard the first whiskey whispers

1081
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,670
about me floating around the team.
The men had nicknamed me Rambo read.

1082
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,220
Though some may think being
compared to Stallone's,

1083
01:07:03,221 --> 01:07:07,120
Lone Wolf silver screen icon was
a compliment within our community.

1084
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:11,890
It was a supreme insult in the seal teams.
There's no room for individualism.

1085
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:17,140
The foundations of our success rest on
mutual cooperation and communication.

1086
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:22,370
A lone wolf like Rambo could destroy a
team with catastrophic effects on the

1087
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:26,500
battlefield.
After we debrief the mission,

1088
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:30,250
JD Richardson took me into
his makeshift office and said,

1089
01:07:30,251 --> 01:07:33,040
read your operational abilities
had been called into question.

1090
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,950
We're sending you back to [inaudible]
to meet with the CEO and we'll discuss

1091
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:40,000
this further when the rest of the
team gets back. I was stunned.

1092
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,650
At worst, I was starting to expect
something more than a wrist slap,

1093
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,060
but nothing like that.

1094
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,020
I was being sent back to
the rear out of combat.

1095
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,740
Nothing can ever be more
humiliating for a warrior.

1096
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:58,840
I trained my entire adult life for this
and now I had been told I didn't measure

1097
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:02,560
up.
I felt like a mule kick to the gut.

1098
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:08,740
I heard rumblings that senior chief
Kerry wanted to see my trident taken away

1099
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:10,450
behind the scenes.

1100
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:14,080
He was pushing for a Trident
Review Board to determine my fate.

1101
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:19,340
The months of infighting between us had
been bad enough now he was trying to

1102
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:21,110
destroy my career.

1103
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:30,450
I was sick at the thought of losing my
tried and over a single bad moment in a

1104
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:34,170
valley whose name nobody back home would
ever know and whose vocation would not

1105
01:08:34,171 --> 01:08:35,040
matter to anyone,

1106
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:40,041
but a handful of men who had fought in
it and it's in Redmond had demonstrated a

1107
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:42,750
consistent pattern of bad decision making.

1108
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,040
I thought again about my screaming match
with senior chief Kerry during the NATO

1109
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:48,690
exercise.
When it ended,

1110
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:53,100
what did I see in the eyes of what
did I see in the eyes of my teammates?

1111
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:58,320
Embarrassment. This wasn't really
about one moment in the valley,

1112
01:08:58,321 --> 01:09:01,230
was it Jay?
I had to face that fact.

1113
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,420
I rubbed my anchoring temples.

1114
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,990
I felt like my head was going to explode
from the pressure building inside of it.

1115
01:09:06,991 --> 01:09:10,560
My life was being destroyed and I had
made myself vulnerable to these attacks

1116
01:09:10,561 --> 01:09:15,561
with my own actions if I was allowed
to continue to operate stories of this

1117
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:17,760
deployment,
which circulate through the teams.

1118
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,060
If I go to my next platoon
with my reputation in tatters,

1119
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,500
who would follow my lead

1120
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,560
sitting neatly on the wooden
crossbar on the floor beside my bed,

1121
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,840
my holstered Sig Sauer p two two
six sat well oiled and cleaned.

1122
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,260
I leaned over and pulled it out.

1123
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,380
I knew around was already in the chamber,

1124
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:47,890
but I drew back the slide and took a
look to make sure we called a suppress

1125
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:52,200
check and it confirmed what I
already knew my gun was ready to go.

1126
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:58,120
As I held the pistol, I thought
of the Great Samurai warriors who,

1127
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:01,030
if disgraced,
would commit ritual suicide.

1128
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:07,080
Part of me willed my hand to raise the
SIG to press it firmly to my temple.

1129
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,413
Yeah,

1130
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:13,430
my life is over. There's nothing
left but an honorable exit.

1131
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,380
I glanced over at the desk and saw a
picture of my beautiful wife, Erica.

1132
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:23,600
The image of her face riveted my
attention. Her easy going smile, her eyes,

1133
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:28,220
a light and lively, always quick to
laugh or offer love and compassion.

1134
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,470
What would this do to her? After
all, she'd sacrificed for me.

1135
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:38,650
Would my death snuff out the life of her
gorgeous eyes with a bullet I put in my

1136
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:40,850
temple,

1137
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:45,850
I'd leave her the burden of my failed
career and a ticket to a lifetime of

1138
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:50,420
grief. The kids would live
under that cloud as well.

1139
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,210
You know, it's interesting,
a lot of people, um,

1140
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,510
who have not read my book or maybe they
have read it and they gloss over this,

1141
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,450
but they will

1142
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:18,140
wrongly assume that my injuries and that
ambush and the aftermath of that ambush

1143
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:23,190
where the hardest thing I've
ever been through and a,

1144
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:27,900
and I tell them absolutely
not. Um, by far that,

1145
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:32,640
that moment right there in that
period of time in my life about a, uh,

1146
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:35,930
that was about a four month
period, maybe five months, that,

1147
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
that journey to the bottom and I was
almost at rock bottom at that point.

1148
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,740
And this is where

1149
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:53,250
the psychology of humans is an
interesting thing because, um,

1150
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:58,230
all of us have that little voice
that lives inside of us. A,

1151
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:02,950
I call mine my demon and
my demon has been, uh,

1152
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,950
my greatest pusher because
he tells me what I can't do.

1153
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,570
And he also at times can be,
uh,

1154
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:14,430
the most dangerous thing out there because
they will push you to do things that

1155
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,760
are wrong. They will push you to do
things and tell you you can't do things.

1156
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,530
And it was in that moment that I
literally was listening to that,

1157
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:26,670
that you know, you will never recover
and you, you know, your career is over.

1158
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:29,550
There's no way you're going
to come back from this, uh,

1159
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,970
the guys who are never going to
follow you again. All these lies,

1160
01:12:32,971 --> 01:12:36,960
these are lies that we tell ourselves.
And I think it's really important.

1161
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:41,370
You know, if there's anything
about me, I tell people that I am,

1162
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,750
I am an expert on overcoming adversity,
failure and crisis.

1163
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,130
And it doesn't matter how bad things
have been, you always can recover.

1164
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:52,350
It goes back to those
three rules of leadership.

1165
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:55,140
You just once again go
back to leading yourself.

1166
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:58,590
And in that moment though,
I was so

1167
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,220
crushed,
uh,

1168
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,010
so crushed because I had convinced myself
that I had done the right thing. And,

1169
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:11,040
and unfortunately I still believe that
and I just saw myself as a victim,

1170
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,510
a victim who had no way that I could
recover. And, you know, it's sad and,

1171
01:13:15,511 --> 01:13:19,740
and you know,
God moment that I glanced over,

1172
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:23,340
cause I don't think if, if I had
made the mistake or wherever I was,

1173
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:26,160
him not having pictures of
my wife and kids right there,

1174
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:30,120
I probably would have done it.
Uh, cause I just felt so hopeless.

1175
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,910
And then I was ashamed,
um,

1176
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,410
honestly for thinking that and thinking
about the impact I would leave on them.

1177
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:42,420
So I'd love to say that was the catalyst
of starting to climb out of that hole.

1178
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:46,890
But I actually continued to spiral down
over the next couple of months, uh,

1179
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,680
until finally, you know, my, you know,

1180
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:52,950
that moment occurred right after,
you know,

1181
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:55,260
my judgment had been set upon me,

1182
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,180
which really I was very fortunate because
I should have been grateful because

1183
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,590
really what they could have done is
said, you're outta here. You know,

1184
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:03,990
we're sending you out of the teams,

1185
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:06,660
you're going to go before try to review
board. And they didn't, you know,

1186
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:10,170
the CEO believed in me. He said, you
know, you've done a lot of great things.

1187
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:13,780
You've had some amazing moments.
You've just, you've got some flaws,

1188
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,640
you've got some arrogant
flaws and you definitely,

1189
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:21,550
we need to work on your decision making,
um,

1190
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:28,600
leadership abilities. So that's
what they did. It's, it's a,

1191
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:33,330
you know, when, when I was
reading this part, it's,

1192
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:36,380
it's gonna be, it's, it's, I don't
know, I don't think you could have,

1193
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,900
I don't think a human being,
I don't think you could explain.

1194
01:14:38,901 --> 01:14:43,901
I don't think we'll Shakespeare could
explain to someone that's not in the teams

1195
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:51,010
what it feels like to be in the teams and
to feel like maybe that's not going to

1196
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:56,300
be your life anymore.
That's rough man.

1197
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:59,420
And I don't think he,
I mean you did your best and like I said,

1198
01:14:59,421 --> 01:15:04,040
I don't think it's just too to explain
and I mean I guess you do it because you

1199
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:04,910
explain,
listen,

1200
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:09,970
you were at a point where if you couldn't
be in the teams you didn't want to be

1201
01:15:10,281 --> 01:15:13,880
alive. That's where you were at right
there. And I guess that does explain it.

1202
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,760
I think it might be hard
for people to relate to,

1203
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:19,190
but like for people like you and me,

1204
01:15:19,191 --> 01:15:23,840
that grew up literally whole
adult life in the seal teams.

1205
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:28,420
I can't even imagine if
at the, in the, in the,

1206
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:33,100
in the highlight of that moment
of being deployed in combat,

1207
01:15:33,101 --> 01:15:34,300
you just lost your,

1208
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:38,620
your comrades in arms from your
task unit and to be told, okay,

1209
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:43,600
you can't do this job anymore. I
mean, like you said, and again,

1210
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:47,770
I think it's going to be hard for people
to understand that it seems like you,

1211
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:50,350
you would never want to,
you wouldn't want to live at all.

1212
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:54,230
And then just to add this onto
what you're saying, and I,

1213
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,010
and I say this every time that I talk
about these kinds of personal, uh,

1214
01:15:59,011 --> 01:16:01,120
storms that people get into,

1215
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,160
and I've just got to say this in case
someone hasn't heard me say it before.

1216
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,930
When you're in that storm,

1217
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,740
it seems like it's goes
forever in every direction.

1218
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,510
Anyone on the outside would anyone 10
feet away from you would look at you and

1219
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,370
say, Oh yeah, you're, you, you
made some mistakes. You need to,

1220
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,560
you need to get back on the horse
and need to get back out there.

1221
01:16:20,561 --> 01:16:22,630
Here's what's going to help you get fixed.
Here's what gets you back on.

1222
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,020
But when we're it,
we,

1223
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:28,240
every direction you look is black
and you think you're not getting out.

1224
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:33,020
And team guys don't play around either
at all. Going back to the book. I,

1225
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:35,830
so you decide, okay, I'm going
to, I'm going to stick it out.

1226
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:39,400
You're on your way back.
I made my way my way back to my hooch.

1227
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,320
When I entered our living quarters,

1228
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:45,250
I walked by our message board and
saw notes scrawled next to my name.

1229
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,910
Why don't you go ahead and kill yourself?

1230
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,710
Yeah.

1231
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:53,890
I stared at the words for, I don't
know how long the hallway was empty.

1232
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,770
Nobody had been standing around
waiting to see my reaction.

1233
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,143
Okay,

1234
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:02,870
that's team guys.
There's no mercy in a seal platoon,

1235
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:07,190
not, you know, I've often thought
about that and, and you know the deal,

1236
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:09,230
we have incredibly dark humor.

1237
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:14,630
So I often wonder with somebody just
trying to lighten the mood and kind of

1238
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:19,040
shock me into, hey dude, come out
of it. You know, go fix yourself.

1239
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:24,140
Uh, I've always, I've often wondered that
or were they serious? And just like, dude,

1240
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:26,930
you're a disgrace. Yeah, we
don't. And, and I know for a fact,

1241
01:17:26,931 --> 01:17:31,220
I mean there was a point, uh, right
before we left on that deployment, um,

1242
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,390
a couple of weeks later where guys were
being divvied up into where they were

1243
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:39,980
going next. So next platoon and its next
leadership and they were asked, you know,

1244
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:44,180
who, who do you want to work with? You
know, who do you want to work under? And,

1245
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:49,040
and uh, they unequivocally wrote,
we don't want to work with bread.

1246
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:53,900
Uh, so this was an additional blow that
really kind of reinforced, hey man, you,

1247
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:58,250
you, you, you got some, uh,
you got some work to do.

1248
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,370
Except I'll be honest, I wasn't at
that point yet. You weren't there yet.

1249
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:04,070
I was still at rock bottom. You
know, you talk about the storms.

1250
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:09,380
I talk about life and bushes and
this was a major life ambush,

1251
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:12,920
one of the first major life
ambushes I'd ever encountered.

1252
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,740
And I literally was on the x taking,

1253
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:18,860
withering fire and uh,

1254
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:21,350
I couldn't figure out
how to get out of it.

1255
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:26,180
And you were doing your best and return
fire with your pistol? Yes. In this case,

1256
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:29,360
I was going to return in one round
thinking that was going to fix things.

1257
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,160
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm right,

1258
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:35,510
I'm going to maintain this position
right here and I'm going to win. No,

1259
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:39,710
actually you're not. You need to, you
need to look around. You need to maneuver.

1260
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:44,930
So you do end up keeping your tried it
because obviously there were some guys

1261
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,400
that believed in,
like you said,

1262
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:50,360
believed in you and saw
that you had the potential.

1263
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:55,370
And actually sometimes people ask me what
makes a guy get fired or not get fired.

1264
01:18:55,610 --> 01:19:00,610
And for me it's like almost a hundred
percent if the guy lacks humility,

1265
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:04,790
they're going to get fired. Or
if they, if they, if no one,

1266
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:08,630
if I would see a guy that had no humility
whatsoever and I didn't see a crack,

1267
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,610
it'd be like,
okay this guy's a lost cost.

1268
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:11,600
Cause he's never going
to listen to anyone.

1269
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,140
You can't coach someone that
lacks humility completely so,

1270
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,680
or you can't help them.
They,

1271
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:19,160
they're going to sit in on
the acts and just get shot up.

1272
01:19:19,161 --> 01:19:22,820
That's the way it's going to be.
A, so somebody saw that, hey,

1273
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:25,310
we can get through to this guy.
You know, he's a good team guy.

1274
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,140
And more importantly to that point,

1275
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:30,020
and this is a great leadership
point in organizational point,

1276
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:34,130
not only are they going to sit there and
take those hits because there are too

1277
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:35,960
arrogant to be willing to move.

1278
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,360
They're going to pull
everybody else down with them.

1279
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:40,190
And that's where it gets really dangerous.
I mean,

1280
01:19:40,191 --> 01:19:43,400
especially in our community where
lives are on the line. I mean,

1281
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:46,640
if they're unwilling to learn
or humble themselves enough,

1282
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:47,960
they're going to get somebody else killed.

1283
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:50,690
And that was the big concern
at that point. And Man,

1284
01:19:50,691 --> 01:19:55,190
I've got to give Kudos to my commanding
officer who is a friend to this day.

1285
01:19:55,550 --> 01:20:00,350
He saved my career because I wasn't
exhibiting humility. I was fighting back.

1286
01:20:00,351 --> 01:20:03,020
I was, I did the right thing.
I'm the victim here, you know,

1287
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:07,980
I'm just being thrown under the bus.
And thankfully he had enough

1288
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,420
faith in me. I guess he had seen enough
good that he said, I think we can fix him.

1289
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,390
Yup. Good man. Uh,

1290
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:20,130
and one of the things that they do to
fix you in the seal teams is send you to

1291
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:24,030
ranger school. I wonderful. Very
curious from Fort Benning, Georgia.

1292
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:26,670
And I would say there's a small,
there's,

1293
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:28,560
there's some people that go to ranger
school cause they want to go to ranger

1294
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:33,150
school right on. But oftentimes
in the seal teams, ranger school,

1295
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:36,060
and I wouldn't even call it punishment,
but it's,

1296
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:41,900
it's like a reeducation and that's
definitely something that has always been,

1297
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:45,060
and that's what they do with
you. Okay. They're going to,

1298
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:48,960
they're going to send you to a really
tough training school where it's not just

1299
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:51,450
a tough training school where you get
weeded out, you learned some tactics,

1300
01:20:51,451 --> 01:20:55,880
you learn to, you learn leadership. And
I did not go to ranger school, but uh,

1301
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,030
you know,
it's a great school.

1302
01:20:57,031 --> 01:20:59,340
Everyone that I know that the
rangers that I know are awesome guys,

1303
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:04,260
so great school, but oftentimes
we use it in the seal teams.

1304
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:08,700
Maybe punishment is the wrong word.
In some cases I know it's been punishment.

1305
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:12,720
Occasionally a guy will want to go there.
But generally guys,

1306
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:15,900
I mean generally guys are working so
they're not going to go to ranger school.

1307
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:20,670
You end up getting the ranger
school and here we go. Sick, hungry,

1308
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:22,830
burning with resentment
because as you said,

1309
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:26,370
you're not at this point you're still
like all this is this, this is crap.

1310
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,710
I don't deserve this.
Yeah.

1311
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:33,760
I W I was to say I was bitter
is an understatement. She uh,

1312
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:34,740
uh,

1313
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:39,000
burning with resentment I went into the
first few days with without my heart or

1314
01:21:39,001 --> 01:21:42,060
mind engaged. The first week of ranger
school is nothing but a gut check.

1315
01:21:42,061 --> 01:21:44,970
Long days with minimal sleep exposure to
the elements and constant physical and

1316
01:21:44,971 --> 01:21:49,230
mental evolutions to get those who
don't want to be there to quit teamwork

1317
01:21:49,231 --> 01:21:52,890
leadership within a circle of peers
and decision making under stressful

1318
01:21:52,891 --> 01:21:55,620
conditions where the objective
of this first phase as a seal,

1319
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:59,040
I should have represented my community
in the best possible manner while by

1320
01:21:59,041 --> 01:21:59,940
displaying leadership,

1321
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:03,360
a commitment to teamwork and a willingness
to overcome obstacles. Instead,

1322
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:05,820
my action showed me to be arrogant,
ill tempered,

1323
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:07,230
and unwilling to work with others.

1324
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:10,860
Many soldiers falsely believe that
seals are like that in my actions.

1325
01:22:10,861 --> 01:22:12,360
Re simply reinforced it.

1326
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:17,690
I failed to represent my community
as anything but that stereotype.

1327
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,140
So you have this bad attitude.
You go out on a compass course,

1328
01:22:22,141 --> 01:22:24,960
you're pretty good at land nab.
You think you're going to kick ass.

1329
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:28,650
You don't kick ass. You do
a bad job. The black hats.

1330
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:30,630
Who were the ranger instructors?
Here we go.

1331
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:34,140
The black hats chuckled with laughter.
Damn squid got lost.

1332
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,740
We should have given you a boat.
Swaby another growled. Not Surprising.

1333
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:41,190
Seals don't know how to navigate any ways.
I failed at something.

1334
01:22:41,191 --> 01:22:44,430
I once took great pride in not
so good without your Gucci gear.

1335
01:22:44,431 --> 01:22:49,431
Are you another sneered I lost it all
my pent up fury frothed out of me.

1336
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:52,410
Screw this course and screw you.
Kiss my ass.

1337
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,340
I walked up to my company instructor
and told them, I'm out of here. I quit.

1338
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,280
Are you sure you want to do that
without thinking? I said yes.

1339
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:08,860
All. I was reading this
book and I was like, Dang.

1340
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,330
I was thinking, damn, I been wholly

1341
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:18,580
shit. Yeah. Talk about a total
breakdown of emotional leadership.

1342
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:23,020
I mean that's the reality. I had died and
the, and here's the problem with that.

1343
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:27,790
I allowed this to happen
by not managing myself.

1344
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:29,290
I had allowed this,

1345
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:34,350
I was like a pressure cooker waiting to
pop off and instead of managing it and

1346
01:23:37,121 --> 01:23:40,390
recognize it and come to
grips with it, I did. And it,

1347
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:45,420
it just manifested itself in that moment
where I failed the Land Nav course,

1348
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,260
uh, because of my own
arrogance. And then, you know,

1349
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:53,680
I allowed those ranger instructors to
get under my skin in that failure instead

1350
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:55,390
of immediately saying,
well, hey, no big deal.

1351
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:59,650
I could have gone back and done it again
like three days later because I wasn't

1352
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:03,550
the only guy in that failed. There were
other guys that feel, but instead of that,

1353
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,770
I instantly just,

1354
01:24:05,771 --> 01:24:09,310
it was one additional
blow that I had sustained.

1355
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,740
And being at this tipping point,
you know,

1356
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:16,060
I allowed them to get under my skin and
snapped and it is the only thing I have

1357
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:19,300
ever quit in my life that I
have verbally quit. I mean,

1358
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:20,590
for all intents and purposes,

1359
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:25,591
I rang the bell in that moment and so
angry and frustrated and listened to that

1360
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:31,360
demon that said, your career is over. You
will never recover from this. You know,

1361
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:35,410
this is the final Straw. You know, you
had an opportunity and you missed it, man.

1362
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:36,460
So you know,

1363
01:24:36,461 --> 01:24:40,480
nobody's ever going to follow you again
and everyone's screwed you over and put

1364
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:45,460
you in this point. Absolutely.
That's why, you know, victim,
victim, victim mentality.

1365
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:50,560
Now this is a miracle.
This is the miracle.

1366
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:54,290
Big As god moment that
people don't understand this.

1367
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,500
This is a miracle.

1368
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:00,180
The colonel in charge of ranger
school happens to be friends with,

1369
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:05,190
uh, Vince Peterson, who we talked about
earlier, and that's not his real name,

1370
01:25:05,191 --> 01:25:10,191
but he's a legendary seal officer and a
prior Vietnam Marine battle away city,

1371
01:25:14,911 --> 01:25:17,640
by the way,
just to just an awesome guy.

1372
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:22,200
And for whatever reason,
miracle,

1373
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:27,450
the colonel that's in charge of
ranger school is friends with,

1374
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:32,160
uh, with Captain Peterson. And here we go.

1375
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:34,560
Going back to the book, you're
sitting there talking to the colonel.

1376
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,740
Vince Peterson was the greatest
natural leader I'd ever known.

1377
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:42,090
He had a knack of expressing where the
team needed to go with just a few words.

1378
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:45,570
He'd plant seeds like his men
taking ownership of the plan.

1379
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,810
Then watched as everything went
forward with the plants when the plants

1380
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,950
succeeded and it almost always did.
He never took the credit.

1381
01:25:52,951 --> 01:25:55,590
He gave it to everyone else.
In retrospect,

1382
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:59,790
I'm not proud that all I
could manage was the fable.

1383
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:02,040
And this goes back to something
you talk about earlier in the book,

1384
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:05,930
but at this point I was still
unable to face the truth myself,

1385
01:26:05,931 --> 01:26:09,860
let alone admitted to the leader
I respected above all others.

1386
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:11,790
Yeah,

1387
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:16,200
and so here you go. Your conversation
with captain Vince Peterson red.

1388
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:21,300
Do you really think ranger school
is punishment? It is sir. Read.

1389
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:26,280
Have you ever thought that maybe
there is an opportunity here, sir?

1390
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:30,810
You have a chance to learn something
of value if you're willing to take it.

1391
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,270
I didn't know what to say to that.

1392
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,150
I had not been trying to learn
anything since Afghanistan.

1393
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:38,580
I had been trying to defend and justify.

1394
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,150
You're getting ready to
throw your career away. Red,

1395
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:46,560
I'm not sure I have a career
left, sir. Red. He said firmly,

1396
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,860
what are you going to do if you get out?
If you come back,

1397
01:26:49,861 --> 01:26:53,910
you'll be out of the navy in a month.
How are you going to support your family?

1398
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:59,730
He let that sink in. I had no
answer and stayed silent. Besides,

1399
01:26:59,731 --> 01:27:03,450
do you really want to go through your
life having ended your career this way?

1400
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:08,370
You can recover.
You control your destiny and your future.

1401
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:12,960
You can earn back the respect of the guys
if you give them something to respect.

1402
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:17,720
If your actions demand respect.
I hadn't looked at it,

1403
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:22,310
my situation from that angle red,
get back in that course.

1404
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,173
Finish it,

1405
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:28,190
then come back with your head held high
and show that you have the ability to

1406
01:27:28,191 --> 01:27:29,024
lead.

1407
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:33,623
Okay.

1408
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:38,780
That'll leave a mark. Yeah. Well, and
you know, for people to understand,

1409
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:42,650
I,
I didn't sleep a wink that night after I,

1410
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:47,710
after I quit and I was so ashamed of what
I had done and I was so convinced that

1411
01:27:49,581 --> 01:27:53,440
there was no way I
could undo it. That, uh,

1412
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:57,620
I literally was just resigned to
the fact that my career was over.

1413
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:02,090
And, uh, when I went into that office, um,

1414
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,030
I first spoke to the sergeant major and
the sergeant major asked if I wanted to

1415
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:08,870
speak to anybody in the seal teams. Hell
no, man, I don't want to talk to anybody.

1416
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:13,100
You know, I am a failure.
I am broken. And, uh,

1417
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,250
and then it was the colonel who
asked me and I said the same thing.

1418
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:20,780
So the mere fact, and this
is, he didn't even offer,

1419
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,060
he just started dialing. Mm. So the,

1420
01:28:23,061 --> 01:28:26,300
and the mere fact he talked
about this bait moment that, uh,

1421
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:32,380
that Vince Peterson will happen to be
at his phone and answer right then and,

1422
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:35,660
and, and saying be on the
phone and him to hand it to me.

1423
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:40,130
And there was no way in hell. I mean,
I had such respect for this, this man,

1424
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:45,830
there was no way I could say no. And
you know that conversation, you know,

1425
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:46,670
this is,

1426
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,750
this is the highest levels of leadership
to be able to quickly analyze the

1427
01:28:50,751 --> 01:28:54,110
situation, especially when you're working
with people to understand, you know,

1428
01:28:54,111 --> 01:28:57,740
okay, this is where we're at, this
is the battlefield I'm looking at.

1429
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:01,230
This is what I have to work with and
this is what I need to do to move this

1430
01:29:01,231 --> 01:29:04,770
person to where we're going to
motivate and inspire them. And I mean,

1431
01:29:04,771 --> 01:29:07,380
he did it flawlessly.
He know exactly what to tell me.

1432
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:09,660
He told me both the good and the bad.

1433
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:13,560
He gave me hope and he told
me what happens if you don't,

1434
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:15,120
which would be hopeless,
you know,

1435
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:18,540
I will have you out of the military and
less than a month. And then, you know,

1436
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:22,230
I tell people that is the most succinct
and powerful leadership advice I've ever

1437
01:29:22,231 --> 01:29:25,140
been given. You know, people will
follow you if you give them a reason to,

1438
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:30,120
if you give them something to respect.
And that really is the foundation of,

1439
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,420
you know, the three rules of
leadership. I talk about lead yourself,

1440
01:29:33,421 --> 01:29:35,310
that's 80% of it,
you know,

1441
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,190
leading others comes naturally
and he was right because

1442
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:43,780
I left that office. And uh, the, the
funny thing about it though, as a,

1443
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,380
I got off the phone and I
asked the colonel, I said

1444
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:47,793
serve,

1445
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:52,420
which put me back in class and uh,
he didn't even miss a beat. No,

1446
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,560
he said instead,
uh,

1447
01:29:57,561 --> 01:30:01,910
you will go to the holding company and
we will class you up with a new class

1448
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:05,450
month later,
which is just what you needed.

1449
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,760
You get rolled back for 30 days.
Going back to the book,

1450
01:30:08,761 --> 01:30:13,380
I bent down and picked up the cigarette
butts lying in the grass at my feet with

1451
01:30:13,381 --> 01:30:15,480
a flick.
The butts spun into the garbage bag.

1452
01:30:15,481 --> 01:30:18,360
I'd been dragging her across post with me.
So here you are,

1453
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:22,830
a combat seal officer
picking up cigarette butts.

1454
01:30:22,831 --> 01:30:26,670
13 years in, 13 years in, as
I filled my bag with litter,

1455
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:31,200
the bit bitterness flared. Again, I've
put 13 I'm putting in 13 and a half years.

1456
01:30:31,201 --> 01:30:34,560
I was a member of one of the most elite
special operations units in modern

1457
01:30:34,561 --> 01:30:37,470
history. Millions of dollars were
spent preparing me, training me,

1458
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:41,100
outfitting me to handle the toughest
battlefield tasks our nation can face and

1459
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:43,650
my own brothers have reduced me to this.

1460
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,030
I stopped and thought
about that statement.

1461
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:51,350
Where was the personal
responsibility in it?

1462
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:54,650
Vince Peterson's word came back to me.

1463
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:59,330
You have an opportunity to learn
here if you're willing to take it.

1464
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:05,090
I served with good men whom I respected.
They turned their back on me

1465
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,520
or did they?
What did all this say about me?

1466
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:13,640
A door suddenly opened in my mind.

1467
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:18,910
The place it led to was a dark room
that I had never entered inside.

1468
01:31:20,091 --> 01:31:24,860
I could see the truth about myself
through the facade of lies I had built.

1469
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:29,270
I stood at its threshold not
really wanting to walk through.

1470
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:34,160
Sensu once said, if you know your
enemies and you know yourself,

1471
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:38,180
you will never be defeated.
I didn't know myself.

1472
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:43,220
I was running blindly through
life, refusing to even
acknowledge my weaknesses.

1473
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:48,200
I have been an arrogant
ass most of my career.

1474
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:50,990
Clearly I needed to come down to earth.

1475
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:55,280
Maybe trash detailed did serve a purpose.
After all,

1476
01:31:55,820 --> 01:32:00,820
I guess I needed to mentally flatline
before I could reconstruct my self for

1477
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:07,390
leadership. I found another cigarette
button, flicked it into my bag.

1478
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:12,220
The bitterness over being forced into
this sort of work evaporated far from a

1479
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:13,570
humiliating burden.

1480
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,830
It was giving me clarity
I surely needed for years.

1481
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:21,610
My attitude had hobbled relationships
and endangered my career.

1482
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:25,750
I suddenly recalled a moment years before
I'd worked my tail off for months on a

1483
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:27,880
special project.
When I finished it,

1484
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:31,000
I knew I was going to receive a
significant award for the effort.

1485
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:34,090
For whatever reason,
it got downgraded to a lesser award.

1486
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,650
What did you do after you found out?
I thrown a temper tantrum.

1487
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:43,270
I went off on one of our admin guys who
had congratulated me after I received it.

1488
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:47,440
Instead of being grateful, receiving any
sort of acknowledgement, I'd thrown the,

1489
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:51,130
awarded him. I might as well have thrown
it in the face of Captain Peterson,

1490
01:32:51,131 --> 01:32:52,750
who was my CEO at the time.

1491
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:56,380
That incident stuck with
my peers who witnessed it.

1492
01:32:56,770 --> 01:33:00,670
And for years after when I ran into
one of them, they'd remind me of it.

1493
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:05,170
Jason Redmond, navy
achievement, medal thrower,

1494
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,690
Van Guard of leadership.

1495
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,590
I can't say I look forward to
picking up trash the next morning,

1496
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:14,440
but I didn't start the day
despising what would come next.

1497
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:19,210
I was ashamed that I'd have thought so
highly of myself that I saw myself as

1498
01:33:19,211 --> 01:33:22,870
above picking up trash.
I realized that as a seal leader,

1499
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:27,900
it was my responsibility to accept the
example with everything I undertook.

1500
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:33,190
There you go.

1501
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:40,480
There you go. It was a, you know, so
this is probably the point. And uh,

1502
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:42,910
I talked to a lot of people about this.
Like,

1503
01:33:42,911 --> 01:33:47,911
I wish I could say that after I hung
up the phone with Captain Peterson,

1504
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:52,720
uh, that I went back and was
like, you know, yeah, let's go,

1505
01:33:52,721 --> 01:33:54,580
let's do this. You know, let's crush this.

1506
01:33:54,581 --> 01:33:57,820
And instead I still was kind of finishing.

1507
01:33:57,821 --> 01:34:02,821
I was on that slope down to crash that
plane and I finally crashed that plane

1508
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:07,450
and hit really the, the
bottom of the barrel. Uh, and,

1509
01:34:07,451 --> 01:34:10,330
and it was at that point that I
really started to analyze myself.

1510
01:34:10,331 --> 01:34:12,780
And this is something I talked to
a lot of people about. You know,

1511
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:14,170
you truly have to know yourself.

1512
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:19,200
You cannot because our
weaknesses manifested
themselves in the hardest times.

1513
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:22,450
Uh, they don't come out in the
good times and the good times,

1514
01:34:22,451 --> 01:34:26,050
there's no issues with it. And the only
way you could manage that, uh, you know,

1515
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:29,590
is true in mental leadership and
emotional leadership at the highest level

1516
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,960
because in the hardest times,

1517
01:34:31,961 --> 01:34:35,380
and usually those are the times you've
got to be managing the most is when it

1518
01:34:35,381 --> 01:34:36,160
comes up.

1519
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:41,160
And it was by really starting
to rip myself apart and look at,

1520
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:45,430
you know, all these things that I
had done and understanding, oh yeah,

1521
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:48,100
when I get into these situations,
I feel that, you know,

1522
01:34:48,101 --> 01:34:52,720
that that meltdown with
the ranger instructors, you
know, I felt that coming on,

1523
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:56,140
I could have stopped it, but I
didn't, I let it go. You know,

1524
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,310
they lit the fuse and instead of tamping

1525
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:03,290
it, you know, out, I let it burn
and blow up. So it was, you know,

1526
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:04,700
really it was these moments,

1527
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:09,080
and this is probably the biggest thing
that I can tell anybody out there.

1528
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:14,160
It is never too late. You
can always come back. Um,

1529
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:14,910
so for,

1530
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:19,190
for months I had convinced myself that I
was a victim for months I had convinced

1531
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:20,900
myself there was no way to do this.

1532
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:24,770
And for the first time when I
finally looked at, you know,

1533
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:26,870
these are your weaknesses,
but oh by the way, man,

1534
01:35:26,871 --> 01:35:29,600
you got some amazing
strengths and you know,

1535
01:35:29,601 --> 01:35:31,760
you need to figure out how
to amplify these strengths,

1536
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:35,540
minimize these weaknesses and,
and what an opportunity you have.

1537
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:40,520
You are a seal that's in ranger school
that couldn't crush this course.

1538
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:44,930
Set the example and come back
every day is another opportunity.

1539
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:48,440
You're going to screw up again.
And that's okay. But you know,

1540
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:53,500
so for the first time I saw hope standing
at the rock bottom and looking up

1541
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:58,400
through this tunnel, I saw a glimmer
of light. Well, what's, what's,

1542
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,860
when you say that,

1543
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:05,861
what I think about is what
people get themselves into.

1544
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:10,580
They boxed themselves into this scenario
and needs to exactly where you had

1545
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:15,110
boxed yourself into, which was,
hey, look, this guy doesn't like me.

1546
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:20,120
This guy's blaming me for
that. This, these people have
a bad attitude and you're,

1547
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:23,480
and, and guess what other
people you can't control.

1548
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:27,080
And so you end up in a hopeless situation
because I can't change this guy's

1549
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:29,000
attitude. He's an asshole.
He doesn't like me.

1550
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:31,940
He whatever we had to run in this person,

1551
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,280
they don't trust me and
I can't change that.

1552
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:38,720
And so when you're in a situation where
you can't change the situation at all

1553
01:36:38,721 --> 01:36:42,350
because you don't have control over
any of it, well then guess what?

1554
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:43,220
You're hopeless.

1555
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:48,320
But the minute you look at yourself
and you say, wait a second,

1556
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:52,790
I actually control everything
that's going on right now.

1557
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:57,880
Everything people's perception
of me is based on my behavior,

1558
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:01,370
not theirs. And that's what,
that's what I liked. What, uh,

1559
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:04,340
what Peterson said you,

1560
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:09,440
you control your destiny and your
future. That's the, that to me,

1561
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:14,000
I highlighted that 98 times.
You control your destiny and your future.

1562
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:18,980
And at this point in the book is where
you saw and it took you for picking up

1563
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:23,120
cigarette butts in. It took you to that
point where you say, wait a second,

1564
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:25,310
all these things that have happened to me,

1565
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:30,520
I can get control with them and I can
turn them in a better direction and yeah.

1566
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:38,310
That's awesome. And the
journey began. Yeah. Um,

1567
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,530
that you kind of expand a little
bit more here. I could not,

1568
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,810
I could not change my decision,
but I should.

1569
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,550
You're talking about this is
when you're talking about,

1570
01:37:46,551 --> 01:37:50,630
you're reflecting now on what happened
on your decision to go into the valley

1571
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:54,020
and Afghanistan. That whole scenario
that you got in trouble for.

1572
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,330
Here's what you said about it.
I could not change my decision,

1573
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,510
but I should have owned
it in its aftermath.

1574
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,440
I should have listened to those with
more experience taking my lumps and moved

1575
01:38:04,441 --> 01:38:06,780
forward.
That is how leaders grow.

1576
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:10,500
I was so desperate to justify
and defend my actions.

1577
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:13,290
I lost sight of what to do
of what I was there to do.

1578
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:16,260
I was there to lead when necessary
and to follow when called upon,

1579
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:19,080
but above all else to accomplish
the mission as part of the team.

1580
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:20,760
Instead in the aftermath,

1581
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,870
I made it all about me
and the defense of my ego.

1582
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:30,390
Again, when you come into the office
and you say, this wasn't my fault,

1583
01:38:30,391 --> 01:38:34,290
I was doing the right thing. Everyone
that's looking at you is thinking he's,

1584
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:37,230
he doesn't even see what he did
wrong and that's where you know,

1585
01:38:37,231 --> 01:38:40,830
you talk about in this book, you talk
about the fact that one of the most,

1586
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:45,780
one of the most horrible things on the
battlefield is an arrogant young person

1587
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:48,150
that thinks there's, there's not
going to listen to anyone. And you,

1588
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:50,790
when you sit there and
put up your defenses,

1589
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:55,050
you're showing everyone that back to the
book. Yes. And your chief Kerry hated me.

1590
01:38:55,051 --> 01:38:58,970
We loved each other, but the truth, he
was a damn good operator in a firefight.

1591
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:02,100
I would've wanted him there as a
tactical leader in his own abrasive way.

1592
01:39:02,101 --> 01:39:05,310
He'd attempted to mentor me.
If I had put down my pride,

1593
01:39:05,311 --> 01:39:08,640
I would've seen it and I would've learned
a lot from him. That never happened.

1594
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:11,880
I failed to manage our relationship
and it poisoned the entire platoon.

1595
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:17,100
It also hurt my reputation
with my teammates. My self
deceit finally collapsed.

1596
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:21,840
Keri had not done this to me.
I done this all to myself.

1597
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:27,620
I was being punished less for the
decision I'd made and more for the way I'd

1598
01:39:27,721 --> 01:39:30,960
fiercely refuse to take
responsibility for it.

1599
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,170
The more I railed against
those aligned against me,

1600
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:39,000
the more I deserve to be punished.
I wasn't betrayed by my teammates.

1601
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:43,890
I betrayed them with my selfishness.
It was time to grow up.

1602
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:47,713
Damn.

1603
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,250
Yeah.
It was exciting because it suddenly,

1604
01:39:55,251 --> 01:39:58,670
ranger school suddenly became
a new opportunity and a really,

1605
01:39:58,671 --> 01:40:02,330
I shut my sights on. Um, you know,
kind of interestingly enough,

1606
01:40:02,331 --> 01:40:04,730
I think all of us are
super goal driven people.

1607
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:09,380
And for the first time I
saw an opportunity and a,

1608
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:13,670
and shut a goal, you know? Yeah. Which is
what I think all of us do show well at,

1609
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:18,320
you know, we, we have a target to move
to and now I have a path to go after it.

1610
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:21,890
Um,
and that that path became,

1611
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:26,950
I want to graduate the honor man
of this course and a PSAT sat the,

1612
01:40:27,591 --> 01:40:31,880
you know, woke up the next morning firing
up the guys around me and a, hey man,

1613
01:40:31,881 --> 01:40:35,480
we're getting ready to start
up again. It's going to be
awesome. Let's go do this.

1614
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,690
So yeah,
again,

1615
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,460
I'm harping on this a little bit,

1616
01:40:39,461 --> 01:40:44,370
but just the fact that this book
is so powerful because to, to,

1617
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:47,680
to walk through that transition,
and I'll tell you,

1618
01:40:47,681 --> 01:40:51,640
anybody that's read extreme ownership or
anyone that listens to this podcast is

1619
01:40:51,641 --> 01:40:55,810
going to be especially, um, they're,

1620
01:40:55,811 --> 01:40:58,660
they're going to be having an even
deeper understanding. Cause they,

1621
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:03,690
I talk about this all the time
and to see you go down that path,

1622
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:06,240
see where it leads and then be
able to come back. I'll be no,

1623
01:41:06,241 --> 01:41:08,170
I'll come back out is awesome.
But,

1624
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:13,200
but it's so powerful to actually hear
from your perspective from someone that

1625
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:20,101
was in that exact position and doing
those things to hear you saying it and be

1626
01:41:21,371 --> 01:41:26,260
able to witness the turnaround.
It's a powerful, powerful stuff.

1627
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,630
Next morning I hit the ground
running and never look back.

1628
01:41:28,631 --> 01:41:32,110
The company I joined was
full of strangers, no matter
I did everything full boar.

1629
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:35,770
Made sure I help, but made sure I help
everyone in my squad whenever I could.

1630
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:37,960
I was going to be the dis.

1631
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:40,810
I wasn't not going to be the
disconnected selfish jerk.

1632
01:41:40,811 --> 01:41:44,980
I had been this go around,
my heart was fully invested

1633
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:50,770
and you kick ass and ranger school,
you're not honor man,

1634
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:52,210
because you find out that,

1635
01:41:52,290 --> 01:41:55,770
yeah, I only find out at the very
end that uh, if you're rolled back,

1636
01:41:55,771 --> 01:41:59,190
you're not eligible.
But I did really well.

1637
01:41:59,191 --> 01:42:01,710
I was ranked at the top of
my period vowels. I mean,

1638
01:42:01,711 --> 01:42:05,220
all the instructors gave me a lot of,
hey man, you're, you're just crushing it.

1639
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:08,670
And uh,
so no matter if it was a goal,

1640
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:11,790
you know that another great guy
earned it and well deserved.

1641
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:15,850
You end up back at the back of the teams,

1642
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:19,120
you go back into a task unit and
you're an assistant platoon commander.

1643
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:21,700
Now this again,
is this a reroll as a,

1644
01:42:21,701 --> 01:42:25,900
is it a re a riff reload as an assistant
platoon commander or were you still

1645
01:42:25,901 --> 01:42:27,850
just super junior cause you
were seeing an animal guy?

1646
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:32,670
No, uh, I had just made JG at this point.

1647
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,770
So back then we still,
you know,

1648
01:42:34,771 --> 01:42:37,580
now they're kind of doing it differently
than a lot of us Shah Sema Dad,

1649
01:42:37,581 --> 01:42:40,120
we're old guys did have the
ability to do two pumps. Yeah,

1650
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:44,610
they made me do two poems.
Yeah. Yeah. They wanted me
to do two pumps and this is,

1651
01:42:44,611 --> 01:42:49,500
I mean, for those who are not
aware, there was a little bit of a

1652
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:56,000
impetus on me because they basically,
so as officers,

1653
01:42:56,001 --> 01:42:59,090
if you ever get a letter of reprimand
in your record at effectively ends your

1654
01:42:59,091 --> 01:43:02,720
career. I mean, if that official letter
goes into your record, you're done,

1655
01:43:02,721 --> 01:43:04,850
you'll remember you won't make the
next rank. You're going to be out.

1656
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,550
And they basically wrote this letter,
uh,

1657
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:12,110
my outgoing CEO who was in Afghanistan
to my incoming CEO who was taken over the

1658
01:43:12,111 --> 01:43:13,670
team and they basically said,

1659
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:19,120
you made some mistakes and we questioned
your tactical decision making and

1660
01:43:20,061 --> 01:43:24,860
leadership abilities, but we're going to
give you a second chance. So this letter,

1661
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:29,040
and I was, you know, I was in the office
with the CEO and he put it into uh,

1662
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:31,700
his safe and basically said,

1663
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,450
this will be burned or shredded
at the end of the deployment.

1664
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:38,480
If you show us you have the ability,
then if you don't,

1665
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:39,680
it will go into your print.

1666
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:41,900
And they had my officer record
right there and they were like,

1667
01:43:41,901 --> 01:43:44,870
it will go right here into your record.
So,

1668
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:49,670
and I think they knew the power of that
also. And it gave me additional momentum.

1669
01:43:49,671 --> 01:43:53,360
And I think this is important in, you
know, I mean, same way we raise our kids,

1670
01:43:53,361 --> 01:43:56,210
there's got to be accountability.
You can't just tell somebody, hey,

1671
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:57,830
this is what I want you to go out and do.

1672
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:01,790
We have to let it lay out the right and
left limits and tell them this is where

1673
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:04,730
you're going to go. And you have to have
those things that hold you accountable.

1674
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:09,210
So I don't know if I necessarily
needed that. I was pretty fired up on,

1675
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:13,010
on wanting to get back and set
the example and redeem myself.

1676
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:17,370
But I will say on the back of my
mind, I knew a man, you, you got to,

1677
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:20,670
you got to crush it. That's uh, that's uh,

1678
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:24,090
I dunno if that's happens
in all the military,

1679
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,980
but in the seal teams there's,

1680
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:31,040
there's a lot of letters that get shredded
and part of it is like a cover your

1681
01:44:31,351 --> 01:44:33,210
ass.
Like when I was a commander,

1682
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:38,250
a part of it's cover your ass
because hey look, you screwed up.

1683
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,550
And if you screw up again and everyone
knows that this has happened multiple

1684
01:44:41,551 --> 01:44:44,340
times and you haven't been counseled
about it, I look like an idiot.

1685
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:46,200
And not only do I look like an idiot,

1686
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:49,110
I am an idiot if I'm not documented
that you screwed something up.

1687
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:52,290
So I'm going to document this
and make sure that, you know,

1688
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:55,650
I've got a documented but by the way,
I'm not trying to kill your career.

1689
01:44:55,651 --> 01:44:57,750
If you can turn around and you
can get back on the path, cool,

1690
01:44:57,751 --> 01:45:01,260
this thing is going in the
shredder but here it is. Got It.

1691
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:05,130
You got some ways to go before this
thing goes in that trigger to it's pretty

1692
01:45:05,131 --> 01:45:09,180
common thing in the seal teams, not too
common. But um, so you're in a task unit,

1693
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:14,400
your assistant platoon commander
and things are going good and you,

1694
01:45:14,401 --> 01:45:19,401
you were a lot more self aware and again
you have to read the whole book to get

1695
01:45:19,471 --> 01:45:21,720
all these details about that transition.

1696
01:45:21,721 --> 01:45:26,721
You were a lot more self aware and you
started off as mobility commander and

1697
01:45:27,061 --> 01:45:29,520
then eventually you start
working with the assault team.

1698
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:33,630
And here we go back to the book
after that first successful mission.

1699
01:45:33,631 --> 01:45:34,560
Now on the assault team,

1700
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:38,520
I had earned a spot in the
mix and harmonized with the
task units, battle rhythm.

1701
01:45:38,521 --> 01:45:42,360
Our platoons rotated back and forth
between running mobility or running the

1702
01:45:42,361 --> 01:45:44,670
assault force.
The pace was intense.

1703
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:49,200
And the mission started to blend
together in a groundhog day sort of way.

1704
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,860
I may have lost my way years ago,

1705
01:45:52,861 --> 01:45:55,860
but through God and a willingness to
work hard and learn my strengths and

1706
01:45:55,861 --> 01:45:56,491
weaknesses,

1707
01:45:56,491 --> 01:46:01,491
I had earned my way back into the
brotherhood and you detail some,

1708
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:06,030
some good missions,
uh,

1709
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:09,750
some pretty hot missions.
You know,

1710
01:46:09,751 --> 01:46:13,500
you guys gotten some pretty good gunfights
and you're getting towards the end of

1711
01:46:13,501 --> 01:46:17,010
deployment and your tea,
you commander, he's, he,

1712
01:46:17,011 --> 01:46:18,990
you have a little conversation
with him and he says,

1713
01:46:18,991 --> 01:46:22,770
we're going to have you run as ground
force commander on the next one for a

1714
01:46:22,771 --> 01:46:23,604
second.

1715
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:28,530
What this really meant failed to register
really JP and the date that this point

1716
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:33,510
in the book, Jp is a guy, he's your
task unit commander. JP nodded.

1717
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:36,360
Yeah, I spoke to Eric and Paul and
we all agree you're ready for it.

1718
01:46:36,361 --> 01:46:41,220
Besides this will help get you up to
speed to be a platoon commander at length.

1719
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:45,210
I finally answered. That's awesome. Thanks
for the opportunity. You earned it bro.

1720
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:49,200
He turned to leave. I had done it.
My career was back on track at last.

1721
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:52,770
I knew so many in our community
would always hate me for my mistakes,

1722
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:56,340
but I had earned back the trust of
the men I served and fought with.

1723
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:59,790
Since 2004 I had been an
officer within our community.

1724
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:01,980
Ranked does not automatically
make you a leader.

1725
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:05,130
Your character makes you a leader.
Your actions make you a leader.

1726
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:06,900
Rank is almost irrelevant.

1727
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:10,500
After years of selfish focus on myself,

1728
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:12,840
I'd finally understood
what it meant to lean men,

1729
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:17,870
lead men of this caliber and what was
required of a man in order to be part of

1730
01:47:18,121 --> 01:47:20,520
this.
Most elite of all fraternities.

1731
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:24,030
The letter in the safe would
be destroyed for an instant.

1732
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:28,350
The horizon ahead held no boundaries.
And again,

1733
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:31,530
I skipped. This was not
like an easy process, man.

1734
01:47:31,531 --> 01:47:34,800
You worked your way right back up.
You started with small jobs,

1735
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,470
you made some mistakes that you, you
know, you, you talk about the uh, you lay,

1736
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:45,490
you lazed the marine, a
Marine colonel and, and uh,

1737
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:49,050
he was not happy about that.
Not Happy. So quick story,

1738
01:47:49,051 --> 01:47:53,010
you're doing deconfliction and you
can't identify and so you escalate the

1739
01:47:53,011 --> 01:47:57,000
deconfliction to a visible laser and then,
you know,

1740
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:00,290
they realize that that both
sides were friendlies and you,

1741
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:03,900
it was a marine corps colonel that you
would lasing and he wasn't too happy

1742
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:08,730
about that. And when you win, when you're
commander brought you in and said, Hey,

1743
01:48:08,731 --> 01:48:11,610
what the hell happened? You took
ownership of it and said, hey,

1744
01:48:11,611 --> 01:48:15,180
here's the mistakes I made
instead of blaming everyone else.

1745
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:19,810
So big, big turning point. And,

1746
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:24,060
and I, and I think this is an important
point. You know, you, you know, I mean,

1747
01:48:24,061 --> 01:48:25,050
within our community,

1748
01:48:25,051 --> 01:48:28,530
it's pretty hard to turn around when
you've made a major mistake like that.

1749
01:48:28,531 --> 01:48:31,300
I mean, obviously guys get
out, uh, we've had guys shed,

1750
01:48:31,301 --> 01:48:33,610
it had been sent to the fleet,
uh,

1751
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:36,600
as some never come back and then
some come back and redeem themselves,

1752
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:37,950
but in a command,

1753
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:43,010
some just get put into a ostracized
position of low importance inside the seal

1754
01:48:45,481 --> 01:48:48,510
teams. Right? And it's like,
oh, cool. Yup. You, Oh yeah,

1755
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:50,670
you're stationed over there yet.
We know where you're doing.

1756
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:51,960
And we know all about you and,

1757
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:57,000
and we get that you still
have your trident and you're
still considered a seal,

1758
01:48:57,001 --> 01:48:59,320
but you're not a team guy.
And we all know that, yeah.

1759
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:02,850
That you would not be invited to go
back to an operational billet. You know,

1760
01:49:02,851 --> 01:49:06,570
you're relegated to training and
all the other things. So, I mean,

1761
01:49:06,571 --> 01:49:08,790
it really is for people to understand.
I mean,

1762
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:13,410
our community is driven by
amazingly talented warriors.

1763
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:15,630
And at the end of the
day, you know, the leader,

1764
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:19,680
they rely on the guys next to them
and their leaders to make those good

1765
01:49:19,681 --> 01:49:21,690
decisions.
So if you've made bad decisions,

1766
01:49:21,691 --> 01:49:24,450
I mean to be able to come back
and them say, okay, you know,

1767
01:49:24,451 --> 01:49:27,670
you've shown us that we can
trust you once again, uh,

1768
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:32,280
to lead and make the right
decision. So, um, it really,

1769
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,190
I tell people there's a hardest
road I've ever walked. I mean,

1770
01:49:35,191 --> 01:49:40,140
when I got wounded I was
like, I got this. Yeah. The,

1771
01:49:40,141 --> 01:49:40,560
uh,

1772
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:45,330
the trust when broken is
extremely hard to rebuild.

1773
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:49,660
And I get asked a lot, how do you
build trust with people? Either,

1774
01:49:49,661 --> 01:49:52,210
whether it's been broken or whether you
don't know him and it's very clear in

1775
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:52,481
the book,

1776
01:49:52,481 --> 01:49:57,340
and again this is why people should get
the book the way that your task unit

1777
01:49:57,341 --> 01:50:01,030
commander, and I'm trying to think of
the alias because I know him to a JP,

1778
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:04,180
the way that you're tasking the commanders
very common to what a guy does. He,

1779
01:50:04,190 --> 01:50:09,190
he gives you a little bit
of responsibility and let
you let you earn a little

1780
01:50:09,611 --> 01:50:12,580
bit of trust and then once you've earned
a little bit of trust to gives you a

1781
01:50:12,581 --> 01:50:15,250
little bit more responsibility once
you've earned a little bit more trust.

1782
01:50:15,251 --> 01:50:16,660
And that continued going,
this is,

1783
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:20,320
this is now a six month deployment
plus a year long workup or whatever.

1784
01:50:20,321 --> 01:50:23,590
So He's been giving you a little bit of
trust in you've been earning and earning

1785
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:26,560
and earning and earning back your trust
and you are digging out of a deficit,

1786
01:50:26,561 --> 01:50:27,940
right?
That's a lot harder.

1787
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:32,110
So that is a lot harder when
if you show up as a new guy,

1788
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:33,820
you're like a zero,
right?

1789
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,720
Cause p and then you're going to get a
little trust and maybe get to a 0.2 and

1790
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:40,510
then you get a little bit more
responsibility and you get to a point for,

1791
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:45,250
you were at like a negative nine.
And so you had to just, you know,

1792
01:50:45,251 --> 01:50:49,390
earn your way back to get to zero.
And then once you're at zero,

1793
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:53,530
then you had to build up. And at this
point in the book, and you did some,

1794
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,470
again, I'm sorry I'm not
going to go into everything,

1795
01:50:56,471 --> 01:50:59,170
but you knew you had a pretty dynamic,
uh,

1796
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:03,610
potentially horrible situation on
folding big gun fight going on.

1797
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:08,530
Some head counts not accounted for people
and you took charge of the situation

1798
01:51:08,531 --> 01:51:10,580
and that probably is what,
you know,

1799
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:14,470
jumped you up a bunch of levels in
people going, okay, you know what,

1800
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,480
we can trust this guy. And, and,

1801
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:21,160
and then you continued these to build
that trust and up to the point where I

1802
01:51:21,161 --> 01:51:21,821
need to explain this,

1803
01:51:21,821 --> 01:51:25,990
cause I didn't up to the point where
the task unit commander said, okay,

1804
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,120
one of these next coming missions,

1805
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,250
we're going to make you
the ground force commander.

1806
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:34,900
And what that means for civilians is that
means you're in charge of everything.

1807
01:51:34,901 --> 01:51:38,500
You're going to go out, you're gonna
be the, this, the, the main leader,

1808
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,840
the senior leader, not even the main,
they're going to be the senior leader,

1809
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:43,690
the guy in charge of everything
that's happening on the battlefield.

1810
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:47,320
That's what the ground force commander is.
And you're now being,

1811
01:51:47,321 --> 01:51:50,260
it's enda deployment. You're
being told, look, you've, hey,

1812
01:51:50,261 --> 01:51:52,960
we want you to be the ground
force commander in one of
these upcoming operations.

1813
01:51:52,961 --> 01:51:57,961
And that is the ultimate trust for
someone to give to a subordinate is,

1814
01:51:59,801 --> 01:52:04,270
hey, I want you to go out and take my job
that I would normally do you go do it.

1815
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:09,790
So, pretty amazing, uh,
come back. Uh, humbling.

1816
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:10,853
I mean,
yeah.

1817
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:17,370
So you're almost at the
end of deployment and uh,

1818
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:21,870
like uh, uh, an op comes up,
we were one week away. Yep.

1819
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:25,390
[inaudible] to get ready to go home.
Um,

1820
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:29,650
no to self those last operations,

1821
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:33,930
be careful for first and last man,
the first mission is,

1822
01:52:33,931 --> 01:52:37,840
and the last one's a Gotcha.
You and it's

1823
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,390
the mission comes down.

1824
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:41,800
It's one of those missions
where you guys are kind of like,

1825
01:52:41,801 --> 01:52:44,590
this probably isn't going to go down.
It's sketchy intel,

1826
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,980
the high visibility if it

1827
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:49,800
goes in your thinking because we get a
lot of those, Oh this is going to happen.

1828
01:52:49,801 --> 01:52:53,180
And you get used to getting all amped up
and then eventually you don't even get

1829
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:56,630
amped up anymore. You continue with your
daily routine, go to the gym, workout,

1830
01:52:56,631 --> 01:53:00,770
whatever. And this particular case, you
guys, you, you literally went to the gym,

1831
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:02,150
you're working out like normal.

1832
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:06,050
And I didn't think there was a chance
in hell this mission was going to happen

1833
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:08,150
and some of the guys
who were looking at it,

1834
01:53:08,151 --> 01:53:12,200
but I just didn't think it was going
to happen. It was already late. Uh,

1835
01:53:12,201 --> 01:53:16,130
so we were outside really
the window, um, you know,

1836
01:53:16,131 --> 01:53:20,150
to really try and execute in a,
in a good manner in my opinion.

1837
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:22,220
And then there were external things,
you know,

1838
01:53:22,221 --> 01:53:25,310
there's some classified factors to it
that I don't talk about in the book where,

1839
01:53:25,311 --> 01:53:26,061
which were others.

1840
01:53:26,061 --> 01:53:29,960
Some of the really big reasons why I did
not think there was any chance this was

1841
01:53:29,961 --> 01:53:32,750
going to happen.
But,

1842
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:37,310
but it does and you guys roll out on a,
you know,

1843
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:42,540
al-Qaida target and definitely you
guys had the intel that bad guys,

1844
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:49,290
expected security team expect
enemy security team expected.

1845
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:54,210
And, and again, like we would
hear that a lot. I mean,

1846
01:53:54,211 --> 01:53:55,770
it's not like,
it's not like,

1847
01:53:55,890 --> 01:54:00,720
oh this Intel's 100% and you're
not gonna do anything different.

1848
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:03,750
They tell you there's a security team,
enemy security team. You're like, okay,

1849
01:54:03,751 --> 01:54:06,570
check.
We've heard that 27 times.

1850
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:11,720
They've only been there however many
times. And so you always, always expect it

1851
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,730
that they had,

1852
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:16,870
there was a little more
detailed information about
this security detail that

1853
01:54:16,871 --> 01:54:19,630
made it a little bit hairier than
some of our regular missions.

1854
01:54:19,631 --> 01:54:23,510
I mean there were things
that we knew. Um, uh,

1855
01:54:25,450 --> 01:54:26,730
yeah,
I can't get into the day.

1856
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,100
I can't get into the details but
basic more solid into absolutely.

1857
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:33,760
So it made it a little bit different
and kind of raised our hackles a little

1858
01:54:33,761 --> 01:54:37,600
more than normal. But you know, the
process of the mission is the same.

1859
01:54:37,601 --> 01:54:41,710
I mean I know probably you, I've talked
to other people, you know, the guy said,

1860
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:45,400
did the bin Laden raid the mechanics
of that mission where the same,

1861
01:54:45,730 --> 01:54:47,440
it was just a level,
you know,

1862
01:54:47,710 --> 01:54:51,670
how we take down a target is pretty much
the same regardless of where you go.

1863
01:54:51,671 --> 01:54:55,210
And it was the same for this case. There
were just some things that made us go,

1864
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:57,180
maybe we should prepare a little more.

1865
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:04,280
You guys roll on to target
and things get pretty,

1866
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:10,050
pretty intense pretty quick. Once
you've, once you've hit the target,

1867
01:55:10,051 --> 01:55:11,010
you've got it secured.

1868
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:14,580
Now we got some squirters meeting some
folks that we think of runaway from the

1869
01:55:14,581 --> 01:55:17,670
target building. Again, I'm not going to
go into the full detail of the mission,

1870
01:55:17,671 --> 01:55:20,910
which you did a beautiful
job of explaining what this
was like in the book and

1871
01:55:20,911 --> 01:55:24,090
that's why he was get the books.
They can read it,

1872
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:28,260
but as we mentioned earlier,

1873
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:31,950
this ends up in a firefight and
you're in it. Going back to the book,

1874
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:35,700
I keep my radio and called JP
troops in contact troops in contact.

1875
01:55:35,701 --> 01:55:37,470
I have three wounded,
including me.

1876
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:41,880
The machine guns were still blazing away
at us and they walk their barrels right

1877
01:55:41,881 --> 01:55:46,800
and left criss crossing positions with
hundreds of 7.62 millimeter bullets.

1878
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:50,670
I recognize that if I didn't
get a tourniquet on what
I fought was the stump of

1879
01:55:50,671 --> 01:55:52,710
my left arm,
I was going to bleed out.

1880
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:56,490
I looked back at owl and the
rest of my team behind the tire.

1881
01:55:56,850 --> 01:56:00,270
Right then owl saw me get to my
feet and try and run to join them.

1882
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:02,580
Al told me this later,
but I have no recollection,

1883
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:06,170
recollection of standing up after I
was hit the first time the PKM Gunnar

1884
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:09,330
spotted me moving and laid on his trigger.
According to Al,

1885
01:56:09,331 --> 01:56:11,430
I'd only taken a step or two in my head.

1886
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:15,660
Whipsawed forward and my body
spun around to the left. I fell,

1887
01:56:15,661 --> 01:56:19,020
limped to the ground.
The team thought I'd been killed.

1888
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:25,200
Al Recognize the dire situation we ran
and called it an immediate fire mission.

1889
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:30,060
The [inaudible] crew turned it down
the first time two times before finally

1890
01:56:30,061 --> 01:56:34,170
making. Al acknowledged that if anything
happened to us, it was Al's fault,

1891
01:56:34,171 --> 01:56:35,550
not the gun ships.

1892
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:38,820
The first 25 millimeter shells
hit the thicket behind the enemy.

1893
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:43,530
I lay less than 50 feet from the
enemy machine gun that engaged me.

1894
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:46,590
I drifted in and out of
consciousness the entire time.

1895
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:50,580
Awake in a fog of confusion.
One minute out cold.

1896
01:56:50,581 --> 01:56:55,581
The next al risked his life to
save me during a lull and fire.

1897
01:56:55,711 --> 01:57:00,120
He rose from behind the tire and charged
over to me. Shawn laid down cover fire.

1898
01:57:00,121 --> 01:57:05,121
As Al ran into the teeth of that PKM
bullets cracked and we wind around him,

1899
01:57:05,461 --> 01:57:08,910
but he reached me and dragged me back
behind the tire where he put a tourniquet

1900
01:57:08,911 --> 01:57:10,260
on my mangled arm.

1901
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:15,260
I remember nothing of this and I didn't
know al had even moved me to the tire

1902
01:57:15,261 --> 01:57:16,940
until months after the fire fight.

1903
01:57:18,590 --> 01:57:23,240
The Medevac bird arrived a few minutes
later and the guys helped us aboard.

1904
01:57:23,330 --> 01:57:27,370
Once we were airborne and out of harm's
way, the remainder of the task you'd,

1905
01:57:27,371 --> 01:57:30,320
it fell back to the original target
compound to wait for extract,

1906
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:32,630
but the fight was over.
The gunshot.

1907
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:36,320
Gunship detected more movement in
the thicket. Enough was enough.

1908
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:40,280
Al called in one o five millimeter
howitzer from the AC one 30 and turned the

1909
01:57:40,281 --> 01:57:44,990
thicket into a smoking crater.
Months later when JP visited me at home,

1910
01:57:44,991 --> 01:57:48,170
I learned that the al Qaeda commander had
fled the house when he heard our birds

1911
01:57:48,171 --> 01:57:49,520
coming at the start of the mission,

1912
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:54,320
he left part of his personal security
detail behind a fight, a battle.

1913
01:57:54,321 --> 01:57:58,550
He had no stomach for himself
and they died to the last man.

1914
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:02,390
After inflicting three casualties on us,
months later,

1915
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:06,650
another seal team ran the al Qaeda
commander to the ground and killed him.

1916
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:08,350
Okay.

1917
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:09,910
Justice served.

1918
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,310
So

1919
01:58:20,150 --> 01:58:22,700
that firefight, and again, people should,

1920
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:26,940
should read the book to get the
details of that firefight. But, uh,

1921
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,390
just reading about you wounded,

1922
01:58:29,391 --> 01:58:32,930
which I've covered that part and now
you're up and running and get shot in the

1923
01:58:32,931 --> 01:58:36,560
face and down.

1924
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:41,060
Every BYO guys think you're dead.
And,

1925
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:42,000
and you know,
I

1926
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,350
should have covered this with a little
bit more detailed, but you know,

1927
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:47,110
you're trying to make calls, you're
trying to let people know what's going on.

1928
01:58:47,111 --> 01:58:51,550
You're trying to decipher the situation
cause it was a rough situation that you

1929
01:58:51,551 --> 01:58:56,180
guys were in and you end up,
you know,

1930
01:58:57,070 --> 01:58:57,540
okay,

1931
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:02,410
getting extracted.
Your boys took care of you.

1932
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,320
That did I owe my life to those guys.

1933
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:09,370
I mean they fought back that
gunship overhead. Um, you know,

1934
01:59:09,371 --> 01:59:12,490
force Special Operations Squadron.
I owe my life to those guys.

1935
01:59:12,491 --> 01:59:16,960
That was the closest fire mission ever
in the Iraq war. Um, we were, well,

1936
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:19,300
well they wouldn't bring in
that mission because we were,

1937
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:23,650
we were literally within
any danger close parameter.

1938
01:59:23,651 --> 01:59:27,790
There were the machine guns that had me
pinned down. Uh, we're about 45 feet,

1939
01:59:27,791 --> 01:59:30,820
50 feet away. So, um,

1940
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:33,610
owl did an amazing job.
I mean,

1941
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:38,030
this was his third combat deployment, you
know, experience Jay, attack experience,

1942
01:59:38,031 --> 01:59:42,310
team leader, and you know, really,
I mean, he hung it all out there,

1943
01:59:42,311 --> 01:59:45,910
exposed himself to get me saved my life
with my tourniquet and the rest of the

1944
01:59:45,911 --> 01:59:46,660
guys,
you know,

1945
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:50,850
fought amazingly [inaudible] to get us
out of there and get off the accident

1946
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:54,580
survive. And um, yeah,

1947
01:59:54,581 --> 01:59:57,340
I wanted Al to get a navy cross.
Um,

1948
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:01,030
they downgraded it to a silver
star to this day, you know,

1949
02:00:01,031 --> 02:00:03,940
I'll tell anyone he deserved a navy cross,

1950
02:00:03,941 --> 02:00:06,850
but all those guys did an amazing job.
I owe my life,

1951
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:11,500
my life to them and the gun ship it.

1952
02:00:11,501 --> 02:00:14,740
Um, and obviously, you know, in the
beginning of the book, you know,

1953
02:00:14,741 --> 02:00:18,070
the thought that I had lost my arm and
what tent, what happened is actually,

1954
02:00:18,071 --> 02:00:22,510
I guess my arm was pinned under me. So
when I reached for it, I couldn't feel it.

1955
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:27,400
And you know, it just stunned
all my nerves damage too,
right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1956
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:29,560
So when, when, uh,

1957
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:33,340
and this is kind of an interesting
point that I talked to people about and

1958
02:00:33,341 --> 02:00:38,320
something I'm speaking on all the
time now, this idea of surviving.

1959
02:00:38,321 --> 02:00:40,170
So having trained in a career where we,

1960
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:45,180
where we learn how to execute ruthless
and devastating violence of action in an

1961
02:00:45,971 --> 02:00:50,971
ambush to crush the enemy and destroy
the enemy in that kill zone on the x and

1962
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,960
to now be on the flip side of that coin
and be in a very well executed ambush.

1963
02:00:57,970 --> 02:01:01,930
I mean, they had us, it was an la ambush.
They had us caught a very good crossfire,

1964
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:06,890
um, you know, and just sheer
will for us to fight. And,

1965
02:01:06,990 --> 02:01:11,990
and at least in that, uh, push back
enough that it gave us a window and,

1966
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,480
and by the end cheer,

1967
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:17,740
we were shooting a lock that
there happened to be that
tractor tire back there,

1968
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:19,450
at least one point of cover.

1969
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:23,500
Because beyond that there was nothing
but thousands of yards of open Iraqi

1970
02:01:23,501 --> 02:01:28,150
desert. But to be in that ambush, uh,

1971
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,210
in that devastating and
withering crossfire,

1972
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:36,150
I stepped out of that
ambush into another ambush.

1973
02:01:36,151 --> 02:01:40,820
And the next day ambush was what I
call a life. Suddenly here I was,

1974
02:01:40,821 --> 02:01:45,350
I'd been on this amazing
journey of failure, uh,

1975
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:47,540
growth,
understanding,

1976
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:51,890
gaining experience and wisdom
and redemption and, you know,

1977
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:56,210
career back on track,
getting ready to, um,

1978
02:01:56,270 --> 02:02:00,650
screen and go over to the next level.
Seal team was my goal.

1979
02:02:00,651 --> 02:02:03,320
When I came back from that deployment,
I was doing that.

1980
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:07,670
And suddenly to find myself
laying in a hospital bed,

1981
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:11,660
I'm so weak. I needed nurses
to help me go to the bathroom.

1982
02:02:11,661 --> 02:02:13,850
From the amount of blood loss I had a,

1983
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:16,340
the very first thing I woke to
was the doctor's telling me,

1984
02:02:16,341 --> 02:02:20,150
most likely they were going to have to
amputate my arm. I had no use of my hand.

1985
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:24,800
Uh, I had not seen myself in the
mirror. My face was totally blown apart.

1986
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:30,010
Um, I had lost my nose, a
cheekbone, my eye, my bay,

1987
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:33,560
the bullet traveled, the bullet
hit me right in front of the ear,

1988
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:36,470
travel through my face,
and exited the right side of my nose.

1989
02:02:36,471 --> 02:02:40,940
So it took off most of my nose.
Uh, took out most of my cheekbone.

1990
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:43,400
It vaporized my orbital floor.
So my,

1991
02:02:43,401 --> 02:02:47,330
I actually dropped down into
the newfound hole in my face,

1992
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:51,760
so it damaged my eye muscles, uh,
broke all the bones above my eye.

1993
02:02:51,761 --> 02:02:55,590
It shattered my jaw, broke
my jaw in my chin. Um,

1994
02:02:56,120 --> 02:03:00,410
so I had not seen myself laying in the
hospital bed and I'll be honest, I was,

1995
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:05,210
I wasn't ready to look at myself. Um, I
knew I had tubes coming out of everywhere.

1996
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:07,670
I was tricked, I was wired
shut, I had a stomach tube.

1997
02:03:07,671 --> 02:03:12,380
That's how they were feeding me.
So I stepped into this next ambush.

1998
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:17,600
Um, I was, you know, with this
thought of where do I go from here?

1999
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:20,870
And
I'll be honest,

2000
02:03:20,871 --> 02:03:24,290
for the first couple of days I kind of
struggled and I think this is natural.

2001
02:03:24,291 --> 02:03:29,090
So we talk about this idea of being
pinned down on the x and how we have to

2002
02:03:29,091 --> 02:03:31,010
survive in,

2003
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:34,670
whether it's a real world ambush or
it's a life ambush for anyone that's out

2004
02:03:34,671 --> 02:03:37,250
there that's encountered some
sort of devastating event.

2005
02:03:37,251 --> 02:03:40,850
And I classify life ambushes and event
that'll forever leave physical, mental,

2006
02:03:40,851 --> 02:03:44,360
or emotional scars on you.
Um, you have to get off the x.

2007
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:47,990
So I'm laying there in this hospital bed
and I'm like kicking myself. I'm like,

2008
02:03:47,991 --> 02:03:48,531
God,
man,

2009
02:03:48,531 --> 02:03:53,531
what if I had you do the things that
humans do when bad things happen?

2010
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:57,470
We start to think, well, what if I had
done this or what if I had done that? Or,

2011
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:02,570
you know, what if I could go
back and change this fact? And,

2012
02:04:02,571 --> 02:04:07,520
uh, I did that for probably, I don't
know, 36 hours after I got to Bethesda,

2013
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:10,100
you know, just kind of lost
in my mind thinking about it.

2014
02:04:10,101 --> 02:04:12,740
And at one point I just said,
stop.

2015
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:17,000
You can't go back and change the past
and the hand. What's happens happened.

2016
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:20,150
The only thing you can
do is shape the future.

2017
02:04:20,330 --> 02:04:24,140
And I thought back to that journey
that I had been on from ground zero,

2018
02:04:24,141 --> 02:04:28,310
from that broken man in Afghanistan,

2019
02:04:28,311 --> 02:04:32,000
ready to kill myself to where
I had come. And I said, dude,

2020
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:35,720
the only thing you can do from
here is shaped the future.

2021
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:37,920
So get off the and go.

2022
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:42,870
And I never looked back from that
point. Um, and I tell people that,

2023
02:04:42,871 --> 02:04:43,111
you know,

2024
02:04:43,111 --> 02:04:48,111
you have to push yourself into those zones
and discomfort so that you can handle

2025
02:04:48,331 --> 02:04:52,560
these hard situations when they come.
Because if you've never forged yourself,

2026
02:04:52,561 --> 02:04:55,260
if you've never been put into
these areas of discomfort,

2027
02:04:55,470 --> 02:04:58,650
you're going to be crushed when they come
because you're not going to be ready.

2028
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:02,620
I was so ready for that moment
when it came. I mean, you know,

2029
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:05,820
it took me about 36 hours after I
got home to figure it out, but still,

2030
02:05:05,821 --> 02:05:10,110
that's pretty quick for a devastating
injury like that. And I never looked back.

2031
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:14,180
You're, you're in Bethesda. And just to,

2032
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:18,160
just to kind of give a little
bit of detail around that,
you've got some doctor,

2033
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:22,700
a name female doctor named Dr Maillard,
and here we go back to the book,

2034
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:25,070
kind of like she's about
to list your kind of,

2035
02:05:25,071 --> 02:05:28,610
your situation that you're
in with energetic bluntness.

2036
02:05:28,611 --> 02:05:30,290
She laid out the extent of my wounds.

2037
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:32,900
The machine gun bullet entered
just in front of my right ear.

2038
02:05:32,901 --> 02:05:37,010
It shattered my job, vaporized my right
orbital floor, destroyed my cheek,

2039
02:05:37,011 --> 02:05:39,950
and exited through my nose.
I'd suffered nerve damage as well.

2040
02:05:40,070 --> 02:05:43,730
Virtually nothing was left in my cheek
bone or ocular floor bones on the right

2041
02:05:43,731 --> 02:05:48,090
side of my face. She and her team was
amazed. I didn't suffer greater I damage,

2042
02:05:48,091 --> 02:05:49,070
so that was a blessing.

2043
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:52,970
My nose was almost completely destroyed
and we need a full reconstruction.

2044
02:05:53,210 --> 02:05:55,460
They would need to repair
my shattered jaw implant,

2045
02:05:55,461 --> 02:05:59,960
a titanium plate to replace the ocular
floor and we'd have to repair the damage

2046
02:05:59,961 --> 02:06:02,270
to the rest of my facial
bones on the right side.

2047
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:06,260
I was still under the impression they
could fix me right up and get me back into

2048
02:06:06,261 --> 02:06:10,640
the teams. Not, not
now. I was not so sure.

2049
02:06:10,641 --> 02:06:11,660
And you were at this point,

2050
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:14,150
your jaw jaws wired shut and
your traits so you can't talk.

2051
02:06:14,151 --> 02:06:18,080
So you write out a note. How many weeks
are we looking at here, doc weeks?

2052
02:06:18,110 --> 02:06:22,700
She said surprised. No,
Jay. We're talking years.

2053
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:26,840
A few years.
At least years.

2054
02:06:27,620 --> 02:06:31,370
It didn't even sink in at first
there would be progressive surgeries.

2055
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:35,090
Each one will need to be fully healed
before we can move on to the next one.

2056
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:38,690
She went on to explain that there was
no roadmap for the extent of the, Eh,

2057
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,480
because of the extent
and nature of my wounds.

2058
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:46,220
My case was highly complex and I would
recall require extensive bone and skin

2059
02:06:46,221 --> 02:06:49,850
grafts in the years ahead.
After she left,

2060
02:06:49,851 --> 02:06:51,440
I struggled to keep my spirits up.

2061
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:55,310
This was news I did not want to hear.

2062
02:06:58,790 --> 02:06:59,623
Yeah.

2063
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:03,580
You know, and this should an
interesting, uh, fact I, you know,

2064
02:07:03,581 --> 02:07:06,700
I talked to a lot of other team guys
about this. I think a lot of us,

2065
02:07:06,701 --> 02:07:10,010
we do a really good job
in the seal teams and I,

2066
02:07:10,011 --> 02:07:12,670
I would like to assume other
military units do the same.

2067
02:07:12,671 --> 02:07:16,810
We do a really good job of preparing
guys if they get killed. Uh, you know,

2068
02:07:16,811 --> 02:07:20,290
page two, we make sure
they're all taken care of. Um,

2069
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:23,500
I don't think any of us ever
give much thought. I sure didn't.

2070
02:07:23,501 --> 02:07:25,840
If I was severely wounded.
Uh,

2071
02:07:25,841 --> 02:07:29,200
I think most of us think one
side of the coin is, you know,

2072
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:31,780
it'll be merely a merely a flesh wound,
you know,

2073
02:07:31,781 --> 02:07:36,040
and we'll walk away and we'll
get back. Uh, and then the other

2074
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,920
side of the coin is I'll be killed
and I was good with either of those.

2075
02:07:38,921 --> 02:07:41,440
I just kind of resigned
myself to that fact.

2076
02:07:41,441 --> 02:07:46,441
So it was a whole nother thing to be
severely wounded and be faced with this

2077
02:07:46,451 --> 02:07:49,570
fact that, hey, you may
be forever disabled,

2078
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:50,603
uh,

2079
02:07:53,050 --> 02:07:56,800
and it was tough for you and
here's you run into this situation.

2080
02:07:56,801 --> 02:07:59,920
Going back to the book, one afternoon
to family members came to visit us.

2081
02:07:59,921 --> 02:08:02,860
Erica took the opportunity to step
out and grab some lunch for herself.

2082
02:08:03,190 --> 02:08:06,370
I talked with them for a bit, which
left, which quickly fatigued me.

2083
02:08:06,371 --> 02:08:09,610
I started to drift off before I
even realized it while I was dozing.

2084
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:13,570
I heard them whispering to each other and
only got fragments of the conversation,

2085
02:08:13,571 --> 02:08:16,480
but it was enough.
They were full of PD for me.

2086
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:19,960
When Erica returned and
my relatives departed,

2087
02:08:19,961 --> 02:08:24,550
I wrote down all that had happened,
recounting it sent me into a fury again.

2088
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:26,710
I tore off the sheet of
paper and handed it to her.

2089
02:08:27,010 --> 02:08:30,310
Then I thought for a minute
and added never again.

2090
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:33,700
Never again would someone
seal feel sorry for me.

2091
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:37,630
I fought for my country and I'll fight
to regain my health so I will ultimately

2092
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:42,460
be able to return to our nation's
battlefields. I was not here for sympathy.

2093
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:46,450
I was here to recover, to be a leader,
to set an example of mental fortitude.

2094
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:50,170
It would be all too easy to give
up into despair, but I refused.

2095
02:08:50,590 --> 02:08:54,190
There were men and women in this complex
who were far more badly wounded than I

2096
02:08:54,191 --> 02:08:59,110
was. Missing limbs burned, suffering,
brain trauma or eyesight loss.

2097
02:08:59,530 --> 02:09:04,030
I would be grateful for
what I had determined to
succeed in the days ahead and

2098
02:09:04,031 --> 02:09:07,300
when you use these principles I learned
over the last two years to guide me

2099
02:09:07,301 --> 02:09:08,050
forward.

2100
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:13,050
I wrote a note to all my visitors and
ask Erica to hang it up on the door and

2101
02:09:13,181 --> 02:09:16,720
here's what the note said.
Attention to all who enter here.

2102
02:09:17,650 --> 02:09:22,120
If you are coming into this room with
sorrow or to feel sorry for my wounds,

2103
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:26,860
go elsewhere. The wounds I
received, I gotten a job.

2104
02:09:26,861 --> 02:09:28,900
I love doing it for people.

2105
02:09:28,901 --> 02:09:32,830
I love supporting the freedom
of a country I deeply love.

2106
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:38,830
I am incredibly tough and we'll make a
full recovery what is full that is the

2107
02:09:39,370 --> 02:09:44,370
absolute utmost physically my
body has the ability to recover.

2108
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:50,370
Then I will push that about 20%
further through sheer mental tenacity.

2109
02:09:51,970 --> 02:09:56,970
This room you are about to enter his
room of fun optimism and intense rapid

2110
02:09:57,430 --> 02:10:01,420
regrowth. If you are not
prepared for that, go elsewhere

2111
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:03,093
from

2112
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:04,733
the management.

2113
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:11,790
And uh,
awesome.

2114
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:15,240
I mean in that picture got sent to me
by someone and eventually it got sent to

2115
02:10:15,241 --> 02:10:18,670
everyone by everyone. So it was a, uh,

2116
02:10:18,830 --> 02:10:22,890
a viral picture of that sign on your
door that you eventually put in bigger

2117
02:10:22,891 --> 02:10:25,260
writing to make sure everyone saw it.
That's right.

2118
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:27,773
MMM.

2119
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:33,650
You, yeah. You eventually you
do get home and, and again,

2120
02:10:33,651 --> 02:10:34,310
you know what always

2121
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:36,410
I Chuck,
Oh,

2122
02:10:36,450 --> 02:10:39,680
I want to make a really important
point about this cause that,

2123
02:10:39,681 --> 02:10:43,490
that that was really a
learning point for me.

2124
02:10:43,491 --> 02:10:46,430
Or it was a jump point.
And it,

2125
02:10:46,431 --> 02:10:49,730
and it comes back to what we've two we
talked about earlier in the beginning,

2126
02:10:49,731 --> 02:10:53,570
a little bit of this social leadership
idea, who you surround yourself with.

2127
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:56,930
And in that moment I had
individuals to want to express pity.

2128
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:02,300
And I realized how dangerous that was
because if I listened too long to people

2129
02:11:02,301 --> 02:11:06,950
express that it would be easy to accept
that to accept this victim mentality.

2130
02:11:07,190 --> 02:11:09,620
And I've walked that road
before and I was like,

2131
02:11:09,621 --> 02:11:13,340
no way am I going to allow that to happen.
It is a choice.

2132
02:11:13,341 --> 02:11:15,170
And that's what people need to understand.
You know,

2133
02:11:15,171 --> 02:11:20,171
having a positive attitude on how you
handle the situations you're in is a

2134
02:11:20,841 --> 02:11:24,830
choice. And the more you accept
positivity and drive it forward,

2135
02:11:24,831 --> 02:11:28,700
the more you actually start to believe
it and it will create momentum.

2136
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:32,000
And that's really what happened
with that sign. I said,

2137
02:11:32,001 --> 02:11:33,980
I will not allow that to happen again.

2138
02:11:33,981 --> 02:11:38,050
No one will come in here and
be sad because I refused.

2139
02:11:38,051 --> 02:11:42,080
I will not allow it. And, uh, and you,

2140
02:11:42,110 --> 02:11:44,960
you never know the impact of the
decision that you're going to make. You,

2141
02:11:44,961 --> 02:11:49,010
you never know how, even though deep
down inside you're like, Holy Shit,

2142
02:11:49,011 --> 02:11:50,420
how do I get out of this situation?

2143
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:55,580
But you project that positivity who you
can bring with you and bring up and how

2144
02:11:55,581 --> 02:11:59,000
much you can leave a,
an impact that lasts a lifetime.

2145
02:11:59,930 --> 02:12:04,400
That sign has gone on to help
hundreds of thousands of people.

2146
02:12:04,401 --> 02:12:08,170
I've had people write me that have
had cancer. I've had people that have,

2147
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:11,750
that have written me, that have
had major, horrific accidents.

2148
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:16,710
I didn't keep the sign. I had it framed
and it hangs in the wound who ward,

2149
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:21,470
uh, Walter Reed. And the bottom of
the sign is like, rub clean now.

2150
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:24,260
And uh, I'm told that all of
these wounded warriors, whatever,

2151
02:12:24,261 --> 02:12:27,710
they go to a surgery,
they go by and they rub it and it just,

2152
02:12:27,711 --> 02:12:30,200
it continues to have this impact.
Um,

2153
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:33,540
secretary gates wrote about
the sign in his book. Uh,

2154
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:35,360
Michelle Obama's book just came out.

2155
02:12:35,361 --> 02:12:37,670
She wrote about the sign
and what the impact is.

2156
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,030
So one moment of saying,

2157
02:12:41,090 --> 02:12:46,090
I'm not going to allow someone else
to drive my thinking makes all the

2158
02:12:46,101 --> 02:12:51,050
difference. And I tell so many people
that it is a choice. It is a choice.

2159
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:55,190
You can choose to be a victim and to
feel sorry for yourself or you can choose

2160
02:12:55,191 --> 02:12:58,730
to be a victor and drive forward even
if you don't believe it in the moment.

2161
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:03,860
It doesn't matter, you know, say it,
live it and start driving forward.

2162
02:13:03,861 --> 02:13:08,240
And that belief will catch fire within
you and everybody else around you.

2163
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:13,510
No doubt about it, man. And, and the,

2164
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:18,260
the unfortunate opposite that is when you
start allowing yourself to be negative

2165
02:13:18,261 --> 02:13:22,100
and you start listening to people that
want to be negative and be in drag you

2166
02:13:22,101 --> 02:13:26,480
down, you can easily had had
yourself in that direction as well.

2167
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:30,230
So when you make the choice and make
a decision on which one of those two

2168
02:13:30,231 --> 02:13:32,160
directions you want to move

2169
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:37,080
in, up or down, we recommend you move up,

2170
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:42,060
move forward. Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, later that spring,

2171
02:13:42,061 --> 02:13:46,400
Eric and I went out to eat at a local
outback steak house to celebrate the on

2172
02:13:46,401 --> 02:13:47,820
wiring of my jaw.

2173
02:13:48,450 --> 02:13:51,660
They'd been almost seven months
since I've been able to chew food.

2174
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:55,980
I was still underweight and confined
to wheelchair because the grass,

2175
02:13:55,981 --> 02:14:00,330
but we both needed a night out. I just,
you know, I, when I was reading this book,

2176
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:04,260
um, I was like eating
something, whatever, you know,

2177
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:08,460
and it's just one of those things that
we all take for granted every single day.

2178
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:09,683
And you know,

2179
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:14,750
I've had multiple prisoners of
war on this podcast and you know,

2180
02:14:15,030 --> 02:14:18,180
they're eating a bowl of rice once a day
or ball of rice walked twice a day that

2181
02:14:18,181 --> 02:14:22,170
has chips of wood in it for three years,
for six years.

2182
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:26,910
And here you are. You know,
you're not in a prisoner of war,

2183
02:14:26,911 --> 02:14:30,270
but something as simple as eating a steak.

2184
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:34,170
And that really like hit me
hard because as you know,

2185
02:14:34,171 --> 02:14:38,970
I take stakes very seriously and, and to,
to think that like verse seven months,

2186
02:14:38,971 --> 02:14:41,700
no steak and the daily things.

2187
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:46,560
And that always gets me thinking about
the daily things that when I talked to my

2188
02:14:46,561 --> 02:14:50,400
friends that have been wounded,
it's like it's the daily,

2189
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:53,340
every day things. And
as matter of fact, uh,

2190
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:58,560
when we had Jim Webb on and he was
talking about one of his friends that had

2191
02:14:58,561 --> 02:15:02,210
been wounded in Vietnam and he's like,
that's the daily current.

2192
02:15:02,211 --> 02:15:04,530
Like that guy was courageous in Vietnam,

2193
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:07,410
but he's courageous every single day,

2194
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:09,750
takes him x amount of
time to get up out of bed,

2195
02:15:09,751 --> 02:15:11,700
takes them x amount of time
to get his prosthetics.

2196
02:15:11,701 --> 02:15:15,150
It takes them x amount of time to do
normal functions that people can normally

2197
02:15:15,151 --> 02:15:15,900
do easily.

2198
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:18,510
He's got a struggle with them all and
he does it every single day without

2199
02:15:18,511 --> 02:15:21,120
complaining.
Daily courage.

2200
02:15:21,180 --> 02:15:24,120
And so just thinking about
you and that situation, man.

2201
02:15:26,370 --> 02:15:27,203
Awesome.

2202
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:31,770
I flew to Chicago almost once a month
to preparation for my first surgery with

2203
02:15:31,771 --> 02:15:33,840
Dr. Walton,
which had scheduled for July.

2204
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:36,630
The airports and their crowds
continued to be a tournament.

2205
02:15:36,830 --> 02:15:39,900
Little kids pointed at me and called
to their mothers to look at me too.

2206
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:41,490
People refuse to talk to me.

2207
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:44,820
They'd act ashamed or embarrassed
or they'd set expressions,

2208
02:15:44,821 --> 02:15:47,730
have pity on their faces internally.
I raged at them.

2209
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:52,910
Are these the people I sacrificed for
coming back from a ship of coming back

2210
02:15:53,281 --> 02:15:56,850
from Chicago on one trip,
I just broke everyone who stared at me.

2211
02:15:56,851 --> 02:16:00,930
I treated with a sudden boom.
By the end of the trip though,

2212
02:16:00,931 --> 02:16:04,380
I realized I needed to do something
different or the bitterness would eat me

2213
02:16:04,381 --> 02:16:06,870
alive. It gave me a thought.
I came up with an idea.

2214
02:16:06,871 --> 02:16:10,350
I went online and designed a couple t
shirts. The first one said, stop staring.

2215
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:13,530
I got shot by a machine gun.
It would have killed you.

2216
02:16:14,190 --> 02:16:18,870
I put an American flag on the back
and called the wounded were so

2217
02:16:20,730 --> 02:16:22,620
are you still making
the wounded wear shirts?

2218
02:16:22,650 --> 02:16:26,740
So what do wears on pause for right
now, but it will be coming back. So we,

2219
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:31,420
we've got some work, we're getting
things online in 2019 but a yeah.

2220
02:16:31,421 --> 02:16:34,720
A lot of people have asked me when
it will come back. It will be back,

2221
02:16:34,721 --> 02:16:39,010
I assure you. Yeah. So
this podcast is eternal.

2222
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:43,570
So most likely when people are listening
to this, it is live. Do you get it?

2223
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:47,730
You can get your wounded wear t
shirt. That's right. Uh, yeah. The,

2224
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:49,000
you were talking about that,

2225
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:54,030
that sign and that sign got
so much attention and was so,

2226
02:16:54,170 --> 02:16:56,890
uh,
so impactful to so many people.

2227
02:16:57,010 --> 02:16:59,530
You ended up going to the Oval Office.

2228
02:16:59,531 --> 02:17:02,950
You ended up meeting President
Bush with your family. Um,

2229
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:07,540
and then you ended up coming
back to the White House again.

2230
02:17:07,541 --> 02:17:10,150
And we're going back to the book.
I went to Mike [inaudible] stores,

2231
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:19,470
metal of honor ceremony in the White House
that April Mike was a fellow seal who

2232
02:17:20,021 --> 02:17:24,220
had jumped on her hand grenade,
thrown onto a rooftop. He had

2233
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:26,873
okay.

2234
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:31,020
And saved two of his teammates
in a firefight in Ramadi.

2235
02:17:31,650 --> 02:17:36,540
He shielded his brother's with his own
body and paid the ultimate price for that

2236
02:17:36,541 --> 02:17:37,374
devotion.

2237
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,083
Okay.

2238
02:17:39,090 --> 02:17:43,330
It was deeply moving to be there to see
Mike's Family receive his posthumous

2239
02:17:43,370 --> 02:17:46,290
metal of honor.
But while I was there,

2240
02:17:46,291 --> 02:17:48,390
I met another seal named Ryan job.

2241
02:17:49,290 --> 02:17:54,290
He'd been part of the team three and
had served with legendary sniper,

2242
02:17:54,901 --> 02:17:58,140
Chris Kyle in Iraq.
During the 2006 campaign,

2243
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:02,910
Ryan had been a mark 48 machine gunner
for the team and during a firefight that

2244
02:18:02,911 --> 02:18:06,270
spring of bullet had struck his weapon,
then hit him in the face,

2245
02:18:06,271 --> 02:18:07,530
destroying his right eye.

2246
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:12,240
He survived and reached Bethesda
much as I would a year later,

2247
02:18:12,241 --> 02:18:15,690
but nerve damage cost him
his vision in his left die.

2248
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:20,760
The prospect of spending the rest of his
life blind had to have been terrifying

2249
02:18:21,630 --> 02:18:26,130
though he never showed it. Instead, he
announced that if he had to be blind,

2250
02:18:26,370 --> 02:18:29,640
he would be the best
damn blind man there was.

2251
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:34,570
So that's where I met
you for the first time.

2252
02:18:34,690 --> 02:18:39,690
Obviously a Mikey and Ryan and Chris
were all with me and task you to bruiser

2253
02:18:40,030 --> 02:18:41,500
and you came out for the,

2254
02:18:41,590 --> 02:18:46,270
for the medal of honor ceremony for Mikey.

2255
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:50,230
And I actually remember
looking at you guys, you know,

2256
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:53,500
looking at you guys talking to each other
and I actually thought I had pictures

2257
02:18:53,501 --> 02:18:54,550
of it but I didn't,

2258
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:58,450
I thought I had pictures of Youtube
talking but I didn't have any pictures.

2259
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:00,130
But it was,

2260
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:05,530
it was a crazy to sit there and look at
both you guys that have been, you know,

2261
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:09,880
both men shot. Unfortunately Ryan,
you know, he lost vision in both eyes,

2262
02:19:09,881 --> 02:19:14,881
which obviously could have happened
to you very easily and thank God,

2263
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:19,840
you know, it didn't, um, and
you guys kind of, you know,

2264
02:19:20,110 --> 02:19:23,600
I guess when you have getting shot in
the head and calm and you guys be Kinda

2265
02:19:23,630 --> 02:19:26,290
became Bros and uh,
continue on here.

2266
02:19:26,290 --> 02:19:29,510
Ryan and I bumped each other on multiple
occasions over the next several months.

2267
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:33,220
On one of the occasions Ryan had come
out to the east coast seal teams for

2268
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:36,290
wounded warrior,
a Benevolent Organization conference.

2269
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:40,400
As we made small talk
and met different people.

2270
02:19:40,430 --> 02:19:43,130
I Ryan and another CEO who
had been shot in the eye,

2271
02:19:43,131 --> 02:19:47,600
we're joking around and came up with the
idea for a club for seals who had been

2272
02:19:47,601 --> 02:19:50,870
shot in the head.
It was a very small club.

2273
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:55,850
We decided to call the club
Shit seals hit in the head.

2274
02:19:56,990 --> 02:20:00,980
We unanimously voted on our motto.
This club sucks.

2275
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:08,710
So yeah.
Um,

2276
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:13,400
just to pretty awesome. And
that's pretty much the, you know,

2277
02:20:13,460 --> 02:20:18,460
that's definitely Ryan biggles job's
attitude was he was just going to have a,

2278
02:20:19,170 --> 02:20:23,270
an awesome time all the time,
regardless of what situation he was in.

2279
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:27,980
He was gonna, he was gonna
get after it and um, yeah,

2280
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:31,120
it was cool to see you guys meet. Yeah.
Hey, Ryan was awesome and you know,

2281
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:32,440
he was ahead of it.

2282
02:20:32,441 --> 02:20:36,860
It was interesting because
the reconstruction process
that they were doing with

2283
02:20:36,861 --> 02:20:38,930
me,
it was the same they were doing with Ryan.

2284
02:20:38,931 --> 02:20:41,630
And obviously I was
blessed to keep my vision,

2285
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:43,940
although they were fixing
things with this. Right.

2286
02:20:43,941 --> 02:20:48,080
I so often I'd call him and
I'd be like, Hey, you know,

2287
02:20:48,081 --> 02:20:51,080
you had this done. How'd it
go? You know, what did you do?

2288
02:20:51,081 --> 02:20:53,720
Do you have any recommendations?
Like anything, you know,

2289
02:20:53,721 --> 02:20:57,620
you go to the people who have experienced,
so Ryan and I got close through that.

2290
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:01,640
Yeah. Just kind of learning
from him. One of the, this,

2291
02:21:01,641 --> 02:21:04,820
this was another bit of a,
of a surprise to me. Again,

2292
02:21:04,821 --> 02:21:09,710
this is the kind of thing that I never
had to think about, but he, here you go,

2293
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:11,240
going back to book.
In the months that followed,

2294
02:21:11,241 --> 02:21:12,860
I knew that I was in for the long game,

2295
02:21:12,861 --> 02:21:16,160
the slog through surgeries and
setbacks and tenured. And again,

2296
02:21:16,161 --> 02:21:20,840
you got to read this book to
realize the absolute just medical,

2297
02:21:20,910 --> 02:21:22,710
uh,
uh,

2298
02:21:23,210 --> 02:21:26,870
medical trauma that you're
going through day in, day out.

2299
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:30,920
And this really drove it home to me. I
called it medical budge. There you go.

2300
02:21:30,921 --> 02:21:33,440
That's really what it will.
Medical Buds. And here's,

2301
02:21:33,441 --> 02:21:36,560
here's one thing that just
hit me like a ton of bricks.

2302
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:38,450
By the summer of 2009,

2303
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:43,340
I was starting to run low on the
available patches of skin for grafting.

2304
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:47,600
My body was roping the scars from
surgical sites and over a dozen,

2305
02:21:47,660 --> 02:21:51,530
a dozen graphs. That to
me, I'm thinking of myself,

2306
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:56,060
I mean you're running out
of skin to graph to, to,

2307
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:58,760
to do damn two,
do a damage repair to your face.

2308
02:21:59,750 --> 02:22:01,280
What is that process like?

2309
02:22:02,030 --> 02:22:06,370
So a lot of times they harvest
the skin from, you know,

2310
02:22:06,371 --> 02:22:08,510
your thighs and areas and,
and it,

2311
02:22:08,511 --> 02:22:10,970
and it wasn't that I was
just running out of skin,

2312
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,290
they were running out of skin cause I've
got quite a few tattoos so my back is

2313
02:22:15,291 --> 02:22:18,980
totally tattooed, you know,
uh, you know, top of my arms.

2314
02:22:19,310 --> 02:22:21,410
So that's what the problem was becoming,

2315
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:24,620
putting tattooed skin on other
parts of your bodies. No big deal.

2316
02:22:24,621 --> 02:22:26,070
They could have cut that in a second,

2317
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:28,790
but obviously they were
like, you know, we did the,

2318
02:22:28,791 --> 02:22:32,280
I did not want to put
tattooed skin on my face. Um,

2319
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,610
so that's where we were
starting to run into issues.

2320
02:22:35,611 --> 02:22:40,050
And this really is something that a
lot of people don't understand with,

2321
02:22:40,051 --> 02:22:45,051
with battlefield injuries is they're
super dirty bombs or dirty bullets are

2322
02:22:45,961 --> 02:22:49,410
dirty and you fall in the soil.

2323
02:22:49,411 --> 02:22:52,470
And you bleed into the soil
overseas and that's nerdy.

2324
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:56,340
So the vast majority of
wounded warriors come home,

2325
02:22:56,370 --> 02:23:00,390
especially from this war,
uh, with infection problems.

2326
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:03,090
And there's so many guys,
myself included,

2327
02:23:03,091 --> 02:23:06,720
that it's not your initial injuries
that are as devastating. I mean,

2328
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:09,690
obviously there's levels of devastation,
but for so many of us,

2329
02:23:09,691 --> 02:23:10,950
it's the infection problems.

2330
02:23:11,130 --> 02:23:14,760
So many guys come back with their limbs
and ended up losing their limbs because

2331
02:23:14,761 --> 02:23:19,730
of the infection. I had major infection
problems, which caused us to continue,

2332
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:21,390
have to do more and more graphs.

2333
02:23:21,391 --> 02:23:25,470
They would have to cut out what they had
done because it was infected and failed.

2334
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:29,610
Um, they rebuilt my nose three
times. Uh, so the first two,

2335
02:23:29,611 --> 02:23:31,770
they had a totally cut out and start over.

2336
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:35,490
So that's why we were starting to
run into issues. Hey, where do we,

2337
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:39,030
where do we get more cartilage?
Where do we get more skin? Um,

2338
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:44,490
they can use cadaver, but it does not.
It does not last. It doesn't always take.

2339
02:23:44,491 --> 02:23:46,800
So they always want to use your own body.

2340
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:49,800
And that's where we
started to run into issues.

2341
02:23:56,780 --> 02:23:59,690
September 24th,
2009

2342
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:03,350
Ryan job is dead.

2343
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:08,400
I hadn't known Ryan incredibly well.
I wouldn't call him a close friend.

2344
02:24:08,401 --> 02:24:10,020
We talked on the phone occasionally.

2345
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:14,910
We shared a common experience
and discussed our notes
on recovery and we shared

2346
02:24:14,911 --> 02:24:18,130
a twisted sense of humor,
but above all,

2347
02:24:18,131 --> 02:24:20,620
I respected his spirit
and relentless energy,

2348
02:24:20,621 --> 02:24:23,590
recapture all he could out of life.

2349
02:24:24,970 --> 02:24:28,570
He made the most of every
moment and achieved things.

2350
02:24:28,571 --> 02:24:33,070
Most people with their
eyesight intact never would.

2351
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:36,790
In 2008 he climbed Mount Rainier.
When I heard about that,

2352
02:24:36,791 --> 02:24:38,470
I was blown away in
the climbing community.

2353
02:24:38,471 --> 02:24:42,490
That 14,000 foot volcanic mountain in
Washington state is considered one of the

2354
02:24:42,491 --> 02:24:46,990
most difficult to summit in all North
America. It has deadly crevices,

2355
02:24:46,991 --> 02:24:49,300
narrow ledges,
and glacial ice.

2356
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:52,300
It is as technical climb as you can find.

2357
02:24:52,330 --> 02:24:56,410
Mount Rainier claims on
average three lives a year of
those who aspire to summit,

2358
02:24:57,580 --> 02:25:02,290
and Ryan made it to the top
two years after that bullet
robbed him of his vision.

2359
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:05,800
He and Kelly,
who he had married,

2360
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:08,320
he and Kelly were getting ready
to have a daughter together.

2361
02:25:09,190 --> 02:25:10,900
Ryan had started a new life,

2362
02:25:11,470 --> 02:25:16,390
found a fresh path to blaze and
had built something from the ruins.

2363
02:25:17,110 --> 02:25:20,290
He really was being the best
damn blind man out there.

2364
02:25:21,580 --> 02:25:24,670
Then with the snap cosmic fingers,

2365
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:27,520
it was all stolen from him.

2366
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:29,960
Okay.

2367
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:31,670
And if you don't know the story,

2368
02:25:31,671 --> 02:25:35,450
there was what he went through one of
his many surgeries cause he was still

2369
02:25:35,451 --> 02:25:40,451
going through surgeries and after the
surgery there was complications and

2370
02:25:43,850 --> 02:25:46,910
he,
he died as well.

2371
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:55,550
They killed him. I mean they matched up.
Yeah. There was, there was overdose Tam.

2372
02:25:55,551 --> 02:26:00,510
That was a total mistake.
And that slayed me. Um,

2373
02:26:01,070 --> 02:26:03,350
Ryan's death rocked me.
Um,

2374
02:26:07,730 --> 02:26:12,730
because I know how hard it is to stay
positive and to drive forward despite

2375
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:17,600
these really hard
injuries. And, uh, and it,

2376
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:22,490
it just, it killed me
to know that, you know,

2377
02:26:22,580 --> 02:26:26,090
it was a medical mistake that
killed him. You know, I mean,

2378
02:26:26,091 --> 02:26:29,780
it's hard enough to go through all this
and you survived battle and you know,

2379
02:26:29,781 --> 02:26:34,040
all these things. Yeah. So that, that,

2380
02:26:34,041 --> 02:26:38,240
um,
that really shook me when Ryan had died

2381
02:26:39,470 --> 02:26:43,280
and you're still looking at
unknown numbers of surgeries ahead.

2382
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:46,630
And it at the time, yeah,
I was halfway through.

2383
02:26:46,690 --> 02:26:48,460
So this was 2009.

2384
02:26:48,550 --> 02:26:52,870
I ended up having surgeries all
the way up until 2011. Yeah. And,

2385
02:26:52,871 --> 02:26:56,620
and the other thing that was
crazy about Ryan was, um,

2386
02:26:56,830 --> 02:27:00,400
I'm not going to say he was
out of the woods. I mean,

2387
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:05,320
but he was pretty damn far out of
the woods and that's why, you know,

2388
02:27:05,321 --> 02:27:09,790
to lose him like that was just
a fucking nightmare. Yeah.

2389
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:23,880
You at this point you still want to get
back to the teams and you're trying to

2390
02:27:27,911 --> 02:27:32,911
get your arm fixed to the point where
you can have enough mobility in it too

2391
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:39,500
to change magazines to
operate your weapon.

2392
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:42,890
So you're going to a bunch of
different people trying to see who is,

2393
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:47,570
who can make this happen. You
finally find a guy that's, you know,

2394
02:27:47,630 --> 02:27:52,160
you think you have a good lead on
somebody that can make this happen and he,

2395
02:27:52,161 --> 02:27:55,200
you go to see him and he says,
going back to the book, Jay,

2396
02:27:55,201 --> 02:27:58,370
I'm going to be frank with you. If you
were my son, I wouldn't let you do this.

2397
02:27:58,580 --> 02:28:00,920
What you have now is the
best possible outcome.

2398
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:03,140
If you proceed and have another surgery,

2399
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:06,920
you'll probably lose some of the
range of motion you have now. Worse,

2400
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:09,920
you'll set yourself up for
a lifetime of chronic pain.

2401
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:12,153
Okay.

2402
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:17,160
The drive home was a quiet one for me
as I deliberated whether or not to roll

2403
02:28:18,581 --> 02:28:20,020
the dice one last time.

2404
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:23,600
By the time I turned off the
freeway in for Virginia Beach,

2405
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:28,730
I knew it was not worth the risk.
My days as an operator, we're over.

2406
02:28:30,260 --> 02:28:34,940
Part of me always suspected this
might happen. This might happen now.

2407
02:28:34,970 --> 02:28:35,900
It was confirmed.

2408
02:28:36,590 --> 02:28:41,330
I had no epiphany's during the drive home
about what to do now as the that dream

2409
02:28:41,331 --> 02:28:45,500
to kick doors again slipped away.
What would I do?

2410
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,400
How would I support my family?
I didn't have any answers,

2411
02:28:49,580 --> 02:28:54,580
but I knew one thing I'd lived as Ryan
job had honor his memory and never take

2412
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:59,240
another day for granted.

2413
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:15,650
Ryan's death reminded me that
nothing is guaranteed in life.

2414
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:18,470
They can be taken away in a heartbeat.

2415
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:23,990
The life you've built with everything
you've got can come apart in an instant

2416
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:27,410
from circumstances far
beyond your control.

2417
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:33,700
You either adapt and overcome or you
become a casualty of those twists of fate.

2418
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:37,930
I refused to be a casualty.

2419
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:47,290
So you get this news that,

2420
02:29:49,630 --> 02:29:52,630
hey, you're not either, we can't do
this. This is what you got. What?

2421
02:29:52,631 --> 02:29:54,520
You got this where you're at.

2422
02:29:55,390 --> 02:30:00,390
And the idea of getting back
operational again is gone.

2423
02:30:03,250 --> 02:30:06,220
And it's funny, you and I were
just talking about, you know,

2424
02:30:06,221 --> 02:30:09,940
you were a over talking to some students
at Bud's and you had a guy that was,

2425
02:30:10,750 --> 02:30:13,940
was, but what have you
been injured? Older guy,

2426
02:30:13,941 --> 02:30:16,450
you said it wasn't real to come back
and yeah, he's medically dropped,

2427
02:30:16,451 --> 02:30:18,550
medically dropped,
not going to be able to come back.

2428
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:23,760
And so dream is gone and it's interesting
you're talking to him and you'd been

2429
02:30:24,251 --> 02:30:26,920
through it,
been through it,

2430
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:31,870
and your attitude was
okay when we can do now.

2431
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:34,420
Okay.

2432
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:37,640
And, and like I told him,
I mean, so you know, this,

2433
02:30:37,641 --> 02:30:42,620
this idea of life ambushes, uh, I told
him, I said, you just stepped into one.

2434
02:30:43,070 --> 02:30:46,810
And uh, there, there are
small ones and big ones. Um,

2435
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:50,960
a lot of times they're totally unexpected,

2436
02:30:50,961 --> 02:30:54,500
but the reality is most ambushes
aren't totally unexpected.

2437
02:30:54,501 --> 02:30:57,680
There are indicators that we
see before we ever get into it,

2438
02:30:57,710 --> 02:30:59,630
whether we're aware of seeing them or not.

2439
02:30:59,631 --> 02:31:03,530
Sometimes it's after the fact that we
look back nine 11 is a good example of

2440
02:31:03,531 --> 02:31:08,510
there were indicators that
we missed before nine 11
happened. Uh, for us as seals,

2441
02:31:08,511 --> 02:31:12,890
when we move into areas
we know that's a bad area.

2442
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:16,790
We are in an area where we're getting
channelized there's high ground above us.

2443
02:31:16,791 --> 02:31:21,540
This would be a good area
to execute an um, you know,

2444
02:31:21,541 --> 02:31:22,380
for me,

2445
02:31:22,710 --> 02:31:26,970
I had seen those indicators coming
so I kind of knew one was coming.

2446
02:31:26,971 --> 02:31:30,240
I had met so many doctors who said,
um,

2447
02:31:30,270 --> 02:31:34,650
literally the doctor from Johns Hopkins
who put my arm back together, um,

2448
02:31:34,710 --> 02:31:39,210
they actually wrote a medical journal
about what he did with my elbow. Um,

2449
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:44,010
I mean he successfully reconstructed and
elbow that had been totally destroyed

2450
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:48,330
and it was always funny to me. There's
an arrogance and I think there has to be,

2451
02:31:48,331 --> 02:31:51,420
there has to be a little bit level of
Aaron and arrogance and confidence and

2452
02:31:51,421 --> 02:31:53,190
high level orthopedic surgeon.

2453
02:31:53,191 --> 02:31:56,100
So every time I'd go meet one of
these guys they'd be like, Oh yeah,

2454
02:31:56,101 --> 02:31:57,150
I can fix your arm.

2455
02:31:57,750 --> 02:32:01,560
And then they slap that
ray up and I'd watch,

2456
02:32:01,561 --> 02:32:05,370
it was like the air got sucked out of
the room as they looked at it and then

2457
02:32:05,371 --> 02:32:09,720
they would look at me and they'd say,
yeah man, I'm sorry. I, they're like,

2458
02:32:09,721 --> 02:32:12,210
I don't even know how your
arms work in the way it is.

2459
02:32:12,750 --> 02:32:17,550
So when I met the guy from Duke who
was one of the premier, you know,

2460
02:32:17,551 --> 02:32:18,570
hand and arm guys,

2461
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:22,650
literally the guy that put my arm together
was probably the premier hand and arm

2462
02:32:22,651 --> 02:32:27,510
guy. And I tried to get him to go back
and do more and he said no. He said,

2463
02:32:27,511 --> 02:32:30,960
there's no way in hell.
He said your arm. He said,

2464
02:32:30,961 --> 02:32:34,680
going into your arm and you're getting
what we got is a miracle. He's like,

2465
02:32:34,710 --> 02:32:39,060
I am not going back in. And I recommended
against anybody else doing it. Well,

2466
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:43,170
I still tried to find other doctors and
it was his guy from Duke who finally

2467
02:32:43,171 --> 02:32:47,710
convinced me. So when that
moment came, I kind of knew.

2468
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:51,450
Um,
so as opposed to this young man from buds,

2469
02:32:51,451 --> 02:32:55,260
it was less unexpected than
what I stepped, you know,

2470
02:32:55,261 --> 02:33:00,120
for me it was just unexpected.
So, um, it just became,

2471
02:33:00,121 --> 02:33:03,970
where do I go from here? Um, and,

2472
02:33:04,290 --> 02:33:07,770
and interestingly enough, I had laid out
some different things for myself. One,

2473
02:33:07,771 --> 02:33:10,950
I wanted to do a 20 year career,
so that kind of became my first thing.

2474
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:15,720
Can I still stay in and finish my career?
Maybe I can't be operational.

2475
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:16,620
Um,

2476
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:21,620
at this point I was at dam neck and I
think I was at 18 years at this point.

2477
02:33:22,201 --> 02:33:23,520
So it had been four years,

2478
02:33:23,970 --> 02:33:28,530
almost four years from
my injury and a silver.

2479
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:33,300
A couple of days I talked to, I was
working in operations and I just said,

2480
02:33:33,301 --> 02:33:35,520
hey, what are our options? What can we do?

2481
02:33:35,970 --> 02:33:39,690
And they actually allowed me
to go work some new things, um,

2482
02:33:41,190 --> 02:33:44,310
different projects and different things.
So it was great.

2483
02:33:44,311 --> 02:33:47,040
They allow me to finish
what I set out to do,

2484
02:33:47,070 --> 02:33:50,220
but it also gave me a decent
amount of time at this point.

2485
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:54,660
It was another year before we started
the medical retirement process,

2486
02:33:54,661 --> 02:33:56,100
which actually took two years.

2487
02:33:56,101 --> 02:34:00,360
So it carried me to 21 years and it
gave me a lot of time to really look at,

2488
02:34:00,361 --> 02:34:03,000
you know,
where does my future go from here?

2489
02:34:03,001 --> 02:34:04,950
And to kind of lay out
what are my new passions,

2490
02:34:04,951 --> 02:34:09,180
what is my purpose and where do I go
from this life after the military?

2491
02:34:09,181 --> 02:34:13,200
What can I do with all these lessons
that I've learned and you know,

2492
02:34:13,201 --> 02:34:15,960
how do I pay it forward? How do
I honor Ryan? How do I honor?

2493
02:34:15,961 --> 02:34:20,050
And all these guys that every day I walked
by this granite wall and they didn't

2494
02:34:20,051 --> 02:34:24,430
get a choice. They didn't get
a choice to come home. So, um,

2495
02:34:25,090 --> 02:34:25,270
okay.

2496
02:34:25,270 --> 02:34:29,200
Thankfully, you know, I had that
time, it still within the community,

2497
02:34:29,201 --> 02:34:32,470
but also coming to grips
with the fact that, you know,

2498
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:37,480
like I talked to those young men about
so many people are so strongly tied to

2499
02:34:37,481 --> 02:34:39,760
what they do for a living,
uh,

2500
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:43,370
that they cannot function if suddenly
it's taken away from them. Uh,

2501
02:34:43,460 --> 02:34:45,120
there's a lot of meat,

2502
02:34:45,190 --> 02:34:50,190
a lot of police officers and firefighters
or professional athletes that if

2503
02:34:50,201 --> 02:34:54,040
suddenly their career is over, they
don't know how to function without that.

2504
02:34:54,041 --> 02:34:58,630
They've, they've tied their identities
so much around what they've done.

2505
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:00,100
And,
um,

2506
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:04,120
I realized that the lessons
that I learned in that the,

2507
02:35:04,330 --> 02:35:09,150
the seal teams and this journey that I
had been on was incredibly relatable. Um,

2508
02:35:09,151 --> 02:35:12,010
and it wasn't, had nothing to do
with tactical lessons. You know,

2509
02:35:12,011 --> 02:35:15,040
I didn't need to be the guy that got
out and taught you how to shoot or do

2510
02:35:15,041 --> 02:35:16,360
anything on that.
Like that.

2511
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:21,630
What I realized it realized is there
were amazing life lessons, the lessons,

2512
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:25,480
human lessons, lessons in leadership
and teamwork and overcoming a bursty.

2513
02:35:25,481 --> 02:35:29,140
And this idea of helping people,
you know,

2514
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:32,930
not only survive but thrive
from crisis at ambushes.

2515
02:35:33,020 --> 02:35:37,480
So that really started to become the
path that I was walking and to help other

2516
02:35:37,481 --> 02:35:38,470
wounded warriors.

2517
02:35:39,850 --> 02:35:40,683
Well,

2518
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:46,540
I just want to wrap this last little
section of the book because we're talking

2519
02:35:46,541 --> 02:35:51,010
about the identity and what you
invested your life into. And

2520
02:35:52,570 --> 02:35:54,910
you say this,
I held the try to in my hand,

2521
02:35:55,450 --> 02:36:00,340
this golden emblem had driven my life.
I focused on it. I called the did it,

2522
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:04,000
I became enamored by it.
I almost lost it,

2523
02:36:04,750 --> 02:36:08,740
and then I earned it back before
I sacrificed my body for it.

2524
02:36:10,010 --> 02:36:10,380
Okay?

2525
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:14,190
Only then did I finally understand
what it truly represented.

2526
02:36:15,060 --> 02:36:19,380
It carried the spirit of warrior
poets like Mike Murphy, Mike Monsoor,

2527
02:36:19,470 --> 02:36:23,880
and Chris Kyle. It carried the
spirit of my friends Ryan Job,

2528
02:36:24,090 --> 02:36:27,330
Adam Brown, Mike Mcgreevey, Kevin Houston,

2529
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:32,220
and the 79 other men who have made the
ultimate sacrifice for freedom and the

2530
02:36:32,221 --> 02:36:33,990
Brotherhood since nine 11

2531
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:35,810
okay.

2532
02:36:35,810 --> 02:36:38,120
I didn't know why God spared me,

2533
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:44,620
but I did know I would find a way into
the future where I would use each and

2534
02:36:45,951 --> 02:36:48,620
every day to honor my brothers.

2535
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:49,900
Yeah.

2536
02:36:49,900 --> 02:36:51,400
Who had not made it home.

2537
02:36:58,850 --> 02:36:59,683
And

2538
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:05,970
I think obviously you've done a lot to uh,
honor our brothers

2539
02:37:07,910 --> 02:37:08,743
and

2540
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:13,410
I think you continue to do that obviously
every day with what you're doing and

2541
02:37:13,440 --> 02:37:17,390
how you're doing it and how you're
taking the lessons that you learned and

2542
02:37:17,420 --> 02:37:21,680
bringing them to two more people
spreading the word broadly.

2543
02:37:22,610 --> 02:37:23,443
Um,

2544
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:30,170
what did that translation transition
look like? Like the, you know,

2545
02:37:30,171 --> 02:37:33,640
from the time you got out into
where you are now because you know,

2546
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:37,790
I mean obviously everyone that's
in the military right now, one day,

2547
02:37:37,791 --> 02:37:39,320
I hate to break the news to y'all.

2548
02:37:39,350 --> 02:37:44,330
One day you're going to be not in the
military anymore. Bring us from, you know,

2549
02:37:44,331 --> 02:37:48,340
the end of your career into where you are
now and where your focus right now and

2550
02:37:48,570 --> 02:37:50,480
what you're doing. Yeah, absolutely.

2551
02:37:50,481 --> 02:37:52,760
I think that transition is
a lot harder than people.

2552
02:37:52,810 --> 02:37:57,580
I realize, I think a lot of things,
I'm sure you experienced this,

2553
02:37:57,910 --> 02:38:02,230
we take for granted the level of
structure that exists in the military and

2554
02:38:02,231 --> 02:38:05,020
suddenly you get out in this
feeling world and that's not there.

2555
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:08,160
I was a little bit fortunate
enough that I had launched, uh,

2556
02:38:08,180 --> 02:38:12,760
the nonprofit when you were a later to
become the combat wounded coalition while

2557
02:38:12,761 --> 02:38:16,360
I was still on active duty.
But, uh, so when I got out,

2558
02:38:16,361 --> 02:38:18,340
that kind of became my focus.
Got It.

2559
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:23,400
I will say that I made the mistake that
a lot of military members and especially

2560
02:38:24,281 --> 02:38:28,570
special operations members make when
they get out. I tried to do everything.

2561
02:38:29,110 --> 02:38:34,110
Everything I saw was an opportunity
that I didn't want to lose out on and I

2562
02:38:34,150 --> 02:38:37,990
falsely can convince myself, yeah,
I have the ability to do that.

2563
02:38:38,260 --> 02:38:41,590
So running the nonprofit, we did
a lot of amazing things, you know,

2564
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:45,940
two and a half million dollars. We
help thousands of wounded warriors, um,

2565
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,580
even created a,

2566
02:38:47,620 --> 02:38:51,700
a program specifically to help
them to employers build structure,

2567
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:55,090
find their new passion.
But what I started to realize,

2568
02:38:55,091 --> 02:38:58,510
and I was doing all this while I was
still trying to speak and develop content

2569
02:38:58,511 --> 02:39:03,070
and work on things, uh, and take care of
a family and kids and all these things,

2570
02:39:03,550 --> 02:39:07,500
and I kind of had an epiphany in
2018 I'd been doing this, you know,

2571
02:39:07,620 --> 02:39:12,350
I had retired in 2013 so five years
I had been doing this. And uh,

2572
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:14,050
I suddenly realized,

2573
02:39:15,430 --> 02:39:19,930
you've got to find that one thing that
you truly are going to make a difference

2574
02:39:19,931 --> 02:39:23,650
at.
And I took a step back in 2018 and said,

2575
02:39:23,651 --> 02:39:27,460
where can I have the most impact
and what really is my new mission?

2576
02:39:27,670 --> 02:39:31,810
What drives my passion? Where
is my destination? Where am I,

2577
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:35,380
where am I going to set that course to
go? And I realized, I look back, you know,

2578
02:39:35,381 --> 02:39:37,390
we were doing a lot of great
things with the nonprofit,

2579
02:39:37,630 --> 02:39:40,420
but there's 43,000 veteran
nonprofits out there.

2580
02:39:40,730 --> 02:39:44,560
We are losing more guys
to suicide right now. Uh,

2581
02:39:44,770 --> 02:39:48,400
then we lost to the
enemy. And I said, okay,

2582
02:39:48,401 --> 02:39:51,160
so one option is you go create
a whole nother nonprofit.

2583
02:39:51,161 --> 02:39:53,950
But there's a lot of good ones out there.
And I think that's part of the problem.

2584
02:39:53,951 --> 02:39:58,030
It's diluting some of the
message. So I said, maybe

2585
02:39:59,020 --> 02:40:01,850
I'm better off focusing on,
uh,

2586
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:06,850
helping a whole bunch of people with this
message and lending my support suit to

2587
02:40:06,851 --> 02:40:08,080
another organization.

2588
02:40:08,081 --> 02:40:11,800
So myself and the board made the decision
that we were going to phase down our

2589
02:40:11,801 --> 02:40:14,790
organization in 2000 and 2019.

2590
02:40:14,791 --> 02:40:19,500
Made that shift that I'm totally focusing
on delivering this content to help

2591
02:40:19,501 --> 02:40:22,950
people overcome adversity,
to,

2592
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:28,340
to launch themselves out of
failure and to not only survive,

2593
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:32,370
which some people just survive from
these life ambushes from these massive

2594
02:40:32,371 --> 02:40:34,890
catastrophic events,
but to thrive from them,

2595
02:40:34,891 --> 02:40:39,780
to use them as a launch point
to get better. Uh, and to
understand how to do that.

2596
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:42,630
Cause I realized, man, you know, this,

2597
02:40:42,631 --> 02:40:46,470
you've written all this amazing content
on it and all that is coming into the

2598
02:40:46,471 --> 02:40:51,420
second book that'll come out in
December called overcome. So,

2599
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:52,080
uh,

2600
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:56,430
I have online courses that are getting
ready to come on board here in the next

2601
02:40:56,430 --> 02:40:56,460
couple of months.

2602
02:40:56,460 --> 02:40:59,970
And I just want to get out there and help
as many people as I can and then lend

2603
02:40:59,971 --> 02:41:04,140
myself to some of the organizations
that are out there that are helping. Uh,

2604
02:41:04,141 --> 02:41:09,141
R W we're specifically with posttraumatic
stress and traumatic brain injuries.

2605
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:12,720
One of the things I've started doing a
lot of research and what we're beginning

2606
02:41:12,721 --> 02:41:14,460
to understand is,
um,

2607
02:41:14,730 --> 02:41:19,500
I used to think that if we could help guys
find a new purpose after they got out,

2608
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:22,050
it would help solve their problems.
Wounded Warriors.

2609
02:41:22,530 --> 02:41:26,250
But what we're beginning to
understand is that we have never,

2610
02:41:27,210 --> 02:41:31,050
the way we train now and the way we
have fought wars is exposing guys,

2611
02:41:31,051 --> 02:41:33,670
especially on frontline
combat units and special ops,

2612
02:41:34,230 --> 02:41:39,200
special operation units to level
of blasts that we've never in,

2613
02:41:39,250 --> 02:41:41,730
in,
in up until this point.

2614
02:41:41,731 --> 02:41:45,030
And the way we trained in the military
we haven't done before. So, I mean,

2615
02:41:45,031 --> 02:41:48,720
you look at our breachers and how
many blasts we exposed them to just in

2616
02:41:48,721 --> 02:41:52,260
training. Yep. Um, and what
we're starting to see, I mean,

2617
02:41:52,261 --> 02:41:56,940
I've had multiple friends now that have
killed themselves, who I said, no way,

2618
02:41:56,970 --> 02:41:57,840
no way.

2619
02:41:58,410 --> 02:42:02,580
And I've watched these downward slides
and what we're starting to find out is we

2620
02:42:02,581 --> 02:42:07,560
are creating physiological impacts on
the brain from these continued exposures

2621
02:42:07,561 --> 02:42:11,160
to these blasts. So we need more
research. We need, you know,

2622
02:42:11,190 --> 02:42:14,940
we need more non pharmacological
solutions to these problems.

2623
02:42:14,941 --> 02:42:18,330
And there's a lot of things that are
out there that are on the forefront.

2624
02:42:18,990 --> 02:42:20,490
So one of the things with research,

2625
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:23,550
I started doing some stuff with
the concussion legacy foundation,

2626
02:42:23,551 --> 02:42:26,340
which is the same group working
with the NFL or you know,

2627
02:42:26,430 --> 02:42:29,430
highlighting the impact
of CTE on NFL players.

2628
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:34,700
And we're beginning to realize that some
of our special operations guys like Rob

2629
02:42:35,670 --> 02:42:38,100
Guso who took his life severe CTE,

2630
02:42:38,370 --> 02:42:41,250
but what they figured out
is it's different. Uh,

2631
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:44,400
some of the premier premier neurologists
that are out there and figuring out,

2632
02:42:44,401 --> 02:42:45,930
it's different.
It's a,

2633
02:42:46,570 --> 02:42:50,730
it's blast and the blast goes all the
way through the brain as opposed to a

2634
02:42:50,731 --> 02:42:54,450
concussion that creates an impact.
And there's a centralized location.

2635
02:42:54,451 --> 02:42:59,010
Now for guys or even gals out there
that I've had multiple concussions that

2636
02:42:59,011 --> 02:43:02,220
creates more. But the bottom
line is we need this research.

2637
02:43:02,221 --> 02:43:06,690
So I donated my brain to the concussion
legacy foundation and I'm encouraging

2638
02:43:06,691 --> 02:43:09,570
all the veterans that are out there.
If you have been in combat,

2639
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:13,170
donate your brain. You need it. I get it.

2640
02:43:13,390 --> 02:43:16,870
You don't need it when you're gone and
they're not going to come early and

2641
02:43:16,871 --> 02:43:19,400
collect, you know. But, uh,

2642
02:43:19,480 --> 02:43:23,230
the bottom line is it is an amazing way
to be able to give back to the veterans

2643
02:43:23,231 --> 02:43:28,231
that are coming up behind you because
they don't have enough veteran brains in

2644
02:43:28,421 --> 02:43:31,690
the brain banks that are out there to
understand the kind of trauma we're

2645
02:43:31,691 --> 02:43:34,970
putting on our brains.
And until they, and, and,

2646
02:43:34,980 --> 02:43:39,390
and obviously they can't study the
brains while we're still alive. So if,

2647
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:41,650
if you want a way to give back,

2648
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:45,460
look up the concussion legacy foundation
and donate your brain, I did it.

2649
02:43:45,490 --> 02:43:47,650
We need the research 2030 years from now,

2650
02:43:47,651 --> 02:43:51,700
we can make a difference to save some
young warrior that's out there that got

2651
02:43:51,701 --> 02:43:56,701
exposed to blast and now can't figure
out why his world is falling apart around

2652
02:43:57,161 --> 02:44:02,080
him. So those are my passions.
That's my purpose. And A,

2653
02:44:02,081 --> 02:44:04,900
I want to help as many people out there.
I want to make you better,

2654
02:44:04,930 --> 02:44:08,740
help you thrive from adversity,
help you thrive from failure and crisis.

2655
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:10,240
And for our wounded warriors,

2656
02:44:10,270 --> 02:44:15,270
I want to help try and solve this epidemic
we're seeing in the suicides and the

2657
02:44:15,521 --> 02:44:17,590
brain trauma.
Yeah,

2658
02:44:17,640 --> 02:44:19,740
that's,
I mean that's just awesome.

2659
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:21,870
It's awesome to see you
moving forward with that.

2660
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:27,270
And I know we've been going for a while
here and that's probably a pretty good

2661
02:44:27,271 --> 02:44:30,930
place to wrap. Where do,
where can people find you?

2662
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:33,480
Where should people locate
you and when they want to,

2663
02:44:33,570 --> 02:44:35,130
when they want to hear from you?

2664
02:44:35,410 --> 02:44:38,080
Yeah, absolutely. Best Place.

02:44:50,470 --> 02:44:52,900
and Twitter.
Awesome.

2670
02:44:54,100 --> 02:44:56,830
Echo speaking to people
and making people better.

2671
02:44:57,560 --> 02:45:01,570
You have any quick recommendations on
how you know we could improve ourselves?

2672
02:45:02,170 --> 02:45:04,030
Sure. This is x Charles, by the way.

2673
02:45:04,090 --> 02:45:08,430
I have one question in ranger school
when they told you to like, all right,

2674
02:45:08,500 --> 02:45:11,110
when they asked you,
do you need your Gucci,

2675
02:45:11,770 --> 02:45:15,130
was that the thing that kind of sent you
over the head when they said the Gucci

2676
02:45:15,131 --> 02:45:15,964
thing?

2677
02:45:16,470 --> 02:45:21,000
No, I don't think it was that. I really,
it was a, it was the land Nav comments.

2678
02:45:21,001 --> 02:45:24,080
I mean, I had taught land math. So, um,

2679
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:26,850
the funny thing about
that Gucci Jacket is,

2680
02:45:26,851 --> 02:45:31,140
so the army guys were only allowed
to wear the army jacket liner. Well,

2681
02:45:31,141 --> 02:45:35,280
we didn't have those. Yeah.
And I Gucci, Patagonia,

2682
02:45:35,281 --> 02:45:39,480
I had the member of the green from these
that came. Yeah. That's what I had.

2683
02:45:39,510 --> 02:45:43,980
So every day I put that on the ranger
instructors would lose their minds.

2684
02:45:44,730 --> 02:45:45,650
And uh,

2685
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:49,770
and in the beginning I had such a bad
attitude that I just took it in a negative

2686
02:45:49,771 --> 02:45:53,280
way. But the second time I
went through it became the,

2687
02:45:53,340 --> 02:45:56,130
how often can I put this
on and spend these guys.

2688
02:45:57,300 --> 02:46:00,840
So I still have it. This, I still have it.

2689
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:05,690
Every time I pull it out of my closet,
it puts a smile on my face. Yeah. Nice.

2690
02:46:05,910 --> 02:46:10,100
What else? No, that's it for
questions. Yeah. Yeah. We
can talk about getting better

2691
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:13,730
though. Yeah. And Jay's about to
start training in Jujitsu. Boom.

2692
02:46:13,810 --> 02:46:17,270
So he's going to need a to g two G
so we need to get that hooked up.

2693
02:46:17,271 --> 02:46:19,300
Where are we going to hook
them up with a g from origin?

2694
02:46:19,370 --> 02:46:24,370
Hundred percent even 99% a hundred
percent 104 g and all made in America.

2695
02:46:25,320 --> 02:46:29,270
Okay. All right. That's all we need to
continue to grow this country. Yes sir.

2696
02:46:29,660 --> 02:46:32,150
So yeah.
Origene if you're into Jujitsu,

2697
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:34,460
getting into Jujitsu or already in Judith,

2698
02:46:34,470 --> 02:46:39,470
you want to g a new G or another geek
origin method are going to say used g I

2699
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:43,880
can get a used as a market for used gies.
No,

2700
02:46:43,930 --> 02:46:46,680
they're shit that I was going to say.
It probably depends on who wore it.

2701
02:46:46,681 --> 02:46:49,560
I guarantee there's people out
there that would love a choco gay,

2702
02:46:49,570 --> 02:46:54,290
but that gets a little weird.
Yeah. That doesn't smell good.

2703
02:46:54,890 --> 02:46:58,890
Well, yeah, maybe some, some people, maybe
if someone like lost weight or something,

2704
02:46:58,910 --> 02:47:00,900
you know,
I don't use this anymore.

2705
02:47:02,270 --> 02:47:05,870
Eventually you were out of GE or although
the new ones talking to Pete the other

2706
02:47:05,870 --> 02:47:05,930
day,

2707
02:47:05,930 --> 02:47:10,930
the amount of Geek pants or Giza
period that had been returned is like,

2708
02:47:11,660 --> 02:47:15,800
so he said, yeah, we get like
three geese back a year with some,

2709
02:47:15,850 --> 02:47:17,150
it's actually had worn something out.

2710
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:20,060
They just don't wear out out orange
and he's just do not wear out. Yeah.

2711
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:23,210
Get some of that. Yeah.
You got to like, um, yeah,

2712
02:47:23,211 --> 02:47:26,600
like if you lose weight or something
and then you don't use it anymore,

2713
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:27,860
or if you're like,

2714
02:47:27,861 --> 02:47:30,680
you get the new one and you know how
like you turn you back to the old one

2715
02:47:30,681 --> 02:47:32,600
because the new one that's
the new hotness, you know,

2716
02:47:32,790 --> 02:47:34,000
you don't really wear it anymore,

2717
02:47:34,001 --> 02:47:35,900
so he'd give it to your
friend or something like this.

2718
02:47:37,310 --> 02:47:41,550
There's that rash guards, tee shirts, uh,

2719
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:45,620
other stuff. Yeah. Supplements,
supplements, joint warfare.

2720
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:50,840
Joint warfare and Krill oil turned out
to be the most important supplements

2721
02:47:50,841 --> 02:47:52,330
there are. In my opinion, to hang.

2722
02:47:52,460 --> 02:47:55,350
He thought it was the protein
powder and the creative team.

2723
02:47:55,400 --> 02:47:57,780
That's what we thought in the
beginning. Not Anymore. Joint joint.

2724
02:47:57,781 --> 02:48:01,910
The worker hundred percent we thought
that. Yeah. Well yes, I agree.

2725
02:48:02,030 --> 02:48:07,030
We do have drone warfare coil and if you
do want protein you might as well enjoy

2726
02:48:08,361 --> 02:48:12,620
it. Yes sir. Get yourself some milk.
It's still good for you. We need protein,

2727
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:17,110
we need the protein. That's why we
have milk. Which have you tried milk?

2728
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:21,200
I have it. Okay. We're gonna get
you some milk and especially,

2729
02:48:21,290 --> 02:48:25,340
well it depends on what flavors you like.
I like mint chocolate chip.

2730
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:30,670
I am a fan of nut milk but
apparently doc Luke hates meant,

2731
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:36,560
well apparently he was going Berserker
the other day saying why would you drink

2732
02:48:36,561 --> 02:48:41,270
something that tastes like toothpaste?
Yeah. But so as it turns out some,

2733
02:48:41,380 --> 02:48:44,480
you know, to back to
another fence analogy, some,

2734
02:48:44,660 --> 02:48:49,160
it's like you either love it or you
really don't like it. As it turns out,

2735
02:48:49,161 --> 02:48:52,130
that's the situation with them. Where
we got meant peanut butter chocolate,

2736
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:56,460
the vanilla gorilla. I'm a huge fan of
peanut butter chocolate. Okay. Okay.

2737
02:48:56,461 --> 02:48:59,360
Well I do like mint chocolate.

2738
02:49:00,680 --> 02:49:04,040
I got hostile with my whole family the
other day. Well not with my whole family,

2739
02:49:04,041 --> 02:49:09,041
with my wife and my youngest
because there was no,

2740
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:13,530
I wanted some yogurt and there was no
blueberry, there was no strawberry,

2741
02:49:13,531 --> 02:49:16,760
there was no coconut, there was a
leaf vanilla. And so I started saying,

2742
02:49:16,830 --> 02:49:21,830
why would a human being
in 2019 by Vanilla Yogurt,

2743
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:24,560
like choose,

2744
02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:29,120
choose of all the I get if it comes in
the variety pack and you end up with it,

2745
02:49:29,130 --> 02:49:33,330
you understood.
But straight up selected no wrong answer.

2746
02:49:33,690 --> 02:49:35,670
So I had to get hostile,

2747
02:49:35,770 --> 02:49:39,720
super hostile and I was telling my wife
and my youngest daughter that they are

2748
02:49:39,721 --> 02:49:44,430
crazy for just liking that vanilla. They
are for sure. But at the end of the day,

2749
02:49:44,510 --> 02:49:47,280
you know, he had an understanding of
other people. They have other opinions.

2750
02:49:47,310 --> 02:49:50,670
My seems my youngest daughter,
nine years old, she makes,

2751
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:52,800
so what she does is she takes
strawberries, cuts them up,

2752
02:49:53,460 --> 02:49:57,570
and then she puts a whipped cream on
it and then she takes or your kid milk

2753
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:00,810
strawberry and sprinkles it.
Nice

2754
02:50:03,880 --> 02:50:08,370
little protein protein from.
Cool. Yeah. That's good. Oh yeah.

2755
02:50:08,371 --> 02:50:10,370
Where your kid milk does for the kids?
Right?

2756
02:50:10,430 --> 02:50:14,220
Little more formally than our adults.
I know that possibly do drink it like me.

2757
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:18,180
They sneak it to, yes sir. They do. Also,

2758
02:50:18,181 --> 02:50:21,870
if you want to represent while you're
on this path you did to working out,

2759
02:50:21,871 --> 02:50:25,860
waking up or you wake up early.
I do, however I get up at five.

2760
02:50:26,580 --> 02:50:29,730
Okay, so the up early crew,
if you're on that. Oh,

2761
02:50:29,731 --> 02:50:33,690
and you want to represent
aesthetically Jocko was a store.

2762
02:50:33,710 --> 02:50:34,950
It was called Jocko store,

2763
02:50:35,340 --> 02:50:37,950
so we go to the chocolate store.com
that's where you can get shirts,

2764
02:50:37,951 --> 02:50:42,000
discipline equals freedom.
A shirt that has jackals face on it.

2765
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:45,630
It says good backwards. It's for
you. It's a message for you anyway.

2766
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:48,610
You want to reframe very fitting
for today's story, right? Love it.

2767
02:50:48,660 --> 02:50:53,190
Looking at yourself. Yes,
adversity. That's got a
branding problem with hold on.

2768
02:50:53,191 --> 02:50:56,920
Good, good opportunity. Look forward.
Actually I liked that like for, you know,

2769
02:50:56,921 --> 02:51:00,450
cause there's a lot of different
approaches, you know, like you say,

2770
02:51:00,451 --> 02:51:03,310
get off the exit and like
look forward. Absolutely. Men,

2771
02:51:03,360 --> 02:51:05,130
you have to show the people look back,

2772
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:09,570
they look back at what they've lost and
I don't know what's going on right now

2773
02:51:09,571 --> 02:51:13,770
kind of thing, which is natural by the
way. Oh It is course. But man, yeah,

2774
02:51:13,771 --> 02:51:14,300
that's good.

2775
02:51:14,300 --> 02:51:18,090
Just long enough to assess what you
did wrong and then you move forward,

2776
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:21,600
learn some lessons and then
move forward. But yeah. So yeah,

2777
02:51:21,601 --> 02:51:24,870
if you want to represent
and go to Jacklyn, store.com
lot of cool stuff on there.

2778
02:51:24,871 --> 02:51:29,370
If you like something, get something new.
Hoodies up there. By the way, by the way,

2779
02:51:29,460 --> 02:51:33,450
are they thick, rather thick?
Okay. That's, you know,

2780
02:51:33,460 --> 02:51:35,910
that's not what I'm looking for.
Well, you know, we're making,

2781
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:38,790
I'm going to think I'm gonna call him when
I finally get the hoodies that I want.

2782
02:51:38,791 --> 02:51:43,791
Mccoll Michigan hoodies or
Minnesota hoodies for that
people main Eskimo hoodies

2783
02:51:46,210 --> 02:51:48,270
off up north,

2784
02:51:48,271 --> 02:51:51,240
north polar for tax.

2785
02:51:51,630 --> 02:51:55,500
You think they wanted that lightweight
hoodie during the polar vortex, Bro? No.

2786
02:51:55,650 --> 02:51:59,430
So I'm just saying there's like different
regions of the world so he can get

2787
02:51:59,431 --> 02:52:02,490
that align with Ferg
guarantee for 20 below

2788
02:52:04,880 --> 02:52:09,310
region that we're talking about is
coal. Yes sir. Okay. I dig it in.

2789
02:52:09,311 --> 02:52:12,110
That is a good name for it for
sure. Cool. So anyway. Yes.

2790
02:52:12,190 --> 02:52:15,430
When it gets cold you can
have hot Jocko white tea. Yes.

2791
02:52:15,490 --> 02:52:18,490
As opposed to cold Jocko
white tea company on Amazon.

2792
02:52:19,300 --> 02:52:23,290
Ever subscribed to the
podcast if you want to.

2793
02:52:23,890 --> 02:52:26,160
Don't forget about the
warrior kid podcasts. Yeah,

2794
02:52:26,340 --> 02:52:30,460
that's good on a lot of people say
that's the best podcasts for kids ever.

2795
02:52:30,810 --> 02:52:35,170
You're not a lot from kids and
here's why you feel that way.

2796
02:52:35,171 --> 02:52:38,590
You won't be wrong by the way you
feel this way because it's so simple.

2797
02:52:38,591 --> 02:52:41,740
So you're like thinking of it in terms
of Leon, when my kid listens to this,

2798
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:45,340
oh they're going to get it fully and
then you listen to it, you're like, Dang,

2799
02:52:45,490 --> 02:52:48,010
I'm kind of get into me. You
know, like it's kind of for me.

2800
02:52:48,011 --> 02:52:52,460
So that's a problem with adults,
man. We complicate every, yeah, I do.

2801
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:57,130
Yes. Yeah, that's the uh, that's
why I love the for your kid books.

2802
02:52:57,160 --> 02:53:01,000
This is a message for a 10 year old.
And guess what I've had,

2803
02:53:01,570 --> 02:53:05,800
I have many adults that say thank you
for writing that Warrior King Book Echoes

2804
02:53:05,801 --> 02:53:09,520
One of them. Another one.
Yes. Yeah. So there's that.

2805
02:53:09,521 --> 02:53:13,300
Don't forget that warrior
kid soap from young Aden,

2806
02:53:14,260 --> 02:53:17,800
13 year old warrior kid has his own
business. He's getting after it.

2807
02:53:17,830 --> 02:53:21,340
He's got goats up in central California.
He milks them.

2808
02:53:21,550 --> 02:53:24,580
You can't sell goat milk or whatever
in California cause they got all these

2809
02:53:24,581 --> 02:53:27,490
rules. So what can you do
with it? You can make soap.

2810
02:53:27,550 --> 02:53:32,440
He started making soap and his,
his motto is stay clean,

2811
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:36,340
which I paid up. Don't worry,
don't worry. And I gave it to you.

2812
02:53:36,580 --> 02:53:40,150
I'm so arrogant and egotistical,
I want to take the credit for the,

2813
02:53:40,270 --> 02:53:44,530
for the name or whatever the mantra of,
of Aiden's soap store.

2814
02:53:44,950 --> 02:53:48,430
That's messed up. That's
sows. That's weakness, right?
It's a collaborative thing.

2815
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:52,300
Youtube channel echoes makes you a
bunch of videos. Speaking of arrogant,

2816
02:53:52,570 --> 02:53:56,490
he thinks his videos are great and
he posts them on there. There you go.

2817
02:53:56,510 --> 02:54:01,120
Never demonstrated that. But yeah.
Thank you. Okay. You sure about that?

2818
02:54:01,410 --> 02:54:03,510
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

2819
02:54:06,300 --> 02:54:09,490
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes sir. Yeah.

2820
02:54:09,491 --> 02:54:13,480
Youtube does a good on the video version
of this podcast too, by the way. Check.

2821
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:13,841
You know,

2822
02:54:13,841 --> 02:54:17,250
you can see what everybody looks like if
you care about that sort of thing. Uh,

2823
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:20,280
people watch people watch the ones with
guests because they want to see what the,

2824
02:54:20,281 --> 02:54:22,240
cause they know what I look like.
They know what echo looks like.

2825
02:54:22,270 --> 02:54:24,230
They want to see what j red.
And it looks like,

2826
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:27,800
what does a man look like that
took a round through that phase.

2827
02:54:28,900 --> 02:54:32,080
At that point they stopped the
podcast and press play on Youtube.

2828
02:54:34,420 --> 02:54:39,040
See what's going on.
It is $2 million and sexiness.

2829
02:54:39,041 --> 02:54:41,980
So if you've ever wondered where
your American tax dollars went to,

2830
02:54:42,040 --> 02:54:45,790
it went to a good cause. This time
you're not quite the $6 million man.

2831
02:54:45,791 --> 02:54:47,360
You're the two magnets,
your million dollars

2832
02:54:49,610 --> 02:54:52,560
hundred per psychological warfare.
You can get that too. It'll,

2833
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:56,320
it's a little something to help you out.
Look it up on iTunes.

2834
02:54:56,380 --> 02:55:01,090
That's all we're going to say
about it. Period. Period. Period.

2835
02:55:01,550 --> 02:55:03,970
They to go, man, Jay's got
to go. All right. What?

2836
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:06,590
Maybe Jay doesn't know what psychological
warfare is. Good is what it is.

2837
02:55:07,010 --> 02:55:11,450
It's an album with tracks Jocko tracks
telling you how to get through moments of

2838
02:55:11,451 --> 02:55:13,670
weakness that you might
come across and about.

2839
02:55:13,671 --> 02:55:16,590
Instilling that discipline to get up.
I've actually listened to cycle.

2840
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:24,900
I thought I got flanks for a second but
it actually wasn't. I stand corrected.

2841
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:30,720
What else we got? We got on it. If we're,

2842
02:55:30,721 --> 02:55:33,660
when you add to your home gym situation,

2843
02:55:33,661 --> 02:55:37,620
your home fitness situation going on
at.com/jack a lot of good stuff on there.

2844
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:39,810
Get a jump rope if you
don't like get rings.

2845
02:55:39,811 --> 02:55:43,710
Actually rings are 100% in my opinion
and I'm signing on 100% the best thing

2846
02:55:43,711 --> 02:55:46,850
that you can get, I need some
rinks. I know where to go for a,

2847
02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:49,380
I'm thinking about that from
my home gym or you definitely,

2848
02:55:49,381 --> 02:55:51,810
you definitely got to have rings it.
That's the first thing you need.

2849
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:53,670
I used to say the first thing
you need was a pull up bar,

2850
02:55:54,330 --> 02:55:58,020
but you can do more with rings and you
can do poems so you might as well just

2851
02:55:58,021 --> 02:56:00,390
get rigs kettlebells too,
by the way.

2852
02:56:02,670 --> 02:56:05,400
We got some books.
Okay. First of all book.

2853
02:56:05,490 --> 02:56:10,290
I again read a bunch of excerpts
today but not even close to putting,

2854
02:56:10,320 --> 02:56:14,130
giving justice to this book to
try to end by Jason Redmond.

2855
02:56:14,490 --> 02:56:19,380
We will have it up on the site,
right? Yes sir. On the top.

2856
02:56:20,430 --> 02:56:24,580
Oh, that's you have menus on the podcast
or something from episodes to be,

2857
02:56:24,590 --> 02:56:26,220
have you ever looked at our
website and thought, oh,

2858
02:56:26,221 --> 02:56:30,740
that looks like a cool website for 1996
yeah. I wonder if I was the only guy.

2859
02:56:31,880 --> 02:56:33,690
I was wondering if I was the
only guy and I was like, yeah,

2860
02:56:33,820 --> 02:56:37,630
well that's 96 but that's cool.
Maybe echoes just doesn't like me.

2861
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:42,710
Retro Retro is in eight more
years it's going to look cool.

2862
02:56:43,550 --> 02:56:46,100
That's what's happening with the,
with the website. So you know,

2863
02:56:46,101 --> 02:56:50,810
you're ahead of your time. Taco store
website looks all cool. Why is that?

2864
02:56:51,050 --> 02:56:55,380
Well, you know, various reasons.
Okay, cool. That sounds great. Uh,

2865
02:56:55,430 --> 02:56:56,670
we also got some books.
Mike Cain,

2866
02:56:56,671 --> 02:57:01,671
the dragons kids book for kids
between the ages of four and 100.

2867
02:57:06,410 --> 02:57:10,460
So get Mike in the dragons way,
the warrior kid and Mark's mission,

2868
02:57:10,520 --> 02:57:12,950
those are out and we have booked three,

2869
02:57:12,980 --> 02:57:16,590
which I completed is being drawn by
the artist right now. John Bozak. Uh,

2870
02:57:16,700 --> 02:57:18,890
we're going to put that up so
you can preorder it so you,

2871
02:57:19,010 --> 02:57:22,610
so I don't sell out of books like we
did Mikey and the dragons immediately.

2872
02:57:22,970 --> 02:57:26,330
So I will fix that this
time. I apologize. Last time.

2873
02:57:26,331 --> 02:57:28,880
Discipline equals freedom field
manual. Get that, how to get after it.

2874
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:33,440
Audio is on iTunes, Amazon music,
Google play, extreme ownership.

2875
02:57:33,441 --> 02:57:37,370
First Book that I wrote with my brother
Leif Babin and the follow on to that,

2876
02:57:37,371 --> 02:57:41,810
that dichotomy of leadership talking
about don't go too far in one direction or

2877
02:57:41,811 --> 02:57:46,811
the other as a leader or you will
blow it echelon front of my leadership

2878
02:57:47,121 --> 02:57:50,900
consultancy and what we do is
solve problems through leadership.

have in your organization,

2880
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:57,740
I 100% guarantee they
are leadership problems.

2881
02:57:58,220 --> 02:58:02,040
That's what they are and that's what
we do. Me Leif Babin, J P and l,

2898

so I don't want people to,

2899
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:03,360
I don't want non podcast listeners

leadership training.

2902
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:17,290
It is interact. I know, I know. It
sounds like one of those words like, uh,

2903
02:59:17,370 --> 02:59:21,580
like a Buzzword, right? Interactive,
but you straight up interacts.

2904
02:59:22,520 --> 02:59:24,810
Okay. Remember those video
games back in the day.

It's kind of like that.
Yes.

2910

You have to make leadership decisions
in the online training he did.

2911
02:59:42,030 --> 02:59:43,350
Once you learn the principles,

2912
02:59:43,351 --> 02:59:47,010
you have to try and apply them to
combat and business situations.

is once again in is not a combat book.

2934
03:01:17,471 --> 03:01:19,810
It is a journey of leadership
and at its heart and soul.

2935
03:01:19,811 --> 03:01:24,811
It is a love story and my
wife never batted an eye on

You've sacrificed a lot and you're still
out there every day grinding and making

2945
03:01:57,161 --> 03:02:01,990

2948
03:02:13,330 --> 03:02:18,040

those wounded warriors like Jay,

2949
03:02:18,310 --> 03:02:23,310
who continue to sacrifice bravely every
day for the freedoms that we all enjoy.

2950
03:02:25,970 --> 03:02:26,610

2954
03:02:37,021 --> 03:02:37,854

2955
03:02:39,340 --> 03:02:39,750
Okay.

2956

2959
03:02:48,770 --> 03:02:53,770
There are none men like Jay Redmond
proof that men like Ryan job prove that

2960
03:02:54,990 --> 03:02:56,130
without question.

2961
03:02:58,780 --> 03:03:01,450
So don't allow yourself to fall short.

2962
03:03:01,630 --> 03:03:06,580
Don't allow yourself to give anything
less than everything you've got.

2963
03:03:07,540 --> 03:03:07,950
Yeah.

2964
03:03:07,950 --> 03:03:12,950

ever in whatever that enemy might be.

2965
03:03:15,500 --> 03:03:16,280
Yeah.

2966
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:17,810
Do what you're supposed to do.

2967
03:03:17,990 --> 03:03:22,460
Be who you're supposed to be
by going out there every day

2968
03:03:24,910 --> 03:03:25,930
and getting after it.
