1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,620
This is Jocko podcast number one
oh seven with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,050
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,190
So the battle of I drang
valley was over for now and

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,820
okay,

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,800
we just spent two podcasts talking
about it and one of the things that you

6
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:29,750
forget sometimes about the military
is that the machine rolls on.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,530
Mm hmm. The machine rolls on.
There's a work to do and it doesn't.

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,690
It doesn't matter what you've been through
or what you experienced or how many

9
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:41,990
men or friends or leaders you lost.

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,870
The machine is going to roll on.
There's still work to do.

11
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,490
At least it's going to try and roll on.

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,210
And that means normal things
are gonna continue to happen,

13
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:56,450
meaning that people are
going to get reassigned,

14
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:58,250
people are going to leave the army,
people are going to retire.

15
00:00:58,251 --> 00:01:01,880
People are going to transfer. You
don't stay together. You don't.

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,940
You don't stay together with these
guys that you just went through.

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,590
Whatever you went through with.

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,310
And as much as you might feel like
a family with that group of guys,

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,400
you're not going to get treated
like a family in the military.

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,390
It's the machine is going to roll on and

21
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,800
with that mind to close out the book,

22
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:29,801
we were soldiers once and young that
again was covering podcast one oh five and

23
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:35,591
one oh six I'm going to read one more
passage from that book and here we go back

24
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:40,780
to the book every morning during those
final bittersweet days of my command of

25
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:41,601
the first battalion,

26
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:46,160
Seventh Cavalry Sergeant Major Plumley
would appear with a group of men bound

27
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:50,360
for the airfield and the plane that
would take them home for discharge

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,880
specialist for Pat Selleck
of the recon platoon,

29
00:01:55,881 --> 00:02:00,881
says Colonel Moore shook our hands
and said thank you and go back home.

30
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,470
I was the second or third guy he
spoke to and he had tears in his eyes.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,110
I remember what he said.
I see that you're married,

32
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,530
you have a wedding ring on.
Just go home,

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,120
pick up the pieces and start
your life all over again.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,120
And basically that's what I did.
I came home to a wonderful wife,

35
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,850
tried to readjust,
did a decent job at it.

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,070
I did what Colonel Morris said.
I tried to put the war behind me.

37
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,530
I served, I did my job. I came home.

38
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,390
I didn't ask for anything,
no fanfare, no parades.

39
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,620
I went back to work back
to school and did my best.

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,920
He might be a general,
but he still Colonel Moore to me.

41
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,760
Okay.

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,980
If it wasn't for him and all
his knowledge and training,

43
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,430
I don't think any of us would
have survived the, I drank valley

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,300
on Tuesday,

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,420
November 23rd the day came for me to
turn over command for the change of

46
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:18,650
command. I requested a full battalion
formation with officer's front and center.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,800
The division band trooping the line
honors to the reviewing officer and colors

48
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,910
and then pass in review.

49
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,750
Reminiscent of our weekly retreat
parades back at Fort Benning.

50
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,000
I requested that captain did, Directs
Bravo Company, Second Battalion,

51
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:38,690
Seventh Cavalry and lieutenant systems,
platoon of Alpha company,

52
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:42,770
second of the seventh be included in
the per tape parade of First Battalion

53
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,790
Seventh Cavalry in token to the fact
that they fought bravely alongside us in

54
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,810
the battle at X-ray.

55
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,560
Yeah,

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,610
and so it was

57
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,410
the band played colonel bogey and the
Washington Post March and Gary Owen.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,320
Yeah.

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,320
General Canard pinned on my eagles and
I spoke briefly and with deep emotion.

60
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,720
Okay.

61
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,300
SPEC for Ray Turner of Alpha Company.

62
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:14,301
First Battalion said we stood in formation
with some units hardly having enough

63
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:16,890
men to form up.

64
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,350
Okay.

65
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,500
Colonel Hal Moore spoke
to us and he cried.

66
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:22,940
Okay.

67
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,840
At that moment, he could have
let us back into the, I drag.

68
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,660
Yeah.

69
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,770
We were soldiers.

70
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,780
We were fighting men and those of us
who were left had the utmost love and

71
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:37,150
respect for our kernel
and for one another.

72
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,460
Okay.

73
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,720
As I reflect on those three days in
November, I remember many heroes,

74
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,790
but no cowards.

75
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,630
Yeah.

76
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,000
I learned what value life really had.

77
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,560
We all lost friends,

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,520
but the bravery they
showed on the battlefield,

79
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,940
we'll live forever.

80
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,113
Well,

81
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,780
we have tried here

82
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,073
two

83
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,340
remember and display

84
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,000
and spread the word on some
of that bravery that were
shown on the battlefields

85
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,870
so that it does live on.

86
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,060
And I think that is the least we can do.

87
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,680
Yeah.
That and learn,

88
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,930
try and learn.

89
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:50,490
We must always try and learn and we can
certainly learn from a man that had been

90
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:55,491
through so much and was so
respected and revered by his men.

91
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:59,000
And so today we're going
to delve into another book.

92
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,420
Okay.

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,420
And this one is actually by General Hal
Moore and Co written by another army

94
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,620
vet,
a younger army vet,

95
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,070
another off author Mike Gornia.

96
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,240
And the book is called
how more on leadership.

97
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,390
And it's just that it's principles and
faults about leadership that how more

98
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,463
learned.

99
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:26,780
Okay.

100
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,520
And then implemented throughout
his life and his career. And again,

101
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:36,110
if you haven't listened to podcasts,
one oh five and one oh six yet,

102
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:41,090
go back and listen to those podcasts first
because that'll give you some context

103
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,290
as to what general more live through and
why we should pay attention to what he

104
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,230
has to say.
So again,

105
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,750
the book is how more on leadership.

106
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,660
Okay.

107
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,380
The subtitle is a winning
when outgunned and outmanned

108
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,920
kicks off in the prologue, it says all
of one's life is a learning experience.

109
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,910
I learned a lot of lessons along the way.
I'm still learning.

110
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,940
These are values, principles, lessons
I've learned, mistakes, successes,

111
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:18,340
and my thoughts on
leadership from watching,

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,990
studying and reading about
leaders in action, good leaders,

113
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,290
mediocre leaders,
and bad leaders.

114
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,980
So he wrote this book.
This book only came out,

115
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,900
I actually have to check.

116
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,020
It came out very came out in 2017
so this book is at the end of,

117
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,960
of how Mora's life.
And here we go.

118
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,270
We're gonna jump right into
some of these principles.

119
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,920
He starts off with four basic principles
of leadership. Principle number one,

120
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:58,120
three strikes. And you're not
out in the game of baseball,

121
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,970
three strikes and you're out not.
So in the game of life,

122
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,650
three strikes and you're not out.

123
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:03,870
Okay.

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,280
There are two things a leader can do.

125
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,330
He can either contaminate his environment
and his people with his attitude and

126
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:14,310
actions, or he can inspire
confidence. Good point.

127
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,880
Hmm. There's always another
way in life, right? Sure.

128
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,090
Three strikes for strikes.
You can keep swinging.

129
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,340
There's no umpire to call you out.
Back to the book. He must have,

130
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,960
have and display the will to
prevail by his actions, his words,

131
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:33,390
his tone of voice, his appearance,
his demeanor, his countenance,

132
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:35,100
and the look in his eyes.

133
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,570
He must never give off any hint or
evidence that he is uncertain about a

134
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:42,650
positive outcome.

135
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,673
Yeah.

136
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,260
So that's something that, you
know, we saw an action in the book.

137
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,700
We were soldiers once and
young when you know, Rick,

138
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,960
we're scroller comes up and says, where
are they at? Good. Oh, big. Bring it.

139
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,010
They got tonight.

140
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,290
Just even though inside he
admitted he was worried. Yeah. But,

141
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,370
and then you hear the reactions of
the other guys. They were saying, wow,

142
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:06,690
that's cool. At least this guys in the
game, look, I'm, I'm game. If he's game,

143
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,524
let's go.

144
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,890
Do you think that that could elicit
some sort of a blow back in? Definitely.

145
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,520
It definitely. In fact, I have my note
there. You wanna see my note right there.

146
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:22,140
Says, can you read that? It says really,
cause it's one of those things for sure.

147
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,980
You're right. Eight, if you roll in and
you're getting smashed and you show,

148
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,430
you can, you can seem oblivious to
reality. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

149
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,310
He addresses that. Standby.
Here we go. Back to the book.

150
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,820
It struck me early in my reading
in school and later in life,

151
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,600
that is a common theme running through
books and stories about great leaders.

152
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,750
Was there positive outlook,
positive mental attitude,

153
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,530
PMA for all those bad
brains fans out there.

154
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,750
They were aware of the pitfalls.
They were. This is the your point.

155
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,090
They were aware of the
pitfalls and negatives,

156
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,100
but they refuse to fret and worry
about them. So there you go.

157
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,350
No, we're not talking like, oh
this isn't happening over there.

158
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,840
Like remember Baghdad. Bob, are
you old enough to remember that?

159
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,140
But I think you mentioned Baghdad.

160
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:12,141
Bob Wall tanks were just while the Iraqi
army was getting obliterated in the

161
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:17,130
first Gulf War. He was sitting there
going, Oh yes, we've had many victories.

162
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,140
You know, he just completely oblivious
to what was happening in, and there's,

163
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,810
I think there was literally like bombs
going off in the background. Yeah,

164
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,970
Baghdad. Bob. Okay, here we go.
Back to the principle number two.

165
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,650
There's always one more thing you can
do to influence any situation in your

166
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,920
favor.
And after that there's one more thing.

167
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,250
And after that there's one more thing.
And after that one more thing.

168
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,360
The one more things you do,
the more one more things you do,

169
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:53,010
the better your chances are for achieving
success in any situation. Elite.

170
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,113
This is interesting.

171
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,140
A leader must create time to detach
himself mentally and ask one of my,

172
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,010
what am I doing that I should not be doing
and what am I not doing that I should

173
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:07,110
be doing to influence the
situation in my favor?

174
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,050
So he's talking about attachment.

175
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,450
I agree with them clearly.
That's a good,

176
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,950
it's good to have those like specific
things to ask yourself when you detach.

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,520
You know how like I'd always ask yourself
like, okay, what do we have here?

178
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:27,410
But even that, that's like a broad
question broad, right? Yeah. That's like,

179
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,320
that's way better. That's
good. Yeah. If you think about,

180
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,840
if you think about your life and you've,
you were constantly saying like, what,

181
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:40,530
what, what should I be doing right
now and what should I not be?

182
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,430
We're all doing things that we should not
be doing, right? Well not me, but yeah,

183
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:48,660
man. Oh, you're, you're just
perfect. Perfect. So we're
all doing things that we, we,

184
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,140
we know we shouldn't be doing and we're
all know that there's things that we

185
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,460
should be doing that
we're not so detached.

186
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,650
Look at yourself. Do an assessment. Yeah.

187
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,950
I'm sure that's like a goldmine of things
you can change right there for sure.

188
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:04,240
It's two questions for sure.
Here's a,

189
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,340
here he says a leader is
paid to do three things,

190
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,840
get the job done and get it done. Well,
plan ahead. Be Proactive, not reactive,

191
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,870
exercise, good sound judgment,
and doing all of the above

192
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,690
to get the job done.

193
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:20,860
The leader must have a clearly defined
mission along with specific goals and

194
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:24,760
objectives.
So there you go.

195
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,230
Brandon pick worth hit me up.
Sure.

196
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,840
Because the last podcast I was talking
about goals and he had sent me a text

197
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:34,510
about
getting belt.

198
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:38,650
I think it was about getting belt in
Jujitsu and I think that's what it was.

199
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,660
But anyways,
he was basically calling me a hypocrite

200
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,420
because, you know, my, my, my thing is
like, hey, you trained to get better.

201
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,320
You don't train because you want this
thing, right. You train because you,

202
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,670
you have, uh, uh, I should see, it's not
that, it's not that there's no goal there,

203
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,360
but your goal is different.
Your goal isn't a material item of cloth.

204
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,890
Your goal is to get better at Jujitsu.
Brandon, yeah, you're on lockdown.

205
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,950
You want to hear a very seemingly far
fetched analogy to that. But it's not.

206
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,650
The other night I was,
uh,

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,200
making arts and crafts. Uh,
we went down with Presley.

208
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,520
You just chilling out
doing some paper per say.

209
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,100
So, so, uh, why did she do shit?

210
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,400
She will basically, I said a joke and
then she laughed at and I, no, no,

211
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,010
she said a joke and then I
laughed. And then she, so she said,

212
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,920
I'm gonna I'm gonna say this
joke again and laugh again.

213
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,210
Just like you did before. Yeah.
So am I. So I thought about that.

214
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:48,940
Of course I did it,
but weak

215
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,630
story of my life right there.
But um, so she says it,

216
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:58,120
I do it right. And then I'm thinking
like, isn't that interesting?

217
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:02,650
She got the laugh and that was a big
payoff. It, here's the thing, in a way,

218
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,060
she shouldn't be focusing on the last,

219
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:06,550
he should be focusing
on saying funny jokes.

220
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,320
The laugh just for, where'd you take it?
Easy. I didn't tell her that didn't score,

221
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,490
but you see what I'm saying?
No, same thing. Jujitsu.

222
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,060
You focus on getting better at Jujitsu.

223
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,460
The belt will come as
kind of like a result,

224
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:21,310
a little byproduct if you
will dislike the laughs.

225
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,440
So you know when you're telling jokes,
go for the funniness. Not for the laugh,

226
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,810
the laugh or I'll talk to Presley,
I'll pull her aside.

227
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,920
I have a little chat with her. Well maybe
you know Brandon pick worth, you know,

228
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:35,860
maybe he'd, you know, find
that very enlightening.

229
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Just see tighten him
up. He did. By the way,

230
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:43,090
he did do his hundred burpees and
sub 10 minutes. He actually got it.

231
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,920
I forget what his time was. Yeah, I never,
I never went back there to do that man.

232
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,080
You did it easily then you do these.
They did it.

233
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,920
It depends on what you mean by easily.

234
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,680
You did it or not did it.
I did it with

235
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,530
did you have minutes to spare?

236
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,210
I had a minute to spare
if I remember correctly.

237
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,220
Had One minute to spare and I knew that
at like the last coasted crews kind.

238
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,250
I coasted into the finish line week. It
was still Kinda, I was sore the next day.

239
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,600
I was actually, sorry Brandon one
his video. He did good burpees.

240
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,300
I'll give him that much credit. Better
burpees than my normal burpees for sure.

241
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,250
Yeah. Like is burpees look,
they look clean. So mine,

242
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,200
they didn't merit like 12 minutes
when he got that down. Yeah. Yeah.

243
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,860
If you would have saw my burpees
and said, hey, those aren't full,

244
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,770
all of those aren't full burpees. I
would not be surprised. Put it that way.

245
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,420
Just do. Okay. All right.
Going back to the book,

246
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,420
the smart leader should
always think through the what
ifs and have a plan on how

247
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:51,830
to handle them before they occur.
Times so spent is never wasted.

248
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,620
Things do not always go as planned.
So again,

249
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,780
he talks a bunch about planning and he's
like, got things don't go as planned.

250
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,390
And we all have to remember that the
smart leader must also be mindful of as

251
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,980
organization's constraints
and center of gravity.

252
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,370
There can be one or several constraints
that inhibits getting the job done.

253
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:10,850
And I think we all kind of understands
that and he says that the constraints

254
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:15,170
must accurately be defined.
But the center of gravity idea was,

255
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,810
it was a little bit more interesting
to me. Here we go to the book.

256
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,530
The center of gravity is the principal
thing or activity that must be in balance

257
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,600
or under control for an organization to
operate is the organization's source of

258
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:31,010
strength. In addition to understanding
your own center of gravity to protect it,

259
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,520
you must recognize and attack
your enemies or competitors,

260
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:38,690
center of gravity to defeat them.
In that battle in Vietnam,

261
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,930
my center of gravity was the landing zone.
So he's talking about the,

262
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:46,100
I drank valley and the new that and lock
that thing down and fought hard for it.

263
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,770
Dean, I was training with Dean,
I dunno, a few months ago,

264
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,040
and then he was teaching a class and
one thing you said that was really

265
00:16:55,041 --> 00:17:00,041
interesting and really smart
about Jujitsu is he's like,

266
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:04,670
Hey, when you're on the ground,
you can't have your balance attack.

267
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,200
Meaning if you're the on the bottom,
you can't have your belt, your audio,

268
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,070
you're going down there. So you have to
mess with the person's balance on top.

269
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,740
He's like, they can't mess with your
balance cause you're already down there.

270
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,330
You need to mess with their balance.
Yeah, good point, Huh? Yeah, exactly.

271
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:20,570
It's one of those things. Yeah,
there's a lot. There's a lot to that.

272
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,170
There's a lot to that.
Interestingly, it's like val, you're,

273
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,890
cause you're talking about like a
really deep fundamental concept.

274
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:32,520
One thing for sure. And a lot of times
we don't learn all of them. You know,

275
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,730
we enjoyed it too and
obviously in life too,

276
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:37,550
but we don't learn all
the fundamental concepts.

277
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,830
So even you can go through life
and be successful, you know,

278
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:44,831
varying levels and then get introduced
to one fundamental concept that'll just

279
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:48,380
like, Dang. And this is something that,
you know, I know we all know if you did,

280
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,710
you did too.
You know that if you're on the bottom,

281
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,860
you've got a suite to get on top of, you
know, you, you know that. But what he was,

282
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:56,520
he wasn't even saying sweep.
Yeah. He was saying you have to,

283
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,690
you have to attack their balance.
Yeah.

284
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,070
Cause you can't have your balance tact
cause you're on the ground already.

285
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,860
You attack their balance and it's
just going to open things up.

286
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,810
He wasn't talking. You're gonna
sweep every time. No you're not.

287
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,160
You're going to get the unlock though.

288
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:12,510
You're going to get a position change
going to get rolled into a heal hook.

289
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:16,950
Right. But it's interesting when
he talks it like when, when,

290
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:20,190
how more general more here is talking
about not only do you have to know your

291
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:23,280
center of gravity, you've got to know
your opponent, center of gravity.

292
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:24,510
So that's what you attack.

293
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,040
Which is interesting because people
would most heavily defend their center of

294
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,390
gravity,
you would think.

295
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,110
And therefore it would be counter to
the Sun Tzu principle of don't attack to

296
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:41,340
heavily guarded area but
or heavily defended area.

297
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,233
But

298
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,320
you got to find a way to get
through to their center of gravity.

299
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:49,060
Otherwise you're not gonna put them
off balance. You're not going to win.

300
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,890
Like that's one of the goals, you know
is the attack that cause some people,

301
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,770
I mean even cause Dean tour totally
clarified the concept for you. Yeah.

302
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,190
Where it's like this is going on in the
game and you know maybe that maybe in

303
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:04,810
certain circumstances it's intuitive.

304
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,630
Like okay I'm going to tack this guy's
balanced because specifically I'm going

305
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:10,480
for a specific suite or whatever.
Maybe it'll come in and out of your mind,

306
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,680
but if you have that clear in your mind
that that's part of this whole game that

307
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:17,200
we're playing and, and go
back to the sunsuit. Well,

308
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,730
just because this is me figuring out
right now is just because you're attacking

309
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:25,530
their center of gravity doesn't mean
you have to do a frontal assault on,

310
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,700
you should still flanking
exactly what I mean. Yeah.

311
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,270
But now at the end of the day, now
that's part of my goal. You know,

312
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,860
my goal isn't just to kill everyone
or whatever. It's like, okay,

313
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:36,694
we're going to attack this,

314
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,900
this center of gravity specifically
because that'll open up with it, you know,

315
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,980
and everything else that comes with
it. Yeah. But it's clarified now it is

316
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,470
back to the book while
getting the job done,

317
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:53,100
the leader must plan ahead and create
the future. He must be proactive,

318
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:57,720
not reactive. Truly great leaders have
acuity, our perceptive, aggressive,

319
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:00,000
enthusiastic,
concede trends,

320
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,490
analyze them carefully and correctly,
have a vision, have confidence in it,

321
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,520
and can inspire and motivate himself
and his people to make it happen.

322
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,610
That's a big laundry list of
things for a leader to be doing.

323
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,743
Hmm.

324
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,350
That's why leaders,
that's why leadership is hard job.

325
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,390
Thinking about all those
things I just rattled off.

326
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,850
He must have a positive attitude and must
hate the word no. He must have smart,

327
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:26,100
well trained people to
run day to day activities.

328
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,850
He must check up on them and make sure
the job is getting done while he stacks

329
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:33,720
the deck for future success. So you can
see right now he's not micromanaging.

330
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,750
He's getting people that can do the
job and then he's looking forward.

331
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,830
Principle number three,
when nothing is wrong,

332
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,220
there's nothing wrong except
there's nothing wrong.

333
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,370
That's when a leader has to be most alert.
Complacency

334
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,950
leaders are paid to
create order out of chaos.

335
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,940
History is replete with examples of
leaders who failed because they became too

336
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:58,480
complacent in the days and months
leading up to Pearl Harbor,

337
00:20:58,481 --> 00:20:59,950
American military leaders,

338
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:03,790
we're confident that the Japanese
could never strike American soil.

339
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,010
Our naval intelligence said that Pearl
Harbor was too far out of reach for a

340
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,490
Japanese naval taskforce. They were also
convinced the harbor was too shallow.

341
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:13,690
For a torpedo attack.

342
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,290
Instead of prioritizing the threat
from an aggressive naval enemy,

343
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,550
the Army Air Corps commander at wheeler
and Hickam fields put a higher priority

344
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,430
on the threat from spies and saboteurs.

345
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,800
They grouped the planes together at
the air field to make them easier for

346
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:32,320
walking centuries to guard on foot patrol.

347
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,950
But when the Japanese bombers arrived
on December 7th the clustered American

348
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:41,790
planes became Turkey shoot
targets. Didn't know that. Hmm.

349
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,430
Didn't know that wrong threat assessment.

350
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,570
And now you're doing something that's
actually gonna help your enemies real

351
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:52,100
attack. But it's complacency. Hmm.

352
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,350
Pin principle number four,
trust your instincts.

353
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,120
Instincts are the product
of one's personality,

354
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,220
experience reading and education.
That's,

355
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,310
that's interesting, right?
He puts reading in there.

356
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,790
You're actually getting experience from
reading a new house said that General

357
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,250
Mattis, General Mattis, he reads,

358
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,530
I think he has a personal book
collection of like 5,000 or 7,000 books.

359
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,060
Personal Book Collection. Okay.
That was good. And he said he,

360
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,750
that's to prevent him from being
surprised because if you know history,

361
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,280
you know the future.

362
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,303
Hmm.

363
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,010
But that's a great definition of what
instinct is. Cause people think instinct.

364
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:43,880
Is this something that's some
mysterious thing, right? But no,

365
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,980
it's your personality, experience,
reading and education. Yeah.

366
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,520
As far as the context, he's
putting it in. I mean, instinct,

367
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:53,300
obviously it's clearly
defined as something else.

368
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,900
What is it clearly defined as?

369
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,930
Say I knew, oh no, no, no. You know how
like animals have instincts to, oh yeah,

370
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:02,810
we have instincts to procreate, like
all this stuff like that. I mean,

371
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:05,420
obviously he's talking about a specific
concept yet he's not talking about the

372
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:08,810
instinct to procreate. No, no, no,
no. Something else. But I'm saying,

373
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,190
you know what I mean? It's
not there as mystical. Yes.

374
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,660
His definition is not mystical.
Yeah. It's like, Hey, read, learn,

375
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,630
experience and then, yeah. So
you know, like how, um, you know,

376
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,590
your gut feeling kind
of thing. Yeah. So yeah.

377
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:27,650
It's to me like if you don't
have any experience in any, uh,

378
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,870
like you're not reading
nothing and you don't have any,

379
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,130
you're not going to have many
gut instincts. No. You will.
You'll still be way off.

380
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:36,330
Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna be funny,
I was talking about talking about

381
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,100
this with someone when, uh,
sometimes like with an injury,

382
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,040
let's say you have an injury and
you think, I'll just do this,

383
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,700
but what you're is actually completely

384
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,050
wrong. Yeah. Yeah. That
happens to me. Sometimes I'll
have an injury and I'll say,

385
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:53,870
you know what? I'll just keep
stretching it. It hurts a little bit,

386
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:58,270
but it'll be okay. I think that's helping
it. And I'm just wrong. Just wrong. Yeah.

387
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,180
And the,
so let's say you were,

388
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,190
you did that over and over and over and
over and over and over and over again,

389
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,210
which you probably have, but I'm
saying normal person, you do it over,

390
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,700
then the instincts will
kind of recalibrate itself.

391
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,980
Yeah. Because eventually you go,
hey, this doesn't work. Yeah. Hey,

392
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,900
do you mobilize that broken wing
or whatever? Yeah, exactly. Check.

393
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,100
Just like,
if you don't know,

394
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:26,650
did you tune when you get into a fight
with someone who does need you to say

395
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:29,380
you're going to do your instincts that
you know, which is nothing, by the way,

396
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,080
and your instincts are gonna be completely
wrong. Completely wrong. But you dude,

397
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,560
this guy off me. Yeah, exactly.
Or I'll power out of this.

398
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,700
Oh, you know, I'll go off

399
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,590
per hard. That's a great example. Yeah,

400
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,960
and then when you learn did you
to recalibrate your instincts now,

401
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,880
now your instincts are good and proper
unless you get one of these tricky guys

402
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:49,900
who knows your instincts.

403
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:53,380
So he's going to base his instincts off
a year and to see what I'm saying. Yeah.

404
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:57,760
Now we're getting in strategy
though. That's true. All right.

405
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,670
Back to the book.
It's a nice talking about instinct.

406
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,760
It's a kind of sixth sense when seconds
count instincts and decisiveness come

407
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,860
into play in quick developing situations,

408
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,700
the leader must act fast in park
confidence to all around him.

409
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,470
Must not second guessed the decision,
make it happen in the process.

410
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:21,520
He cannot stand around slack jawed
when he's hit with the unexpected,

411
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:26,320
he must face up to the facts
and deal with them and move on.

412
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,160
When my head tells me to do one thing
and my gut tells me to do another,

413
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,760
I will always go with my
gut. Why? Because my gut,

414
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,940
because my gut as I've
learned is rarely wrong.

415
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,580
Now that's, that's a bold
statement right there. Yeah.

416
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,260
You got to my,

417
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,280
if my instincts are telling me one thing
and my brain is telling me something

418
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:52,720
else that is, to me, that's the
time to reassess what's going on.

419
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,200
Cause I've got some conflicting things
happening going because I'm pretty

420
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,220
logical in thinking through things.

421
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,820
And if that is getting completely
countered by just some emotional feeling,

422
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:10,300
which kind of, that's what an instinct
is, right? That's, that can be my name. B,

423
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,520
it can be emotional. Right. So you
gotta watch out for that. Yeah.

424
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,600
It seems like in an emotion or a situation
predicated on emotion strongly like

425
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:26,430
a, I dunno, a relationship with
somebody. I'm just going to go with my,

426
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,870
this case met your gut. Your
heart to go with my gut. Yeah.
You're wrong. No, no, no.

427
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,900
Yeah. You're probably wrong on now. And
I'll think about it. Commodity logic,

428
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:40,370
logical side, back to the book
instinct as a kind of caution light,

429
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,700
an early warning or a gut feeling which
can on occasion result in a far better

430
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,920
decision than one based
on a logical process.

431
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,810
One rule of thumb I learned more than 60
years ago at west point is if there's a

432
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:55,170
doubt in your mind,
there's no doubt at all.

433
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,380
Okay.

434
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,210
In other words, if you know in your heart
that an action is wrong, don't do it.

435
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,130
One of my sons calls this
the rule of doubts above all,

436
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,940
never tried to fake out,
deceive or fool the people under you.

437
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:15,210
Not only is it wrong but the troops
can smell bs from miles away.

438
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,970
Hmm.
See that starts to make more sense.

439
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,060
If it's something that's wrong
then it makes a lot of sense,

440
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,130
but it makes a lot of
sense rather than right.

441
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,950
The the way I hurt would
hear this and the teams,

442
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,520
I didn't need to know
it came from west point,

443
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,190
but they'd say if there is a
doubt than there is no doubt,

444
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:35,350
which I guess is the same thing,
which is this shorter.

445
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,950
If there is a doubt than there
is no doubt and that means what?

446
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:41,790
Like if meaning any doubt, then that means
there's no doubt that it's wrong. Yes,

447
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,070
yes. Or if you're saying, wait, I don't
know if this is the right thing to do,

448
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,140
it's probably not. Okay. Probably not.

449
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,253
Instincts

450
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,170
like when ducks fly south for the winter,
weight is it's north or south,

451
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,220
they fly south for the winter warmer.
That's an instinct,

452
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,670
but I don't know what that is. Is that
an instinct? Yeah. Cool. Straight up.

453
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,020
Just like,
like if your baby like suckling,

454
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,120
you know so you can feed.
That's instinct.

455
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,240
Interesting. Let's see. Back to the book.

456
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,790
Back to the book of the discipline that
makes an effective leader begins in the

457
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:32,320
home. In most cases learning comes
through observation and experience.

458
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,920
It is through the parents and or legal
guardians where we first begin to

459
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:40,420
understand right from wrong and success
or failure in having guidelines and

460
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:45,190
expectations set before me as a young
boy having to toe the line was the

461
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,630
standard of every day.

462
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,160
While I remember my mother and father
requiring discipline and proper conduct,

463
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,420
there was an equal balance of
love. Fondant, fishing, reading,

464
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:58,240
religion and daydreaming.
Yes. Daydreaming,

465
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,880
discipline. Cool. Daydreaming.

466
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,010
Makes Sense. But you don't automatically
associate that with discipline.

467
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,260
No, you don't. You don't.

468
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,500
But if you follow your
daydreams all the time,

469
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,130
then you won't end up with anything. So
you have to have them both. Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,640
Next one. No job is ever
beneath you in whatever you do,

471
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,440
do it to the best of your abilities.

472
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:38,410
Next, the best leaders try
the best leaders strive to
create a family environment

473
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:42,100
within their organization. A good
leader aims to his subordinates feel

474
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,900
that they are valued members of a team.

475
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,220
The same loyalty that goes up the chain
of command must also go down the chain

476
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:51,130
of command and across the
network of subordinates.

477
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,740
Yeah,

478
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,320
and and by the way, of course, as
always, I'm not reading this whole book.

479
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,410
There's all kinds of better detail in
the book itself and explanations and I'm

480
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:05,780
hitting the the wave tops as
they say. Sure. That's good.

481
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,660
I like this one a little bit.

482
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,440
The first person you have to
lead and discipline is yourself.

483
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,450
Okay,

484
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,500
good versus poor choices.
Make all the difference in the world.

485
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,393
Hmm.

486
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,360
Concur. Back to the book. To be a leader,

487
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:25,340
you must be willing to
be a lifelong learner.

488
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,520
The leaders who fail are those who think
they know everything or that they have

489
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:31,760
nothing left to learn.

490
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,500
They resent having to learn something
new or adapt to a new situation.

491
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,210
Got To be humble.

492
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,080
Hey, this is interesting. I like
to do a lot of listening that way.

493
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:50,220
I pick up a lot of good ideas. Many
from subordinates. When you listen,

494
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,800
you know twice as much as the other guy,

495
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,650
what he knows and what you know.

496
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,290
Just also whenever the boss talked,
I not only listened but I took notes.

497
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,840
I still carry three by five cards
today, so that's, that's a great one.

498
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,280
If you let someone else talk,

499
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,630
I was doing a security detail.

500
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,660
He and I rack my first
appointment over there and I,

501
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,760
and we picked up a high high ranking
officer and we were the security detail

502
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,870
form and he was picking up some
subordinate officers along the way.

503
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,270
And it was so interesting how
this high ranking officer,

504
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,890
depending on who got in the vehicle,

505
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,390
because we met with multiple
different subordinate officers of his,

506
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,440
and it was American guy. What's that?
Oh yeah. These are all Americans,

507
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,730
all Americans. But the senior officer, he,

508
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:49,790
he would barely say anything and the
guys would get in and you can hear them,

509
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,790
you know, at first they sort of listen
for a minute and they couldn't handle it.

510
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,760
So they just start
talking and they tell us,

511
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,460
they tell the boss everything
is a great technique.

512
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,760
You just sit there quietly and you, these
people are spilling their guts. Yeah.

513
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:06,140
Isn't that in negotiation?
For sure. For sure. Yeah.

514
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,070
Where you just don't see anything.
You just need to be like, well yeah.

515
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:11,930
And it can make people uncomfortable.
Yeah.

516
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,320
But that's a great way of looking at it.
And when you talk you're,

517
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,110
and that same thing
happens in any situation.

518
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,650
I've said it before on this podcast. The
more you talk, the less people listen,

519
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,620
Huh? Yeah. Just the way it is. Yeah.

520
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,160
He had a kind of a, some challenges
getting into West Point and oh,

521
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,130
he did get in and he had a couple of
lessons learned from that and never say no

522
00:32:35,131 --> 00:32:39,980
to yourself when you need to
ask for something, make the
other guy say no. That's,

523
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,360
that's, that's a good point, right?

524
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,030
Like I'm not just going to say I'll
echo would never say yes to this,

525
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:46,880
so I'm just going to knock and ask
him. No, I'm going to ask him echo,

526
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,720
can you make a couple more videos?
Worst thing you can do is say no,

527
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:55,010
which is likely, I forget if I
read this or listening to it,

528
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:59,540
but there's two kinds of askers
people who ask for stuff, right?

529
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,403
There's two kinds.

530
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,490
One Who thinks like that where it's
like the worst they can say is no.

531
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,900
Somebody last or the second
kind who is like, he, you know,

532
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,990
he might say no, but I, you
know how like some people,

533
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,150
I don't know if you're like
this, maybe you are, I dunno,

534
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,990
but some people they're uncomfortable
when to like saying no to someone.

535
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:20,750
Like it's like you're the bad
guy, you know, kind of like, Hey,

536
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,600
can you retweet this charity
or something like that.

537
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,300
And then if you say no,
you're the bad guy.

538
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,960
And that's an extreme example of course.
But the people are like that.

539
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,460
But some people there, if they're,
I forget the name of the ask or,

540
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:37,100
but if you're the kind of ask her that's
like, oh, the worst they can say no.

541
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:38,660
If you're that kind of
person and someone asks you,

542
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:41,120
you have no usually have
no problem saying no.

543
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,760
But if you're the other
kind where it's like, Dang,

544
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:46,850
now he put me in a
position to be the bad guy.

545
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,460
They're way less likely to ask for stuff
because they don't want to feel that

546
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:55,370
way. They don't want to put that person
in that position. So it's like, yeah,

547
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:56,510
the worst thing they can say no,

548
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:59,920
but I don't want to put him
in that position because
he's going to feel like how

549
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,240
I would test your skin.
There's like two kinds of people,

550
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,830
but it's weird when you get the
clash of the kind of person,

551
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,010
let's say I'm the kind of person who I
don't want to put you in the position to

552
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:14,480
say no. So I kind of, I'll be real
shy to ask, but you're the opposite.

553
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,910
You're going to be asking me for
stuff and I'm going to be like,

554
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,270
I won't answer you. I'll be
bothered by if you, you know,

555
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,500
first few days and be like, man, I
can't believe he's asking me to do this.

556
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,730
You know, I can't believe he's
asking me to give me shit. Yeah, no,

557
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:32,180
but in my mind, if I say no, now I'm
the bad guy and now you're in my mind,

558
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:35,450
you're at home sitting, can't believe
like, he won't do this for me or you know,

559
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,450
you go through all this
stuff, but um, yeah,

560
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,150
that's when you get that class
tormenting living in your head.

561
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:49,160
I'm like, no, next question. See.
But then even when you say like, no,

562
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,660
like text message fully
with text messages,

563
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,380
you know how you'll do
you say to real life,

564
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:57,770
but at least I can see the look on your
face. Like you're kind of half joking.

565
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:01,940
I see it and all this stuff. But in
text message you say, no period. Right?

566
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,080
That's it. So I'm like, no, chocolate
anatomy just mad at me for something.

567
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:10,610
And he's like, he wouldn't have said
it like that, you know? But so yeah,

568
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:11,840
you make it really hard and man,

569
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,910
people read into a lot of stuff then
that's obviously you have to read it into

570
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:19,850
some stuff to figure out what's going on.
Most people go crazy with that.

571
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,670
Are you even married? Right?
You got to read into everything.

572
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,920
Every little thing you got to eat into.
Hey,

573
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,450
you got to know. All right,
back to the book. Never quit.

574
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,400
Obvious. Next one of find a way
to turn every minus into a plus.

575
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,173
Good.

576
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,120
There is a solution to every problem.
Some are more complex than others.

577
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:50,860
There's always a way, uh,
while he was at West Point,

578
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,253
he

579
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,400
okay,

580
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,830
learned about toxic leadership and here
we go. They were, they were putting, um,

581
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,810
under the command or they're
putting the squads and here we go.

582
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:04,220
Each squad had two different squad
leaders one month with each. I've never,

583
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,680
never forgotten those two men. The first
one was arrogant, was an, was an arrogant,

584
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,590
sadistic person who
screamed and yelled at us,

585
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,350
made us do unmerciful physical exercises.

586
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,320
Apparently with the goal of driving
the week to quit the academy,

587
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,000
I despise that man. A leader should never
be arrogant, spiteful, condescending,

588
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:23,610
or engage in gossip.
To the contrary,

589
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,780
he should always act with humility and
treat his subordinates with respect and

590
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:29,160
dignity as a leader.

591
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:32,310
Your words and action to have greater
impact on your subordinates and you

592
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:36,000
realize,
thus choose your words carefully.

593
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,490
Avoid Sarcasm and flippancy.

594
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:43,170
Do not insult or take digs at
anyone's intelligence. Remember,

595
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,280
everyone processes information
differently and at different speeds.

596
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,050
Don't automatically assume that someone
is stupid or indifferent because they

597
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:55,140
haven't mastered a particular task yet.

598
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,060
Okay.

599
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,120
That stuff is so important.

600
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,860
This is something that I screw
up because, you know, being an s,

601
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,870
growing up in a seal platoon, everyone's
always like picking on each other. Uh,

602
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:12,420
what's that called? Verbally sparring
and cutting each other down, you know?

603
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:16,560
And that's just the way it is.
And I still have that in me.

604
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,080
Like the, I still have that in me, Hailey.

605
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,790
I don't know. Do I not
do that too? So what,

606
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,690
but I can do that sometimes
when I know I should, I'm like,

607
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:30,060
I'll do it to my kids sometimes
will do to my wife sometimes.

608
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,670
And sometimes I don't realize it
until afterwards. And the thing is

609
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,380
in my mind, I'm kidding. Yeah. It's
all good. Like I have no ill will,

610
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:43,690
but you know, you can't do that. Yeah.

611
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:48,750
So that's one I need to always be careful
of because I have a tendency to treat

612
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,550
other people like their e fives
and a seal platoon with me.

613
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,610
And that's not always good.
Yeah. Especially the wipe thing.

614
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:02,170
You mentioned that before the late, yeah.
Oh, I said it, this was the other day,

615
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,940
January 1st right.
First day of the new gear.

616
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,670
And I forget what my wife did.
Oh yeah.

617
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:13,800
I forgot what she did, but I was
like, oh, what a loser. Right? Yeah.

618
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,690
And here's the thing, I've said
that plenty of times and you know,

619
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:20,600
whatever to her, and she said it
to me, whatever, but they day,

620
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,300
but either way it was cut.

621
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,710
It's not like with you if I said that or
so, or something like that or whatever.

622
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,530
There would be a consistent reaction.
I hundred percent consent.

623
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,220
Right. Where you'd be
like, yeah, it's obviously,

624
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:41,080
I don't really think you're a loser.
Right.

625
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,270
The fact I said it is part
of verbal smart, whatever.

626
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:47,920
That's a consistent kind of
interpretation. You sheets. Yeah. And um,

627
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,270
but so she said back, she's like, oh,

628
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:56,500
first insult of the new year, kind of
like, sure. That was her joke back, right.

629
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,210
Like, you know, the first
thing they'd be here until

630
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,603
still a little like,

631
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,440
and what I interpreted
that or read into it, um,

632
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,230
is that Dang,
like,

633
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,450
it didn't take you much time to start
messing with me like that. You know? Like,

634
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:12,980
it's like,

635
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,970
oh, that's, that's what
she said. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

636
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:21,020
I think I was correct. I
felt it immediately and I
was like, Dang, I got to,

637
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:24,950
you got to be careful with that pen stuff.
If I said that to my brother,

638
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,480
you wouldn't carry.
This continues back to the book.

639
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:30,830
Contrary to popular belief,

640
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:34,790
yelling and yelling at and berating your
subordinates will not make them move

641
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:38,030
faster, nor will inspire
their loyalty. In fact,

642
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:41,000
it may encourage them to
begin plotting your demise.

643
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,580
Many years from now, your subordinates
will not remember what deadlines were met,

644
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:48,950
what sales were closed,
what products were shipped,

645
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:52,670
or what training schedules were executed.
What they remember is how you,

646
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,290
the leader treated them.

647
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,030
Whether you inspired a climate of trust
and dignity or ruled through fear,

648
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,900
metrics and intimidation.
It's interesting

649
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,770
and again, that's, that's
something that I don't do.

650
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Like I might take jabs at people in
a fun way that sometimes are not as

651
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,940
interpreted as fun as I want them to,
but they don't yell at people.

652
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,590
I don't berate them. Uh, don't do anything
like that and do this is 100% right.

653
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:26,020
When you see people like
that, it's not good. And I,

654
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,560
when I started on this work working
with civilians, I think they actually,

655
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,300
people actually thought I was going to
come and yell and scream. Yeah. You know?

656
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,930
And I'd be like, no, I laugh.

657
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:41,420
And I used to be like a leaf when
we worked together for 18 months.

658
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:45,670
How many times did I raise my voice at
you? And He'd be like, zero. And we read,

659
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,660
sometimes you make the audience
guests, you know, or whatever.

660
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,910
And Lafe always cracks the joke of like,

661
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,810
there's a lot of times he wanted to
yell at me, but you know, we, you know,

662
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:55,250
like that doesn't work.

663
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

664
00:40:57,211 --> 00:41:01,980
That is interesting how people think
that you're going to do that. I know.

665
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,760
Uh, maybe be, maybe
that's good. Maybe. Yeah,

666
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:08,490
maybe that's kind of part of the whole
thing. The whole picture, you know?

667
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,350
Why did they think that?

668
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,350
Maybe because you yell and scream at
other situations. I don't though. Well,

669
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,990
I have a few videos of you yelling and
screaming, yelling and screaming, Ward,

670
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,600
I don't know.
Stuff.

671
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,110
You get into other stuff. You don't
never yell and scream at someone.

672
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,640
Oh you mean like, I'm like, oh okay.
Well that's a little bit, yeah.

673
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,190
If I'm raising my voice is
being a bit more poignant.

674
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,550
Escalated. Yeah. Escalated.
That's not screaming though. Yeah.

675
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,970
So that's not yelling and
screaming at someone, you know. No.

676
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,770
So maybe they just like fuel that there.
That's a lot of um,

677
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:50,050
fire coming from this guy and he's real
effective in leading people in hard,

678
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,990
intense situations so that maybe
they just draw that connection.

679
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:58,150
Maybe it's weird. It's the movies
make it too. Yeah, cause yeah.

680
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,490
People are yelling and boot camp.

681
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,400
Here we go to another
thing from west point.

682
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,520
This is a show fields major general
John show fields of civil war fame.

683
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,200
This is his definition of discipline.
So now this is this,

684
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:19,370
this is cool because we're talking
about a guy from the civil war, right?

685
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:24,560
Here we go. The discipline which makes
the soldiers have a free country,

686
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:28,610
reliable and battle is not to be
gained by harsher tyrannical treatment.

687
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,340
On the contrary, such treatment is far
more likely to destroy then make an army.

688
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,780
It is possible to impart instructions
and to give commands in such a manner and

689
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:42,320
in such a tone of voice as to
inspire in the soldier. No feeling,

690
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,690
but an intense desire to obey.

691
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:50,090
While the opposite manner and tone
of voice cannot fail to excite strong

692
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:53,510
resentment and a desire to Diso Bay.

693
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:54,910
Okay.

694
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:59,710
The one mode or other of dealing with
subordinates springs from a corresponding

695
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,970
spirit in the breast of the commander.
He who feels the respect,

696
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:05,020
which is do others,

697
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:09,280
cannot fail to inspire in
them regard for himself.

698
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,900
While he who feels enhance,
enhance of manifests,

699
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,060
disrespect towards others,

700
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:21,360
especially his inferiors cannot fail
to inspire hatred against himself.

701
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,341
So that again,

702
00:43:24,341 --> 00:43:28,990
that what's cool that might sound all
new world be that's written civil war,

703
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:34,870
civil war, right? That's old school
and he's still talking about,

704
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,980
hey, you got to respect your
people. You've got to treat
them well. That's a great,

705
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,160
that's a great definition of how to,
how to impose,

706
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,790
and I use that word aside. It's
you're not imposing. That's the point.

707
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,040
You're not imposing discipline,
you're,

708
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,870
you're opening the door and
showing the way and leading.

709
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,330
That's what you're doing. Cultivating an
environment of discipline. Yes, very much.

710
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,010
Very nice. I like that. Now he goes into
the various brands of toxic leaders. I'll,

711
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,890
I'll burn through these bully leaders,
those who inflict emotional pain,

712
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:08,570
delivered threats and ultimatums,

713
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,100
hurl insults and invalidate the opinions
of others. Narcissistic leaders,

714
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:15,740
those who are arrogant
and self congratulatory.

715
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,820
This brand of toxic leader will often
contrast his own abilities against a

716
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:23,810
subordinate shortcomings. Look at me.
I can do this so easily. Why can't you?

717
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,123
Okay.

718
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,770
Insular leaders,
this brand of leader forms,

719
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:34,771
clicks and to great lengths to ensure
that his followers are shielded and enjoy

720
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:38,880
special privileges. These are all
different brands of toxic leaders.

721
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,670
Hypocritical leaders is the
one you talked about earlier.

722
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,400
These leaders live by the mantra.
Do as I say,

723
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:48,090
not as I do and rarely
practice what they preach.

724
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,350
The hypocritical leader will hold
a subordinate to a high standard,

725
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,480
but won't apply that same
standard to himself. As a leader,

726
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:57,901
you should be.

727
00:44:57,901 --> 00:45:01,410
You should be applying a higher standard
to yourself then your people for sure.

728
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,403
Hmm.

729
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,860
Enforcement leaders. This is
interesting. Enforcement leaders.

730
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,980
This mid level leader seeks the approval
of his superiors without regard to his

731
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:15,940
subordinates welfare. He will
consciously follow orders that are bad,

732
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:20,830
unsafe, or illegal only to stay in the
good graces of the organizational culture.

733
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,470
That's bad. Those guys, those are
bad leaders. See Him in the military.

734
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,470
They're just, they only lead. They only,

735
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,740
they only do what they're
told to look good,

736
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,860
but everyone hates him
and it's interesting,

737
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,020
like you talk to someone that was
above in the chain of command.

738
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,180
I think all that guy's a
great guy. Yeah. He was super.

739
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:44,230
Have you talked to someone who's both?
I hate that guy. Isn't that funny that,

740
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:46,870
that, that, that Schofields definition.

741
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,770
He said you cannot fail
to inspire your hatred.

742
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,720
Hatred. Yeah, sure thing. Treat
people with district. You know that,

743
00:45:55,721 --> 00:46:00,130
that you know what that is? I think that
is psychologically, right? Human beings,

744
00:46:00,131 --> 00:46:04,750
we want to be free. We want
to have, we want to determine
our our path, right? Sure.

745
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:10,000
When you take that away from
someone and just crush it,

746
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,460
they Dave, they spike you for it and they
hate you for it. Whereas if you can say,

747
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:18,250
look, you can do this. You can execute
this mission. How you want Echo Charles,

748
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,130
you can do what you want.
Here's the goal.

749
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,390
You figured out a way as opposed to here's
how you're going to do everything my

750
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,224
way.

751
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,570
Next one, callous leader in similar
vein to the enforcement lead,

752
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:34,390
the Callus leader has a blatant
disregard for his subordinates,

753
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:38,950
welfare or desires.
Credit hog leaders,

754
00:46:38,951 --> 00:46:40,010
these leaders show exists,

755
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,200
show their toxicity by taking credit
for an employee success or contribution.

756
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,710
They resent the notion of giving
credit where credit is due.

757
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,210
Blame shifting leaders.

758
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:54,720
The mirror image of the credit
hog is the blame shifter.

759
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,010
This leader is quick to point the finger
for anything that goes wrong and many

760
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:02,670
times he actively looks for someone
whom he can assign the blame,

761
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,491
the blame shifter.

762
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:08,700
We'll often maliciously accused someone
of wrongdoing without evidence or

763
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:12,660
probable cause. That's a person that
does not take extreme ownership.

764
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,150
Hmm. Bunch of toxic leaders
that he talks about it

765
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,790
there.
Here's another

766
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,250
thing he talks about.
As a leader of any stripe,

767
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:30,160
you cannot simply give orders and expect
your subordinates to them blindly.

768
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,720
To the contrary,

769
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:36,870
you must establish a clear
intent addressing the why
and the desired end state.

770
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,530
It will never suffice for a leader to say,

771
00:47:41,531 --> 00:47:44,620
because I said so as a
reason for performing tasks.

772
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,420
If you can't justify the
rationale of an order to yourself,

773
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,280
don't make your subordinates do it.

774
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Reevaluate your reasons
and find another method.

775
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,900
Have you ever said that as a parent?
Because I said yeah,

776
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,090
every once in a while you got to
bust that. Oh No, no. It's stupid.

777
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,230
It doesn't make sense to do that.
And when you say everyone's,

778
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,920
while you've got a busted out, like, like
safe emergency situation, hey we look,

779
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:15,090
I'm telling you, you just can put
your shoes on. We gotta go like, yeah,

780
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,620
because I said so. Yeah. I mean
that's, that's what happens.

781
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,860
And you know what happens in the military
too where you don't always have time.

782
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,420
You know, if you're in a, if you're in a
combat situation, you know you can't say,

783
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,950
hey take that building over there and
the reason why I want you to do that

784
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:32,320
because blah blah blah. You
don't have time to do that. So,

785
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,160
but you have trust with your subordinates
and they know where you're coming from

786
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:37,990
and all that.
Interesting.

787
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:43,050
So really when you really break it
down is you never want to do that ever.

788
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,420
Because I said to him ever, but life's
not perfect. Well this is, this is the,

789
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,210
this is another thing that Leif and I
talk about is there's times definitely

790
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:59,530
where I was like life hit that building
over there and this is what's cool.

791
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,980
There's also times,
cause I was the guy that wasn't in,

792
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,690
there was also times where life
looked at me and said, Hey Jocko move,

793
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,070
you're out the Humvee over there.
And I was like,

794
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:07,780
Oh okay cause he needs me to do something.

795
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:11,200
So we have a mutually
supporting relationship.

796
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,870
It's not about like,
Hey,

797
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:16,540
I'm the one that's out here
barking all the orders we're doing.

798
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,220
We're trying to get something
accomplished together.

799
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,810
And if he told me to do something,
I know he's got a good reason why.

800
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,390
Because if he had time to tell
me why, he would tell me, hey,

801
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:28,110
can you put your Humvee over there
cause we're gonna about to, you know,

802
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,010
move guys out in this book,
whatever, Blah Blah, blah, blah.

803
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,990
I'm need to hear all that. Unless, unless
I've got my or Humvee there for reason.

804
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:37,030
And now he's saying to me like, Hey,
move your home for you. Hey, hold up.

805
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,030
I've got good coverage down this
road. Oh, okay. I didn't see that.

806
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,250
Can you push it back eight feet?
Yeah, we can move it. Okay, cool.

807
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,300
You know what I mean? So it's, it's
good we were cruising like that.

808
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,680
Yeah. But that's, it's,

809
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,480
but as far as like the actual
dynamics of why you shouldn't say,

810
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,000
because I said so because it's not,
in your case,

811
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:59,060
let's say you don't have time
to explain why. Right. And you,

812
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:03,670
they just say, hey, move the Humvee.
Right. And you move the Humvee still.

813
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:08,620
Even if he didn't explain why the
reasons still isn't because I said so.

814
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:12,250
And you know that
the reason,

815
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,270
the reason is because there's some
tactical situation that's unfolding that,

816
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:19,810
yeah, of course. Yeah. So it's one of
those things where ultimately you never,

817
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:23,200
it never, you never should be like,
because I said so never really should,

818
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,770
but in the event of not having
time to explain or whatever,

819
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:30,560
even there's an explanation needed
in the event of that ever happening,

820
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,670
you need to kind of build trust.
Yes.

821
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,640
So you can kind of alleviate that for the,
for the lack of time or whatever.

822
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:42,020
What I explained to people when I talk
about life and I on the battlefield that

823
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:46,400
we had trust with each other. So if we,
you know, if I said to do something,

824
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,090
he'd do it and know that I
had a good reason for it.

825
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,350
If he told me to do something,

826
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,330
I would do it because I know
he had a good reason for it.

827
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,080
And then later on he'd say, yeah, you
know, I need to do that, move that Humvee.

828
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:59,490
Cause we had, we were blocking the fields
of fire front inside this building.

829
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:01,730
Like oh okay cool. Yeah. That's
why I moved it. We're all good.

830
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:07,060
So without that trust being built w

831
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:14,050
and you put that on top of my expectation
of you to just follow my order without

832
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:19,850
asking why as a parent or
whatever that is wrong.

833
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,410
It's what you're saying under you
should not say that should not be uh,

834
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,190
leading slash parenting and,
and also you got to remember,

835
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,750
you can get away with
it for a little while,

836
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:34,130
like a new chief checks into a silk
tune. He says, hey guys, you know,

837
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,820
do this. The guys are going to do it.
Yeah, they're going to do it. There's,

838
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,200
there is a chain of command,
there is a rank structure. Yeah.

839
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,990
But if that's the persistent
methodology of leadership,

840
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,390
it's not going to work for long term.
That's what you got to remember.

841
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,880
And when you do occasionally say that,

842
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:52,130
like when I would say to
my guys to do something,

843
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,880
they do it like they do it because they,

844
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,720
because it was so seldom that I would
utilize like some sort of the a k do this

845
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:05,570
now.
I would very rarely exercise that,

846
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,700
that power over the guys.
And it would probably,

847
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:12,680
I mean I'm just assuming now,
but,

848
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:17,890
and it's probably because you never
went to the because I said so.

849
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,830
Yes, no, no. Yeah, I don't think I,

850
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,740
I don't think I actually ever said that.
So the less,

851
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:29,300
even in situations where I would want
to say like snakes sometimes I'm right,

852
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:33,800
sometimes I'm right, you're wrong.
And I would, I remember there was a,

853
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:38,330
we're running a block of training and
the guys pulled out this certain element

854
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:42,020
of training and I said,
hey,

855
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:45,320
why did you pull out this
element of training? And
they're like, well, you know,

856
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:49,220
they had some, they gave
their reasons which were all
wrong and I, and I was like,

857
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,740
I was like, well no, here's,

858
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,470
here's the reasons why you're wrong
there and you're wrong there and you're

859
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:59,150
wrong there. But they were kind of adamant
and I wanted to just say like, Hey,

860
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,090
shut up and do what I'm telling you to do.
You put that,

861
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,980
put that element of
training back in there now.

862
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,940
And I held myself back from doing
that and I'm glad I did. Of course.

863
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:11,030
I'm glad I did because, because,
because here's the deal.

864
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,520
If you're right and you can articulate it,

865
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:16,490
I mean eventually I just took me more
time to explain to the guys, hey look,

866
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:20,060
that element of training,
it might not be happening right now,

867
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:24,200
but it could very easily happen again
in the future. Here's some examples.

868
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,530
Here's some places we are the world.

869
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:28,860
Here's other elements that are out there
that are doing that same thing right

870
00:53:28,861 --> 00:53:30,720
now that we could easily get folded into.

871
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,490
So we need to continue to do that type of
training. And they were like, yeah, okay,

872
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:40,440
make sense? But that was, you know, that
took 20 minutes. That took 20 minutes.

873
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,100
I knew I was right. 100% no, no, no,

874
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:47,880
no doubt in my military mind at
all. I wanted to just say, hey,

875
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,610
shut up and put the element back
of training. Still didn't do it,

876
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:55,740
but I didn't do it. [inaudible]
that's how I want to do it. So really,

877
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,230
almost ironically,

878
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,870
the less that you do
say because I said so,

879
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,120
the more you can. Yes,
absolutely. Just what I just
said before. The more you talk,

880
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:13,050
the less people listen. It's the same
thing. Yeah. You demand people do things.

881
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:16,290
The less you can demand of them. The
last few demand people, the more you can

882
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,350
use that tool very sparingly as a
leader, very sparingly. And you know,

883
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,870
you kind of went down that rabbit hole.
But this one,

884
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:27,480
if you can't do this other thing, going
back to the book, I already read it,

885
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:27,991
but I'll read it again.

886
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,660
If you can't justify the
rationale of an order to yourself,

887
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:32,130
don't make your subordinates to do it.

888
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,390
This is something I get asked all the
time. They're like, well woof, woof,

889
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,710
and they told you to do something.

890
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,380
Did you do want to do with the Judean
think was right. I wouldn't do it. Hmm.

891
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,110
They're like, well, really? It's like,
yeah, of course. Really? And here's the,

892
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:48,510
this is what they don't realize.
They think that everyone in the military,

893
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:51,390
he's like running around giving orders
that are stupid and don't make any sense.

894
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:55,110
That's not true. You know, when I got told
to do things that didn't make sense of,

895
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:58,590
one good example of that was was taken
Iraqis with us on the battlefield and

896
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:01,380
they were saying we had to take a ratio
of like seven to one or whatever the

897
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,460
ratio was at the time. And it
didn't make sense. And I said, no,

898
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,870
we're not going to do that. And I ran up
the chain of command. They're like, yeah,

899
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:09,480
you're right. Doesn't make sense. You
don't have to do it. Take what you can.

900
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:10,940
And we were like, okay,
cool. Well there's a,

901
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,890
there's a perfect example of me and been
like, you know, I'm carrying the line.

902
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:16,380
I'm a company guy,
I'm all on board for the big win.

903
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,530
But if you tell me to do something
that's stupid, I'm not going to do it.

904
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,660
You know, it's funny I heard that
about you. What'd you hear that? That,

905
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,210
that's one of my friends.
You see, we know him,

906
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:31,050
but he'd be like, Jocko.
So such a bad ass.

907
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,580
Who would like the way he talks to the
superiors is like, it's so gangster.

908
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,210
They'll be like, he was like, no, we're
not going to do that. Doesn't make sense.

909
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:42,780
You know, whatever. And now
that you're explaining it to me,

910
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:47,370
it makes more sense because I wouldn't
be that gang in their mind. They're like,

911
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:49,560
oh my gosh. Yeah, because I would
be explaining it to them, you know?

912
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:54,300
And you gotta be very careful that
you're not coming across as arrogant,

913
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:56,100
that you're not coming
across as know it all.

914
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:59,070
Which sometimes I would have a tendency
to come across like that and I had to be

915
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:01,770
very careful. I had to check myself
sometimes because you want to,

916
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:03,810
it's the same thing.
There's like you just like you want,

917
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:04,830
I want to tell my subordinates,

918
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:06,660
like shut up and put that element
of training back in there.

919
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,960
You want to tell you your superiors the
same thing and you know, hey, shut up.

920
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:11,820
That's a dumb idea.
But you can't do that.

921
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,400
And all you're going to do then is what
you're going to do is you're gonna make

922
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:17,160
them mad at you. That same thing that
he did, I just talked about going down.

923
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:21,960
The chain of command goes up the chain
of command to, so if, if I treat,

924
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:25,030
if you're my boss and I
treat you with disrespect,

925
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,900
you're going to hate me and it's going
to work out worse for me because I'm on

926
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:33,180
the bottom side of that. That little
pyramid we've built. Yeah. So you,

927
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,540
when I would talk to guys,

928
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:36,550
to my superiors and say that
something doesn't make sense,

929
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:40,270
I would do in a very respectful way.
And again,

930
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,450
I had to be careful because sometimes,
especially people that didn't know me,

931
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:48,100
if you didn't know me, maybe that usually
the people that didn't know me well,

932
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,590
I might come across as more
arrogant, you know? And which is bad.

933
00:56:50,591 --> 00:56:52,990
I'm not saying that that's bad.
I wish I wouldn't,

934
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,710
but if I didn't believe in something,
I wasn't going to do it.

935
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,170
And I wasn't gonna be a jerk about it.
But I like, Hey, here's what's going on.

936
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,900
If we take these number of guys in
the field with this many Iraqis,

937
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:03,790
we're not going to have all the people
that we should have in the field to be

938
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:05,890
safe. You know, you're talking
about leaving behind a corpsman.

939
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,810
You're talking about leaving
behind a a radio man.

940
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:10,720
You're talking about leaving behind
a a close air support fires guy.

941
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:13,630
Those are the guys I can't go on the
field without or someone could get killed

942
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:17,020
and the the up the chain of command.
I was like, you're right, cool.

943
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:20,170
And then this didn't happen again.
There would be occasional things,

944
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:23,350
but it doesn't happen all the time where
people are giving you stupid orders.

945
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:26,770
My bosses didn't give me dumb, didn't
tell me to do dumb things. Yeah,

946
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,460
and I'm sure that's kind of what
sometimes they told me to do dumb things,

947
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:32,450
but they were a little dumb things
and you don't have to do the datum.

948
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,330
We did a little pawn things.
You want to do something,

949
00:57:35,331 --> 00:57:37,360
you want me to do something stupid
but it's small and small and stupid.

950
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:42,180
I'll do it and I'll save my, my
objections to things that actually matter.

951
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,560
Yeah, it makes sense. It
goes back to that paper.

952
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,780
No life talks about doing paperwork
and I was at maybe, you know,

953
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:48,850
we don't want to do paperwork and I'm like
hey we're gonna do the best paperwork.

954
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:50,830
Cause it's a little thing, we don't
care about it. You don't want to,

955
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:53,110
so we've got to stay up an extra hour
and do some paperwork. Who Cares?

956
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:54,790
We're going to build that trust.

957
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,740
And that way when we'd come
time to say no for real,

958
00:57:56,741 --> 00:58:00,470
we'll be able to say no for real and
the bosses will listen to us. Yeah.

959
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,380
I'm sure that that added to the whole
cache though. You know, where were,

960
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,220
when you did say something or did
push back or whatever it would see,

961
00:58:08,221 --> 00:58:09,850
you'd still get the results,
you know,

962
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:13,810
where someone who may not understand
that fleet as much as you did.

963
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:17,600
They just witness kind of that kind
of the end and be like Dang Jack who's

964
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,210
Gainesville. Yeah. You make this
stuff happen up the chain. Yeah.

965
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,810
Cause cause you know, cause to my
guys I might be like, hey guys,

966
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:27,700
we're not doing that. I'd be like, we're
not doing that. And then be like, oh shit.

967
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:28,534
And then I go to the,

968
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,830
go to the boss's office and debrief Macer
I'm just wondering about this plan we

969
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,680
got here. I have to do it. Here's
an electric I met, I'd come back.

970
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:42,640
So yeah, maybe that is, you
know, level three gangster.

971
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,410
All right,
here's another one.

972
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:52,180
Leaders stay informed of current events
and they should anticipate challenges

973
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:56,290
based on those events. Just be be informed
of what's happening. That makes sense.

974
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,990
Here's some other west
point lessons learned.

975
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,400
I was able to function
mentally and physically in
top form with only five to six

976
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:07,780
hours of sleep a night.
Just saying take that for what it's worth.

977
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,150
I don't advocate sleep deprivation,

978
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:13,060
but I'm just saying there's an example
there that you might want to listen to.

979
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,000
Another thing that he
learned at West Point read.

980
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,950
I love to read books and have an have
since a very young age at west point.

981
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,310
I discovered a magnificent

982
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,590
library loaded with books on
military history in leadership.

983
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,170
Ever since then for
more than 60 years now,

984
00:59:27,171 --> 00:59:31,040
I've been fascinated by the study of
leadership, military, political business,

985
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,870
the athletic,
et Cetera,

986
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,710
and within that a focused
interest in why leaders fail.

987
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,410
Remember a good leader as a lifelong
learner who continually studies to perfect

988
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:43,244
his craft.

989
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,520
It's interesting to hear these
great leaders read, you know, again,

990
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:54,380
General Madison is the classic
5,000 books in his personal library.

991
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,660
Hopefully we can get him on the podcast
to discuss some of his favorite books.

992
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:05,780
Okay. After he graduates from West
Point, he missed World War II.

993
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:10,220
He goes to Japan and he's
in the occupation of Japan.

994
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:11,271
Back to the book,

995
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:16,271
I was flown up to Japan in October of
1945 and was sent north on a train on the

996
01:00:17,871 --> 01:00:22,871
11th airborne divisions jump school
or for the 11th airborne division jump

997
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:25,640
school,
arriving in Tokyo central train station.

998
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,180
I was struck by the cleanliness of the
place and by the hundreds of Japanese

999
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:32,270
soldiers in uniform sitting on floors,
leaning against walls,

1000
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:37,390
all on armed no weapons and showing
no anger toward American soldiers.

1001
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,500
UH, Japanese rail conductors showed me to
a spotless alcove with a short bunk and

1002
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:43,334
clean sheets.

1003
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,870
The train left on time and I arrived
in the next morning exactly on time.

1004
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:50,570
He was my observation.
These people,

1005
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:55,571
we're six weeks out of a five year war
and they had already began cleaning up

1006
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,680
and disciplining their services. When
they get back on their feet, watch out.

1007
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,590
Even in the midst of defeat.

1008
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,820
Carry yourself professionally
and maintain your discipline.

1009
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,030
That is the quickest way towards recovery.
Interesting story.

1010
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,360
The Japanese.
So we just lost a five year war.

1011
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:22,010
We got atomic bombs dropped
on us. Guess what? Okay,

1012
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:26,420
we lost sign. Unconditional
surrender. Unconditional surrender.

1013
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:30,350
That means you have nothing. You have
no power. Zero nothing. Unconditional.

1014
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,040
Unconditional surrender. You know what?
Keep your uniforms on B squared away.

1015
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,520
Get the trains running. Clean
this place up. We got to get back.

1016
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,560
We gotta get back together.
Got To get back in the game.

1017
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:43,550
It's kind of like if a girl
breaks up with you, right? No,

1018
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,970
it's not an unconditional surrender
saying the surrender part.

1019
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:50,930
I'm saying the clean yourself up.
Clean yourself up. For sure. For sure.

1020
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,460
For sure. For sure. If
you get back in the gym,

1021
01:01:56,170 --> 01:02:01,130
it's the reading develops.
You go when you're, when
you're, no, you're 100% right.

1022
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,160
You are right.
When you are defeated,

1023
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,340
the best thing you can do
is maintain your discipline.

1024
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,120
That's the best thing you can do.
Maintain your discipline. Yeah.

1025
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,000
You'd be surprised how quick
he get back on your feet.

1026
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,010
There's very few people.
The only, some are, the

1027
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:25,010
reason they're they're jammed
up is because they're not
paying attention things.

1028
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:27,950
They should be paying
attention to them like they're,

1029
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,980
they're working out 17 hours a day and
not paying attention to their family.

1030
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,560
Those are sometimes those
guys get into scrubs. Right,

1031
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,730
and I kind of got to say,
look man,

1032
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,840
you're in good shape. You need to
spend some time with your, you know,

1033
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,790
with your wife,
with your kids.

1034
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:50,300
Give a little bit back cause that that
happens. The team guys sometimes, yeah.

1035
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,000
Gotta be careful that one, we're, we're,

1036
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:56,940
we tend to be workaholics and the work
is so fond that it just like can take

1037
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:00,000
over everything. Wait till, so
what does that, how does that,

1038
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:04,700
does that contribute to their recovery
in other situations? Well, let me,

1039
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:09,150
let's just say there's a family problem
going on, right? And so what does the guy,

1040
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:12,180
dude, he's, he's, he's in
the game, right? He's, well,

1041
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:13,170
he's going to work out even more.

1042
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,540
He's going to go to Jujitsu or
even more when what he's doing,

1043
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,540
he's not helping the problem. You
see what I'm saying? This is the,

1044
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,010
most people don't have that,

1045
01:03:20,011 --> 01:03:23,270
but most people have the opposite problem
when they get down, when they get down,

1046
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,590
they go, oh, you know, I don't
feel like we're going to own,

1047
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:28,110
I'm just going to drink and
eat pizza and donuts. Right.

1048
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:31,680
That's what most people do.
A lot of time seals will be like,

1049
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,980
I'm not feeling good. Cool. I'm
gonna work out harder. You know?

1050
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:39,890
Oh my family is not fun right now.
Cool. The gym is fine, two is fine.

1051
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,510
I'll go surfing on a nine day trip.
Dang.

1052
01:03:42,511 --> 01:03:46,920
That's like a feedback loop
kind of. Right. In a way.

1053
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,600
So it's like okay there's
an issue with my girlfriend.

1054
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,760
I'll make it less serious when the issue
with my girlfriend girlfriend's giving

1055
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:57,750
me grief of whatever I'm not around or
something like that or I'm not sensitive

1056
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,850
to her feelings.
You know how I'm going to deal with that.

1057
01:03:59,851 --> 01:04:01,930
I'm going to go work out guys.

1058
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,110
Which makes the problem worse now
because you're paying attention less.

1059
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:07,640
Even less sensitive to her
girlfriend is the one thing though.

1060
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:10,110
The wife is another thing.
Yeah cause the girlfriend,

1061
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:11,030
the guy would be like my uncle,

1062
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,000
the wife has a different scenario because
they got kids and the big different,

1063
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,790
you just use your example wasn't
good cause you, you took a big,

1064
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,260
you took what you thought was a
small step but it is a big step too.

1065
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,570
There's too much of a difference than
the different, an example, same example,

1066
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,820
wife and kids as opposed to girlfriend,
but yeah, feedback loop. Yeah. Yeah. Your,

1067
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:35,220
this is what I'm saying instead of
instead of the guy going because normal

1068
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:38,670
person, good middle about feeling good
cause my cause, my wife, my girlfriend,

1069
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,760
un-normal guy. It's like, hey well
you need to get back in the gym,

1070
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:43,560
get your game together,
get up early,

1071
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,800
get on the program and
they'll start feeling good
and they'll start feeling good

1072
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,530
about themselves and then they'll start
being a better person and being a better

1073
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:52,170
husband. You say that to a team
guy and they're like, okay cool.

1074
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,670
I'll work out in 19 hours a day and
the other five will be doing Jujitsu

1075
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:02,190
or whatever.
Next,

1076
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:05,820
a good leader studies the culture of any
location where he's planning to go and

1077
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:08,670
insures his subordinates are
properly educated on the same.

1078
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,140
Here's a good one when in charge,
take charge,

1079
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:18,460
but treat your subordinates with
respect and dignity and common courtesy.

1080
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,260
Here's another one.
Oh,

1081
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:23,890
workers performance often reflects
the attitude of his leadership.

1082
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,320
If you want something done,
ask nicely.

1083
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:29,560
If a subordinate for guests to perform
a task, don't take it personally.

1084
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,550
Just remind them nicely in any
organization, everyone has a to do list.

1085
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,200
While juggling these tasks.

1086
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:38,140
Some things will never be fall
through the cracks when this happens.

1087
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:40,330
Don't assume that the
subordinates and lazier, stupid,

1088
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,730
simply reengage them on the task and if
necessary, emphasize why it's a priority.

1089
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,170
If a subordinate performs a task and
the outcome is not what you expected,

1090
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,210
don't attack their
intelligence or character.

1091
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:56,170
Politely explained the deficiencies and
offer an idea for solution suborn it's

1092
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:59,560
quickly lose respect for a leader
who is all problem and no solution.

1093
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:06,090
Speaking of problems, wherever possible,
solve problems at the lowest level.

1094
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:08,790
When leaders are confronted
with disciplinary problems,

1095
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:11,670
be it willful disobedience.
Negligence are honest mistakes.

1096
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:15,450
They must resolve these problems at the
lowest level before raising the issue to

1097
01:06:15,451 --> 01:06:16,710
higher echelons.

1098
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,230
If the problem can be fixed and
remedy instituted at lower levels,

1099
01:06:22,231 --> 01:06:24,510
it will benefit your relationship
with your subordinates.

1100
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,620
Improve the health of the organization
and not divert higher level resources

1101
01:06:28,621 --> 01:06:31,680
away from their priorities. Solve things
at the lowest I've, well that's, yeah,

1102
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:35,850
that's, I used to say this
exact same thing to my guys,
especially when it, well,

1103
01:06:35,851 --> 01:06:37,980
when it came to anything,
but the topic would come up.

1104
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,300
A lot of guys getting in trouble. Mm
Kay. If a guy gets in trouble, solve it,

1105
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:46,200
like solve it at your level.
And if you,

1106
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,810
and if you don't think you can contain it,
tell me,

1107
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:51,160
what do you mean get in trouble?
Like, oh, guy gets in trouble often.

1108
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:54,330
Do you get to New York? Well, Dui is a
pretty big one, but I got to go fight.

1109
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:58,470
I get to do a fight out in
town. Hey, if you can, hey,
you can punish them. You know,

1110
01:06:58,471 --> 01:07:00,420
the platoon chief hears about it
and the platoon chief who says,

1111
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:01,303
I'm going to punish him,

1112
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:04,860
he's going to be doing brass pickup
or whatever he's going to do in some

1113
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,490
cleaning the military vehicles.
There's always want, you know,

1114
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,200
one of the best oil wax, the six
by, yeah. Um, that, that's the,

1115
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:13,260
that you can handle it there.

1116
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:17,480
You don't need to tell the platoon
commanders platoon, uh, the,

1117
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,800
the task unit commander now, it could
be different if the guy gets in a fight.

1118
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,653
Now he gets arrested.

1119
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,700
Cause now we're going to hear about it
because they're going to find out the

1120
01:07:26,701 --> 01:07:29,250
guy's military. They're going to want
to know, contact the chain of command,

1121
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:32,520
because that's what they do.
That's their, that's their policy.

1122
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,640
And so now they're going to
contact the chain of command.

1123
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:39,450
So now can it be contained? That's the
question. If it can't be contained,

1124
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:43,560
then you've got to run it up the chain
of command because you don't want your

1125
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:47,800
boss to get, get hit. Uh, what's it
called? Blindsided, right? Yeah. Hey,

1126
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,360
one of your truck or one of your guys
was arrested. You know, yesterday.

1127
01:07:51,361 --> 01:07:55,260
Why didn't you tell me you don't want that
to happen? Yeah. If you can contain it,

1128
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:58,430
contain it. If you can't, you gotta you
gotta tell the chain of command. Yeah.

1129
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,560
But you should try and contain it.
Be like, hey, we got it handled.

1130
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,530
Boston was a guy who got in trouble
yesterday. Here's the punishment.

1131
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:07,500
I'd dealt out. And here's what we're,
you know, here's where we're at.

1132
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,910
No one wants to be the senior guy with
a secret of, you've heard that before.

1133
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,280
Senior guy with the guy with a secret

1134
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:21,770
meaning meaning if you did something
wrong and, and I find out about it,

1135
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,230
that means I'm,

1136
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:30,000
I have the secret now and if I'm above
you in the chain of command and now my

1137
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:31,860
boss finds out,
well now I'm going to get in trouble.

1138
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,760
So it's be the easiest way for me
to do it is to be like, hey boss,

1139
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,870
echo did this wrong. He got in trouble
and then my boss now has the secret.

1140
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:44,190
You guys, are you going to tell his mood
this fully? Right. That's like the friend,

1141
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:44,850
you know,

1142
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:49,850
who catches his friend's girlfriend or
something cheating on him and it's like

1143
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:54,450
shoot, I don't want to do, I
want to ruin the relationship.

1144
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:56,760
Or you know that relationship is
already ruined too. You're right.

1145
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,000
That's not a good example.
Maybe that cheating.

1146
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,960
Cause there was a movie called,
I think it was called this. Yeah.

1147
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,480
I don't know if it was called the secret,

1148
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:09,870
but that's what it was predicated
on and so that's the whole thing.

1149
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:14,730
He didn't want to put it this way. If he
told if he was, if you'd tell the secret,

1150
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,590
he would like,
I dunno,

1151
01:09:16,591 --> 01:09:20,700
ruined some relationship and if he
didn't it was like they'd be fine,

1152
01:09:20,701 --> 01:09:23,700
but you're the senior with a secret.
Then of course at the end of the movie,

1153
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:28,680
you know they, they find out, you
know the big reveal. Who is that?

1154
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:33,500
Vince Vaughn was in it. Anyway,
talk to someone else about that.

1155
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,070
To have your own podcast echoed
movie though. Reviews a little bit.

1156
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:43,050
It's the same concept I'm telling you.
Praise in public, punish in private.

1157
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,870
I think everyone knows about that.
Here's some,

1158
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:49,920
here's some other left lessons he learned
when he was a occupying force in Japan.

1159
01:09:49,921 --> 01:09:51,210
Be Confident but not arrogant.

1160
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:56,970
Self confidence and humility are
the keys to getting any job done.

1161
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,780
Little dichotomy in those two.
Obviously there's always a way.

1162
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,380
Either you find a way or you make one.
If you can't think of a way,

1163
01:10:04,381 --> 01:10:06,450
don't hesitate to ask for help.

1164
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,760
Take counsel from those who have
information and experiences.

1165
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,700
So funny how some people
won't ask for help,

1166
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,050
supervise checkup on things,
but don't micromanage.

1167
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,650
Make sure your subordinates
understand their priorities of work.

1168
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,980
May need these. I, I'm, I'm, I'm a,

1169
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,470
I just realized I was almost
reading those as if like, hey,

1170
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:31,310
we already know these things. It's like
these are things that we know. Not that,

1171
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,630
not that they're not important and
obviously how more new and before I did,

1172
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,420
he learned them in the
occupation of Japan.

1173
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,710
Here he talks about
someone that he worked for.

1174
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,860
The officer under whom I served for
the longest period in Japan was Major

1175
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:53,330
Mansfield. He was always
cool, never raised his voice,

1176
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:58,700
very perceptive. Took no wooden
nickels and was a natural leader.

1177
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,170
He told me that what he wanted to be
done and let me run with the ball.

1178
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:08,480
He trusted me and I went an extra two to
three miles to make sure I would never

1179
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:12,560
let him down. Never do a shabby
job or never lose his trust.

1180
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,070
That right there is this. Like you could
just give that to people and say, Hey,

1181
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,530
think about this man. If you're
going to be in a leadership position,

1182
01:11:19,531 --> 01:11:22,680
think about this. Yeah, always
cool. Never raise your voice.

1183
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,260
Give people what you want to do
and let them run with the ball.

1184
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,130
Like that's just basic stuff,
but it's so important.

1185
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:33,270
What's a wooden nickel would Nicole is
it's, it's, it means, it means you take,

1186
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:37,350
you take things that aren't worth
anything. Oh yeah. It's fake. Fake.

1187
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,970
A couple more lessons learned.

1188
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:45,780
Tell your subordinate
leaders your standards at the
outset and what you expect.

1189
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:49,840
That's a pretty good one. If you let
people get away with stuff for awhile,

1190
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,170
then when you jerk the chain back,
it hurts them more.

1191
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:57,240
Push authority down to make decisions,
but keep responsibility for the results.

1192
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:58,980
Don't blame subordinates for bad results.

1193
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,370
Blame yourself for not training them
properly or giving poor instruction.

1194
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:06,300
Stream ownership. Boom. That's
another parenting one for sure.

1195
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,300
Always met well.
I see it and then I'll see.

1196
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,380
I feel like I've done a good job in being
conscious of this. You know how, okay,

1197
01:12:13,381 --> 01:12:18,090
so if I say Kay, so one year old, four
year old, four and a half or whatever,

1198
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:21,900
and I say, Hey, you know, watch him. I'm
going to go grab this thing from my car,

1199
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:26,210
whatever. Watch him. Don't let him
climb up on that bike and fold him.

1200
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:31,840
He's won. So I run in the, you
know, I come back of course,

1201
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:35,790
climb on the bike. Yeah,
falls down. Yeah. Hey,

1202
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:39,060
I thought I told you not to let you
tell the four year old, I know bread.

1203
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:42,630
That's what makes the example even
more powerful because look, hey look,

1204
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:46,830
her failure is my failure that
emphasize my failure even more.

1205
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,700
So for a year old, that's my
feeling. Yeah, same thing.

1206
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,790
Big Time check.

1207
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,460
Be Dead honest with those above
you and below you. Totally candid,

1208
01:12:59,461 --> 01:13:02,640
but not harsh, straight
talk. Respect your people.

1209
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,350
Taking care of your people is not
just about the obvious things.

1210
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:11,340
Pay working conditions concerned for
their welfare and that of their families,

1211
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:15,060
but seeing that they are properly trained
and have the personal discipline and

1212
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:17,070
desire to get the job
done and get it done well.

1213
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,823
Okay.

1214
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:22,160
Carry a notebook or three by five
cards and take notes when being given

1215
01:13:22,161 --> 01:13:25,040
instructions or when your boss is
explaining his philosophy or guidance on a

1216
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:25,874
matter.

1217
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:26,830
Okay.

1218
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:29,260
I also found that when running or
doing other physical exercises,

1219
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:31,720
ideas and useful faults
would pop into my head,

1220
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:34,300
possibly related in some medical way.

1221
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:38,950
Blood movement goes to the brain,
so I took scrawling notes when running.

1222
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:42,880
That's not a bad, I've done that before.
I'll be like working out and I'll,

1223
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:46,660
in my workout book I'll have a little
like four words of something I thought of

1224
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:50,980
or like, yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I
don't know if it's that interesting,

1225
01:13:50,981 --> 01:13:54,310
but it's worth noting. Oh
yeah. I mean if that's true,

1226
01:13:54,311 --> 01:13:56,830
you know like where like you're
carrying a notebook around now.

1227
01:13:56,831 --> 01:13:58,390
The nowadays put people
would notes in your phone.

1228
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:01,200
Do you put notes in your phone? Yes.
I put notes in my phone too. Yeah.

1229
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:05,920
Do you take voice memos? Sometimes? No.
I thought, I thought it was so cool,

1230
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:09,940
but I the habit didn't, didn't
stick and stick. Yeah. It's not bad.

1231
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,830
I usually type in the,
yeah,

1232
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,080
but sometimes if I'm driving
voice note. Yeah. Dang. Okay.

1233
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:22,120
Now he's a company commander in Korea,
so Korean War. So you know there's,

1234
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:26,410
again, we're jumping to this book, but
this is the, I thought this was awesome.

1235
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,950
He takes over as a,
as a company commander,

1236
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:35,670
one of my first acts as commanding officer
was to move six men out of the worst

1237
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:37,960
bores nest in the place.

1238
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:41,560
These mortar men had been
billeted in a derelict bunker,

1239
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,300
which was infested with rodents.

1240
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,280
I moved them into the officer's
bunks and I moved down there,

1241
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:51,010
moved us down there into
the first mortar old bunker.

1242
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,830
I had some Korean support troops
creek clean at first though,

1243
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,810
and it was very added,
adequate from my gunnery officer,

1244
01:14:56,811 --> 01:15:00,700
recon officer warrant officer and
myself, a few mice and bugs, but not bad.

1245
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:03,850
One quarter of my end was
dug into an old Korean grave,

1246
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:07,870
which was immediately covered,
but there's still a lingering odor.

1247
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:13,830
I keep my feet down at that
end and liberal use of an
aerosol bomb and open and

1248
01:15:14,081 --> 01:15:15,970
opening the door and it's
not bad sleeping at all.

1249
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,640
These graves are hard to avoid.
His tear scattered helter skelter.

1250
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:21,780
All of these hills where
our positions are. So what?

1251
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,700
I thought it was awesome about that.
He takes over as company command.

1252
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:28,930
These enlisted guys are living in this
crappy, stinky road and filled barracks.

1253
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,750
He kicks them out,
moves them into the officer's Barix.

1254
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:34,900
I moved the officers into the crappy
barracks. That's what I'm talking about.

1255
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:38,260
Okay?
That is legit.

1256
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,830
Some more points from Korea.
Good leaders.

1257
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:45,790
Don't wait for official permission to
try out a new idea in any organization.

1258
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,900
If you go looking for permission,

1259
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:50,380
you will inevitably find the one person
who thinks it's his job to say no.

1260
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,040
It's easier to get
forgiveness than permission.

1261
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,910
Put the welfare of your
own troops above your own,

1262
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:02,140
the eat before you eat.
They sleep before you sleep.

1263
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:07,480
Simple acts of courtesy and graciousness
and a profound impact on subordinates,

1264
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:09,520
morale,
self perception and performance.

1265
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:17,580
So every leader is put through an
informal process in the first few weeks

1266
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:19,150
wearing his people,
judge him,

1267
01:16:19,151 --> 01:16:22,450
and decide whether or not
he's worthy of their trust.

1268
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,920
He must earn their trust. How a leader
must prove himself by his actions,

1269
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:29,680
appearance, demeanor,
attitude, and decisions.

1270
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,740
I like that you're definitely getting
looked at when you take over something for

1271
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:34,570
the first time,
you're getting looked at hard.

1272
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,633
Hmm?

1273
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,960
The leader must be visible
on the battlefield.

1274
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:45,560
He must be in the battle battalion
commander on Down Brigade and division

1275
01:16:45,561 --> 01:16:46,550
commander.
On occasion.

1276
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:50,240
He must exhibit his determination to
prevail no matter what the odds are,

1277
01:16:50,241 --> 01:16:54,770
how desperate the situation he must
have and display the will to win by his

1278
01:16:54,771 --> 01:16:58,940
actions. Words, tone of voice on the
radio in face to face, his appearance,

1279
01:16:58,941 --> 01:17:01,130
his demeanor, his countenance,
and the look in his eyes.

1280
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:07,130
He must remain calm and cool. No
fear. He must ignore the dust,

1281
01:17:07,131 --> 01:17:10,340
the noise, the smoke, the explosions,
the, the wounded, the yells,

1282
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:13,250
or the deadline around them.
That is all normal,

1283
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:14,650
okay?

1284
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:18,190
He must never give off any hint or
evidence that he is uncertain about a

1285
01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:21,760
positive outcome,
even in the most desperate situations.

1286
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,930
So again, you know what you
brought up earlier of this. Hey,

1287
01:17:30,931 --> 01:17:32,210
we're not going to show any fear.

1288
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:36,300
We're not going to show any
possibility of ever losing, you know,

1289
01:17:36,301 --> 01:17:39,120
I don't think he's talking about that.
Uh,

1290
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,720
I think he's talking about even though
you might be thinking that I even know

1291
01:17:43,721 --> 01:17:45,220
you might give the indication,
hey look,

1292
01:17:45,221 --> 01:17:49,030
if we don't get our act together we could
lose this thing but we're not going to

1293
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:50,163
right.

1294
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,710
Some more Korea examples.

1295
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,190
I'd been taught for years that leaders
must set the example and I tried to do so,

1296
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,020
but in battle is absolutely mandatory
and especially so during the Korean War,

1297
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,160
at the company level,

1298
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:07,880
I learned that I could keep calm and
functional and the bedlam, stress, noise,

1299
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:11,420
blood and killings of a fierce battle.
I had no choice but to remain calm,

1300
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:16,790
stay in shape when we were not
in battle or another operation.

1301
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,790
I took a run in the later
afternoon for an hour or so.

1302
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:25,700
The first reports in the battlefield are
usually exaggerate for good or bad and

1303
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,930
are not entirely accurate.

1304
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:30,440
This is normal since they are sent back
by leaders and a moving battle in our

1305
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:35,240
fragmentary first reports are always
wrong. That's what we used to say,

1306
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:37,040
and that's usually pretty true.

1307
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:38,283
Hmm.

1308
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,740
Here's a good one.
Be ready so you don't have to get ready.

1309
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:48,670
A good leader will preposition as many
assets and people as he can before an

1310
01:18:48,671 --> 01:18:53,470
event, or is it a contingency
in case of disaster? Thus,

1311
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:57,010
when the alert and or
emergency inevitably comes,

1312
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,770
you'll be better prepared
to respond to it.

1313
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:02,560
Be ready so you don't have to get ready.

1314
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,590
He talked about when
things are quiet in here,

1315
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:14,270
he's talking about when things are quiet
on the line and nothing's going wrong.

1316
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,230
Tighten up security.
Be sure the listening outposts are alert,

1317
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,870
especially at night and in particularly
if it's raining or snowing,

1318
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:24,470
that's the most appropriate
time for the enemy to close in.

1319
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:30,110
It's interesting how he's talked about
that tall. He talks about it a bunch,

1320
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:33,890
but you know for him, when,
if there's nothing going on,

1321
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,110
do something right.
If you've got a day off,

1322
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:39,080
do something to make your position better.
If you're not getting attack, good,

1323
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:42,500
improve your position every moment
he's thinking about that. Yeah.

1324
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,610
When you draw up a plan
of attack or defense,

1325
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:53,300
you must have information on the
weather, terrain, an enemy capabilities,

1326
01:19:53,301 --> 01:19:56,000
but you cannot coordinate
your plan with the enemy.

1327
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,393
Okay.

1328
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:01,510
Therefore, you have to think
through all the what ifs.

1329
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:03,380
Okay.

1330
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,300
The enemy does this.
What happens if the enemy does that?

1331
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:08,040
What happens is time well
spent, we, I always say the

1332
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,300
enemy gets a vote and that's what he's
saying. Yeah. You, you can corner,

1333
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:12,061
you can make your plans,

1334
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:14,430
but your plans aren't coordinated with
what the enemy's going to do there and at

1335
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:18,180
the enemy's going to do at the end, he's
going to do, hmm. Soldiers in battle,

1336
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:22,230
fight, kill and die and die
primarily for each other.

1337
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,410
Okay.

1338
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,820
Don't complain to your boss.

1339
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:33,740
Yeah.

1340
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,660
He wants solutions,
not just problems.

1341
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,460
Okay.

1342
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,950
Right. Yeah. And that's
not just to your boss.

1343
01:20:41,951 --> 01:20:46,270
That's up and down the chain of
command. Yeah. Saving Private Ryan,

1344
01:20:46,271 --> 01:20:50,330
when he said you never gripe down the
chain of command. Yeah, definitely.

1345
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:54,740
I think there was a different point.
Use making buddy. Well, it's, it's, Oh,

1346
01:20:54,741 --> 01:20:57,340
I just set up or down chain going
and he's saying, don't gripe up. No,

1347
01:20:57,341 --> 01:21:00,500
he's saying don't gripe down.
Go Up. He's saying, yeah.

1348
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:04,630
What he's saying don't gripe up
and you're saying don't gripe down.

1349
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,250
And I'm saying don't gripe. Yeah. Yeah.

1350
01:21:06,251 --> 01:21:10,890
Well he's saying don't come and
complain to your boss. Yeah. Right.

1351
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:15,880
Yeah. Well, yeah. I, the way I took it on
saving private Ryan Anyway, it was great.

1352
01:21:15,881 --> 01:21:19,690
Meaning like I have a complaint about
this that I need the answer to kind of

1353
01:21:19,691 --> 01:21:22,380
thing. It's more of a comprehensive
thing that you can not see,

1354
01:21:22,381 --> 01:21:26,060
can not delineate the difference
between the Gripe and complain.

1355
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,270
They're the same thing.
Well,

1356
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,610
I feel like complaining because
it is a wonderful solution.

1357
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:34,200
Complete a complaint is might be a
little bit more formal than a gripe.

1358
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,960
Gripe is like, man, I can't
believe we're not getting,

1359
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:40,420
we're getting the same food again. Right?
Yeah. But it's also a complaint. Yeah.

1360
01:21:40,421 --> 01:21:43,060
I think you're right about now a
complaint could also be we are low on

1361
01:21:43,061 --> 01:21:46,210
ammunition. That's beyond a
complaint. Right? That's like,

1362
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:49,540
that's critical situation to gripe is
less. You think rape is a little bit less,

1363
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:51,320
but they're the same freaking thing.
Yeah.

1364
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:54,940
You shouldn't know either one of them
up or down the chain of you bring

1365
01:21:54,941 --> 01:21:56,740
solutions with you.
Okay, so they'll fill up.

1366
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,870
That is what I think was kind of like a,

1367
01:21:58,871 --> 01:22:02,640
given what I felt anyway and keeps
saving private Ryan. Meaning like, okay,

1368
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:03,230
if you have a,

1369
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:07,150
an official complaint like okay we need
to change this and then again you might

1370
01:22:07,151 --> 01:22:08,020
be right because he wants,

1371
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,900
he doesn't want you to do it down because
it makes you look like a weak leader

1372
01:22:10,901 --> 01:22:14,140
kind of thing. I'm assuming
with this he's saying, Hey,

1373
01:22:14,141 --> 01:22:18,430
don't just come with all your
complaints and no solutions to your,

1374
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:22,810
to your superiors cause the superiors and
want answers. They want solutions. Yeah.

1375
01:22:22,811 --> 01:22:27,010
Yeah. But when you gripe down the chain
of command there, there's two things.

1376
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,530
Number one, if you just complained
down the chain of command,

1377
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:33,610
then the guys are going to
take that and run with it.

1378
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:37,090
But that doesn't mean you don't explain
things down the chain of command it.

1379
01:22:37,091 --> 01:22:39,640
That doesn't mean you don't say,
hey guys, we're low on ammunition.

1380
01:22:39,641 --> 01:22:40,510
Here's what's going on.

1381
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:45,100
Our vessel transport got
hit in sunk by a torpedo.

1382
01:22:45,101 --> 01:22:47,910
They didn't deliver the ammo. We're
going to. Then people go, yeah,

1383
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:52,150
this lesson as opposed to
just the Cape leave. We don't
have enough ammo. Yes, yes,

1384
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:58,020
we don't have enough ammo. This is the
issue. Maybe that's kind of what he meant.

1385
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,470
That only goes up. I'm just
trying to think, but both of them,

1386
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,290
you have to tell your guys that you
don't have enough ammunition to say,

1387
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:05,980
hey guys,
we have enough ammunition.

1388
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,270
Here's what's going on. I put in for
more the the transport, God's sunk and,

1389
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,890
and this is the situation we're in.

1390
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:15,670
We need to use our ammo as sparingly as
possible. That's not a complaint. No.

1391
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:20,440
That's an explanation of what's going on
and a commander's intent about how much

1392
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:24,670
Amie ammunition and we're going to
use in conserving ammunition. Yeah.

1393
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:27,003
Check

1394
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:35,070
back to the book. We're
getting into Vietnam shortly
after 9:00 AM on June 29th,

1395
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:36,740
1964 I was handed the colors
of the second battalion,

1396
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,760
23rd infantry excepting the colors means
the commander is now responsible for

1397
01:23:44,341 --> 01:23:48,620
all his command does or fails to do.
Yeah.

1398
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:51,720
Once you're in charge,
you're responsible for everything.

1399
01:23:56,350 --> 01:24:00,880
Now if you remember in we
were soldiers once and young,

1400
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,550
there was the loss platoon which
was led by Henry t Herrick,

1401
01:24:06,551 --> 01:24:10,210
Lieutenant Henry, t Herrick, and
this guy was known to be aggressive,

1402
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:14,800
aggressive to the point of being
reckless, right? Overly aggressive.

1403
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:20,200
And his sergeant major, and this
is, this is from the book here,

1404
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,890
Sergeant Major Plumley told him, colonel,
if you put lieutenant Herrick in there,

1405
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,430
he will get all of them killed.
His senior enlisted man,

1406
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,690
his sergeant major told him, Hey,
don't put this guy in charge.

1407
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:35,710
He put them in charge anyways.
And he regretted that.

1408
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:37,020
Okay.

1409
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:42,020
And he said that that was one of his
leadership let downs that he failed to

1410
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:46,020
remove a toxic leader from the
ranks and Ann heric soldiers.

1411
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:50,040
Ultimately we're the ones that that paid
the price and therefore he says when

1412
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:53,220
you identify a toxic subordinate leader,
remove them.

1413
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,010
If you cannot remove them,

1414
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:59,400
reassign them to a role where
their toxicity can be minimized.

1415
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:02,523
Okay,

1416
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:06,750
so and I mean Herrick [inaudible] those
are, and again you have to get the book,

1417
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:08,730
we were soldiers once and young so you'd
get the whole story because I didn't

1418
01:25:08,731 --> 01:25:13,140
cover it in enough detail because it's
one thing that's going on in that,

1419
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:18,090
in that whole scenario and
inherit kind of redeemed himself,

1420
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:23,091
getting the guys together to at least
defend themselves for days out in the

1421
01:25:23,101 --> 01:25:27,600
field being attacked like
over and over and over again.

1422
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:33,750
But it was his hyper aggressiveness that
got them in that situation in the first

1423
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:37,020
place.
This is an interesting one.

1424
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:41,070
He's talking about his troops and he
says their duty at their level is just as

1425
01:25:41,071 --> 01:25:43,590
important as my duty at my level.

1426
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:45,310
Yeah,

1427
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:48,550
that's, that's awesome. And
I've talked about this before,

1428
01:25:48,551 --> 01:25:51,580
how I always wanted like every guy in
my platoon to think that they were the

1429
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:55,000
most important person in the platoon. And
that's what he's saying. And it's right.

1430
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:58,790
It's not just like, I was
like manipulating. It's like,
no, you're the radio man.

1431
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,770
Hmm. If we need help, you're the only
person that's gonna get us out. Yeah.

1432
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,720
But the corpsman,
if one of our guys gets wounded,

1433
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:05,960
you're the only person that's
gonna be all to save him.

1434
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:10,250
You're the machine gunner. You're the
most important job in the platoon. Yeah.

1435
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:14,250
Without you Blaine down cover fire, we
can't move. Yeah. It's like everyone,

1436
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,210
everyone's the most important.
Everyone's job is important

1437
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,520
now.
He,

1438
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:24,920
yeah,

1439
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,070
he's actually a critical and,

1440
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,570
and I got some feedback with, with w on,

1441
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,520
we were soldiers once and
young, you know, hair.

1442
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:37,940
Here's a guy that led his troops into
the situation in a bunch of guys died.

1443
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:41,930
And how has that in any way heroic.
And that's valid, right? I mean,

1444
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:46,820
a valid point. We don't. Now the counter
to that is, look, you don't know.

1445
01:26:46,821 --> 01:26:47,840
You're going to get
ambushed if you get it.

1446
01:26:47,841 --> 01:26:50,840
If you know you're going to get
ambushed like that against, you know,

1447
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:55,600
1500 soldiers, Vietnamese soldiers,
then you would make different decisions.

1448
01:26:55,601 --> 01:26:58,110
But we don't know that. We don't know
that we don't have a crystal ball. Yeah,

1449
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:04,360
but here's some of how his criticism of
the way the Vietnam war was fighting.

1450
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:07,760
Again,
this is similar to Hackworth.

1451
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,600
Hackworth eventually stood up and
said this out loud during the war,

1452
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:16,601
which is why he got so much criticism
from the army and also one of the reasons

1453
01:27:17,061 --> 01:27:22,061
why I like Hackworth so much is because
he did what I was talking about earlier.

1454
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:25,770
He was like, no, I don't believe in
doing this and we're, we're, we're,

1455
01:27:25,771 --> 01:27:28,130
we're not going to win this way.
He said that,

1456
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:30,060
okay,

1457
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:30,893
here's what,

1458
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:35,940
how more says from 1964 and to the
American withdrawal in 1973 our objectives

1459
01:27:35,941 --> 01:27:40,470
kept changing from political stability
and preventing an enemy takeover to

1460
01:27:40,471 --> 01:27:44,850
preserving the independence of south
Vietnam and training the Arvin forces.

1461
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:46,410
At first,

1462
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:51,710
the u s pushed the South Vietnamese
army aside and took the war over with a

1463
01:27:52,261 --> 01:27:56,280
brand of fighting that only
American forces and American
logistics could support.

1464
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,660
When we left in 1973 our
heritage was just that,

1465
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:05,580
a form of war that the South Vietnamese
and its armed forces could not sustain.

1466
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:10,770
In the late 1970s the army
chief of military history,

1467
01:28:10,771 --> 01:28:14,370
General Douglas Canard,
wrote a book called the war managers.

1468
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:15,750
Okay.

1469
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:20,340
He sent a questionnaire to 175 army
generals who had served in Vietnam.

1470
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,220
His book is the analysis of their replies.

1471
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Nearly 70% of those generals were
uncertain and unclear as to what the U s

1472
01:28:30,961 --> 01:28:34,260
objective was in Vietnam.
Damn,

1473
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:38,190
that's horrible.
That's absolutely horrible.

1474
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,070
Hundred and 75 generals.

1475
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:42,290
Okay.

1476
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:46,700
And 70% of them didn't know
what the objective was.

1477
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,960
Now, if you got the genitals, you
take that down a step to the kernels,

1478
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:54,560
to the battalion commanders,
to the company commanders,
to the platoon commanders,

1479
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:55,760
to the squad leaders.

1480
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:59,480
You get down to the front lines and guys
have no idea what they're doing there.

1481
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:03,750
How do we expect to accomplish the mission
when no one in the chain of command

1482
01:29:03,751 --> 01:29:06,950
really understands what it is that the
objective is, what the mission is? Hmm.

1483
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,013
Okay.

1484
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,430
So
with that,

1485
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:19,300
Colonel Moore says, a leader must
have clearly defined objectives.

1486
01:29:19,301 --> 01:29:23,260
He must ensure that these objectives are
clearly understood by his subordinate

1487
01:29:23,261 --> 01:29:26,020
leaders.
Lesson learned.

1488
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:32,913
Yeah.

1489
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:39,700
Here's a,
speaking of family life,

1490
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:43,630
there are at least five activities that
must be kept in balance through proper

1491
01:29:43,631 --> 01:29:47,620
time management. These five activities
are the job, physical fitness,

1492
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:51,880
personal time alone,
recreation and social relationships.

1493
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:56,290
Also if they apply to others,
religion and family.

1494
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:59,830
If any of these get out of balanced
in life gets out of balance.

1495
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:04,300
From my own personal experience
and observation of others,

1496
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:07,930
being a workaholic is the most
common area of imbalance. And again,

1497
01:30:07,931 --> 01:30:12,040
that's what I saw a lot with with with
the guys. I used to work with the,

1498
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,620
they are workaholics and not only that,
you know,

1499
01:30:14,621 --> 01:30:18,040
you meet business guys all the
time, you're not, you're not.

1500
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:23,290
There's so many business guys
that are workaholics, businessmen,

1501
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:25,240
business women that are out there.
They're grinding,

1502
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:30,240
they love it and they don't want
to stop. And that's again, that's,

1503
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:34,690
that's problematic. It's not, it's not
the most common, but business leaders,

1504
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,290
why are they in a leadership position?
Because they built something.

1505
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,160
Why did they build something?

1506
01:30:39,161 --> 01:30:41,290
Cause they wanted to win because
they wanted to take over.

1507
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:44,950
Well that doesn't just stop at a certain
point. It keeps going. It keeps growing.

1508
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,530
You reach one goal and you've
set another one, a higher one.

1509
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:49,630
That's the harder one that keeps going.

1510
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:53,950
That'd be careful of that one balance.

1511
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,720
After Vietnam he went and took over
a base where they were running basic

1512
01:31:01,721 --> 01:31:03,790
training and here's what he
said about basic training.

1513
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:07,420
The goal was for every man leaving
basic combat training to be in the best

1514
01:31:07,421 --> 01:31:09,190
physical shape of his life and to know it,

1515
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:13,450
to stretch his mind and his muscles and
to assist him and thereby gaining more

1516
01:31:13,451 --> 01:31:17,710
pride in himself, more self confidence
and above all more self disciplined.

1517
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,770
A man who has more self discipline,

1518
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:23,560
has more confidence in
his ability to do the job.

1519
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,870
I got asked a while back and we answered
it on the podcast, but you know,

1520
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:29,620
guy said, hey, I took over a
unit. They're kind of downtrodden.

1521
01:31:29,621 --> 01:31:33,730
What do I do to get their, their pride
back up? It's like, yeah, work them hard.

1522
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,550
Do hard training.
That's what you do.

1523
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,093
Discipline.

1524
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:40,700
Okay.

1525
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,680
Hard training.
Give them something to brag about.

1526
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:44,060
Give them something to take pride in.

1527
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,100
Yeah,

1528
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:52,100
he was dealing with Vietnam protestors
when he was running that base and he just

1529
01:31:54,031 --> 01:31:57,360
said, guys don't even show
your weapon known. Don't even,

1530
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:00,280
we're going to completely underreact
not going to give them what they want.

1531
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:01,930
And that's the one who is tenants here.

1532
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:05,290
Don't overreact and never
overreact to an overreaction.

1533
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:12,760
And I'm going to close this out
with a pretty big chunk here,

1534
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:17,440
but this is when how more
got back from Vietnam.

1535
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,800
He wrote a little piece called
Lieutenant leadership in combat.

1536
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:26,320
Okay.

1537
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,210
And here's what he says.

1538
01:32:27,211 --> 01:32:31,830
This is a compilation of a few of my
views on leadership of and by lieutenants,

1539
01:32:32,190 --> 01:32:35,220
specifically infantry platoon
leaders in a combat zone.

1540
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:39,840
It will be somewhat mixed in perspective
and is not possible in these few words

1541
01:32:39,841 --> 01:32:43,200
to get across my full views on leadership.
In my judgment,

1542
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:44,760
a leader builds over time,

1543
01:32:44,761 --> 01:32:49,440
his own unique brand of empathy or lack
of it with his subordinates and creates

1544
01:32:49,441 --> 01:32:53,820
his own leadership, debits and
credits with those under his orders.

1545
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:56,850
So you've heard me talk about
leadership capital, same thing.

1546
01:32:56,851 --> 01:33:01,380
He's talking about their leadership,
debits and credits. He does not.

1547
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:06,150
He does. He does this through personal
contact and shared experience based on the

1548
01:33:06,151 --> 01:33:08,310
interplay between leader and lead.

1549
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:13,380
Working with mixed perspectives shaped
by the dynamics of real time and real

1550
01:33:13,381 --> 01:33:14,214
life.

1551
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,390
Leadership is a highly
personal individual matter.

1552
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:23,490
Each leader must establish
his own approach based on
an internal compass using a

1553
01:33:23,491 --> 01:33:26,430
method geared to his personality,
his capabilities,

1554
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:30,390
but always oriented toward accomplishing
the mission while knowing and taking

1555
01:33:30,391 --> 01:33:32,850
care of his men. Now, while he says that,

1556
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:34,370
yeah,

1557
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:37,250
you got to come up with your own,
your own method of leadership.

1558
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:40,190
They're the fundamental principles that
he talks about that we talk about all

1559
01:33:40,191 --> 01:33:43,550
the time that we wrote about.
Those don't change.

1560
01:33:43,551 --> 01:33:48,080
You got to find your methodology of
presenting them and carrying yourself.

1561
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:51,200
But the fundamental
principles are fundamental.

1562
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,153
Hmm.

1563
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,560
As officers,

1564
01:33:55,561 --> 01:34:00,561
we are given groups of men to lead
other officers and Ncos and enlisted

1565
01:34:01,051 --> 01:34:05,430
soldiers. Each has a different
background, different problems,

1566
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:08,250
a different outlook and different duties.

1567
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:12,960
But no matter what their background
or their previous experience,

1568
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:14,400
no matter how much love,

1569
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:18,540
care and effort may have been spent over
the years by their parents and raising

1570
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:21,240
them when they are turned over to us,

1571
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,500
are now ours.

1572
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:28,580
Take care for at that instant the parents,

1573
01:34:28,581 --> 01:34:32,270
teachers or system that brought them
to that point, we'll be in the past.

1574
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:37,680
Their lives and future
are largely in our hands.

1575
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:43,200
This is a terrible responsibility
for a fire team leader to have,

1576
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:47,460
not to speak of a battalion,
a division or a corps commander.

1577
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:55,440
You got all these different people
coming in and you're responsible for now,

1578
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:56,341
and I'll tell you,

1579
01:34:56,341 --> 01:34:59,630
I've had this conversation with business
leaders to business leaders are the

1580
01:34:59,631 --> 01:35:02,840
same way because when you're
paying someone's paycheck,

1581
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:05,450
they're feeding their family, their
pay, they're paying their mortgage,

1582
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:08,630
they're saving for their kids to go to
school. They're paying their car payment.

1583
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,030
That's their life.

1584
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:16,130
And if you as a leader are
not helping them to achieve,

1585
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:17,930
you're letting them down.

1586
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,430
Okay.

1587
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:23,610
Now is it the exact same thing as having
their actual life or death in their

1588
01:35:23,611 --> 01:35:26,850
hand? No, it's not the same thing,
but the pressure is there. Yeah.

1589
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:29,870
Okay.

1590
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:31,610
Among other attributes.

1591
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:33,550
Yeah.

1592
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:38,260
I feel soldiers of any rank must
have confidence in four directions.

1593
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:43,510
The first is to have self confidence
developing. It leverages many resources,

1594
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:44,770
the primary sources,

1595
01:35:44,771 --> 01:35:48,730
expert knowledge of his assigned duties
and readiness at any time to take on the

1596
01:35:48,731 --> 01:35:49,840
next higher job.

1597
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:53,930
So you don't 100 people just
trained to do their job.

1598
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,200
You want them to be able to step up and
do the next job above them and the chain

1599
01:35:57,201 --> 01:36:00,590
of command. In addition to creating
confidence through individual expertise,

1600
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:05,210
his superiors, facilitators, development
through trust in how they treat them.

1601
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:10,700
This is imperative. Every person's
dignity must always be respected.

1602
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:15,830
I feel that if anyone under me fails,
the fault is at least half mine.

1603
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:19,820
A man should never be caused
to think poorly of himself.

1604
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,210
And this requires a subtle and
sensitive touch by the leader,

1605
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:25,580
especially when taking
disciplinary action.

1606
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,010
So the first thing he wants you
to have his self confidence,

1607
01:36:33,011 --> 01:36:35,050
right and you develop it
by how you treat them.

1608
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:41,770
Second but non priority or
in not in priority order is
the necessity for each to

1609
01:36:41,771 --> 01:36:46,120
have complete confidence in his personal
weapon as well as any other weapon he

1610
01:36:46,121 --> 01:36:51,121
might have to handle to include using
radios and the knowing procedures and

1611
01:36:51,461 --> 01:36:55,630
knowing the procedures for requesting and
controlling mortar and artillery fires

1612
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,030
developing. This takes leader
controlled leader supervised training,

1613
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:05,350
so you want to be good at your job,
you want to be expert in your job,

1614
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:08,350
the the,
the more expert you are in your job,

1615
01:37:08,351 --> 01:37:09,610
the more confident you're going to have.

1616
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:15,160
The third confidence in the unit
and the men who are fighting.

1617
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:20,250
The third is confidence in the unit and
the men who are fighting with him at

1618
01:37:21,011 --> 01:37:24,040
whatever level. The leader must
strive to develop an intense,

1619
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:27,580
a spree decor but never by
running down other units.

1620
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:33,550
An example of what not to do is to permit
internal sub units to be so disloyal

1621
01:37:33,551 --> 01:37:36,910
to the organization as a whole
as to critique, criticize,

1622
01:37:36,911 --> 01:37:41,911
snipe or run down sister units beat
a squad platoon or company on up.

1623
01:37:43,110 --> 01:37:46,690
It is self defeating and terrors.
The unit as a whole.

1624
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:48,760
It tears down the unit as a whole,
so

1625
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:53,030
you want them to have esprit de corps,

1626
01:37:53,031 --> 01:37:54,940
but you don't want them
to get it by cutting it.

1627
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,570
Other units that are within your team.

1628
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:04,410
Fourth and so vital. A man must have
confidence and trust in his leaders.

1629
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:10,720
He must know an utterly believe
his leaders are competent
professionals who know

1630
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:14,880
what they are doing and are not
careless or casual in their outlook.

1631
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:17,030
Look toward their responsibilities.

1632
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,920
For a subordinate to be confident in
his leader, the subordinate must know,

1633
01:38:21,921 --> 01:38:26,921
the leader is aware of and appreciates
what the subordinate must face and the

1634
01:38:27,051 --> 01:38:29,270
life he must lead in performing his job.

1635
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:36,330
The leader must make every effort to
get inside the heads of his men and see

1636
01:38:36,491 --> 01:38:39,070
their problems and the
world from their viewpoint.

1637
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,320
Got To get the perspective of your people.

1638
01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:46,930
You got to understand what they're going
through. You know, he talked about,

1639
01:38:46,931 --> 01:38:50,770
and we were soldiers once
and young that in the,

1640
01:38:50,771 --> 01:38:52,780
in the civil war that the officers,

1641
01:38:52,781 --> 01:38:55,840
it was like bad if you can ride your
horse all the time because then you didn't

1642
01:38:55,841 --> 01:38:57,070
understand the guys
who were marching with,

1643
01:38:57,071 --> 01:38:59,340
they're going through and in Vietnam
some guys were riding the helicopter,

1644
01:38:59,350 --> 01:38:59,551
all of this,

1645
01:38:59,551 --> 01:39:04,390
some commanders would stay
over the battlefield at 2000
feet out of a small arms

1646
01:39:04,391 --> 01:39:06,550
range. We're safe up
here. Nothing can happen.

1647
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:09,190
But you forget what those guys are
going through down there on the ground.

1648
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:13,960
Yeah. The gyms and Jujitsu.

1649
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:18,160
I'm the instructor gems em up
sometimes when you know, when you free,

1650
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:20,350
you're trying to teach someone something,
and I said this before,

1651
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:24,070
he called the curse of knowledge where
you don't, oh yeah, you're so advanced.

1652
01:39:24,071 --> 01:39:28,120
You forgot what the white belt is going
through in his learning, you know,

1653
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:31,330
so he started teaching stuff and you know,
they,

1654
01:39:31,331 --> 01:39:36,130
you forget that they need to know this
stuff first before they can pick up this

1655
01:39:36,131 --> 01:39:39,280
other stuff. You know, you need
perspective. Their perspective.

1656
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:41,790
Yeah.
Back to the book.

1657
01:39:41,791 --> 01:39:45,330
This takes some doing and while the
leader cannot be intrusive into personal

1658
01:39:45,331 --> 01:39:49,290
affairs, he must help solve
personal problems if he can,

1659
01:39:49,291 --> 01:39:53,550
especially if the problem's penalize
individual or unit performance.

1660
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:58,650
For example, in garrison and to
some extent, even in a combat area,

1661
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:03,060
most disciplinary problems
stem from women, alcohol,

1662
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:08,040
firearms, control, money
and vehicles. This is,

1663
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:13,260
this is from my old job. This is 100%
true. Women, Alcohol, firearms control,

1664
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:17,850
not so much money in vehicles for sure.
Yeah, guys crashing cars, guys, Duis,

1665
01:40:17,851 --> 01:40:21,390
guys crashing motorcycles.
Guys getting in trouble with girls.

1666
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:25,440
Drinking age is encompassed in all those.

1667
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:27,990
Knowing this,

1668
01:40:27,991 --> 01:40:32,991
a leader can perform a lot of preventative
maintenance as an isolated but not

1669
01:40:33,181 --> 01:40:34,110
sole example.

1670
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:38,520
Pay problems often arise for separated
families living on limited income.

1671
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:43,290
Many of these can be eliminated
in advance by real leadership.

1672
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:49,440
In summary,
my views are take care of the troops,

1673
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:53,010
develop four way confidence
and be professional.

1674
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:54,420
Okay.

1675
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:59,190
This ensures we can carry out our first
duty accomplishment of the mission.

1676
01:41:00,450 --> 01:41:03,060
Finally,
concerning professionalism.

1677
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:04,450
Okay.

1678
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:09,450
I believe even now the clock is
bringing us closer to some few seconds,

1679
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,310
minutes or hours.

1680
01:41:12,311 --> 01:41:17,080
In the future when the professionalism
we will have or will not have.

1681
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:18,360
Okay.

1682
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:23,360
We'll make a life or death difference
for the men placed under our leadership

1683
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:29,220
and whose families can
only trust hope and pray

1684
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:32,530
that we know our business.

1685
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:41,730
Yeah,
and again,

1686
01:41:41,731 --> 01:41:44,550
there's more than that book,

1687
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:51,950
but I think we'll close it out there
because what a thing to keep in your mind.

1688
01:41:55,820 --> 01:42:00,150
Just keep that in your mind that even
now the clock is bringing us closer,

1689
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:05,640
closer to a moment when your

1690
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,080
okay.

1691
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,490
Leadership will be tested

1692
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:15,180
and it is your professionalism
and that means your ability,

1693
01:42:15,181 --> 01:42:19,530
your mental and physical strength,
your knowledge, your judgement,

1694
01:42:19,531 --> 01:42:23,760
it will all be tested at some point.

1695
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:32,220
Have we done enough to
prepare for that moment?

1696
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:36,900
Have we trained hard enough?
Have we studied hard enough?

1697
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:40,410
Have we read enough?
Have we learned enough?

1698
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,730
Are we prepared?

1699
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:47,070
Okay

1700
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,030
for what is coming?

1701
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:57,220
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

1702
01:42:57,441 --> 01:43:01,880
So Echo, speaking of being prepared. Sure.

1703
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:06,620
Maybe you can give us some advice on
getting a little more prepared. Sure.

1704
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:10,310
Be Glad to
prepared for,

1705
01:43:10,311 --> 01:43:14,990
I'll start with k preparation for Jujitsu,
few through references,

1706
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:18,230
usually through his life.
Grappling is like,

1707
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,780
do you do to this life and
youth are these life by the way,

1708
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:25,130
there's a lot of similarities, I would
say Nesians age you did to his life.

1709
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:28,370
Well if you say that then that's cool.
The metaphor. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1710
01:43:28,371 --> 01:43:32,690
But for some people Jujitsu to life,
yes. They're just training. Yeah. Good.

1711
01:43:32,691 --> 01:43:36,940
Good for them. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. It
shouldn't be your whole life. Yeah.

1712
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:39,500
Some other things. Yeah. I didn't
mean it that way. I meant it.

1713
01:43:39,501 --> 01:43:43,790
Like Jitsu reflects life. It's
like a metaphor for life. Yes.

1714
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:47,150
In the event,
have you been in Jujitsu?

1715
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:50,480
Like many people are and
more people are becoming,

1716
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:56,540
a lot of people ask me what Geeta
get. I know. Yup. I'm going into it.

1717
01:43:56,541 --> 01:44:00,860
You get an origin g, that's
how many do you have?

1718
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:05,450
Four. Four, okay. I have three. Okay.

1719
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,220
Every single one of them is outstanding.
Yeah.

1720
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:14,450
Designed outstanding.
Designed,

1721
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:19,451
designed here though here in American
America and the recent Jujitsu players,

1722
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:25,760
by the way. Yeah. Jujitsu players. So
I was, I watched, um, one of their,

1723
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:28,820
one of Pete's videos and it was,

1724
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:32,660
if you go to their youtube channels, you
know, the, how you have the main video.

1725
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:35,480
Yup. It's watching that and
it made sense, you know,

1726
01:44:35,481 --> 01:44:38,960
you'd see everyone that's
part of the factory,

1727
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:43,040
they kind of give their input in the
video a little bit and it made sense.

1728
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:46,760
So like, you know, like there's a
lot of geese that are made, you know,

1729
01:44:46,761 --> 01:44:50,120
kind of thing. But if it's made by
Jujitsu people, they're going to know,

1730
01:44:50,121 --> 01:44:52,040
like when you put on a ski jacket,

1731
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:55,070
they're going to know the
difference between a g.

1732
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:59,840
That's that whoever designed it had this
in mind. When you put your hands up,

1733
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:03,290
what's that Geek gonna do you
know, if you're just, Oh, I'm just,

1734
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:06,790
I'm going to make a geek.
And they don't necessarily do Jujitsu,

1735
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:11,720
they might not pay, pay attention and
that kind of stuff. Or, um, you know,

1736
01:45:11,721 --> 01:45:14,270
when you did, you did, let's
face it, like if you do karate,

1737
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:17,360
your body goes through a certain thing,
right?

1738
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:21,200
While you're doing karate in
whatever capacity. If you do Jujitsu,

1739
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:24,920
your body is going to go through a certain
thing and more appropriately your g

1740
01:45:24,921 --> 01:45:28,190
is going to go through a
certain experience and you
can't use a karate d for

1741
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:30,890
this. You Shits. That's one
of the things I'm saying.

1742
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:35,891
So let's say the way you put on and keep
on a karate GI or a Jujitsu g is going

1743
01:45:37,851 --> 01:45:42,851
to be going to play a role
in when you do Jujitsu.

1744
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:46,370
So like you tie, you know when you
tie your pants or something like this,

1745
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:53,470
how your pants are tied
matters when you do Jujitsu.

1746
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:58,250
True. Just like how you belt it in
your belt is tight. It matters anyway,

1747
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:00,830
Pete and these an origin,

1748
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:03,650
they kept that in mind when they
designed it and it shows too, by the way.

1749
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,233
So anyway,

1750
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:10,690
these are some of the reasons that you
should 100% get an origin g if you're

1751
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:15,470
still wondering what key to
get more important in that.

1752
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:19,850
If you don't do Jujitsu and that's
why you don't need to start Jujitsu.

1753
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,530
Yeah.
Then you'll need again,

1754
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:26,180
you'll need to get you started
Jujitsu and this was done.

1755
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:31,310
The parallels between you two to in life
and you'll get in good shape and you'll,

1756
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:34,190
you'll learn to defend yourself.
Real situations,

1757
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:37,700
recalibrate your instincts,
recalibrate your instincts,

1758
01:46:37,701 --> 01:46:41,720
which are completely wrong.
By the way, there are wrong.
Yes. If you are right now,

1759
01:46:41,721 --> 01:46:44,180
if you're listening and you're thinking,
you know, my instincts aren't that bad.

1760
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:45,300
No,
I'm telling you that long.

1761
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:48,680
If you don't think they're
wrong [inaudible] academy
and tell him you got good

1762
01:46:48,681 --> 01:46:52,860
instincts. Let's roll.
Yeah. Here's one in life.

1763
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:57,920
Do you want to turn your back
to your problems in life?
No. You do not in Jujitsu.

1764
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:00,510
Do you want to turn your back
to your no, you do not. Okay.

1765
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:05,310
But your instinct might tell you
in a fight and sometimes in life,

1766
01:47:06,370 --> 01:47:09,540
cause that's what we do sometimes. See
that's where, that's why, how more more,

1767
01:47:09,541 --> 01:47:12,270
sorry. We're not listening to our
instincts all the time. Not all the time.

1768
01:47:12,271 --> 01:47:16,020
Not all the time, but
we don't follow them.

1769
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,250
You can listen to it and that's
a caution. Right? But no, no, no.

1770
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:23,370
He's saying if they're predicated on your
education experience, learning, reading,

1771
01:47:23,371 --> 01:47:24,480
reading,
right.

1772
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:29,480
So essentially you are going to listen
to your recalibrated instincts after you

1773
01:47:29,771 --> 01:47:32,850
train in Jujitsu with your origin Geek.
Cause that's when you can get,

1774
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:36,510
because that's the best one. Straight
up. That might sound like an opinion,

1775
01:47:36,511 --> 01:47:41,250
but it's a straight up fact.
You get these keys@originmain.com.

1776
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:46,710
They have some other stuff on
there, some apparel, rash guards,

1777
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:50,130
compression gear.
That being said,

1778
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:52,620
there's also other stuff.

1779
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:57,210
Supplemental stone supplements.
Okay, so Krill oil, uh, you know,

1780
01:47:57,211 --> 01:48:01,290
he's talking about the supplements that
I think Jocko thinks I'm being for you

1781
01:48:01,291 --> 01:48:04,200
right now. What a good
supplements. Krill oil,

1782
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:10,710
joint warfare. These are things
to maintain your structure,

1783
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:14,130
bodily structure that to scientific Sony.
No,

1784
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,850
I don't think you have the
capability of sending to scientifics

1785
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:22,400
and grill. I think you
might be right. Nonetheless.

1786
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:24,080
That was one of those digs
I was talking about earlier.

1787
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:27,450
Like I don't mean it in a bad way, but it
kinda come across like I'm a jerk. Yeah.

1788
01:48:27,451 --> 01:48:31,110
What do you think? I'm stupid. I'm stupid.
Things don't sound real scientific.

1789
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:36,210
Should I just not talk anymore? Some
people would support that answer that.

1790
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:41,890
Anyway. Supplements? Yes. Jack has an
echo lovers and there's echo haters. Okay.

1791
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:45,810
They're both, there's two camps.
The ecolodge is a bigger camp.

1792
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:50,640
Hopefully the echo haters
is a louder camp. Yeah,

1793
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:55,290
and it makes sense.
The grapes,

1794
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:59,550
I think they come up the
chain or down the chain.

1795
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:05,250
Both. Yeah. Man, it makes sense to
me. If you're honest, you're honest.

1796
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:08,400
There it is. Nonetheless, back to
supplements. Chocolate, the supplements,

1797
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:10,890
they're good. Supplements,
supplements. Chocolate actually takes,

1798
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:16,050
see that's a big deal. Do what I
say, not what I do in this case.

1799
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:20,610
Look disciplining me right now. You're
doing all kinds of bringing stuff back.

1800
01:49:20,611 --> 01:49:23,940
Closing the loop on the podcast.
I'm just trying to learn these things.

1801
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:28,170
Apply them to my life and in
this particular situation,

1802
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:33,470
life is telling the people about
joint warfare and Super Krill oil.

1803
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:38,010
Anyway. It's a Omega threes
in the Krill oil. Obviously.

1804
01:49:38,011 --> 01:49:40,020
If he didn't know about Krill oil,
I think that

1805
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:45,390
Krill oil ended up to be one of
those. Sleeper, what do you call them?

1806
01:49:45,550 --> 01:49:47,990
Sleeper supplements.
You know where you like it.

1807
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,490
It's been going on the whole time
but you didn't know about it.

1808
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:53,860
You didn't know about it. I'm
not about it, Kevin. That's me.

1809
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:56,320
Nonetheless Jocko has it takes it.

1810
01:49:56,350 --> 01:50:00,880
I take it and I will
say 100% effectiveness.

1811
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:05,470
My opinion or do you mean scientific
opinion? The scientific, yeah, big time.

1812
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:10,060
Double blind tripled or demean.com
that's where you get it.

1813
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:14,860
Also for a pre mission supplement.

1814
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:17,860
New Supplement Chocos supplements.

1815
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:22,870
It's called disciplines like a
preworkout cognitive enhancer.

1816
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:26,110
Is that accurate?
You could call it that.

1817
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:31,840
It's pre life life. You have
Michigan cause what's your mission?

1818
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:35,930
Because I just don't need
cognitive enhancement when I,

1819
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,780
when I'm going to get in the game.
Sure.

1820
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:42,550
I also need to have physical
force multiplication. Yeah.

1821
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:45,010
So that's why we made it.
Yeah.

1822
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:48,730
Cause I wanted cause cause when I
do stuff it's physical and mental.

1823
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:52,870
It's physical and mental. You need
to be, both of those need to be

1824
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:55,353
tuned up.

1825
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,560
Yet some fire did so enhanced if you will.

1826
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,910
At the very least it should
be squared away. Yeah.

1827
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:06,340
Well and the good thing you can feel it.
Yeah,

1828
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:10,570
see and that works real good for Jujitsu
cause Jesus is one of those things.

1829
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,910
Let's face it,
if I'm doing a bench press,

1830
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:15,610
you know people have asked me all the
time like who did you take a pre workout

1831
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:17,980
in the morning? Cause I get up early
in the morning going to work out.

1832
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:21,310
I do not take a pre workout in the
morning before I go and work out in the

1833
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:24,010
morning. No. Oh yeah. You don't want to
talk discipline? No I don't drink driving.

1834
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:26,440
I go in there, I drink water, I
brushed my teeth and drink walker.

1835
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,290
Then I go on and do my morning workout.

1836
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:35,130
So I do not take a pre workout or a
nootropic prior to working out in the

1837
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:36,850
morning.
However,

1838
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:40,990
for the Shark Shitzu there is a,

1839
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:45,660
I would say I'm about 60
or 70% of the time I'm on,

1840
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:50,780
on the discipline when I go in there
because you can feel it like it.

1841
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:54,640
You can feel better. Like why
not have good training. Yeah.

1842
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:59,670
And that is one of those things like life
is one of those things where this kind

1843
01:52:00,221 --> 01:52:05,221
of supplement makes 100% sense because
it is physical and mental and not just

1844
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:09,370
Ooh, you know, like everything's mental.
I get it. Yeah. Your brain dresser I get,

1845
01:52:09,371 --> 01:52:13,210
it's true. Even if you're doing,
you know, bench press or whatever,

1846
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:14,560
he's still mental for sure.

1847
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:19,620
But did you to like your mind
has to be going at the same pace.

1848
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:24,280
You're using your mind just as much if
not more during Jujitsu or you're using

1849
01:52:24,281 --> 01:52:27,310
your body by the way. I think if
you were going to do a little, okay,

1850
01:52:27,311 --> 01:52:31,840
so in the mornings I don't need
it. Yeah Bro. I don't need it.

1851
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:34,150
Like I don't,
in the morning I'm ready.

1852
01:52:34,210 --> 01:52:39,130
Like I wake up and I'm like
ready to rock and roll. I don't,

1853
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,990
I'm, I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get it. Get it. Yeah.

1854
01:52:42,730 --> 01:52:45,890
I will say this during a
over the Christmas time,

1855
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,700
some of my workouts in the morning because
I had other responsibilities during

1856
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:53,750
that time period cause you got early
morning tactical things that you're doing

1857
01:52:53,751 --> 01:52:55,100
around Christmas,
et Cetera.

1858
01:52:55,820 --> 01:53:00,350
And because he got kids and whatnot and
so some of my work and then in the APP

1859
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:01,640
when I was working on the afternoon,

1860
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:06,290
I was getting on the discipline in the
afternoon because it's not the morning

1861
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:10,320
time anymore. Them a little bit. So
you're like one guy who like, you know,

1862
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:13,500
certain people they have their,
they're like uh, what do you call it?

1863
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,490
Like time of day where they're
kind of peaks their potential.

1864
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:19,820
I think my performance actually peaks
in the afternoon. Like most people.

1865
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:23,720
I think that's the most common time.
But in the morning when I get up,

1866
01:53:23,721 --> 01:53:26,330
I'm ready to rock and roll
is what I'm saying. I don't,

1867
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:28,340
I just want to get in there
and get it done. Like I'm,

1868
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:31,010
I feel like I missed out a bunch
of stuff when I was sleeping.

1869
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:35,270
Like what just happened?
I kind of feel the opposite.

1870
01:53:35,271 --> 01:53:37,430
I feel like when I'm working on with
like, Dang, I could be sleeping.

1871
01:53:39,670 --> 01:53:44,210
You need the discipline. Nonetheless.
It's called discipline. The pre mission,

1872
01:53:44,211 --> 01:53:48,800
we call it a pre mission. Yes.
Supplement. Yes. It's good.

1873
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:52,730
It's a good good name or do you
mean.com that's where you get it.

1874
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:58,160
Also for kick ass fitness gear on
it.com/jocko I get the kettle bells.

1875
01:54:00,861 --> 01:54:03,620
I have the kettle bells. My collection
is girl. I'm going for all of them.

1876
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:08,970
That's my, that's my my my goal.
Clear and concise. Cool. You know,

1877
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:13,370
if you want a, if you want to make
your workout routine more interesting,

1878
01:54:13,371 --> 01:54:18,371
there's a lot of cool stuff on their
battle ropes maces and you can look up all

1879
01:54:18,381 --> 01:54:22,010
the workouts you want to do. I think
there's a big deal for people unlike you,

1880
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:26,330
by the way, who don't mind doing
the routine routine. Your team,

1881
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:30,320
you want to mix it up.
That's what I think anyway.

1882
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:33,920
Audit dotcom slash Jocko, the street.
You can get them awesome stuff.

1883
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:37,100
Also when you get the book,

1884
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:40,700
we were soldiers once and young and also

1885
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:49,910
how more on leadership winning
when outgunned and outmanned,

1886
01:54:50,910 --> 01:54:53,300
that's what it's called. When you're
getting these books. Don't worry.

1887
01:54:53,301 --> 01:54:58,130
I have the list of books including
this one by episode on the website,

1888
01:54:58,131 --> 01:55:00,170
Jocko,
podcast.com and while you're doing that,

1889
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:03,590
make a note to yourself that you need
to put the link to the new extreme

1890
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:06,680
ownership because somebody tweeted me
that you have the old extreme ownership

1891
01:55:06,681 --> 01:55:11,630
linkedin there, which is not good.
Are you guys selling the old one?

1892
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:15,350
I don't think you can get any
more if you can get it. Well, no,

1893
01:55:15,351 --> 01:55:18,080
I don't think I can get it more. Just
the new one. All right, get sold out.

1894
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:22,820
All right. There you go. Boom. Yet another
book on the list and that list is at,

1895
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:26,510

the top on the menu there. Click on books.

1896
01:55:26,511 --> 01:55:29,660
Boom. All the books, including the ones
that we, the one we went over today,

1897
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:34,310
extreme ownership. I'm gonna call
it the new one. What do you call,

1898
01:55:34,311 --> 01:55:37,190
what's the official? The new
one. The new one. That's it.

1899
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:45,270
The black one. The black one.
The black cover. Yeah. It's
got the black cover. Yeah,

1900
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:47,940
there it is. Anyway. Either way. Yeah,

1901
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:52,260
it's the new one has
excerpts from the podcast.

1902
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,760
When we talk about leadership on the
podcast, the really prominent questions,

1903
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:58,660
right?
Put some of those interviewed there.

1904
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:03,670
They're included in there and there's
also a new forward and there's new

1905
01:56:04,111 --> 01:56:07,820
pictures in their color pictures.
I ain't held the line.

1906
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:12,120
Tried to hold the line pictures.
Color pictures are cool man. For them.

1907
01:56:12,121 --> 01:56:13,740
It's a step up for me to step down.

1908
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:21,300
I don't mind the color pictures. I think
they're cool. Um, but yeah, there it is.

1909
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:24,810
Nonetheless. You can get it all odd
duck and stop. Come in the book section,

1910
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:27,990
Click on there.
It's a good way to support boom.

1911
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:32,640
Takes it to Amazon and do some shopping
on there with these books here or

1912

how also subscribe to the podcast,

1913

providing platforms. If you
haven't already, leave a review.

1915
01:56:45,601 --> 01:56:49,920
If you're in the mood, if
you're in the mood, if you're
compelled to leave, review.

1916
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:52,440
Also Youtube,
we have a youtube channel.

1917
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:56,370
I haven't read any podcast reviews
on the podcast in a long time,

1918
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,710
so maybe this,
there's some really good ones.

1919
01:57:00,510 --> 01:57:05,010
The funny ones. Yeah. There's some
funny ones that's like, I'm like, good.

1920
01:57:05,011 --> 01:57:09,210
Doesn't mean like, Hey, this
is the best podcast ever.
Good, right. You're just, yeah,

1921
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:13,500
something that's funny and creative and
it's still good. Yes, of course. Well,

1922
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,840
because in your way of saying good,

1923
01:57:15,841 --> 01:57:19,190
it can still be a negative review as
long as it's good. A good one. Yeah,

1924
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:22,280
sure what I'm saying. Yeah. I mean,
I don't recommend let me sleep,

1925
01:57:22,281 --> 01:57:27,281
but as far as your criteria for the
word good in this specific case.

1926
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:32,970
Good, good, good review. Good
entertaining. I should say entertaining,

1927
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:37,140
entertaining. They're just the
same with same with on Amazon. Yes.

1928
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:41,610
There's some entertaining reviews.
I've read some of those.

1929
01:57:41,611 --> 01:57:44,490
I'll read some more of those because
they're good people put time and effort

1930
01:57:44,491 --> 01:57:48,900
into those. Yeah, they do for sure
and their and their sense of Umer.

1931
01:57:49,170 --> 01:57:52,770
Yeah. I support that
too, by the way. Also,

1932
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:56,820
like I said, youtube screw, right. We
have a youtube channel, Jocko podcasts,

1933
01:57:56,821 --> 01:57:59,100
what it's called, it's what it's
called, youtube channel. Boom.

1934
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:02,730
I've got some extra ups on there if
you'd want to necessarily watch the whole

1935
01:58:02,731 --> 01:58:05,970
two, three hour podcasts, video format,

1936
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:08,940
some excerpts on there and it
takes specific lessons. Boom,

1937
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:13,310
all on the youtube channel. Most
of them, all of them, most of them.

1938
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:18,620
Nonetheless. I'm also a tiny
fraction of them actually. You know,

1939
01:58:18,930 --> 01:58:23,930
some of them will say also there are
deleted scenes every once in a while I'll

1940
01:58:24,241 --> 01:58:29,241
put some deleted scenes if you care or
are interested in what Jocko digs at me

1941
01:58:31,231 --> 01:58:36,231
about while we're not actually technically
we're recording but it's not part of

1942
01:58:36,571 --> 01:58:41,010
it. PODCASTS, prerecording free
recording if you're interested,

1943
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:44,020
that kind of stuff. It's on the youtube
every once in a while I'll post them.

1944
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:48,160
Also, Jack was a store,
it's called Jocko store.

1945
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:52,060
Obviously this is where you can get,
if you want the shirts,

1946
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:57,550
shirts, hoodies, maybe some hats
on their rash guards. Strangely,

1947
01:58:57,551 --> 01:59:00,130
a lot of people who've been hitting me
up for rash guards and I've been seeing

1948
01:59:00,131 --> 01:59:04,920
him out in the wild way more recently.
People are getting after it. Big Tim

1949
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:07,181
where he could rest.

1950
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:11,920
Guards are on there for the youth
youth sizes towards a lawyer.

1951
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:16,480
Kids. Yeah, exactly. Right. Boom.
They're up up shipping going out already.

1952
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:21,010
I'm also, we have a new one on there.
Just if you want any of this stuff.

1953
01:59:21,011 --> 01:59:23,830
This is where you can get them. Jocko,
store.com some good stuff, girl.

1954
01:59:23,831 --> 01:59:28,120
Stuff on the women's stuff on
there. Also, psychological warfare.

1955
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:32,080
If you didn't know what that is,
I know I've explained it before,

1956
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:34,540
but in the event of you not
hearing it yet, this is what it is.

1957
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:38,980
It's an album with tracks,
not songs.

1958
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:40,810
They're Jocko tracks.

1959
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:45,470
So basically what these structure
for are your in you file.

1960
01:59:45,660 --> 01:59:48,510
You're going to keep it
concise for a moment. Now.

1961
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:52,350
Well here's the thing I
think is important. If you
can do it in 10 seconds, no,

1962
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:54,010
I can't do it in Texas.
10 seconds.

1963
01:59:54,011 --> 01:59:58,090
I'm not going to do our people the
disservice of making it 10 seconds.

1964
01:59:58,890 --> 01:59:59,890
This,
this is,

1965
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,870
this product was made for me is my
product essentially true statement when it

1966
02:00:04,871 --> 02:00:07,270
comes down to it. So when you
come, okay, here's what it is.

1967
02:00:07,271 --> 02:00:11,150
When you come across your moment,
it's a weakness in life.

1968
02:00:13,050 --> 02:00:15,740
Okay? Sounded like you were
right there. Little bit

1969
02:00:17,490 --> 02:00:21,440
miss in life. Like you know
you're waking up early, right?

1970
02:00:21,441 --> 02:00:23,960
You want to keep it consistent all year,
New Year,

1971
02:00:23,961 --> 02:00:26,330
new me waking up early every single day.

1972
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:30,140
Maybe not on Sundays or maybe
Sundays too, I dunno. Whatever.

1973
02:00:30,141 --> 02:00:34,040
Either way when you wake up, sometimes
you're not going to feel like it.

1974
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:36,350
Sometimes you're going to
want to hit the snooze. Boom,

1975
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,820
put in one of these tracks.

1976
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:44,770
It's Jocko on there telling
you pragmatically giving
you practical advice on why

1977
02:00:46,701 --> 02:00:49,970
you shouldn't hit the snooze.
Same thing with skipping workouts.

1978
02:00:49,971 --> 02:00:51,920
Same thing with cheating on the Diet.

1979
02:00:53,690 --> 02:00:56,300
Do you call it cheating on the Diet?
I don't know what you call it.

1980
02:00:56,301 --> 02:01:00,470
I call it eating donuts. Eating
donuts, slipping out the Diet.

1981
02:01:00,860 --> 02:01:05,210
You know he didn't need speed bumps.
Weakness, speed bumps is what they are.

1982
02:01:05,970 --> 02:01:07,480
Yeah. Speed bumps. Some job.

1983
02:01:08,150 --> 02:01:13,150
I had some chocolate cake
with mint chocolate chip
ice cream on all of this and

1984
02:01:13,271 --> 02:01:17,320
it was good. How many times? More
than once. No, I, you know what?

1985
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:22,830
I had twice in the same
situation like boom,

1986
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:24,580
I'm back again.
Boom.

1987
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:29,500
Two hits and boom buddies like chocolate
cake with mint chocolate chip ice cream,

1988
02:01:29,501 --> 02:01:32,680
which is not normal, so that's
right, like kind of got me.

1989
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:36,280
I wasn't listening to the psychology
course or I see that's a perfect example

1990
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:40,840
where actually that's not a perfect
example because I'm sure you were kind of

1991
02:01:40,841 --> 02:01:44,520
like, hey, freedom. Yeah,
that was the freedom. You are
free. You are a discipline.

1992
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:49,340
You're exercising the freedom part. This
is for times where like you're at work.

1993
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:54,020
I'm actually fasting right now other
than having some Jocko white tea and some

1994
02:01:54,021 --> 02:01:57,600
discipline. I'm fasting. Yeah.
People. Some people are like,

1995
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:00,123
whatever.

1996
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:06,070
I had 27,000 calories a day
to eating four calories a day.

1997
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:10,490
Still not fasting. I
think zero. I don't know.

1998
02:02:10,491 --> 02:02:15,040
I'm not an expert either way.
What this is about. What a, um,

1999
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:18,410
psychological warfare, what, what you
were done. Who It's for? No, no, no, no.

2000
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:21,500
You are numb.
The whole explanation that had been done,

2001
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:26,600
we're still on not album
tracks. You sit. No.

2002
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:30,500
You said you use the example
of you eating chocolate

2003
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:35,540
with ice cream as one of the scenarios.

2004
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:40,520
The chocolate cake had like a
hard shell of chocolate on it.

2005
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:46,660
That is the reason I
asked how many times can,

2006
02:02:46,670 --> 02:02:49,290
was kind of melted a little bit.
That's how

2007
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:54,940
well you do it with like a Brownie, so
it melts. Actually it's kind of the same.

2008
02:02:55,930 --> 02:03:00,230
There's not a restaurant in
San Diego, ob, California,

2009
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:04,720
it's called Raglan. And they have
something there called the legal.

2010
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:08,080
Yeah. Because it's so good that
it should be leading. Right.

2011
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:12,620
And it is, it's a, it's
no big deal. Right.

2012
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:14,970
This is what makes it so
good is it's just the, uh,

2013
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:17,720
a little cast iron pan,

2014
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:22,960
just a little cast iron pan and they
cook a chocolate chip cookie it. Yeah.

2015
02:03:23,150 --> 02:03:27,350
And then they put vanilla ice cream on
that thing is, should it be illegal?

2016
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:30,830
Yeah. Yeah. That might be, you know what,

2017
02:03:30,831 --> 02:03:33,470
my psychological warfare
might not work against that.

2018
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:37,040
Even Ragland that's saying
watch out for that one.

2019
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:40,940
That's saying a lot because as of right
now, I think it's 100% success rate.

2020
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:44,570
Actually 101% so I heard,

2021
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:47,660
I heard out in the field reports,
but you were saying,

2022
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:54,530
you were saying that that's the
example when to use it. It's not,

2023
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:57,650
oh the example is when you're on the path,

2024
02:03:57,651 --> 02:04:01,070
but you feel like the moment of weakness.
I don't think the chocolate chip,

2025
02:04:01,130 --> 02:04:03,920
that was a conscious decision of,
yeah, you know, it's the holidays,

2026
02:04:03,921 --> 02:04:05,360
I'm going to do this,
you know, kind of thing.

2027
02:04:05,361 --> 02:04:07,880
I'm an extra in my freedom because
of one of my discipline. All that.

2028
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:11,600
It's like when you're at work, it's not
lunchtime yet. It's almost lunch time,

2029
02:04:11,601 --> 02:04:14,120
but not quite yet. Boom,
they got the donuts. Right.

2030
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:17,510
Cause there's some big office meeting
they want to cater, you know, whatever.

2031
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:20,320
It's that kind of situation because
you don't have that, so it's good dude.

2032
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:24,440
That's what's good fasting. Recalibrate
that, that little hunger vibe,

2033
02:04:24,710 --> 02:04:29,510
unless you hit a speed bump of
weakness during the fast yeah.

2034
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:33,470
Then you can by the way. Yeah. Oh
yeah, for sure. Like peanut butter,

2035
02:04:33,471 --> 02:04:34,490
like there had been fascinating.

2036
02:04:34,491 --> 02:04:36,830
The biggest thing that I think the biggest
thing someone was asking me about it

2037
02:04:36,831 --> 02:04:38,030
the other day.
Um,

2038
02:04:38,330 --> 02:04:41,400
well the, the reason he's like,
what's, what's the hardest part?

2039
02:04:41,401 --> 02:04:45,030
Like the first eight hours, the first 12
hours, the first 24 hours. And I was like,

2040
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:49,830
the hardest part of a fast is the parts
where you're not doing something. Yeah.

2041
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:52,890
Like I haven't thought about eating one
time during while we've been recording

2042
02:04:52,891 --> 02:04:54,390
this podcast.
I haven't thought about eating.

2043
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:59,130
One time when we get done and we
square ourselves away and you leave,

2044
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:03,680
I'm going to be like, cool, what
am I gonna do now? You know?

2045
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:07,290
But then if I was to go from here
and like drive to go do something,

2046
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,570
I wouldn't think about it. Are
you talking to the phone? Yeah.

2047
02:05:09,571 --> 02:05:14,160
You got something going on? How
long has this, I don't know.

2048
02:05:14,161 --> 02:05:16,500
I think I'm actually going to eat
this afternoon or this evening. Oh,

2049
02:05:16,501 --> 02:05:20,030
so you're like, Hey, I'm just going to
fast. What do you have a minimum amount?

2050
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:21,630
I know I'll do like 24 hours.

2051
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:26,660
You said do 24 hours once a month and
then I'll do 72 hours once a quarter.

2052
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:29,970
Yeah,
I'll have,

2053
02:05:30,450 --> 02:05:33,660
I'll have a few handfuls of mixed nuts.

2054
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:37,890
Like throughout the day I'll grab a
handful of mixed nuts. I'll have some tea,

2055
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:40,090
some Jocko white tea by the way.
Uh,

2056
02:05:40,210 --> 02:05:41,850
revisit the first one
where I've done discipline,

2057
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:45,180
which I think is really good
cause it's making me feel great.

2058
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:50,250
So and like there's no calories in it
orders one calorie or something really

2059
02:05:50,251 --> 02:05:54,390
small in there. Yeah. But yeah, and,

2060
02:05:54,391 --> 02:05:59,391
and recalibrates your hunger
sensitivities and man,

2061
02:05:59,551 --> 02:06:02,940
I feel good when I do it. So have
you done it? You have 24 hour fast.

2062
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:06,600
You feel good, right? You
feel good enough? Here's it.
Here's the thing. Wait, wait.

2063
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:10,420
24 hours. Yeah. I use 24.

2064
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:13,620
I actually probably do 24 hours more
than once a month because a lot of times

2065
02:06:13,621 --> 02:06:16,950
I'll just wake up, I'll be traveling
and I just won't eat. Yeah.

2066
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:20,160
And so I ate the night before. I wake
up early in the morning, I go, I travel,

2067
02:06:20,161 --> 02:06:21,690
I get somewhere at night
and then I eat dinner.

2068
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:23,760
Well that means I just went
24 hours without eating.

2069
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:28,800
And that's kind of essentially kind
of how it happened for me early on.

2070
02:06:28,801 --> 02:06:31,200
But after a while you're like, you
know the kind where you like, Dang,

2071
02:06:31,201 --> 02:06:33,450
I'm totally miss lunch,
but I don't want to eat.

2072
02:06:33,451 --> 02:06:36,210
No because I won't be hungry for
dinner with the family kind of thing.

2073
02:06:36,211 --> 02:06:38,450
So I'm like, Hey, I'm not going to eat.
Then I'm like, wait, hold on. Sorry.

2074
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:43,200
I just went 24 hours.
You know what I've noticed this time,

2075
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:45,150
and like I said,
it's only been 36 hours right now.

2076
02:06:45,151 --> 02:06:47,850
But what I've noticed
this time is the actual,

2077
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,190
I felt good about exercising discipline.

2078
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:54,290
Like I felt good about like I'm not
eating that because maybe it's because,

2079
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:57,750
because I just, I've been
thinking to myself and like, yeah,

2080
02:06:57,751 --> 02:06:59,520
I don't need to eat right
now and that feels good.

2081
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:03,070
I've been actually enjoying the
discipline of it, which is, uh,

2082
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:05,970
normally I don't enjoy the discipline
of it. Normally I haven't, none that,

2083
02:07:05,971 --> 02:07:08,880
I don't, I've never even thought about
it before this time I've been like, yes.

2084
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:12,840
Yeah, that makes sense. I'll shut
you down, man. I don't remember.

2085
02:07:12,841 --> 02:07:14,520
I know we don't talk
about seal training a lot,

2086
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:16,950
but when you go through hell week,

2087
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:19,530
which is like when you
stay awake for five days,

2088
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:22,050
one of the things that I thought about
when I was going through hell week was

2089
02:07:22,051 --> 02:07:24,330
like, oh, it's going to feel so good
to sleep when I get done with this,

2090
02:07:24,331 --> 02:07:28,140
that it kind of made me feel good
to do it. Like I was like, aw man,

2091
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:30,200
can you imagine how good it's going
to feel when I get done with this?

2092
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:33,960
I could go to sleep and it's going to
feel so good and right now I'm kinda like

2093
02:07:33,961 --> 02:07:35,030
the same thing. I'm kind of thinking, oh,

2094
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:39,160
this feels so good to not to not eat
right now because in two days I'm going to

2095
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:44,230
eat and it's going to be solid.
It's the same way. I feel strangely,

2096
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:44,891
not strangely,

2097
02:07:44,891 --> 02:07:49,060
but same way I feel when I go on vacation
or I'm like if I didn't do a lot,

2098
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:51,940
a lot of work for the, you know,
the past two months or whatever.

2099
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:53,410
Like let's say work is
like kind of cruise.

2100
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:55,870
We'll say like he didn't like test me.
You know how like

2101
02:07:58,060 --> 02:08:00,640
if I shoot all day,
like at the muster,

2102
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:03,930
I'm kind of shooting all day from four
30 [inaudible] everyone is talking about

2103
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:07,000
taking pictures and I'm like,
where are you shooting?

2104
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:10,900
I don't shoot guns for,
no, I do nonetheless.

2105
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:14,170
Will you do a few musters you make
some big, you know in my case,

2106
02:08:14,171 --> 02:08:15,910
you know you do work and then you're like,

2107
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:18,910
oh you're looking forward to that
vacation kind of thing. But it was like,

2108
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:20,650
oh you have a trip planned but you
haven't been working that hard.

2109
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:23,560
You'd like the Brown one. I like, I
want to stock up on a bunch of hard,

2110
02:08:23,561 --> 02:08:25,690
hard work so I can enjoy that.
Vicky. You know what I mean?

2111
02:08:25,691 --> 02:08:30,100
So the vacation seems more appealing.
Same thing. Yeah. It feels good.

2112
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:32,620
It feels good. Give it a try.
Check with your doctors. Right.

2113
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:36,340
I guess what sue before you fast.
But nonetheless,

2114
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:39,610
if back to the speed bump thing,
if you hit your mom,

2115
02:08:39,611 --> 02:08:41,090
so we know we can carry this through.

2116
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:47,040
Why psychological warfare is good
because sometimes you hit those malls,

2117
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:50,740
you've said about it, you never said,
hey, you can get it on apple, iTunes,

2118
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:55,360
Amazon music. You never even gave out the
goods. Not yet. I was about to big time.

2119
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:57,100
I was about to demonstrate
the whole thing,

2120
02:08:57,101 --> 02:09:00,680
but you already did and I thank you for
it. Cause I don't think we're doing a,

2121
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:05,590
also on Amazon you can get Jocko
white tea, which uh, you know,

2122
02:09:05,591 --> 02:09:10,591
there's been a lot of scientific studies
done and a lot of people have tried it.

2123
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:15,340
We have witnesses.
You can absolutely dead lift 8,000 pounds,

2124
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:17,620
including Jordan Peterson by the way.
Yeah.

2125
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:21,550
He's now dead left and he's only dead
lifting 7,000 pounds before and this is

2126
02:09:21,551 --> 02:09:25,690
coming from him now he's dead
lifting 8,000 pounds, so that's good.

2127
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:28,420
Jocko white tea.
There's some great reviews on there.

2128
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:29,950
You might want to read those.
Uh,

2129
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:34,930
we've got some books way the
warrior kid shows kids the path.

2130
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:37,930
The next warrior kid book
is coming out April 28th

2131
02:09:40,030 --> 02:09:42,790
so you can let you know
when you can get that.

2132
02:09:42,791 --> 02:09:44,920
I don't know when you can right now,
but that's when it's coming out.

2133
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:47,020
I'm done writing it,
just doing editing now.

2134
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:52,330
And also there's the book we talked
about earlier, extreme ownership. Rip My,

2135
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:56,980
me and my brother Leif Babin
and the new additions out.

2136
02:09:57,370 --> 02:09:59,290
Combat leadership for business in life.

2137
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:03,310
There's a lot of lessons in
there you can learn from it.

2138
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,290
I learned from it

2139
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:10,210
also the discipline equals
freedom field manual.

2140
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:13,330
And when you say that,
you got to say it like that

2141
02:10:15,550 --> 02:10:18,850
because sometimes people don't,
don't want to say field manual.

2142
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:23,040
When someone pointed it out, I don't know.
They just say it was discipline. Yeah.

2143
02:10:23,710 --> 02:10:25,120
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

2144
02:10:26,090 --> 02:10:30,190
A guy who said today on social
media, on Twitter, he hit,

2145
02:10:30,210 --> 02:10:33,980
he hit it up and you said, hey, it's
a field manual. It's not a book you

2146
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,810
don't read from cover to cover.

2147
02:10:35,870 --> 02:10:40,130
It's a field manual so you take it out
when you need it. Yeah. You refer to it.

2148
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:43,580
You go through it. Maybe go through
a onetime, cause it's not long,

2149
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:48,440
not a long read. This ain't about
face by Colonel David Hackworth.

2150
02:10:48,441 --> 02:10:52,190
You can probably read this in two hours,

2151
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:57,080
three hours. Sure. Then
once you've read it,

2152
02:10:57,110 --> 02:11:00,740
you go back to it. Yeah. The field manual

2153
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:06,940
teaching you how to get after
it mentally and physically.

2154
02:11:07,750 --> 02:11:12,660
The thoughts and actions that you can
take to get better opportune time bought

2155
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:16,060
people. Got It for Christmas. Now
they're implementing new years.

2156
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:18,020
Good

2157
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,790
new years resolution.

2158
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:25,760
Also a lot of people still asking for the
Audio version of the discipline equals

2159
02:11:25,761 --> 02:11:28,940
freedom field manual.
It is not on audible.

2160
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:34,070
It is on iTunes, Amazon music,
Google play and other MP,

2161
02:11:34,071 --> 02:11:37,490
three broadcasting platforms.
That's where you can get it

2162
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:44,560
if you need further implementation in
your business or your organization or your

2163
02:11:44,931 --> 02:11:48,560
team. Beyond the podcast and beyond
the books. We have echelon front,

On top of that we have the muster.

2168
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:06,813
Yeah,

2169
02:12:06,910 --> 02:12:08,380
the monster is a

2170
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:15,410

2176
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:42,470
That's cool. We are actually
on the interwebs, Twitter,

2177
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:46,510
Instagram
and FAC.

2178
02:12:47,610 --> 02:12:49,560
Echo is an echo.

2179
02:12:49,561 --> 02:12:53,280
Charles and I am at Jockowillink and
thank you for listening to the show and

2180
02:12:53,281 --> 02:12:56,640
thanks to those of you that are
listening that make this show possible.

2181
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:03,000
Those of you in the armed services
that are out there on the front lines

2182
02:13:03,030 --> 02:13:04,110
worldwide,

2183
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:08,910
keeping peace and protecting
our freedoms to police,

2184
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:13,380
law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,
and the other first responders.

2185
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:18,740
Thanks for holding the line here at
home and keeping our families safe.

2186
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:23,850
Thank you for your service
as well and to everyone.

2187
02:13:25,650 --> 02:13:26,483
Remember

2188
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:31,860
that even now,
the clock is bringing closer,

2189
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:35,310
closer to that moment.

2190
02:13:37,270 --> 02:13:42,270
So train hard and work hard and do
everything you can to be prepared.

2191
02:13:44,171 --> 02:13:48,550
So when that time does come,
you can step up

2192
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:51,093
and get after it.

2193
02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:56,360
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko.
