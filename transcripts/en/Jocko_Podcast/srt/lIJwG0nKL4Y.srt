00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,120
This is Jocko podcast number
14 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,520
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,663
Now

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,160
I want you to imagine yourself

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,320
in the moment,
the moment,

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,900
just prior to the battle.
Now,

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,230
I don't want you to think
that because you're a soldier,

8
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:39,231
that this training has made you into some
kind of a superhuman or maybe you and

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,390
to a different kind of
being because it hasn't,

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,600
the training that you've
been through hasn't changed.

11
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,640
The fact that you're a human being.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,740
All warriors are human beings.
So this is you I'm talking to

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,300
and I want you to think about that time
before you are going into the battle

14
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,030
because that's the time
when you can actually think.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,503
Yeah.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,640
When you're waiting,
when you're waiting to go,

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,773
okay.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,860
And if you're going to feel fear,

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,110
this is where you feel
it because you have time,

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,970
the preparation is done, the planning
is done, the briefing is done,

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,410
the gear is prepared and you are
dressed and you are ready to go.

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,830
And now you're just waiting,

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,210
waiting for the call or for
the signal or for the command

24
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,460
to execute.

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,650
And so you have time to think.
And in fact,

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,750
all you can do at that moment,

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,173
it's thick.

28
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,510
And if you're in Iraq,

29
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,430
maybe you're waiting to go
into the [inaudible] district
or Ramadi where there's

30
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:07,431
been vicious IED and casualties
happening every day for months on end.

31
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,450
Or if you're in Vietnam,

32
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,920
maybe you're in a helicopter and you're
about to take part in an air assault on

33
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:19,900
a known enemy stronghold.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,160
Yeah.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,710
Or if you're in the Korean War,

36
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,920
maybe you're hearing the whistles,

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,700
the whistles signaling a coordinated
attack by the Red Army and you're just

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,050
waiting,
waiting for the shooting to start.

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,540
And if it's world war two,

40
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,930
maybe you're just off shore and you're
in a landing craft and the sound of

41
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,740
explosions and gunfire in the distance
on the beach where you're headed,

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,720
the beach you're waiting to hit.

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,500
And if it's world war one,

44
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,360
perhaps you're waiting in Europe
10 and Burger Verdun or the psalm,

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,380
but you're waiting to go over
the top out of that trench

46
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,820
and into almost certain death.

47
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,610
And in that moment,

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,460
what do you think about,
do you think about family,

49
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,240
friends? You think about your
life, do you think about death?

50
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,370
You think about that girl you, you wished
that you would have asked to marry.

51
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,020
Maybe you're thinking, how
did I get myself into this?
Or maybe you're thinking,

52
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:48,000
how do I get myself out of this?

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,140
Or maybe you're just sitting
there rethinking the plan
and the sequence and the

54
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,460
orders you were given.

55
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,290
Maybe you're thinking about your friends

56
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,400
getting killed or wounded.

57
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,730
Maybe you're thinking about
yourself getting killed or wounded.

58
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,410
You could be thinking about
so many different things,

59
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,360
but one thing is certain,

60
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:25,720
whatever you are thinking about,
whatever those thoughts are,

61
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,130
those thoughts are clear.

62
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,110
Those thoughts or an insight
into your true nature,

63
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,520
into your being,

64
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,770
into your soul.

65
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,970
And maybe that's the thing.

66
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,280
Maybe that's the thing we miss
about combat. And you know,

67
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,480
we always hear about the adrenaline rush
and the excitement and the challenge of

68
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,314
combat,

69
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,650
but what about

70
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,150
the cleansing of the mind
against a backdrop of death?

71
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,950
It seems like there's,

72
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,010
there's some purity that can only be
revealed by the horror and the blood and

73
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:29,150
the violence of impending combat.

74
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,300
Eh,
and as you think these thoughts,

75
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:41,301
and there's this moment when you
realize that who's killing us

76
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,420
is us. It's other people.
It's other humans.

77
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,310
And, and, and what are they
thinking? Who are they?

78
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,640
Why are they,
what are they

79
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,230
and what am I doing
here? Why, why am I here?

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,980
And despite all those Fox and all
those ideas and all those questions,

81
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,080
there's only one answer.

82
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,840
And the politics,
they disappear and the thoughts disappear.

83
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,890
And the fears and the reservations
and the concern and the ego,

84
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,380
it all disappears

85
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,050
because at that moment,
that moment of truth,

86
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,700
there's only one answer

87
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,473
forward,

88
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,810
forward into the battle,
into the fray,

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
toward the smoke and the fire and the
bullets and the bombs and towards death

90
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,170
to face it or head on.

91
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,110
And maybe maybe that is what
the real addiction of combat is.

92
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,590
Maybe that's what we yearn for.

93
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,770
Maybe those.

94
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:30,980
Okay.

95
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,370
Those are the thoughts
that feel our dreams

96
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,830
and are nightmares to be
there again in the breach.

97
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,373
Yeah.

98
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:49,210
To have button one clear and resoundingly
purpose for everything in our lives.

99
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:56,490
Everything in our world,
everything in past and present in future.

100
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,110
All of it wrapped up

101
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,110
into that one instant

102
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,790
to have that one singular purpose
for being alive at that moment

103
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,480
to attack,

104
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,770
attack with everything you have
with every ounce of commitment,

105
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,010
with every bit of clarity and focus
that you as a human being can possibly

106
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:29,934
muster.

107
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I tack with your weapons and your mind
and your body and attack with your very

108
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,330
soul

109
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,890
and maybe that purity.

110
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,190
He's a what we miss.

111
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,590
He's what I miss

112
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,650
about combat

113
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,990
and so let's go back there once again,

114
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,590
once again to the battlefield
to World War One. Again,

115
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,030
in my mind,
the most brutal of all wars,

116
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,650
war tactics and intelligence
and strategy did not matter.

117
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,050
It was attrition and death and horror

118
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,050
rendered possible only because of
the purest and almost insane level of

119
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:54,290
selflessness and bravery,

120
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,750
and this starts off in that very
situation waiting for combat.

121
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,023
Okay?

122
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I sat up for a long time that night in
the foreboding eve of battle mood of

123
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:29,361
which all soldiers at all times have
left report on a tree stump clustered

124
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,390
around with blue anemones.

125
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,860
Before I crept over the ranks
of my comrades to the tent.

126
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,600
I had tangled dreams in which a
principal role was played by a skull

127
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,960
in the morning.

128
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,990
The tender green of young leaves
shimmered in the flat light.

129
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,690
We followed hidden twisting paths toward
a narrow gorge behind the front line.

130
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,920
On the dot of noon,

131
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,060
our artillery launched into a furious
bombardment that echoed and react code

132
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:09,810
through the hall though the
wooded hollows for the first time,

133
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,560
we heard what was meant by
the expression drum fire.

134
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,080
We sat perched on her habit,
have her Sachs idle and excited.

135
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,370
A runner plunged through the
company to the company commander.

136
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,830
Brisk exchange.

137
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,790
The three nearest trenches have fallen
to us and six field guns had been

138
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,624
captured.

139
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,250
Loud cheers rang out of
feeling of up and Adam

140
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,670
at last at last,

141
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,260
the long for order in a long line,

142
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,710
we move forward toward the
pattern of heavy rifle fire.

143
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,000
It was getting serious to
the side of the forest path.

144
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,130
Goal thumps came down in a clump of furs,

145
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,620
bringing down a rain of branches and soil,

146
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,010
one nervous soldier through
themselves to the ground.

147
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,840
Then deaths call slip through the ranks.

148
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,940
Ambulance men to the front.

149
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,340
Okay.

150
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,160
A little later we passed
the spot that had been hit.

151
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,860
The casualties had already been removed.

152
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,390
Bloody scraps of cloth and flesh had been
left on the bushes around the crater.

153
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,900
A strange and dreadful site that put me
in mind of the butcher bird that spikes

154
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:26,190
it's prey on thorn bushes.

155
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,970
We entered the battle trampled
realm of the infantry men.

156
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,750
The area around the jumping off position
had been deforested by the shells and

157
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:43,990
the ripped up no man's land
lay the victims of the attack
still facing the enemy.

158
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,020
They're great tunics.
Barely stood out from the ground.

159
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,600
A giant form with red blood.
Spattered beard stared fixedly at the sky.

160
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,090
His fingers clutching this spongey ground.

161
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,760
A young man tossed in a shell crater is
features already yellow with impending

162
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:04,240
death.
He seemed not to want to be looked at.

163
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,220
He gave us a cross shrug and pulled
his coat over his head and lay still

164
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,610
in a curious failure of comprehension.

165
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,200
I looked alertly about me for possible
targets for all this artillery fire,

166
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,620
not apparently realizing that
it was actually ourselves,

167
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:25,820
that the enemy enemy gunners were
trying for all they were worth to hit.

168
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,930
Ambulancemen.

169
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,670
We had our first fatality or shrapnel
ball had rip through riflemen stone.

170
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,860
Stallers caught carotid artery.

171
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,960
Three packets of lint were sodden with
blood and no time in a matter of seconds.

172
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,400
He bled to death
in the rising mist.

173
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,580
I leapt out of the trench and found
a shrunk in French corpse flesh like

174
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:55,020
moldering fish cleaned greenlit greenish
Lee through slits in the shredded

175
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:59,310
uniform turning around.
I took a step back in horror next to me.

176
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:01,140
It was a figure crouched against a tree.

177
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,750
It still had gleaming French leather
harness and on its back was a fully packed

178
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,390
haversack topped by a round mess tin.

179
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,680
Okay.

180
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Empty eye sockets and a few strands of
hair on fire on the bluish black skull

181
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,750
indicated that the man
was not among the living.

182
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,290
Okay.

183
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,370
There was another sitting down slumped
forward towards his feet as though we had

184
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:29,960
just collapsed all around
were dozens more rotted,

185
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,910
dried, stiffened to mummy's
frozen in Erie, dance of death.

186
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,290
The French must've spent months in the
proximity of their phone comrades without

187
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,124
bearing them.

188
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,620
A headless torso was jammed
in some shot up beams,

189
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,670
head and neck were gone. White cartilage
cleaned out of a reddish black flesh.

190
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,150
Okay.

191
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,230
I found it difficult to fathom
next to this very young man,

192
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,350
lay on his back with glassy eyes and
fist still aiming a peculiar feeling

193
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,960
looking into dead questioning eyes.

194
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,620
A shutter that I'd never quite
lost in the course of the war.

195
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,820
Has pockets had been turned inside out
and his empty wallet lay beside him.

196
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,463
Okay,

197
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,870
so that right there is a portion of the
opening chapters of a book called storm

198
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,500
of steel.

199
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,510
Going into the introduction of the book.

200
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:45,110
It's a storm of steel is one of
the great books of World War One,

201
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,890
if not the greatest. Ernst, younger.

202
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,920
That's the author Earth youngers book on
the 1914 war storm of steel is without

203
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:59,690
question the finest book on war
that I know, utterly honest,

204
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,060
truthful in good faith

205
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,000
in contrast with most
of the others is stark.

206
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,710
It has no pacifist design.
It makes no personal appeal.

207
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,940
It is notably unconstructed book.

208
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,250
It does not set its author and his
experience in any sort of context.

209
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,910
It offers nothing in the way of how's and
why's it is pure where and when and of

210
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:32,870
course above all what

211
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,790
there is nothing in it
about the politics of war,

212
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,920
nothing even on its outcome

213
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,510
and very little on the wider
strategy of its conduct.

214
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,230
War is all fighting is all.
Everything else is cropped away

215
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,090
and from first to last in the affirmative,

216
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,100
it is the work of a man whom the war made.

217
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,443
Yeah.

218
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,670
So it's a little bit of a different kind
of book that was someone explaining the

219
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,830
boot, someone explaining
the book and just how it is.

220
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,210
It's just about the fighting. Yeah.
So just throw just about the right.

221
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,330
Yeah.
And

222
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,740
that's one of the things
that makes it so powerful.

223
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:38,120
And it's also one of the
things that reflects very
well what it feels like to be

224
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:41,750
on the front lines. Yeah.
When politics don't matter,

225
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,940
when the outcome doesn't even matter,

226
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:48,680
the outcome of the broader war doesn't
matter anymore to what are we doing right

227
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,470
now? This trench? Mm

228
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,463
hmm.

229
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,830
Talking about being in these
trenches, which he, you know,

230
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:02,590
obviously all these soldiers
spent an immense amount of time.

231
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:04,180
They lived in these trenches.

232
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,080
Back to the book,

233
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,140
the desolation and the profound silence
sporadically broken by the crump of

234
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:17,320
shells were heightened by the,
sorry impression of devastation,

235
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,500
ripped have or Saks broken rifles,

236
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:25,030
scraps of cloth counter pointed
grotesquely with children's toys.

237
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,110
Shell fuses deep craters from explosions,
bottles,

238
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,880
harvest implements, shredded
books, battered household gear,

239
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,520
holes, who's gaping? Darkness,

240
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:40,630
betrayed the presence of basements where
the bodies of unlucky inhabitants of

241
00:18:40,631 --> 00:18:42,490
the houses were nod by the,

242
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:47,491
particularly a city of swarms of rats
in the cattle buyers and stables and

243
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:52,840
Barnes, the bones of livestock
still dangling from their chains.

244
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Trenches dug through ravaged gardens
in amongst sprouting bulbs of onions,

245
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,193
warm board,

246
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Rhubarb Narcissus buried under
weeds on the neighboring fields,

247
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:09,880
grain Barnes through whose roofs grain.
The grain was already sprouting.

248
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,170
All that with half buried communication,
trench running through it,

249
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,390
and all suffused with the
smell of burning and decay.

250
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,070
Sad thoughts are apt to sneak up on the
warrior in such a low cow when he thinks

251
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:31,330
of those who only recently led
their lives and tranquility.

252
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,050
So he's actually providing a little
caution to people. A little caution,

253
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,460
the warriors that when you see,

254
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,580
you know these babies toys and there's
normal village that's been ripped and

255
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:49,351
Alice trenches running through it and
you can't let that sneak up on you.

256
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,910
He says that he motion,
you've got to detach yourself from that.

257
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,070
And speaking of the rats

258
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,660
here,
he says they are repellent creatures.

259
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,650
And I'm always thinking of the secret
desecrations they perform on the bodies

260
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:10,120
and the village basements.

261
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,160
Once as I was striding through the
ruins of Monaco monkey on a warm night,

262
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,460
they came oozing out of their hiding
places in such undescribable numbers that

263
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:25,861
the ground was like a long carpet of
them pattern with the occasional white of

264
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:26,884
an albino,

265
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,150
so so many rats,
first of all,

266
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,600
so many rats that it looks like a carpet
in so many rats that there's actually a

267
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,760
regular occurrence of albino rats.

268
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,910
That's a lot of rats

269
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,220
and talking about life in the trench,
we're real renaissance. Back to the book,

270
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,180
we were real renaissance men who can turn
our hands to anything and the trenches

271
00:20:57,181 --> 00:21:00,300
make their thousand fold
demands on us every day.

272
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,940
We sink deep shafts,
construct dug outs and concrete pillboxes,

273
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,450
RigUp wire entanglements,
divine drainage systems,

274
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,170
revet support level raise and
smooth fill in latrines in a word.

275
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,020
We do all possible tasks ourselves.

276
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,390
So these guys are in the business
of constructing their house,

277
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:27,630
constructing the trenches that they
live in. They live in these dug outs,

278
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:30,630
which is like a lower part of
the trench where they dig in,

279
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,740
they build all this stuff themselves
and that's what they do and then in the

280
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:38,850
middle of that, back to the
book, a century collapses,

281
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,030
streaming blood shot in the head,

282
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,820
his comrades rip the bandage roll out
of his tunic and get him bandaged up.

283
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,510
There's no point bill, come on.
He's still breathing, isn't he?

284
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,270
Than the stretchers bearers come along
to carry him to the dressing station.

285
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,650
The stretcher poles collide with
the corners of the fire base.

286
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,560
No sooner has the man disappeared.

287
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,850
Then everything is back to the way
it was before someone's spreads.

288
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:13,650
If you shovel fulls of earth over the
red puddle and everyone goes back to

289
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:14,700
whatever he was doing,

290
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,780
only a new recruit maybe leans against
the revetment looking a little green

291
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,850
about the gills.
He's endeavoring to put it all together,

292
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,480
such an incredibly brutal assault so
sudden with no warning given it can't be

293
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:36,100
possible. It can't be real poor fellow.

294
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,180
If only you knew what
was in store for you.

295
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,053
Okay.

296
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,300
Seven October,

297
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,410
1915 standing at dawn on the fire.

298
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:59,350
Step opposite our dug out next to the
century when a rifle bullet ripped through

299
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:03,880
his forage cap without harming a
hair on his head. At the same time,

300
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,160
two pioneers were wounded on the wires.

301
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,490
One had a ricochet thought
shot through both legs,

302
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,090
the other a ball through
his ear in the morning.

303
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,420
The century out on our flank was shot
through both cheekbones the blood spurted

304
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,610
out of him in thick gouts and to capitol.

305
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,170
When Lieutenant von [inaudible]
Wald visiting our sector
to take pictures of SAP

306
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,640
and barely 50 yards away turn
to climb down from the outlook,

307
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,850
a bullet shattered the back of
his skull and he died on the spot.

308
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,220
Large fragments of skull were left
littering the century platform.

309
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,330
Also, a man was hitting
the shoulder but not badly.

310
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,100
The middle, the platoon section of
trench was attack with six inch shells.

311
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,100
One man was hurled against
a post by the blast so hard.

312
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,570
He sustained serious internal injuries
and a splinter of wood punctured the

313
00:23:56,571 --> 00:24:00,710
artery in his arm that night.
Two men were wounded.

314
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,810
Qualin sport unschooling wire

315
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,840
boot Schmidt was shot in both hands and
one five and Schaefer took a bullet in

316
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:13,430
the knee following a torrential
downpour in the night.

317
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,230
All the traverses came down and formed
a gray sludge, porridge with the rain.

318
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Turning the trench into a deep swamp are
only consolation was that the British

319
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,850
were just as badly off as we were because
we could see them bailing out for all

320
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:33,620
they were worth. Since our position has
a little more elevation than theirs,

321
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,660
we even managed to pump our
excess there way. So here it is,

322
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,320
they're almost face to
face with the British.

323
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:47,060
They're getting rid downpour of rain
and they take a little satisfaction.

324
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:50,960
The fact that they can actually funnel
some of the water into the British trench,

325
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:52,280
that's how close they are.

326
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,633
Okay.

327
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,200
The crumbled trench walls explode,

328
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,850
expose a line of bodies left there
from the previous autumn's fighting.

329
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:10,250
I was standing next to territorial
Wiegmann in front of the Outenberg readout

330
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,600
when a long shot pass through his bayonet,

331
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,300
which he was carrying over his shoulder
and gave him a bad wound in the groin.

332
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,480
So this is kind of the daily life that
he talks about being stuck in these

333
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:27,840
trenches

334
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,240
and it's just brutal.

335
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,270
It's brutal.
And you can kind of get the,

336
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,640
the matter of factness that he
delivers so much of this with take, oh,

337
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,320
this guy was shot,
this guy was shot,

338
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,850
this guy who had his leg blown off
each just like boom, boom, boom,

339
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,893
boom.

340
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,270
You know when he mentioned how he noticed
someone else reacting to that when

341
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:56,640
meanwhile it's just a real
matter of fact to him, but right.

342
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,140
Just the other guy reacting to it stands
out, you know, that's all matter of fact.

343
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:01,974
It is.

344
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,510
And the book,
which I kind of got in the beginning,

345
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,020
talked about some of this first combat
that he's exposed to when he goes on to

346
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:16,830
go through, I mean just
the battle, the song,

347
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,450
which is 60,000 casualties
in the first day,

348
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,140
60,000 casualties in the first day.
You know,

349
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:32,430
there was 58,000 killed in Vietnam.
I mean 58,000 Americans killed in Vietnam.

350
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,370
We're talking 60,000
casualties the first day.

351
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,090
And in three months there was a million,
a million.

352
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,080
It's, that's the whole state of,
by the way, it's, it's, it's,

353
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,030
it's unbelievable what this war was.
It really was.

354
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,150
And it's really unfathomable as I think
about what these guys were ordered to do.

355
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:00,990
And the fact that they did it
over and over and over again.

356
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,680
We,
we have,

357
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,560
we have more respect for human
life now than we did then,

358
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,900
period.
I don't care what anybody says.

359
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,290
We have more respect for human
life now than they did then.

360
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,930
Maybe that means were weaker.
Maybe it means we're more cowardly,

361
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,333
but

362
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,600
just to send millions of men to their
death for our river that didn't really

363
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:34,080
have any strategic impact
that that was true.

364
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,740
It's it, it's, it's, it's horrible.

365
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,660
It's horrible to think about.

366
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,920
And so now we're getting,
well, I leave that to,

367
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,920
for people to read,
you know,

368
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,580
the bulk of the middle of the book
where he goes into these details,

369
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,170
but then I kind of moving forward
here more towards the end of the book

370
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,240
and now we're getting into these

371
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,370
really pretty fierce battles.

372
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:14,940
And also what's interesting is this
is when he starts seeing the enemy,

373
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,680
like they can hear him
in the other trenches,

374
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,560
but now he start to
meeting them face to face

375
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,300
and indeed we heard on 29 November
from captain von Brixton that we were,

376
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,770
that we were to take part in a sweeping
counter offensive against the bulge that

377
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:35,670
the tank battle at Cambray
had made in our front.

378
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,830
Even though we are pleased to play a part
of the hammer having so long been the

379
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:41,400
anvil,

380
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,750
we wondered whether the troops still
exhausted from Flanders would be up to the

381
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,860
job. That said, I had every
confidence in my company.

382
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,630
They had never let anyone down.

383
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:55,860
Yet on the night of 30
November to one December,

384
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,660
we were put on Laurie's.
It's a truck and the process,

385
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,440
we took our first losses as a
soldier dropped a hand grenade,

386
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,340
which for some reason exploded
gravely injuring him and another man.

387
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,520
Someone else feigned insanity in
attempt to get out of the battle

388
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:21,230
after a lot of tooling and froing a buffet
in the ribs from an NCO seem to sort

389
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:24,540
him out and we were able to go.

390
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,820
It showed me that that sort of play
acting is difficult to keep up.

391
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,260
Now,

392
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,040
I've talked about this before and if you
didn't go the last time I talked about

393
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:41,240
it and look at this shellshocked
videos of world war one on Youtube,

394
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,500
there are [inaudible] to watch and you
realize what this war did to people.

395
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,680
And I pulled this section
out because he was a guy

396
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,940
who probably had gone completely
insane and he's like saying,

397
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,080
this guy feigned insanity. He just
said, you know what? This guy is faking.

398
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,520
You know, even though he probably was,
he probably was. He says, you know what?

399
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,210
Beat this guy up.
Tell them to suck it up and now we can go.

400
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:13,210
And that's exactly what happened.
That was kind of the attitude, right?

401
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,100
Remember you're saying that was
kind of the attitude back then?

402
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,780
It would absolutely was the attitude. It
was the attitude innate. They talk about,

403
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,280
I mean I've, I've paid more attention
to it on the British side, but Yo,

404
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,170
if you came back from the war

405
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,130
with all your limbs and you
went into a medical ward,

406
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:35,340
meaning you were in there because
you had psychological problems, they,

407
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,630
it was because you were a coward and
their minds. Yeah. Which is sick.

408
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,670
It's sickening. Yeah. Yeah.

409
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:49,671
I think how you were saying life met less
than or where it means more like human

410
00:30:49,711 --> 00:30:52,850
life. I think it's just the, it was
just the lack of knowledge, you know,

411
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,000
like they've looked into it over the
years and stuff and they kind of Co as far

412
00:30:57,001 --> 00:31:01,470
as the, as far as the PTSD and the shell
shock, everything. Yeah. Everything.

413
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,570
We've learned all kinds of about that.

414
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,430
But it is really horrible when you
see those videos of what they have,

415
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,180
what this war did to people.
And that's what war does do to people.

416
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,340
You know, we got to remember
that, that it impacts people in,

417
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:24,570
in a horrible way.
And this war to me,

418
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:26,640
especially more so than near the war,

419
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,660
primarily because of the
conditions and from the,

420
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,440
the indirect fire, the mortars
and the shelling. And again,

421
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:36,600
it's something that you
have no control over.

422
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,320
And also you could see these guys had
no control over their, their fate.

423
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,050
They're going to get told to do
something and they were going to do it.

424
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:49,370
And if you weren't going to do
it, you are a coward. You know,

425
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,430
if you were to protest and say,
hey,

426
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:53,250
this doesn't seem like a good plan
to me it wouldn't be well, okay,

427
00:31:53,251 --> 00:31:55,800
what's your strategic opinion?
What your tactical loop,

428
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,770
which your tactical brain tell
you knows? No, you're a coward.

429
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,820
And that's why it's so important
really in any endeavor,

430
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,850
especially in war, but
in war, in business too,

431
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,190
to have an open mind from a leadership
position to listen to what people are

432
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:16,710
saying because they might be right.
And here,

433
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:20,100
I guarantee you there were thousands and
thousands if not hundreds of thousands

434
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:23,970
of soldiers that would've said, hey, you
know what? This doesn't make any sense.

435
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,260
And part of it is incumbent upon
them to say, you know what? No,

436
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,050
I mean it's like we talked about
with the Polian Maxim, right?

437
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,790
Napoleon's maximum was if you are aware
of a problem with an order and you carry

438
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:42,020
it and you get your guys killed,
you're culpable. Nope, it's on you.

439
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,230
So these guys obviously hadn't read
that and head you don't get it.

440
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,150
Hadn't taken that on board. Will you
listen to your subordinates and you say,

441
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,530
okay, what do you think of this plan?
We've tried it 12 times in the past,

442
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,900
you know, a month and a half and
we're going to try it again tomorrow.

443
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,270
We're going to get up at the sound of
the whistle and we're going to charge

444
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,270
towards these other enemy machine guns.
It hasn't worked yet,

445
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,650
but we think it might work tomorrow.
No one figured that out.

446
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:14,950
Listen to your people and
listen to your brain. You know,

447
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,560
listened to your common sense.
Don't get stuck.

448
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,120
Don't get stuck in a
mental Rut with anything.

449
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,340
And it's so easy to look if you could
send millions of humans to their death

450
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,400
because you can't think your
way out of the strategy.

451
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:32,710
You can't identify a
strategy as being wrong.

452
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,410
You can't come up with a
new way to execute something

453
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:42,270
that shows you how trapped in a box your
brain can get and not only you but your

454
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:47,260
buddies that are all thinking the same
way and you're all feeding off each other

455
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:51,670
with incestual ideas that are the
same ideas being fed to one another

456
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,730
and it leads to this.
Back to the book.

457
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:05,580
Suddenly there was some commotion at
the British Barricade, hand grenades,

458
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:09,930
flu rifles, banged machine
guns. Clattered they're coming.

459
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,853
They're coming.

460
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,140
We leaped behind sandbags and started
shooting in the heat of the battle.

461
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,340
One of my men,

462
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:22,850
corporal kingpin house jumped onto the
parapet and fire down into the trench

463
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:26,280
until he was brought down by
two bad wounds in his arms.

464
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,500
I took note of this hero of the hour and
was proud to congratulate him two weeks

465
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:35,910
later on a ward of the Iron Cross.
First Class.

466
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,610
Okay.

467
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,390
No sooner had we got back from this
interruption to our lunch that there was

468
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:42,560
more pandemonium.

469
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,600
It was one of those curious incidents
that can suddenly and unpredictably

470
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:50,030
transform an entire situation.

471
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,380
The noise was coming from a Saab Altar
in the regimen on our left who wanted to

472
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,950
line up with us and seemed
inflamed by a buzzard.

473
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:08,290
Fury drink seemed to have tipped as
innate bravery into towering rage.

474
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,570
Where are the Tommys? Let me Adam,
come on boys. Who's coming with me?

475
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,130
Okay.

476
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,880
It is in snit fury.

477
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,960
He knocked over our fine
barricade and plunged forward,

478
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,080
clearing a path for
himself with hand grenades.

479
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,990
So this guy is, you know, going after it.

480
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,450
He's the, you know, he's described
as being like almost drunk.

481
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,040
Maybe he is drunk,

482
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,090
but he's just standing up and charging,

483
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,280
charging forward,

484
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:49,640
clearing a path for himself with
hand grenades back to the book.

485
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,010
His orderly slipped ahead
of them along the trench,

486
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:55,280
shooting down anyone who survived
the explosion. Explosions,

487
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,230
braverly bravery,

488
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,400
fearless risking of one's
own life is always inspiring.

489
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,390
We too found ourself,
ourselves,

490
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:09,430
picked up by his wild fury and scrabbling
around to grab a few hand grenades.

491
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,710
Rush to form part of this buzzer.

492
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:16,070
Ruckers project progress sooner.
I was up alongside him,

493
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,140
tearing along the line and the other
officers to followed by riflemen from my

494
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:21,974
company.

495
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,070
Okay.

496
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,760
Even captain von Brixton,

497
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,160
the battalion commander was up
there in the van rifle in hand,

498
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,560
bringing down enemy hand grenade throwers.

499
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,403
Okay.

500
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,450
The British resisted manfully.

501
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Every traverse had to be fought for four.

502
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,020
Okay.

503
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,240
The black balls of mill's bombs.

504
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:47,470
Those are British grenades crossed
in the air with our own long handled

505
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,950
grenades.
Behind every traverse we captured,

506
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,290
we found corpses or
bodies still twitching.

507
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,010
We killed each other sight unseen.

508
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,890
We too suffered losses.

509
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,610
A piece of iron crashed into
the ground next to the orderly,

510
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,800
which the fellow was unable to avoid
and he collapsed to the ground while his

511
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:13,520
blood issued onto the
clay from as many wounds.

512
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,580
Okay?

513
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,270
We hurt, we hurled, we hurdled
over his body and charged forwards.

514
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,270
Thunderous crashes pointed us to weigh.

515
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,410
Hundreds of pairs of eyes were lying in
wait behind rifles and machine guns in

516
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,570
dead man's land.

517
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,610
We were already a long way
from our own front lines,

518
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,540
from all sides.
Bullets whistled round.

519
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:40,110
Our steel helmets are struck the
trench parapet with a hard crack.

520
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,980
Each time a black iron
oval broke the horizon.

521
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,500
One's eyes sized it up.

522
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,770
With that instantaneous clarity of which
a man is only capable in moments of

523
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:57,360
life and death.
During those instances of waiting,

524
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,070
you had to try and get to a place where
you could see as much of the sky as

525
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:06,900
possible because it was only against it's
Pale backdrop that it was possible to

526
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:11,901
see the black Jaguar iron of those
deadly balls with sufficient clarity.

527
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,740
Then you hurled your own
bomb and leaped forward.

528
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,810
One barely glanced at the
crumpled body of one's opponents.

529
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,590
He was finished and a new
dual was commencing in the
exchange of hand grenades.

530
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,220
It reminded me of fencing with foils.

531
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,380
You needed a jump and stretch
almost as in a ballet.

532
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:42,050
It is the deadliest of duels
as it invariably ends with
one of the participants

533
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,230
or the other being blown to smithereens

534
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,460
or both

535
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,880
hand grenade fights.

536
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,090
And just to kind of explain that a
little bit, it's one thing that you,

537
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,230
that we definitely learned in the seal
teams when you're patrolling at night,

538
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,430
and this is especially before night vision
when you wanted to see the person in

539
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,700
front of you and especially like to see
their hand signals, cause we, you know,

540
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,550
we use all hand signals at night,
so if you want to see them,

541
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,630
you kind of get down on a knee
and you put the, you put the back,

542
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,420
the back light behind him so you
can see what handsome or passing.

543
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,410
And what he's doing here is they're
trying to get as low as they can and back

544
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:30,680
light the sky as much as they can so
they can see the grenades that are being

545
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:35,300
thrown at him.
And then when they do get thrown at them,

546
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:39,170
they try and get up to a spot where they
don't think it's gonna blow up and then

547
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,000
their Hac, their own grades. Back

548
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,730
in these moments,
I was capable of seeing the dead.

549
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,300
I jumped over them with
every stride without horror.

550
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,550
They lay there in they're relaxed and
softly spilled attitude that characterizes

551
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:05,090
those moments in which
life takes its leave.

552
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,900
Now they get the,

553
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,430
now they get the British kind of trapped

554
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,670
the trench. They were trying to escape
down, doubled back on itself towards ours,

555
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:25,671
like a curved frame of a lear and at the
narrowest point they were only 10 paces

556
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:31,140
apart, so they had to pass us
again from our elevated position.

557
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,890
We were able to look down on the British
helmets as they stumbled in their haste

558
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,580
and excitement. I tossed a hand
grenade in front of the first lot,

559
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:42,690
bringing them up short and
after them all the others.

560
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,230
Then they were stuck in a frightful jam.

561
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:52,050
Hand-Grenades flew through the air like
snowballs covering everything in milk.

562
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:56,370
White smoke, fresh bombs were
handed up to us from below.

563
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,950
Lightenings flashed between the huddle,

564
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:03,780
the British huddling up rags of
flesh and uniforms and helmets.

565
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,830
There were mingled cries of rage and fear

566
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,970
with fire in our eyes.

567
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,960
We jumped onto the very lip of the trench.

568
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,590
The rifles of the whole
area were pointed at us.

569
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,290
Suddenly in my delirium,

570
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:27,030
I was knocked to the ground
as by a hammer blow sober.

571
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,900
I pulled off my helmet and saw to my
terror that there were two large holes in

572
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:31,734
it.

573
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,190
Cadet Mormon leaping up to
assist me assured me that
I had a bleeding scratch at

574
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,630
the back of my head.
Nothing more.

575
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,820
A bullet shot from some distance had
punched through my helmet and it only

576
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,530
brushed my skull.

577
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,010
Okay,

578
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,150
half unconscious.

579
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,980
I reeled back with a Hurley
applied bandage to remove
myself from the eye of the

580
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:53,814
storm.

581
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,160
Okay?

582
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,160
No sooner had I passed the
nearest traverse that a man
ran up behind me and told

583
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:05,381
me that tab had just been killed in
the same place by a shot in the head.

584
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,560
The news floored me,

585
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,420
a friend of mine with noble
qualities with whom I shared joy,

586
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,790
sorrow and danger for years.

587
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:21,791
Now who only a few moments ago had
called out some pleasant treated me,

588
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,730
taken from life by a tiny piece of leg.

589
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,380
I could not grasp the fact.

590
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,960
Unfortunately it was all too true

591
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,670
in this murder.
A sector of trench.

592
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,690
All my ncrs and a third of my
company were bleeding to death.

593
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,670
Shots in the head,

594
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:51,671
rain down lieutenant hop than another
one was another one of the fallen and

595
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:54,380
older man I teacher by profession,

596
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,560
a German school master in the best sense
of the word my two ensigns and many

597
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:05,861
others besides were wounded and yet the
seventh company held onto the conquered

598
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:10,370
line under the command of
Lieutenant Hop and Raf,

599
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,990
the only able bodied officer
remaining until we relieved

600
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,300
of all the stimulating moments in a war.

601
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:26,650
There is none to compare
with the encounter of two
storm troop commanders in the

602
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:29,960
narrow clay walls of align.

603
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,340
There is no going back and no pity

604
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,900
and everyone knows who is
seen of them in their kingdom.

605
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,710
The aristocrat of the trench with hard
determine visage brave to the point of

606
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:55,581
folly leaping agily forward and
back with keen bloodthirsty eyes.

607
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,910
Men who answered the demands of the hour

608
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,370
and whose names go down in no chronicle.

609
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,060
And I think as we read these books,

610
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,310
write these books, these are
chronicles. Somebody wrote,

611
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,030
this guy lived in wrote,

612
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,490
but he's making a specific point here.

613
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,170
He, he uses the term, the
aristocrat of the trench.

614
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:40,210
And it's not the turning of the term
aristocrat that isn't, it's not the,

615
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:44,410
you know, the, the snobby
aristocrat. That's not what
he's talking about. You know,

616
00:44:44,411 --> 00:44:47,740
you look up the definition of Aristocrat
and one of the meanings of it is like

617
00:44:47,741 --> 00:44:51,640
the, the best of, so that's
what he's talking about.

618
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,700
These guys that were the best guys in
the trench that had the heart look that

619
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:00,700
would get after it.

620
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,540
And yet their names go down and no
chronicle. And I'll tell you, I know

621
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,180
many,

622
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,180
many brave men in the seal
teams in the Marine Corps,

623
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,780
in the army,

624
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:23,140
brave souls that were
all risk Kratz of war

625
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,460
and their name will go
down and no chronicle.

626
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,523
Hmm.

627
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,300
Uh,
later battle,

628
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,840
two men who had just ahead of us
tried to make it back over the top.

629
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,300
One toppled back into the
trench with a shot in the head.

630
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,840
The other shot in the belly
could only crawl into it.

631
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,480
We hunkered down on the floor to wait and
smoked English cigarettes from time to

632
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:56,810
time. Well aimed rifle
grenades came flying over.

633
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,260
We were able to see them
and take a vase of action.

634
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,470
The man with the wound in the belly,

635
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:07,070
a very young lad lay in amongst us,

636
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,150
stretched out like a cat in the
warm rays of the setting sun.

637
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:18,830
He slipped into death with an
almost childlike smile on his face.

638
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,340
It was a site that didn't depress me,

639
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,390
but left me with a fraternal
feeling for the dying man.

640
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,820
Even the groaning of his
comrade gradually fell silent.

641
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,400
He died in our midst shuttering.

642
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,330
It's that, that line,
they're really caught me.

643
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,890
Maybe he died in our midst shuttering.
And it's,

644
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,550
I think what catches you about,
it's because the other,

645
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,680
it's contracted with the other one who
died with an almost childlike smile on

646
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:06,030
his face.
And you know,

647
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,330
as I was thinking, when you see
this much deaf, it's like, you know,

648
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:14,331
when they say the Eskimos have
thousand words for snow because they,

649
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:19,411
they're so familiar with snow and these
men were faced with so much death that

650
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:24,330
they saw this,
the,

651
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,470
the varied faces of death and
how different they are. Yeah.

652
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:30,700
And you know,

653
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,510
one thing that I remember from some of
the older Vietnam seals talking to me

654
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:39,100
about guys that had been wounded, and
this is, you know, uh, in the 90s.

655
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:44,080
So I had no idea anything about combat.
And I remember like they were telling me,

656
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:47,970
hey, you know, sometimes guys get
wounded, big it shot in. It does,

657
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,930
it doesn't phase them. And it's
part of, it's the physiology.

658
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,620
Like if you get shot in a certain place,
each doesn't,

659
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,990
it just doesn't do
anything. You know, you can,

660
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:02,410
you can drive off and then you'll have
someone else get shot in a different

661
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:05,500
place. Yeah. And it just, it,
there's nothing you can do about it.

662
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:09,940
Like it blows their femur a part or it
hits their hip in such a way that they

663
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:10,451
cannot.

664
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:15,070
And they were just down in agonizing
pain where someone else may get shit shot

665
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:16,120
on a through and through.

666
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,540
Meaning it just goes in one side and
out the other and it's almost like they

667
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,690
don't even notice it. Yeah.
Cause it, it happens so fast,

668
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,150
happened so fast and it doesn't
cause any traumatic damage.

669
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,230
And then you have the psychological
aspect where some people psychologically

670
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:32,220
they get hit and they're freaking
out. Oh my God, I'm going to die.

671
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,620
And some other people or are, you
know, I got hit. Just leave me alone.

672
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:40,540
Hey I got this. Don't worry about me.
I ain't got time to bleed. Yeah. So,

673
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:45,310
so those are some situations that
you are just different.

674
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:49,990
And then it's the same thing obviously,
when this guy sees death after death,

675
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,120
after death,
after death,

676
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,560
he sees the variables and
the various faces of death.

677
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:00,863
Okay.

678
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,790
So now we're getting towards the end

679
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,830
and ease.
I mean,

680
00:49:12,831 --> 00:49:16,970
this is at a point now where
they're starting to recognize
that they're going to

681
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:18,560
lose the war.

682
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:24,560
And what's crazy about that is net
now, okay, if you, if you tell me, hey,

683
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,660
we're fighting for our
country, okay, I get it.

684
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:28,880
We're going to drive on and maybe
we're gonna make some sacrifices.

685
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:34,030
And these guys now recognize that
they're probably not going to win.

686
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,693
Hmm.

687
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,720
And he's kind of given his guys a brief
before they go into another assault.

688
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:48,350
I paraded my company in battle order in
a small apple orchard standing under an

689
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:50,430
apple tree.

690
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,430
I addressed a few words to the men who
were drawn up in front of me in a horse

691
00:49:55,711 --> 00:50:00,270
shoe arrangement.
They looked serious and manly.

692
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,720
There wasn't much to say in the
course of the last few days.

693
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,270
And with a kind of sweeping this,

694
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:14,130
that is only to be explained by the
fact that an army is not only men under

695
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:15,060
arms,

696
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:20,220
but also men fused with a
sense of common purpose.

697
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,940
Probably every one of them had come to
understand that we were on our uppers.

698
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,710
And on our uppers is an
expression that means

699
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,960
it's like when you're in poverty or
when you don't have the means anymore.

700
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,900
So they knew.
He knew that they were on their last legs.

701
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,450
They knew that they
were on their last legs.

702
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,200
He goes on with every attack.

703
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,610
The enemy came forward
with more powerful means.

704
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,760
His blows were swifter
and more devastating.

705
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,560
Everyone knew we could no longer win,

706
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,820
but we would stand firm.

707
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,123
Okay.

708
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,240
But we would stand firm.

709
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,980
Now they're in his final battle.

710
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,050
I had a very impartial feeling as if I
were able to view myself through by not

711
00:51:26,581 --> 00:51:30,540
colors. You can see ease
now becoming detached. Yeah.

712
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,780
For the first time in the entire war,

713
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:37,870
I heard the hissing of individual bullets
as if they were whistling past some

714
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:41,450
target.
We were coming downhill.

715
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:47,000
Indistinct figures moved against
a background of red, brown clay,

716
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,140
a machine gun spat out.
It's gouts of bullets.

717
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,160
The feeling of hopelessness
increased even.

718
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:59,900
So we broke into a run while the
gunners found we're finding their range.

719
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,040
We jumped over several snipers ness and
Hurley excavated trenches in mid jump

720
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,480
over a slightly better made trench.

721
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,540
I felt a piercing jolt in the chest as
though I'd been hit like a game bird with

722
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:21,800
a sharp cry that seemed to
cost me all the air I had.

723
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,490
I spun on my access and
crashed to the ground.

724
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,200
It had got me at last at the same
time as feeling I had been hit.

725
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,590
I felt the bullet taking away my life.

726
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,140
I had felt deaths hand once
before on the road at Maury,

727
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:47,450
but this time his grip was
firmer and more determined.

728
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:52,280
As I came down heavily on
the bottom of the trench,

729
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,870
I was convinced it was all over.
Strangely,

730
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:02,410
that moment is one of the very few in
my life of which I am able to say they

731
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:05,990
were utterly happy.

732
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,550
I understood as in a flash of lightning,

733
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,930
the true inner purpose
and form of my life.

734
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:21,190
I felt surprise and disbelief
that it was to end there and then,

735
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:28,030
but this surprise had something
untroubled and almost Mary about it.

736
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:35,660
Then I heard the firing grow less as if
I were a stone sinking under the surface

737
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,500
of some turbulent water

738
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,470
where I was going.
There was neither war

739
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,090
nor
enmity.

740
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,323
Okay.

741
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:00,583
Well

742
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:06,610
obviously he did survive that wounding
because he was able to write this book

743
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:09,350
and he wrote many other books.

744
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,840
The book is called storm of steel

745
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,050
by Ernst.
Sticky younger.

746
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,723
Okay.

747
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:39,890
Yeah. And as I wrap up these books, again,

748
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,880
sometimes I feel like, you know, hey,

749
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:47,480
where do I compare this?
How do I tie it in?

750
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,200
Okay,

751
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,541
enemy.

752
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:55,420
Now obviously there's lessons in
leadership and stir trategy and you know,

753
00:54:55,421 --> 00:55:00,421
I talked a little bit about listening
to your troops and keeping an open mind.

754
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,983
Okay.

755
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,590
And even though,

756
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,100
yeah,

757
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,600
you know, they started off
in the description of this
book is saying, you know,

758
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:18,710
there's no pacifist leaning in this book,

759
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,980
but something that I often remind people

760
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:30,803
okay

761
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,810
about, well, the guys
that have fought in wars

762
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,130
is that if there's anybody,

763
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:44,540
okay

764
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:49,340
that looks at war and says,
let's try to avoid it if we can.

765
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,770
It's the guys that have been there,
the guys that have fought,

766
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:01,070
we don't want to send our friends to war,
we don't want to send kids to war.

767
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,520
And I think this book is a reminder.

768
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:08,503
Okay.

769
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,100
Of just how bad it can be

770
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:15,150
and just how horrible,

771
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:20,100
well a thing that war is.

772
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,171
Now,

773
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:28,171
of course that always comes with the
caveat of the fact that there are things

774
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:30,190
that are more evil than war

775
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,530
and there are things
that can only be stopped.

776
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:39,531
There is evil that can only be
stopped through the waging of war.

777
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,910
But when you do have to
go to war because the evil

778
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:51,790
must be stopped,

779
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,680
then go to award a win and win decisively.

780
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,010
So you don't put men

781
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,350
through horrors

782
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,603
for nothing.

783
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,170
Going back to that, the part
where you're talking about, um,

784
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:27,490
guys getting hit and they deal with in
different people just have different

785
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:28,324
reactions

786
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,520
when it's that kind of blow
like a bullet happened so fast.

787
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,060
I don't think your nerves really register
of it depends on where you hit because

788
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,310
you're,
the bullet could go through your arm.

789
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,550
You don't notice it or go through
your arm and hit your, your bone.

790
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:48,330
Graze the bone. Yeah, I could
hit the bone. It could shout
to the bone. Yeah, I know.

791
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,480
I saw guys that got hit in
the bone and it's devastating.

792
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,860
Yeah. And you see guys that got through
and through and your, and they're fine.

793
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,990
Literally fine. Yeah. And so
that's, you know, war is a, uh,

794
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:07,670
there's a, there's a, there's a
huge element of chance in it. Yeah.

795
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:08,920
And you know,
I actually got,

796
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,310
there was an internet question that I
got asked and I didn't, I don't think we,

797
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,430
we brought it up,
but it was basically somebody saying,

798
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:20,320
how do you deal with the randomness of
war? Like you could just, how do you do,

799
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,820
how do you deal with
the randomness of war?

800
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,110
And for me it's the way I dealt
with the random acts of war is,

801
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,610
is the really simple thought of I'm
going to control what I can control.

802
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,390
And if I can't control it, I'm
not going to worry about it. Yeah.

803
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,480
You can't worry about the
random sniper shot. I mean,

804
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,060
you can do everything you
can to mitigate it. You know,

805
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:43,120
when you're out there in the field,
you know, you keep moving, moving,

806
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,890
you stay behind,
cover as much as you can.

807
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:47,020
You don't came up in the same
spot over and over again.

808
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:49,690
You do the the things
to mitigate the risk,

809
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:55,210
but you can't just be dwelling on it.
Right, because you can't control it.

810
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,030
Yeah.

811
00:58:56,030 --> 00:59:00,820
The same thing of getting hit with a
random IED or a random of indirect fire

812
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:04,330
from a mortar.
You cannot mitigate all that risk.

813
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,610
So what do you do?

814
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:11,650
You do everything you can to
mitigate it and then you know,

815
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:13,270
you worry about the
things you can control.

816
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,600
And I used to tell that to MMA fighters
too, and I'm, I've told that story before.

817
00:59:16,601 --> 00:59:17,434
You know,
listen,

818
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,650
guys are getting worried they're going
to get knocked out or they're going to

819
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:22,010
get caught a submission. It's a, Hey,

820
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,620
you've done everything you can
to mitigate that. You've trained,

821
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:28,400
you've conditioned yourself,
you've sparred, you've done Mitch,

822
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:32,630
you've done everything that you can do.
If that happens, you can't control it.

823
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,170
If it happens, you can't control
it. So don't even worry about it.

824
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,410
Worry about the things you can control.
The pace of the fight,

825
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,340
putting the fight where you want it to
be. Winning the rounds, being a tactician,

826
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,690
worry about those things. Don't worry
about getting knocked out. You know what,

827
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:52,460
keep your hands up. Keep your head
movement, keep the distance incorrect.

828
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,100
Those are the things that are going to
keep you it from getting knocked out,

829
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,480
but you can't mitigate all
that risk. You're in a fist
fight and in a fist fight.

830
00:59:59,481 --> 00:59:59,960
Some people,

831
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,960
sometimes people get what knocked out
and in a war sometimes people get wounded

832
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:10,490
and sometimes people get killed and
you cannot mitigate that risk away.

833
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:13,310
It's a war and you got to deal with it.

834
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,050
I remember, this is gonna sound kind of
funny comparatively speaking, but um,

835
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,430
I shot my own hand one time was what? A
BB gun. You know the kind with the CLT.

836
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,430
You don't have to tell this
story to the public. You know

837
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,430
there's a lesson in there though. It's not
even a lesson. It's like less than one.

838
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:34,680
It's don't shoot your hand with a gun.
It was done.

839
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:37,350
It was one of those ones where
you know that you put the Cot.

840
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,950
So it just changed the seal two
cartridge and I was like, Hey,

841
01:00:40,951 --> 01:00:42,240
there's no Bibi's in here,

842
01:00:42,241 --> 01:00:46,390
so I'm going to see just how strong
does this air feel, you know,

843
01:00:46,391 --> 01:00:49,540
with the brand new CEO too
and there a BB in there.

844
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,640
And so I shot it and I
didn't feel anything.

845
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,780
That's the weird thing is why I say so
when I shot it and went the BB went and

846
01:00:57,781 --> 01:01:00,060
it went deep in there and went in.

847
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,750
I didn't see it and I saw this little
kind of like our little ring, you know,

848
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:06,570
like a little tab, a skin just appeared.
And I was like, what? You know,

849
01:01:06,571 --> 01:01:09,600
like I felt the air. I was like, that's
some pretty strong air. And then kind of,

850
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,020
you know, a few seconds went by
and um, I feel just this pressure,

851
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:16,140
like someone's like kind of squeezing
my hand a little bit with their fingers.

852
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:20,880
And I was like kind of confused because I,
of course I didn't,

853
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:25,570
there was no BB in there. I knew that
from the beginning and I don't know that.

854
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,730
Right. Yeah. I'm saying that's what I'm
thinking at the time. And then maybe,

855
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:30,001
you know,

856
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:35,001
maybe 10 seconds or so it just starts
gushing blood and it comes to [inaudible]

857
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,280
but no pain, no pain. And you know,

858
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,940
and I kind of like you start kind of
blacking out. I think he was, I was,

859
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:45,890
I was like 12 years old. Um, I start
kind of blacking out. It's, and what,

860
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,280
what happened was the B,

861
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:52,230
the BB went through and got
lodged in my tendons under there.

862
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,290
So it took like three surgeries to
get it out. You know, the first one,

863
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:58,230
he just reached in there second when he
cut a little bit and then the third one,

864
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,240
um,
they'd just cut my head open.

865
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,560
They had to like move the tendons to
the side and like grab it. It was bad.

866
01:02:04,561 --> 01:02:09,120
But the point is there was no pain. Yeah.
Cause it just happens so fast, you know?

867
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,230
Actually that's one point.

868
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:13,650
The other point is always treat
weapons as if they're loaded. Oh yeah.

869
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,590
Never point a weapon or anything
you don't intend to destroy.

870
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,300
Oh well we know that now.

871
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,990
I'm just making sure
everybody knows that for sure.

872
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,890
Had some young listeners out there don't
point guns at your hands and pulled the

873
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:27,030
trigger.
Yeah.

874
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,540
That's actually always treat weapons as
if they're loaded and never aim a weapon

875
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:33,930
or anything you don't intend to destroy
period. Those are like the official,

876
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,810
like when you, if you go through like
a gun courses, something like that.

877
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:40,580
Those are, that's the first
thing. Yeah. Interesting.

878
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:44,550
Well you know you went through seal
training so it's a little bit more heavy

879
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:48,990
than a gun course. The basic principles,
gun safety do not change. Yeah,

880
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:52,830
and they should not change.
I wish I would've known that
when I was 12 thank you.

881
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:59,620
I think it's a time for some,

882
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:03,190
some questions from the interwebs.
Yes.

883
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:06,180
Questions from the interwebs.
Speaking of the inner webs,

884
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:10,840
we are in fact supported by on it.com

885
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,700
and if you don't know what
on it.com is or what it is,

886
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:20,730
it's where we get our supplements and
bunch of other supplements that that work.

887
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,450
Not extensive information on there too.
If you want to know

888
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,510
mark, you can also get stuff. Yeah.

889
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:32,270
You can also get like
kettlebells and collect bells,

890
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:35,980
which I have and which I

897
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:04,550
Yeah. Do it. First question,

898
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,280
can you talk about your
training schedules, roles,

899
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:14,000
which is Jujitsu training sessions
we call them. Was that for me or you?

900
01:04:14,001 --> 01:04:17,700
Explain to me what roles is for
everyone. All right. All right.

901
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,210
In the event of them not knowing,
we'd be rolling.

902
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,940
So can you talk about your
training schedules, your roles,

903
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:26,540
and what is a typical week?
What does that look like?

904
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:33,170
Well, for me, you know, I work
out everyday, so what that means,

905
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:37,670
every morning I wake up early
and I get it on. I lift weights,

906
01:04:37,671 --> 01:04:42,080
I do calisthenics, I do some kind of
sprinting evolution seven days a week,

907
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,540
seven days a week.
And,

908
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:49,100
and as I've explained to many
people on the Twitter, they say,

909
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:52,700
don't you ever take a day off? And I
do, but I don't plan to take days off.

910
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:55,640
Days off.
Life brings days off.

911
01:04:56,070 --> 01:05:00,620
You got the broken water heater,
you got the sick kids, you got sick,

912
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:06,020
you got the, the car broke down,
you got the event at school,

913
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,580
whatever it is.
Some,

914
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:11,060
there's some reason there's some
travel plans that don't allow it.

915
01:05:11,061 --> 01:05:13,430
So there's life will give you days off.

916
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,500
So don't take off days voluntarily.
Don't do that.

917
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,850
Let the days off,

918
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:23,851
calm through life and then then you
don't have to freak out about it.

919
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:24,761
And you just go,
oh cool,

920
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:27,100
I've got a day off day to Roscoe
and the travel or on an a,

921
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:31,210
you don't want to miss a workout today,
just going to take it as a day arrest. So,

922
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,040
but I do,
I work out every day.

923
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:38,041
And part of that is going off instinct
of what I feel like of what type of

924
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:43,090
workout I'm going to do.
And, and by that sometimes,

925
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:46,810
I mean I don't feel like doing
a certain kind of workout,

926
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:51,900
therefore I'm going to do it because
it's punishment for being weak.

927
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,010
And then there's times where I'm like,
you know what?

928
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,160
I do not want to do that kind of workout
today because I feel an impending

929
01:05:57,161 --> 01:06:00,850
injury. You're like, Hey, I'm going to
lift real heavy today. No, not today.

930
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:05,740
I'm tight. I'm sore. I'm going to
not do that type of workout today.

931
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:10,950
So it's a little combination
of in instinct and
disciplined versus freedom of,

932
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,180
you know what?
This is going to be too much for me today.

933
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,280
I don't want to lift heavy today,
or I don't feel it.

934
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:21,520
Sometimes I feel like lifting heavy.
Right? You know, in other words,

935
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:22,720
I'm maybe drained,

936
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,720
I'm drained to do some kind
of an endurance type work
workout or a Mac concert.

937
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:30,990
It's going to go in there and
just just do some singles and the,

938
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,830
but then some days you
feel, you know, I'm man,

939
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:35,080
I don't feel like putting any heavy
way up to them to go in there and do

940
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:38,320
something lighter, but maybe higher
repetitions. And that type of things.

941
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:41,320
So I'm doing that every day,
you know,

942
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,930
calisthenics sometimes and doing
a combination of all three.

943
01:06:43,931 --> 01:06:47,860
Sometimes I'm doing one. So that's just
just how I'm getting after it. And again,

944
01:06:47,861 --> 01:06:50,380
I think at some point I'm
going to write an ebook

945
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:55,940
because the publishing process and the
publishing world is a real pain and,

946
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,730
and the ebooks not, and just book an Ebook
is easier. It's easier to do. You do it,

947
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:04,270
you produce it, you just put it through
Amazon. And Amazon just says, Oh cool,

948
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:05,104
you sell them.
We sell.

949
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:08,620
I could sell them for like three
bucks and then anyone could want,

950
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:12,550
some could just get it. And it doesn't
have to be, I don't feel bad if I don't,

951
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,750
you'll, if it's not the, it's something
that I could do the way I wanted to do.

952
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,410
I don't have to, I don't have to like I
don't have to make it a certain length.

953
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:25,420
Oh No, it man, it's three
bucks. You know, it's 28 pages.

954
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,260
That's the information I have is not,
you know, if someone said, Hey Jocko,

955
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:30,940
we want you to write a fitness book,

956
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:35,710
then I've got to be 127 pages and it's
got to have a bunch of things in it that

957
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:40,180
I don't want to talk about because
it's not that complicated. Right?

958
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,980
So 27 pages ebook,
download it,

959
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,660
print it out, everybody can have it
cost. Three bucks. People are stoked.

960
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:50,903
We're all good.

961
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,910
People can stop asking me what my workouts
are like because everybody wants to

962
01:07:54,911 --> 01:07:59,500
know that. I don't know why I'm not, you
know, some incredible athlete, you know,

963
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,090
so here's my workouts. And so that's
what I'm thinking of doing. Um,

964
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:05,890
then again,

965
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:10,390
that's debts I had been thinking about
actually getting someone and saying, hey,

966
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:14,890
you seem like a capable human
helped me write a little ebook.

967
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:17,840
I'm going to tell you what to
put in it and you do it. Why?

968
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:21,320
So it like sounds dope or whatever you
want to know. Just so it gets done.

969
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:26,290
Because right now I'm just busy too busy
for their fitness ebook right now. Yeah.

970
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:27,410
So I got to move that up.

971
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,010
I got to move that up on my chart cause
I know people want to get out that. Okay.

972
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,490
So then on top of the working out,
there's this surfing,

973
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,900
which if there's waves I'm surfing.
Right, right. That's just the way it goes.

974
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:41,210
If there's good ways I'm surfing,
there's not always good waves,

975
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,950
but if there's ways of surfing,

976
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:47,270
one thing I need to do more of is just
go out and paddle. I need to do that.

977
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:49,690
We'll just go out. So you're
constantly in shape cause paddling,

978
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:53,180
paddling a surfboard is different kinds
of conditioning. Anything else? Yeah,

979
01:08:53,181 --> 01:08:56,900
just to be in shape for battling,
Kinda like I've been saying, hey,

980
01:08:56,901 --> 01:08:59,150
if you want to get good
at humping a ruck sack,

981
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,540
then just hump a rucksack that if you
want to get good at doing post two bovis

982
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,910
well if you want to be good at paddling
a surf board, you got a paddle,

983
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:05,720
a surfboard.

984
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,760
So you always feel weak when the big waves
come and you haven't surfed in awhile

985
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:12,890
and you feel weak because you haven't
been paddling. Lack the discipline.

986
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:17,470
So I should be paddling more.
Uh, and then we get to the,

987
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,940
the Jujitsu, the role that
Jujitsu. So our role, if I'm home,

988
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,260
I'm going to the gym and
I'm training, uh, you know,

989
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,180
we usually do some technique.

990
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:33,830
I usually get a little
something from Jeff or from Dean

991
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:38,600
and you know, Dean and Jeff, the,

992
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:43,601
what's crazy is you can always learn
something and it still freaks me out

993
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,420
because it's not like when
I say learn something,

994
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:52,010
I'm not like saying that they're teaching
me some new variation to the Gogo plot

995
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:56,810
yet, right? No, they're teaching,
like dean will say, Hey,

996
01:09:56,811 --> 01:10:00,350
when you put the guillotine on over here,
make this adjustment.

997
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,540
Or when you're passing the guard, do
this here. Like some simple thing.

998
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,930
Or Jeff, remember Jeff
Glover was, I said, Hey Jeff,

999
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:13,700
teach my son though the Darce choke.
And I just watched him give my son,

1000
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,720
you know, like a seven minute class
on the Darce choke. Now, my son,

1001
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,930
you know,
can you imagine you're getting,

1002
01:10:20,931 --> 01:10:25,640
you're nine years old and you're getting
a personal class on the dark joke from

1003
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:28,310
Jeff Glover, but my son, you know,
he just thinks that's normal,

1004
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:29,623
but I'm watching it.

1005
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,280
And I remember Jeff was just going
over a little details and all

1006
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,370
stuff that I did not know
to go relearn in the dark,

1007
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,990
really learning the Darce choke.

1008
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:43,310
And so there's always these little
things and I always am surprised at the

1009
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,970
obviousness of those things and actually
does happen occasionally in the other

1010
01:10:46,971 --> 01:10:48,290
direction.
You know,

1011
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:52,610
dean was going through a slump where
he's really having a hard time passing my

1012
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:56,870
guard and I just said, hey
man, you've been doing,

1013
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,800
why just do x?
And he could see,

1014
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:05,420
I saw on his face because he has a,
a mutant grappling mind,

1015
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:08,120
like I saw on his face as soon as
I told him that it was a thing,

1016
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:12,050
it was a connection made and he instantly
started passing my guard again. Nelson.

1017
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,420
Yeah. Damn. But um, but yeah,

1018
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:18,870
you get these little obvious things,
you get the,

1019
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,290
you get the,
the learning.

1020
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,510
So you're always trying to learn a
little something and then, you know,

1021
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:28,200
there's the situational drills
of going in and then there's,

1022
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:32,720
then there's the reality. Here's the
reality, man. I like to roll. Yeah.

1023
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:37,620
I like to roll. That's the
reality of it. I enjoy training,

1024
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,570
not starting, not starting in one position
and going into, no, I like to train.

1025
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:44,430
That's what I like to do.
That's what I love about Jujitsu.

1026
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,330
So I like to roll and I
roll and whenever I go in,

1027
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:53,250
my goal is to role and
the same way that I will,

1028
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,540
some nights I go in, like there was
some days I go in or nights and,

1029
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:01,500
and you know, normal night, I just feel
like we're all on slack going in rural.

1030
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,640
Some days I'm like, you know what
man, I'm not feeling it today

1031
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,150
and because I'm not feeling it today,

1032
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:13,740
I'm going to get it on and
I'll force myself. That Kinda,

1033
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,810
that's Kinda like when
you're a kid and um,

1034
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,340
you start crying or something
and you dead tells you a,

1035
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:23,100
I'll give you something to
cry about. Yeah. Like it's
like that. I feel like it, oh,

1036
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:23,881
you don't feel like it.

1037
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:27,960
I'll give you something to not feel
good at or whatever it is that it. And,

1038
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:31,800
and like a couple weeks
ago I said to Mike,

1039
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,710
I got there and I did not feel
like rolling. And I said to myself,

1040
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:39,170
I'm not going to stop until
everybody stops. And so, you
know, the last, you know,

1041
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:42,540
so we start with 20 guys on the mat
and then after three rounds, there's,

1042
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:43,830
you know,

1043
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:48,830
15 guys or 16 guys in the mat and then
a down day 10 and then eight and then

1044
01:12:49,051 --> 01:12:52,020
four. And then it's me and one other
guy. I'm like, it looks like it's,

1045
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:55,200
you got the last round of my friend.
But I just did that to myself.

1046
01:12:55,201 --> 01:12:58,920
It's a little form of, it's a little
form of exercising a little discipline.

1047
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,640
But that being said,
there's days where I go in and,

1048
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:05,130
and I don't feel it and I don't feel
it as a different sense that I have,

1049
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,860
which is today's not going
to be a good day today.

1050
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:11,730
I'm going to tweak something today.
I'm too, I'm too worn down or whatever.

1051
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,820
And so I'll go, I'll do, I'll do
some roles and then I'll just,

1052
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:17,700
I'll just leave it at
that. You know, I won't,

1053
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:20,640
I won't force myself to stay on
the map forever. So I do again,

1054
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:23,230
I used that instinct of,

1055
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:28,400
of what I am feeling to make a
decision on how it's going to go down.

1056
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:33,560
That's fine. One day,
um, Greg, he randomly,

1057
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,820
I came in, he was like, yeah,

1058
01:13:34,821 --> 01:13:38,480
I feel like I just feel like I'm
going to break my toe today. Yeah.

1059
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:41,480
It sounds weird, right? He said, yeah,
I feel like it. And I was like, Oh yeah,

1060
01:13:41,481 --> 01:13:43,730
you just feel that. He was
like, yeah, I just feel like it

1061
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:50,930
that day I broke my toe.
I didn't really break it.

1062
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:53,780
It was like kind of dislocated or
something like that. But it's weird.

1063
01:13:53,781 --> 01:13:57,410
That's weird, right? I know way
different point, but still. Um,

1064
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:03,350
so my workouts, I'll go through it
real fast. Different than yours.

1065
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:07,310
I work out average five days a week,
but

1066
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:13,270
they're not everything all in one.
So I'll, if I roll three days,

1067
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:18,220
I'll lift. And do metcons and cardio
and that kind of stuff. Two days.

1068
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,810
Really? Yeah. So, so I don't do like what
do you do with all your free time man?

1069
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:28,270
Make videos. That's right. Hang
with them. I am. So you really,

1070
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:32,560
how many times a week do you
train? Three. Three, sometimes two.

1071
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:37,000
Unless I'm like super busy
then one dang. Yeah. But yeah,

1072
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:40,630
back when I was competing I was
doing six and now it's like two days,

1073
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:43,090
not two days train. But
I'll do running, lifting,

1074
01:14:43,091 --> 01:14:48,091
conditioning and then a different
session I do Jujitsu and whatever that

1075
01:14:48,431 --> 01:14:52,660
entails. Um, same thing as you, you know,
do some technique, but I'll typically,

1076
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,620
hey, how many rounds do you
feel like on a typical day,

1077
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,540
you know how you'll do some technique,

1078
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:01,690
little book class or training session
even you'll do some technique,

1079
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:07,210
maybe some drills, six and then rounds,
right? So you'd do six rounds that solid,

1080
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:11,060
what, five minutes? Six, six
or six, six minute rounds.
You know, it's kind of like,

1081
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,800
it's, yeah, it's strange because
that's one time we did like a,

1082
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:18,460
we had the gym was closed but
we had, you know, an open mat,

1083
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:22,350
but it wasn't an open mat.
It was like, hey, we're going
to train. And we did wait,

1084
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,540
we who just won a bunch of handful.
You guys, you were probably there.

1085
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:30,520
I don't know. I don't
remember. But we did six,

1086
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:34,210
six minute rounds,
no gooey and then six,

1087
01:15:34,211 --> 01:15:38,170
six minute rounds where you there
that day? I usually don't get tired.

1088
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:43,600
I got tired that day. Well, I got tired
that day. Yeah. The, how's it? Okay. So I,

1089
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:47,110
I'd go to, I haven't been taught
to us in a few months now, but um,

1090
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,130
I'd go there like when they
are trained for ADCC and um,

1091
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,770
I go there once a week,
once every two weeks just for one.

1092
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:58,690
And so they do stuff like in
every single time I've been there,

1093
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:03,691
it's been one of these things tend to
six tens six rounds of 10 minutes each,

1094
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,370
30 seconds in between one and then
one minute between the next one,

1095
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:10,204
you know it goes through

1096
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:16,150
or five 10 minute rounds.
Oh No.

1097
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:18,820
For 10 minute minute rounds
and then one 20 minute route.

1098
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:23,230
Those you get tired. Yeah, sure.

1099
01:16:23,231 --> 01:16:26,080
I have a conditioning because
when we do 20 like when I'm,

1100
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,520
when Dean's getting ready for an ECC or
whoever we got that's doing the longer

1101
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:34,840
or the no time limit matches and
I'm doing 20 his 20 minute rounds,

1102
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:39,710
I'm just good to go in.
Yeah. I surprisingly handled
what I was in. Good shape,

1103
01:16:39,711 --> 01:16:40,360
man did it.

1104
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:44,230
But I think it has to do with what we
talked about the other day where I'm not a

1105
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:47,530
really fast sprinter. Right, right.
I'm not a really fast runner,

1106
01:16:47,531 --> 01:16:50,010
but if you put a ruck sack on me,
I can go for a long time. Right.

1107
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,560
And I think it's one of those like I can
grapple for a long time not get tired.

1108
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,670
Yeah. I think mine's psychological
where if I know it's 20 minutes,

1109
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:03,040
then I'm not, I don't feel
like, I dunno, confined or,

1110
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:05,790
I don't know. I feel like the
hardest thing that we do is early.

1111
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:08,690
It was like when we shark tank, each
other, you know, is when you're putting,

1112
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:11,000
you know, I'll be in the or one
of our guys that's competing.

1113
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,390
We'll go in the middle and you're
getting a fresh guy every two minutes,

1114
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:16,880
one minute, three minutes, five
minutes, whatever the case may be.

1115
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:20,120
You're getting somebody fresh
on you and that's where you get,

1116
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:23,420
that's where you get tested.
Yeah. I would say a typical class,

1117
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:26,690
so it's like anywhere from a five
minute round, six minute round,

1118
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:32,570
either five or six minutes,
three, four or four routes.

1119
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:36,750
I'd say that's a typical, you know, not
a training for a competition. Just to,

1120
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,940
you know, this is what we're doing. If you
go four, five, six rounds, that's like,

1121
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:45,500
that's kind of a lot around compared
to just the average I think in my

1122
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:49,280
experience. Yeah. I let I start. I feel
like I got, I got good training yet.

1123
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:52,520
Like six, six veterans. That's where
I feel good. Yeah, that's 36,000.

1124
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:56,180
It's almost 40, 40 something minutes and
training. That makes me feel good. Yeah,

1125
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:58,580
man. Yeah, that's a lot.
That's a lot though. You know,

1126
01:17:58,581 --> 01:18:01,800
you'll see guys dropping off after
three rounds out, say not everybody,

1127
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:05,350
obviously it has to do with
who you're training. Like Yay.

1128
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,870
I can train with somebody that's
not that good all day long,

1129
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:13,820
but you can start getting the grinders on.
You gotta be ready.

1130
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,410
We did. I just, Oh,

1131
01:18:15,411 --> 01:18:20,411
and I've trained with Andy won round
one and it's like literally like three

1132
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:23,630
rounds with, within like an average
normal person on your level.

1133
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:29,030
Pace in the string.
What's cool about Andy was Andy is,

1134
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:33,140
he's probably my main training partner
now. I treat them all the time.

1135
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:37,970
Uh, but for a while he didn't work out at
all. He didn't like lift her knee, right?

1136
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,720
Yeah. Back in the day. And then I said,
hey man, you got to get to the next level.

1137
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,610
I hate to say it,
you got to do some working out.

1138
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:47,060
And he's an athletic guy
anyways. And I just said, hey,

1139
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:49,640
go do a bunch of pull ups and then the
next day do bunch of pushups and dips and

1140
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,850
the next day do some squats.
And he's okay.

1141
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,550
He started doing it and in a month,
man,

1142
01:18:55,551 --> 01:18:58,940
he was a different dude and now we
started powerlifting. So he's even,

1143
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,270
he's even morphing a little bit more,
but he's won some big,

1144
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,330
he's won some big tournaments. He's
got some game for sure. He did good.

1145
01:19:05,331 --> 01:19:09,940
And the in the Challenges League minimum
is challenging like second or something

1146
01:19:09,941 --> 01:19:13,210
like that. Yeah. Good. He's great training
partner. Yeah. It's funny. He was, um,

1147
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:16,700
I noticed that where he was
always athletic and stuff
and then one time I ain't

1148
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:21,380
seen him for that long, but like we
don't take him off and say, Hey, what,

1149
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:24,500
you know, what did you do? Cause you look
way different right now. And he was like,

1150
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:28,890
oh, I just changed my eating.
I don't eat like a whole, uh,

1151
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:33,820
containers of Nutella anymore.
Okay. Gotcha. But yeah,

1152
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:39,230
I don't know. But yeah, that's
it. Next question. Let's do it.

1153
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:44,420
Can you please share on your podcasts
what the difference between lazy

1154
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:49,290
delegation and decentralization is?
Okay,

1155
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:51,910
so decentralized command is obviously the,
uh,

1156
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,550
one of the principals combat where
you have in the book that we wrote,

1157
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,740
and I have a very simple definition
that I've been explaining to people.

1158
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:05,300
Decentralized command, it's
everybody leads. That's what
decentralized command is.

1159
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,250
Uh, and, and obviously

1160
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:12,240
that means you want
everybody else to lead.

1161
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:16,500
And so this question is what's different
gene being lazy and just delegating

1162
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:19,710
everything and what's
good decentralization.

1163
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:25,130
So Leesie delegation number
one is delegating things
that are actually your job,

1164
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,700
right? Cause there's, there's some roles
and responsibilities that people have.

1165
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,830
And if you take something that is supposed
to be your job right and you delegate

1166
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:39,050
it to somebody else because you don't
feel like doing it, then that's lazy. If,

1167
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,043
as a matter of fact,

1168
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:45,110
if you're delegating something that
it's something that you're delegating

1169
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:49,710
because you don't want to do it,
then,

1170
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:54,280
then that's being lazy,
right?

1171
01:20:54,281 --> 01:20:57,340
If you're actually delegating something
because it's something you don't want to

1172
01:20:57,341 --> 01:21:02,050
do, right, then you're being lazy. And,

1173
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,940
and I'll tell you,

1174
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:08,150
it's actually a mindset to take on the
tasks of the things that you don't want

1175
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:13,530
to do or that your team
doesn't want to do.

1176
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,850
So this is like literally do elders.

1177
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,470
There's something that is hard to do or
that no one wants to do, do that thing.

1178
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,000
And I'll give you an example.
We had to,

1179
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:27,630
we had to stand watch in Iraq
on my first deployment to Iraq,

1180
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:31,380
we had to stand watch on the prisoners
that we would capture. It's, we come back,

1181
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:32,310
we have to stand watch on him.

1182
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,500
So I made myself and my
assistant platoon commander,

1183
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:40,140
I was a platoon commander
at the time I gave us.

1184
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:43,410
I assigned us the worst
watch of the night,

1185
01:21:43,411 --> 01:21:47,280
like the zero 300 in the morning
until zero 500 in the morning.

1186
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,160
The watch that nobody wants because it's
in the middle of your sleep pattern.

1187
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:54,840
No one wanted that watch. I put us on
that watch. We took the worst watch.

1188
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,650
So I didn't delegate the hard watch.
I took the hard watch.

1189
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,680
So there's an example of
the opposite of being lazy.

1190
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:04,380
You're taking on board the hard tasks,
you know,

1191
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,240
another one is when we would go
shooting and we'd get done shooting.

1192
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:11,790
And believe it or not, even the seal
teams, you got to go pick up brass.

1193
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:14,640
You got to go pick up brass off
the ground, all over the desert,

1194
01:22:14,641 --> 01:22:17,010
all over the field, all over,
wherever you did a bunch of shooting.

1195
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:21,960
And it's pretty easy for the guy that's
in charge to have a meeting to attend to

1196
01:22:21,961 --> 01:22:24,760
when it's time to pick up brass. But I
would always pick up brass, you know,

1197
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:28,300
I wouldn't delegate Shell, the shell, the
shell casings, but it's a pain. You know,

1198
01:22:28,301 --> 01:22:29,520
it literally,
yet when you're at,

1199
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:33,570
at land warfare it takes a
couple days to pick up brass.

1200
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,720
And instead of like I said, instead
of having to go back for a meeting,

1201
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:41,310
I'd go out there and you know,
jump in there and have the crap job.

1202
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:44,910
Like everybody else, I'm picking up brass.
So I wouldn't delegate these things.

1203
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:48,890
That's being lazy when you
delegate that. Uh, and,

1204
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:52,310
and another thing I'll find is if
somebody's complaining of some,

1205
01:22:52,311 --> 01:22:55,980
if one of my subordinates is complaining
to me about having to do something,

1206
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:57,310
okay,

1207
01:22:57,310 --> 01:23:02,170
I automatically take it and I say, Oh,
oh, echo, it's a pain for you to do this.

1208
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,460
Cool.
What I'll do it.

1209
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:08,650
And it has a good psychological
effect on, right? I mean it's, it's,

1210
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:12,550
it's each showing them that like,
look man,

1211
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:15,430
I'm here for you and if it's
too much for you, I'll take it.

1212
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:20,470
And I've had people literally
going under, no, I got,

1213
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,710
cause that's the instinct that people
have. They go, look man, I got it.

1214
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:28,360
And that's what I would do if I complained
about something. And then I said,

1215
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,910
and then my boss said to me, you
know what, if it's too much for you,

1216
01:23:30,911 --> 01:23:35,650
I'll take care of it. You're
like, no, no, no, no. So,

1217
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,090
and that's awesome.
I'll tell you,

1218
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:39,250
there was also a little
form of discipline in there,

1219
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:43,090
a little form of discipline of taking
on board tasks and doing things that you

1220
01:23:43,091 --> 01:23:44,140
know you don't want to do.

1221
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:49,530
That's a way of exercising some
discipline in your life and making things

1222
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:54,640
happen. So that's the kind of thing. All
those things, that's like lazy delegation.

1223
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,360
If you're doing those kinds of things
where you're getting rid of jobs you don't

1224
01:23:58,361 --> 01:23:58,691
want,

1225
01:23:58,691 --> 01:24:03,691
you're getting rid of jobs that you should
be doing and getting rid of jobs that

1226
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:10,330
are a pain or are monotonous,
or you think they're below you.

1227
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:16,360
So the opposite of that is
decentralized command, right?

1228
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:19,750
This is where you're letting other
people do what they're supposed to do.

1229
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:24,050
It's when you're letting people do
things that will help them grow. Hmm.

1230
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:26,770
Does it help a person
grow by picking up brass?

1231
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:28,270
I suppose there's a little
character building and there,

1232
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:29,800
but it's not going to
literally help them grow.

1233
01:24:29,801 --> 01:24:31,960
So you don't need to delegate that task.

1234
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,280
Does it help someone grow as a leader
to do the zero 300 zero 500 watch on

1235
01:24:36,281 --> 01:24:41,080
prisoners know it's pain. It's
just, it's just unmitigated pain.

1236
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:44,920
So it doesn't help people
grow so that that then,

1237
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:47,290
then you don't have to decentralize that.

1238
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,930
But if you've got something that's gonna
let somebody grow, you, let them do it.

1239
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:55,830
If there's something that allows you to
stand back and be the tactical genius,

1240
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:01,180
and we wrote about this in
the book, you know, then,

1241
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:06,940
and thereby allowing me to have a
different perspective on something,

1242
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,990
then I should absolutely decentralized
and delegated. So if, if,

1243
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:13,420
if there was a mission came up and
we need to come up with a plan,

1244
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,010
I would tell you to plan it.
I'd be like Echo,

1245
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:17,890
you come up with a plan on this and then
you'd go and plant it and you'd be all

1246
01:25:17,891 --> 01:25:21,880
involved in it and you would lose
the elevation that I would have.

1247
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:24,700
So when I come back to look at your plan,
you say, here's the plan. I go, hey,

1248
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:26,830
it looks good except for these two
points. And you'd be like, man,

1249
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:29,650
how did he see those points?
I'd say it's because I had the altitude.

1250
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:33,790
So that's another time
that decentralized command,

1251
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:38,820
it's a very helpful decentralized
command means letting people make little

1252
01:25:38,861 --> 01:25:42,700
mistakes and not punishing
them because of those mistakes.

1253
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,660
That's decentralized command.
If I

1254
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,360
just hammer people and punish them when
they make a mistake because they're not

1255
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:53,021
going to wanting to take any,

1256
01:25:53,021 --> 01:25:55,170
chances are they're not going to want to
take any risk and they're not going to

1257
01:25:55,171 --> 01:25:59,830
want to lead because I've been punitive
with my actions towards them. Now,

1258
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:02,950
that doesn't mean,
and I've seen this happen.

1259
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:06,320
That doesn't mean if I'm going to let
you go play on a mission and I see you're

1260
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:10,640
screwing it up, I'm just going to let you
have a catastrophic failure, right? No,

1261
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:13,120
I'm going to be like, Hey, echo,
think about this over here. Hey, echo,

1262
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,230
think about that over there.
We're going to get you dialed in.

1263
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:18,890
I'm going to let give you some rope, but
I'm not going to let you hang yourself.

1264
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:24,260
I'm actually going to give you enough
rope to get the job done and think on your

1265
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:26,300
own. But if you start looking like
you're going to hang yourself,

1266
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:27,200
I'm going to stop you.

1267
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:32,480
The other thing about decentralized
command that's positive,

1268
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:36,650
that's not just lazy delegation is when
you let your subordinate lead so that

1269
01:26:36,651 --> 01:26:40,340
you can focus upward,
outward and forward.

1270
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:44,480
So if,
if you have a mission,

1271
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:47,120
if we have a mission to accomplish
and I tell you to lead it,

1272
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,020
that means you can take care of
that mission. I can look upward,

1273
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,960
meaning up the chain of command,
find out what's going on on outward,

1274
01:26:53,961 --> 01:26:56,300
meaning what's the enemy
doing and forward meeting.

1275
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:59,750
What's going to happen in the future.
And if I'm wrapped up in the,

1276
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:03,800
in the accomplishing of the task
at hand from a leadership position,

1277
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:07,040
I can't do any of those things. I can't
look out for it. I can't look out.

1278
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:08,320
We're like, can't look forward. Hmm.

1279
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:13,970
You gotta let people lead so
that they can become leaders.

1280
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:18,960
And your actual goal, and this is
where people get intimidated, is too,

1281
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,860
to set them up so they can take your job.
That's what you want.

1282
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:26,000
You want them to be able to take your
job right. And people get scared of that,

1283
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,490
but you can't be scared of
that. Yeah. What was that?

1284
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:33,050
There was a quote where where one guy was
asking the other guy or something like,

1285
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:34,850
Hey, what happens if we develop, you know,

1286
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:37,310
our workers and then they
leave us and he's like,

1287
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:42,270
it's better than not developing on
and having them stay. Yeah, yeah,

1288
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:46,910
yeah. That's a good point. I
mean that's me doing a quote.

1289
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:50,120
Okay. You know what I'm saying?
No, that's, that's good.

1290
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:52,490
And you definitely want
to set your people up.

1291
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:54,290
Do you want to work yourself out of a job?

1292
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:58,490
And then you've got your
other opportunities will
come because people will see

1293
01:27:58,491 --> 01:27:59,420
that you develop a team,

1294
01:27:59,421 --> 01:28:01,550
people to see that you develop good
leaders and they're going to say, hey,

1295
01:28:01,551 --> 01:28:03,950
I want you to come and do that at this
higher position and you're going to get

1296
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:08,600
benefit from that as well. Well, Echo,

1297
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:12,080
can you ask Jocko to talk more
about the writing process?

1298
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,690
Any ups and downs,
obstacles,

1299
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:20,140
daily rituals and or future plans.
Uh,

1300
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:24,130
so I know I've asked answered
this question before. Mm hmm.

1301
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,910
It's very all answered again. I'm
going to do it quickly. What were my,

1302
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:33,320
what did I do when writing? I wrote a
thousand words a day no matter what.

1303
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:37,760
If I had some obstacles as
the question had said here,

1304
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:41,840
I would write if I had ups and downs,
I would write, if I had a daily ritual,

1305
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:44,930
it was to write every day.
That's what I did.

1306
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,960
I wrote a thousand words a day and when
you're writing a 50,000 or 60,000 word

1307
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:52,370
manuscript,
that means in two months you've got your,

1308
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,660
you got your manuscript done.

1309
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:59,030
The thing about writing every day,
and I've said this before,

1310
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,410
is if you write every day,

1311
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:04,890
you don't need to rehash what you
wrote before because you remember it.

1312
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:07,050
So you can just open the book
or you can open your page.

1313
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:10,260
You can open the document that you
can just start writing. And even,

1314
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,670
I used to like kind of lead my,

1315
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,850
leave myself a lead sentence
that I knew would just,

1316
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:18,900
I could sit down the next day and start
flowing right into it. So do that.

1317
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,790
And also I had the outline, I mean for
extreme ownership that Leif and I wrote,

1318
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:26,130
I had the outline,
we had the chapters,

1319
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,660
so I broadly knew what I was writing
about and then it's just a matter of

1320
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,730
sitting down and making it happen.
And when I went to college,

1321
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:36,180
I was an English major in college, and
guess what? I sat down and wrote when it,

1322
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,300
when I had to write papers,
when I had to write scripts,

1323
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:43,410
when I had to write whatever
I had to write, I just sat
down and started writing.

1324
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,530
And then it's the same thing when
I was in the navy. The navy, right.

1325
01:29:46,531 --> 01:29:51,000
All kinds of stuff. You write evaluations,
you right, operational summaries.

1326
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:55,020
You write a wards,
you write all kinds of things in the navy,

1327
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:58,530
and I used to just sit down and it's
right. That's what you got to do.

1328
01:29:58,531 --> 01:29:59,490
You just got to get on it.

1329
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,690
And one thing about me
is my rough draft might,

1330
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:06,630
when I'm sitting down I just start
writing. It's, I know it's going to be

1331
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:12,090
rough. It's going to be a rough, rough
draft. That's what I'm going to write.

1332
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:14,670
You just go, just go. And I don't care.

1333
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:18,330
And an misspelling stuff
and a punctuations bad, but
I don't care about that.

1334
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:21,660
I'm going to get a stop it because it's
so easy to clean that stuff up later.

1335
01:30:21,661 --> 01:30:23,100
The hard part is getting the,

1336
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:28,590
the f the foundational information down
on the paper. That's the hard part.

1337
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,053
Um,

1338
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:34,260
and it's easy for me to
edit it or hone it later.

1339
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:39,180
Now as far as future plans,
future books, uh, yeah,

1340
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:42,540
I mean Lafe and I are
definitely doing a follow up,

1341
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:47,940
a book about leadership and
we're working on that right now.

1342
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:49,823
So that's a common,

1343
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:54,780
I noticed that your text
messages are always grammatically

1344
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:59,070
correct. Yeah. I was a,

1345
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,010
I was an English major and I took classes,

1346
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:06,570
I took classes like advanced
grammar and syntax. Yeah.

1347
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:11,370
And uh, yeah, so I, it actually,

1348
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:16,470
I find language and linguistics
to be very interesting.

1349
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:21,480
Yeah. And I know that, uh,
Mike stro strikes some people
as weird, but I really do.

1350
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:26,040
I find linguistics and language and
the written word and the way words are

1351
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:30,570
combined together to make
thoughts in people's brains.

1352
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:34,680
It's a very interesting
process to me and so I was, uh,

1353
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:38,190
I was very interested in it and
that's another reason why I,

1354
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:42,540
why I studied English when
I was in college. It's the,

1355
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:48,090
it's the written word, the
written word, which is a very,

1356
01:31:48,091 --> 01:31:53,070
very powerful, very, very powerful tool.

1357
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:59,750
I also noticed your over youth of
capital letters in your text messages.

1358
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:02,680
Oh,
maybe that's just how you're feeling.

1359
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:07,681
Sometimes that's only when I'm
texting you certain things.

1360
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,840
Next question,
like I'll see you on the map.

1361
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:20,400
Next question.

1362
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:28,770
Is Detachment something you do in real
time or is it before or after any event?

1363
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:33,340
I think I've heard you describe both.
Is it both?

1364
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:41,250
No, it is not. Both. It is not both.
Actually, if you think about it. Okay.

1365
01:32:41,251 --> 01:32:43,470
The detachment that we're talking
about is when you get involved in these

1366
01:32:43,471 --> 01:32:43,981
situations,

1367
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:46,380
you got to detach yourself from it so
that you can make good decisions so that

1368
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:48,780
you can see things clearly so that
you can assess things clearly.

1369
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,000
That's why you detach
from these situations.

1370
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:56,210
So technically if before
or after an event,

1371
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:00,630
you are detached from them, right? Because
they're not happening at that time.

1372
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:05,930
Now I guess you could be so emotional
about an event that even after it happens,

1373
01:33:06,961 --> 01:33:09,810
you could still not see it clearly
because you can't detach from it.

1374
01:33:09,811 --> 01:33:13,440
So I guess I could give it to you that,
okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

1375
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,820
And real for it.

1376
01:33:14,821 --> 01:33:19,821
You could be so amped up about it and so
nervous about it and so emotional about

1377
01:33:20,311 --> 01:33:23,520
it that I guess beforehand you could.
So I guess, I guess I am wrong,

1378
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:28,530
I am talking about detaching
throughout the process, right?

1379
01:33:28,531 --> 01:33:31,680
But even if you're,
if you have to detach beforehand,

1380
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:34,800
you're not detaching on
the incoming situation.

1381
01:33:34,801 --> 01:33:38,920
You'd have to detach from your current
yes. Being nervous about the uncovered.

1382
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,390
Right. And that may help you prep it
all. I'll talk about that a little bit,

1383
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:47,391
but the skill itself is being
able to detach during the event.

1384
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:54,150
And I'll tell you, once you do detach
from it, it's actually pretty easy.

1385
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:59,450
But to punch through that gravity that
your brain makes with emotion and chaos

1386
01:34:01,351 --> 01:34:03,450
and mayhem.
That's the hard part.

1387
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:08,310
The hard part is to notice that you're
stuck in the gravitational pull of all

1388
01:34:08,311 --> 01:34:11,840
that emotion.
So you got to pay attention to that end.

1389
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,260
What you really want to try and do is try,
and it's what you just said,

1390
01:34:16,261 --> 01:34:21,140
try and detach yourself
before the gravity and the uh,

1391
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:24,330
the gravity of the emotions
and the chaos builds up.

1392
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:28,140
If you can detach before that,
then you'd have to break through it.

1393
01:34:28,141 --> 01:34:32,290
You're already outside that
realm and so then it's, it's,

1394
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:33,360
it's much easier.

1395
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:38,280
So it's like there's quick sand in front
of you and it's much easier to just see

1396
01:34:38,281 --> 01:34:39,900
the quick stand and just say,

1397
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,810
I'm not going to step in there
than it is to walk in there,

1398
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:47,100
go up into your waist and start feeling
getting sucked down and then decide, oh,

1399
01:34:47,101 --> 01:34:51,300
I'm going to pull myself out of
that. It's a lot harder. Yeah. So

1400
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:56,610
you got to look for those signs.
You got to look for that moment.

1401
01:34:56,611 --> 01:34:59,240
When you start feeling emotional or you
know that it's going to be something

1402
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:02,420
emotionally,
you got to step back from those and get,

1403
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,200
get yourself in the
habit of asking yourself,

1404
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:11,420
what do I look like right now?
What does Jocko look like right now?

1405
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,690
What does Jocko sound like right now?

1406
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:18,200
Listen to yourself talk.

1407
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:23,330
Listen to the words that are coming out
of your mouth and see if you're being a

1408
01:35:23,331 --> 01:35:25,880
reasonable human or not.

1409
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:31,670
And I'll tell you one thing that I,
I do,

1410
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:36,980
I kind of see is, you know,
when I'm in the movie,

1411
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:41,780
the Terminator, when he sees like the,
the various responses he could give. Well,

1412
01:35:41,781 --> 01:35:42,351
when I'm feeling,

1413
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:46,550
when I'm really good in a very detached
mode and I'm having a conversation with

1414
01:35:46,551 --> 01:35:51,490
someone, I like see the options in my
head of what I could say to him and I,

1415
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:54,350
Oh yeah, that'll make them mad. Oh
yeah, that's too authentic. Okay,

1416
01:35:54,351 --> 01:35:56,690
that lots of good one. Hey
Buddy, blah blah, blah, blah.

1417
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:02,020
So I think that that mindset
kind of works pretty good.

1418
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,510
But again,
look for the signs.

1419
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:10,511
Look for the quick sand look for the
emotional quicksand and don't step in it.

1420
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:13,520
The emotion of the anger,
the frustration.

1421
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:18,620
There's little physical signs too. When
you start feeling the sweat beading up,

1422
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:22,310
when you start feeling hot,
like you literally start feeling hot.

1423
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:27,590
That should be a big red flag. Yeah. That
warmth that flushes through your face,

1424
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:32,150
that's not good. Yeah. The breathing,

1425
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:35,570
when you start getting,
when you're breathing starts increasing,

1426
01:36:35,571 --> 01:36:38,600
your pulse was going. That's the stuff.
You got a notice to say yourself. Oh,

1427
01:36:38,601 --> 01:36:41,120
there it is.
There it is.

1428
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:46,070
That's the quicksand of emotion
and confusion and chaos.

1429
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:51,290
You don't want to step into it. You want
to pull yourself back. We'll take away.

1430
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:55,610
There is like be like the terminator. No,
I'm not saying be like the terminator.

1431
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:56,843
That was a,

1432
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:02,380
that was a comparison of thinking of
being able to visualize the options that

1433
01:37:04,551 --> 01:37:06,080
you have and if you're emotional,

1434
01:37:06,081 --> 01:37:08,840
you don't think like that when
you're emotional, you're just,

1435
01:37:08,841 --> 01:37:11,480
you're just blurting out whenever
he's going to come out of your mouth,

1436
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,330
but when you're detached a little
bit, you okay. I could say this.

1437
01:37:14,331 --> 01:37:17,360
I could say that, oh, this is
answered three and we say it.

1438
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:19,520
It's like a problem solving tactic.

1439
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:25,410
It's interesting because on the
terminator he blurted out analytically,

1440
01:37:25,551 --> 01:37:28,820
he blurted out an emotional response
because he was acting like a person.

1441
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,230
You remember that?
You remember what he said?

1442
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:33,250
I don't to profanity when he's
in the thing he's looking at,

1443
01:37:33,251 --> 01:37:38,251
he's all shot up and the superintendent
or whatever the whatever it's knocking

1444
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:42,460
on the motel door. Okay. Hey Buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

1445
01:37:42,461 --> 01:37:43,940
Cause all these flashes riding off.

1446
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:46,700
So he looked through his responses and
they're pretty funny. If you read them,

1447
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:50,270
I forget exactly what they are, but he
goes the like, the one he chose was,

1448
01:37:50,271 --> 01:37:53,650
fuck you asshole. That was it.
Instead of, well, you know. Yeah,

1449
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:58,980
I do remember that. Yeah. That was pretty
dope. The fake emotions, which sometimes,

1450
01:37:58,981 --> 01:38:01,920
which I've talked about before, sometimes
you got to use the fake emotions.

1451
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:06,840
This switcheroo. Yeah. Or is that what's
good for the goose is good for the no,

1452
01:38:06,841 --> 01:38:09,180
it's like when your kid is not getting,

1453
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,270
you're not listening
to what you're saying.

1454
01:38:12,271 --> 01:38:14,130
You're not having the impact
that you want to house.

1455
01:38:14,131 --> 01:38:16,980
You got to show a little bit of anger,
turned up the heat.

1456
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:19,960
That's kind of good too. And
don't get crazy with it. Right.

1457
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:22,320
As far as with the kids
where if you show anger,

1458
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:25,830
not only is it like a powerful thing and
they're like, oh shoot, this is powerful.

1459
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:29,580
It demonstrates to them that you care
about what what we're talking about right

1460
01:38:29,581 --> 01:38:34,050
now. I care about it rather than, you
know, rather than I'm just a machine.

1461
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,540
A robot. Yeah. Yeah. I don't care.

1462
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:38,850
But I know I'm supposed to
tell you this kind of feeling.

1463
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,120
Next question,

1464
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:46,920
how do you deal with being evaluated
specifically by different people with

1465
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:50,280
different, a PD since and motive. Oh,

1466
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:55,500
how do you deal with being evaluated?
Well,

1467
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,480
I can tell you right now,

1468
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:04,290
nobody likes being
evaluated, right? Nobody. Mm.

1469
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,490
Now you might get somebody that
says, oh, I love being coached and,

1470
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:09,910
and there are some people that
are pretty positive about that.

1471
01:39:09,911 --> 01:39:12,970
And as a matter of fact, I have clients
where they want to be coached. Right.

1472
01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:18,480
But most people, especially in a normal
environment, like if you go out new hires,

1473
01:39:18,481 --> 01:39:19,810
someone to coach you.
Okay,

1474
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:21,720
okay.

1475
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,990
But most people in a normal environment,

1476
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:29,670
they don't like being evaluated.
They don't like being judged,

1477
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:31,620
always judging.

1478
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:37,550
So the first thing you have to do when
it comes to being evaluated is get that

1479
01:39:37,631 --> 01:39:39,670
in your head that you like.

1480
01:39:39,671 --> 01:39:43,780
Everybody else has defense mechanisms
and they're going to flare up.

1481
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:48,370
As soon as somebody says
something critical of you have,

1482
01:39:48,371 --> 01:39:50,590
soon as somebody goes to evaluate you,

1483
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,670
your defense mechanisms are going to
go up. And then once that happens,

1484
01:39:54,671 --> 01:39:59,200
once you feel those defense mechanisms
go up, you got to put your ego in check.

1485
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:00,323
Hm Hm.

1486
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:04,890
You got to put your ego in check.

1487
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:09,380
And then once you do that,
you got to listen, Liz.

1488
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:14,090
I know it sounds crazy. Listen to
what they're saying. Don't even,

1489
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:17,840
don't even think of a response.
Say to yourself, you know what?

1490
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:21,920
I'm not even going to respond. I'm only
going to listen to what they're saying.

1491
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:26,030
Yeah. But, and, and to kind of, you
already can't even take it. No, no,

1492
01:40:26,031 --> 01:40:27,560
I can't take it. Oh, I'm saying,

1493
01:40:27,561 --> 01:40:31,010
but I think because people will
will quote unquote do that,

1494
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:33,680
but they won't really do it. As
far as, I'm not gonna say anything.

1495
01:40:33,681 --> 01:40:36,840
I'm just going to listen. Yeah,
that's actually, that's actually,

1496
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,710
that's actually how they set it up to
look. I'm not going to say anything.

1497
01:40:39,711 --> 01:40:42,360
I'm just going to listen. Yes, exactly.
What I'm talking about is like you don't,

1498
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:46,100
or they'll all body language,
you know the kind where they're like,

1499
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:51,560
you know, they'll do that kind of
stuff. Don't do that. We'll not do that.

1500
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:55,390
So you're right. You got to, and
not just listen, but truly listen,

1501
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:56,950
not listen just with your ears,

1502
01:40:56,951 --> 01:41:01,120
but listening with your mind and
your brain and with an open mind,

1503
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,740
an open mind,

1504
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:07,030
and then think about what people are
saying and then see it is important.

1505
01:41:07,031 --> 01:41:11,290
See it from their perspective. Because
if you just see it from your perspective,

1506
01:41:11,291 --> 01:41:13,720
you're not even seeing what
the criticism really is.

1507
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:17,500
You're only seeing the
defense of the criticism.

1508
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:20,140
So actually get in their mind and say,
wow,

1509
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,990
what does this look like
from their perspective?

1510
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,510
Why would they be taking the effort?

1511
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:30,340
And the risk and the challenge of trying
to present this problem to me if it

1512
01:41:30,341 --> 01:41:34,990
wasn't important or are they just
doing it just to make me mad? No,

1513
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:40,270
they're trying to help you. And you
know what just like, just like a joke,

1514
01:41:40,271 --> 01:41:44,200
you know they say like every
joke has some little truth to it.

1515
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:48,490
Every little criticism.
Even if the person is your arch rival,

1516
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:53,970
their criticism is built on something.
Yeah.

1517
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:59,700
So what is that reality that you can take
away from it even though you've got to

1518
01:41:59,771 --> 01:42:02,110
take it with a grain of salt, especially
if the person, like it says here,

1519
01:42:02,111 --> 01:42:04,360
if the person has different
opinions and mode as well.

1520
01:42:04,361 --> 01:42:07,600
Of course they have different opinions.
You want people with different opinions.

1521
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:09,040
Maybe they have different motives.

1522
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:12,940
So maybe you think they're trying to usurp
your authority or something like that.

1523
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:17,740
So you maybe you got to take
it with a grain of salt,

1524
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:22,770
but find the grain of truth in there
too and find what it is from their

1525
01:42:23,801 --> 01:42:27,130
perspective,
what the problem is and learn from it.

1526
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:33,250
And one of the most beautiful things
about this is you take the criticism and

1527
01:42:33,251 --> 01:42:37,870
you make adjustments. You know, how
do I deal with about being evaluated?

1528
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:42,460
I try and accept the evaluation and
make adjustments to improve myself as a

1529
01:42:42,461 --> 01:42:43,294
human.

1530
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:48,040
That's how I deal with being evaluated.

1531
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,970
And I'm not saying I deal with it
anybody better than anybody else because

1532
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:54,850
everybody gets defensive,
myself included.

1533
01:42:56,830 --> 01:43:01,210
You know, we had a little conversation
when we started tonight, right? Sure.

1534
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:06,480
You said I repeated some stuff on the
last podcast allegedly and you know,

1535
01:43:07,871 --> 01:43:12,610
and then we talked through
it and then I said, you know,

1536
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:15,970
and you know, I noticed that your camera
work was a little bit off and you know,

1537
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:19,690
it was just the point. My point was
just approved. How defensive we all get.

1538
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:24,100
We all get, and you know what I did? I
said, you know what? I noticed that too,

1539
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:25,510
you know?
But as far as me repeating,

1540
01:43:25,511 --> 01:43:28,360
there was a couple little sections
and it was because we pull,

1541
01:43:28,361 --> 01:43:33,361
I pulled from multiple different books
and they had a little bit of overlap and

1542
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:38,470
looking back on it probably shouldn't
have. But at the time I thought,

1543
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:42,670
you know what? This is emphasizing
really important points. Yeah.

1544
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:45,790
But still people don't want to hear
the same thing over and over again.

1545
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:47,560
So I probably shouldn't have done that.

1546
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:52,520
So guess what criticism accepted on.
I will adapt,

1547
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:56,750
adjust and I will make improvements to
my game based on your criticism of my

1548
01:43:56,751 --> 01:43:59,000
technique, my skill, and my life.

1549
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:02,990
I didn't accept your criticism about the
camera work. No, you don't. You know,

1550
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:07,640
you don't know anything about my there
it is him up framing it is who are you to

1551
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:12,470
tell me? Yeah, tell echo anything.
Can't tell Leco anything.

1552
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:16,550
Take their criticisms. Fix the
problem. That's what it's all about.

1553
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,470
Your use them to get better.
Next question, Jocko. Echo.

1554
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:25,580
What are your guilty
pleasures other than donuts?

1555
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:30,470
And by the way, I don't even like donuts.
That's pure echo right there. Yeah.

1556
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:34,490
You were talking about yet
a donut delivery it, sorry,
let me finish the question.

1557
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:37,400
What are your guilty pleasures
other than donuts, Jocko?

1558
01:44:37,401 --> 01:44:42,230
What do you do when you momentarily give
in to a vice or something that you know

1559
01:44:42,231 --> 01:44:44,690
is bad for you meant?
I liked it.

1560
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:48,680
I liked the fact that the people that
are asking this is actually two questions

1561
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:53,660
in one. I appreciate the fact
that this person says, Jocko,

1562
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:57,170
what do you do when you
momentarily give into a vice?

1563
01:44:57,530 --> 01:45:02,530
I appreciate that as if I'm this person
that could only for a fraction of a

1564
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:07,040
moment given to any form of
advice because I am not a human,

1565
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:11,690
so I appreciate that.
I appreciate about this two part question.

1566
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:15,320
The first part asks both of us,
specifically Jocko and Echo,

1567
01:45:15,321 --> 01:45:16,610
what are your guilty pleasures?

1568
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:21,910
The second part asks other or the second
part asks Jocko overtly excluding my

1569
01:45:26,001 --> 01:45:30,530
name. Jocko, what do you do when
you momentarily give into a vice?

1570
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:31,340
It's something that you,

1571
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:34,670
and the way I see this is that
you do something about it.

1572
01:45:34,671 --> 01:45:38,410
If you momentarily given me,
if I'm momentarily given like no,

1573
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:40,520
no one want to hear my advice
cause it probably doesn't work.

1574
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:43,460
Oh I thought you were to because
it's just game over at that point.

1575
01:45:43,461 --> 01:45:45,030
It is getting over this one.
Uh,

1576
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:48,720
or you could take it that the fact that
they don't even think you ever break.

1577
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:50,270
Yeah. Yeah. But then again,

1578
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:54,110
you're talking about eating just leaves
Oreo cookies on here. So that's an issue.

1579
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:59,320
Uh, but to get down to it,
what are your guilty pleasures?

1580
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:03,380
I guilty pleasures
number one,

1581
01:46:03,381 --> 01:46:07,640
first and foremost, mint
chocolate chip ice cream, uh,

1582
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:12,800
and especially mint chocolate
chip ice cream milkshakes.

1583
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:18,380
And I do some twisted things in my brain
to kind of convince myself that those

1584
01:46:18,381 --> 01:46:23,381
are actually good for me and that they
contain you just enough carbs and there's

1585
01:46:23,391 --> 01:46:26,870
approaching in there and there's some fat.
It's actually like a full good meal,

1586
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:31,210
which is just a big lie cause it's a
big sugar bomb, like a supplement. So,

1587
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,280
but I do, I do, uh, you know,

1588
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,290
I love mint chocolate chip ice cream.
I really love chocolate milk too.

1589
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:40,773
And,

1590
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:45,780
and there's been these articles floating
around the Internet best posts you can

1591
01:46:47,041 --> 01:46:50,250
get. And it's another
thing, it's like, okay, but

1592
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:55,520
the reality is it sugar
in milk and they had it.

1593
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,080
So again,
I'll,

1594
01:46:58,081 --> 01:47:01,980
I'll twist that one in my
head and sometimes for 10
minutes I'll convince myself

1595
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:04,870
that really that is the
right thing to do. Right. Uh,

1596
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:10,340
obviously we've discussed on here before
those little damn a principal wrapped

1597
01:47:11,221 --> 01:47:15,390
hot dogs that they serve in the airport
that have some kind of butter or

1598
01:47:15,391 --> 01:47:20,310
something on them that just, damn, I
don't know who invented those things,

1599
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:24,420
but God bless him. And then, you
know, you know, the normal crap foods,

1600
01:47:24,421 --> 01:47:28,110
the potato chips, the French fries,
the whatever, the junk. Okay.

1601
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:29,730
So am I,

1602
01:47:29,731 --> 01:47:34,731
he immune to the genetic evolutions that
human beings have been to through that

1603
01:47:37,081 --> 01:47:42,081
make us desire sugary foods and the
endorphins going off and firing your head?

1604
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:47,370
No, I'm not immune to those things when I,

1605
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:52,050
and I'll tell you when I do, first of
all, I like to earn those things, right?

1606
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:55,620
I either earned them on the front end or
the backend, like one way or the other.

1607
01:47:55,621 --> 01:48:00,621
Like I either busted my ass and it did
a couple of days of hard working out and

1608
01:48:00,661 --> 01:48:01,980
all of a sudden, um, you know,

1609
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,820
I'm out with my good and we're swinging
by and all of a sudden I see there's a

1610
01:48:05,821 --> 01:48:07,770
little ice cream shop in the
corner. You know what? Hey,

1611
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,860
let's get a little ice cream.
There's a little little go time. And,

1612
01:48:10,861 --> 01:48:12,900
and one thing that I,
when I do it,

1613
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:17,070
I don't like have guilt when I'm sitting
there. I don't know. I'm not going,

1614
01:48:17,071 --> 01:48:20,970
oh my God, I can't believe I'm doing
this. No. I say, man, this is awesome.

1615
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,700
This does ice cream. Milkshake
taste great. That's great.

1616
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:28,820
But later on the,

1617
01:48:28,821 --> 01:48:31,920
either that night or the next day,
I earn that thing,

1618
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,680
put a little punishment in place.

1619
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:39,690
Little punitive reprimand
for slack behavior. And,

1620
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:43,380
and I'll tell you the thing you gotta
be careful of is that it is a slippery

1621
01:48:43,381 --> 01:48:47,100
slope. And as you mentioned,
like one potato chip

1622
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:52,020
can lead to 20 and it does lead to 20.

1623
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:57,090
And even that is like,
okay, understand we had a,

1624
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:58,980
we had a derailment,
right,

1625
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:05,210
but don't let one day of bad food lead
to another day of bad food and no working

1626
01:49:09,721 --> 01:49:12,240
out [inaudible].
That's what happens.

1627
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:14,520
That's what makes you sign off
the rails and it, and actually,

1628
01:49:14,521 --> 01:49:18,450
I mean there's like Tim Ferriss,
he's got that thing where he does,

1629
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:23,220
it's something like six days in a row
of eating super clean and then on the

1630
01:49:23,221 --> 01:49:25,180
seventh day you actually,
it's not just GPA,

1631
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:30,190
you have to like just get after it
because your body has to get the shock of

1632
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:34,340
carbs and all this stuff. There's
another big lie. Like you can tell you,

1633
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:37,650
you can twist your day all of a sudden
be like, well, you know first dude,

1634
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:44,790
but you do have to be careful
of the slippery slope.

1635
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:48,580
That for me, that's what,
that's what I happens. I think.

1636
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:50,950
I don't believe in this
stuff that you know you,

1637
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:54,340
you use up your willpower throughout
the day and you use up your discipline.

1638
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:59,260
I believe that your discipline decisions
create more discipline decisions.

1639
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:05,520
Now if I do just have a
disaster of a day or if I have,

1640
01:50:07,631 --> 01:50:08,680
let's say for whatever reason,

1641
01:50:08,681 --> 01:50:13,681
I have a two day just
gluttonous train wreck binge

1642
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:19,810
where I'm just, where I just for
whatever, I lose the bubble, you know?

1643
01:50:19,811 --> 01:50:23,140
And there's could be anything, any number
of things that could cause that maybe,

1644
01:50:23,141 --> 01:50:26,120
you know, it's like
multiple, I don't know,

1645
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:30,100
bad situation with travel than
with an event than with something.

1646
01:50:30,101 --> 01:50:32,470
They'll come home and it's a birthday
party and they there the only thing that

1647
01:50:32,471 --> 01:50:35,810
eats pizza and I'm like, you know
what it is and it's just done. Right.

1648
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:41,020
Is it better to hold the line yet is, um,
but if I do, everyone knows situations,

1649
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:45,880
then I'll usually react to that.
You know,

1650
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:49,360
I'll earn it later. I'll, if I go
on a just a terrible food thing,

1651
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:53,290
I'll do some kind of a fast, I'll do like
a 24 hour fast, maybe in a 48 hour fast.

1652
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,560
I haven't done a 72 hour,
but I'm gearing up to do a 72 hour.

1653
01:50:56,890 --> 01:50:59,950
What do you just drink? Water? Yeah,
just drink water. Just drink water.

1654
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:05,080
I did the 48 hour and it's at, it was
actually nothing. It was like, no problem,

1655
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:09,460
no factor. I did everything normal
squatted, went surfing, did Jujitsu,

1656
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:14,680
there's some guys on the mat and I said,
I was talking to big Eric, you know,

1657
01:51:14,681 --> 01:51:18,050
big Eric and as, hey, I got to tell you
something, when we get done training,

1658
01:51:18,051 --> 01:51:20,110
this is after,
this is on the second day of doing it.

1659
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:23,800
And so we trained a bunch and you
know, it was no factor. And he's like,

1660
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:27,250
what were you going to tell me? And I
said, I haven't eaten for for 48 hours.

1661
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:31,570
And I said, you know, I'm just trying
this out and I feel completely normal.

1662
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:35,200
So, uh, so that's, that's one of
the things I'll do a government,

1663
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:39,250
I'll just do some kind of, you know,
psycho kind of hardcore workout. Um,

1664
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:41,373
you know,
we,

1665
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:45,460
a body in motion tends to stay in motion
and a body at rest tends to stay in

1666
01:51:45,461 --> 01:51:49,810
rest. Don't let the momentum start going
the wrong way, you know what I mean?

1667
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,110
Get that body back in motion,
get back on track,

1668
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:57,680
snap yourself back into the discipline,
you know,

1669
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:02,830
crush some workouts,
get after it and get on that path,

1670
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:07,300
the path of discipline and
strength and stay there.

1671
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:08,681
You mentioned the,

1672
01:52:08,681 --> 01:52:13,681
the giving into the brain that you
are evolved to have or whatever,

1673
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:19,140
you know, and that's like seeking
out sugar and fat and you know,

1674
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:23,650
fat's not bad, right? But that's what your
evolved to want. And it's for a reason.

1675
01:52:23,651 --> 01:52:26,200
So, you know, put simply back
when you're a cave caveman,

1676
01:52:26,201 --> 01:52:28,850
you didn't know when the next
meal was coming from. So you know,

1677
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:32,850
you get that honey or
sugar that that means much.

1678
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:39,100
Eat as much as you can. So your brain's
still like that. Um, so a good tactic,

1679
01:52:39,101 --> 01:52:43,330
and I use this crazy crazily, it
worked. It worked for drinking.

1680
01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:45,120
Know I mentioned this too before,

1681
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:51,110
where you just understand that your
brain is in a way playing a trick on you.

1682
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:56,480
And if you give in
literally by this model,

1683
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:00,560
you just felt for a trick. And so
now you know that, right? So you're,

1684
01:53:00,561 --> 01:53:05,561
you're falling for a trick that is played
on you by your own brain because it

1685
01:53:05,961 --> 01:53:07,490
thinks it's,
you're still a caveman.

1686
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:11,720
So you see these donuts
or cake or I dunno, pizza,

1687
01:53:11,721 --> 01:53:14,840
something delicious and fatty.
You mean what you had for dinner tonight?

1688
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:19,990
He's seen my dinner.
And your brain is, hey,

1689
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:23,330
is this is one of those situations though.
It's your daughter's birthday party,

1690
01:53:23,331 --> 01:53:26,090
right? You got the family
over, what are you going to do?

1691
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:29,240
Put them all on a Paleo Diet for the
evening will tell you you're can get him

1692
01:53:29,241 --> 01:53:30,900
some pizza and ice
cream and it's all good.

1693
01:53:30,901 --> 01:53:32,770
And it's a little bit
a cake for Echo Gerald.

1694
01:53:32,830 --> 01:53:35,500
Basically that was lunch and then I had
a salad for dinner. Okay, good, good.

1695
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:40,740
Good job. So you disciplined, you're
here to back on the track. But so if you,

1696
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:45,760
you understand that you're, you just
fell for a trick right there. Um,

1697
01:53:45,761 --> 01:53:50,270
so now going forward, you know, we're
okay if I have these cravings or you know,

1698
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:55,090
that donut looks delicious,
whatever way, um, you're gonna,

1699
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:58,700
you're about to actively and consciously
fall for a chick right now. There.

1700
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:03,260
There's no scarcity of food
right now. There's an abundance
of food. And you know,

1701
01:54:03,261 --> 01:54:07,010
it's a perfect
phrase for this.

1702
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:12,330
Don't be a sucker. Yeah, exactly.
Like, like how often is he like, yeah,

1703
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:14,680
that's like the one of the worst
thing someone can tell you that hey,

1704
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:19,880
you are a soccer and that's why it worked
for you. Yeah. Don't be a sock. Yeah.

1705
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:24,560
So don't be a soccer to that piece of
your brain that's trying to trick you into

1706
01:54:24,561 --> 01:54:28,040
wanting stuff that's actually
bad for you. Yeah. So yeah.

1707
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:32,660
And so how the trick works is your brain
is saying, hey, those donuts, those are,

1708
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:35,420
those are beneficial.
And look at all these benefits.

1709
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:39,470
You'll get your calories, you know,
who knows when they're going to come.

1710
01:54:39,471 --> 01:54:41,330
That's what your brain is.
That's how it feels.

1711
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:44,930
They're going to come when you
ordered Domino's. Yeah. Yeah. That's,

1712
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:45,980
that's the reality.

1713
01:54:45,981 --> 01:54:48,740
But your brain brain's not telling you
that it's given you a crate because you

1714
01:54:48,741 --> 01:54:49,700
need all those calories.

1715
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:52,250
You don't know what it's going to
come and look at all these benefits.

1716
01:54:52,251 --> 01:54:54,770
It's going to taste good. And
they said, this is what you need.

1717
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:57,050
That's what your brain is telling you.
This is what you need.

1718
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:01,160
But the reality is you don't live in
that world anymore where you can get as

1719
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:02,450
many donuts as you want.
No.

1720
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:08,020
So it's tricking you into thinking that
the short term benefits are the benefits

1721
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,600
when in reality, since the world
we live in now is different.

1722
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,420
The longterm benefits of the benefits.
Yes.

1723
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:19,400
And they don't involve donuts or drinking.
Don't be a sucker. Don't be a sucker.

1724
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:22,730
Yeah, it helps me. It helps if you
care about being a sucker though.

1725
01:55:22,731 --> 01:55:23,810
That's the thing.
If you're like,

1726
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:27,290
I don't care about being stuck and
there's no way to be like in another way

1727
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:31,350
though. That's what I think too.
That's what I think too. All right,

1728
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:35,600
next question
Jocko.

1729
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:40,850
Is Buds the right filter for the kind
of people you want in the seal teams?

1730
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:44,130
Does it filter out good
people and letting the bat

1731
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:51,150
so buds is the basic underwater
demolition seal training and

1732
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:57,090
it does a decent job and I'm not going
to say that everybody that makes it

1733
01:55:57,091 --> 01:56:01,170
through buds is a guy that you want to
work with or even a guy that you want on

1734
01:56:01,171 --> 01:56:02,460
your team because

1735
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:09,060
one thing that happens in buds
is that punishment is dealt out,

1736
01:56:09,061 --> 01:56:12,810
right? I mean it's just suffering.
It's just hard work. It's, you know,

1737
01:56:12,811 --> 01:56:15,840
putting a boat on your head and being
cold and wet and all this stuff and you

1738
01:56:15,841 --> 01:56:18,990
either embrace that and crush it.
That's one way to get through.

1739
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:20,970
That's the way you should get through.

1740
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,620
But there are guys that they,

1741
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,980
they find a way to get buy in,

1742
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:32,220
to sneak by and to work the system.
Right?

1743
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:36,360
It does happen and those guys
definitely exist in the teams.

1744
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:40,440
Then the real team guys know who those
guys are. But the one thing that's hard,

1745
01:56:40,441 --> 01:56:44,810
it's hard for a civilian to know the
difference because two is really going to

1746
01:56:44,811 --> 01:56:47,370
seals the seal seal.
If you have your tried and you're a seal,

1747
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:51,690
you must be a bad ass. So what is it like
kind of like when your coaches saying,

1748
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:54,170
okay,
everybody push ups for you know,

1749
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:57,600
60 seconds and he's looking around and
when you see he's not looking at you,

1750
01:56:57,601 --> 01:57:00,720
you just kind of cruise, there's
sacrifice, there's all kinds of guys,

1751
01:57:00,721 --> 01:57:03,210
there's all kinds of little
corners that you can cut.

1752
01:57:03,211 --> 01:57:07,410
There's things you can get away with.
And the weird thing about buds is,

1753
01:57:07,411 --> 01:57:10,560
and I think Lafe talked about this
when he was on the podcast is,

1754
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:13,650
or maybe he didn't,
maybe we just had it in conversations.

1755
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:18,600
But you have a mentality when you're
going through buds is that you're,

1756
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:21,690
you're a team and you're trying
to help everyone get through.

1757
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:27,300
And so you don't like rat those guys out
when you see him cutting corners, you,

1758
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:30,810
it very seldom do you wrap one of
those guys out. Unless it's just a,

1759
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:35,460
an atrocious case. Most of the time
guys are, you know, like, hey man,

1760
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:39,570
are you okay? Like, Oh,
in instructors coming,

1761
01:57:39,571 --> 01:57:43,140
like they'll help people skate
through, right? So it's, it's,

1762
01:57:43,141 --> 01:57:47,250
it's pretty negative when you get through
buds and you're in the seal teams then,

1763
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,610
then you know, everyone
says to a man will say, oh,

1764
01:57:49,611 --> 01:57:53,550
I wish I wouldn't help anyone get through
because now they're in the teams and

1765
01:57:53,551 --> 01:57:57,600
now we can't count on them and now
we've got to carry their weight. So,

1766
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:03,990
so, so it is definitely a
test of making it through.

1767
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:05,490
But there's two ways to make it through.

1768
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:10,550
You can crush it and survive it or you
can sneak through it and skate through it

1769
01:58:11,841 --> 01:58:12,840
and it does happen.

1770
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:17,880
Now it's also mainly a physical test
and people talk about, no, it's mental,

1771
01:58:17,881 --> 01:58:21,660
it's physical, right? Yeah, there's a
mental aspect to it. No doubt. And if,

1772
01:58:22,570 --> 01:58:24,510
and if you're not mentally

1773
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:29,450
committed to making it through,
then it's going to be hard for you.

1774
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:34,310
But it's primarily a physical test and
physicality is actually a small part of

1775
01:58:34,311 --> 01:58:38,720
being a seal.
Now of course it's like a baseline factor.

1776
01:58:38,780 --> 01:58:43,300
I mean it is a factor as a CEO, you
gotta be able to do the job physically,

1777
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:48,220
but that's the baseline, right?

1778
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:53,550
And being a good athlete is definitely
does definitely not automatically make

1779
01:58:55,421 --> 01:59:00,421
someone a great seal because there's
guys that go through buds that are studs

1780
01:59:00,641 --> 01:59:05,260
physically and we get the seal teams.
They're not good,

1781
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:08,530
they're not good seals. They,
they might be a bad leader,

1782
01:59:08,531 --> 01:59:12,490
they might be unsafe or they can't shoot
or they can't handle the pressure or

1783
01:59:12,491 --> 01:59:17,491
they can't handle the grind because you
get a guy that's an elite level acts

1784
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:21,880
athlete and guess what?
He's used to elite level of food.

1785
01:59:21,881 --> 01:59:25,660
He's used to elite level of,
of treatments.

1786
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:31,030
He's used to an elite level of rest and
you get to the seal teams and there's no

1787
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:33,700
elite food. There's no elite
treatment, there's no elite rest.

1788
01:59:33,701 --> 01:59:38,230
There's just grind and you're out the
desert and you're just going on in the

1789
01:59:38,231 --> 01:59:42,010
operation after operation after operation.
In some of these high level athletes,

1790
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:45,610
there's such a fine tuned machine.
It's like we talked about before,

1791
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:48,940
they're like a Porsche or a race car and
what you want to be as a four by four.

1792
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:53,080
Like you can put diesel or biofuel or
whatever into that engine is going to keep

1793
01:59:53,081 --> 01:59:57,370
running. You have to put the high
acting clean stuff into the sports car.

1794
01:59:57,490 --> 02:00:01,450
And some of those guys break down on that.
And, and, and the reason is, like I said,

1795
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:04,450
it's because the seal
teams is not buds training.

1796
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:05,483
Mm.

1797
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:10,600
And I've said this before, no one in
the seal teams cares about buds turning.

1798
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:13,120
Once you've,
once you've gotten through buds,

1799
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:17,770
it's like as normal as brushing
your teeth, like everyone's
done it. No one says,

1800
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:20,170
Hey, did you brush your teeth?
No, we all want to her teeth.

1801
02:00:20,171 --> 02:00:22,900
We all went through buds. It's
not that big of a deal. Um,

1802
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:30,580
one thing that buds does do good though
is it does do a good job of finding

1803
02:00:30,581 --> 02:00:34,270
people's weaknesses and
whether it's swimming or
whether it's running or whether

1804
02:00:34,271 --> 02:00:36,280
it's the obstacle course or whether it's,

1805
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:40,600
whether it's lack of sleep or being in
the water and the water work that they

1806
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:44,500
make you do. If you have a weakness
of any of those areas, it's going to,

1807
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:47,500
it's going to show,
it's going to show.

1808
02:00:49,690 --> 02:00:51,160
But again,

1809
02:00:51,190 --> 02:00:55,960
some guys do find a way to make it through
and they end up in the teams and they

1810
02:00:55,961 --> 02:00:59,500
end up doing a couple of seal platoons.
But

1811
02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:01,060
okay.

1812
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:05,440
Again, being just being a seal
doesn't make you a bad ass.

1813
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:08,230
That's just the truth.
It doesn't make you a great leader.

1814
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:11,770
It doesn't make you a tactical expert.
It just doesn't,

1815
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:16,300
it means that you made it through the
training and you survived a couple seal

1816
02:01:16,301 --> 02:01:17,440
platoons.
That's what it means.

1817
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:22,830
Now there are plenty of seals that are
bad ass and great leaders and definitely

1818
02:01:24,881 --> 02:01:26,200
some tactical experts,

1819
02:01:26,201 --> 02:01:31,201
but it certainly isn't every seal cause
there's a bell curve in the seal teams.

1820
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:38,290
A bell curve. Just like any other group
of people or any other organization.

1821
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,760
And at the top of the bell curve,

1822
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:46,060
you got a bunch of relentless on stoppable
warriors that carry more than their

1823
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:52,010
share of the weight in the teams.

1824
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:57,370
And these are the guys that have built
or are building the reputation that the

1825
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:04,190
seal teams have.
And then in the middle of the curve,

1826
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:06,740
that's where you got the bulk of the guys.
And these are great guys.

1827
02:02:06,741 --> 02:02:07,551
They're great seals,

1828
02:02:07,551 --> 02:02:12,020
they do the job and they do it well and
they're outstanding professional combat

1829
02:02:12,021 --> 02:02:16,310
troopers who get the job
done and they get a job,

1830
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:20,210
they get the job done
on time and on target.

1831
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:25,510
And those are awesome solid guys that
maintain the reputation of the seal teams.

1832
02:02:27,231 --> 02:02:28,340
They maintain it.

1833
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:30,150
Okay.

1834
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:34,350
And then you got the crew at the bottom
and these are the guys that slipped

1835
02:02:34,351 --> 02:02:35,184
through the cracks.

1836
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:39,750
They work the system and while they're
technically classified as seals,

1837
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:45,800
these aren't guys that are like respected
by other guys in the seal teams.

1838
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:48,500
And quite honestly,

1839
02:02:48,501 --> 02:02:52,580
these are usually the guys that talk
the most and brag or boast about being a

1840
02:02:52,581 --> 02:02:53,414
seal.

1841
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:59,050
And these are the guys that they don't
build the reputation or maintain the

1842
02:02:59,051 --> 02:03:00,160
reputation to seal teams.

1843
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:04,150
These are the guys that live off
the reputation of the seal teams.

1844
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:05,483
Hmm.

1845
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:10,790
When in all likelihood they probably
haven't contributed anything themselves to

1846
02:03:11,491 --> 02:03:15,390
that reputation. Hmm. Leeches.

1847
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:19,993
But

1848
02:03:20,690 --> 02:03:24,360
that is what it is.
And,

1849
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:29,070
and as I always say, the teams
gave me everything, the good,

1850
02:03:29,071 --> 02:03:32,520
the bad and the ugly.
And I wouldn't,

1851
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:38,120
I wouldn't change a thing. I love
the seal teams, the frog man,

1852
02:03:40,350 --> 02:03:45,210
the Awu gunner in a seal platoon,
the point man, the corpsman,

1853
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:47,340
the radio man,
the rear security,

1854
02:03:49,480 --> 02:03:54,480
the platoon chief and the
LPO and the OIC and the Aoi.

1855
02:03:57,010 --> 02:04:00,500
See
those guys,

1856
02:04:00,501 --> 02:04:02,540
those guys in a seal platoon,

1857
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:07,230
the ones that carry the
weight and carry the torch,

1858
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:09,900
those guys are in my blood.

1859
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:16,930
I love those guys that
are always well, okay. Uh,

1860
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:19,990
last question
Jocko.

1861
02:04:20,710 --> 02:04:23,650
What does discipline really mean?
You know,

1862
02:04:23,651 --> 02:04:28,330
besides waking up early and how do I
employ it to all aspects of my life?

1863
02:04:29,470 --> 02:04:34,270
What does it really
mean? Yes, discipline it.

1864
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:39,060
It does start with waking up early.
It really does.

1865
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:40,433
Okay,

1866
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:44,580
but that is just the beginning in,

1867
02:04:44,581 --> 02:04:49,581
I always say that discipline is
the root of all good qualities,

1868
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:57,200
but you have to absolutely apply it to
things outside of just waking up early.

1869
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,490
It's, it's everything.
It's working out every day,

1870
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:07,260
making yourself stronger and faster
and more flexible and healthier.

1871
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:13,560
Discipline is eating the right
foods to a few. Your system,

1872
02:05:17,690 --> 02:05:18,523
it,

1873
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:23,480
it's about disciplining your emotions
so you can make good decisions.

1874
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:28,690
It's about having the
discipline to control your ego
so your ego doesn't get out

1875
02:05:31,461 --> 02:05:32,930
of hand and control you.

1876
02:05:36,230 --> 02:05:41,230
It's about treating people the way you
would want to be treated and and doing

1877
02:05:42,641 --> 02:05:46,420
the tasks that you don't
necessarily want to do,

1878
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:50,050
but that you know will
help you or help your team.

1879
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:56,840
It's about facing your fears.

1880
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:01,820
Takes discipline to face your
fears so you can conquer them.

1881
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:10,090
And that's what discipline is.
Discipline means taking the hard road,

1882
02:06:10,150 --> 02:06:11,920
the uphill road to do.

1883
02:06:11,921 --> 02:06:16,921
What's right for yourself
and for other people.

1884
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:25,190
It's so often the easy path,

1885
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:30,740
the easy path that calls to
us to be weak for that moment,

1886
02:06:30,741 --> 02:06:32,840
to break down for that moment

1887
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:39,420
to give in to the desire and
the short term gratification.

1888
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:45,410
But the discipline will not allow that.

1889
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:50,890
The discipline calls for
strength and fortitude and we'll,

1890
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:58,220
it won't accept weakness,
it won't tolerate another breakdown.

1891
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:04,150
The discipline CANSIM

1892
02:07:06,380 --> 02:07:07,850
like it's your worst enemy,

1893
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:12,110
but the reality is

1894
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:16,130
discipline is your best friend.

1895
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:21,340
It will take care of you like nothing
else can and it'll put you on that path,

1896
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:30,000
the path to strength and health
and intelligence and happiness.

1897
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,020
Most importantly,

1898
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:40,040
it'll put you on that path,

1899
02:07:41,410 --> 02:07:41,960
okay

1900
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:42,793
to freedom

1901
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:53,810
and I think that's all
we've got for tonight.

1902
02:07:56,110 --> 02:07:56,943
So

1903
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:02,270
thanks to everybody out
there for putting on those,

1904
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:05,210

listening to this podcast.

1905
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:09,140
Thanks for the feedback you give us.

1906
02:08:10,490 --> 02:08:14,510
It's definitely good to know that people
are listening and getting something out

1907
02:08:14,511 --> 02:08:17,240
of it.

1942
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:44,950
man. We're asking a lot
of the people. Yeah, I,

1943
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:49,880
I feel like, I feel like everyone
was kind of doing that anyway though.

1944
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,320
You know, it's, I think, who's
everyone? The people, man.

1945
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:59,300
The people, the people. Well, the
biggest thing is spread the word.

1946
02:10:59,870 --> 02:11:03,730
Spread the word if you want,
if you feel like, yeah,

1947
02:11:03,910 --> 02:11:07,820
if it's been worth your while,
spread the word and you know,

1948
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:12,740
really most importantly to you,

It's trying to get better,

1950
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:21,710

trying to do better.

1951
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,170
Thank you
