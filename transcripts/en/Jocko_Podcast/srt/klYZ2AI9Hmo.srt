1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,540
This is Jocko podcast number one
oh nine with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,360
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,220
Okay.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,930
One September,
1942 the army in the field,

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,270
comrade fighters,
commanders and political workers.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,820
Heroic defenders of Stalin Grad,

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,580
the bitter fighting for the city of
Stalin Grad has been raging for months.

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,870
The Germans have lost
hundreds of tanks and planes.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,470
Hitler's brutalized hordes are advancing
toward Stalin Grad and the Volga over

10
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:44,081
mountains of dead bodies of their own
men and officers are Bolshevik party.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,651
Our nation,

12
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:50,651
our great country have given us the task
not to let the enemy reach the Bolga to

13
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:53,450
disturb to defend the city of Stalin Grad.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,560
The Defensive Stalin Grad is of decisive
importance for the whole Soviet front.

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,090
Okay.

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,570
Without sparing our strength
and with scorn for death,

17
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:10,250
we shall defy the Germans the way to
the Volga and not give up Stalin Grad.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,310
Each one of us must bear in mind that
the capture of Stalin Grad by the Germans

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,960
and their advanced to the vulgar,

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,500
we'll give our enemies new
strength and weaken our own forces,

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,290
not one step back.

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,400
Okay.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,690
The war council expects on
unlimited courage, tenacity,

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,490
and heroism in the fight with the
onrushing enemy from all the fighters,

25
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:39,630
commanders, and political workers from
all the defenders and Stalin, Groton,

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,390
the enemy must and will be smashed
on the approaches to Stalin Grad.

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,240
Okay.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Forward against the enemy up into the
unremitting battle comrades for Stalin

29
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,180
Grad for our great country
death to the German invader.

30
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,093
Okay,

31
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,980
so that is a clearly a note
from the general on the ground.

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,800
The member of the war council
of the Stalin Grodd and
southwest front Lieutenant

33
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:22,801
General Khrushchev sent to the troops
obviously that we're preparing to defend

34
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,443
Stalin Grad.

35
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,043
Now

36
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,470
there was another commander in the field
by the name of Paulus and he sent a

37
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:42,971
note to Hitler on 23 November,

38
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,550
1942 my fear since receipt of your radio
message of evening 20 to 101 events

39
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:51,590
have come thick and fast.

40
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,360
We have not succeeded in closing the
pocket to the southwest and West.

41
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,160
In pending enemy penetrations
begin emerge there.

42
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,610
Ammunition and fuel are coming to an end.

43
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,360
Numerous batteries and tanks
have shot themselves dry.

44
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,560
A timely and adequate
supply is impossible.

45
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,260
The army will shortly be destroyed unless
a concentration of forces succeeds and

46
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,920
totally defeating the enemy
attacking from the south and west.

47
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,200
For this, we must immediately
withdraw all forces from Stalin,

48
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:29,380
Grad and strong detachments
from the northern front.

49
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,550
Unavoidable sequel must then be a breakout
towards the southwest since eastern

50
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:39,070
and northern front can no longer
be held with such weak forces.

51
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,730
In this case,
we will lose much material,

52
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,580
but the majority of the
valuable combatants and at
least a part of the material

53
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,620
will be preserved.

54
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,320
Okay.

55
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,760
I retained full responsibility for this
message even if I add that commanding

56
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:58,410
generals heights, Strecker,
Hubei, Jack Mill, von side.

57
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:03,411
Let's all share this evaluation of
the situation based on the situation.

58
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,020
I again request freedom of action.
Hi,

59
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,970
my fure signed Paulus,

60
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,930
so the Russians were effective
in surrounding the Germans,

61
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,520
the German sixth army.
As a matter of fact,

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,860
250 to 300,000 men fully
surrounded now by the Russians.

63
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,280
Okay.

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,540
Here's what Hitler wrote back.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,680
Six army has been temporarily
and circled by Russian forces.

66
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,060
I intend to concentrate the
army in the area, Stalin Grad,

67
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:43,061
north coat lube on hill one 37 hill one
35 Marineau Fucka Zit Benko stolid Grad

68
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:47,564
south.

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,400
The army may rest assured that I will
do everything to bring supplies to it

70
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,230
accordingly and relieve it in time.

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,360
I know the brave six army
and its commander and chief
and I am sure it will do

72
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:03,440
its duty,
signed Adolph Hitler.

73
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,740
So,
and we'll get into this.

74
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,830
Hitler over and over again is asked if
the troops on the ground can try and

75
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:21,210
escape from Stalin Grad and
over an over again. He says, no,

76
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,720
you cannot leave.
You will fight to the last bullet.

77
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,530
And on the 30th of January,
1943 Hermann goring,

78
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,810
who was the Nazi Reich's marshal
of the entire German racks,

79
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:40,811
or he's this senior military man of the
entire German army from 1940 until the

80
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,733
end of the war.

81
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,420
And even though Stalin
Grad had not fallen yet,

82
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,680
he gave this speech about their
sacrifice of these German soldiers

83
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,380
and he gave it, it was obviously
heard on the radio, et Cetera.

84
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,543
And it's spread.

85
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,020
And actually the soldiers on
the ground in Stalin Grad,

86
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,820
the German soldiers heard this speech,
and again,

87
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,680
we'll get more to what the reactions were,

88
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,680
but I'm going to read that
part of that speech right now.

89
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,720
It made one shutter,

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,940
but Stalin had enormous masses
at his disposal and used old men,

91
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:29,390
women and children, and did not
bother about supplies are sufficient.

92
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,870
Food or transport.
The Russians used the whip or the bullet.

93
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,200
The Germans alone could resist and
could wrestle with such an adversary.

94
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,580
Everything depended on them with the
greatest respect to other nations.

95
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,050
The Germans are the only ones in Europe
in a position to break Russia and

96
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:51,310
destroy bolshevism of
all the terrific battles.

97
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,140
The battle for Stalin Grad stood
out like a gigantic monument,

98
00:06:56,141 --> 00:07:00,430
which would one day be regarded as the
greatest and most heroic battle in German

99
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:04,480
history. So he's referring to this
in the past tense. Once again, this,

100
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:07,300
this hasn't been,
this hadn't finished yet,

101
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,360
but he's referring to it like it's in
the past tense because for all practical

102
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:15,250
purposes, it was back to the document.

103
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:20,251
Every German soldier would
come to pronounce the word
stolen grind with holy awe

104
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,390
and remember that it was there that germ
Germany set this seal of final victory

105
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,330
because people that
fought like that must win.

106
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,930
Germany has now become the
guarantor of European freedom,

107
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,550
culture and life.
But for the fighters of Stalin Grad,

108
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,900
the Russians might have obtained their
objective. Now they are too late.

109
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,980
The defenders of styling
rod had obeyed the law,

110
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:54,670
which everyone must obey the law to die.
For Germany,

111
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,420
this law was not only binding on soldiers,

112
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,120
but on the whole German nation.

113
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,370
The Nation must not question whether it's
stand at Stalingrad has been necessary

114
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:09,340
or not.
The law had ordered them to do so.

115
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,500
So here the saying don't
question one question.

116
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:16,501
The sacrifice of 250,000
men don't question it.

117
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,540
It was of no concern to the German soldier
whether he died at stolen rod in the

118
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,100
African desert or Norway.

119
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,080
He always sacrificed himself
so that his nation might live

120
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,600
in ours when some people perhaps tried
to install more bid and sly thoughts into

121
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:40,780
your brains than we must always look at.

122
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:44,590
The fear they're shining.
And greatest example,

123
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,300
they could believe that the
Almighty had led this man,

124
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:55,301
a God sent man to pass through
innumerable dangers and become greater and

125
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:02,061
greater all for nothing that
providence had given them,

126
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:06,290
this man who had made them into
the strongest nation in the world.

127
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,710
These are guarantees that
justify our belief in victory.

128
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,440
So we're talking about Hitler here,
by the way,

129
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,740
as a God sent Ma'am

130
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,840
in difficult times are real leaders tested
and people prove their worth in hard

131
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:26,920
trials.
I,

132
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,980
the commander in chief of the loof
[inaudible] suffered exceptionally when I

133
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,910
heard of the results of the bombings,

134
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,430
and although I did my best
to prevent it from happening,

135
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,800
it must be recognized as unavoidable
and must not influence our will for

136
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:42,670
resistance.

137
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,810
We know a tremendous heroic song from a
match without equal that was called the

138
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,290
battle of the need loans.

139
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,010
They too stood in a hall of fire and fire
quenching their thirst with their own

140
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:02,610
blood,
but fought and fought to the last

141
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,050
such a fight is raging there today
because of people who can fight like that

142
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,130
must win.

143
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,470
And before these men,

144
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,940
a millennia

145
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,980
previous there stood in a small gorge in
Greece and infinitely brave and daring

146
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,450
man with his 300

147
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,550
Leah nineties stood with 300 Spartans
from a tribe known for it's bravery and

148
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:34,574
boldness

149
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,240
and an overwhelmingly numerical
superior enemy attacked and attacked and

150
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,730
attacked again and again.
Even then,

151
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:47,480
it was a rush from the Asian
east against the Nordic people.

152
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,230
Huge numbers of men were
available to Xerxes,

153
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,180
but the 300 men did not waver or falter,
fighting a losing battle,

154
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,430
hopeless but not meaningless.

155
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,470
And then the last man fell.

156
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,000
And in this bottle neck
there is a sentence

157
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,153
wanderer.

158
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,280
If you come to Sparta report that
you had seen us lying here as the law

159
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:20,220
commanded,
they were 300 men.

160
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,510
My comrades and Millennia have passed.
But today that battle,

161
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:29,310
that sacrifice still counts as the
greatest example of heroic soldiering.

162
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,140
And today this fight is there.

163
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,380
This sacrifice is there and stolen Grodd
and one day it will be sad if you go to

164
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:43,330
Germany, tell them you have
seen us lying in stolen grog

165
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,340
as the law commanded us to protect
the security of our people.

166
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,240
And as I said,
those were the words of Herman goring,

167
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:05,230
who was the senior officer
of the German military.

168
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,610
Okay.

169
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,330
At that time.
And those were his words.

170
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,900
And of course his words were lies.

171
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
All of them were lies and no one knew
that better than the men on the ground.

173
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,060
Okay?

174
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,060
In and around the Russian city of Stalin
Rod nearly 1500 miles away from Berlin,

175
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,020
freezing, starving,
surrounded low on ammunition,

176
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,940
lacking medical supplies,

177
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,350
and lacking cold weather gear and
lacking any kind of real leadership.

178
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,600
And they also serve the intonation
that lacked the moral high ground.

179
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,903
Okay?

180
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,870
Does it matter of fact,

181
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:58,800
their nation's leaders lacked
any kind of morality to all,

182
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:02,430
and this is clear in the aggression
that they unleashed in the world and the

183
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:06,390
atrocities that they committed in
mass murder of millions of people.

184
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,650
And it's clear

185
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,290
that they had no morality whatsoever
based on how they treated their own

186
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,440
soldiers.

187
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,910
Okay.

188
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,570
Who,
like many soldiers

189
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,250
were men that were fighting not for
political powers or for political ideals,

190
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:34,140
created an an ivory tower,
thousands of miles away from them.

191
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,710
But for the ideals of a soldier himself,

192
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,370
duty and courage and honor,

193
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,730
that's what soldiers fight for.
Ed.

194
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,060
Okay.

195
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,740
The ultimate thing that they fight for
as we have heard time and time again,

196
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:58,741
is for their brothers on the line with
them to their left and to their right.

197
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,150
And one of those men

198
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,260
was named Yo Hakim

199
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,903
weeder.

200
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,180
He was an intelligence officer in the
eighth corps of the German six army.

201
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,820
And he wrote about his experiences in
a book called Stolen Gorod memories of

202
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:25,324
hell

203
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:26,850
yeah.

204
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,850
Where he recalls what he and other
German soldiers went through physically,

205
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,910
mentally,

206
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,310
yeah.

207
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,510
And spiritually.

208
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,070
Okay.

209
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,670
As they were abandoned by their leaders

210
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,970
as they were abandoned by life.

211
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,083
Okay.

212
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,560
And as they were abandoned.
Bye. Hope itself.

213
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,803
Okay.

214
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,090
Let's
go to the book

215
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,380
again.
This is your Keem weeder.

216
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,120
Yeah.

217
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,750
And the book is called Stolen
Grodd memories of hell.

218
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,273
No.

219
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,690
After meticulous preparations
of gigantic proportions,

220
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:28,590
the Russians with they're overwhelmingly
superior armor and cavalry forces

221
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:30,420
attacking like lightning from the north.

222
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:34,560
And the following day from the east
press star entire sits sixth army into an

223
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:38,620
iron vice.
Within three days,

224
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:43,621
the encircling ring was closed at
collage on the Dan and Co on the dawn and

225
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,070
constantly reinforced.

226
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,550
Okay.

227
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,383
Stunned.

228
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,710
We stared at our situation maps on
which medicine thick red lines of

229
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,440
encirclement and arrows
show the enemy attacks,

230
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,990
penetrations and directions of advance.

231
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,060
We had never imagined a catastrophe
of such proportions to be possible,

232
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:03,740
okay.

233
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,550
The mighty wedges of the Russian
armored columns could not be stopped.

234
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,860
And a myriad of highly mobile cavalry
troops' increase the muddle and confusion

235
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:17,270
in the rear of the bloody
rent front of the army.

236
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,230
Okay,

237
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,610
so you know, obviously I skipped a
little bit moving into this port point,

238
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:25,890
but at this point they're
completely surrounded, like I said,

239
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,380
cut off and the Russians
are applying the pressure.

240
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,590
The enemy appeared to be systematically
are evading our blows and to be

241
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:41,500
withdrawing into the depths of Russia.
So this is going,

242
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:46,090
he's kind of reflecting back on how they
ended up there and he says that he says

243
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,150
the enemy appeared to be systematically
evading our blows and to be withdrawing

244
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,430
into the depth of Russia.
This is what the Russians do.

245
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,720
It's what they did in Napoleon.

246
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,040
Okay,

247
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,760
in 1812 and they're doing it again here

248
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,200
and he back to the book,
taken as a whole,

249
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,060
this was a masterpiece of general staff
thinking today I'm convinced that those

250
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:11,080
withdrawals of what Russian forces during
the summer of 1942 or an outstanding

251
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:14,800
and Nachman of traditional
war Russian war tactics.

252
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,860
So Hitler got Lord in and
they didn't pay attention.

253
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,330
They didn't reflect on history.
And as we all, while I was,

254
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:30,331
most people know this was also Hitler
opening another front and trying to fight

255
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,010
on multiple fronts at the same time,
which,

256
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,240
which goes against a certain law of
combat called prioritize and execute.

257
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,900
Focus your, your forces on your most
important thing and then move on.

258
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,870
Hitler gets an F on prioritize and execute

259
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,050
back to the book it had now come to pass.
We were actually caught in a trap.

260
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,980
How were we to get out series as the
situation in the pocket and he refers to

261
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:59,040
this area as the pocket.
This is the pocket of Russian soldiers.

262
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,430
Serious has the situation in the pocket
was from the very outset in our bunker.

263
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:09,990
That was still an atmosphere of confidence
and a certain feeling of superiority,

264
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,940
so that's by the way,

265
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:16,290
that's how you end up in these situations
and the Germans absolutely believed

266
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,340
their own propaganda,

267
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,910
that they were the best soldiers in that
they were the master race and that the

268
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,710
these Bolsheviks couldn't fight them.
When you believe that,

269
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,710
you think you can march right into Stalin,

270
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,270
grab and take it and the wind is
not going to bother you immediately.

271
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,690
An eerie memory arose within
me and intensified my amp
apprehensive unrest with

272
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:39,750
each passing day.

273
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,250
It was the memory of several fanatical
statements that Hitler had recently made

274
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:48,180
in public speeches. The
German soldier. He said,

275
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,930
now stood on the vulva and no power on
earth could make him leave the supreme

276
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:59,040
warlord. That's a reference to
Hitler and he's got an in quotes.

277
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,200
The supreme warlord had
emphatically committed himself.

278
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,380
He had prophecized and demanded that
styling rod be relentlessly attacked and

279
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:13,050
taken in presumptuous terms.

280
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,920
He'd even sworn before God and history,

281
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,460
never again to relinquish on this
conquest presenting it as already achieved

282
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,320
with such an attitude as this on the
part of the supreme warlord was giving up

283
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:33,500
the vulgar and retreating
conceivable at all.

284
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,890
So Hitler had painted himself into a
corner with a paintbrush of arrogance and

285
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,950
it ended up in this situation where he's
saying, nope, we're never going to leave,

286
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,700
and he does not.
Back to the book,

287
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:53,450
the fate of more than a quarter million
human beings with decided over such a

288
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:57,980
distance so that the fewer
headquarters is 2000 mile,

289
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,240
2000 kilometers. It's like 1500 miles
distant away and they're making decisions.

290
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:05,750
This is called micromanagement, by the
way. This is called micro management.

291
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,820
This is not decentralized command.
This is the fourth law of combat.

292
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,650
From the book called extreme ownership.

293
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,800
Hitler gets an F on decentralized command.

294
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,860
He's micromanaging his troops
that are 1500 miles away.

295
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,570
The fate of more than a quarter million
human beings was decided over such a

296
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:28,460
distance from their Hitler repeatedly
addressed orders and appeals directly to

297
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,290
stolen,
wrote to the Stalin Ground Army,

298
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,520
which had been removed from under the
command of Army Group B and reassigned to

299
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:37,890
the newly form army group.
Don Don.

300
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,010
Don is a river now.

301
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:46,150
Everybody knew that they needed to perform
a military maneuver referred to as a

302
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:51,520
breakout, which means you picture your
inner circle, you're surrounded by troops.

303
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,930
You pick one part of that circle of,

304
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,270
of the people that are surrounding you
and you attack and you break through it.

305
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,260
It sounds like what it is,
it's a breakout.

306
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,620
Everybody knew that they needed to break
out. They're like, hey, we're surrounded.

307
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,340
We need fuel. We need water, we need
food. We don't have any of that.

308
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,600
We need to break out,

309
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,570
and so everyone was kind of prepared
to do that. Back to the book.

310
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:17,560
Our army still deposed of about 130 combat
ready tanks and about the same number

311
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:20,650
of armored scout cars and other
armored vehicles and other words.

312
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:24,760
We still had a powerful motorized
units available everywhere.

313
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:29,761
People were waiting for the relieving
signal for the breakout with fluttering

314
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:30,281
hearts.

315
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:34,750
We followed the preparations that were
taking place mainly in the western sector

316
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,980
of the army.
In anticipation of the expected operation.

317
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:43,390
The order had be given to destroy
all superfluous materiel everywhere,

318
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:47,100
damaged guns, tanks and trucks use this
communication and engineering equipment,

319
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,660
huge amounts of clothing,
files and paper,

320
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,180
even food where being consigned to flames,

321
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,110
so they all think that they're going
to break out there. Assuming, look,

322
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:59,260
we're going to break out this the only
solution right now. We're surrounded.

323
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,190
We need to attack one area and get out
of here. So they start going, okay,

324
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,370
before we leave, I'm going to burn as
fuel. We're going to burn this food.

325
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:09,670
We're not going to leave anything
for the Russians. Back to the book.

326
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,950
According to the decision by army command,

327
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:15,760
the retreat from Stalin Grad
was to begin on 26 November.

328
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:21,670
We did not entertain the slightest
doubt that the supreme command must be

329
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:25,990
convinced of its necessity. We counted
firmly on it's being carried out.

330
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,600
I will never forget how stunned
we all were. The agitation. Yes,

331
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,060
the petrifying,
a horror that befell us,

332
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:38,260
especially among the higher ranks
of our staff, went on 24 November.

333
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:43,261
The message came in from army that Hitler
had forbidden the plan breakout and

334
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:48,160
finally ordered the Stalin Grad army to
temporarily take up a position of all

335
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:52,270
around defense. So Hitler says, no,

336
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,140
you're not leaving. Oh,
you're surrounded by the way,

337
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:00,780
they're surrounded by a force of
about a million Russian soldiers, but,

338
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,220
but, but it's more than that
because they're surrounded
by the country of Russia.

339
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,121
Back to the book,

340
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:14,260
that fatal radio message from the
distant fure headquarters had come like a

341
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:18,580
stroke of lightning, forbidding the
plan, withdrawal of our northern front,

342
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,800
that attachment of our
forces from Stalin Grad,

343
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:23,020
and thereby the hope for the breakout.

344
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,300
This decision by the supreme command was
just as heavy a blow for the staff at

345
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,860
the army as it was for us.

346
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,520
We are unable to satisfy ourselves
as to why all the reports,

347
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,050
admonitions and requests
for our responsible of our
responsible higher staffs

348
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,950
who were best able to judge the events
and all the dangers they entailed had not

349
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,364
been successful.

350
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,460
So this is something that patents said
the commander on the ground is always

351
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,760
right. Meaning if you're sitting
in an ivory tower somewhere,

352
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,500
there's a guy on the ground, he's right
and you're wrong. He's on the ground.

353
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,940
He knows what's happening. Now, could
we come up with some exceptions to this?

354
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,580
Absolutely. You have better intelligence
of what's happening. You may know some,

355
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,170
you may be have overhead
coverage or you get,

356
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,100
you get air reports or you have the,

357
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:14,120
in these days you have satellites
looking at things. So yeah,

358
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,070
there's situations where you
might know a little bit more,

359
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,940
but the default thought process
should be the guy on the ground is,

360
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,310
is has a better situational
awareness than I do.

361
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:30,210
I'm going to go with their call and here's
Hitler saying no. Now, general policy,

362
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:31,510
who is the commander of all the,

363
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,070
all the German soldiers general,

364
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:39,640
Paul's back to the book General Paulus
addressed himself directly to Hitler with

365
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:44,230
a very serious and responsible evaluation
of the situation in this momentous

366
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:44,921
radio message.

367
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:49,160
He had adamantly stressed that the fact
that all his senior commanding generals

368
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:53,290
shared the conviction that because it
would be impossible to adequately supplied

369
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,250
the army in time,

370
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:57,850
it would shortly be destroyed unless a
concentration of all available forces

371
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,030
were to succeed in divine
decisively beating the enemy,

372
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,620
attacking from the west and the south.

373
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,040
So it's not just one general at
Saint Louis every but every user,

374
00:25:08,051 --> 00:25:10,870
there's,
there's 250 to 300,000 Germans there.

375
00:25:10,871 --> 00:25:13,060
There's a lot of senior military people.

376
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,350
All of them are saying,
we need to leave.

377
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,960
Hitler Says No. Why? Because
Hitler's just that like, no, you got,

378
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,050
you guys don't leave because we're
were Germans. We flight till the Dan.

379
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,050
It's arrogance or,
I mean it's,

380
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:33,040
it's absolutely partially arrogance
that he thinks no, we'll hold out.

381
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,950
It will still just when two
were us. Yeah. We'll just,

382
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,951
we'll just hold it out and I
think he's being stubborn and,

383
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:42,590
okay.

384
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,880
Yeah. He has the kind of word like
he, he made a call kind of thing.

385
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:48,200
He made a call and then they're like,
hey, we this, the call is no good.

386
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:51,110
We're going to do this. He's like,
no, I made the call. Yeah, exactly.

387
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:52,010
What's going on?
Ego.

388
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,290
I mean obviously Hitler has probably one
of the biggest egos of any human being

389
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,890
ever can hear you see it.
Yeah, sure. In full effect.

390
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,150
Okay.

391
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,760
Even though he had left,
no doubt, but in his view,

392
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:10,140
the decision promising salvation lane,
an immediate breakout in the end,

393
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:15,141
he to this talking about policy in the
end he to submitted and obeyed for him in

394
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,930
order was an order in spite of everything.

395
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,030
All that remained to us was to hope for
a rescue operation from the outside.

396
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,500
I will say this actually,

397
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,710
and there's some books that the parts
of this book that I'm not going to cover

398
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,130
because we just don't have time.
Well,

399
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,890
there's that guy that gave that
speech goring the beginning.

400
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,000
He had also told Hitler, Hey, no worries.

401
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:44,190
We can resupply. He was the before taking
over all the German military forces.

402
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,950
He was in charge of the German
air force, the Luftwaffe. Uh,

403
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,980
and he said, look, we can resupply these
guys. Don't worry about it. Don't worry.

404
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,420
And I think he probably said that at a
time when it didn't look like they're

405
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:00,210
going to get completely surrounded, you
know? Oh yeah, we'll, we supply him,

406
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:01,044
don't worry about them.

407
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,380
And we'll get into some of the numbers
on what they said they could do.

408
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,210
But that's another reason why Hitler,
Hitler thought, Oh, we can resupply.

409
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:10,560
But he also had people on the ground.
He's surrounded by, yes men. Gotcha.

410
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,860
So no one wants to disagree with
the boss, man. In this case,

411
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:18,330
Adolf Hitler by saying, so when he
says, look, can't we resupply them?

412
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,920
Yes, yes, we can respond from the air. And
also he was saying, hey, can't someone,

413
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,060
instead of them breaking out and
going toward back towards Germany,

414
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,720
why don't we have some German troops
go towards them and break into them?

415
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,720
That way we can open up some supply lines.
So when did he get told when he,

416
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:38,610
when he offered that solution,
he got told, yes, we can
do it. Yes, we can do it.

417
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,110
So he's surrounded by yes men.

418
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,040
And you know how he ended up surrounded
by yes men. His Ego. I don't want,

419
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,040
I don't like to be told, oh, you're
going to tell me no, you're fired.

420
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,980
Get someone in here that's going to tell
me that they can do what I'm saying.

421
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,050
And then that person's
going to get promoted.

422
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,330
And then you get surrounded by
people that want to get promoted.

423
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,573
Chuck

424
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,110
proceeding on and there was one
general that really made it,

425
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,780
made a significant effort.
Here we go back to the book initially,

426
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,980
General Vaughan side. Litz
was dumbfounded, stunned.

427
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,700
He accepted the order,
but in his heart he rejected it.

428
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,200
Particularly since he was painfully
aware that his own war hands were tied.

429
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,290
Not until the following day, 25,
November, 1942 did general von side,

430
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,000
let's react to Hitler's orders.

431
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:37,110
And his reaction was as much filled
with a sense of responsibility as it was

432
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,110
temperamental,
addressed to the army command.

433
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,250
It took the form of a detailed evaluation
of the situation that core commander

434
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,230
had had his chief of staff
prepare. It's surmised, once again,

435
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:54,231
all the arguments against the solid
ground army digging in and urged the

436
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,030
breaking out of the ring immediately.

437
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,790
So what's cool about this book,

438
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,910
they actually have this actual
document that this guy wrote.

439
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,910
Have you ever heard me talk on the podcast
about getting all your ducks in a row

440
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,160
and like, Hey, if my boss tells
me now, cool, I'm going to,

441
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,380
I'm going to get all the information,
I'm going to come back.

442
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,390
And how many agree if I'm going to make a,
uh,

443
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,830
a bullet proof argument and my boss is
going to agree with, because you can't,

444
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,760
my argument's gonna be bulletproof
because I'm right. And if I wasn't right,

445
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:24,840
then I wouldn't, I wouldn't
go this far, right? I'm not
gonna, I'm not gonna put my,

446
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,590
my reputation on the line
arguing something that I
don't truly believe is right.

447
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,030
You know, all through I'll say, okay,
well you know what, he could be right,

448
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,700
so you know what, I'm going to try and
execute it to my best of my ability.

449
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,010
In this case. Sidelights is
like, no, it's not. No. And,

450
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,950
and he says, okay, I'm going to perform.
I'm gonna put together this thing.

451
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,900
They have the document inside this book.
I would read it, but it's long. It's,

452
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,730
it's so detailed that it
would take too much time,

453
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,140
but it lays out every little detail of
why they need to break out and not in an

454
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,550
emotion. That's what's beautiful about
it. Not In an emotional way. Well,

455
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,720
maybe I just need to check myself
because maybe more emotion was needed.

456
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,070
But generally if you come across as
really emotional, Hitler would think, oh,

457
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,250
well a boss would think, oh, you're
just emotional about this echo.

458
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,210
You're just emotional buddy. You just
need to calm down, carry out the orders.

459
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,160
So he didn't he, he played the role or
he, he used the strategy of just calm,

460
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,810
this is what's going on.

461
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,470
This is what needs to change or this
is what we need to do and if we don't,

462
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,180
it's going to be catastrophic.

463
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,590
Back to the book in the
emergency situation,

464
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,520
intensified by the o k h and o cages
over commandos date eight or switches,

465
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,040
the supreme high command of the German
Army General Vaughn side lifts demanded

466
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:42,700
from the commander in chief of the army
that he act immediately against orders,

467
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:46,120
in other words, against Hitler. So, so
sidelights when silence got told no,

468
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:49,360
he's like, no, listen, we need to do
it anyways. That's how passionate.

469
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:51,250
So now he's starting to get a
little bit emotional and passionate.

470
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,630
He declared it to be an imperative duty
to the army and the German people to

471
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,670
obey the dictates of conscious and to
seize the freedom of action that had been

472
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:03,400
forbidden in order to prevent
threatening catastrophe.

473
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,440
The memo was passed on by army command,
but had no effect whatsoever.

474
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:15,490
And so they had to suffer the additional
pain that in the final analysis they

475
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:16,324
could,

476
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:21,330
but give in and fulfill the bidder
soldierly duty to obey against their own

477
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:23,164
better insight.

478
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,370
Now I will tell you that as Napoleon said,

479
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:30,040
if you execute a plan
that you know is wrong,

480
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,000
you are culpable for
executing it and these guys,

481
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,660
they would not stand up against it.
Like

482
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,691
back to the book,

483
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:45,010
we were all deeply disturbed and full of
despair and in our hearts even outraged

484
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,770
what was being demanded of
us normally contradicted.

485
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,800
All military experience at win against
every soldierly feeling and robbed of has

486
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:57,700
any hope of any hope of being able to
save ourselves by breaking out under her

487
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:58,534
own power.

488
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,400
Okay.

489
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,970
In the last week of November when the
formations that had been heavily damaged

490
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:08,020
during the initial retreat where hastily
and with great difficulty establishing

491
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:13,021
themselves on a new main
line of Resistance Army
issued a grave order of the

492
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,140
day. I can still remember
the exact wording it started.

493
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,650
Six army has been surrounded.
This is not your fault

494
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,790
as always, you have fought bravely
and tenaciously up to the moment.

495
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:29,010
The enemy had you by the neck.

496
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,930
It went on to point out
that the hard fighting,

497
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:36,250
suffering and deprivations that would
still be demanded of the troops and which

498
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:39,410
they would have to endure for
a time in hunger and frost.

499
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,430
Trusting in the help from outside
that had been so definitely promised.

500
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:45,230
So Hitler did say, Hey, I'm going
to send help from the outside.

501
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:46,460
Don't worry about it.
You stay put.

502
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Finally mentioned was made of the
relief operation to which Hitler had

503
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:55,421
personally committed himself
psychologically clever
and calculating the appeal

504
00:32:56,181 --> 00:33:00,140
ended with the encouraging words,
promising consolation and salvation.

505
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,780
Hold on the fure,

506
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,620
we'll get you out this final sentence.

507
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:08,480
Appealing so strongly to emotion,

508
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,830
which injected a new tone into the
previously factual and sober language of

509
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:16,370
military orders gave rise to
discussions among our staff.

510
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,110
It made me realize on top of
all that had already happened,

511
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,350
how great the sacrifice was going to be
that would be demanded of the troops.

512
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,113
By the way,

513
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,190
these guys traveled there and
had a really hard time of it.

514
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,850
They know how hard it was
for them to get there,

515
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,390
and now they're being told that
the people that are going to,

516
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,370
the way that they're going to get saved
is by someone else coming behind them to

517
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:53,330
help them going through the same
hardships that they barely got there.

518
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,940
So they're there.

519
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,710
Their outlook isn't good on the
situation he had. They're doubtful.

520
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,941
Back to the book,

521
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:05,560
a large number of the soldiers who
had been in constant exhaustion is

522
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,950
incontinent and exhausting action in the
front line for two years without leave,

523
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,930
without having been home to see their
loved ones. So a lot of these guys,

524
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:17,690
so they had actually
survived a winter early on.

525
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,160
They had survived a winter as they
pushed into German or as they put it into

526
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:24,740
push in Russia and now they're
waiting for another one.

527
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,350
But these soldiers had been
fighting for two straight years.

528
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,580
Hard fighting back to the book.
Naturally the troops,

529
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:34,430
we're not in a position to appreciate
the full extent of the suffering and

530
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:36,140
deprivation as they were about to face.

531
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,550
They knew nothing of the difficult
problems of the overall supply situation.

532
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:44,510
So again, this guy is working at the
headquarters, meaning he's, you know,

533
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:46,640
with the commanders and the leadership,

534
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,400
so he's tracking all the
logistics of the situation.

535
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,630
The frontline soldier doesn't know.

536
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,700
The front line soldier expects that
they're going to bring me bullets,

537
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:53,534
they're gonna bring me food.

538
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,800
He realizes because he sees
what's actually happening
and that that's going to

539
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:58,790
be a real problem.

540
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,220
They had no inkling of the countless
worries that lay so heavily and

541
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:06,410
depressingly on the higher staffs,

542
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,920
nor at first were they aware that that
at one stroke the encirclement had made

543
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:17,390
it impossible to complete preparations
for winter positions out there and the

544
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:22,130
supply depots of the army,
late tens of thousands of fur coats,

545
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,540
warm stockings, protective headgear,
and other items of winter clothing,

546
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,310
which could now no longer reach the
encircled forces. For the most part,

547
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,520
the men remained completely inadequately
supplied with winter gear and exposed

548
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,590
to the murderous frost is that thousands
and thousands of warm weather gear

549
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,650
or I should say cold weather gear
and now they're going to get nothing.

550
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,480
They're caught off back the book.
We calculated that our own army,

551
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:56,190
whose total strength before the INCIRCL
men had been about 330,000 men now

552
00:35:56,191 --> 00:36:00,480
numbered about 280,000 so they're
already short at 50,000 and killed

553
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,510
we the staff,

554
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,900
the officers in the staff departments
also pinned our hopes on the relief

555
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:09,520
operation,
which was being prepared.

556
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,780
No one even considered that Hitler would
be ready to abandon the outstandingly

557
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:17,800
proven six army on the Vulcan, throw it
to the wolves. So these guys are even,

558
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,720
I said that even though I
said they weren't hopeful,

559
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,960
they're also thinking there's no way
that Hitler is going to leave 300,000

560
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:30,100
soldiers out here. There's no
way. Yeah. Back to the book,

561
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:34,210
he was bound to find ways and means
to rectify the devil situation.

562
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,730
There were even starry eyed
dreamers, not, however,

563
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:40,060
among the older and more experienced
who maintained that the fewer would not

564
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:40,990
only get us out,

565
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,590
but it probably already conceived a
plan to turn our apparent defeat into a

566
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:48,340
glorious triumph. By and circling all the
enemies armies that are surrounding us.

567
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,490
None of these dreamers and
believers in miracles who kept this,

568
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,840
who kept surfacing here and
there until the very end,

569
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,180
had a clear idea of what was implied
by the fact that German soldiers will

570
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:05,181
simultaneously fighting on the North Cape
and the Bay of Biscay and the front of

571
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,380
Leningrad and veers on in the
caucus in Crete and in north Africa.

572
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,060
Okay,

573
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,610
so again, this guy's fighting
fronts all over the place

574
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,580
and the and the staff officers,

575
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,750
the leadership knew how thinly
spread the German army was.

576
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,930
The frontline troops in, you know,
they didn't make sense of that.

577
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,520
During the weeks of December,

578
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,270
the fighting strength of the army was
deteriorating at a horrendous pace.

579
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,690
The blame for this lay mainly in the,

580
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,270
in the inadequate air lift here,

581
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,100
a catastrophic picture was slowly emerging
in order to be able to maintain its

582
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:46,540
ability to live and fight.

583
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:51,570
Our army had initially requested
750 tons of supplies per day,

584
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,860
okay.

585
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,260
Later reducing this to 500 tons per day.

586
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,080
The J you 52 cargo aircraft
had about a two ton load.

587
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,440
The want the h g one one one fighter
bomber had held about 1.5 tons.

588
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,990
So this is going to require like 2000
aircraft to be able to make this happen.

589
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,280
What do they end up with?
Back to the book,

590
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,810
they only brought in 80 to 120
tons of the required supplies.

591
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,831
In other words,

592
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:31,831
not more than one fifth of the amount
needed purely and simply this meant a

593
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:37,271
daily deficit of 10,000 kilograms bread
and a fatal under supply of desperately

594
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:43,090
needed fuel and ammunition. So we're
getting one fifth of what they need.

595
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:47,470
Now we have to be careful cause that's
a little statistic that were thrown out

596
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:51,040
there, right? Like oh we're
getting one fifth of what we need,

597
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,540
but I'll think of a human being. And
what you need is a human being just food.

598
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,090
And you cut that down to
one fifth of what you need.

599
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:03,040
You know you need 2,500 calories a day,
you're going to get 500 [inaudible].

600
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,430
That's what we're talking about.
Yeah, you need, and by the way,

601
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,430
you're fighting and you're going to,
you're being attacked.

602
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,210
So you need thousand bullets a day.

603
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,590
Okay.

604
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,950
Right. You need a thousand bullets
a day. You're getting 120 bullets.

605
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,660
It's there.
Things are not looking good.

606
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,290
Back to the book, the
sunset, soon after lunch,

607
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,370
and by 1400 and 1500 hours, it
was already dark. So this is,

608
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:37,880
now we're talking Russian winter by
two or three o'clock in the afternoon,

609
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:38,714
it's dark.

610
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,583
Hmm.

611
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,740
And every day this to reminded us,

612
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,900
depressingly here in the desolation of
the snow Brep snow bounce step of the

613
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:52,901
enormous distance that separated us from
home were we not all the living and the

614
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:59,210
dead long buried in a gigantic mass grave.

615
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,740
Thoughts like this occasionally befell
me when I returned from various sectors

616
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:06,800
of the front,
where in my role as liaison officer,

617
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,150
I had been sent on specific assignments
to gather urgently needed information.

618
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:12,690
Okay?

619
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,980
They're on the heights above the,
the infamous row shock a valley.

620
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,240
The men of our divisions
lay in desperate battle,

621
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:25,860
demanding bloody sacrifice there in
the trenches, in foxholes, in the snow.

622
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:30,750
The soldiers were dying of exhaustion
and cold because they're steadily

623
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:34,830
shrinking. Rations of bread and
other food issued. Food issued.

624
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,270
We're no longer sufficient to provide
the physical stamina needed to combat

625
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,230
frost at sickness,
so they're starving to death.

626
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,280
They're starving to death in
the freezing death and they're,

627
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,310
they're being attacked and killed by
the Russians with no with no Emma.

628
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,660
One day in the second week of December,

629
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,180
the staff's first heard the news that
the army group, dawn under field,

630
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:05,181
Marshall Van Main Stein von Main Stein
had begun the long hope relief for the

631
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:10,320
long hope for relief operation. Soon the
good news, it also reached the troops.

632
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,910
The words gave new impetus everywhere
in particularly on the hard pressed

633
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:19,140
western perimeter of the pocket spread
like lightning mainstream man Stein is

634
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:19,974
coming.

635
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,200
The already dying hopes burst
forth the new new courage,

636
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,070
happy expectations. A new spirit
of initiative began to blossom.

637
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,850
The sufferings and sacrifices to
date had not been in vain. After all,

638
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,930
salvation was now beckoning what the fewer
had promised he was bound to deliver,

639
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:43,580
so they get word Ben Stein's coming.
This is this,

640
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,910
this is good. If everything
went well, they fought,

641
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,470
the hour of all relief could
just coincide with Christmas.

642
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:59,770
The motorized groups and strong tank
units being led by Colonel General Hoff

643
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,930
elements of which had been brought in
from France in great haste had begun their

644
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,430
relief,

645
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:09,050
offensive Hoff spearhead tanks
were only 50 kilometers away.

646
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,540
Hold on.
We're coming.

647
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,980
Said one of the encouraging radio messages
would spread like wildfire amongst

648
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:20,300
the western edge of the pocket. So they're
in radio communication 50 kilometers

649
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:26,830
and this well respected leader Hoff.

650
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,270
He's on the way and he tells him,
hold on, we're coming. Do you ever,

651
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,380
isn't that like a jinx right
there? You know what I mean? Like,

652
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:39,290
do you ever celebrate something
even even inside your head,

653
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:42,410
you celebrate something a little bit
before? You should don't ever do that.

654
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,870
Am I superstitious?
Because I believe that way.

655
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,430
If you think that that's
how it truly works.

656
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,960
But I think, um, I th I
think it's superstitious,

657
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:55,910
but I also think there's some psychology
behind that. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah.

658
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,410
Yeah. Especially if you realize,
if you just realize, oh,

659
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,320
I just celebrated early right there.
So it's,

660
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,280
it makes you uneasy or
something like that.

661
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,720
I feel like that guy,

662
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,430
that guy got a certain level
of satisfaction just by
saying like, don't worry,

663
00:43:09,431 --> 00:43:11,860
we're coming. Like he had this
moment of glory. That's glorious.

664
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:15,730
It's a glorious thing to be able
to say, don't worry, we're coming.

665
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,830
It's a glorious thing to be able to say,
and he took that.

666
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,010
He took the easy money right there

667
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,130
psychologically, instead of being
like, hey, we're not there yet.

668
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:31,690
We need to be ready to worry about
where we are. Yeah, yeah. The yeah.

669
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,120
Finish strong kind of thing. It's like the
guy who's running the touchdown, right?

670
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,600
He celebrates the 30 yard line, right?
The 25 he puts the hand up. Who was that?

671
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:44,350
There's like a classic creeps
up behind them. You know what?

672
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,070
This guy wasn't even Leon Lett.
He played for the,

673
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,740
I want to say Dallas cowboys.
He was like a,

674
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,990
like a deep, deep, I want
to say nineties maybe.

675
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,360
How many other Dallas cowboy players
can you remember the name of from the

676
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:03,090
nineties do you remember?
A lot of them.

677
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,470
Like a handful. Just let the coroner,
Leon, he's infamous for this. I mean,

678
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,370
poor guy, you know, he, he's a
defensive line man or something.

679
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:17,080
Recovers a fumble, runs it in for
the touchdown and he's, he's doing,

680
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:18,970
he's not even doing and putting
it in the above his head.

681
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,620
He's putting it on the site,
kind of like celebrating it's,

682
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,590
and I think they stripped
him and recovered it I think
if I'm not mistaken. Yeah,

683
00:44:26,591 --> 00:44:29,260
it was bad.
Psychologically you can't stop.

684
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,070
You gotta Kinda strong zee money
you to finish the sprint to the

685
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,690
finish line or that like
races, like a hundred meter
dash, you know the guys like,

686
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,720
or the 200 meter and he's like,
yeah, I want it. Then the guy,

687
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,570
I'm real hungry guy gets it, you know,
right at the end. So that's Hoff.

688
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,520
Hoff takes the easy money
tank can be doing it off.

689
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,770
Back to the book in the sure knowledge
that before us was the last chance for

690
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,491
our salvation.

691
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:54,090
We feverously awaited the decisive
hour with a feeling of confidence.

692
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,560
The orders we expected could
not be delayed much longer,

693
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,760
but all too soon. Our hopes were
to be bitterly disappointed.

694
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,600
Alarming messages began to came in
rapidly attacking Russian tank forces were

695
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:10,320
embroiling,
the relieving army and heavy fighting.

696
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,640
We're slowing the advance and finally
leading in connection with the Russian

697
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:19,641
offensive group operations west of the
dawn to a serious crisis for the entire

698
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,180
army group.

699
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:27,810
One of the attacks hit Colonel General
Hoff who is hastening towards us in

700
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:31,230
fearful tension and delay
mounting an agitation.

701
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,010
We read the messages we were receiving
from the far distant German air

702
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:38,550
reconnaissance and radio
surveillance you units soon.

703
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:40,380
These brought news of disaster.

704
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,680
The relief operation had began to run
down Hoff's forces in turn threatened with

705
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:50,050
being surrounded.
We're finally forced to retreat.

706
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,980
The front fell back hundreds of kilometers
and the encircled Stalin Grad or me

707
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:59,070
on the Volga was left to its fate.

708
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,253
Yeah.

709
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:06,200
Only much later was I to learn of tragic
details of the events and circumstances

710
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:09,080
that had sealed the fate of the
encircled army. At this point,

711
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,240
I did not know then that Hitler was still
in no way prepared to give up stolen

712
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:19,241
ground on the vulgar that for the second
time and after the dramatic conflicts

713
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:21,890
and the conflicts that he's talking about,
his between him,

714
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,050
between Hitler and the
people that his advisors,

715
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,480
he had explicitly forbidden the breakout
of the six army against the will of his

716
00:46:29,481 --> 00:46:33,560
chief of staff and an opposition to
the demands of the army group dawn.

717
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:38,743
So

718
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,410
hit little leaves them,

719
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,700
abandons them back to the book.

720
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,740
Among the circle of our closer comrades,

721
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:50,670
we no longer entertained any illusions
about the bleakness of our situation.

722
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,450
The German front had withdrawn a great
distance away and for the time being

723
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:57,360
there would be no new thought or Knuth.

724
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,730
No thought of a new relief operation.

725
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:06,560
Would the German front be able to
hold out for several more weeks?

726
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,170
It was hardly to be expected.
Hunger, frost and sickness.

727
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:13,370
We're cutting terribly.

728
00:47:13,371 --> 00:47:18,371
Intuit's waning strength and deaf was
reaping and an uncanny harvest and not

729
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:22,910
only on the fire spewing
iron ring around the pocket.

730
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,290
Yeah.

731
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,150
And even the conditions for a great saving
breakout operations scarcely existed

732
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,700
any longer.
In such an event,

733
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:35,380
the army would only be able to remain
mobile for a few kilometers because the

734
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:36,214
lack of fuel.

735
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,180
Yeah,

736
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,420
and if Stalin Grad will
work to be given up,

737
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,720
what then would happen to
the growing army of wounded,

738
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,940
sick and exhausted men?

739
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,100
Did the o k h intend to
give up the vulgar at all?

740
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:55,590
The measures ordered so far seem to
point the opposite way. Once again,

741
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,800
I was often forced to recall Hitler's
fanatical wor words about the German

742
00:48:01,021 --> 00:48:03,270
soldier on the vulgar about Stalin Rod,

743
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:08,100
and each time an icy uneasy
crept through my bones,

744
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,080
maybe yes,

745
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:15,081
maybe we were supposed to hold on to the
bitter end to stay put and fight to the

746
00:48:15,451 --> 00:48:16,410
last bullet.

747
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,890
Okay.

748
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,210
On the dark horizon,

749
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,350
the outlines of a terrible
disaster began to emerge.

750
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:31,220
Christmas eve approached all the
visible and the invisible wounds,

751
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:35,300
which the cruel events had caused,
burned even more painfully on this night.

752
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,340
The atmosphere was depressed.

753
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,600
Memories of former Christmas
celebrations with their blissful Shimmer,

754
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,720
only dimly illuminated are harsh reality.

755
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,940
As from a world bone gone.

756
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,573
Okay.

757
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,840
The well loved Christmas carols
sounded in low melancholy this.

758
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:03,210
So hope is pretty much vanquished
at this point. Not Completely,

759
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,340
cause he's still in May.
He's still saying maybe,

760
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:07,560
maybe they're just going to leave
us here and fight to the last man,

761
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:11,010
which is a crazy thought because
I'm going to say this number again,

762
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:16,470
250 to 300,000 soldiers.
This isn't like,

763
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:20,280
Hey, you've got 18 guys fight to last
man. It's the Alamo, right? Yeah.

764
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,290
This isn't that. This is
because that, that might have,

765
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,300
you know that that's not going to have
a strategic impact on the situation.

766
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:35,070
You lose 300,000 combat veterans,
which,

767
00:49:35,071 --> 00:49:37,680
which, you know, the hard
combat hardened veterans,

768
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,200
this is going to have a
strategic implication. Mm.

769
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,030
I mean of course every
soldier that dies is,

770
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,380
is a epic of event in that soldier's life,

771
00:49:49,381 --> 00:49:51,420
obviously in their family
and everything else.

772
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:58,550
But when you start talking about leaving
300,000 people to die for nothing,

773
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,160
it's, it's, he still can't quite get
that. He's still not quite there.

774
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,040
He sees it on the horizon.
He's not quite there though.

775
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,730
Back to the book.
The New Year had arrived.

776
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,690
Okay.

777
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:17,650
Jangling frost layover stolen grot over
the stall and drug pocket and breathe.

778
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,390
It's icy,
deadly breath.

779
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,490
The sharp wind blew through the joints
of doors and windows and in the bunkers

780
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,070
and from the floors,
the cold crept up to one's knees.

781
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:33,170
The daily casualty reports
from our divisions that
increasingly reported losses

782
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,550
other than by enemy action represented
a shattering balance on the death sheet.

783
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,790
So what he's saying there is like,
yeah, people are dying from combat,

784
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,620
but even more people are dying just
from cold and starvation. Yeah. Again,

785
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:50,700
the Russians furiously attacked
several sectors of our perimeter.

786
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,020
What did we have left to oppose these
powerful Russian elite troops who were

787
00:50:55,021 --> 00:50:57,450
protected from the frost
and had a full stomach?

788
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,010
Not to mention there numerous tanks,
guns, rocket launchers, and mortars.

789
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,470
The only small numbers of heavy
weapons with insufficient,

790
00:51:04,471 --> 00:51:06,090
strictly rationed ammunition.

791
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,280
It's all we had only emaciated men
exhausted by hunger among whom?

792
00:51:13,891 --> 00:51:16,770
The fighting the cold
and spreading diseases.

793
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,980
We're taking a daily frightening tall.

794
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,260
How much longer could the
perimeter withstand the pressure?

795
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,430
It did not escape our attention that the
Russians appear to be concentrating in

796
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:33,050
front of our sector in preparation
for a major blow. The last sob,

797
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,410
sad possibility grew even
clearer on the dark horizon.

798
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:41,710
The fate of our destruction
by a shattering off friends
IV breaking over our

799
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:42,644
heads.

800
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,380
So again, it's interesting
that this guy's, well, two
things I should point out.

801
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:50,831
Number one,

802
00:51:50,831 --> 00:51:54,130
it's interesting that this
guy's perspective because
he's in the staff and so he

803
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:57,610
sees more of what's happening
from the general officers.

804
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:03,040
But let's also make note that he's not
on the front lines and he's so he has it

805
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:07,420
relatively good,
meaning these protected by the,

806
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,670
by the rush from the Russians,
by some distance.

807
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:14,020
I mean he's still getting mortared,
etc. So getting artillery, but he's not,

808
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,170
he's not eye to eye with the Russians
like the guys like the soldiers on the

809
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:20,440
front lines that are sitting in a
little slit trench in the ground and the

810
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:24,460
Tundra. Hmm. One of the
things that he sees is a,

811
00:52:24,461 --> 00:52:26,070
is a meeting here we go back to the book.

812
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:28,900
An important meeting of the general
staff took place. At our core,

813
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,980
which the commander in chief of the army
general policy attended with his chief

814
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:33,730
of staff,

815
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,600
the serious reserved expression of the
tall figure with the head of a scientist

816
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:42,010
reflected something of a
burden of responsibility that
press down tormenting Lee

817
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:46,780
on the shoulders of this man who was
the last time I was to see how our army

818
00:52:46,781 --> 00:52:49,330
commander in the pocket.
As far as I can remember,

819
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:51,130
he never visited our core again.

820
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,730
I soon learned of the outcome of the
meeting and the grave words of our general

821
00:52:57,731 --> 00:53:02,050
staff officers left no doubt about the
consequences of the orders that have been

822
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:03,310
issued in the meantime.

823
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,420
Okay.

824
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,410
They dealt with the Mo mobilization of
the last reserves of the six the army,

825
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,880
the encircled forces were to
hold on and fight to the last,

826
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:14,500
yeah.

827
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,131
For this purpose,

828
00:53:15,131 --> 00:53:18,640
the formation of fortress battalions was
to be prepared and executed as quickly

829
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:19,474
as possible.

830
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,950
All remaining reserves of able bodied
men were to be collected in uses.

831
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,960
Infantry members of the WAFA ground
personnel and anti aircraft troops gunners

832
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:32,730
who no longer had guns. Pans are
granted years engineers, truck drivers,

833
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:33,541
clerical staffs,

834
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:38,370
rear echelon and supply personnel or
once again to be ruthlessly combed out,

835
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,710
the order of mounted to the
virtual disillusion of the
rear echelon services and

836
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:48,711
clearly demonstrated that the immobilized
army was doomed to stay put and fight

837
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:53,580
to the last man and the last bullet.
So there you go.

838
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:57,900
Everyone's going to fight cooks,
supply people.

839
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:03,180
You're all going to become an infantry
men now and this clearly indicates to a

840
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:06,630
weeder that that means they're not
going anywhere and they're going to stay

841
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:11,430
there. They're going to fight to
the last man back to the book,

842
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:15,690
we felt that we had already been written
off by the higher ups and all that

843
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:17,850
remained for us was to perform a heroic,

844
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:22,170
if futile gesture to ensure the
fulfillment of a the historic mission.

845
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:26,310
And he's got quotes around that of
the army of Stalin Grad on the vulgar.

846
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,300
The troops were again given
the cheering radio message,

847
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,380
which the fewer and supreme warlord
had sent at the turn of the year.

848
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,250
Six army has my promise that
everything is being done to get it out.

849
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,660
But we now viewed this
not just with doubt,

850
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,850
but as downright deception.
They don't believe Hitler anymore.

851
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,210
They used to just doubt him. Now. Now
they think he's deceiving them. And again,

852
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,410
this is not, this is no
small group people. Yeah.

853
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:03,230
Back to the book, the bread ration
was reduced to 50 grams per day,

854
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,890
ringing cold,
knowing Hong are creeping illness,

855
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:11,891
enemy fire combined in an indissoluble
offensive packed dysentery.

856
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:19,690
Typhoid fever had appeared as uncanny
guests and the plague of lice increased

857
00:55:19,731 --> 00:55:23,570
from day to day.
Death danced as murderers,

858
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,880
Rondo back and forth
throughout the pocket.

859
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,570
His headquarters where the numerous
places of suffering despair,

860
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:34,100
the dressing stations in field hospitals
that filled to overflowing alarmingly.

861
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:38,570
But he also felt at home on the lines
day and night. So death is everywhere.

862
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,990
Isn't it weird? You know, you
think like just being sick.

863
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,830
You were telling me you were sick a
couple of days ago. Common cool. Yeah.

864
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,920
And you think about what being sick does
to you and now this is your being sick

865
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:56,630
and it doesn't matter. Like there's no
mercy, you're, you're, there's no mercy.

866
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,710
Back to the back during back
the book during 50 days,

867
00:56:00,711 --> 00:56:04,430
that pocket battled lasted so far.
He, when he's talking about death,

868
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:07,670
he had already cleaned out
horribly among the men of the army.

869
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,300
About one third of its manpower was gone.

870
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:15,380
Of the more than 300,000 men who were
present at the time of the Russian

871
00:56:15,381 --> 00:56:19,220
breakthrough,
about 200,000 we're probably still alive.

872
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,040
And how many of these enduring and hoping,

873
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,220
fighting and suffering
human beings had deaf,

874
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,350
not already marked on his own

875
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,690
news that we could no
longer count on any relief.

876
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:41,040
Before spring was really shattering.
There was nothing more to be done.

877
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,070
Save to hang on and it door the horror.

878
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,810
Now we get a little opportunity here.

879
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,873
Here we go.

880
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,940
There was a surrender proposal sent to
our encircled army by the Soviet supreme

881
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:58,761
command.

882
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:03,080
The document was addressed to Paula who
had been promoted to colonel general and

883
00:57:03,081 --> 00:57:06,620
to all the officers and men of the
German forces fighting. It's stolen rod.

884
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:11,890
It was signed by Colonel General
of the artillery worn Varone off.

885
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,530
Yeah.

886
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:19,530
And by the commander in chief
of the forces of the Dawn
Front Lieutenant General

887
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,730
Rokos Wicki,

888
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:27,750
who had now obviously been put in sole
charge of all the forces surrounding us.

889
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,610
The proposal began with a short factual
and large the correct evaluation of our

890
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:35,830
situation. In particular, it's stress,

891
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:39,460
the catastrophic state of supply of our
troops who are suffering from hunger,

892
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,190
cold and sickness,
lack of winter clothing,

893
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,980
and terribly in sanitary conditions.

894
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:49,930
Realistic possibilities of breaking
the encircling ring no longer existed.

895
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,370
Any further resistance in such a
hopeless situation had to be senseless.

896
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,660
Therefore, in order to avoid further
unnecessary shedding of blood,

897
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:01,840
the Red Army was proposing
a number of terms.

898
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:07,000
The document ended with a
reference director to the
commander in chief of Stalin

899
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,610
Grad Army,
pointing out that in the event of refusal,

900
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:14,110
the forces of the Red Army and air force
would be obliged to destroy the pocket

901
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:18,910
for which he, Colonel General Paulus
would bear the responsibility.

902
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,200
You still got 200,000 people
and

903
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,000
you get an offer,
you get 24 hours to

904
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,820
respond. You basically
surrender everybody. Yeah,

905
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,290
everybody's going to surrender.
Yeah.

906
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,950
And and they weren't sure how
they were going to get treated.

907
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,960
I mean they were fairly confident,
wasn't be treated good. Uh,

908
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,030
hold on the whole though man.

909
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,930
It's all the dysentery treated very
good either that's not treating you very

910
00:58:51,931 --> 00:58:56,100
good at all.
Back to the book,

911
00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:00,660
we soon received various
orders, directives and
messages. Who's burden was that?

912
00:59:00,661 --> 00:59:03,570
The surrender was out of the question.

913
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,330
The commander in chief had passed
the Russian ultimatum onto the fewer

914
00:59:08,331 --> 00:59:11,690
headquarters and ask for freedom
of action for all eventualities.

915
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,920
It immediate reply hit the red personally
forbidden surrender and Paula said

916
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:20,810
rejected in writing the proposal,
the Soviet,

917
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,450
the troops were not informed
not to be informed in detail,

918
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:31,690
but from now on they were ordered to
fire without warning on flags of truth of

919
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:36,620
truce appearing near the front lines.
This instruction from army,

920
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:40,520
which we received by radio was especially
revealing as to the intentions of

921
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:43,040
leadership in our staff.

922
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,520
It was received with rejection at
objection because it was a clear breach of

923
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:49,360
international law so they don't get
told like, Hey, we're not spreading.

924
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:53,090
What they get told is if you
see anyone with flags, a truce,

925
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,110
shoot them immediately,

926
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:59,590
which is basically saying we're not
surrendering the back to the book.

927
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:03,170
I was reminded again of Hitler's high
sounding words about the invincibility of

928
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:06,710
the German soldier for whom nothing
must be seen to be impossible.

929
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,520
The very thought of capitulation
must be an irreconcilable,

930
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,240
must be irreconcilable with the
prestige of the supreme warlord.

931
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,870
He puts that in quotes every time I, I
don't call it out every time, but he does.

932
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,750
He's sorta mocking Hitler with that.
In his speech in Munich,

933
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:25,250
shortly before our encirclement,

934
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:30,050
he had had he not solidly sworn.
You may rest assured,

935
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:34,670
I repeat this with full responsibility
before God in history that we shall never

936
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:39,620
again leave Stalin Grad.
Never again for life or death.

937
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,390
We were committed to the cheerless.
Dawn's step here,

938
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,260
our fate must come full turn
the most terrible weeks.

939
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:51,650
We're still before us and
during those ICDs in January,

940
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:56,180
the fearful premonition of what was to
come descended upon us like a lead weight

941
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,650
on the morning of 10 January,

942
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:03,470
1943 exactly 24 hours after
the ultimatum had expired,

943
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:09,280
the Russian began the destruction of
the pocket with a hellish artillery

944
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:10,520
barrage.

945
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:16,420
It was the answer to the rejection of
the surrender proposal up upfront among

946
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:20,930
the staff's on the line. I again entered
the atmosphere of tension, excitement,

947
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,280
nervousness,
and despair.

948
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,910
The situation was partially
unclear and it confused the cat.

949
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:29,870
The catastrophe did indeed
appear to be unavoidable.

950
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,170
Okay.

951
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:35,670
Into this helpless situation. Orders
from army came in time and time again,

952
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:38,970
defend, hold, clear up the situation.

953
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,160
Fight to the last bullet,

954
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,660
okay.

955
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,890
From their desks,

956
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:49,020
2000 kilometers away and he puts in
parentheses and exclamation point,

957
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:55,040
the o k h together with the
constantly interfering fear,

958
01:01:56,071 --> 01:02:01,020
her fear or headquarters
forbade any independent
withdrawal from endangered from

959
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,710
endangered sectors of
the perimeter and army,

960
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:10,340
which had to meticulously justify itself
for any change in the front line caused

961
01:02:10,801 --> 01:02:15,480
by the pressure of circumstances. Obeyed
so does classic. It's micromanagement,

962
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,570
not decentralized command. They're
even saying, look, if your, if your,

963
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,390
if your is going to collapse,
don't fall back, just die.

964
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:26,700
Which is ridiculous because it doesn't
help the situation because now there's a

965
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,220
hole and now more,
more enemy.

966
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:31,740
You're going to come through the hole
and we're going to have people behind us.

967
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,360
Yeah. It's like full on kind of what
you were talking about last week.

968
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,630
Maybe it would be for last week. It's like
do it because I said so kind of thing.

969
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:42,030
Yeah like there's no really he is going
to die if there's no reason to do it.

970
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:44,100
No strategic reason.
They'll tactical reason.

971
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,990
Obviously it's do it cause I
said so. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah.

972
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:55,820
The army core divisions and regimens
obeyed often with bitter criticism,

973
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,150
criticism with open or hidden reservations
flaring up or knuckling under,

974
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:05,870
but they obeyed and the suffering and
dying of troops in the trenches and fox

975
01:03:06,401 --> 01:03:09,210
holes in the IC step obeyed,

976
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:14,540
giving their all in the natural
fulfillment of their duty or an apathy and

977
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:16,890
silent despair.

978
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:18,880
Okay.

979
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,170
The higher leadership did not
stint with recognition, promotions,

980
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,340
decorations and metals rain
down on mass on the fighting,

981
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:32,020
suffering doomed men.
But what purpose did this huge,

982
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:37,260
monstrous commitment and dedication of
human being serve in the face of the

983
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:43,361
increasingly help military helplessness
and the daily worsening human plight?

984
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,740
I was becoming more and more depressed
by the torturing question of the why of

985
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:53,090
this sacrifice of most precious blood.
This Pinellas dining

986
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:57,040
was it not only for the sake of,

987
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,160
of a prestige that a military supreme
command thousands of kilometers removed,

988
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:07,060
mercilessly wished to maintain then
for whom the price in many thousands of

989
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:10,510
human lives did not appear to be too high.

990
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,260
Okay.

991
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:17,260
This question haunted me and would
not leave me until the final sorrowful

992
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:18,283
ending.

993
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,670
So he's asking why

994
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:30,970
they start to collapse from the perimeter
of the pocket in towards the city of

995
01:04:32,151 --> 01:04:35,840
Stalin Grad you. Cause they were
kind of pushed out around it,

996
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:39,320
surrounding it and now they're starting
to fall back to it where they at least

997
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:41,690
have some coverage back to the book.

998
01:04:41,691 --> 01:04:45,380
The withdrawal of the troops finally
turned into a full fledged flight into

999
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:49,310
which further formations and combat
groups of various divisions were drawn.

1000
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Whole units cease to exist in this
confusion in the sector of our neighbor to

1001
01:04:57,891 --> 01:04:58,550
our left.

1002
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:03,550
This fate also put an end to a whole
division that had long been under our

1003
01:05:03,741 --> 01:05:07,450
command and in the end had
burned out like a slag heap.

1004
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:14,380
I saw it's distraught general
now a commander without
troops wandering around in

1005
01:05:16,011 --> 01:05:19,270
a bunker,
desperately seeking a new assignment,

1006
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:25,390
so he just lost 20,000 men.
He's walking around and saying,

1007
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:26,890
what am I supposed to do now?

1008
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:32,670
Back to the book and this desperate
withdraw was being carried out in icy cold

1009
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:38,311
weather and piddle a snow storms at
30 degrees centigrade below zero.

1010
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,560
That's negative 22

1011
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,790
at 30 degrees below zero.

1012
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:53,590
The remnant of the regiments that had
shrunk to combat groups and the suffering

1013
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:58,310
hordes of their shadow of other shattered
units moved over the empty white step.

1014
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:02,580
Staggering crowds, dragging,
dragging crowds of lost ha,

1015
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:05,530
lightly wounded and
frostbitten soldiers with them.

1016
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,430
How many of those that's
so far had been spared?

1017
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:14,610
Enemy fire succumbed there to exhaustion
and overexertion to the strains of

1018
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:16,240
hunger and to the cold.

1019
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:22,050
Innumerable men fell by the wayside and
we're soon mercifully cupboard over by

1020
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:23,794
the snow

1021
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,180
and this was no longer
an authorized withdrawal.

1022
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:33,880
The recoil of the front was now taking
place despite standing orders to hold and

1023
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:38,770
maintain position at all costs and despite
the line of resistance laid down by

1024
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:43,480
the okay. So they finally did
break and they finally said,

1025
01:06:43,481 --> 01:06:45,880
you know what?
Survival.

1026
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,880
This is about survival and
we're not staying here anymore.

1027
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:53,670
We're going to try and get
back, fall back. The cycle,

1028
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:57,910
the psychological ability of the troops
to resist it now also been eroded.

1029
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:04,110
There could no longer be any doubt about
our fate after the enemy had begun,

1030
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:06,700
has decisive attack,

1031
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:11,080
bent on destruction and our
disillusion was in full pro progress.

1032
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:15,190
It was too late for alas. Departure
attempt to break out to the west,

1033
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:20,470
help from outside could no longer be
considered more devastating even than the

1034
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:23,890
enemy's weapons were
hunger, exhaustion, cold,

1035
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:28,450
an illness of all kinds among the soldiers
who had not been adequately fed for

1036
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:30,070
so many long weeks.

1037
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:34,720
With the advent of the incredible
indescribable strains of daily retreats.

1038
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,440
The situation had deteriorated.
Catastrophic Lee,

1039
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:43,930
we were lacking in food
weapons, rest, warmth, hope.

1040
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:48,730
In short, we were lacking in all
the vital conditions for fighting.

1041
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:52,210
Since the long rejection
of the surrender proposal,

1042
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,490
the troops had again survived a long,

1043
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:58,300
terrible week of tenacious defensive
fighting, retreat and flight,

1044
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:02,290
thereby tying down superior and
our enemy forces in their area.

1045
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:03,761
Now,

1046
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:08,761
after the loss of our life support base
Patomic Nick airfield on January 16th

1047
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:12,610
the time really seemed to
have come to stop fighting.

1048
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,740
The airlift temporarily ceased together.

1049
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:16,890
Okay?

1050
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:21,890
No more food and ammunition and game in
the wounded and sick could no longer be

1051
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:26,650
flown out. And so that's where they're
getting their supplies into Pitt, Tom,

1052
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:27,540
nick air field.

1053
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:31,170
And that's actually where this guy
was for a large chunk of this battle.

1054
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:34,070
It's now gone. So now they even,
you know, before they were,

1055
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,820
they were only getting one
fifth of what they needed.

1056
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:41,040
Well now they're getting zero two
by now.

1057
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:45,360
Every day that the fighting was prolonged
was costing thousands of human lives.

1058
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:50,460
There was no more time to be lost and we
waited for something to happen like me,

1059
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,151
a numerable,

1060
01:08:51,151 --> 01:08:55,110
comrades and brothers and fate probably
clung to this same secret hope,

1061
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,490
but nothing happened.

1062
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:57,460
Okay.

1063
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,170
And tragedy took its course.

1064
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:01,973
Okay.

1065
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,960
The Russians,

1066
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:06,340
by using their storm troops during
the initial days of the offensive,

1067
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,380
it would probably have been very easy
for them to make a further effort and

1068
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:11,750
liquidate the pocket relatively quickly,

1069
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:18,250
but they no longer needed to make such a
highly costly attempt time was on their

1070
01:09:18,411 --> 01:09:22,550
side by bearing down on our tenacious
defense with a crushing attack,

1071
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:25,400
our enemy had won its
penetration into the pocket.

1072
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:30,370
Now he was no longer in a hurry and no
longer appeared to consider his victim to

1073
01:09:30,371 --> 01:09:31,600
be very dangerous.

1074
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:35,990
The battle that had begun in the meantime
was merely a question of finishing off

1075
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,740
wounded game already marked for death.

1076
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,310
Okay.

1077
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:44,480
For some time already, the Russians
had dictated the course of events.

1078
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:45,940
Okay.

1079
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,930
The date of our final end
depended on there. We'll alone

1080
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:57,370
the stations of the cross of
an army of 200,000 soldiers,

1081
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,260
particularly because of the slow,

1082
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:04,261
helpless death of such a vast number of
human beings made anything seen before

1083
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:08,140
with the exception of
Verdun Pale by comparison.

1084
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:09,450
Yeah.

1085
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:14,450
A part of the entire German nation was
sentenced to death here and buy this.

1086
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,180
It's vital substance was
dangerously under attack.

1087
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:23,160
The moral effect of these
events touched the whole nation.

1088
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:24,690
Okay.

1089
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:27,300
In the midst of the general
destruction of the army,

1090
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:32,540
there were thousands of individual
tragedies whose localities of horror where

1091
01:10:33,301 --> 01:10:37,080
the numerous collection points
for the sick and wounded.

1092
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,090
Okay.

1093
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:40,730
Whole convoys of mostly open trucks,

1094
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:45,380
overloaded with their pittable
freight of freezing wounded, groaning,

1095
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:48,290
sick and dying,
move deeper into the pocket,

1096
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:50,940
okay?

1097
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,670
From the second half of
January until the bitter end,

1098
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,590
the harsh suffering of the fighting
soldiers continued by day and night,

1099
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,110
okay.

1100
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:05,310
After eight evil weeks of
indescribable torture in deprivations,

1101
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:09,390
they were now plunged into a veritable
hell of hopelessness and destruction.

1102
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,080
Okay.

1103
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,780
Time and again it was fight, resist,
hold to the end than disengage.

1104
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:18,570
Withdrawal turned back and
dig in again for defense.

1105
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:22,230
In the snow and stone only hard
frozen earth time. And again,

1106
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:26,820
there were heavy losses, panic and flight
and the never ending useless struggle,

1107
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:31,200
struggle against hunger.
In cold among the staffs,

1108
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:36,470
there was an unending tension perplexity
and despair and feverish activity.

1109
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:41,970
Leadership was still to be seen
from the higher ha commands came,

1110
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:46,560
continue orders, directives,
questions, admonitions, threats,

1111
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:50,670
criticism, opposition and misgivings
were not lacking at the lower levels,

1112
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:53,760
but for the time being,
the mechanisms of command still function.

1113
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,100
So despite all this,
and even though they're having this,

1114
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,660
this hasty withdraw that's
going against orders,

1115
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:05,040
there's still art direction coming out.
There's still people being disciplined

1116
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,410
in the midst of the general
suffering and dying.

1117
01:12:10,411 --> 01:12:15,090
We helplessly watch the catastrophe of
destruction approaching us mercilessly.

1118
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:16,440
Inexorably.

1119
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,250
Yeah.

1120
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:22,180
The terrible human tragedy that was
nearing its climax was finally commented,

1121
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:27,190
commented upon by the war news broadcast
at home in the pretty and spirited

1122
01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:30,310
words,
quote in Stalin Grad,

1123
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:35,610
sixth army is attaching a mortal honor
to it's banners by it's heroic and self

1124
01:12:36,371 --> 01:12:39,460
sacrificing battle against crushing odds.

1125
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,753
Yeah.

1126
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:49,990
Many of my comrades had mentally written
themselves off intentions to commit

1127
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:52,840
suicide were voiced with
increasing frequency.

1128
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:57,400
Others had given their valuables and
wedding rings to be to the wounded being

1129
01:12:57,401 --> 01:12:58,330
flown out.

1130
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:00,610
Okay.

1131
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,020
I myself had been,

1132
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,970
had so far been at pains to prepare my
relatives for the catastrophe by means of

1133
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:08,110
sparse hints.

1134
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:08,900
Yeah.

1135
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:13,700
Now I felt the need descend home
open word of farewell and gratitude.

1136
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,740
Okay.

1137
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:20,200
The letter was hard to write in my ears.
Once more rang,

1138
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,820
rang the last goodbye.
My wife had imploringly in besieging,

1139
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:28,730
the called down the telephone line to
Kiev on a spring evening of last year

1140
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:32,720
before the seemingly endless
space of Russian planes.

1141
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:34,010
It's swallowed me up.

1142
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:36,530
Yeah.

1143
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:41,440
Now all would soon be over.
When I see all the letter,

1144
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,200
I was gripped by a specially deep despair.

1145
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,750
I felt as though I were suddenly
looking into an abyss of suffering and

1146
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:52,630
hopelessness towards which
our whole nation was reeling.

1147
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,910
As if the events and Stalin Grad,

1148
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:59,890
we're a preview of an immeasurable
disaster that was to break upon Germany.

1149
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:03,543
Okay.

1150
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:07,330
The general of this division
division had a nervous breakdown.

1151
01:14:07,331 --> 01:14:10,930
It was no longer fit for command.
His hopes of being flown out,

1152
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:14,320
the badly wounded and sick had
not been for four fulfilled.

1153
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,950
He now had to share the fate of
his soldiers to the bitter end.

1154
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:23,040
This general who is short time before was
a commander of a division head carried

1155
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:28,041
the responsibility for many thousands
of men was once more a mere human being

1156
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:30,580
trembling for his life.

1157
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:37,080
Then did his questions not reveal the
same fear that secretly tormented all of

1158
01:14:37,081 --> 01:14:37,914
us.

1159
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:44,060
We made one another realize that the
impending military catastrophe was also a

1160
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:46,380
political catastrophe.

1161
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:50,100
The result of presumptuous
beliefs and actions.

1162
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:54,930
The had long shaking. The healthy
foundations of our intellectual,

1163
01:14:54,931 --> 01:14:57,150
cultural,
and national life

1164
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:04,160
had the power that we served as citizens
and soldiers bent it's knee before the

1165
01:15:04,591 --> 01:15:09,591
law that was rooted in the code of
ethics or rather had not a new gospel of

1166
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:16,131
violence been proclaimed and introduce
that in a fatal reversal of all values

1167
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:21,930
had ceased to differentiate
between right and wrong.

1168
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:29,140
So these guys are realizing
what's coming around,

1169
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:30,790
what's coming around.

1170
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:35,500
He's realizing that the path that
they went down as a country was wrong.

1171
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:43,280
Back to the book by means of
destructive battle against the universal

1172
01:15:43,281 --> 01:15:47,900
educational and cultural
powers of classic antiquity,

1173
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:53,140
humanism and Christianity and
anti intellectual political
religion of power had

1174
01:15:55,521 --> 01:16:00,080
successively extracted the German people
from the best of the commonly held

1175
01:16:00,081 --> 01:16:05,081
European body of human fought and
thereby also out of any commitment to the

1176
01:16:05,901 --> 01:16:10,550
objective concepts of truth,
compassion and justice.

1177
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,610
Is that, is that his
conclusion, like during this,

1178
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:21,260
these events or, yes, during
these events, he's realizing what,

1179
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:26,710
what's happening is that they were
wrong and they went immediately.

1180
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:32,660
The thing that's crazy about Nazi
Germany is how fast that transition took

1181
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:36,450
place. It's like we're talking
10 years. What the rise of the,

1182
01:16:36,451 --> 01:16:39,880
not to rise the Nazis or they're
their, they're influencing that. Yeah.

1183
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,920
The rise of the Nazis just straight up
1933 they started now 1943 so we're 10

1184
01:16:45,531 --> 01:16:49,020
years and you have a completely
different viewpoint of the world. Yeah,

1185
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:55,130
that's great. I mean, they're
going against the see what?

1186
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,760
Like they're going against the traditional
values. They're going against, hey,

1187
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:00,890
you know, they're going
against the Christian values.

1188
01:17:00,891 --> 01:17:02,540
They're going against the cultural values.

1189
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:06,380
They're going against the national values.
Yeah. They're going against them. Yeah.

1190
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:11,300
It's, I wonder how much of is that,
you know, like the soldiers in the,

1191
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:15,380
even the people in the, in the Nazi party.
I wonder how much of it is like denial,

1192
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,520
you know,
you know where it's at.

1193
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,190
You know how like you're signed
onto like some leader during the,

1194
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:22,550
during the time being, yeah. Or you're
saying right now how much of this denial,

1195
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:26,750
no, no, no, no, no, no. During, during
the ride, remember rape and Dan,

1196
01:17:26,751 --> 01:17:28,820
can you remember that there
was one of the nicest guys,

1197
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:31,850
one of the guys who made the
biggest sacrifice was this
was a straight up actual

1198
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:36,500
Nazi and he made massive sacrifice and
took huge risks to save as many people as

1199
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:39,920
he could. By the way, not white
people, not Ariens but, but Chinese.

1200
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:43,610
So, so there's a guy that, you know,

1201
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:48,670
was more related to the traditional
Christian intellectual values.

1202
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:56,090
Right. And yet the, okay. The people that
are in charge of the country is Nazi.

1203
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:59,300
So I guess that makes me an oxy.
Yeah. And here we go. And so,

1204
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,240
and these guys war situation,
because there are soldiers,

1205
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:07,580
so now they're fighting for that
evil force. And like you said,

1206
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:08,450
there's some denial.

1207
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:12,740
You also get caught up and clearly the
Germans got caught up in the nationalism.

1208
01:18:12,741 --> 01:18:16,430
They got caught up with the Hitler was
a great orator and a very moving speaker

1209
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:19,340
and they got caught up in that and they
weren't in a very depressed economy.

1210
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:21,080
So those things all kind of came to head.

1211
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:25,790
They'd been in their mind screwed
over in World War One and you know,

1212
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:29,360
defeated and then treated badly.
And you know,

1213
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:31,650
there's this whole thing about
Hitler's mustache, you know,

1214
01:18:31,651 --> 01:18:35,990
Hitler has got the funny mustache.
Sure. And there's some debate on,

1215
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:39,350
on how much of this is actually true,

1216
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,770
but whether it's true or not as a
little bit, it doesn't really matter.

1217
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,790
But because of what it represents.
So the deal was that Hitler's mustache,

1218
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:50,810
if you wanted to have a mustache during
World War One because of wearing a gas

1219
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:53,090
mask,
you had to cut your mustache like that.

1220
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,670
Hitler still wars mustache like that.

1221
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:59,600
It was like a constant c
symbol that he remembered.

1222
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,100
He remembered because he was in world
war one and he was wounded in World War

1223
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:08,120
One and through even despite
all that insane sacrifice,

1224
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:13,040
they didn't win and they didn't like the
way they got treated by the treaty of

1225
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:16,520
Versailles. And so they have that
anx they had the economic angst,

1226
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:17,181
they had all those,

1227
01:19:17,181 --> 01:19:22,040
an angst built up and Hitler came along
and was ready to let them focus on

1228
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:25,640
something else.
And and now what,

1229
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:30,140
what weeder is realizing here is like
yeah he had us focus on something else.

1230
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:33,410
All right. And what he held had us
focus on wasn't good. It was evil.

1231
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,120
This is crude

1232
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:43,670
analogy
you to training day.

1233
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,110
I have watched training day.

1234
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,090
That's kind of the same thing when
you watch cause cause the new youth,

1235
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,870
the trainee, by the
way, when I see a movie,

1236
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:54,650
I see it like one time in an
airplane and I know I'm not,

1237
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:56,410
I'm not going to be
fully familiar with uh,

1238
01:19:56,670 --> 01:20:01,100
sort of pairing the rise of Nazi Germany
and the deaths of millions of people to

1239
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:02,060
the movie training day.

1240
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,620
And this is total speculation is just
what we're talking about as far as like

1241
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:08,220
you people that are signed on,

1242
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,450
Hey I'm German, you know, it's cool and
you know, we're all Jeremy, we weren't,

1243
01:20:11,451 --> 01:20:14,340
you know, solidarity where your and then
kind of the Nazi party starts rising,

1244
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:19,140
starts giving these sorta sort of certain
types of influence and they're like,

1245
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:22,620
oh all right, cool. I mean I wasn't
really thinking that but all right,

1246
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:22,981
we're still,

1247
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:26,160
Germans were cool and it starts
escalating and slowly it's like okay,

1248
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:29,670
you can't turn back it. That's what
happening. Training Gay, right? Yeah.

1249
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:32,550
Like he signed on, he signed on
and he's like Dang. He's like,

1250
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:34,170
I don't know about all this but all right.
Hey,

1251
01:20:34,171 --> 01:20:36,900
I'm signed onto the
cause and after a while,

1252
01:20:36,901 --> 01:20:41,220
which is the same point that this guy got
and got to where it's like, man, okay,

1253
01:20:41,221 --> 01:20:43,530
you guys pushed it too much,
man, I cannot sign onto this.

1254
01:20:43,531 --> 01:20:47,290
And then you reflect back on all
the violations, you know, like

1255
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:53,440
to slip. You start to slip when you
don't hold the line yesterday. Nothing.

1256
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:58,240
So that's what happens.
And that's what makes leadership hard.

1257
01:20:58,241 --> 01:21:03,241
That's what makes life hard is it's really
easy to get tempted to go down these

1258
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:08,320
trails, these paths that are
not what you should be doing.

1259
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,570
And you got to kind of amendment,
and it's hard because in the beginning,

1260
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,553
like

1261
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:17,990
you know you're, you're going down a
path you're already signed on, right?

1262
01:21:17,991 --> 01:21:21,190
And then you see one teeny tiny violation
and I was like, what am I going to do?

1263
01:21:21,191 --> 01:21:24,960
Like make this big stink about this
teeny tiny violation. Yeah, for sure.

1264
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:29,200
Then then you keep going and then
you had already made that exception.

1265
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,630
Time goes on. And what are you going
to bring that little thing up again?

1266
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:36,580
Psychologically?
What a Denzel Washington.

1267
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,990
He's, he's, he doesn't
introduce that he's,

1268
01:21:38,991 --> 01:21:41,230
and go straight to level eight violation.
Right.

1269
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,620
He just gives little little violations.

1270
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:48,420
Can you down the path, a little bit of
abuse there, but hey, we're fighting back.

1271
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:52,120
It's all good. And then like a
little like Wah, Wah, Wah, you know?

1272
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:55,850
Yeah, exactly. Right. And that's, that's
what, that's what Hitler did. Yeah.

1273
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,620
That's what Hillary started
with. Like, Hey, you know,

1274
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,490
we don't want to have this happening.
We've got to keep these things in check.

1275
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,590
Look, we're going to,
at least we're going to,

1276
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:06,140
we're going to put the Jews
in a neighborhood, right.

1277
01:22:06,141 --> 01:22:08,780
We'll put them in a separate neighborhood.
That way they're not amongst us. Right.

1278
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:11,300
Put them over there and didn't
know and it's okay. You know what?

1279
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,980
We're actually not going to be
to move moving somewhere else.

1280
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:15,440
Put Him in a work camp. Okay.
And then you just write,

1281
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:19,160
you slowly escalating before you're
murdering two, 6 million people

1282
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:24,340
and then all of a sudden what you're not
signed on all of a sudden you kind of

1283
01:22:24,341 --> 01:22:26,200
thing and you're like, Dang. In
your head, you're like, Dang,

1284
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:29,920
I was assigned on to some of the stuff
earlier, but I had let it go. I'm trapped.

1285
01:22:29,921 --> 01:22:30,630
You know,

1286
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:32,370
now you're trapped.
And that's where he is right now.

1287
01:22:32,371 --> 01:22:34,290
And He's trapped facing his death,

1288
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,840
recognizing that,
yeah,

1289
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:45,690
successively extracted the German people
from the best of the commonly held

1290
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:49,860
European body of human thought like
you saying exactly what you just said.

1291
01:22:49,861 --> 01:22:52,980
Success successively.
It's just a little bit at a time.

1292
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,100
Back to the book,

1293
01:22:56,101 --> 01:23:00,570
all of us who wore uniform war
entangled in a fabric of developments,

1294
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:04,140
in circumstances that we certainly
had not sought or desired.

1295
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,490
Now let's not make any excuses.
Let's not make any excuses,

1296
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:15,000
but we see how it kinda
happened as you just said. Yeah.

1297
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:19,540
We surely could not believe that our
employment here in Stalin Grad was part of

1298
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:23,980
a noble legitimate battle for
Germany and interests. Painfully.

1299
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,820
We felt that the soldierly virtues
of bravery, commitment, loyalty,

1300
01:23:27,821 --> 01:23:30,820
and obedience to duty
in the objective sense,

1301
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:36,030
we're being despicably misused this
deep and the tragedy of cruel events in

1302
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:42,370
which we now would have to atone
for much that we had never wanted.

1303
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:48,460
So yeah,
that's um,

1304
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:53,950
you know, I've heard that
argument sometimes if you,
well, you're going to kill,

1305
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:57,370
there's a bad regime and you're going
to go and you're going to attack the

1306
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:01,510
regime. And then some of the people
that are just there by chance, you know,

1307
01:24:01,511 --> 01:24:05,770
you hear that argument. Well, they're
allowing that regime to exist.

1308
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:11,280
Now that's a tough argument to have
because you got somebody for them to rebel

1309
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:15,240
could mean death and so they don't
get, they don't rebel. And so then,

1310
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:19,000
and put in a bad situation.
That's a tough one. Yeah, fully.

1311
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:24,000
But somebody asked me the other day,
so yeah,

1312
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:26,740
it's a long those lines,
you know,

1313
01:24:26,741 --> 01:24:31,260
some long winded question on Twitter
about what would you do if you are not in

1314
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:34,390
you, you know, in inside of a
state that was Bob all, you know,

1315
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,990
repressive and et Cetera, et cetera. No
holds a go. One word answer, rebellion.

1316
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:43,420
Now would I have the mentality that I
have right now if I grown up in one of

1317
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:44,710
those repressive states?
Probably not.

1318
01:24:44,711 --> 01:24:48,220
I'd probably just want to survive
and get some more bread. Yeah, right.

1319
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,560
I might not just be
thinking, Hey, there's,

1320
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:55,590
there's something more important than
me and that's freedom and it does it.

1321
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:59,680
Maybe I wouldn't think that. Maybe I'd
just be thinking, Hey, I want some,

1322
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,510
maybe I can get an extra 20
grams of bread. It Olga. Dang.

1323
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:09,370
All right.
Back to the book in this is good.

1324
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:12,370
In the proximity of death,

1325
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:16,000
things appeared in their
true light and proper order.

1326
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:21,700
In such a situation. The Bible speaks
to us with an insistence and clarity,

1327
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,540
the like of which we had never
felt or understood before.

1328
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:30,810
The fear and misery at the edge of
our existence had given us a religious

1329
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:35,230
experience who strength giving
power bound us together.

1330
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:36,840
Okay,

1331
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,280
so he's starting to see really
there's no atheists in a foxhole.

1332
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,170
Guess what?
According to Weeder,

1333
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,710
that's a very accurate statement.

1334
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:52,410
Among my favorite books in the little
private library I'd taken with me to the

1335
01:25:52,411 --> 01:25:57,210
eastern front was a copy of Marcus
Aurelius is self observations.

1336
01:25:58,210 --> 01:25:58,840
Okay.

1337
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:02,230
I too had often found
support and comfort in it.

1338
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:07,980
It had contributed markedly to completing
my equipment for war by serving me as

1339
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:13,631
a suit of armor that protected me from
all too frequent woundings by events and

1340
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:16,910
giving me an inner equanimity.

1341
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,250
Now,
this book too,

1342
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,360
like several others
had become meaningless.

1343
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:30,210
The wisdom of the world, the wisdom
of the world with it's merely human,

1344
01:26:30,211 --> 01:26:32,280
temporal comfort had failed.

1345
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:38,480
It did not penetrate into the ultimate
and most profound and could no longer

1346
01:26:39,121 --> 01:26:44,121
stand firm in the terrible shock and
helplessness whose mercy I felt myself to

1347
01:26:44,731 --> 01:26:49,731
be in in extreme distress with the
ground shaking under foot and a menacing

1348
01:26:50,491 --> 01:26:54,030
abyss of nothingness
seeming to open before me.

1349
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,490
There was only one last support,

1350
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:00,060
the comforting strength
of the Christian belief.

1351
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:06,940
Perhaps we could pass some of this comfort
and support on two other comrades who

1352
01:27:06,941 --> 01:27:07,721
bewildered.

1353
01:27:07,721 --> 01:27:12,721
We're wheeling toward the abyss in their
desperation faced with the destruction

1354
01:27:12,821 --> 01:27:14,320
of a whole world of concepts.

1355
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:18,220
In an a view of the senseless
senselessness of the catastrophe.

1356
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:22,660
Many a soldier on the staffs as well as
within the fighting troops had reached

1357
01:27:22,661 --> 01:27:24,940
for his pistol to put an end to his life.

1358
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:26,430
Okay.

1359
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:30,990
There was no way back and no escape other
disguise their secret fear and inner

1360
01:27:30,991 --> 01:27:35,991
feelings of emptiness behind a contrived
soldierly stance or even deliberately

1361
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:40,460
assume to the cast of
mind of a language neck,

1362
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:46,950
which is like these guys were these
old school German mercenaries that were

1363
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:51,900
super hardcore. If they themselves
were doomed to go under,

1364
01:27:51,901 --> 01:27:55,530
they would at least sell their skin
so dearly to the end and take as many

1365
01:27:55,531 --> 01:27:58,410
Russians with them as they
could. That's interesting. He's,

1366
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:03,440
he's projecting on these
soldiers that you know,

1367
01:28:04,561 --> 01:28:06,450
that they're disguising their secret fear.

1368
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:10,620
You know what I'm telling you right now,
that some of those Nazi German soldiers,

1369
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:14,490
they were, they were getting
after it, right? They weren't,

1370
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:18,570
they weren't hiding their,
their secret fear by acting tough.

1371
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,730
They were ready to die for the fewer.
Hmm.

1372
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:25,860
So let's not just paint with a
broad brush there. In my opinion.

1373
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:33,630
If uh, we agreed that suicide was out of
the question for religious and ethical

1374
01:28:33,631 --> 01:28:34,464
reasons.

1375
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:38,640
As normal week human beings
caught up in error and guilt,

1376
01:28:38,641 --> 01:28:40,260
there was nothing left to,

1377
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:45,620
to us put to drink the cup of
suffering to the last bidder drags.

1378
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:54,010
Yeah. In the meantime,
something unbelievable. It
happened and made quickly made.

1379
01:28:54,011 --> 01:28:55,490
The rounds are quartermaster.

1380
01:28:55,491 --> 01:28:58,480
A still young general staff
officer had suddenly disappeared.

1381
01:28:58,481 --> 01:29:03,030
His driver who had taken him to the
gum rack air had waited in vain for his

1382
01:29:03,031 --> 01:29:07,030
return. The lieutenant colonel was
missing. He had silently left Stalin.

1383
01:29:07,031 --> 01:29:09,060
Rod left the Stalin Grad pocket,

1384
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:12,180
the zone of death and destruction
on his own initiative.

1385
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,970
Probably it was a mixture of nerves,
fear,

1386
01:29:14,971 --> 01:29:18,720
cowardice in the vain hope that in the
general confusion he might be able to fly

1387
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:21,840
out and save his life that
attempted him to dessert.

1388
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:26,460
The commanding general had made inquiries
by radio that earning staff officer

1389
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:30,120
had shown up at army group claiming the
flown out on official assignment from

1390
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:31,800
the core on matters of supply.

1391
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,370
Our general was wild with
indignation and rage.

1392
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:39,240
He declared that he would
have the criminal flown back
into the pocket and shot

1393
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:40,410
before our eyes.

1394
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,330
We were all deeply depressed and into
with an anticipated with horror the

1395
01:29:45,331 --> 01:29:49,980
terrible scene that had been announced
and which we were spared to our relief.

1396
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,090
Our quarter master was shot outside the
pocket on the spot where in his fatal

1397
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:58,710
weakness he had hoped to find a
door to freedom in life. So again,

1398
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:03,090
even though I just talked about some of
the Nazis being committed to the end,

1399
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,690
there was many of them that were just
trying to get the hell out of there.

1400
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,040
Back to the book, our commanding general
spoke openly of the impending collapse,

1401
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:16,770
accusing lean with
bitterness and secret anger.

1402
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:20,870
He pointed out that it was not our fault.
We had gotten into this devil,

1403
01:30:20,871 --> 01:30:25,080
this situation of a catastrophe from which
there was no longer a means of escape.

1404
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:29,730
Okay? Here he is, the commanding
general is now saying,

1405
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:31,830
hey look,
this is not our fault.

1406
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:37,740
So he so clearly, he's
obviously not taking any
ownership of this, but w w okay,

1407
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:41,670
so it's only ask you this.
Okay, Jocko, what would it,

1408
01:30:41,671 --> 01:30:45,090
how would it help him if he was to
take ownership of it right now? Right.

1409
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,180
If he was to say, Hey, this is my fault.
It wouldn't help them. Could, could.

1410
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,850
If he was to say, Hey, look, this is
my fault. This is why this happened.

1411
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:56,340
Would that help him right now? No,
you're right. It wouldn't help them.

1412
01:30:56,450 --> 01:31:01,260
What did have helped him a month or
two months ago, if he said to himself,

1413
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:04,860
look, we're in this situation, I need to
take ownership of it and get it fixed.

1414
01:31:04,861 --> 01:31:07,950
Would it have helped? Then you're
damn right. It would have who said,

1415
01:31:07,951 --> 01:31:09,500
you know what?
Hitler might not tell them.

1416
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:12,840
It might be telling us not to break
out. Guess what? Hitler's not here.

1417
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:17,820
We're going to break out. I'll go get
shot for defying his orders. That's fine.

1418
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:22,110
I'll save all of you. That's, that's
where ownership would've come in,

1419
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:24,750
but what he said was, look, we're, we're,
we're, we're assigned to our faith.

1420
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:25,980
I talk about this all the time.

1421
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:29,100
Just because the boss tells you or doesn't
give you the support that you need or

1422
01:31:29,101 --> 01:31:31,830
gives you a bad order.
That doesn't give you the excuse.

1423
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,010
You can't put the ownership on the
boss and you're the one in charge.

1424
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:40,050
You take ownership of it, you get the
problem solved. He didn't do that. So he,

1425
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:43,860
he's, I don't want to see allowed
to say it's not our fault,

1426
01:31:43,861 --> 01:31:45,510
but he okay.

1427
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:50,520
Him saying it's not our fault is
kind of a different circumstance.

1428
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:55,080
Why? Because they're past the point of no
return. If they're doomed already. Yes.

1429
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:56,910
Cause they don't have any, uh, you know,

1430
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:01,570
take responsibility and then take
responsibility for the fixing the mistake.

1431
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,780
There is no fixing the mistakes
anymore. That's why if I was him, yeah,

1432
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:08,230
I would've said, hey guys, it's not your
fault that you're here. This is my fault.

1433
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:12,280
I should have made a maneuver. I should
have stood up to the boss. I didn't.

1434
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,370
Here's what we're going to do now to
defend ourselves the best of our ability.

1435
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:16,391
Right.
Right.

1436
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:21,391
So then that would still give
the guys some breathing room.

1437
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:25,540
Right. Some psychological breathing
room. Yeah, they fought hard.

1438
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:27,940
They did their best. It's my fault.
I should have. I should have.

1439
01:32:27,941 --> 01:32:29,710
How'd you guys do something
different and I didn't.

1440
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,130
Here's what we're going to do
now. The fact that he, that these,

1441
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,290
that he wasn't taking ownership earlier,

1442
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:40,210
the fact that he's able to blame now
means he was able to blame earlier and if

1443
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:42,460
you're, the minute you start
blaming, you're not solving anything.

1444
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:45,220
You're not getting things
done. There you go. Yeah,

1445
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:48,581
back to the book,

1446
01:32:48,581 --> 01:32:51,880
but he left no doubt that together
we still had a task to perform,

1447
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:56,500
namely namely to fulfill our soldierly
duty duty til the last moment in

1448
01:32:56,501 --> 01:32:58,150
obedience to the orders from above.

1449
01:32:58,151 --> 01:33:02,110
We will defend our perimeter fighting
shoulder to shoulder with our carbines to

1450
01:33:02,111 --> 01:33:04,120
the last bullet from his words,

1451
01:33:04,121 --> 01:33:07,900
we could surmise that he was staunchly
determined to go down like a captain with

1452
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:12,430
his ship and not to survive the
downfall of his troops on equivocally.

1453
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:16,690
He pointed out that the commandments
of the traditional ethical code of the

1454
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:20,800
soldier now demanded our
ultimate sacrifice without Demir.

1455
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:26,070
Okay.

1456
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:31,070
Now at this point he's supposed to go out
and do a do like a Rocana sense of the

1457
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:35,340
lines and see what's going
on and when he's up there.

1458
01:33:35,341 --> 01:33:38,970
Here's what he sees in freezing
cold and wild snow fury flurries,

1459
01:33:38,971 --> 01:33:42,390
I wrote across the decile at battlefield
on a motorcycle together with a

1460
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:46,440
sergeant of the military police,
we soon reached a road of catastrophic.

1461
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:51,510
We soon reach the road of catastrophe
or rising dark gray against the backdrop

1462
01:33:51,511 --> 01:33:55,620
of a snow bounce step marked by
all kinds of abandoned rubbish.

1463
01:33:55,621 --> 01:33:58,710
Half covered cadavers of
horses and wrecked vehicles,

1464
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,700
scattered pieces of equipment,
crates destroyed weapons,

1465
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:06,540
the dispersed, the starving,
the freezing, the sick,

1466
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,880
but all those still fit for fighting.

1467
01:34:08,881 --> 01:34:12,630
Had only one objective to which they
were attaching their last glimmerings of

1468
01:34:12,631 --> 01:34:13,200
hope.

1469
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:17,700
And this objective was stolen Grad in the
protective walls of the sellers of the

1470
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:21,870
ruins. They might still be able
to find some warmth, food, rest,

1471
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,850
sleep and salvation.

1472
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:29,070
And so they streamed by the remains of
the shattered and decimated formation

1473
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:34,310
trains and rear echelon services with
vehicles that were slowly being dragged

1474
01:34:34,471 --> 01:34:39,320
and pushed by wounded, sick and
frost bitten men. There were a May,

1475
01:34:39,321 --> 01:34:43,590
she did figures among them
muffled and coats rags,

1476
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:46,860
pitiful rex,
painfully dragging themselves forward,

1477
01:34:46,861 --> 01:34:50,670
leaning on sticks and hobbling all
along the fruit on frozen feet,

1478
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:55,940
wrapped in wisps of Straw and strips
of blankets drifting along through this

1479
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:57,980
storm.

1480
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,750
This was the wreck of the sixth army that
had advanced to the vulgar during the

1481
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:04,430
summer.
So confident of victory,

1482
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:09,530
men from all over Germany doomed
to destruction in a far off land.

1483
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,930
Mulian during their suffering.

1484
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:17,200
Tottered in pitiful drove droves
through the murderous eastern winter.

1485
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:22,220
These were the same soldiers
who had formerly marched
through the large parts of

1486
01:35:22,221 --> 01:35:24,170
Europe's as proud conquerors.

1487
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:29,660
Now the enemy was at their backs
and deaf looked everywhere.

1488
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:40,800
There's an interesting piece
that I don't go into too much,

1489
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:45,801
but this guy had written a paper and
presented it up the chain of command with,

1490
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:51,360
uh,
talking about what happened to Napoleon.

1491
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,573
Hmm.

1492
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:56,190
And he got kind of told like, hey,
that's not going to happen to us.

1493
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:00,450
Back to the book, the events of 1812 seem
to be repeating themselves after all.

1494
01:36:00,451 --> 01:36:01,141
Once again,

1495
01:36:01,141 --> 01:36:05,520
the uncanny Russian space was swallowing
many tens of thousands of human beings

1496
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,270
despite Napoleon's experience.

1497
01:36:07,271 --> 01:36:12,271
The basic elements of geography and
meteorology had again been ignored to a

1498
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:14,370
frightening degree.
On top of that,

1499
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:18,420
the modern superstition that with
the help of machines and motors,

1500
01:36:18,421 --> 01:36:22,980
the possible could be accomplished and
the dangers of space overcome had also

1501
01:36:22,981 --> 01:36:27,981
contributed to our downfall and it a
fatal pack with the overestimation of

1502
01:36:28,021 --> 01:36:32,640
mechanized means of bore had stood the
misapprehension of the limits of human

1503
01:36:32,641 --> 01:36:36,870
strength and possibilities. Yeah. Repeat

1504
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:40,800
Tizzy. Yeah. That was another
one of those classic lines.

1505
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:43,940
That's not gonna happen to us. Oh
yeah. I mean it feels like, yeah,

1506
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:48,090
that's a classic mistake.
It's called ego called lack of humility.

1507
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:52,710
Don't worry, that won't happen to us. It
happened to Napoleon, one of the greatest,

1508
01:36:52,711 --> 01:36:53,940
you know,
military leaders of all time.

1509
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,400
But it won't happen to us
because we have some cars. Yeah,

1510
01:36:56,820 --> 01:37:00,660
we've got some tanks or whatever,
but by the way, tanks, tank, fuel,

1511
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:04,230
where's that fuel going to come from?
I mean,

1512
01:37:04,231 --> 01:37:09,020
at least a horse can eat a piece
of Hay, right? Sure. You know,

1513
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:15,180
there's no Exxon station
out there on the steps

1514
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:19,050
back to the book together
with several wounded,

1515
01:37:19,051 --> 01:37:21,720
we dragged ourselves onwards
until exhausted in shattered.

1516
01:37:21,721 --> 01:37:25,590
We finally reached the ruins of rubble
of northern Stalin Grad City area,

1517
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:29,730
so now he's actually was retreating
back to Stalin Grad itself.

1518
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:34,200
What travails did fate
still hold in store for us?

1519
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:38,620
Deaf who might face more often and
closely in recent days than ever before,

1520
01:37:38,621 --> 01:37:42,540
it was still refusing me,
but his trusted companion for many weeks,

1521
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:45,270
hunger was tormenting
me with tenacious power.

1522
01:37:45,271 --> 01:37:48,970
Slowly making me write
for the end and frost.

1523
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:53,940
The third murderer in the trio had
also bitten me by now as the constant

1524
01:37:53,941 --> 01:37:58,860
stabbing pains. Some of my limbs
warned me separate from our staff.

1525
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:02,790
Our Group of officers found shelter and
a dark dirty seller while our men went

1526
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:05,610
to ground in a neighboring
pile of rubber rubble.

1527
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:10,020
This was to be the end of our
flight and our last quarters.

1528
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:16,750
The army had once again
addressed itself too. Okay.

1529
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:21,610
H and pointing adamantly to
the catastrophic situation
had asked for immediate

1530
01:38:21,611 --> 01:38:22,780
permission to surrender.

1531
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:24,210
Okay.

1532
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:28,530
Which might possibly prevent
still complete disillusion,

1533
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:32,340
disillusion,
and total disaster.

1534
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,150
Hitler's answer had been a steely no

1535
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:42,000
for bid surrender. Hitler had radioed
into the pocket on 25 January.

1536
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:46,470
The army will hold its position
to the last man and bullet.

1537
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,430
Okay?

1538
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:51,890
Imagine being that freezing hungry,

1539
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,700
tortured by the enemy at your back.

1540
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:59,930
And you got some guy in
a nice,

1541
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,393
ridiculous,

1542
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:08,950
it's one thing to be like, yeah, we're
going to the last minute, the last bullet,

1543
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:13,930
and it's this big war, but it
lasts. You know, I don't know,

1544
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,030
a week not even though
we eat or like that,

1545
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,970
that one big last stand and we're gonna
fight to the death. That's one thing.

1546
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:20,620
And I dig it and that's,
you know,

1547
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:26,280
but just weeks and weeks and weeks of to
slowly dying of starvation in sickness

1548
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:27,851
in this way,

1549
01:39:27,851 --> 01:39:32,680
different it's way different to try to
fight til the last man in the last bullet

1550
01:39:32,681 --> 01:39:34,030
in that sentence scenario.

1551
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,210
Yeah.
Especially because they,

1552
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:41,160
they all kind of know that there's no
strategic advantage to what they're doing.

1553
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,083
In worse.

1554
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:49,260
Back to the book Colonel General Policy
and his chief of staff who's fanatical

1555
01:39:49,261 --> 01:39:53,820
wheel to hold out was well known among
the staff's relentlessly held onto their

1556
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,130
fatal decision on their part.

1557
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:59,580
Many generals and their staffs remain
the executioners of the orders of

1558
01:39:59,581 --> 01:40:02,820
destruction under the sorry
circumstances for fighting,

1559
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:07,910
suffering and dying continued torturing
Lee and terribly after the splitting of

1560
01:40:09,061 --> 01:40:13,500
the pocket. The death agony of the
army continued for a further week

1561
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:18,030
in the general disillusion
and catastrophe.

1562
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:23,360
It was every man for himself more and
more order and discipline broke down here

1563
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:28,500
and there and the sellers.
This still able bodied in combat,

1564
01:40:28,501 --> 01:40:33,501
worthy hid among the second wounded cases
of uncommon rod really conduct theft

1565
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:38,700
of provisions, refusal to obey
orders and open mutiny mounted

1566
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:42,913
a little late.

1567
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:49,060
The elementary drive of self preservation
no longer allowed the question of

1568
01:40:49,061 --> 01:40:54,010
right or wrong to be raised and in the
same way that the differences between the

1569
01:40:54,011 --> 01:40:58,090
front line and rear line ash,
then the rear echelon we're being erased.

1570
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:03,100
So were the differences in rank
and position. In the final days.

1571
01:41:03,101 --> 01:41:07,270
Summary Law was imposed and stolen Grad
with drastic punishments for any crime.

1572
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:10,030
Looters were to be shot within 24 hours.

1573
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:14,410
Hundreds of German soldiers who had
become weak in their misery thus became

1574
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:16,930
victims of German bullets.

1575
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:18,430
Okay.

1576
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:22,150
One could no longer generally speak
of courageous and heroic fighting.

1577
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,680
Certainly here and there there
were individual deeds of courage,

1578
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:29,890
personal initiative and noble self,
self sacrifice,

1579
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:31,870
but by and large,

1580
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:37,510
only a mute submission to the inescapable
fait remained to the bitter end.

1581
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:38,840
Yeah,

1582
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:43,840
it was rather the silent hero wisdom of
acceptance of suffering and submitting

1583
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:53,310
not the picture that gets painted
very often. Now at this point,

1584
01:41:53,370 --> 01:41:58,370
at this point right now in this battle
is when they hear that speech that goring

1585
01:42:00,911 --> 01:42:01,111
said,

1586
01:42:01,111 --> 01:42:05,190
talking about this great sacrifice and
how they fought so well and how they'll

1587
01:42:05,191 --> 01:42:10,191
be remembered forever and compared them
to Leah [inaudible] and the 300 Spartans

1588
01:42:12,721 --> 01:42:17,310
at Thermopylae. It's just, and
here's what these guys thought

1589
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:25,230
with overexaggerated feverish PAF us
the see the speaker recalled the heroic

1590
01:42:25,871 --> 01:42:29,170
example of the last of the goths,
and in the end, the historical,

1591
01:42:29,171 --> 01:42:33,820
so famous sacrifice of the Spartan
heroes at Thermopylae who had not fall

1592
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:36,910
faulted or given ground until
the last fighter had fallen.

1593
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,670
And so it was at Stalin Grad,

1594
01:42:39,671 --> 01:42:42,700
just like Leah nighties and his
loyal men and the Greek defile.

1595
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:47,860
So with the German heroes lie on the
vulgar as the law of honor and conduct in

1596
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:50,020
war commanded them to do for Germany

1597
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:56,770
during this speech full of empty
phrases and lies that outdated itself in

1598
01:42:57,351 --> 01:43:02,351
hysterical glorification and praises the
demeanor of the deeply delusioned and

1599
01:43:02,631 --> 01:43:05,600
incensed.
Adios became more and more hostile.

1600
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:06,980
Yeah.

1601
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:07,850
The glances,

1602
01:43:07,851 --> 01:43:12,851
gestures and words all around
on mistakenly showed the
rage that was growing in

1603
01:43:12,981 --> 01:43:14,180
people's souls.

1604
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,980
Whoever might still have trusted in the
promise of help from the outside now had

1605
01:43:18,981 --> 01:43:23,030
to recognize with growing horror that
at home where relatives still hope for a

1606
01:43:23,031 --> 01:43:26,810
union. The warriors of Stalin
Grad had finally been written off.

1607
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,110
Okay.

1608
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:32,490
We felt that we had heard our own
funeral oration before its time.

1609
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:38,510
The disgusting adulation of the torture
is dying of our army and the deceitful

1610
01:43:38,511 --> 01:43:43,511
glorification of conditions that were
against all laws of humanity filled me

1611
01:43:43,521 --> 01:43:46,760
with indignation and revulsion.

1612
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:53,330
Must not going w goings words if pierce
the hearts of our loved ones at home

1613
01:43:53,331 --> 01:43:56,810
like daggers and rob them of all hope
now that they had been thrown into the

1614
01:43:56,811 --> 01:44:00,320
most anxious fears of art
for our lives at home,

1615
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:01,910
we had been declared dead.

1616
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:08,930
The hero is Asian and
mythical glorification of
our stolen Gratta army was

1617
01:44:08,931 --> 01:44:13,931
supposed to conceal the
sad truth for a long time.

1618
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:17,990
Now the our relic tale of the German
soldier drama vulgar had become an

1619
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:21,860
irresponsible mass dying
ordered from on high.

1620
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:28,840
The pathetic propaganda of glorification
was obviously intended to distract from

1621
01:44:29,361 --> 01:44:34,361
the catastrophic consequences of a
criminally amateurish leadership of war.

1622
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:38,690
And to prevent the question
of blame from even a rising.

1623
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:44,063
Okay.

1624
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:48,370
So you pretty much see how
these guys felt at the end.

1625
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:56,370
And now you might think you might think
that there's a disconnect between Hitler

1626
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:00,731
but cape,

1627
01:45:00,731 --> 01:45:04,150
we're proud we're fighting to the end
and this is the way the Germans are and

1628
01:45:04,151 --> 01:45:05,950
this is the way we are.
We are superior.

1629
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:07,133
Hmm.

1630
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:09,410
And that the guys on the ground
that they're just beat down.

1631
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,560
And so maybe they're just,
maybe they're just weak. Right.

1632
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:17,570
And they're just given up. You might
think that you might think that here's,

1633
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,460
this will give you a
little indication that,

1634
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:23,600
that that's the wrong
thought on the one February,

1635
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,370
the new spread among us,

1636
01:45:25,371 --> 01:45:30,371
that Paula's had capitulated with his
staff and the two southern segments of the

1637
01:45:31,041 --> 01:45:34,850
pocket and gone into captivity.
So the leader just surrender.

1638
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:39,580
At the last moment he had been
promoted to field marshal.

1639
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:43,780
This promotion in the hour of the
final catastrophe was grotesque.

1640
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,630
It was simply a gesture of
thanks from above and a good buy.

1641
01:45:47,950 --> 01:45:52,450
So Hitler thought the policy was
going to die. Well, he didn't

1642
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:59,250
Paulus surrendered,
but the unhappy field,

1643
01:45:59,251 --> 01:46:03,330
Marshall Marshall did not set the example
of heroism expected of him from the

1644
01:46:03,331 --> 01:46:07,340
top. The German papers
broadcasts later broadcast,

1645
01:46:07,341 --> 01:46:10,800
Slater tried to spread the impression of
the style of goring speech that in the

1646
01:46:10,801 --> 01:46:12,840
face of overwhelming superiority,

1647
01:46:12,841 --> 01:46:17,130
the field marshal had burned his secret
papers and that the general line behind

1648
01:46:17,131 --> 01:46:19,110
their machine guns had fought to the end.

1649
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:20,390
Okay.

1650
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:22,550
Furthermore,
after the catastrophe,

1651
01:46:22,551 --> 01:46:26,030
German magazines lied to the
German people with fake pictures,

1652
01:46:26,031 --> 01:46:28,100
so showing such heroic scenes,

1653
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:29,480
okay,

1654
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,910
but the truth of the matter
was something quite else.

1655
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:36,200
We calculated that more than 15
generals and their staffs had gone into

1656
01:46:36,201 --> 01:46:39,920
captivity from the southern and
central pockets soon mosque.

1657
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:44,030
Soon the Moscow radio gave
details of numbers and names.

1658
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:48,050
I was only to learn later that some of
these generals had gone into captivity

1659
01:46:48,051 --> 01:46:52,230
with neatly packed suitcases
and plentiful baggage.

1660
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:57,260
They simply stopped fighting and gave
themselves up to the victor without any

1661
01:46:57,261 --> 01:47:00,650
further consideration for the fate
of the remaining battle groups.

1662
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:05,780
The last request of the field marshal
had been that the Russians should treat

1663
01:47:05,781 --> 01:47:09,630
him as a private citizen.
With this,

1664
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:12,930
he had resigned at the official role,
either formally played in the military,

1665
01:47:12,931 --> 01:47:15,540
political interest of
the supreme commander,

1666
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:19,380
and as a broken man laid
down his martial ship,

1667
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:25,290
he was driven away in a closed car and
no longer needed to see the appalling

1668
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:27,360
misery of his sacrificed army.

1669
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:31,893
Yeah,

1670
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:35,900
so there's no disconnect. The
troops on the ground, we're right.

1671
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:40,490
These leaders were liars week

1672
01:47:42,730 --> 01:47:45,190
and they had no problem.

1673
01:47:46,930 --> 01:47:47,763
Okay.

1674
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:51,100
Pursuing glory with someone else's ass,

1675
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:53,590
but they weren't ready
to do with their own.

1676
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,260
Deep down inside,

1677
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:03,540
I had increasingly begun to oppose
certain military concepts of obedience,

1678
01:48:03,541 --> 01:48:04,650
honor and discipline,

1679
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:09,630
like those that had been
manifesting themselves to
the end in the measures taken

1680
01:48:09,631 --> 01:48:14,240
by our command. Was this
only the, so this is,

1681
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:17,420
this is a week we went through
all this and he's like the only,

1682
01:48:17,421 --> 01:48:20,930
now he's starting to
oppose some of some of his,

1683
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:23,420
his military concepts of obedience.

1684
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:26,660
If this was was an American,

1685
01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:31,100
do you Americans are rebellious by
nature like we don't, we don't. You know,

1686
01:48:31,101 --> 01:48:33,950
if you, if you're leading us down the
wrong path, we stand up and say like, no,

1687
01:48:33,951 --> 01:48:36,680
you're not going to do that. Stop. No,

1688
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,470
he's, you know, here going, well,

1689
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:44,850
they've done all this and know now am
I starting to question these things?

1690
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:49,770
And he even questioned his question back
to the book was this only the revolt of

1691
01:48:49,771 --> 01:48:54,660
my selfish instinct for self preservation
was an omission on soldierly stance,

1692
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:58,170
fear of cowardice at a time when
things had become bitterly serious.

1693
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:01,620
Precisely at this point,
I again remember the awkward,

1694
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:06,120
deeply penetrating faults and feelings
with which I'd asked myself at the

1695
01:49:06,121 --> 01:49:10,080
beginning of the war. Why and for
whom must you make this sacrifice?

1696
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:15,640
The same questions that had never
really taken root roads again before me,

1697
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:20,850
gigantic Leanna and applicable to the
whole army was there really unknowable.

1698
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,000
Hi,

1699
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,710
holy objective at stake here and
solid Grad our in our battle,

1700
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:32,100
an ethically justified goal which could
be served by ultimate human human test

1701
01:49:32,591 --> 01:49:34,060
of giving one's life.

1702
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:40,380
Did soldierly honor and obedience to
orders really justify this demand so

1703
01:49:40,571 --> 01:49:44,500
casually made of us that we
hold out for this lost cause,

1704
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:46,780
this excess of suffering and dying.

1705
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:52,020
Was this immeasurables sacrifice really
decisive for the outcome of the war and

1706
01:49:52,331 --> 01:49:54,670
could it serve our country and our people?

1707
01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:03,800
This is what this is. You want to know
why we talk about the wire all the time?

1708
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,390
Yeah, there it is. Yeah.

1709
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,470
Now he should have been asking that
question a long time ago and he said he

1710
01:50:09,471 --> 01:50:12,200
started to, in the beginning he
started to ask that question,

1711
01:50:12,201 --> 01:50:14,780
but he didn't go through with it. You
know why? Because they were winning.

1712
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:19,670
They were winning. Dz Don't really need
to know why, where I could go out there,

1713
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:23,660
you know, beat this country, beat that
country, roll through that country.

1714
01:50:23,690 --> 01:50:26,810
It's pretty easy not getting tested.
Yeah.

1715
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:31,910
Back to the book of foreboding, I had
long held, grew into a terrible certainty.

1716
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:36,630
What was happening here in Stalingrad
was a tragic, senseless self sacrifice,

1717
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:40,760
a scarcely credible betrayal of the
final commitment and devotion of brave

1718
01:50:40,761 --> 01:50:43,190
soldiers are innocent.

1719
01:50:43,191 --> 01:50:47,180
Trust had been misused in the most
despicable manner by those responsible for

1720
01:50:47,181 --> 01:50:51,860
the catastrophe. We had been
betrayed, led astray, and condemned.

1721
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:58,010
The men of stolen Grodd were dying in
betrayed belief and in betrayed trust in

1722
01:50:58,011 --> 01:50:58,611
my heart,

1723
01:50:58,611 --> 01:51:03,611
the bitter feeling of and all for nothing
became ever more torturing in my soul

1724
01:51:05,601 --> 01:51:06,411
arose again.

1725
01:51:06,411 --> 01:51:11,411
The whole a bismal disaster of the
war itself more clearly than ever.

1726
01:51:11,661 --> 01:51:16,070
I appreciated the full measure of misery
and wretchedness of the other countries

1727
01:51:16,071 --> 01:51:16,701
in Europe too,

1728
01:51:16,701 --> 01:51:20,800
which German soldiers and German arms
had brought boundless misfortunes.

1729
01:51:20,801 --> 01:51:23,030
So he's reflecting and he's looking
around and saying, look what we did.

1730
01:51:23,031 --> 01:51:25,460
All these other countries.
How do we,

1731
01:51:25,461 --> 01:51:30,440
not so far the Victor's been all too
prone to close our eyes and our hearts and

1732
01:51:30,441 --> 01:51:34,790
to forget that always an everywhere.
The issues we're living,

1733
01:51:34,791 --> 01:51:38,840
human beings, their possessions and
their happiness. So, like you said,

1734
01:51:38,841 --> 01:51:41,510
he turned a blind eye.
He rolled through all these countries.

1735
01:51:41,511 --> 01:51:42,830
He did all that evil.

1736
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,860
Probably only a few among
us had entertained the fault
that the suffering of the

1737
01:51:48,861 --> 01:51:53,720
thought that the suffering
and dying being caused by our,

1738
01:51:53,721 --> 01:51:58,010
sorry, profession of war would
one day be inflicted upon us.

1739
01:51:59,390 --> 01:52:04,390
We had carried our total war into
one region of Europe after another,

1740
01:52:04,491 --> 01:52:09,491
and thereby destructively interfered
with the destinies of foreign nations far

1741
01:52:11,061 --> 01:52:14,060
too little.
We had asked the reason why,

1742
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:19,790
the necessities and justifications for
what was happening or reflected on the

1743
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:22,820
immeasurability of our
political responsibility,

1744
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:28,060
that these entailed misery and
death had been initiated by us,

1745
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:33,970
and now we were inexhaustibly coming
home to roost day were in exorbitant,

1746
01:52:35,301 --> 01:52:36,440
coming home to roost.

1747
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:42,040
The step on the dawn and the vulgar had
drunk streams of precious human blood.

1748
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:49,410
The Russians were certainly also making
cruelly high blood sacrifices in the

1749
01:52:49,411 --> 01:52:51,120
murderous battle of Stalingrad,

1750
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:56,040
but they who were defending their
country against a foreign aggressor knew

1751
01:52:56,041 --> 01:53:00,990
better than we why they were risking
their lives. So yeah, the Russians,

1752
01:53:00,991 --> 01:53:02,670
they're fighting,
they're dying for sure,

1753
01:53:02,671 --> 01:53:04,410
but they know that they're
defending their homeland.

1754
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:06,240
It's a lot easier for them to understand.

1755
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:13,200
Many officers and commanders now began
to oppose the insane orders and emanating

1756
01:53:13,331 --> 01:53:16,600
from the fewer headquarters and
being passed on by army command.

1757
01:53:16,601 --> 01:53:17,580
By this they had,

1758
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:21,980
they began to reject the long eroded
military concepts of honor and discipline

1759
01:53:21,981 --> 01:53:26,860
to which the army leadership at clung
until the end in the unconditional

1760
01:53:26,861 --> 01:53:31,390
obedience, such, such as was fatally
being upheld here in Stalin Grad,

1761
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:36,310
there was no longer a soldierly stance,
but rather a lack of responsibility.

1762
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:40,660
So I'm gonna say that one more time.

1763
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:45,700
This idea that
unconditional obedience was,

1764
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:50,110
was, was not seeing right
now as a soldierly stance,

1765
01:53:50,111 --> 01:53:54,910
but a lack of responsibility because
you are responsible to do something if,

1766
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:59,260
if you're getting bad orders,
you're responsible for not obeying them.

1767
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:02,680
And you know, I get asked this question
all the time, not all the time,

1768
01:54:02,681 --> 01:54:05,560
but you know, sometimes
people say, what if you got,

1769
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:08,470
what did you do if you ever got told
something that you didn't believe it?

1770
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,500
I was like, well, we
were home the same page.

1771
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:16,390
Like it's not like we were getting
told to do things that were immoral,

1772
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:18,550
unethical. You're, they
weren't saying, Hey,

1773
01:54:18,551 --> 01:54:22,920
go burn this village with
women and children. We weren't
getting those orders. He,

1774
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:24,970
you know what I mean?
We weren't getting told to do things that,

1775
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:26,553
yeah,

1776
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:29,780
that weren't,
that I didn't agree with that.

1777
01:54:29,781 --> 01:54:33,770
That my guys didn't agree with and
that's the way the mill are there.

1778
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:37,070
Are there pockets where things
happened? Yeah, absolutely. That's what,

1779
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:38,660
that's the horrors of war.

1780
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:43,760
But if we got told to do things that we
didn't think we should do, we just said,

1781
01:54:43,761 --> 01:54:44,930
no,
not doing it.

1782
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:45,893
Hmm.

1783
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,720
This was open mutiny.

1784
01:54:51,470 --> 01:54:54,980
So they've gotten to the point now flying
me since they were no more orders from

1785
01:54:54,981 --> 01:54:56,120
the center towards the end.

1786
01:54:56,121 --> 01:54:59,570
Many responsible commanders and unit
leaders on the line acted on their own

1787
01:54:59,571 --> 01:55:03,140
initiative and in an endeavor to
stop the senseless shedding of blood.

1788
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:07,910
Many desperate Stalin Grad warriors in
the end sought a way out by suicide or by

1789
01:55:07,911 --> 01:55:10,940
voluntary,
by a voluntary soldiers death.

1790
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:15,380
We learned of two generals who extremes
who's extreme resolution had been

1791
01:55:15,381 --> 01:55:16,191
shattering.
One,

1792
01:55:16,191 --> 01:55:20,330
the commander of a division from Dresden
had shot himself after having ordered

1793
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:23,870
his son, a young lieutenant, to
report to him to say farewell.

1794
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:25,873
The other,

1795
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:29,990
the commander of a division from Lower
Saxony who's tactical emblem was a four

1796
01:55:29,991 --> 01:55:33,800
leaf clover and was known therefore as
the lucky division who did not want to

1797
01:55:33,801 --> 01:55:34,281
survive.

1798
01:55:34,281 --> 01:55:38,690
The downfall of his men had been killed
on the frontline while standing erect

1799
01:55:38,691 --> 01:55:39,920
and firing his weapon.

1800
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:50,240
The last pockets of resistance,

1801
01:55:50,241 --> 01:55:54,770
what was left of about six shattered
divisions and the remnant of other

1802
01:55:54,771 --> 01:55:58,610
formations that had meanwhile been left
to their fate by the resignation of the

1803
01:55:58,611 --> 01:56:02,900
army command now had to bear the whole
burden of the concentrated air attacks,

1804
01:56:03,170 --> 01:56:04,880
artillery and mortar fire.

1805
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:11,570
It was not only the
fear of the coming end,

1806
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:15,470
the hunger clawing at my intestines
and the pain from my frozen limbs that

1807
01:56:15,471 --> 01:56:19,730
turned the last seemingly endless hours
and the Stalin Grad pocket into the

1808
01:56:19,731 --> 01:56:21,260
tortures of Hell for me.

1809
01:56:22,610 --> 01:56:27,610
The proximity of death toward the last
obscuring veils from my eyes and brought

1810
01:56:28,731 --> 01:56:33,050
fruits of long years of individual
experiences, observations,

1811
01:56:33,051 --> 01:56:36,980
tormenting feelings and thoughts
into an instant maturity.

1812
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:38,580
Yeah.

1813
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:43,580
Now on the very edge of
being war in it's for us,

1814
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:45,590
okay,

1815
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:50,590
most terrible form became the
inexhaustible revealer of all things,

1816
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:58,770
but he's going through like spiritual
awakening as he faces death in my mind's

1817
01:56:59,361 --> 01:56:59,661
eye,

1818
01:56:59,661 --> 01:57:03,680
the horrible experiences and pictures of
destruction that would not leave me in

1819
01:57:03,681 --> 01:57:04,940
peace.
By Day or night.

1820
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:09,590
We're strung together in a bloody
chain experiences and impressions,

1821
01:57:09,591 --> 01:57:13,760
stretching foreign to the past. That's
suddenly a woke in my sharp and memory.

1822
01:57:13,761 --> 01:57:17,900
I discovered to be logically
connected links of this fatal chain.

1823
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:23,420
What had formally always caused me to
have nasty premonitions and apprehensions.

1824
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,460
What it always disquieted me,

1825
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:30,640
I now suddenly had a recognized as
having been the warning of a fatal

1826
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:35,840
fundamental evil.
The dimensions of which I had fought,

1827
01:57:35,870 --> 01:57:37,550
not fought possible

1828
01:57:46,340 --> 01:57:50,330
now faced with the eminently
impending catastrophe.

1829
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:55,220
The question about the sense of what was
happening had played me so often during

1830
01:57:55,221 --> 01:57:57,800
the war,
seized me again with cruel force.

1831
01:57:57,980 --> 01:58:02,870
Hundreds of thousands of flowering human
lives were suddenly being senselessly

1832
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:04,790
snuffed out here in Stalin Grad.

1833
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:10,100
What an immeasurable wealth of
human happiness. Human plans,

1834
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:12,800
hopes,
talents for tile.

1835
01:58:12,801 --> 01:58:17,240
Possibilities for the future were
there by being destroyed forever.

1836
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:18,540
Okay.

1837
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:23,540
The criminal insanity of an irresponsible
war management with it's superstitious

1838
01:58:25,261 --> 01:58:29,130
belief in technology and it's
utter lack of feeling for the life,

1839
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:33,840
value and dignity of man
and here prepared for us.

1840
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:35,760
Oh Hell on earth.

1841
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,160
How could the

1842
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:44,980
long eroded concepts of honor,
duty,

1843
01:58:44,981 --> 01:58:49,240
obedient soldierly hair wisdom
figure any longer into our feelings,

1844
01:58:49,241 --> 01:58:52,780
thoughts and actions to stay alive,

1845
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:56,770
to be reunited once again
with our loved ones at home.

1846
01:58:56,771 --> 01:59:01,180
This burning desire was now the drive
behind all thoughts and actions.

1847
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:06,850
Gradually we had accustomed
ourselves to the,

1848
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:11,880
to the idea of surrendering at the
first opportunity and going into Russian

1849
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:15,040
captivity.
In the end,

1850
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:20,340
I basically had only one wish to stay
alive and healthy and go into captivity on

1851
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:24,870
wounded.
So that's it goes into captivity.

1852
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:28,710
Um, you know, after going through a, uh,

1853
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:33,060
I don't know if you want to call it a
spiritual awakening of recognizing that

1854
01:59:33,061 --> 01:59:38,061
his whole life had been
doing something evil.

1855
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:43,200
Yeah.
In the end it's,

1856
01:59:43,201 --> 01:59:47,600
it's pretty anticlimactic how it happens,
how they get,

1857
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:50,330
how they end up in captivity.

1858
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:53,360
Back to the book in the
early minutes of captivity,

1859
01:59:53,361 --> 01:59:57,260
I felt an easing tension and relief.
In the end,

1860
01:59:57,261 --> 02:00:01,760
the insecurity of our situation between
life and death had weighed down on all

1861
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:02,840
of us,
like led

1862
02:00:05,420 --> 02:00:07,070
what first attracted my attention.

1863
02:00:07,071 --> 02:00:09,380
So now they're captured in what
first attracted my attention.

1864
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:14,750
Imagine this was the fresh
healthy appearance of the victors.

1865
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:19,600
They're simple enviable winter
clothing in good weapons, son,

1866
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:23,900
sub machine guns everywhere.
And the uniform picture of sheep skins.

1867
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:29,050
Padded jackets felt boots and for caps
with broad earmuffs swinging up and down

1868
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:32,510
the warmly bundled up,

1869
02:00:32,511 --> 02:00:37,160
well nourished and splendidly equipped
men of the Red Army with their chunky,

1870
02:00:37,161 --> 02:00:41,620
mostly red cheeked faces formed
a stark contrast to our death.

1871
02:00:41,621 --> 02:00:42,540
We Pale,

1872
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:47,680
filthy bearded and freezing figures of
misery who Hong exhausted and sick and

1873
02:00:48,201 --> 02:00:52,520
their makeshift winter clothing
consisting of all kinds of furs, blankets,

1874
02:00:52,521 --> 02:00:57,110
scarves, field gray, head gear,
woolens and inadequate foot gear.

1875
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:03,950
This sudden meeting and comparison at
once showed me how low we had sunk and how

1876
02:01:04,561 --> 02:01:07,770
little we had been prepared
for this murderous battle

1877
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:11,853
than the Soviets.

1878
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:16,510
The Russians kind of
have their shots at him.

1879
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:19,480
Fritzy Fascist Hitler caput.

1880
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,920
They alternated threats
and obviously dreadful.

1881
02:01:23,921 --> 02:01:28,921
Kurt curses and contemptuous spit like
raging wolf to vengeful soldiers from the

1882
02:01:30,521 --> 02:01:35,470
rear echelons fell on the helpless victims
time and time again to steal personal

1883
02:01:35,471 --> 02:01:37,540
baggage and to vent their spleen.

1884
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:43,070
So now they're captured in though the
Russian start to kind of sing and dance

1885
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:47,000
and singing the old folk songs

1886
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:49,521
back to the book.

1887
02:01:49,521 --> 02:01:54,440
All the noise and exuberant surrounding
me formed a shrieking contrast to the

1888
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:55,490
inner and outer state,

1889
02:01:55,491 --> 02:02:00,491
which I found myself torn from my
circle of comrades left to myself and my

1890
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:01,491
emotions.

1891
02:02:01,491 --> 02:02:06,140
In the midst of the joyful dancing and
singing victors with whom no contact

1892
02:02:06,141 --> 02:02:10,910
could be established in my inner heart,
I felt abandoned and without hope,

1893
02:02:11,150 --> 02:02:14,840
totally depressed, uprooted,
caught off from home,

1894
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:18,590
sunk far away,
subjugated to a foreign will,

1895
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,800
pytest sleep piteous Lee thrown to
the mercy of an unknown powers to be

1896
02:02:25,821 --> 02:02:30,470
dependent on the whim of the
victor constantly watched
menacingly surrounded by

1897
02:02:30,471 --> 02:02:35,000
barbed wire and guns forced to relinquish
to any kind of external freedom

1898
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:35,991
captivity,

1899
02:02:35,991 --> 02:02:40,991
men on an unknown form of human
submission and humiliation.

1900
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:46,863
Okay?

1901
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:52,300
It is a bounty for us human beings that
a merciful hand covers the future from

1902
02:02:54,771 --> 02:02:57,680
our eyes with an impenetrable veil.

1903
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:00,170
That's a really great line.

1904
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:06,790
Had I known then that I was destined
for more than seven comfortless years

1905
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:13,210
devoid of love and filled with previously
unknown mental and physical tortures

1906
02:03:13,551 --> 02:03:17,330
and fearful uncertainties
on the borderline of life.

1907
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:20,780
I never would have found
the strength to say Stan,

1908
02:03:20,781 --> 02:03:24,380
the sufferings of the initial
hard months of captivity.

1909
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:28,820
He's saying if he would've known what
the future held seven years he's about to

1910
02:03:28,821 --> 02:03:29,930
be in captivity for,

1911
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:36,630
he wouldn't have even made it through.
He would have given up

1912
02:03:39,150 --> 02:03:44,150
and he doesn't talk in
this book about what that

1913
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:48,930
imprisonment was like,

1914
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:55,160
but he does give what I
think is a combination of how
we survived it and what he

1915
02:03:56,461 --> 02:03:59,880
learned from it.
Going back to the book time and again,

1916
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:05,660
I was soothingly distracted
from my tormenting thoughts
and dark visions by the

1917
02:04:05,911 --> 02:04:10,911
wonders of the brightly shining star
filled winter sky that appeared to be so

1918
02:04:10,921 --> 02:04:12,330
close to the touch.

1919
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:18,220
It constantly drew my eyes upwards as
if by magical force what its so far

1920
02:04:18,871 --> 02:04:23,430
appeared to me as the downfall of a
world come loose at the seams and a

1921
02:04:23,431 --> 02:04:28,431
catastrophe without bounds suddenly
took on measurable dimensions.

1922
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:35,870
I regained my equilibrium and found my
way back to myself where I felt earlier

1923
02:04:37,951 --> 02:04:40,650
that chaos was swallowing me up.
Now,

1924
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:44,250
calm and peace was flowing
into my disquieted heart.

1925
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:50,780
The reconciling effect came from the vast
order and harmony that the sparkling,

1926
02:04:51,391 --> 02:04:56,391
massive bright stars with their eternal
laws of the universe brought back to my

1927
02:04:56,521 --> 02:04:57,840
attention.
A new

1928
02:04:59,980 --> 02:05:00,813
okay.

1929
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:04,920
The constellation that the stars sank
into my soul was strange and hardly to be

1930
02:05:04,921 --> 02:05:06,600
grasped by the intellect.

1931
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:12,810
It seemed to me as if my personal fate
within the framework of events on earth

1932
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:18,270
was secretly included within the vast
all embracing order of the cosmos

1933
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:23,890
for the massive survivors who had
escaped from the hell of Stalin Grad.

1934
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:28,090
The aftermath of the tragedy
lasted only for a short while.

1935
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:29,670
Yeah,

1936
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:34,140
they died in their tens of thousands
during the early months of captivity.

1937
02:05:35,190 --> 02:05:36,750
Hunger and deprivation,

1938
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:42,260
frost and sickness had already made them
assure pray for death even before the

1939
02:05:42,691 --> 02:05:46,740
fighting stopped
with the columns of prisoners.

1940
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:51,980
Deaf also came to the various camps of
reception where terrible app epidemics

1941
02:05:52,531 --> 02:05:57,531
raged everywhere and exact accounting of
the victims of Stalin Grad according to

1942
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:03,360
numbers, dates, and individual
fates will never be made.

1943
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:09,590
The few that were allowed to begin a new
life at home and in freedom after long

1944
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:11,280
years of captivity,

1945
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:16,140
we'll always have to ask themselves
how they can justify the deaths of the

1946
02:06:16,141 --> 02:06:18,390
others by their own existence,

1947
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:23,190
how they can uphold and fulfill
the legacy of their dead comrades.

1948
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:27,990
But all Germany must also
loyally remember, it's many,

1949
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:33,230
many sons that lie at rest in the distant
Russian step and try today and in the

1950
02:06:34,921 --> 02:06:38,850
future to understand they're
unforgettable. Sacrifice

1951
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:43,180
the new broom ball mounds of soldiers,

1952
02:06:43,181 --> 02:06:46,180
graves and stolen Grodd
have long disappeared.

1953
02:06:47,110 --> 02:06:47,490
Okay.

1954
02:06:47,490 --> 02:06:52,050
The cemeteries were leveled soon after
the battle and partially converted to

1955
02:06:52,051 --> 02:06:53,340
soccer fields.

1956
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:54,910
Yeah.

1957
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:58,900
Nothing is left of the army
of simple gray crosses,

1958
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:04,510
but it is as if a great invisible cross.

1959
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:09,780
We're rising there on the Volga
casting its shadow over our nation and

1960
02:07:12,641 --> 02:07:17,170
addressing penetrating admonishing words.

1961
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:18,890
Okay.

1962
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:20,780
To all of our hearts.

1963
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:28,283
And that

1964
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:33,960
closes out this book with

1965
02:07:37,330 --> 02:07:38,350
with some

1966
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:46,390
penetrating in admonishing words a for
us because there's a lot of warnings

1967
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:51,260
in this book.
Warnings that

1968
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:55,850
we must pay attention to

1969
02:07:59,730 --> 02:08:01,950
and if we don't pay attention to them,
then who will?

1970
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:03,853
Yeah,

1971
02:08:04,070 --> 02:08:08,380
warnings. The lessons here,
first of all, as a nation,

1972
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:15,280
as a culture, we have to look at
the way things fell apart in Germany

1973
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:21,980
or maybe you look at the way things came
together slowly like we talked about,

1974
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:27,250
the traditional values were we're moved
aside and they were replaced with these

1975
02:08:27,681 --> 02:08:28,550
new values,

1976
02:08:28,610 --> 02:08:33,380
values that allegedly
protected the German citizens.

1977
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:36,220
Yeah,

1978
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:39,760
they were values that we're going
to make the world a better place

1979
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:45,100
and he uses this term,
this political religion.

1980
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:48,380
That's a powerful thought.

1981
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:49,353
Okay.

1982
02:08:50,590 --> 02:08:55,590
Political religion took hold and then
he used that term presumptuous beliefs

1983
02:08:57,191 --> 02:09:02,191
that countered the foundation of
their existing cultures and beliefs.

1984
02:09:03,370 --> 02:09:05,950
So there's some arrogance involved
that we have people that aren't even

1985
02:09:05,951 --> 02:09:08,060
listening to the counter arguments.

1986
02:09:10,510 --> 02:09:15,510
I think we have to be
careful not to abandoned

1987
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:25,040
the structures of the past in some kind
of a race to move to the future because

1988
02:09:25,411 --> 02:09:26,244
the future,

1989
02:09:26,610 --> 02:09:31,610
it hasn't been tested by thousands and
thousands of years of human evolution.

1990
02:09:34,291 --> 02:09:35,340
And I understand,

1991
02:09:36,820 --> 02:09:37,540
okay

1992
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:39,390
that we,

1993
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:44,860
I'm not saying we don't progress,
but I'm not saying we don't evolve,

1994
02:09:44,861 --> 02:09:48,820
but I'm saying you don't bow
down and you don't submit.

1995
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:57,670
You got to think about the direction
that we're heading. And as citizens,

1996
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:58,421
as people,

1997
02:09:58,421 --> 02:10:03,421
we have to have the courage to stand up
before we reached the event horizon from

1998
02:10:04,181 --> 02:10:05,050
which there's no return.

1999
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:13,740
So now on a smaller level,
the lessons from this book as,

2000
02:10:13,741 --> 02:10:14,280
as a,

2001
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:19,280
as a person in business or in the military
or in any team as a subordinate and

2002
02:10:19,711 --> 02:10:21,060
we're all subordinate to someone,

2003
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:27,510
we have to question our leaders and,
and I say that all the time.

2004
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:29,530
Yeah.

2005
02:10:29,530 --> 02:10:32,370
If we don't agree with that plan
or don't agree with a tactic, you,

2006
02:10:32,371 --> 02:10:35,240
you've got a question leadership
when you got out, raise your hand.

2007
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:40,270
But if we know that the intent
of our leadership is malevolent

2008
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:48,180
or it's going to cause suffering,
human suffering on a grand scale,

2009
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:49,350
on a minor scale,

2010
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:51,890
okay,

2011
02:10:51,890 --> 02:10:52,940
you have to,

2012
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:57,740
we have to say no and do what is right.

2013
02:10:57,741 --> 02:10:59,990
No matter the consequence,

2014
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:05,140
no matter the consequence

2015
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:11,090
and
you don't.

2016
02:11:11,190 --> 02:11:16,190
Finally for us as individuals,

2017
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:19,953
okay,

2018
02:11:20,130 --> 02:11:23,370
we got to remember that we are
in charge of our own lives.

2019
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:29,850
We are leading our own lives and
where are you leading yourself?

2020
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:36,460
What are you doing that you
know you shouldn't be doing?

2021
02:11:36,461 --> 02:11:38,200
Why are you doing that?

2022
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:43,420
What attached roughy
are you heading toward?

2023
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:51,580
You don't have to be heading
towards that catastrophe.

2024
02:11:51,581 --> 02:11:55,630
You have the opportunity to prevent
catastrophe in your own life.

2025
02:11:55,631 --> 02:11:58,870
But in order to do that, once
again, you have to stand up.

2026
02:11:58,871 --> 02:12:00,760
You have to do the right thing,

2027
02:12:03,980 --> 02:12:06,590
you have to be comfortable.

2028
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:13,900
You have to impose the discipline on
your own life so you don't have something

2029
02:12:16,731 --> 02:12:17,990
else imposed,

2030
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:23,020
something bad in posts so you don't have
a catastrophe imposed on your own life.

2031
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:32,700
Because when we avoid the discomfort and
when we avoid the discipline and when

2032
02:12:32,701 --> 02:12:36,510
we avoid doing what we know
is the right thing to do,

2033
02:12:36,511 --> 02:12:40,560
that's when you end up in a personal
catastrophe, in your own personal hell,

2034
02:12:40,561 --> 02:12:43,590
in your own personal stolen Grotte

2035
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:49,913
you have to do.

2036
02:12:51,250 --> 02:12:51,740
Yeah.

2037
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:55,220
The hard thing,
the thing you know is right.

2038
02:12:56,970 --> 02:13:01,970
And do you know what is right and
you know what you are supposed to do.

2039
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:08,370
So do it
and avoid

2040
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:14,490
going down a path
that leads

2041
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:17,633
yeah.

2042
02:13:17,710 --> 02:13:22,000
To your own personal health
and instead,

2043
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:23,740
yeah.

2044
02:13:23,740 --> 02:13:26,350
Get on the path that leads

2045
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:29,553
to freedom.

2046
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:32,943
I think

2047
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:38,910
that's all I've got for tonight's.
So Echo.

2048
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:41,520
Speaking of doing the right thing.
Sure.

2049
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:45,630
Maybe you could give us some ideas,
um,

2050
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:49,560
on how we can,
you know,

2051
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:54,650
continue down the right path doing what
we know we're supposed to do. Sure, sure.

2052
02:13:57,240 --> 02:14:00,000
The part where you said,
you know,

2053
02:14:00,001 --> 02:14:04,470
you're less likely to raise any questions
or you're more likely to turn a blind

2054
02:14:04,471 --> 02:14:07,410
eye when you're winning.
You remember when you said that,

2055
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:12,210
that like on them we use boiler room.
Am I wrong? No, no, no, you're right.

2056
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:15,540
Yeah.
So the guys,

2057
02:14:15,541 --> 02:14:19,020
there's a part where he's in there
waiting to go to a party or something,

2058
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:21,750
you know, they're, they're selling
stocks, right? And they're,

2059
02:14:21,751 --> 02:14:25,620
they're like garbage stocks or whatever.
Inflating them. Yeah. They're like, yeah,

2060
02:14:25,621 --> 02:14:28,650
all this pump and dump.
Yeah.

2061
02:14:29,370 --> 02:14:33,360
And so they're in the car going to
some party and he's like, hey, it was,

2062
02:14:33,361 --> 02:14:38,040
who was it, Giovanni, whatever
the actors' names. Are they
a, he's like, Hey, he goes,

2063
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:42,270
do you ever wonder how, how we get these
big commissions on these? You know?

2064
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:46,170
And he's like, that's the wrong question
to ask. You know? He's like, wait,

2065
02:14:46,171 --> 02:14:49,620
what do you mean? He's like,
he's like, just, just don't
ask that question. Basics.

2066
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:52,230
He said, don't ask that question. He goes,
don't you like the way things are going?

2067
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:55,800
He's like, yeah, but I do. I do, but
don't you ever wonder? He's like, no,

2068
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:59,280
I like being a millionaire. Same
exact thing. When you're winning,

2069
02:14:59,281 --> 02:15:04,050
it's easy to turn the blind eye,
you know? Good point. Yeah, man.

2070
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,110
So, I mean, I guess
that can apply to, well,

2071
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:10,050
it's interesting that you point
that out and I think that, um,

2072
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:14,310
like on a personal level, right? Let's
say you're doing really good. Yeah.

2073
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:17,550
It's then it can be tricky for
people to do the right thing to,

2074
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:22,610
cause that's why we see like these a
celebrity like movie stars or celebrities,

2075
02:15:23,010 --> 02:15:27,090
athletes or whatever. Man,
they do some dumb stuff, right?

2076
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:29,610
They do some dumb stuff because they're
winning. They're thinking they're good.

2077
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:32,780
They can do whatever they want.
They make the wrong choice. Yeah.

2078
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:37,580
You dinner on the evening news doing
dumb stuff that ruins them. Yeah.

2079
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:42,360
And I mean their own personal stone,
God puts him in hell. Yeah. Even, yeah.

2080
02:15:42,361 --> 02:15:45,630
With money too, you know, you know,
like in celebrity types and you know,

2081
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:47,190
athletes who you are and just people,

2082
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:51,210
people who get a good job with
their business blows up or whatever.

2083
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:53,910
Yeah.
Any,

2084
02:15:54,390 --> 02:15:58,080
any type of winning we could look at it
doesn't mean you're necessarily doing

2085
02:15:58,081 --> 02:16:00,390
the right thing. It's harder. My point is,

2086
02:16:00,391 --> 02:16:02,160
and I think you're saying the same thing.
Yes.

2087
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:06,000
It can be harder to do the right thing
when you're winning because you just

2088
02:16:06,001 --> 02:16:09,690
think you're good to go. You get
arrogant. Yeah, yeah, let's not,

2089
02:16:09,691 --> 02:16:13,800
let's not put brakes on this training
here. Just let it all fly kind of thing.

2090
02:16:14,130 --> 02:16:17,310
And then when the train kind of
loses momentum, meanwhile, all those,

2091
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,620
those things that you've been ignoring,
they're still there. You know?

2092
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:21,840
Look at your empty bank account.

2093
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:24,090
You spent all that money
you're supposed to keep.

2094
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:27,020
It would be for you made money or
money. You were budgeting, right?

2095
02:16:27,030 --> 02:16:29,010
You're budgeting, you're surviving,
you're budget and you're doing,

2096
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:31,180
you started making all this.
When he started spending all this money,

2097
02:16:31,690 --> 02:16:36,280
all the money stopped coming in and your
budget is God just saying that's what

2098
02:16:36,281 --> 02:16:38,410
happens. Sometimes. You can't happen.

2099
02:16:40,210 --> 02:16:43,420
Also pay now or pay later. I remember that
one. That was a good one that you said.

2100
02:16:44,830 --> 02:16:47,920
Yeah. Did I say that? Yeah.
Pay Now or pay later. We're,

2101
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:50,930
I think we're talking about like
working out or something. Just like,

2102
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:54,760
I didn't say it today though. No, no,
no, no. Pay Now or pay later for sure.

2103
02:16:54,761 --> 02:16:58,000
Stuck with nonetheless
support. Yeah. For sure.

2104
02:16:58,030 --> 02:17:03,030
Hundred percent good way to
avoid going down your personal,

2105
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:05,260
I don't know. Maybe it does.
Maybe it doesn't. It nonetheless,

2106
02:17:05,261 --> 02:17:08,270
if you're in the mood to support and
listen your own personal style and rob.

2107
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:13,330
Yeah, right. But I dunno why supporting
would like prevent that, you know,

2108
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:17,120
you're not. No, we go deep for,

2109
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:20,260
but nonetheless you don't remember,
you don't have any aversions to reaching,

2110
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:25,690
you're reaching deep today.
Solid grog training day.

2111
02:17:26,650 --> 02:17:30,430
No, those are conceptually, there
were the same thing. They were,

2112
02:17:30,550 --> 02:17:35,260
I know the comparing it's,
you know, most of these world,

2113
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:40,160
most of these like lessons I think, I feel
like they're kind of everywhere. Yeah,

2114
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:41,030
of course.
And you know,

2115
02:17:41,031 --> 02:17:44,650
you're talking about these heavy wars
and heavy like events and then you know,

2116
02:17:44,651 --> 02:17:46,080
in my mind I'm thinking training,

2117
02:17:49,020 --> 02:17:52,420
you know what the, you know, the idea
is still hates the same. There's,

2118
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:57,840
I think there's people out there in
various states of mind share and I think

2119
02:17:58,120 --> 02:17:58,931
that,
you know,

2120
02:17:58,931 --> 02:18:03,910
your perspective helps them maybe
get maybe see some what I'm saying,

2121
02:18:03,930 --> 02:18:05,770
cause maybe I'm,
I'm hitting them from the wrong angle.

2122
02:18:05,771 --> 02:18:09,940
So you're coming in from
trading day movies. Hey Man.

2123
02:18:10,570 --> 02:18:12,700
Yeah. Actually in the end,
come to think about it.

2124
02:18:12,701 --> 02:18:16,530
These concepts right here today when
you're saying, you know, uh, you know,

2125
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:18,820
when it's going well, for
example, when it's going good,

2126
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:22,240
it's easy to turn a blind eye. Isn't
that kind of a lot of movies, how it is,

2127
02:18:22,330 --> 02:18:26,820
it's like the guy does real good
and he's just kinda going in it. He,

2128
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:29,620
he messes up in one way or another.
Like pretty much,

2129
02:18:29,621 --> 02:18:33,790
I think there's this talk by Kurt
Vonnegut and I've seen it on Youtube,

2130
02:18:33,791 --> 02:18:34,820
I think it's Kurt Vonnegut,

2131
02:18:34,821 --> 02:18:37,050
and he's like teaching a class
and you'll grab on to get his,

2132
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:40,720
he's teaching some class, like he
just guest teaching and some classes,

2133
02:18:40,721 --> 02:18:42,520
which is pretty awesome.
But he's talking about like,

2134
02:18:42,521 --> 02:18:46,010
there's four plot lines and they're
all pretty much the same. Yeah,

2135
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:49,110
it's pretty cool. But that's
what happened. You're, you,

2136
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:51,430
you have nothing and then
you get everything. Yeah.

2137
02:18:51,431 --> 02:18:53,810
And then you kind of abuse it kind
of. Then there's, then there's,

2138
02:18:53,890 --> 02:18:55,060
you have nothing.
You get everything,

2139
02:18:55,061 --> 02:18:58,600
you lose everything and then you get
everything back. He's just got these,

2140
02:18:58,690 --> 02:19:03,370
it's like I forget them all, but
it makes sense. They're common. Um,

2141
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:06,070
common storyline.
They must be kind of,

2142
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:09,220
I mean they must be right based
on real life. Like, like term,

2143
02:19:09,250 --> 02:19:11,510
like scenarios that
you go through in life.

2144
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:16,510
I think it's why there's things come back.
Story, Cinderella story, Comeback Kid.

2145
02:19:16,511 --> 02:19:21,480
I mean those things really under
dog story triumphant. Yeah.

2146
02:19:21,550 --> 02:19:24,430
That's how nonetheless of
ear in the mood to support

2147
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:31,440
and you know between your movie
watching escapades that the correct word

2148
02:19:31,941 --> 02:19:35,480
escapades. Yeah. Yeah.
I don't recommend it.

2149
02:19:35,481 --> 02:19:39,470
I recommend you read whatever you'd
train day. Maybe we'll get you there.

2150
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:43,980
That was a good one I thought.
Anyway. Nonetheless, origin means,

2151
02:19:43,981 --> 02:19:47,150
isn't it weird that like training
day is this movie that call,

2152
02:19:47,151 --> 02:19:48,830
how much does it cost to make
training day, I don't know,

2153
02:19:48,831 --> 02:19:51,440
$50 million and like you can go
to the library and get stolen,

2154
02:19:51,441 --> 02:19:55,850
grabbed the book for nothing,
literally nothing. Or you can buy it,

2155
02:19:56,770 --> 02:20:01,770
you can buy it on Amazon for I think
this book cost like a dollar cause it's

2156
02:20:02,541 --> 02:20:07,400
used. But it's just kind of
a strange dichotomy there.

2157
02:20:07,430 --> 02:20:10,970
It's interesting for sure. And uh, you
know, obviously we can go into why,

2158
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:12,140
which one is better for you?

2159
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:15,440
I'm going to go ahead and say that stolen
grads better for you than training day.

2160
02:20:15,550 --> 02:20:17,360
Oh, well, depends on what
you get out of it. You know,

2161
02:20:17,370 --> 02:20:19,820
you know how like asking the
actually people would ask me,

2162
02:20:19,821 --> 02:20:24,410
how do you read to get the most out of it?
How do you well,

2163
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:27,980
I read it while I'm reading it
highlighted. Oh yeah. Jordan B. Peterson.

2164
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:32,000
I was watching something. The other
said, don't highlight anything. Yeah,

2165
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:34,910
this is the f this. I have a major
disagreement with Jordan B. Peterson.

2166
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:39,410
I'm not highlighting,
highlighting fool. But uh,

2167
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:41,120
anyway,
so I go through,

2168
02:20:41,150 --> 02:20:44,900
I highlight what hits me and
then I go back and reread it.

2169
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:48,020
And then I have the red pen
to circle the important,

2170
02:20:48,050 --> 02:20:52,300
really important on the kindle.
It, you can choose your, um,

2171
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:54,280
your color of highlighter.

2172
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:57,440
So the yellow is general
highlighting and then the orange

2173
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:02,480
nonetheless. All right,
well how about this,

2174
02:21:02,481 --> 02:21:07,410
we'll talk about some Jujitsu
gies cause people ask me, yeah,

2175
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:10,640
what, Gee, should I get?
You get origin geese.

2176
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:15,050
That's it made in America from the threats
from the cotton. That's what we say.

2177
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:19,220
As we all know, being an American
to the shirt, dirt to the shirt.

2178
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:21,890
Have you said that field to
finish? No, I just was up there.

2179
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:25,400
I was just up at the factory with Pete.
I caught the Facebook live on it,

2180
02:21:25,401 --> 02:21:28,220
on my head and my mind to this show.
Is that to shame?

2181
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,610
I think it might be just like,
yeah,

2182
02:21:31,650 --> 02:21:35,690
two shirt might be field to
finish hands in daylight,

2183
02:21:35,810 --> 02:21:40,190
hands and daylight, but
yeah, make some good stuff.

2184
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:42,830
Especially geese in America.
Like I said,

2185
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:46,070
I'm good in Jujitsu,

2186
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:49,830
you know I ha I have a few
geese. Ah, a few these,

2187
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:53,390
I don't use any of them except the
origin ones go to or do you mean.com.

2188
02:21:53,391 --> 02:21:56,660
That's where you can get your Ge Ford.
You did too. They also have rash cards,

2189
02:21:56,661 --> 02:21:58,310
compression gear.
Right,

2190
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:01,880
and that's for Jujitsu I think primarily.

2191
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:07,100
But you can use it for other
stuff. Of course. Yeah, indeed.

2192
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:12,020
Big Time.
Also Jocko is some supplements,

2193
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,410
good supplements.
Krill oil.

2194
02:22:15,411 --> 02:22:20,411
I was talking to [inaudible] name is
Josh from Virginia Tech Training Team a

2195
02:22:22,011 --> 02:22:24,320
couple of times there. And I
think he was here for, you know,

2196
02:22:24,330 --> 02:22:27,480
a few weeks ago whenever chain. And uh,
you know, so we talk about somebody,

2197
02:22:27,481 --> 02:22:30,630
he's young, he's 21, and he's like, oh
yeah, I take fish oil. I was like, Dang,

2198
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:34,590
that's good. And krill oil is better
than fish oil. I know this because my,

2199
02:22:35,670 --> 02:22:40,590
I told you, I already, my
dad told me all the benefits,
blah, blah, blah. Nonetheless,

2200
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:44,880
but he's taking joint
supplements at 21. He said, no,

2201
02:22:44,881 --> 02:22:46,170
I don't have problems with my joints,

2202
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:50,790
but I just want to maintain this
joint situation as I get older.

2203
02:22:50,970 --> 02:22:55,170
I was like, Oh, you're way ahead of me.
So, um, so I give them some, uh, your,

2204
02:22:55,990 --> 02:22:59,930
uh, joint warfare. Yeah, that's good. Uh,

2205
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,180
Pete Pete from origin. He, he's,

2206
02:23:03,270 --> 02:23:07,890
he needs joint warfare.
He can feel it dissipate in a day.

2207
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:12,280
And Mike, when I was with was
with him, he'd be, you know,

2208
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:16,350
at five o'clock Nafisa Macra,
hold on, I'll be right back.
Irritation, germ warfare.

2209
02:23:17,270 --> 02:23:21,610
So he said he's at the threshold.
He needs it.

2210
02:23:22,620 --> 02:23:25,200
Yeah. And that's actually, it's
interesting cause you know,

2211
02:23:25,201 --> 02:23:30,201
you can see what's selling and what's
cool is you can see joint warfare,

2212
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:32,940
Krill oil.
Like what's awesome about us,

2213
02:23:32,941 --> 02:23:35,520
it's the repeat customers
of people that order it.

2214
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:37,590
Then they ordered again and
then they ordered again.

2215
02:23:37,950 --> 02:23:40,800
Because you don't want her to, if you're
not feeling it. Yeah, that's what I'm,

2216
02:23:40,830 --> 02:23:42,090
that's how I am with the Krill oil.

2217
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:45,310
100% like if you like I'll
forget and I'll be like,

2218
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:48,480
you know like Oh I'll take it later. I
don't forget. And that, yeah, I know.

2219
02:23:50,010 --> 02:23:53,910
Don't you have a morning routine
and whatever. And that's the thing.

2220
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:56,850
That's the thing doesn't include
just wake up, boom, boom,

2221
02:23:56,851 --> 02:23:59,730
boom from your medicine cabinet open my,
all my stuff is right there.

2222
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:05,700
Not to go too deep, too deep
into my routine. But during
the week it's, you know,

2223
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:09,330
wake up and then there's
like my daughter's four
and a half, she has school.

2224
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:11,790
So there's that situation going on.
This is nice.

2225
02:24:12,070 --> 02:24:17,070
This does not interfere with you getting
up and taking some pills for before you

2226
02:24:17,191 --> 02:24:19,260
brush your teeth.
Kind of not see that's the thing.

2227
02:24:19,261 --> 02:24:23,090
The routine doesn't allow for me to take
them before I've actually, it's part of,

2228
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:26,640
it's the routine is the routine,
the routine. Because for me,

2229
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:30,150
if you gotta you gotta you gotta take
the pills before you brush your teeth.

2230
02:24:30,151 --> 02:24:32,910
Cause when you brush your teeth you got
the strong men in there and it makes the

2231
02:24:32,911 --> 02:24:36,210
water like too cold in your
teeth. Yes. He and I liked that.

2232
02:24:36,211 --> 02:24:40,080
I think it's more refreshing.
I need to harden up a little bit.

2233
02:24:40,110 --> 02:24:44,550
Maybe Jack, probably nonetheless.
Sometimes I forget three,

2234
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:48,300
four and if you forget for like four
days and you're still working out or

2235
02:24:48,301 --> 02:24:52,500
whatever, you'll feel it. I will feel
it. So same thing Crilly I need it.

2236
02:24:53,330 --> 02:24:56,790
Yup. I had Lafe actually, actually Jenna,

2237
02:24:57,090 --> 02:25:01,620
Jenna brought me Krill oil.
I know that Bro. That's okay.

2238
02:25:01,621 --> 02:25:06,460
And I don't want to ask for seventh panic.
My crew oil bring me some,

2239
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:11,280
I don't want to do that, but probably the
most important level seven panic mode.

2240
02:25:11,510 --> 02:25:16,160
Yup. Nonetheless, Krill oil vector, Krill
oil, Krill oil supercrew has a super,

2241
02:25:16,161 --> 02:25:19,860
super krill. It's not normal crowd
super. And there's many reasons for that.

2242
02:25:19,861 --> 02:25:22,530
You can find out on the website or do
you mean.com if you want to know those

2243
02:25:22,531 --> 02:25:26,710
exact reasons. Also joint
warfare, that's for your joints.

2244
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:30,670
Maintain your body structure
while you're working out.

2245
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:35,200
Good call cause it does
dissipate.

2246
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:38,590
I didn't want to use the word dissipate,
but what do you call it? Degenerate.

2247
02:25:38,591 --> 02:25:43,540
Degenerate. Sure. After time when you've,
when you go hard in the paint it does.

2248
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:47,350
Unless like I said, they got compression
gear, gies rash guards, most stuff,

2249
02:25:47,351 --> 02:25:51,100
hoodies, which may or may
not be the most comfortable.

2250
02:25:51,101 --> 02:25:56,080
Hoodies and pants by the way.
The sweatpants. Joggers, joggers,

2251
02:25:56,081 --> 02:25:57,760
yes.
So the the other day I'm like okay,

2252
02:25:57,761 --> 02:26:01,480
I'm exporting some special effect
that I did. So I'm like, shoot,

2253
02:26:01,570 --> 02:26:06,340
when you export it's like
you can't really use that program.

2254
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:09,130
You know you can exit by me. It's
a long story. But so I'm like okay,

2255
02:26:09,131 --> 02:26:11,680
I'm off of my computer for, you know,
it's going to take like 10 minutes.

2256
02:26:11,681 --> 02:26:15,490
A big effect. So like I lay on the
couch and have the whole origin

2257
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:20,860
on for whatever reason just
kind of happened to, I lay
on the couch and I'm like,

2258
02:26:20,861 --> 02:26:24,370
Dang, I don't think I felt this
comfortable in a long time, but it was,

2259
02:26:24,371 --> 02:26:25,620
everything was calm.
That's,

2260
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:29,680
that's pretty bold statement because
you are the experience level of comfort.

2261
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:34,800
I mean comfort seeker hundred percent
and I evaluate you evaluate various

2262
02:26:35,321 --> 02:26:36,470
comfort level level.
It

2263
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:41,890
could have very well been one of the
highest. I get it. It was everything.

2264
02:26:41,891 --> 02:26:43,810
It was a couch.
It was a time of day.

2265
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:48,850
It was the fact that they usually don't
play around with one of my seal buddies

2266
02:26:48,851 --> 02:26:53,380
for many years we were kind of just,
just young,

2267
02:26:53,381 --> 02:26:55,120
dumb frog man.

2268
02:26:55,660 --> 02:27:00,370
We had this yellow couch that
was like 14 feet long. You get,

2269
02:27:00,371 --> 02:27:05,350
it was just kind of deal. It was
like maybe five feet deep. Dang.

2270
02:27:05,950 --> 02:27:09,040
It was like a bed.
Realistically it was like five feet deep.

2271
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:11,860
Which ones you through
the back cushions off.

2272
02:27:11,861 --> 02:27:15,680
It was from my feet deep and
it was probably 1212 feet long.

2273
02:27:15,681 --> 02:27:18,020
And where was this in our
part in your apartment.

2274
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:22,180
Who was gold felt beat.

2275
02:27:22,290 --> 02:27:24,690
We got it from some shop.
Yeah,

2276
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:27,520
that's the kind you have like a
lounge and something dollars for,

2277
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:31,910
we had one like that at Uah in the,
in the football lounge. They was like,

2278
02:27:32,050 --> 02:27:35,380
it wasn't most graspable that couch you
were looking at tonight in my house.

2279
02:27:35,381 --> 02:27:39,070
And you're like, oh that's a nice
couch. That couch out there all nice.

2280
02:27:39,530 --> 02:27:44,520
Doesn't even come close to the comfort
of the old gold couch was the deal. Yeah.

2281
02:27:44,521 --> 02:27:49,521
It's weird how like ugly like couches
will be the most functionally comfortable.

2282
02:27:51,610 --> 02:27:56,050
We had this one my wife forced us to
give away and cause it was outside,

2283
02:27:56,051 --> 02:27:59,320
he got phased out slowly. You know how
you get a new couch and you're like, okay,

2284
02:27:59,321 --> 02:28:02,020
where do we do that where I'm not
going to give it away because it's too

2285
02:28:02,021 --> 02:28:05,140
comfortable and we've had it for so
long and it's like in good shape. Oh.

2286
02:28:05,141 --> 02:28:07,320
And then we get another couch for
the, for the side. They're all,

2287
02:28:07,321 --> 02:28:09,790
we know we do with this so and
so. It ends up outside, you know,

2288
02:28:09,791 --> 02:28:12,910
and he wants to get of a cow, not a couch
outside. It's like it's of, you know,

2289
02:28:13,110 --> 02:28:16,720
it doesn't, does, doesn't look good,
blah, blah, blah. Give it away.

2290
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:18,090
But it was the most comfortable culture.

2291
02:28:18,091 --> 02:28:19,810
I think we actually know the
new ones more comfortable.

2292
02:28:19,811 --> 02:28:23,440
I don't know what I'm talking
about. Nonetheless. Back origin,

2293
02:28:23,610 --> 02:28:26,270
go to origin main.com.
That's it.

2294
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:30,950
That's where you get it and
you can get the discipline
there too. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2295
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:34,580
The discipline, big time. The preworkout,

2296
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:39,140
the pre mission remission. That
remission. Yeah. She didn't say it to me.

2297
02:28:39,141 --> 02:28:43,130
I take it before a workout. See, I
don't, I take it before I do Jitsu.

2298
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:48,430
I take it before I have to do a podcast
or I take it before I have to do like

2299
02:28:48,930 --> 02:28:53,490
an, like a speaking event, go where I need
to my brain. It has to be firing. Yeah.

2300
02:28:53,510 --> 02:28:55,820
Yeah. Could you just
keep before bid? I mean,

2301
02:28:55,821 --> 02:29:00,821
I know it has a little bit of caffeine
but like I have and I think you can't,

2302
02:29:02,481 --> 02:29:04,010
I don't think I'd strongly recommend it.

2303
02:29:04,190 --> 02:29:07,190
Especially if you're caffeine sensitive
like I am, I'm caffeine sensitive.

2304
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:10,010
But you drink your nine
monster energy drinks a day.

2305
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:14,420
You can drink whatever you want from
you talk a white tea cause there's a lot

2306
02:29:14,421 --> 02:29:17,870
less caffeine. The you figure the
discipline. She saw a lot of people,

2307
02:29:17,871 --> 02:29:21,500
you know a lot of people hit me of used
Jocko white tea to ween off of full

2308
02:29:21,501 --> 02:29:26,240
strength coffee cause they don't want
to be on that coffee but there's enough

2309
02:29:26,241 --> 02:29:29,000
need caffeine.
They lit a little something to wean off.

2310
02:29:29,001 --> 02:29:33,500
It's like Methadone getting off heroin.
So you might want to try that.

2311
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:34,311
You don't the Jocko white tea,

2312
02:29:34,311 --> 02:29:38,060
you want to have coffee breath anymore
because no one likes that. Yeah,

2313
02:29:38,061 --> 02:29:42,350
it's brilliant. It's really not
like Methadone. But since the uh,

2314
02:29:42,351 --> 02:29:47,030
the pre workout,
pre mission has a cognitive enhancers,

2315
02:29:47,031 --> 02:29:48,140
you figure, you know, when you sleep,

2316
02:29:48,141 --> 02:29:50,190
that's like the best part
of your brain or cupboard.

2317
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:51,620
Best time for your brain to recover.

2318
02:29:51,621 --> 02:29:54,710
Maybe that's a little something I
don't recommend it cause like I said,

2319
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:57,200
but you never know. Could
be, could be something.

2320
02:29:57,440 --> 02:30:01,520
I wouldn't drink it before I go to
bed. Maybe when you wake up. Yeah.

2321
02:30:01,550 --> 02:30:04,250
But I don't drink when I wake up I'll
drink cause I don't drink it for,

2322
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:07,580
I don't drink any kind of pre
workout for it before I work out,

2323
02:30:07,581 --> 02:30:12,350
before I lift weights, before I do a
metcon I don't, yeah, maybe I should,

2324
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:12,950
I don't know.

2325
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:16,280
Maybe I should try and one of the reasons
cause I don't like have anything in my

2326
02:30:16,281 --> 02:30:19,800
stomach when I'm working out. Yeah. But
those pre workouts is like, yeah, I know.

2327
02:30:19,801 --> 02:30:22,820
It's not really anything, right. It's
just like water. Like water. Yeah.

2328
02:30:23,210 --> 02:30:27,860
I'll maybe I'll try it. Yeah,
tell me. Report back please.
Okay. We'll do. Yes sir.

2329
02:30:28,150 --> 02:30:30,320
Also speaking of working out,

2330
02:30:31,660 --> 02:30:35,480
I get my kettle kettle bells from on
it on.com/chocolates we can get them

2331
02:30:35,610 --> 02:30:39,440
kettlebells, the designer whey you
don't have to get the designer ones.

2332
02:30:39,441 --> 02:30:42,830
I know all we say the designer ones get
to designer ones and I'm still saying it

2333
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:46,410
big time. Let's see. You don't have to
like, let me get to know him a little.

2334
02:30:46,430 --> 02:30:50,210
Get to know ones, but nonetheless on
it, they have other cool workout stuff.

2335
02:30:50,211 --> 02:30:51,590
You want your work out to be creative

2336
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:58,970
telling me like, you know the, you know
the mace rate one of those? I have. I do.

2337
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,900
Yeah. You ever done like a workout with
a mace? Yeah. Yeah. I incorporate them.

2338
02:31:02,930 --> 02:31:07,070
My name for, I've got to mace exercises,
but one of them is called like,

2339
02:31:07,250 --> 02:31:08,930
can I have notes in my notebook on what?

2340
02:31:08,931 --> 02:31:13,340
My workout and I have like
barbarian smash. That's the word.

2341
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:16,040
No, no, no. That's the
movement of the movement. Okay.

2342
02:31:16,041 --> 02:31:20,610
I think made up and then one's like a
battle ax swing. Sure. So, yeah. Yeah.

2343
02:31:20,611 --> 02:31:24,210
It's like you can do those with the
mace. Yeah. And it amazes heavy though.

2344
02:31:24,770 --> 02:31:28,040
Like my race is 20 pounds.
Yeah. That's heavy for

2345
02:31:29,730 --> 02:31:34,260
Tevye. 20 pounds. That's how much
the baseball bat way. Oh, I dunno.

2346
02:31:34,890 --> 02:31:37,380
I Dunno. A couple pounds.
You can put your sauce,

2347
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:39,990
16 ounce weight the other
day for the end of your bat.

2348
02:31:39,991 --> 02:31:43,920
When you're getting warmed
up. A Macy's 20 pounds. Yes.

2349
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:48,420
It's really heavy and the, to me, you
gotta be careful actually. Yeah, big time.

2350
02:31:48,460 --> 02:31:49,290
Yeah,
because be careful.

2351
02:31:49,290 --> 02:31:53,040
You don't expect that much weight on
a mount of Mace with that weird cause.

2352
02:31:53,041 --> 02:31:54,660
The 20 pound Dumbbell, you think, oh,

2353
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:56,430
that's a 20 but that's not
even part of the workout.

2354
02:31:56,480 --> 02:31:59,420
I don't need to warm up with
20 pounds in any exercise.

2355
02:31:59,421 --> 02:32:02,280
The kind of attitude and then you're
like swooped winter blues so late.

2356
02:32:02,281 --> 02:32:03,440
Then you pick up that
mace and you're like,

2357
02:32:03,441 --> 02:32:07,830
this is like the heaviest stick I've
ever be held for sure in stick form.

2358
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:11,880
Nonetheless, the three, give them a lot
of this stuff too. It's really cool.

2359
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:15,720
So go on a dotcom slash Jocko

Yeah, Spotify to confirmed. Boom. Do it.

2363
02:32:30,750 --> 02:32:35,010
Also Youtube, if you want the
video version of this podcast,

2364
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:39,090
she wouldn't see what Jocko looks like.
You know, you're into that kind of stuff.

2365
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:41,190
Look on Youtube.
Also have excerpts on there.

2366
02:32:41,370 --> 02:32:44,890
Actually someone emailed me and
said just for the excerpts at, Hey,

2367
02:32:44,891 --> 02:32:47,070
thanks for putting excerpts on there.
That's pretty cool.

2368
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:49,830
That is pretty cool to be like,
yeah, just hey, this is cool.

2369
02:32:50,010 --> 02:32:52,620
So obviously it's a good thing.
There are excerpts on there.

2370
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:56,100
That's a good thing cause sometimes
the podcast goes a little long,

2371
02:32:57,050 --> 02:33:00,690
especially this section.
No,

2372
02:33:00,691 --> 02:33:05,150
I think your two hours of reading
the book,

2373
02:33:05,730 --> 02:33:10,190
not in the less youtube, some value
there. I think if you, you know,

2374
02:33:10,191 --> 02:33:14,010
you watch with so certain people they put
it in there each year. Live some point.

2375
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:15,870
Yeah.
On our,

2376
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:20,550
on the youtube channel we'll pull
even more value. Send you an alert,

2377
02:33:20,820 --> 02:33:23,700
right? I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
If you're subscribed, yeah.

2378
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:27,510
If you allow the alert and you're
subscribing you can. Yeah. That's good.

2379
02:33:27,910 --> 02:33:31,440
You do good way to support.
Also Jocko is a store.

2380
02:33:31,530 --> 02:33:36,530
It's called Jocko store Jocko store.com
that's where you can get all the cool

2381
02:33:38,431 --> 02:33:42,720

I'm going to put something new.
Every single,

2388
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:10,150
I don't know what you're not.

2389
02:34:12,210 --> 02:34:13,680
I'm like closet committed.
I don't know.

2390
02:34:13,681 --> 02:34:16,980
Every month I'll put something new and
people have a dial you to tell you what

2391
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:20,980
they want. No, actually,
yes, actually I like that.

2392
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:23,440
Or even she'll be on
social media. Email. Yeah.

2393
02:34:23,470 --> 02:34:26,010
Email through the store or
Twitter or whatever the PR we do.

2394
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:28,450
Everyone does for sure.
They see all this stuff.

2395
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:32,530
Is suggestions actually alive
there. Yeah, exactly right.

2396
02:34:32,531 --> 02:34:37,340
Heavier duty sweatshirts, hats,
beanies beneath, you know,

2397
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:40,240
they're on the way. Yeah. So yeah,
they're in the pipe for sure.

2398
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:42,880
100% that's a suggestion.
Yeah.

2399
02:34:43,330 --> 02:34:47,560
This is all people
suggestions from the field.

2400
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:51,790
Say that. Yeah. So yeah, it takes
suggestions. Big Time. I kind of,

2401
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,090
I pulled the trigger on the ones
that have the most suggestions.

2402
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:57,970
So sometimes I understand that,
you know, if you're like, Hey,

2403
02:34:57,971 --> 02:35:01,180
I made a suggestion and I still
haven't seen the, you know,

2404
02:35:01,630 --> 02:35:04,960
you're in the field too and I dig it,
but if you're the only one siren, sorry,

2405
02:35:06,450 --> 02:35:09,790
I got no pull over here. Yeah, you
get a little, not that much though,

2406
02:35:10,150 --> 02:35:13,330
unless anyway, Jaclyn [inaudible]
dot com that's the place. Also,

2407
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:17,320
psychological warfare. If you didn't
know what that is, here's what it is.

2408
02:35:17,321 --> 02:35:21,280
It's an album that you can buy an iTunes,
Amazon music,

2409
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,030
Google play, anywhere where
you can buy MP three downloads.

2410
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:29,860
It's an album that you can buy
with tracks, chocolate tracks,

2411
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:32,130
and this is what it's for.
It's not music.

2412
02:35:32,131 --> 02:35:35,800
It's not Jocko singing or playing guitar.
What else do you play?

2413
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:40,910
Ukulele now? Yeah. You can lay it
up. Yeah, that you can't. So Jackson,

2414
02:35:40,911 --> 02:35:43,750
I'm playing that and he's, he's
speaking to you. Pragmatic.

2415
02:35:43,751 --> 02:35:48,751
He's given us us pragmatic advice on
why or how I would say how to overcome

2416
02:35:51,491 --> 02:35:56,350
certain points of weakness in
our campaigns against weakness.

2417
02:35:56,410 --> 02:35:58,960
That's what it is.
So you know you want to skip the workout,

2418
02:35:58,990 --> 02:36:00,820
you want to cheat on the diet or it isn't.

2419
02:36:00,820 --> 02:36:03,940
You're compelled to one day cause you're,
you're feeling tired.

2420
02:36:04,930 --> 02:36:09,310
If you run into little speed bumps
and your campaign, listen to this,

2421
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:11,890
to the track where everything,
trust me, just look at it.

2422
02:36:12,400 --> 02:36:16,900
What if instead of somebody
wanting to watch training day,

2423
02:36:17,020 --> 02:36:19,560
they want to read one of these books,
where could they get them in?

2424
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:23,860
What's the best way to shop for them while
supporting this podcast? Glad you ask.

2425
02:36:23,890 --> 02:36:27,880
I got the solution right now. This is
what I did. If you didn't know already,

2426
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:32,200
here's what I did. Go to
Jocko, podcast.com Jocko
podcast.com not the store.

2427
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:33,460
It's the podcast website.

2428
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:38,760
Oregonized all the books by episode in
a section called books from the podcast.

2429
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:42,640
Click through there. Actually that's a
good way to support two takes it Amazon,

2430
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:45,160
Amazon prime to get the
book in like two days. Boom.

2431
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:46,960
And it supports the podcast to big time.

2432
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:52,390
Good way to support things
whenever you like. Man. Long
Mow, lawn mowers, duct tape.

2433
02:36:52,810 --> 02:36:55,210
What else? Rubber.
Duckies if you have kids,

2434
02:36:55,270 --> 02:37:00,010
you know what else you can get on
amazon.com as you can get Jocko white tea.

2435

2436
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:08,190
Also order yourself some new weight
because upon drinking Jocko white tea,

2437
02:37:08,681 --> 02:37:13,681
you will be able to dead lift
8,000 pounds certified you.

2438
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:16,100

did. All right. We'll leave
it at that. It's all good.

2440

It's all good.
It happens.

2441
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:29,810

books, some books, uh,

2442
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:33,110

2443
02:37:33,490 --> 02:37:35,360
The one of them is called
way of the warrior kid.

2444
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:41,080
That book teaches kids to do
the right things in their lives.

2445
02:37:41,130 --> 02:37:45,830
Study, read, workout, eat clean,
help others work hard, uh,

2446
02:37:45,950 --> 02:37:50,270
get tons of feedback on that
book because it helps kids.

2447
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:54,380
They relate to it.
Speaking of related to it,

2448
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:58,940
there's a little warrior get out there.
12 years old and name is Aiden.

2449
02:38:01,010 --> 02:38:04,070
He reached out to me and wanted,

2450
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:07,880
he makes soap from goat milk.
Do you hear this story?

2451
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:11,300
Makes me hear the whole story.
Okay. He makes so from goat milk.

2452
02:38:11,301 --> 02:38:12,800
You know why he makes soap from goat milk.

2453
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:16,010
You can't do anything with
goat milk in California.

2454
02:38:16,011 --> 02:38:19,460
You can't sell it to someone
because it's not edible or whatever.

2455
02:38:19,461 --> 02:38:22,070
They have laws reglaze
write the regs in place.

2456
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:24,950
What do you do with goat milk then?
He didn't know what to do with it.

2457
02:38:25,010 --> 02:38:29,930
Did he figure it out? I'll make soap
and then he wanted to make good soap

2458
02:38:31,730 --> 02:38:35,180
and so he said, hey, can I make some
Jocko soap? And I was like, Yeah Dude,

2459
02:38:35,181 --> 02:38:36,830
you're 12 years old.
Get after it.

2460
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:42,100
And he did Irish oaks
ranch.com you can order yours.

2461
02:38:43,550 --> 02:38:44,930
Oh,
it was on a link on the website.

2462
02:38:45,110 --> 02:38:49,700
Front page so you can support a young or
your kid. 12 years old business owner.

2463
02:38:50,930 --> 02:38:55,010
So legit way I hit him.
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

2464
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:58,790
That's also about getting stronger,
smarter, faster, healthier and better.

2465
02:39:00,190 --> 02:39:04,850
The audio version of that is not on
audible. It's on iTunes, Amazon music,

2466
02:39:04,851 --> 02:39:08,980
Google play. It's an album
with tracks by the way. Sure.

2467
02:39:08,990 --> 02:39:12,800
Actually it's two albums with tracks.
On top of that,

2468
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:14,180
we've got extreme ownership.

2469
02:39:14,300 --> 02:39:17,840
The book written by myself
and my brother Leif Babin.

2470
02:39:19,010 --> 02:39:22,040
It's about combat leadership.
That's what it's about.

2471
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:27,200
And if you want to learn how to lead,
you can check out that book.

2472
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:32,150
Also, if your business team or your
organization needs a little extra help,

2473
02:39:32,151 --> 02:39:36,590
you can utilize our leadership
consulting company called Echelon Front.

2474
02:39:37,130 --> 02:39:39,620
You're, you're in a lot of talk
tonight about the rear echelon.

2475
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:43,880
That's why we named national
and international on front
the rear echelon of the

2476
02:39:43,881 --> 02:39:46,210
people in the rear echelon.

2477
02:39:46,250 --> 02:39:49,520
The front echelon is the people in the
front lines and that's why we named the

2478
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:52,790
organization Ashkelon Front because
there's a lot of people that talk about

2479
02:39:52,791 --> 02:39:55,790
leadership, but they're talking about
it from the rear echelon, from the back.

2480
02:39:56,480 --> 02:39:58,010
We're talking about it from the front,

2481
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:01,970
our experiences on the front lines.

2482
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:06,770
We solve problems,
whatever problems through leadership.

2483
02:40:06,980 --> 02:40:11,320
So that's our company national in
front. Me, Leif, Babin, JP Denelle,
