1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,583
Jocko.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:07,210
My boss is incredibly controlling.
An Ego maniacal.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,850
I like him already.
Ego Maniac.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,103
I have,

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,730
I have attempted to use extreme ownership
in dealing with the people under me,

6
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:22,990
but my boss has reprimanded me
for leading. He has said he gets,

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,200
he gets to do all the leading because
he's the one in charge, quote unquote and,

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,960
and his job title is higher than mine.
I've had that happen to me before.

9
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:34,810
By the way,
if I could continue to try to lead,

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,060
my responsibilities will be taken away.
If I stepped back into the shadows,

11
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,670
I won't make an impact on the
people under me. What should I do?

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,770
So it's black and white.
Yeah,

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,070
in his mind seems that either step up
and lead and get fired or step in the

14
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:57,170
shadows and do nothing and everyone will
suffer. It's not, it's not that way,

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,640
right? It's not. It's not black and white.

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,960
And actually start by putting your own
ego in check because you're calling

17
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:07,370
someone at ego maniacal, but
you're, your ego is being,

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,650
being touched a little bit here,

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,220
rubbed the wrong way a little
bit because you want to lead.

20
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,470
And when you get told don't lead,
you got paid to and offends you.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,320
Guess what that is? You're
here. That's your ego.

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,620
So what you need to do is maybe you like
that you liked the feeling of being in

23
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:29,000
charge. That's cool. I liked
the feeling of being charge.
Yeah, it feels good to me.

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,580
It feels normal to me when I'm
not in charge. I don't like it.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,970
I have to consciously suppress it,
which is fine.

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,350
Sometimes you don't have to do that.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,550
Like right in the situation here that
this guy's talking about and what you need

28
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:45,551
to suppress is you need to not
be so overt with your leadership.

29
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,700
He shouldn't even be able to
sense that you're leading,

30
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:53,900
but you should be leading.
You gotta be under the radar.

31
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:56,300
You gotta be covert with what
you're doing. And by the way,

32
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,580
while you're doing that,
you're massaging homeboys. Ego,

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,720
make him feel good about it. Making
them feel mad. He is running things.

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,941
And because,

35
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:09,941
because you can absolutely lead from
the shadows if your ego allows it.

36
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,780
Because a lot of times when we want,
when we lead,

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,190
we want everyone to know
that would lead him.

38
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,080
I want everyone to know that
I'm in charge. I don't want
them to know that. Right.

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,310
That's really hard when you're leaving
from the shadows. A lot of times,

40
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:30,311
not even the people that you're leading
recognize overtly that you're leading.

41
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,743
Think about that.

42
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,410
So the people that are actually following
you don't even know that they're

43
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:39,380
following you. They don't.
They don't consciously know it.

44
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,710
Maybe if they were to break down
and you give, gave him like a, Hey,

45
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,730
who do you think is actually
giving you instruct legal? Well,

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,020
I think that might be probably, that
seems like it's echo. Okay. Okay.

47
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:52,610
But they don't like consciously think
about it. So that's what you need to do.

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,970
You need to suppress
your overt leadership.

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,090
Not Step on the boss's toes.
Massages,

50
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,190
massage his ego a little bit
because if you do get your response,

51
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,320
do you want to help? Right?
Well, you want to be helpful.

52
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,170
You want to lead these people
in a great way. If you don't,

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,540
if you get your responsibilities
taken away or you get fired,

54
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,750
then you can't help anyone, anybody.
You're not gonna help the team at all.

55
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,050
So you have to be smart and you have to
play the game to win his confidence and

56
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:22,090
his trust.
So he does let you lead.

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,630
And what's going to do that
when he realizes that you're
gonna not gonna step on

58
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:28,510
his toes, that you're going to give him
the credit because he wants a credit.

59
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,580
He's an EGOMANIAC,
right? He's controlling.

60
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,550
So that's kind of what you need to do.

61
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,130
Now, this is the weird thing
and this came up at the muster.

62
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,760
People don't want to hear me say that.

63
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,590
People don't want to hear me say that.
People don't want to hear me say that.

64
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:52,300
If I come up against a boss, the big
ego, what you need to do is back down.

65
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,200
People don't want to hear me say that.
They say they want to hear me.

66
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,080
Say if you come up against
someone with a big ego,

67
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,000
what you do is you blow up to them and
you show them that they ain't got nothing

68
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,500
on you. Yeah, don't back down.

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,750
Don't back down to that guy with a
big ego that's weak. It's true. And,

70
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,000
and what I said at the muster and I said,
I said, listen, cause I could see it,

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,140
I could see it. People are like, ah yeah,

72
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,120
I guess Jocko isn't always as hardcore
as I thought he was because he's going to

73
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,780
back down to somebody with a big
ego and I said, guess what people,

74
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,300
this is why you feel that way.
If there was a,

75
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,350
a machine gun nest on a hill and there
was a bad guy in there and he's killing a

76
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,850
bunch of people shooting that machine gun
and everyone in the room wants to look

77
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,740
at Jocko and say,

78
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:42,850
Jockos brave and Jock who's tough and
Jack was going to charge that machine gun

79
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,470
nest and take that guy out.
Well guess what?

80
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,790
A machine gun belt fed weapon in
an elevated position bunkered in.

81
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm not going to take that guy out.
I can't.

82
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,060
It's a heavily defended position.
I can't do that.

83
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,140
So what Jocko does is backs down.

84
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,550
I hide,
I get behind cover so I don't die

85
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,130
once I've gotten behind cover so I don't
die. I look at Echo when I say echo,

86
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,330
stay here. Shoot some rounds at
this guy. Occasionally distract him.

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm going to flank him. So that
goes gonna keep undercover himself.

88
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:27,760
He's going to playing some rounds
up with a machine gun nest.

89
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,880
While he's doing that, I'm going
to scurry away like a little baby,

90
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,350
like little sneaky little squirrel.

91
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,940
And I'm going to go around to the flank
cause the machine gun is in a bunker,

92
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,560
right? So he can't see out the
sides. I'm coming up the side,

93
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,060
I'm going to get right to the assignment
to toss a grenade in there and kill him.

94
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,410
I'm going to take out the ego, but
I didn't do it. Go in head on. Yeah.

95
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,010
So what happens is people come and go
up against this big ego and they want to

96
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:59,420
be the hero and they want be aggressive
and they want to the default aggressive

97
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:03,260
Jocko. You say you got a chapter in
your book, default aggressive man.

98
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm going to be default aggressive
against that ego. Wrong answer. Yeah,

99
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,600
the right answers. Indirect warfare,
the right answers, maneuver warfare,

100
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:15,380
the right answers. You flank
these people, and by the way,

101
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,280
if I do charge that machine gun nest or
I do attack that guy's ego, guess what?

102
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,680
I die or I get fired and
now I'm no good to anybody.

103
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,750
So it's people have this,

104
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,850
this desire to be the strong
hero and you have to fight that.

105
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,460
That's your ego. That's my ego
charging the machine gun nest.

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,780
I'm going to go do this on the man. No,
I'm actually not the man. It's a machine.

107
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:43,480
Go Nova position. I'm going to
die. You have to be smart. Yeah.

108
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,830
Like Glenn attack that you go head on.

109
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,800
Don't attack heavily defended
positions head on period.

110
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,630
Like you sit in training day.
You ever watch that movie
training day? No. Come on,

111
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:58,160
Ray, you've watched it anyway. He
says, the Shit is chess, not checkers.

112
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,050
He's not the first person that ever said,
but it was dope when he said it.

113
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,370
In my opinion. Nonetheless, yes.

114
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:10,270
So default aggressive isn't default
aggressive. Hey, it to hit its default.

115
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,510
Default aggressive in being
effective. Yes. Yes. That is really,

116
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:18,430
you're effective or ineffective, and I
see their muster, you know, I listen.

117
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,810
Lafe knows what he's
talking about it like that.
