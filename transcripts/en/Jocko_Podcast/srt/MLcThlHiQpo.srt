1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,570
Jocko,
I coach high school football,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,200
which should I do with the star athlete
who's segregates himself and won't

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:12,140
participate in hard drills or it won't
participate hard in drills. Yeah.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,111
Now this one,

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,580
I actually thankfully remembered that I
said I would do this because when I got

6
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:17,791
this,

7
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:22,791
this is a Twitter question and I responded
to this Twitter question in one word.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,510
So you know, he says, I got this guy, Star
athlete, he won't participate in drills.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,050
What should I do with him? I responded
in one word bench thought that.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,350
So, so of course, you know,
then people start saying, well,

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,550
you know, and I was like,
yeah, I know we're on Twitter,
right? We're on Twitter. Uh,

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,040
there's more to it then what's happening?

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,070
I just answered 798 questions and this
was 799 so I'm not going to go into full

14
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:53,610
detail. But then as people were kind
of chime in and I was like, okay, I'll,

15
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:58,611
I'll answer this on the podcast so
we can go into it a little bit more.

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,560
Because yes, your coach, your leader,

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,040
and obviously I talk
about this all the time,

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,690
leadership is a nuanced thing.
It takes balance,

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,760
it takes maneuvering, it takes
chess playing, it takes mental,

20
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,200
Jujitsu, it takes all those things, right?

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,550
So the obvious answer of just like bench,
that's my meat head answer.

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,050
And fundamentally we'll get to it,
but,

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,790
and fundamentally that may be the result,
but let's dive into it a little bit.

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,590
Who's The kid? What's his deal? What's
his background? What's his attitude?

25
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,830
Where's he coming from?
What's his family like life?

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,880
Or what's his family life like?
What is,

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,620
what's his past performance? What's
his record? What year is he in school?

28
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:48,630
I mean there's all kinds of
things we need to know, right?

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,370
So now once we've sort of figured out
what he liked now that any one of those

30
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:56,040
things,
any one of those variables is going to,

31
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,290
is going to change our course
of action a little bit.

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,430
Because being the leader doesn't mean
you get to follow a cookie cutter results

33
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,830
or cookie cutter solutions to things,
right?

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,620
You're dealing with human beings and
every single human being is different,

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,180
and every single human being has a
little craziness to him that you cannot

36
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,870
predict. So we're dealing with a
kid. Guess what? A 16 year old boy,

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,090
that kid is even more unpredictable and
even more crazy than most because he's

38
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,210
got testosterone flowing through his
system. He's chasing girls, he's,

39
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,970
he's just going crazy.
He's not secure with himself yet.

40
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:30,060
He's got zits on his face. He's,
you know, he's got things going on,

41
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,080
he's got issues. And so this kid is crazy
and we're trying to deal with it now.

42
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,240
Most kids can get,
you know,

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,080
they get through that and they're
still participating with the team.

44
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:40,620
This gets not, so one of the
first things I always say this,

45
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,050
you got somebody that's not stepping up
into leadership position or they're not

46
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,040
wandering. You put them in charge
of it. You know, you say, Hey, echo,

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,200
I want you to run this drill.

48
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,070
I think the way I'm watching
you perform on the field,

49
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,040
but I think you could really
lead this drill. Well,

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,390
I want you to lead this drill and show
these guys what's up, right? Oh, so,

51
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:58,221
so you know what I mean?

52
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,490
Like he's got a little fired up
face on your look just there.

53
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,720
So that might take his attitude. And
now instead of me saying, Hey Echo,

54
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,820
you've got to do this
drill like everyone else.

55
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,510
I already know that you don't want to do
that. So I'm elevating you a little bit,

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,850
given your ego, a little
push, a little massage,

57
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,850
and maybe you feel good about that
now. And I say, Hey, you know,

58
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,220
you can run this drill faster than
anyone else. I want you to lead it.

59
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,640
I want you to show them how to do it. I
want you to make our team better. Boom.

60
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,560
All of a sudden you're getting
a little fired up. So that's,

61
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,940
that's one solution type,
right?

62
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,090
I'm just getting kind of a broad solution
types on. Another solution type is is,

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,940
and this is real easy,
real easy,

64
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,080
is when you're talking to someone that
you want to improve their performance,

65
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,110
you don't go to them and say, Hey, uh,

66
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,090
you need to get better because you're
just right now you're letting the whole

67
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:49,300
team down and you're just,
you think you're all good.

68
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,100
You think you're so good
that you don't need to coach.

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,460
You don't need to run drills with the
team. You need to run drills to the team.

70
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,400
Now your attitude is what
are you talking about?

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,520
So instead of saying that I again,

72
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,100
I'm going to eagle you up a
little bit and be say, Hey man,

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,451
I'm going to talk to you.

74
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:10,040
I've got to talk to you because I see so
much potential with you with your game.

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,230
I see your athletic ability and I see
the way that the other guys on the team

76
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:19,220
look at you. You might not sense it.
They look up to you. You're a leader,

77
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:20,510
whether you want to be a leader or not,

78
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,960
and the potential that you have and is
as an athlete is not going to come to

79
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:31,301
fruition unless you at least get some
of your potential as a leader in line.

80
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,740
So the reason I want you to run these
drills isn't to make you better.

81
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:39,980
I already know you're good.
I already know you're good at the drills.

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,190
The reason I want you to run these
drills, Chi, wants you to be even better.

83
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,240
I want you to reach your potential.

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,970
And by the way you help and run these
drills is going to make the team better.

85
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,310
And the better the team does,
the better you're going to do.

86
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,200
The more scouts we're going
to here looking at you.

87
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,610
So there's that,

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,990
and obviously I'm gonna explain to him
why the drills are important for him and

89
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,590
for the team and for am and the team
together for the all everyone to reach

90
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,610
their potential. So those
were, those are good too.

91
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,150
I guess overall,

92
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:12,970
broadly what I'd be doing this
whole time is talking to the person,

93
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,640
talking to the individual,
trying to figure out

94
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,070
what his reasons were for not wanting
to participate in the drills and then

95
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:26,071
countering those reasons with
logical answers and you know,

96
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:28,691
saying,
Hey,

97
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:32,140
here's why it's important and explaining
it to them and then eventually you're

98
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:35,860
going to get to a point where my
coaching, my explaining, my maneuvering,

99
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,240
my mental Jujitsu,

100
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,780
none of it's worked and he's still
telling me I'm not running the drills.

101
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:45,430
I don't need to. Cool.
Bench next question.

102
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:48,350
You know what I mean? Well, you
played ball. What do you think? Yeah,

103
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,580
because I didn't play football. Yeah,
no, that's exactly right. I would,

104
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,540
I would think,

105
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,240
and I'm trying to put myself
in the mindset back when
I was in high school. Oh,

106
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,183
I remember

107
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,300
going into my senior year. So you have
a, we had some kind of summer training,

108
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,840
so it was really like high school summer
training. Edis no, no, no. That was,

109
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:10,040
that was for fall. Okay. Um, and
that was like a camp situation,

110
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,120
but no summer training,

111
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,120
which was like after spring and
stuff in it and what they'd call it,

112
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:18,020
they call it technique sessions.
And all it was was like, you know,

113
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:21,440
I played in high school was
kind of like a slap back,

114
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:25,510
which is a hybrid running back
wide receiver type. And um,

115
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,270
so the technique sessions were just
kind of passing drills and you know,

116
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,740
just hand stuff and maybe even some
foot work. But it was kind of fun.

117
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,371
It was just,
you know,

118
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,880
the quarterback who was there and the
receivers in the writing back then you

119
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,250
catch passes, run routes and stuff and you
know, for like, I don't know, 45 minutes,

120
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:40,550
hour.
