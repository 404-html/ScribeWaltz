1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,190
This is Jocko podcast number
one 47 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,070
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,680
It's been a little while since we've done
some Q and a so we'll do some Q and. A.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,160
Cool.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,570
Thanks to everyone for the questions
that you have submitted to the podcast,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,120
just a reminder of what's the
best way to submit a question.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,180
The best way is Twitter
or Facebook and yeah,

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,590
those are the best of your Facebook.
My Facebook or my Twitter.

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,910
I don't, the Instagram messages
are just out of control.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,690
There's too many of them and I appreciate
it, but I can't get a grip on them.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,520
So Twitter and and people would,
if it's a long question,

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,550
well the right three Twitter statements.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,860
If it's longer than you
know that many characters,

14
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:54,540
it's probably then go to Facebook. If
this is like really a long, long thing,

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,830
then just go to Facebook and send
me the message. What is that called?

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,400
A Facebook message? Instant
Messenger. Direct message.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,760
I think DM is like a con when Your
Messenger on Facebook is what I get.

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,910
I deal again, I apologize. I don't
get to respond to all of them.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,330
Sometimes I just try and get somebody
a little like the, hey, I read it. Hey,

20
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:19,860
thanks. Uh, you know, you
know what to do. Right.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,290
A lot of times people, they're just asking
me because they want to get confirmed.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,940
Yeah, yeah. Hey, do you think I've,

23
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm having problems with this
girl when she cheated on me,

24
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,580
but I don't know if I should leave or
not. It's like, you know what to do bro.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,620
You know what to do. So
speaking, of course, thanks
for everyone for the questions.

26
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,720
And,
and that being said,

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,940
I still look at just about
everything that comes in. Sometimes.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,780
Sometimes they get a little bit lost,
but I look at everything that comes in.

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,290
Sometimes people, if you're
listening, if you send me a question,

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,140
some people would ask
me a question that I've,

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,400
I've literally been asked
and we've answered on the
podcast three or four times.

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,870
So keep listening to the podcast
because if I don't say anything,

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,380
most likely it's because
I've answered that over.

34
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:08,580
I've answered it two or three times
or you can deduce what to do just from

35
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:12,010
listening to the podcast. You'll figure it
out. Oh, I need to go get after it. Like

36
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,520
you know,
went into Elko.

37
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,640
I think that it might be a
good idea to have let go. What?

38
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,730
Equity Cough frequently
ass. Yeah, I know. I know.

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,240
We do need to do that.
Yeah. So let's do it.

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,700
Check first question.
We said that for like two years.

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,530
Yeah, I did. Right when I said that
I was like, should I think? Yeah,

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,410
that'd be no 10 Debbie put together
like a whole thing on that maybe.

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,090
Yeah she did. So we could probably dig
that up and actually put it to use,

44
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,170
which would be smart. Yes sir. I
believe. I believe the same thing.

45
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,563
First question,

46
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,810
do you have any thoughts on what dis
disciplines someone can use to improve

47
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:58,980
their decision making skills as a leader?

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,470
Not only in keeping clarity of thought
during high pressured situations and

49
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:06,940
environments, but also in making the
correct decisions when it is vital. Okay,

50
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,180
so we've talked about this last week.
You have to learn to detach.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,780
And how do you learn to detach?
You've learned it.

52
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:16,090
Hatch by putting yourself in stressful
situations and then observing how you

53
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:20,140
react. So good stretch, stressful
situations to put yourself in. Well,

54
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,450
what makes you stressed? One thing
that will make everyone's stressed,

55
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:26,140
especially when they first start,
is start with Jujitsu. That's gonna,

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,380
that's gonna put you in stressful
environments. Look at sports.

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,800
What are you going to do? You know, put
yourself in stressful positions in sports.

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,490
What else makes you stress?
Public speaking, right?

59
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,610
Public speaking makes some people really
stressed out and start doing it more.

60
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,060
What about competition
shooting where you've got a,

61
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,490
or hunting where you've got
to do something in a stressful
environment or archer,

62
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:52,900
you know, I started started archery
recently. You did? Oh yeah. Yeah.

63
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,140
And so that's one of those things
where you've got to learn to detach.

64
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:59,740
You gotta learn to pay attention
to things that are going on.

65
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,580
If you're all caught up in the moment,
then you're going to miss it.

66
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,880
So that's number one.
If you want to learn to deal with stress,

67
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:10,030
put yourself in stressful situations
that are under some kind of control.

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,060
You know,
even something like a paint ball,

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,170
you know we do gigs and echelon front
where we put people through what we call

70
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:20,230
FTX is where you go out
and you're going to fire.

71
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,400
We usually use air soft
because it's a little bit more,

72
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,990
it's a little easier to work with.

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,460
But actually what we started using now
is we've got these high end laser tag

74
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:35,020
guns and so that's, that's what we
use and they are super effective.

75
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,610
They're there, they're awesome.
They're awesome training tools.

76
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,970
LikeW if we would have had them,
if we would've,

77
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,830
if they would've existed
when I was in the seal teams,

78
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:43,390
I would have used them then
because they're that good.

79
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,340
So we use those and we put people in
stressful situations. Go hit this target.

80
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,020
There's bad guys, there's, you
know, people are going to get shot.

81
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,290
There's people yelling.
Put yourself in stressful,

82
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,820
stressful situations and learn to detach.

83
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,900
Put yourself in stressful situations with
the purpose of learning to detach and

84
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:03,370
stepping back mentally to figure out
what's going on. Okay, that's first part.

85
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,130
Next part is how do we make good
decisions? Well, number one,

86
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,340
making correct decisions. You've got to
study, you got to know and understand.

87
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,360
You've got to know the background,

88
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,990
you've got to know the historical
outcomes of equivalent type decisions that

89
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,130
have happened in the past,

90
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,670
similar situations and if you know the
history and you know the background,

91
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,260
then you can use those to assess
the current situation you're in.

92
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,110
And then once you assess the
decisions that you can make,

93
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,720
assess the possible actions
that you can take Admin,

94
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,150
assess the outcomes that
those decisions will have,

95
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,940
those actions will have.
And when you're doing that,

96
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:50,260
you also have to assess the
possibilities of inaction.

97
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
So a lot of times people forget that one,
they don't know.

98
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,650
They don't know if they should do a or B.
What they forget is there's also,

99
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,520
what if I don't do either?
What's going to happen?

100
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,050
Sometimes not doing either as good.

101
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,070
Most that were a lot of times not doing
either is bad. So you've got a or B,

102
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:08,630
what should you do?
Maybe sometimes you got to pick a or B.

103
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,320
Sometimes occasionally it's better not
to do anything and you wait and let the

104
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,490
situation develop a little bit more.
What?

105
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,810
So the point of this is whatever you can
know beforehand, you know, you learn,

106
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,900
you study, you understand, you know
the standard operating procedures,

107
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,870
you know what various variations have
been made on the standard operating

108
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,920
procedures. And that's how you
go forward and you execute.

109
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:34,430
Now the thing that you have to remember
is that you can't know everything

110
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,540
beforehand,

111
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,440
which is why it goes back to study and
practice detaching and making decisions.

112
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,450
So, so now let me dig into
detaching a little bit.

113
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:47,330
Let's actually break that down.

114
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,440
Maybe some mechanical steps that
you can use. Number one, step back.

115
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,480
Like literally physically take a step
back from the situation that you're in and

116
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,960
move your head and look around.
So when we used to shoot,

117
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,550
they would teach us to scan, like you
would have to physically move your head.

118
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,170
And what that is,

119
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,740
is a mental reminder that you need to
look around and assess what's happening.

120
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,130
So once you've taken a step off the line,

121
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,950
whether that's taken a step back from
the table and you're in a meeting,

122
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,380
if you're a, if you're a firefighter
and there's a fire happening,

123
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,990
take a step back so you can see the
bigger picture. If you're in a cop and,

124
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:23,300
and there's a shootout happening,

125
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,300
where can you go to step back and get
some cover and look around and see what's

126
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:30,860
actually happening? If you're in a, if
you're in a conversation with someone,

127
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,940
stop talking. If there's an
argument going on, stop talking.

128
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:39,230
Take a step back and actually listen to
all the other elements that are shouting

129
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:43,060
and yelling at each other. If there's a
decision that needs to needs to be made,

130
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,610
I don't on a planning situation,
step back from the plan.

131
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,880
Don't just take a step back from it.
Look at it more broadly.

132
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,210
So that's step number one is to step back.
Number two,

133
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,021
then you're gonna come up with,
hey,

134
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:58,070
one of the possible decisions that I can
make. I could go this way. I B Abcd, ABCD.

135
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,810
I can do any one of these things.
Keep an open mind.

136
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,410
This is the problem. Some people have
as they come up with two decisions,

137
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:08,420
three decisions,
and they don't think about anything else,

138
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,920
so you kind of have to like repeatedly
detach. You kind of have to stay detached.

139
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,690
That's why it's good.
You throw out an idea,

140
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:18,230
like if we're planning for something and
I come up with three ideas, I say, echo,

141
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,630
what do you think of these? I give
them to you. Then I stepped back again.

142
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,130
I keep my mind open,

143
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,620
so that's why the more you can
get your subordinates to plan,

144
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:25,520
the better off you're going to be.

145
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,730
The more you can get the people below
you in the chain of command to come up

146
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,650
with an idea or come up with the ideas,

147
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:33,310
the better off we're going to be because
you're not embroiled in it. You're,

148
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,360
you're defacto detached because you're
letting them run with it. Then, okay.

149
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,460
Once you look at your decisions and
you've got to look at what the possible

150
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:41,294
outcomes are,

151
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,920
what are the possible things
that can happen is this could,

152
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:48,770
how bad could this go?
Risk versus reward.

153
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,380
You've got to weigh those things out
and you got to do it fairly quickly and

154
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,214
again,
you've got to,

155
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,680
you got to figure out what's the result
or possible outcome for inaction.

156
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,420
And then you just weigh out these various
options that you've created and you

157
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:04,380
figure which one, which outcome has the
most, which one makes the most sense?

158
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,910
That's that's what's good.
And like I said,

159
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,820
inaction is some people like any
action is better than no action,

160
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,980
not always true,
not always true.

161
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,690
Sometimes you can learn more by letting
things develop and letting things reveal

162
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,090
what the status is. So that does make
sense. And sometimes you do hold off.

163
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,950
If if you, if you can see that a
problem is getting worse though,

164
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,430
we'll then we've got to do
something then generally, okay,

165
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,130
let's make some kind of a
decision very quickly. Now,

166
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,600
one of the most important
things to remember,

167
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,180
and there's a little dichotomy to this,

168
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,070
is that you don't always
have to make giant decisions.

169
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,640
You don't always have to
make the, all the, the,

170
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:52,320
the all powerful decision of might,

171
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,990
you know, it's like, do we go or do we
not go? You don't always have to say,

172
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:02,280
we go. Sometimes you can go, well, let's
push a little further. Let's, let's move.

173
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,890
Let's move a little bit further
before we make that decision. Or, Hey,

174
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,960
let's stay where we are
and see if it develops,

175
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:10,650
or let's back up a little bit
and keep watching. So instead of,

176
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,090
we go and we don't go,

177
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,990
there's actually a bunch of different
decisions that you can make besides,

178
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:19,560
we can go or don't go. There's a building,
there's a bad guy in it. Let's go.

179
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,070
Or let's not go. No, actually, let's put
eyes on the target for a little while.

180
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,460
Let's, let's call and see if
there's any other intelligence.

181
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,460
Let's put an aircraft overhead. There's
all kinds of decisions that you can make.

182
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,480
Let's push a little bit closer.
Let's stage, let's monitor.

183
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,690
So there's all kinds of decisions
that you can make that allow the,

184
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:44,370
the situation to develop further and
maybe reveal the proper decision to you in

185
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,760
the long run.
So the mice,

186
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,900
my fear of saying that is
that people get paralyzed.

187
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,160
Where does it analyze the parallel
and parallel analysis paralysis.

188
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,150
That's my fear about saying that because
the dichotomy is you can sit around and

189
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:04,350
analyze and figure out and look at
something for over for forever while the

190
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:07,710
situation changes and now you lose.
So yes,

191
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,420
you don't have to make giant decisions,

192
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,460
but at the same time you gotta be
decisive. There's a dichotomy. I'm sorry.

193
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,550
I'm sorry. Leadership is not easy.
Wrote a whole book about it. Dichotomy.

194
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,670
Leadership. Why? Cause that's
what happens. So there you go.

195
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,230
That's my assessment of how you can
improve your decision making skills.

196
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,080
Experience goes a long way.
Yeah.

197
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,820
It's one of those deals kind of
when you were talking about the,

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,930
the results versus the,
the, the method, right?

199
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,120
Decision making thumb.

200
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,370
Sometimes like the result actually both
method and results kind of the value

201
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:47,880
isn't even in the results.

202
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,360
It's like you having getting that
experience going through it, you know,

203
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,950
it'll improve your decision. Sure, sure.

204
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,910
Yeah. Anytime you can be in a situation
where you're making decisions and getting

205
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,680
experience out or you're going
to get better at it. Yeah.

206
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,200
Kind of the value in role
playing that is a value.

207
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,260
That's why we do a lot of role playing
in echelon for like a little thing and

208
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:09,130
people might think, oh that, how does that
work? Come and get it. Totally get it.

209
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,860
I watch people all the time,

210
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,780
it totally improve as leaders because put
them through a role play scenario as a

211
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:21,370
leader where they're going up against a
combative subordinate or a subordinate

212
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,450
that's lazy or I subordinates angry or
a subordinate that that wants to leave.

213
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:26,081
Like you put it,

214
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:28,870
you put a person in role playing in
those situations over and over again and

215
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:31,540
they get so much better.
Three iterations,

216
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,900
three iterations and people
are exponentially better
at handling situations.

217
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,830
Yeah. Cause it's like some, I
mean most of the time anyway,

218
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:44,650
it's just a matter of them
like never seen it before.

219
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,950
And then in the during game time it's
Kinda like you got to make the decision

220
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:52,120
super fast that you can't analyze
from the role playing situation.

221
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:55,640
You can analyze, you can do whatever and
then t and then learn it. No a great,

222
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,420
I actually should have brought that up.
That's a great point.

223
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,990
Is another way that you can get better
at making decisions by roleplay for sure.

224
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,880
Give yourself the options.
Put, get put yourself,

225
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,350
set yourself up a pressure situation and
have people role play it out with you

226
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:11,080
of what you're going to do. Yeah,
so it's kind of like like mock,

227
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,350
that's basically what it is.
It is mock experience.

228
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:16,030
That's basically what seal training,

229
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,370
well not the basic seal training
but the seal training that I ran,

230
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,760
that's basically what it was. We're
going to have people act like bad guys.

231
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,670
You're going to make decisions all day
long. That's a roleplay. Get some. Yeah

232
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,390
and again going back to like just seeing
it once right is seen at one time is

233
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:34,030
the D is way bigger difference than then.

234
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,330
I mean compared with never seen
it all versus seen at once.

235
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,360
The difference between that is way bigger
than seeing it like twice versus once

236
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:45,070
you know, if you seen it once, it's Kinda
like, okay, now I know. Yeah, it's, yeah.

237
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,930
It's like night and day.
It's night and day.

238
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,980
The difference between
knowledge and like, no, no, no.

239
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:55,270
Knowledge is crazy. If we see
that over and over and over again,

240
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,330
like an Indiana Jones and the last
crusade. You ever seen that one?

241
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,960
I'm pretty sure. Wait,
how old is that one?

242
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,620
Like I saw the all like that
series when Connor was a kid.

243
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,160
I think I seen it. So at the end,
and they go through things, right?

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,800
That they're like these booby traps.
Right, and he'd get the holy grail.

245
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,630
That's what they're doing.
Oh,

246
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:19,240
that I've seen this one because everyone
in the guy's face melts, right? No,

247
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:22,540
that's great. It's the last song
when they opened the Ark. Oh,

248
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:26,260
you got to shut your eyes. Yeah.
That's old school anyway. No, this one,

249
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,010
they have to go through these,
like these tests or whatever.

250
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,140
They're their booby traps
to get to the holy grail.

251
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,550
And one of them was you have to kneel.

252
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,720
Only the penitent man will pass. That's
what it says. And the grail diary,

253
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,310
which is Indiana Jones Dad's
diary that took all the notes.

254
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,470
And so he's like, Oh, you've
got to interpret that. Right.

255
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,290
So they had all these people,
there were bad guys there too.

256
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,190
So they just send someone in there

257
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,420
and then the guide go in and
his head gets chopped off.

258
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,980
So you go in there, you know, hey that
blade is going to come chop off my head.

259
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,170
Cause I seen that one guy
get his head chopped off.

260
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:06,740
I'm just gonna duck just one time.
It's,

261
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,570
I got to know the blade's going to
come out dunk. Thanks Indy. Granted,

262
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,530
granted there was more booby traps and
you kinda got to refer to the grill diary

263
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:19,490
for the answers subject to
interpretation by the way. But same deal.

264
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,110
He see the point though, right? If
you walk through a hallway, get it,

265
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,000
then you see the guy get his
head chopped off, you know. Okay,

266
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:30,770
I better duck down your best
doc. Yeah. Yup. I get it.
Thank you. One time. One time.

267
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:35,000
That's all it takes. Anyway, next
question. How do you practice normal fee?

268
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,060
So same.

269
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,360
And the reason that group these two
questions together is because there's a

270
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:43,230
little, there's some similarities there.
You know, how do you practice normal face,

271
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:47,280
which is a legitimate skill
by the way. Yes sir. It's,
oh, it's funny. Little game.

272
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,410
If you haven't heard of what you do is,
I used to do this for my kids.

273
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:52,410
I put line them up and if they made any
expression whatsoever besides just a

274
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,400
normal plain face,

275
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:58,290
I'd hit him in the head with a the inside
cardboard roll up of a wrapping paper.

276
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,200
So there's, there's the game and it's
a lot of fun. We'd have fun doing it.

277
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:02,034
Everyone would laugh.

278
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,790
Well it's also useful in his adult to
do be able to not show your emotions.

279
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,900
So how do you do it?
Same thing.

280
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:14,670
Put yourself in stressful situations
and you know, a good one is Jujitsu.

281
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,350
Jujitsu. If you can just like act normal,
even when someone's just crushing you,

282
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,040
then that's a positive thing. It's like,
you know, sometimes you and I are rolling.

283
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,420
Yes. And you'll be like, oh,

284
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:27,760
I felt a sense of urgency is
that's when I lose normal.

285
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,600
It's failure to keep normal face a little
bit scrambled because you're going to

286
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,560
pass or something like that and then you,

287
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,920
then you feel all good because you made
me react, you broke my normal face.

288
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,200
So yes,
that's good.

289
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,890
I would say the thing about
normal faces practice it all time.

290
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:47,220
You know where you practice it,
you practice it like when you're driving.

291
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,610
I mean I can't do this anymore because
when we started this podcast I would get

292
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,750
questions all the time about road rage.
How do you prevent road rage?

293
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,590
How do you permit roadmap?

294
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,230
I think everyone's so in the game
now that there they figured it out,

295
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,740
but that's a good anytime where
there's something bad happening,

296
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,190
like something annoying.
Something like the line,

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,830
the line at the DMV, the line,
wherever and you just just,

298
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,170
just keep normal face and
just act like whatever.

299
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:18,171
Detach and he'll just act normal in
Jujitsu when you're in between rounds.

300
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,430
Don't act tired. Yeah.
That's like one of my,

301
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,580
I try and maintain that rule all the time.
You

302
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,380
taught me that, oh, I don't even
know if you meant to teach me that.

303
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,670
And I told this story before but I would
roll up, you're going to hear it again.

304
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,940
We'd roll and I be tired of whatever
after rolling with you. And then you know,

305
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:40,610
and people do this all the time and
it sticks. It's like a red flag to me.

306
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:43,370
Not a red flag warning of
it just sticks out a lot.

307
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:46,790
When people do this after
the round, they'll just flop
on their back and be like,

308
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,130
you know, like breathing all hard
kind. Just you know, indicating

309
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,210
that, Whoa, that was a tiring
round. Right? Yeah. You
need to have tire grounds,

310
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,691
get it kind of thing.

311
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:58,650
And then this is the message that you
conveyed to me through your actions.

312
00:17:58,651 --> 00:17:59,550
You didn't tell me this,

313
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,910
so I wrote a few and I do that or
something along those lines. Right.

314
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,530
And you like stand up,
not breathing through your mouth.

315
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:09,180
I remember that you're just like,

316
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,870
you know like mouth closed and then you
were looking at me almost like you're

317
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:17,070
disappointed in me. Came back. Yes.

318
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:21,150
I realize you probably were and you said
you look a little tired and then you

319
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:25,980
just walked away.
Like almost like that was the bad part.

320
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,590
The the part that I looked tired that that
was like the bad part you didn't like.

321
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:33,930
And I was like from literally from
then on I'd act like I wasn't tired in

322
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:38,340
between. Even if I was tired, I've tried
to act like I'm not tired actively.

323
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,710
That's so important. It's
important in life. Yeah. You know,

324
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,710
it's important as a leader it's more
way more important as a leader than

325
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:50,430
anything else when you
start to break things. Well,

326
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,860
I don't know if you have any examples,

327
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,070
but like I think of times in my life where
I would see my leaders start to break

328
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,790
and just think like how horrible that
is for the rest of the team and I'd be

329
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:04,690
looking at a leader that was
breaking. I'd be like, man,

330
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,890
you aren't letting everyone down
and you're not going to do it to me.

331
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,290
I'm going to, you know what? Actually
this is an opportunity for me.

332
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,090
If you're looking weak, I'm not going
to get all aggressive, but I'm going to,

333
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm going to make sure that people aren't
going to follow that attitude because

334
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,420
that is going to hurt us
all. Yeah, so as a leader,

335
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,010
normal faces even more important.

336
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,760
I'm not saying you never showed
emotions at this dichotomy.

337
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,770
I'm not saying never show emotions as
a leader because you absolutely do show

338
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:31,200
emotions as a leader,
but you make sure that they're controlled.

339
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,780
You make sure they're not emotion,
negative emotions.

340
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,510
So am I saying to not
be yourself? Yes, I am.

341
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,410
Because if your self is being a week a
week loser and you're in charge of a team

342
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:49,830
and you show everyone that you're wrong,
no, you need to stifle those emotions,

343
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:53,100
which we've talked about before. You
just stifle those. You need to act.

344
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,370
You need to act like, hey,
we're going to make this happen.

345
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,140
This doesn't mean lie to them. This
isn't like a, hey, the boat's sinking,

346
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:05,550
but don't worry, we're, it's
going to be okay. No. Hey,
guess what? Boats sinking. No,

347
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:06,930
we're going to do,
we're going to break out.

348
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,340
A life jacket is going to form into pool.

349
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,920
We're going to grab whatever
we can off this pastor.

350
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,130
We're going to make sure we get, you know
what I mean? As opposed to boat sinking,

351
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,380
right? Yeah, it's true. So you lead check.

352
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,390
So if, um, what like when your
kid falls down, right? Yeah,

353
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:25,800
totally. Totally. Like, oh my gosh.
Are you okay? Yeah, no negative.

354
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,040
Yeah. Wait. Oh, how's
it? I was at the park.

355
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,830
My son two climbs up high on this thing.
It's like,

356
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,880
it's slanted a jungle gym kind of thing.
It's just slant it.

357
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:38,730
It's like pretty high where it's not like
so high that he shouldn't be up there.

358
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:39,990
It's not that,
but it's,

359
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,600
it's high where you got to keep
an eye on that thing right there.

360
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,160
And sure enough,

361
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:49,161
he takes a step or whatever and just
straight up falls to the ground and the

362
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:53,650
ground is ah, the ground was like a
bunch of this weird hey kind of stuff.

363
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,460
So it's, it wasn't like concrete,
put it that way, but he fell down,

364
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,420
pull on and the kind, you know, looking
at other parents who are looking at it.

365
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:03,120
My wife is sitting right next to me.
We've kind of far away me,

366
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,950
literally grabbed her like, don't run
over there. And um, my daughter was there,

367
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,650
she's super caring too, so I'm like,
ah, I should have grabbed her too.

368
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:15,370
But she's far away anyway, so he
falls down. Of course it doesn't cry.

369
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:19,630
He's more like surprised and stun and
looking around almost with the look on his

370
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:23,710
face. Like, how should I react to him
now? That's exactly what he's doing. Yeah.

371
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,700
And then, yeah, it's all good. I mean,

372
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,720
yeah, my kids would take a digger,
I'd start laughing you don't like,

373
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,640
oh, that was awesome. Yeah, it makes
sense. And they're like, really? Yeah,

374
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,250
that was awesome. We got little
Skinner. Nice. Look, you're bleeding.

375
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,470
That's going to leave a cool scar. You're
awesome. Welcome to the club. Yeah,

376
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,640
that's a good one. Like so like that's
awesome kind of thing. I'll be like, oh,

377
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,110
I stand up strong, hurry up, hurry up.

378
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,280
Like kind of like you got to beat it and
like show me how strong you are kind of

379
00:21:57,281 --> 00:22:00,190
thing. Oh, I did that the
other day nonetheless. Yeah,

380
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:02,440
so he got up and he didn't cry.

381
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,180
Of course he goes to high
asphalt to injury. He landed
correctly. How many feet?

382
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,290
It was taller than I stand, so,
so we're talking to seven feet.

383
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,510
Seven, six, six. Yeah. Over over bigger.

384
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,530
Yeah, it was. It was
solid, but he landed good.

385
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:23,200
Like if you would have landed on his head,
that's an injury straight up.

386
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:27,490
But he felt like good, which is
lucky. But yeah, nonetheless. So yeah,

387
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:31,300
the point is if I were to who it like
ran over there, something like this,

388
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,920
it would have jammed him up. Oh yeah.
Isn't that why the airline pilots,

389
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,260
when you get turbulence,
they're like, hey everybody,

390
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:40,300
just go ahead and buckle your seat belts.
We're,

391
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,240
we might feel a little bit more that you
know, instead of, hey guys, we're good.

392
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,220
Yeah, I very much appreciate that when
we do that, by the way. All right,

393
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,750
next question.
Next question.

394
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,460
I tell the team we need this
done by 3:00 PM they say got it,

395
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,990
we'll have it done by 3:00 PM but they
don't deliver on time and tell me,

396
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:06,991
well we didn't know we needed it done
by 3:00 PM how do I take ownership of

397
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,720
this? Yeah, this is it.

398
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,730
This seems like a tough question,
right?

399
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,060
But it's actually not that tough of a
question because what you think is like,

400
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,360
well they said they were going to get
done then they didn't get it done.

401
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:20,990
Then how could that be my fault?
Right.

402
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,550
And maybe that's not how
the question is meant,

403
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,150
but that's the way I'm interpreting
it for the purpose of this answer.

404
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,840
True cause maybe you just meant like,
hey, how do I take ownership of this?

405
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,450
And if that's the way he meant it,
fine. The answer is the same actually.

406
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,120
So what happens is if,
if it happens,

407
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,730
what happens is if that
happens with your team,

408
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,320
then you take ownership of it by
recognizing that you did not communicate

409
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,010
effectively.
Because if your team

410
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,620
isn't doing what it is you need them
to do, that is actually your fault.

411
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,520
As the team leader,

412
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,270
they either didn't understand
how important it was or
they didn't understand how

413
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:54,710
solid that deadline was

414
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,800
or they didn't understand that when you
said this thing needs to be completed by

415
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:04,790
three o'clock that you meant completed
by three o'clock maybe it's cause you

416
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,750
usually say,
hey,

417
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:08,720
we need this done tomorrow at two and
you give him slack and they just kind of

418
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:12,230
take advantage of it, blah,
blah, blah. Then you know,

419
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,130
if you want to take ownership of it,
maybe you didn't follow up enough, right?

420
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,960
Maybe you trusted them too much.

421
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,120
Whose fault is it if you trusted
him so much that you just let them,

422
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,260
you showed up at two 59 is it done?
Well, no, we didn't think it was due.

423
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,580
Like we didn't know you needed an action.
So whose fault is that? It's your fault.

424
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,870
You trusted them too much, maybe you
gave them too much leeway, right?

425
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,600
Maybe you give them too much leeway, too
much decentralized command, dichotomy,

426
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,360
leadership. Maybe you went too far with
decentralized command. You said, hey,

427
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,550
if get this done by three o'clock
for out however you want to do it,

428
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:41,960
I'll be back at two 59

429
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,020
and you roll out and that's not done.
So what do you do?

430
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,380
You come back at three o'clock
it's not done. Did is your fault?

431
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,630
Do you take ownership of it? You say
to your team, look, hey, okay, so how,

432
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,830
how do you take ownership of
it? Cool. You fixed the problem.

433
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,050
How do you fix the problem in
this case? Well, guess what?

434
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,990
Next time I tell you something is not
done at three o'clock I'm going to check

435
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:05,030
in with you.
I'm gonna check in with you a few times.

436
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,400
Here's the progress that we want to make.

437
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,830
I don't want you to be here by this point.
I want you to be here by this point.

438
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:10,850
I want you to be here.
That by this point.

439
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:13,960
And that puts us on track to finish
well ahead of three o'clock. Yeah.

440
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,980
So let's make it happen. Are you going
to micromanage a little bit more? Yes,

441
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:21,860
you are. They missed a deadline.
You're not allowed to miss deadlines.

442
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,700
Not Allowed to miss deadlines. Do I
micromanage you? Echo Charles? No.

443
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,380
Have you ever missed a deadline? No. Well,

444
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,320
there's been some hot gas that didn't come
out on time, right? Yeah. I guess the,

445
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,460
depending on the lunch
meat, I guess. But yeah,

446
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,250
there's been some podcasts that
didn't come out on time. Yes.

447
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,840
And I would send you a text like,
hey,

448
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,650
just wondering if you knew about a
podcast that was supposed to come out five

449
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:47,910
hours ago that happened one
time. Well, no. Two things.

450
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,450
I think it's happened two
times. One of them. Yeah.

451
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,670
So you don't warrant
micromanagement cause you,

452
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,760
we've done 147 podcasts and you've
had two that weren't out on time.

453
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,840
Do I need to micromanage?
You know, I don't. Don't need
to because we're all good.

454
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:08,540
The podcast. Hey, occasionally the
times that they didn't come out,

455
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,610
one of them was like straight up
operator error where you were like,

456
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,180
I didn't press the button publish
or something really lame like that.

457
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,870
The other time it was like major
technical difficulty. We got a problem,

458
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,870
it's going to be a couple of days.
Then there was another time.

459
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,770
What was the other time when we went
to Maine last year and what happened?

460
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,940
We just got there.

461
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,290
The on the night that I was supposed to
publish in my mind was just distracted

462
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:38,090
by the new, I had lost my camera. It
was a crazy time for everybody. And uh,

463
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:41,660
you know, the next morning
you still um, you know,

464
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,130
graciously posted a picture of me sleeping

465
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,100
on the plane by the way,
and said movie.

466
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,930
So working to Ecuador
publish a podcast publicly,

467
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:53,400
which is complete violation
by the way. Take a picture
of me sleeping. A fun. Yeah.

468
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:53,920
Yeah,
it was,

469
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,810
it was actually completely warranted
because it really captured like what it

470
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:00,090
felt like.
I just totally spaced it out.

471
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,900
So my point is you get stuff done on time.
You have a good track record there.

472
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,110
No need for micromanagement. If you
were, if you were hitting a lower number,

473
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,800
if every, you know, once every
once a month, it wasn't on time,

474
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,800
you'd be hearing about it
all the time. For me, I'd be
like, Hey, we good tomorrow.

475
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,550
We good?
Yeah,

476
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,780
I'd be checking in with you until you
got so mad at me following up with you.

477
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,830
You would just be like,
hey,

478
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:25,200
I got this and you would never miss
it again because you didn't want to be

479
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:28,350
bothered. Right. So for this one, again,

480
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,260
it's important to remember that
with the idea of extreme ownership,

481
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,670
it's not just like, oh well
I'll say this is my fault. No.

482
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,950
When you're in charge of a
team and something goes wrong,

483
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,560
it actually is your fault.
It actually is your fault.

484
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,073
And that's all there is to it.

485
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,770
Maybe there's some people you
need to fire because they are the,

486
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,810
they're at fault for this
mistake happening and you've
let it go too long and

487
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:55,470
you didn't get rid of him. That's your
fault. But it actually is your fault.

488
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:58,410
How do you take on or how do you take
ownership of it? You fix the problem.

489
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,510
Maybe you got to,
in this particular case,

490
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,810
maybe you've got to step up
the micromanagement. That's,
that's the way it works.

491
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,500
Yeah,

492
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,500
it makes sense also to the W and I'm
speaking from a perspective of someone who

493
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,770
could very well easily space out this
project by 3:00 PM by the way, that's,

494
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,530
that's potentially me. But this is,
this is when it can't happen. Um,

495
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,300
where let's say I get a list of like two
or three things, whatever I gotta do,

496
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,580
right? Like, Hey, we, you
know, we want this or whatever.

497
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,170
And then let's say it's not necessarily
by 3:00 PM let's say it's like by next

498
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:31,591
week,
Friday.

499
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:36,330
So I got a week and a half to do these
three things and then the next day

500
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,340
there's like another list of two things.

501
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,190
Then the next day after that one
things is, hey, you know what?

502
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,400
This is the priority. Three days
later after Lisbon establish, hey,

503
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:47,580
this is the priority. Get this done first.
Then you got one more thing. All right,

504
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,650
so this thing that I said, yeah, got it.
I'll have it done by Friday kind of thing.

505
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,370
She sorta get shuffled in
forgotten, you know, like forgotten.

506
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,420
So maybe I didn't organize it or what's
your point in saying this is putting

507
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:03,180
yourself on report? Are you saying
that you need to make a list?

508
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,150
Are you just saying you need to write
things down? People that miss things,

509
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,030
you know you do your write them down.
I used to make little boxes.

510
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,040
I'll show you some of the checklists.
You come to my house,

511
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,460
I'll show you checklists. I used to
make their, I mean we're psycho OCD,

512
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,490
little checklists, little boxes next
to like I would be going on a trip.

513
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:20,220
I would make a little box socks,
t shirts,

514
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,320
everything. Every single thing I
was taken I would have on a list.

515
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:27,460
I still got those lists.
I got bit deployments from the,

516
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,680
the nineties of what I took on deployment.
It was pretty legit right there.

517
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,670
Little boxes,

518
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:37,320
little boxes in the 90s they were written
down on paper in the two thousands I

519
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:42,190
got the computer. I print those
things out. Note App. So, hey,

520
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:42,511
you haven't,

521
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:45,820
you will have problems if you personally
are telling me that you have a problem,

522
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,410
you've got to write something
down. Yeah. So yeah,

523
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,340
and obviously you know mean
you're different. I don't
have those kinds of notes,

524
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,850
but what I'm saying is uh,
yeah,

525
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:58,540
like that could be your methodology of
your micro quote unquote micromanagement

526
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:03,130
style for things like this. Just make
sure they got it kind of thing like yeah,

527
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:06,430
for sure. Things, I'm thinking about fact
there could, you can, you can give lists.

528
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,320
I normally wouldn't have to do this,

529
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,580
but sometimes there's been a couple times
in my life and career where I'd have

530
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:15,760
to give people a list like, hey, I
hate the boxes for them. Like, Hey,

531
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:19,720
here's what you got to get done today.
Make sure we understand each other.

532
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,270
I would only do that if they
drop the ball a couple times.

533
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,850
Like all they didn't get this done
that he'd get that done. Okay.

534
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:28,810
Guess what I need to write down and make
sure it happens. Yeah. So yeah. And again,

535
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:32,560
it's not like, Eh, I'm not saying it's
not my fault cause you give me too much.

536
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:36,550
I'm not saying that. I'm saying like
not everyone, me, I'm talking about me.

537
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,880
Not everyone's as organized as maybe you,
you know,

538
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,890
so they're going to need
some micromanagement in this
particular way. You know?

539
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,990
Maybe cause maybe that's it.
I mean I think the tone here,

540
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:50,270
the question could be me
totally could be made mystery,

541
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,690
but it kind of seems like, hey, they
said they got it and they didn't get it.

542
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:58,650
What more do you want from me?
Kind of thing. You know the banker.

543
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,090
That's a good way of putting it and then
I just gave the list of what more you

544
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:04,480
can do. Yeah, exactly. You can spell
it out for him. You can micromanage,

545
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:07,920
you can check and do checkins with
them. Do all those things. Yeah.

546
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,510
Very good.
Next question.

547
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,220
The question you must have strong
feelings about current events and politics

548
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,020
generally given your experience yet
you remain silent on this issue.

549
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,243
Why?

550
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,200
To appeal to a larger audience or the
soldier's mentality of not criticizing the

551
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,150
commander in chief? Is that, why

552
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,640
do I have strong feelings on
current events and politics?

553
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,270
Uh, sure I do, but

554
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,550
they're more broad.

555
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,580
So I have very strong broad feelings
on current events and politics.

556
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,840
I am a patriotic person.

557
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,870
I believe very strongly in
individual freedoms of human beings.

558
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:56,310
I believe in having a
very strong military,

559
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,620
I believe in having a small government.

560
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,240
So I have strong feelings
about those things. However,

561
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:10,330
I don't have strong feelings about the
nonsense and micro dramas that are on the

562
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:15,770
24 hour news cycle that are
just content and social media.

563
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:20,390
Just constant things. I know we
talked about this a lot, last podcast,

564
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,860
things that don't matter.

565
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,850
So much of the current events don't
really matter in the big picture to me or

566
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:33,710
even to the country.

567
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,430
And you know,
I was uh,

568
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,050
on Ben Shapiro show and you know, he
was, I basically said, look, look,

569
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,280
like be overall Americans have sort
of the same goals. And he said,

570
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:49,010
I don't know if I believe
that. And I said, well,

571
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,890
I work with all kinds of companies
with people all over the country,

572
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,050
and the people that buy a guy
like Ben Shapiro, here's from,

573
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,483
he's just,

574
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,840
he's just bombarded by the
extremes on both sides,

575
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,980
24 hours a day.

576
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,080
I don't want to be in that position of
getting bombarded by these extremes 24

577
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,640
hours a day. I said, Ben, you're right.

578
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,390
There are some people in the country that
believe the far left or the far right.

579
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,691
I said,

580
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:22,520
most people are concerned about their
life and doing a good job and you know,

581
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:25,160
building their business or do you know,

582
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,970
by paying down their mortgage,
that's what they're concerned about.

583
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,690
And so they're not like freaking out
about the little every little micro drama

584
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:39,590
that gets unleashed into the press
and social media every single day.

585
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,450
And so, so why do I not join into that?
Cause I don't want to join into that.

586
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,020
And also I don't want to make a podcast.

587
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:52,250
I don't want to spend all my time making
a podcast that's, that's out of date.

588
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:55,730
The day it comes out like I don't want,
I don't want to invest my time in that.

589
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,880
I don't want to, and guess
what? There's, there's literally

590
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,360
giant multibillion dollar news media
outlets and guess what they do?

591
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,960
That's what they do all day.
That's what they do all day.

592
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,570
They make up story about this thing and
that thing and this thing where I can't

593
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,220
react fast enough.
It's just dumb.

594
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,370
So if we were to be talking
about current events,

595
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:19,580
then by the time the podcast comes out,
the parent event has been over,

596
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:24,290
some people are listening to this podcast
and it's, it's, it's 2022 right now.

597
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,160
Right now.

598
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,810
Some someone is listening to this
podcast right now and it's 2022 no,

599
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,970
there's, there's no topic of current
events that we could talk about. Oh,

600
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,450
barely any that actually impact
what's happening four years from now.

601
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:43,490
People, I meet people every day now I
meet people that, that say, Hey, oh man,

602
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:47,210
I've been listening to
podcasts. I'm on 28. Um, that's,

603
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:51,800
that's two years ago, right?
That's two years ago. What was the,

604
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,330
what was the current events two years ago?

605
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,780
They were totally different
than they are now. Yeah. So,

606
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,881
so there's that.

607
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:02,990
So that's why little current events
thing as far as appealing to a larger

608
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:06,590
audience, that part of the question, well,

609
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:08,690
if my goal was to appeal to a large,

610
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,660
larger audience than I think I actually
would talk about the trending stories of

611
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:15,650
the day and put out little little
clips of soundbites of all this stuff.

612
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:18,260
And instead of,
instead of doing what I do now,

613
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:21,500
which is to read a hundred
year old out of print books,

614
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,620
like that's a great way
to build an audience,

615
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,970
or let's talk about the Rwandan genocide
or let's talk about the Holocaust,

616
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:29,330
or let's talk about the rape and Nan King,

617
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:32,720
or let's talk about the mee Lai massacre.
That ought to build a great audience.

618
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,800
So, so the idea that, oh, I'm trying to
build a larger audience. It's like, no,

619
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,590
actually people that want to
listen to this one to listen to it.

620
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to
build an audience by manipulating what,

621
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:48,180
what I'm thinking about.
No, I'm actually, I'm,

622
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,690
I'm talking about and I'm diving into
what I find important and what I think I

623
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:58,620
can learn from and I get more out
of this podcast, isn't anybody,

624
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,340
I mean I know a lot of people say,
Oh, I've got a lot from your podcast.

625
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,690
I get more out of it than anybody cause
I get to dive deep into this stuff and

626
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,260
really look at it.
So no,

627
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,320
it's not the trying to appeal
to a larger audience. In fact,

628
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,730
if I wanted a larger yard,
large arts,

629
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:19,731
I'd do exactly what you're talking about
as far as the soldier's mentality of

630
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:23,730
not criticizing the commander in
chief over. I actually don't agree.

631
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,550
I don't agree that that's a soldier's
mentality and I don't believe that it

632
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,600
should be a soldier's mentality.

633
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:32,580
The soldier should question their
leadership and now should they do it

634
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:36,150
tactfully? Absolutely. Cause I don't
want to be surrounded by yes men. That's,

635
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,860
that's wrong. Also, if you at,

636
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:43,350
what am I trying to say? This is
just a general leadership principle.

637
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,360
What am I said a thousand
times on this podcast?

638
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,700
I'm trying to build a relationship
with a person above me in the chain of

639
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:50,280
command.
So when I was in the military,

640
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,330
if I wanted to have influence over
my boss, over my commander in chief,

641
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,690
what I outwardly criticize them
and make, make them think, oh,

642
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:59,010
this guy just doesn't like me.

643
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,970
I'm going to take my first chance to
get rid of them or not promote them. No,

644
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,680
I'm actually going to play the game and
I'm going to look and say, okay, boss,

645
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,080
Hey, I see what you're doing here.
I want to support what you're doing,

646
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,910
but does this make sense?
Can we do it a different way?

647
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,550
So I'm trying to build a relationship
with my boss up the chain of command.

648
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,540
I'm not trying to ostracize him by,
by making them look bad,

649
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,430
or by openly criticizing my boss
in, in, uh, in, Oh, in the open,

650
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,640
because what have I done? This is
my boss going to listen to me. No,

651
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,090
actually my boss isn't gonna
listen to me at all. So

652
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,170
yeah,

653
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,440
I don't want to be surrounded by yes men.
But at the same time,

654
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,790
if someone's making a bad decision,

655
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,560
if someone's doing something
that's a moral or legal,

656
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:38,910
I'll call him out on it all day long.

657
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,510
Now the other thing that happens here
is this is a new world and it's a bar,

658
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,280
and this is a binary world of sound bites.
That's what we've done.

659
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:54,930
We've created this binary,
binary world of sound bytes.

660
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,740
When most answers that you want to give
as a human being aren't one sentence or

661
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:06,381
two sentence on the far left or far right
or far light or far dark like there's

662
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:07,020
going to be,

663
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,020
you have to explain things a little bit
more and but when you take these binary

664
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,493
soundbites,

665
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,760
everyone's immediately thrown into an
extreme category on the far left or the

666
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:21,570
far right, and as soon, and here's the
bad part, here's the really bad part.

667
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,290
As soon as you get thrown
into one of those camps,

668
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,340
then have the other camp stops
listening to you completely. Yeah,

669
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,750
they stop listening to you.

670
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,680
Anything you say so you could,

671
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,970
you could make a great point,
but if you're on the other side,

672
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,070
doesn't matter.
No one's listening.

673
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,710
They don't want to hear it because you're
on the other side. You're the enemy.

674
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,850
It's a binary world.

675
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,050
You're either with me or against
me and there's no in between.

676
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,480
So that's kind of what we've created and
what I would rather do is have people

677
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:55,990
actually listen to what I say broadly
and make their own choices rather than me

678
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:59,260
trying to force an opinion down
their throat. This is the way it is.

679
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:01,420
This is the way it should be. And
by the way, just like leadership,

680
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:04,540
you can't force people. You can't
force an opinion down someone's throat.

681
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,050
If it doesn't work, you can't.
Sure it'll work for 30 seconds.

682
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,630
It'll work for five minutes and to work
for five days in a leadership position.

683
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:14,230
Yeah, you better do what I say
my way's right. Eventually you,

684
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:16,210
that kind of leadership does not work.

685
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,000
And it's the same thing with trying to
force an opinion down someone's throat,

686
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,620
throat.
If you listen to what I'm saying,

687
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,980
you can form your own opinion and I would
rather have you do that because that's

688
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,920
going to be stronger than some opinion
that I tried to force down your throat.

689
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,320
Yeah.
Which doesn't work by the way.

690
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,020
So I would rather people listen to me and
not just sound bikes and see where I'm

691
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:41,950
coming from holistically and see where
they can agree and disagree and see what

692
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,960
feedback they give me.
Because by the way,

693
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,990
I could be wrong about something
which I have no problem with.

694
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,700
But I would rather do that.

695
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,770
I would rather have that
approach then join the pack,

696
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,800
whichever pack that has joined the pack
on the street and bark loudly like the

697
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:02,800
rest of the dogs.
I have no interest in doing that.

698
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,900
So there you go.

699
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,380
Thank you.

700
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,100
And it's funny, man, you're,

701
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,180
you're like one of the few people
who don't even know, you know,

702
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,010
like that whole thing.
I mean to sum that up,

703
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:22,380
I mean I've heard that before where
someone would be like, Hey, I'm, you know,

704
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:25,980
I'm like this one. But it's so
it's so few people that actually

705
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,860
do that the way the way you do, even in
real life, like in real life, like he,

706
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,620
you don't,
even when political stuff will come up,

707
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,490
it's real obvious that you didn't
jump in to any specific group.

708
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,140
Yeah.
So this,

709
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:44,880
this really ties back to last week's
podcast of getting involved in things that

710
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,980
don't matter.
And there is,

711
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,730
there's just so much out
there that doesn't matter.

712
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,820
Now where you have to be careful is that
that there's so many things that don't

713
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:01,500
matter. But what I am not saying
that little things don't matter.

714
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,190
You see what I'm saying? There's a huge
disparity between those two things.

715
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,350
There's a lot of things that don't matter.

716
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,940
What I am not saying is that little things
don't matter because there are little

717
00:41:11,941 --> 00:41:15,660
things that do matter and the classic
example that we brought up over and over

718
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:18,450
and over again on this podcast,
it's like, oh, the Russian soldiers,

719
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:21,990
not shaving and Chechnya and how
that led to there eventually. Okay,

720
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,820
not gonna Shave now.
We're not gonna clean our weapons now.

721
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,920
Now we're not gonna stay awake on a watch.
Now we're not going to execute.

722
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:27,990
The missions were being told to do.
Now we're getting beat.

723
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,170
There are little things that matter,

724
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:36,020
but if I'm barking day long
about things that don't matter,

725
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,030
then we have a problem. We have a
problem now I'll tell you something else.

726
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,010
There has been some issues
that have come up lately.

727
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,460
There was one issue that I was going
to address on the podcast, but,

728
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:52,190
and I still might address it because it's
a small problem that I see as being a

729
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:57,191
more significant problem and
if it continues down the road,

730
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:01,240
but luckily at this point there's,

731
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,820
there's a whole pack of dogs
barking about it. It wasn't like,

732
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,640
it wasn't like I noticed this problem.
No one else saw it. It was like,

733
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,660
I noticed this problem,

734
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:12,770
so did millions of other people and
they all those dogs start barking. Okay,

735
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:16,460
so now what am I going to do? Good
bargain with them. It's like, okay,

736
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,640
now if there comes a time where all of
a sudden I realized there's one of these

737
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:25,910
small things that matter or a big things
that matter that I don't see getting

738
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,380
the traction that it needs,

739
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,880
well then I will absolutely say,
Hey,

740
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:34,010
this is what I think about this situation.

741
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,970
Generally there's so many people barking
and they're barking about the same

742
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,740
thing. They're barking about a
lot of things that don't matter.

743
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,480
They're barking about some things that
matter and right now, unless, I mean,

744
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,580
what do I say all the time you,
the less, the less you speak,

745
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:50,750
the more people listen.
Yeah.

746
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,340
So if I want to give my my
opinion on the Daily News,

747
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,370
every hour on the hour, no one's
listened to anything I've got to say,

748
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,620
and then it's a waste.
It's a waste.

749
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,600
It's a waste of my time
because there's more important,

750
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,850
there are more important
things when we can,

751
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,570
when we can dive into human
nature through the lens of war,

752
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,620
through the lens of leadership,
through the war of a traffic.

753
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,880
If we can learn and teach people about
the past so that we can prevent it from

754
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:14,714
happening in the future.

755
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,870
That to me is infinitely more impactful
than barking about some current event

756
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:24,950
that's happening. That's going to be
gone in a week. It's amazing how far,

757
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,840
how fast stuff comes up on the radar.

758
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:31,070
It's all over the headlines and in a week
it's gone. In a week it's gone. Yeah.

759
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,480
So I just not going to play
that game. I have. I don't,

760
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,580
there's no point in doing it.
That's a really good way to put it.

761
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,020
It's like these current events,

762
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,740
most of the time seem to be shaped in
a way to just for dogs to bark about,

763
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,570
you know,
what it is like here and then,

764
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,960
then the bark and the next thing you
know. Yeah. Okay. Mark about this now the,

765
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:58,970
the sound bite thing is really interesting
too that everything is a sound bite

766
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,960
and it either puts you in one camp or
the other camp and the fact of the matter

767
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,120
is you can't put me in a camp.

768
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,200
You can't cause I got beliefs
that you don't understand.

769
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,630
On one side. On the other side.
Yeah. You know, and so what?

770
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,890
You can't talk to me about
that kind of thing. You can't,

771
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,960
not that you can't talk to me,
you can't put me in a camp,

772
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:23,170
but the instinct of the world right now
is take that person and put him in a

773
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:26,060
camp. I'm not going to the
camp. That's what's happening.

774
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,680
If you want to figure it out,
what I'm thinking. Listen,

775
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,880
what I'm saying about listen to what
I'm saying in hundreds and hundreds and

776
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,320
hundreds of hours where I talk
about human nature, right?

777
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,770
If you want to figure that out and then
you want to ask me a pointed question

778
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:44,840
about something cool. Ask. Bring it. If
it's something that's going to, if it's a,

779
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:47,370
if it's a bark,
if you want me to bark about something,

780
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:48,450
I'm probably not going to bark about it

781
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,370
for what? Throwing you in a camp. All
you'd have is a whole lot of unhappy

782
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,990
be campers. No, you throw me in a
camp. If you put me in one camp,

783
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,710
the other camp doesn't listen
to anymore. Yeah. And that,

784
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,110
and that means their minds are closed,
so they're not going to,

785
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,530
and is the fact of the matter is there's,

786
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,220
there's good people in
both camps know and,

787
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,420
and both people can be,
can be,

788
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,920
can change and come can accept
new ideas if their mind is open,

789
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,940
if their mind is open, they're
just staying there, camp
and everyone else. I mean,

790
00:45:24,941 --> 00:45:29,140
when you watch the extremes of either
camp right now, it's, it's like,

791
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:33,630
it's like really, it's, it's bizarro
world. That's kind of odd. Yeah. So you,

792
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:37,300
you just sit there and say, okay,
what, why am I going to play that game?

793
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,680
Let's just become better people that
understand people better and will make

794
00:45:41,681 --> 00:45:44,080
better, make the place,
make the world better.

795
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,280
Can't disagree. Okay. Yeah.

796
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,370
The whole unhappy campers though than me
more than making a joke. I dig it. Yeah.

797
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,540
No, it was a good attempt at humor. Well,
actually, no, it wasn't. It was a failure,

798
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,070
but that's cool. Oh, what was
the other point you made? Uh,

799
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:05,230
sometimes it's better to just, just try,
you know, and, oh, the whatever thing.

800
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I know. And then
now, you know, don't try that again.

801
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,870
No more jokes from Echo Charles.
Learn from my mistakes. Anyway.

802
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,700
Next question. What is the best way
to break through a plateau in Jujitsu?

803
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,610
I'm stuck doing the same moves against
the same training partners that have the

804
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:25,450
same moves done to me beating the same
guys and getting beat by the same guys.

805
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,463
What should I do?
Yeah,

806
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,530
what should he do? Well, I'll
tell you what I would do.

807
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,840
Go on a crazy training binge. Yeah, take,

808
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,220
take a week off from work
and train eight hours a day.

809
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,720
Just get crazy it.

810
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,970
Make sure you're healthy and then take
a week off and train eight hours a day.

811
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,080
Like nuts.
That's number one.

812
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,370
Number two, you could also opposite.
Take a short break, take a little time.

813
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,360
Don't take a long break. Take a little
step back. That's another option.

814
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,930
Another option is only start working on
certain moves. Like only utilize one,

815
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,270
like, okay, so every time
you get a arm lock from the
bottom of you, you got to be,

816
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:11,200
you're a guard player. Don't
play golf anymore. Yeah.

817
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:14,500
Don't click guardian more a start.
Just look,

818
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,440
I'm not going to play guard every time
I'm going to come up and I'm going to get

819
00:47:17,441 --> 00:47:20,140
us, I'm going to go for a single
leg from the bottom like dean does.

820
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,510
I'm gonna do that every time
until I started making it work.

821
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,510
That's what I'm going to do.
And if I get choked a thousand times,

822
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,670
that's fine cause I'm going to
get better at it eventually.

823
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,340
And other thing is
trained, like, you know,

824
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:32,500
you get your little click of
training partners at your gym,

825
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,650
starched the training with some of the
other people that have different body

826
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:37,870
styles and big different body shapes.
So you get used to,

827
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,860
you have to bring out a new part of your
game. The first one that I talked about,

828
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,220
training binge eight hours a day.

829
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:49,560
I know it's hard for people to
actually make that happen. The w the,

830
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,230
The Times that I've done that,
the first time I did it,

831
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:57,130
I actually do is at the time
that I taught the, uh, the Jocko,

832
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,340
the Jujitsu for off fence,

833
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,420
the Jujitsu offense for combat
killing operations Jacko course.

834
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,230
And I trained these guys.
It was a small group,

835
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:11,620
it's like five of us and we trained all
day and one of the guys was equivalent

836
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:15,370
to me. Uh, Dan, he was like,
we were both like blue belts.

837
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,100
And so we normally,
we were teaching people,

838
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:23,101
but we were training long and like my
Jujitsu visibly got better in a five day

839
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:29,920
period because I trained super
hard for five straight days.

840
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,280
So that's a cool way. You could
probably do it for a weekend, you know,

841
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:36,190
probably just like a three, take a Friday
off trade Friday, Saturday, Sunday,

842
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:41,150
eight hours a day, work on some stuff.
Yeah, be careful, you know, because you,

843
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,230
you get your over use injuries and
or do you get, when you're tired,

844
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:48,030
you're more likely to get hurt. So you
got to use a little caution. But yeah,

845
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,060
those are some good ways to break your
plateaus in Jujitsu, which we all,

846
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,680
we all hit one way to know that
you're breaking your plateaus,

847
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,450
you're going to get worse first.
You're gonna get, you're gonna lose,

848
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:01,030
you're gonna lose to some of these
guys that you have been tapping because

849
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:04,480
you're trying something new. Yeah, yeah.
That is an indicator for sure. Yeah.

850
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,841
The,

851
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:09,841
I like the do certain moves or omit
certain loose cause like it's a natural

852
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:13,240
thing where like you, when you're,
you're, when you're ascending, right?

853
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,650
When you're getting,
when you're training,

854
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,360
you kind of settle into a certain type
of game, you know? So maybe, yeah.

855
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:20,440
You like to play guard a lot.

856
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:23,260
Maybe like to get the triangle from the
guard a lot. That's your kind of go to,

857
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,820
you know,
where it,

858
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,000
it becomes sort of this almost like a
muscle memory kind of thing where it's

859
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:28,690
like boom,

860
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,730
you'll pull guard your routine in a role
no matter who you're going against it.

861
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,870
It's real similar all the
time. Right. Um, so yeah,

862
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,560
if you start omitting that stuff
where it's like, okay, I'm not,

863
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,870
I won't go for that triangle anymore.
I'll play guard,

864
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:44,050
but it cannot do the triangle.
So it forces you to do other stuff.

865
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,350
And then sometimes depending on your
experience, you might have two, three,

866
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,570
four go tos, right? So you still,

867
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:53,680
you still kind of trapped in that same
plateau by if you just omit one move.

868
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:54,640
So in that case,

869
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:57,430
you think of a move that you might
notice other people getting a lot,

870
00:49:57,431 --> 00:50:00,520
not necessarily on you, but you know,
just in general and be like, Hey, I'm,

871
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:03,880
that's all I'm going to do. I can't
get any other submission. I can't,

872
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,360
I can only do, I don't know the
Guillotine for example. Right.

873
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:10,180
Let's say you just don't do
guillotines that much or whatever.

874
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,210
I know you can't relate to
that, but you say, okay,

875
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:17,320
I'm only going for guilty if I'm like
in my guard. I can't really like,

876
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,180
I can't really get a guilty tunes from
the guard or whatever it put it this way.

877
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:23,200
If you're not good at Guillotines,

878
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,070
that'll force you to find ways to
get the guilty. It'll just force

879
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,410
you. And then if you do
that for one thing that we,

880
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:34,640
I would say maybe even like three months,
maybe in six months,

881
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,720
Brian Sergeant was like, Hey, yeah,
like I what I did I cause he liked,

882
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:43,070
he likes to play on top, smashed from the
top. He's like, I had it for six months.

883
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,160
I just didn't play on top. Well that
might've been you who said that? I Dunno.

884
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,830
One of you guys said that that
definitely happened with me. Yeah.

885
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,920
It definitely happened with me. I
didn't like being on the bottom. Yeah.

886
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,750
And then I just had to just like,
okay. Yeah. No sweeps allowed. Um, no,

887
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,160
like starting from the top. If you're, if
you're starting to pull guard, that's it.

888
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,430
Like, no, that's your rule. And
that's the thing. It's hard to like,

889
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,690
it's hard to come to training unless
you have this plan in your mindset.

890
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,280
It's hard to come to train and be like,
you know what?

891
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,390
I think I'm going to just only play
guard today if like you don't like garden

892
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:18,110
cause it's like I don't want to get
like tapped out everybody, you know,

893
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:21,200
especially when you just got your
purple belt or something like this.

894
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,130
It's hard to do that. But yeah,
if you just make up your mind,

895
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:26,480
kind of think of it long term,

896
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:30,170
like I'm playing the long game here and
just only go for that certain move that

897
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,600
you want to get good at it.
That's all you're doing. It'll,

898
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,380
that'll bus you plot pass
the plateau easy. It'll,

899
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,490
I don't know about easy way
to walk through your plateau,

900
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,850
but I think that's a very high probability
that you'll, you'll get past it.

901
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:49,250
And also, uh, just not easy cause you
just, it's more of your plastic plateau.

902
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:54,260
Easy. It's not easy. Yeah.
But it was actually hard.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And I did,

903
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,360
I just do, I just want to make sure
people aren't like, Oh, you know,

904
00:51:56,361 --> 00:51:59,310
Echo said to just try one move and then
it's going to be easy to break them. No,

905
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,550
that's actually not true.
That's actually hard to, it's a,

906
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,560
it's hard to not just resort back
to what you're good at and B,

907
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,590
when you don't resort to what you're
good at and you get your ass kicked on a

908
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:12,660
regular basis,
which is not fun and easy,

909
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:18,410
and that easily could be the two main
challenges of going through Jujitsu

910
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,760
journeys. Those two things.
Yeah. Arguably, yes,

911
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,940
you are right. Correct.
That is absolutely correct.

912
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,740
If that's what you mean by easy,

913
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,920
what a kind of sorta meant was you'll
the probability of breaking pastors have

914
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,720
surf spot that I surf at.
Yes.

915
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,900
And one of the ways to get out of
the water is dangerous book fast.

916
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:48,860
The other way to get out
of the water is mellow,

917
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:54,070
but it's a longer walk and I was surfing
with my buddy stoner and he's like,

918
00:52:55,850 --> 00:53:00,380
Hey, which way is it easier to
get out? And I said, well Bro,

919
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,470
it depends on which is why he's here.
Yes sir.

920
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,490
Because one of them's not more than
a few steps. Once you're good. Yeah,

921
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,290
we're getting good. Is getting to
that point is it is a challenge.

922
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,840
The other way is real easy,
but it's a long walk.

923
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,660
So it just depends what you mean
by easy. Yeah. So I mean to me,

924
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,790
probability wise,

925
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:26,010
let's say if you chose to break through
your plateau by going to another gym to

926
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,430
train with all different guys,
that will get you past your plateau.

927
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,620
But I think if you did this thing where
you omit a certain move or you just add

928
00:53:33,621 --> 00:53:34,321
a move,
they not good.

929
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:37,320
And that's the only way if you did that
and really committed to it correctly,

930
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:42,270
which is hard by the way mentally. But
if you did that, I think, I think you,

931
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,320
the probability of you breaking pass
your plateau and ending up at a further

932
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:50,570
place in regards to progress is
much higher if you did that. Yeah,

933
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,850
that's what I think. And that's what I
meant by easy, which I guess, yeah, that,

934
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,820
Gosh, I'm gonna use the word easy.
Depends what you mean by using scratch.

935
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:02,520
Watch me also, uh, do tournament
plenty. If you do a lot of
tournaments, bro, you'll,

936
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:07,320
you'll bus bus pass the plateau. Yeah.
Weaknesses will be exposed. Yeah.

937
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:11,460
And it's like you'll, you're mine would
be way more at ease in training too.

938
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,620
It'll be like more open. It's weird for
sure. I think so. Anyway. Next question.

939
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:21,420
How do you apply the principle of building
a relationship with your boss when

940
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:24,660
your boss doesn't value relationships,
for example,

941
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:29,661
he consistently avoids interactions that
don't lead directly to a deliverable on

942
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,740
a current objective.

943
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,640
He avoids all other interactions such
as those that are for the purpose of

944
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:38,110
building relationships and
chemistry within the team. Okay.

945
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,810
What would I do in that situation?

946
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:43,570
While the Nica obviously what I would
do is I would build a relationship based

947
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:47,740
on deliverable current objectives,
right? If that's what he's into,

948
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,900
I'm going to make that happen.

949
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,340
Like I'm going to be the guy that he
thinks can get this to happen and that's

950
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:56,650
what our relationship is going to
be based on and I'm fine with that.

951
00:54:56,651 --> 00:55:00,070
When he wants to talk about work, I will
talk about work. I had bosses like that.

952
00:55:00,071 --> 00:55:04,150
I had plenty of bosses like that and
what do you do when you have bosses like

953
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:08,140
that and play the game like, okay, we're
going to, let's just make this happen.

954
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,250
Let's do this

955
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:16,620
now let me say this beat beat
because he isn't personable.

956
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,460
This means that you have
to be more personable,

957
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:26,490
not so much with him but with the rest
of the team because there is a lacking

958
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:32,100
element within the team that you as a
good team player and team member and

959
00:55:33,101 --> 00:55:37,630
leader, whether you're in a positional
leadership or just a human leader,

960
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:43,650
you can improve the team by building
some of that human connection that bonds

961
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:45,850
the team more so.

962
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:51,570
Even though my boss is in personable
and is just about the business and just

963
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:54,400
about the current objective,
that's fine with me.

964
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,270
I'm going to do my best to support him
and make him realize that I'm going to

965
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:02,560
got the guy that's going to make those
objectives work and I'm going to build

966
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,280
the human connection with the rest of the
team which will make our team stronger.

967
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:11,610
Now I am not going to offend my boss by
being the guy that is more popular than

968
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:17,380
him.
Some people have some,

969
00:56:17,381 --> 00:56:20,170
some people that have the attitude
that this individual's talking about,

970
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,550
what would you call this person? Um,
just just a hundred percent work focused.

971
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,740
So if I've got a guy
that's 100% work focused,

972
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,090
sometimes that kind of boss finds
the person that wants to chat.

973
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,450
Annoying. Right? Unknowing

974
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,030
which is possible. So you don't
want wanna you don't want to be,

975
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,980
you don't want to annoy the
boss and he thinks all this,

976
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,190
all this guy joggle he just wants to
build friends. He's not here to work. No,

977
00:56:46,191 --> 00:56:50,000
you gotta be careful about that. And,
and, and the weird thing is, honestly,

978
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,950
I'm very work focused.

979
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,070
Okay.

980
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:57,460
I'm very work focused and I have to like,
I don't really have to do anymore,

981
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,630
but I used to like, I'd have to
consciously think about, okay, on top of,

982
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,210
actually I still do have to do it.
Sometimes you don't like,

983
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,490
I have to consciously think about like,
okay,

984
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:10,730
I also need to like be nice and build
relationship with the person that I don't

985
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:17,460
normally interact with. Right?
So you, you do have to do that.

986
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:22,470
So form the relationship with the rest
of the team, the good relationship,

987
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,940
and then form the best relationship that
you can with the boss and that is going

988
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:28,350
to help the whole team. That's
it. It's as simple as that.

989
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,350
And I'll say one more thing about this.

990
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,210
Yeah.

991
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,990
You don't get to pick your
leader generally. You don't
get to pick your leader,

992
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:42,490
but you can pick the relationship
that you have with your leader. Yeah.

993
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,740
So what your leaders into, let's get in
the game. Let's build a good relationship.

994
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:50,370
Uh, once again, if someone's
out there thinking, oh,

995
00:57:50,371 --> 00:57:52,260
so you just want me to kiss ass.

996
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:56,460
What I'm saying is not that I
want you to kiss ass, I'm singing.

997
00:57:56,461 --> 00:57:58,830
I want you to win.
That's what I'm saying.

998
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,080
Because the better relationship
you build with your boss,

999
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,700
the more influence you have over them,

1000
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,950
the better chance you
have of getting promoted,

1001
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:07,620
the better chance you have
of of accomplishing the
mission and taking care of

1002
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,180
your team. That's,
that's the way it works.

1003
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,880
Why don't want to get promoted so I
can get more money for myself. No,

1004
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:14,100
I want to get promoted so I can do the
mission so I can take care of my team.

1005
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,660
That's why I want to get promoted.

1006
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:21,210
If it was just about like taking care of
myself, I wouldn't go work for this guy.

1007
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:23,310
I'd go find another job
and pick a different boss.

1008
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:27,060
Cause you do get to pick your boss, you
can quit your job, quit your day job.

1009
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,023
So that's what you do.

1010
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:35,070
You build that relationship
hard as it is gets up. Yeah.

1011
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:35,581
That's a good point.

1012
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:40,080
With the d with the kind of the details
of it where you can't just start trying

1013
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:44,380
to chat the guy up. He doesn't like
that. Yeah. No one does actually. Yeah.

1014
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,900
Even if you're a social person,
but you're for,

1015
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:48,090
let's say you're just focused
on something, you know

1016
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,790
and I dunno, you focusing on in your
friend calls you and you're like,

1017
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:57,300
oh well they called me. It
might be important. Yeah, yeah.

1018
00:58:57,301 --> 00:59:01,050
And they're telling you about, you know,
the episode of whatever last night.

1019
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:04,440
And he was like, Bruh, I'm working right
now, but I don't watch TV. Call me again.

1020
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,370
Oh yeah, now you're going to step
step further than I had in mind.

1021
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:09,900
But I'm just saying that that's
annoying no matter who you are.

1022
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:13,520
So if you're thinking, you
know, this boss is like, he,

1023
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,900
he doesn't like to quote unquote build,

1024
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,030
build relationships and like all this
stuff, he's only then you're going to,

1025
00:59:18,031 --> 00:59:20,550
you written, you run that risk of
annoying them. Yes. You've got to be a,

1026
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,490
make a big step back,
dichotomy,

1027
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,850
dichotomy, dichotomy. But there's little
end. Usually it has to do with time too,

1028
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,850
you know?
So if you go in and you just go,

1029
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:32,780
just little digs of like relationship
building stuff but not, don't take,

1030
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:35,180
don't go in there and be like,
hey did you catch the game last night?

1031
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:39,680
Didn't do that. Like I don't care.
I can stop. But you know, I dunno.

1032
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:44,130
Nice tie, boom out, you know,
kind of thing. I Dunno. Don't
say nice to, I don't know.

1033
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,370
Next question.

1034
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:51,370
The guy that's high level worker does not
want to hear about his tie is not care

1035
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:56,100
about his time. Yeah. But it actually
is noise. A lot of people. But yeah.

1036
00:59:56,101 --> 01:00:00,020
And I don't know how to get it in the
corporate scenario. I think my whole life.

1037
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:01,910
But yes.
So I don't know,

1038
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,180
that just seemed like something on the
movies and long finger about your shirt.

1039
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:11,360
No, it wasn't corporate though. The night
club leadership. Yeah, same for sure.

1040
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,530
And the point is,

1041
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:17,000
there's things you can say that don't
take up his time and necessarily his full

1042
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:21,440
attention to annoy him that you can
say or do. That's what I'm saying.

1043
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:25,490
I don't know what that is cause I don't,
I don't know. I don't work with you guys.

1044
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,270
Check. Next question. Hey Jocko,

1045
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,440
my boss is trying to implement.
I say postulates highlighted my boss.

1046
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,600
I don't know why it's,
it's highlighting all my bosses

1047
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,270
works man. Somebody was talking about
on social media how you said, ps,

1048
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:49,330
you're like, I went to the grocery
store, I got some peas, you know

1049
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,490
it's a variable. Then
nonetheless, escalation.

1050
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:00,580
Sure my boss is trying to implement a
process that I see the end result not

1051
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:06,740
being what is needed and I have proposed
an alternative that is proven and will

1052
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:07,700
add value to the company.

1053
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,960
Do I give up trying to position to get
the outcome we need or do I commit to

1054
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:18,740
help implement his process and wait
for the outcome then try it again.

1055
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,960
It is a relatively small failure in the
big picture outcome but would like some

1056
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:29,240
input on how to get the
results we need longterm.

1057
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,550
Very cool question and

1058
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,470
so yeah, you've got a scenario where
your boss wants to do something,

1059
01:01:35,471 --> 01:01:39,310
you know you got a better idea that
will work better. What do you do? Well,

1060
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,820
first of all, any way that I
can make my idea and his idea,

1061
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:46,150
that's what I'm gonna try and do. So
you have to be careful, and again,

1062
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:47,950
I don't know what your boss
might be an open minded person.

1063
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:49,560
If you've got a good leader, you
go in there and say, hey boss,

1064
01:01:49,561 --> 01:01:51,460
this is what you're trying to make happen.
I think this will work better.

1065
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:54,280
And your boss May, Oh wow, that's a
great, that's a great idea. You know what?

1066
01:01:54,281 --> 01:01:57,850
Let's go with that. There's, there's
leaders out there that make it happen.

1067
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,090
You're probably not asking this question.
If you have that kind of boss,

1068
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,460
you're probably talking about someone
that has a little bit more ego,

1069
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,730
thinks they thinks they know a little bit
more and not really open minded to new

1070
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:07,510
ideas.

1071
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:11,770
And that's why making your idea into
his idea is going to be a better option.

1072
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:16,810
Don't try and force your idea.
And one thing you do is you could,

1073
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,680
you could ask questions and
I've talked about this before,

1074
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:23,220
but like you say something
like, you know, hey, hey boss,

1075
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:25,620
I want to make sure that I'm supporting
this and the best way possible.

1076
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:28,230
So I really want to understand this fully.

1077
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,500
So can you explain this here to me
and why we're doing it like that.

1078
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:34,350
And then you know, you have a conversation
with your boss and then you go, oh,

1079
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:36,420
and maybe your boss has some good
points that you didn't understand.

1080
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,910
Or maybe that opens the door
for you to say, Hey boss,

1081
01:02:38,911 --> 01:02:41,340
the way that this other group
is doing it is like this.

1082
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:45,390
Do you think we could try that?
Or you say,

1083
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:47,910
if you want to eagle him up a little bit,
it's like, hey boss, you know, I don't,

1084
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,550
I don't fully understand this.
You know, as well as you do.

1085
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,640
Could you just help me understand
why we're doing it this way?

1086
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,310
And then once again, what you're doing
is you're starting a conversation.

1087
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,890
If you can't get the message
across in that indirect manner,

1088
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,350
you can be a little bit more direct,

1089
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:09,060
but be careful when you're direct
with people. They dig in, man,

1090
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:12,510
they dig in, especially with anyone.
If any kind of Edo Eagle, they dig in,

1091
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,290
you tell them your idea and they just,
all of a sudden they,

1092
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:20,291
they come up with reasons not to
do it and you have to be careful.

1093
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:24,150
That's why you have to use
caution when you reveal your plan.

1094
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,040
It's better to not even
review it as a year plan.

1095
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:32,340
It's better to reveal it as like an
idea and then let it become their plan.

1096
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,590
Don't reveal your emotions.
Okay?

1097
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,640
Now if all that fails and this guy
is just dead set in, hey, we're no,

1098
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:41,370
we're doing it my way. Shut
up. Echo. We're not. We're
not listening to your plan.

1099
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:43,710
We're doing it my way. Then what
you do. Yeah, you go all in.

1100
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:48,390
You support it the best of your ability.
You, you try and learn what they want.

1101
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:49,800
You try and execute what they want.

1102
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:53,700
You try and understand what they want
better than anyone else, including him.

1103
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,110
So that way you go out, you execute,
you know where all the weaknesses are.

1104
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:03,260
Now you learn and now you can come back
with a better argument or a better seed

1105
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:07,800
to plant in their head. Hey boss, I
know your plan. It's working really,

1106
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:11,040
really well. And one thing that we could
do to make it even better, I think,

1107
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:15,090
what do you think of this? If we
did x, Y, z instead of x, Y, B,

1108
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:21,360
I think it might work a little bit better.
What do you think? And then you, again,

1109
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,480
you, you plant this, you plant
the team, and maybe, I mean,

1110
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:26,670
you plant the seed and maybe
you can incorporate, you know,

1111
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:29,280
there's times where there's
times where I did this, oh,

1112
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:30,930
that's what you want to do,
boss. Cool. Got It. Yep.

1113
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:35,020
That's when we do go and do something.
Same result, get the same result,

1114
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:36,810
would do it a different way.
You know?

1115
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:41,760
It's the ask for better to ask
for forgiveness than permission.

1116
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:45,750
Yeah. Then then parish. So sometimes
it's like, it's like they began,

1117
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:47,910
we're going back to the idea
of things that don't matter.

1118
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,450
If my boss wants me to do it one way and
I can do it just a little bit different

1119
01:04:51,451 --> 01:04:54,180
and no one's gonna know and it's gonna
be all good and our results going to be

1120
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:58,410
the better or the same. I'm probably
just can be like, hey boss, I got it.

1121
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,710
And then hey bossy on the fly. We made
a little call here, we went with a y,

1122
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:06,540
B or you know, Z da. Is that as
EDB? I hope it's not, you know,

1123
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,830
bad.
But here's the results by the way.

1124
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:10,830
We did an even shorter time than
a boss goes, oh yeah, that's cool.

1125
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:11,664
It's no big deal.

1126
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,910
Cause he sees the results and he wants
to take us a little bit credit forums.

1127
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,340
So again,
what's this about?

1128
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:23,050
This is about building the relationship.
So let me ask you this. This is,

1129
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,110
this is an important for good
question to ask yourself.

1130
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,070
Will,
what will help the team more?

1131
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,890
What will help the team more?

1132
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:38,850
Will it help the team or to disrupt the
relationship and undermine the boss?

1133
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:43,410
Will that, will that help the
team? No. Will it help the team?

1134
01:05:43,411 --> 01:05:46,500
If you create an antagonistic
relationship with your boss,

1135
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,160
know that won't help your team.
Will it help your team?

1136
01:05:50,161 --> 01:05:53,160
If you build a relationship with
your boss, if you unify the team,

1137
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:55,830
if you strengthen the team and
you bring everyone together,

1138
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,750
will that help the team?
Yes. It'll help the team.

1139
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,520
Will that build the relationship
with your boss? Yes.

1140
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:00,780
It will build a
relationship with your boss.

1141
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,580
If you have a better
relationship with your boss,

1142
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,590
is your boss more likely to accept the
influence that you're throwing at them?

1143
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:09,390
Yes,
absolutely.

1144
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:15,350
So I think that's something you can ask
yourself a lot is what I am trying to

1145
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:19,380
do,
going to help the team or hurt the team.

1146
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,260
And you actually have to look at those
two in the long term, in the search term.

1147
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:25,230
Cause sometimes you do something that
hurts the team right now and it'll help

1148
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,140
the team later. Like for instance,
Hey, we're going to fire a guy.

1149
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,170
Everyone loves him, but, and
it's going to disrupt the team,

1150
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:34,230
but longterm we'll be better
off sometimes that works.

1151
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,660
Sometimes it's like we're
going to fire this guy.

1152
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,570
Everyone loves him and it's
going to be a longterm down.

1153
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,940
It's going to be a long term
detriment that you made this call,

1154
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:45,980
so you have to check yourself and check
what's going to help. The longterm,

1155
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,060
short term of the team is
going to make it better.

1156
01:06:48,061 --> 01:06:52,500
It's gonna make it worse in this case,
trying to make your plan your boss's plan.

1157
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:55,140
If you can't,
then support,

1158
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:58,170
build relationships and
influence over the longterm,

1159
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:02,310
especially cause this guy very smart to
mention that this is a relatively small

1160
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:06,540
failure, like this isn't a huge risk.
It doesn't he, you can. Hey boss,

1161
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:08,910
you know what? We got it done.
Didn't quite go come the same way.

1162
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,340
Here's where we're going.
So very good question

1163
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,490
and a question. Similar question. Yeah.

1164
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:20,340
This is why group this one together too.
We had a couple of groups questions.

1165
01:07:20,341 --> 01:07:22,050
This is one of them.
Jocko.

1166
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:26,760
I was wondering what your advice is for
disagreeing up the chain of command.

1167
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:30,450
Obviously this needs to be done
with some tact I eat in private,

1168
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,000
not in front of others,
but in those private conversations,

1169
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:37,980
how should one respectfully disagree?
Again, again, similar question.

1170
01:07:37,981 --> 01:07:42,540
A better technique than
disagreeing is just to ask
questions. You know, boss, Hey,

1171
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:44,970
I want to make sure I get this right.
Can you explain it to me again? Can you,

1172
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,080
can you watch me do it right? So your boss
actually sees what the problem is. Uh,

1173
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:54,330
that way you're, you're not
being offensive. Hey boss,

1174
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:57,180
can you explain why you chose this course
of action? I really want to learn from,

1175
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:59,280
from what you do, what
you, the way you do it.

1176
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:07,800
I again, does that sound like a kiss
ass? Yes. Cause I'm exaggerating.

1177
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,530
You know what I mean? Hey boss,
you're so incredibly smart. No,

1178
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,470
I'm not talking about that because
bosses don't like kit. Ask us if she's,

1179
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,323
or at least good,

1180
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,670
good bosses don't
actually even good bosses.

1181
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,090
They might keep their kiss asses around,
but they don't respect him.

1182
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:26,600
So you don't gain influence by being
a kiss ass. It's not a good situation.

1183
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,300
So I'm not talking about kissing
ass, but you know, hey boss,

1184
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:32,750
I'm really want to understand this and
make sure I understand it. Can you,

1185
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,880
can you explain to me why this
is the best way to make this,

1186
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,460
to do this versus the other way?

1187
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:41,060
You know that's the kind of question
that's not kissing ass. That's actually,

1188
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,070
you know what is actually
legitimately wanting to know.

1189
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:46,520
Well like I legitimately want
to know maybe what if we,

1190
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,350
instead of assuming that we
know better than our boss,

1191
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:51,200
what if we assume that my
boss knows better than me?
Let's make that assumption.

1192
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,500
And if you communicate with that
assumption then you're probably going to

1193
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:57,620
communicate in a much better way then
communicating with the assumption that my

1194
01:08:57,621 --> 01:08:59,220
boss is an idiot and I
know better than him. Yeah.

1195
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,960
Which is not a good way to communicate.
Yeah.

1196
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:08,280
Funny when you eat, now that you kind
of said that about the kiss ass guy,

1197
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:12,120
cause that comes up a lot cause I don't
want to be kissed ass and yeah you don't,

1198
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:15,420
the kiss ass guy is the same
thing as being friend zoned.

1199
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:20,580
You know what friends owned
mean? I do. It's the same
thing. Yeah. So like the girl,

1200
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:23,760
right? Typically it's the guy
who gets friend zoned. Right.

1201
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:27,630
Cause he's like two nights. He's too nice.
He's too whatever. He'll, it's, he's a,

1202
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,290
he's essentially a, you're like a
brother to me. To me. Yes ma'am.

1203
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:31,981
That's what he is.

1204
01:09:31,981 --> 01:09:35,220
So of course the girls going to keep them
around for all this like good feeling

1205
01:09:35,221 --> 01:09:38,730
superficially by the way mentioned launch,
all that stuff,

1206
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,290
all the superficial stuff.

1207
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:45,690
He's not going to get anywhere
of legitimacy with her
actual decision makings if

1208
01:09:45,691 --> 01:09:48,120
you translate that into the, you
know, working environment or whatever.

1209
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,350
Well yeah the boss,

1210
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,930
I mean a certain kind of boss just like
a certain girl is going to keep a guy

1211
01:09:51,931 --> 01:09:54,750
around for that reason.
Certain boss is going to be like,

1212
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:56,370
yeah I'll keep him around.

1213
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,820
I feel a little bit bad even firing the
guy like that a little bit cause he's

1214
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,820
just so nice to me and gives me
all these compliments and even in,

1215
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:06,510
in a weird way I think the kiss ass
guy kind of knows that too. You know,

1216
01:10:06,511 --> 01:10:06,880
like how,

1217
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,170
why would he ever fire me even though
it's not negative your job or whatever.

1218
01:10:10,171 --> 01:10:14,270
Right. Um, because you know, he can't fire
me. I'm just too nice to him. You know,

1219
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,500
there's that feeling is floating
around is what I'm saying.

1220
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,710
But it's the same deal, right?
Like it's too many compliments.

1221
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,090
You're too much of a yes man.

1222
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:25,990
I'll keep you around for very superficial
reasons, but that's it brother.

1223
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,510
You don't get past.

1224
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:31,780
Yeah, that's, and that's not a good
place to be it. No, it's not sir.

1225
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:36,040
That's why I'm not saying kiss ass.
And the way I just explained that of,

1226
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:39,100
of actually assuming that
your boss knows more than you,

1227
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:43,210
isn't is a good way to approach the
situation as opposed to approaching the

1228
01:10:43,211 --> 01:10:47,260
situation. Like you know more than
your boss. Why act like that dude,

1229
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,580
the outcome isn't going to be inferior.
The outcome is inferior.

1230
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:52,650
The outcome of,

1231
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:56,320
of acting like your boss or assuming that
your boss knows more than you know the

1232
01:10:56,321 --> 01:10:58,450
outcome is you treat them with respect.

1233
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,890
Because the other way you could try
and treat them with expects a respect,

1234
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:07,090
but inadvertently you sound
like, you know, some people
we talk about normal face,

1235
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:10,900
right? Some people they
cannot even ask a question

1236
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:17,280
in an in a respectful way, right? They
can't even, what was I saying over here?

1237
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,340
They can't even say, you know, hey boss,

1238
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:23,180
can you explain this to me
cause I really want to honor,

1239
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,080
they can't even say
that. You know, hey boss,

1240
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,760
can you explain this to me because
this doesn't make any sense.

1241
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,590
You know what I mean?
Like they can't even,

1242
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:32,960
they can't even ask a question
in a respectful way. Yeah.

1243
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:37,500
That's a skill you should master
as a leader and as a follower,

1244
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:42,000
as a leader and as a follower.
How to ask questions and respectful way.

1245
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:46,860
Lafe pointed this out. Lafe pointed
out, we were talking about the fact of,

1246
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:51,780
of, I would say it's a story he's told a
bunch of times of going through the kill

1247
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:55,860
house and he's in the back of the train
and you shouldn't be in the back of the

1248
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:57,870
train. You should be somewhere
where you can lead everyone.

1249
01:11:57,871 --> 01:11:58,710
Cause when you in the back of the train,

1250
01:11:58,711 --> 01:12:00,630
you don't know what's happening in
the front of the train of assaulters.

1251
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:04,650
A big group of people moving through
gills and I didn't and he goes, you know,

1252
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:08,340
Jocko didn't say, Hey, stop doing
that and do it this other way is that.

1253
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,570
He asked me questions and he's like,
they were real questions. I wasn't like,

1254
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,090
Hey leaf, why the hell are
you in the back of the train?

1255
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:18,660
Is that a respectful question? No, it's
not a respectful question, but it's like,

1256
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,360
hey leaf w what are you doing
in the back of the train?

1257
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,280
This is a respectful question.
I,

1258
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:26,730
I'm actually assuming that maybe life
who doesn't have the experience that I

1259
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:29,790
have, who's my subordinate as
a platoon commander. To me,

1260
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:33,600
the big task unit commander, my assumption
is not that I know more than him.

1261
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:35,550
My assumption is that he's
got a reason for that.

1262
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:39,000
My assumption is that he knows more than
me. Yeah. Which, well, this is one of the,

1263
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:42,420
one of Jordan Peterson's 12
rules for life. It's like a,

1264
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,570
I think it's assumed the person that
you're talking to knows more than you.

1265
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,020
What I'm saying is the same thing
up and down the chain of command.

1266
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,070
You assume that your
boss or your subordinate,

1267
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,440
no something that you
don't know and if you can,

1268
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,940
if you can ask questions in that way,
instead of asking questions, boss,

1269
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:03,210
what do we do in this for or life?
Why are you doing that?

1270
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,960
Like why are you in the back of the train?
That's stupid. No, it's like, Hey, wait,

1271
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:09,000
why are you in the back of the
train? What do you, what does it,

1272
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:13,170
what is your purpose of being back there?
I genuinely, genuinely want to know,

1273
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:17,490
and this isn't like, I'm not even
saying I'm acting like that. I truly,

1274
01:13:17,491 --> 01:13:19,680
genuinely want to know what the deal is.

1275
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:25,670
So make the assumption up and down
the chain of command that your boss,

1276
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,330
your subordinate,

1277
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:32,370
knows more than you and then
ask good questions with true,

1278
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,370
genuine curiosity that you
want to know the answers to.

1279
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,190
It's a good way to go about it.

1280
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:45,180
Next question.
I'm a young warehouse manager.

1281
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:49,350
That takes ownership for anything
and everything that goes wrong.

1282
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:54,420
This seems to offend like coworkers.
How can I fix it?

1283
01:13:55,950 --> 01:14:00,760
Um, okay. Classic Dichotomy.
Leadership quest shred there.

1284
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:04,860
You've gone too far. That's what's
happened. You've gone too far.

1285
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:10,320
So what you have to be do,
what you have to do is don't be offensive.

1286
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:14,020
When you take ownership,
when you take ownership,

1287
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:18,370
you can't be offensive.
When you take ownership.

1288
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,360
Some people get offended by that. So when
you say, Hey, you know what? This is mine,

1289
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:27,280
I got this. That bothers
some people when you say,

1290
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:30,160
you know what,
this is my fault and I'm going to fix it.

1291
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:35,110
That even that offend some people.
What the tone? Just the tone of like,

1292
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:39,490
no, this is my fault. I got this. And
you do that three days, three times,

1293
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:41,620
four times, five times and
all of sudden cause oh what?

1294
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,320
Everything's his fault and as
he's got to fix everything they,

1295
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:45,790
he doesn't think I can fix it.
Right.

1296
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:49,810
You can offend people
with all kinds of stuff.

1297
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,270
You don't have to work
very hard to offend people.

1298
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,030
I mean there's people get offended
when you say something nice to him,

1299
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,460
you know what I mean? You know
what I mean? I was watching, uh,

1300
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,433
I met,

1301
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:08,650
I met the ever seen the yoga dude that
does like yoga videos. He's got red hair.

1302
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:09,670
His name was spears.

1303
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:15,220
I met him just randomly getting
off a plane, but he's, he what?

1304
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:20,020
I spears or Sears? Sears. I think it's
serious. Maybe speak, what'd I say?

1305
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:23,990
Spears. I don't know because I
know the guy though. Yeah, he's

1306
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:31,150
very funny guy. Very cool guy. And I
was, once I met him, I was laughing.

1307
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,400
I was checking out a couple of videos,
but one of them was,

1308
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:36,500
you know how to be offended
at all things. And it's, it's,

1309
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:41,290
it's hilarious because that's
exactly what people do.

1310
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,450
People,
some people can get offended by anything.

1311
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:47,890
So that's what you got to watch out for.

1312
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,840
Even when you're taking ownership,

1313
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,460
people can actually be offended
by that if you go too far.

1314
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,690
So instead of overtly stepping up and
taking ownership in this particular case,

1315
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:03,730
then you can tell what's going on here.
My brother here, young warehouse manager,

1316
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:07,510
he's fired up. He wants to make things
happen. He wants to get after it,

1317
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:11,140
and so what does he do? He's like,
Oh, I read extreme ownership.

1318
01:16:11,141 --> 01:16:12,190
I'm going to take ownership of everything,

1319
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:15,700
and that's a great attitude to have except
for you can offend people when you go

1320
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:18,700
too far because you got to read the
second book that I got into leadership so

1321
01:16:18,701 --> 01:16:22,360
that you can, you can balance that out
a little bit. So instead of saying like,

1322
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,120
Hey, this is mine, I'm going to take
ownership of this and make it happen.

1323
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:29,470
Instead you look and you
say, Hey, you know what?

1324
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:32,860
Do you want me to take care of
this? Oh, hey, you know what?

1325
01:16:32,861 --> 01:16:35,110
That's probably in my department.
You want me to take care of that?

1326
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,620
So that way or like,
hey,

1327
01:16:38,621 --> 01:16:40,810
it seems like this should be
something I should take care of.

1328
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:45,130
You want me to handle that
instead of me, me, me, me.

1329
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,900
I got to ask the question the
other day at a Q and a in the core,

1330
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:52,930
the question started off with the
person started the question with,

1331
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:58,240
I've got the mode, I've got the question
that everyone in here needs answered.

1332
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:03,350
So, so, so out of the gate I was like,
okay, so we have a situation here, right?

1333
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:07,210
Because that immediately tells you
that in that person's head they've got,

1334
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,800
they've got the question
that needs answered.

1335
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:14,570
So there's already an ego scenario
happening like out of the gate.

1336
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,970
So same thing here. You
don't know if you're going to
touch someone's Egos, right?

1337
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:22,880
So when you say, look, this is
my deal and I'm going to fix it.

1338
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:25,580
Like some people will take
offense to that. So again,

1339
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:30,230
you soften those a little bit. Try and
give credit up the chain of command,

1340
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:30,950
right?

1341
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:35,030
Try and give it credit down the chain of
command instead of all take ownership.

1342
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,770
It's like, hey, we got w, what did you
say? We when, when credit gets doled out,

1343
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,550
get past that credit on, pass it to
your peers passage, your subordinates,

1344
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:47,900
pass it to your boss.
So that's it.

1345
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:51,920
Take ownership. What you need
to do at this point, young man,

1346
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:56,870
is take ownership of being offensive.
And when you do that,

1347
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:01,040
you're going to be less offensive.
You're going to be more covert. A guests,

1348
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,340
remember I said earlier, like you
don't get to pick the boss. You,

1349
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:07,370
you don't get to pick your boss,
you,

1350
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,220
but you get to pick the
relationship you have with it.

1351
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,560
You don't get to pick your, your peers.
You don't get to pick your subordinates.

1352
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:17,310
You get your team, okay.
Hey, can you pick them? Yes,

1353
01:18:17,311 --> 01:18:19,410
you can quit your job. Can you
hire the right people? Yes you can,

1354
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,930
but look what you got is what you've got.
You've got to work with them.

1355
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:27,030
You don't everyone up, man.
I wish everyone was more
fired up like I am. Like,

1356
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:29,430
that's not going to go well.
You know,

1357
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,000
it's great that you wish that
that's not going to go well.

1358
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,650
What you have to do is you
gotta you gotta, you gotta.

1359
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,680
Here's another one. This is
similar, right? Millennials.

1360
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:48,020
Well, Hey, one of the things that, what
are the things, this is a very simple,

1361
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:51,470
I've done, I've done the millennium
questions a thousand times and you know,

1362
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,470
the Vietnam veterans, the Vietnam
draft, these compared to them like, hey,

1363
01:18:54,471 --> 01:18:57,740
we can talk about that again. We
don't need to. But if you've got a,

1364
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,420
if you're in charge of millennials
and you think to yourself,

1365
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:07,510
millennials thinks everything's,
they think everything
centers around them. What,

1366
01:19:07,511 --> 01:19:09,320
what do you do as a leader?
You know what I do as a leader?

1367
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:12,440
I make everything centered around them
and then they perform and then they get

1368
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:13,940
after it.
And as they grow up,

1369
01:19:13,941 --> 01:19:16,760
they learned that everything doesn't
send around them. But I bring them there.

1370
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,940
But why? Because I formed a relationship.
Why? Because I listened to him. Why?

1371
01:19:19,941 --> 01:19:20,870
Because I understand them.

1372
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:21,993
Hmm.
Hmm.

1373
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:27,080
So you don't get the team that you want.
You don't get the boss that you want.

1374
01:19:27,081 --> 01:19:30,860
What you do is you play the game up
and down the chain of command and form

1375
01:19:30,861 --> 01:19:34,100
relationships up and down the
chain of command that you want.

1376
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:37,550
What relationships do you want
from up the chain of command?

1377
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:39,590
You want them to listen to you.
You want them to give you what you need.

1378
01:19:39,591 --> 01:19:43,220
Do you want them to get out of your
way and let you do the mission?

1379
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,820
What about down the chain of command?
You want them to support what's happening.

1380
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:49,610
You want them to get after their job.
You want them to step up and lead.

1381
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,313
That's what you want.

1382
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:56,800
If you have an antagonistic relationship
because your millennials think

1383
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:59,210
everything's about them,
well then guess what?

1384
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,210
You're not going to be able to have any
influence on them. Any real influence.

1385
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:04,220
You can have the imposed will on them

1386
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,273
[inaudible]

1387
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:10,380
but the imposed will is a
is a paper tiger, right?

1388
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:14,400
It's not real. It only lasts when you're
there and guess what they're doing.

1389
01:20:14,401 --> 01:20:15,450
They're looking for another job.

1390
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:22,950
So take ownership of being offensive
and be less offensive and more covert.

1391
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,090
And you know what bro?

1392
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:28,050
Young warehouse manager keep getting
after it and it will pay off.

1393
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,260
And the fact that you're fired
up and you're crushing it,

1394
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:35,760
crush it with a little bit more tact and
you're going to one day you're going to

1395
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:37,530
be making it happen.
Yeah.

1396
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:41,680
We got time for one more question.
Yeah.

1397
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:46,840
To add though, a little tip, I think that,
I think you taught this too actually.

1398
01:20:46,841 --> 01:20:51,610
I realized this one I embraced
extreme ownership. You can't say, Hey,

1399
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,970
I'm going to take extreme ownership of
this. Like it's, it's one of those things,

1400
01:20:54,971 --> 01:20:56,880
it's like just like taking
the high ground, right?

1401
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,640
You get in like a thing with somebody,
you can't say I'm going to do it,

1402
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:03,310
take the high ground and then
it doesn't work like that.

1403
01:21:03,311 --> 01:21:05,050
Like it just gave them the high ground.

1404
01:21:05,051 --> 01:21:06,370
When you announced that you
were taking the high ground,

1405
01:21:06,371 --> 01:21:07,750
gave it up exactly the right.
Same thing.

1406
01:21:07,751 --> 01:21:11,470
We've picked stream partnership in the
situation, so if you're a very good point,

1407
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,080
I get it man, when you're
like, you know I'm taking,

1408
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,650
and he even said I take ownership of
anything and everything that goes wrong.

1409
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:21,280
Anything like straight up, he's your
guy. Right? Solely, it might indicate,

1410
01:21:21,281 --> 01:21:24,850
I'm not saying he's doing this, but he
could be going, hey guys, no worries.

1411
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:27,340
I'm taking extreme ownership
of this situation. You know,

1412
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:29,860
like if you say that kind of stuff.
Yeah, I could see that would,

1413
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:35,070
but what's odd, and this is a very good
thing to understand about human nature,

1414
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,210
everyone's jealous of you.
Everyone's jealous of each other.

1415
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:43,560
Everyone's jealous of everyone else.
No one wants you to win. Right.

1416
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:44,394
It's just like,

1417
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:49,430
so when this guy is stepping up and
the crowd starts to pick at them,

1418
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,720
they start to pick at them
and didn't want to pick them.

1419
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:55,500
They want to pull them apart.
That's generally what the
crowd wants to do to you.

1420
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,470
When you step up,
when you elevate yourself,

1421
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:02,380
generally crowd wants to pick it you or
pull you back down. Does he think he is?

1422
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,940
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So
if you were aware of that,

1423
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:11,270
then you can combat it by when instead
of elevating yourself in an overt manner

1424
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,040
where everyone can see you saying,

1425
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:18,110
I'm going to take ownership this
right now and get it solved. No use.

1426
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:21,420
If I can say, hey, you know what?
This is probably my fault. Do you?

1427
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:24,000
Do you want me to? I've let me. Let me
try and take some time and get it fixed.

1428
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:27,330
Everyone goes there actually
kind of happy. They're like,
yeah, it was your fault.

1429
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,730
They kind of, they're kind
of like, it's okay with them,

1430
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,160
whereas opposed to I'm going to take
ownership and there's this dichotomy of

1431
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:37,740
leadership. You're read extreme ownership.
Awesome. You got to read dichotomy to

1432
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:43,463
push.

1433
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:49,130
When something goes wrong, I freeze up
opposite of the know, like I freeze up,

1434
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:53,390
I get stagnant. I don't want to
move. I just asked myself, why me?

1435
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:58,760
I've tried saying good,
but it's not getting me moving forward.

1436
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:03,170
Any advice
you ask yourself?

1437
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:08,860
Why me?
So

1438
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:15,070
saying good.
That should fix your attitude,

1439
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:17,380
but that alone,

1440
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,580
that alone will not fix your problems.

1441
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:28,390
If you're having problems. Sure. Say Good,

1442
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:33,790
that's perfect,
but then don't ask yourself,

1443
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,260
why me?

1444
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:41,380
Instead ask yourself,
now what am I going to do about it?

1445
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,060
What are you going to do about?
Ask yourself that question

1446
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:51,370
and then figure it out.

1447
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:57,160
Figure out what you're going to do.
Say to yourself, I am going to detach.

1448
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,460
I am going to assess the situation.

1449
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:04,660
I am going to come up with a
plan and I am going to execute

1450
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:13,540
and then start moving. It's,

1451
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,140
it's not going to be a perfect plan,

1452
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:21,090
but take action action that moved
you in a positive direction.

1453
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,720
And if it ends up being the
wrong direction, that's fine.

1454
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,920
At least you've learned where not to go.

1455
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:34,203
Now,

1456
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:39,600
where this gets tough is if
it is something that seems
like it's completely out

1457
01:24:42,851 --> 01:24:46,150
of your control and you know what?

1458
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:50,590
Some things are completely out
of your control and that's fine.

1459
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:58,620
And when that happens, you ask
yourself, what can I control?

1460
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:05,660
What can I control that will make
this situation a little bit better?

1461
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:11,950
And then you go,

1462
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:17,930
don't get crushed by things going wrong.

1463
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:24,190
Ask Yourself,
what am I going to do?

1464
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,880
And then go do it.

1465
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:36,840
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

1466
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:39,510
So Echo Charles, speaking of, uh,

1467
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,600
moving in the right direction,

1468
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,190
I know you've got some things that can
help us move in the right direction.

1469
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:50,250
What do you got for us? Yeah. Okay,
so dude, you did too. That's it.

1470
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:51,143
That's a good one.

1471
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:55,770
So still the path has
what Ma many directions,

1472
01:25:55,771 --> 01:25:58,590
but it's all in the same general
direction. It's the improvement.

1473
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:04,370
It's improvement. There's different
roads on the path. Yes. Which is a really

1474
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:07,220
weird thing to say. Yeah. It's
more of a general thing anyway,

1475
01:26:07,221 --> 01:26:09,020
but do you just do the universal,
in my opinion,

1476
01:26:09,021 --> 01:26:13,670
I am assuming in your opinion to where
if you're not doing Jujitsu more so than

1477
01:26:13,671 --> 01:26:17,720
I would say like that's terrible.
I'm not going to say that,

1478
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:23,110
but I'm saying if you go through life and
not do Jujitsu and you're on the path,

1479
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:27,350
you might be left maybe missing out.

1480
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:30,340
You know what's really cool
about this podcast? Yes.

1481
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:34,130
And about people listening this podcast
and about people starting Jujitsu,

1482
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:39,350
this is the coolest thing. Two years
ago I would've been like, hey, you know,

1483
01:26:39,351 --> 01:26:41,090
you should try Jujitsu.
It's really good.

1484
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:47,020
But I couldn't like confirm
how universal so many people,

1485
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:48,710
I just,

1486
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,880
so many people after they take their
first class or the first nine classes or

1487
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,330
first three classes, they were like,
I'm addicted. Yeah. Why is that?

1488
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:59,750
Because there's something special about
Jujitsu, so you should train it. Yeah,

1489
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,630
that's it. Yeah. When you can
draw them. The parallel of Meta,

1490
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:06,380
it's the metaphor for life. [inaudible]
told me that early on actually,

1491
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:09,290
you know we're interested with
David Maister philosopher.

1492
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:12,900
They didn't have to take philosopher and
undergo val illustrated some points in

1493
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,710
a big one that undergo val
said that I will never forget.

1494
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:18,940
It's like you through his, like
his life, so considered Jujitsu.

1495
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:21,790
Like if you turn your back
on your problems in Jujitsu,

1496
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,500
they're going to get worse and let's
face it. That's in especially early on.

1497
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:26,750
That's how you get a guy to turn.
That's how you get a choke,

1498
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:29,990
right when you're mounted on somebody,
he slapped him in the face. What and why?

1499
01:27:29,991 --> 01:27:32,940
If you get slapped in the face of what
do you want to do, turn your back, right?

1500
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:35,060
Like, Oh, don't stop my face.
That's how you get the choke.

1501
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:39,950
So under law says and Juditha you turn
your back and you give your back to your

1502
01:27:39,951 --> 01:27:43,640
opponent. That's the worst thing you
can do. But it's hard to face some.

1503
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:46,880
Usually you got to work, you
know, same thing in life.

1504
01:27:46,881 --> 01:27:49,520
Men turn your back on your problems,
those problems and to get you,

1505
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,340
and you've heard me say
that at the monster. Yes.

1506
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,240
You turn your back on your problems, they
don't go away, they actually get worse.

1507
01:27:56,241 --> 01:27:59,600
And it's the same exact thing
in Jujitsu. Joke you. Yes.

1508
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,260
Getting per Jagers behind your back.

1509
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:06,610
So it's cool now to get feedback from
thousands of people that have now gotten

1510
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:07,940
into Jujitsu game.

1511
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:13,150
And the feedback I've got probably
I think three people out of many,

1512
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:16,490
many.

1513
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:19,220
And this isn't one of yours where you
say like a lot of people and it's like

1514
01:28:19,221 --> 01:28:21,320
four.
I'm talking to thousands of people.

1515
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:26,510
I've gotten three that don't like Jujitsu.
Hmm. That does. They just don't like it.

1516
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,290
And that's why I came up with a rule.
Okay. If you don't like it, that's fine.

1517
01:28:30,291 --> 01:28:35,291
Train at least until you've submitted
someone that's kind of equivalent and then

1518
01:28:35,301 --> 01:28:39,560
you can stop. And the reason I think, I
think that's actually, once you do that,

1519
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:41,140
you'll,
you'll understand you too.

1520
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,530
Cause sometimes you just
don't even understand it.

1521
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,540
Sometimes people just can't comprehend it.

1522
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:48,870
They count cock can't comprehend what's
happening and it's just too much. Yeah,

1523
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:53,030
it's too much. Yeah. And so
they don't want to do it. Yeah.

1524
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,880
But if you do it long enough
that you submit someone,

1525
01:28:56,570 --> 01:29:00,250
then you get that little like wow.
It's incredible.

1526
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,830
Like at the muster when you,

1527
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:06,200
when you show the connection of
two moves, yeah, this I could go,

1528
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:07,690
it's like amazing.
Oh yeah.

1529
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:11,700
And then when you try to explain that
every move is connected that way because

1530
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:16,320
that's a biggie network. But,

1531
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,580
but people don't understand
that Jujitsu is not just moves,

1532
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,600
that it's all this group thing together.

1533
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:28,380
This symphony of movement language.
That was good.

1534
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,990
Anyway.
When you do it,

1535
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:34,520
you're going to need a g cause you're
going to do [inaudible] and no Gaeton Suki

1536
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:37,440
and rash card. That's the uniform.
We'll call it a uniform. Sure.

1537
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:42,150
So you got to origin cause you're going
to get an origin g it's the best one.

1538
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:46,740
Origin, main.com or just sometimes we
forget to say that, which is not good.

1539
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,420
I feel like, I forget to say that the
name is origin. We, I say origin Maine.

1540
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,600
Oh, okay, cool. But you'll, yeah, you'll,

1541
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:58,590
you'll come to realize that it's very
obvious that origin is the only kind of

1542
01:29:58,591 --> 01:30:02,100
gate that you'll want slash need
all made in America by the way.

1543
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:05,610
The threads are me. Throw that out
there and just like, oh by the way,

1544
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:08,400
like it's made America, no, it's not
just something you throw out there.

1545
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:13,640
It's a big deal. We're
talking about Allume multiple.

1546
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:15,950
I actually, I actually had this, uh,

1547
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:21,420
so I was talking to is
actually my literary agent and
I was like, well, you know,

1548
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:24,630
like I said, it turns out, um,
you know, they're not going,

1549
01:30:24,631 --> 01:30:28,140
they can't put out Mike in the dragons
before November. So I'm just going to,

1550
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:30,950
you know, Miss, make this book myself,
I'm starting a publishing company. Yeah.

1551
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:36,150
And she's like, well, you know, a lot
of people try that. But you know it's,

1552
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:40,980
there's a lot more to it, you know,
it's really hard. Yeah. And I was like,

1553
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:44,280
okay, cool. Do you know
what a Loomis I go,

1554
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:49,281
my friends up in Maine brought a loom
back from the grave and weave material

1555
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:53,790
from cotton and nylon does so together.

1556
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,330
The loom 9,000 [inaudible]
is 9,000 pounds. Their,

1557
01:30:57,331 --> 01:31:00,420
it has 5 million threads in going into it.
It's got,

1558
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:03,570
it's got millions of parts inside of it.
It was rusted.

1559
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,320
You're gonna tell me we can't get
photocopy some stuff and put it out in the

1560
01:31:07,321 --> 01:31:11,040
book. I got this, I
got this. Don't, don't.

1561
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:14,170
And it's funny cause I told
that to Brian and Pete. I was,

1562
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:17,970
I was laughing so hard because,
because really what's, what,

1563
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,720
I don't even know if I could think
of something harder than saying, oh,

1564
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:26,721
we're going to drag a loom out of a
dam abandoned factory in Lewiston,

1565
01:31:26,851 --> 01:31:29,100
Maine,
one loom left.

1566
01:31:29,101 --> 01:31:33,420
The rest of them have been sent overseas
during the economic downturn. Oh,

1567
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:35,760
we'll just, we'll just
outsource, nevermind. Outsource.

1568
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:40,500
We're just going to send our bread and
butter our American hardware overseas and

1569
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:44,370
let someone else make it. There
was one loom left. And guess what?

1570
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,560
We got it origin.
But yeah.

1571
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:52,310
So you're telling me that we can take
this old loom that's 30 years old that

1572
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:53,101
hasn't been run,

1573
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:58,101
that's rusted and dirty and abandoned
and bring that thing back to life.

1574
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,230
You're telling me we can't print some
books and get 'em out to my people.

1575
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:06,250
You're wrong. Watch me straight up
wrong. Get some Jocko publishing.

1576
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:09,680
Yup.

1577
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,790
And that loom does not only make Giza and
rash guards, by the way, multiple looms.

1578
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:17,600
By the way. It wasn't just that they
know it was one lumen forsee in with yes.

1579
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,680
And now there's three looms. Rocking
and rolling. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah,

1580
01:32:21,681 --> 01:32:26,240
you can get shirts and joggers
and sweats, sweats, uh,

1581
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:27,163
named

1582
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:29,293
named,

1583
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,170
I dunno, but named, we'll say
named the most comfortable sweats,

1584
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,930
sweats in the world. Straight up the
joggers. I proclaimed straight up mill,

1585
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:40,600
most comfortable pencil world. None
the less. Find out for yourself anyway.

1586
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:44,020
Or did you mean.com to make a lot of
cool, good stuff. All made in America,

1587
01:32:44,021 --> 01:32:44,810
by the way.

1588
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:48,830
Yeah. And that includes in
America supplements, Jocko,

1589
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:50,900
Jocko supplements.

1590
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:56,370
You know the Jocko thing is just
to complete a lack of originality.

1591
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:01,700
That's what it is. Because when you think
about it from a broader perspective,

1592
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,820
and you know me well enough to be like,
the last thing I would do is like, oh,

1593
01:33:04,821 --> 01:33:06,530
I'm just going to call everything Jocko.

1594
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:13,400
It's like bizarro though.
When you started with the podcast,

1595
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:16,640
it started with Jocko podcast and that,
I've said this before,

1596
01:33:16,641 --> 01:33:20,960
but I was on Tim Ferriss's
podcast and he was, he said like,

1597
01:33:20,961 --> 01:33:23,460
are you hungry? And I was
like, Jocko hungry. Yeah.

1598
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:25,820
And for some reason that
just made me chuckle.

1599
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:30,980
And then when we were naming this
podcast, I was like, well, you're like,

1600
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:31,500
what are you gonna call him?

1601
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:36,440
Like Jocko podcasts as if it's the same
knee Andra fall things. And so then,

1602
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,330
then it was like, okay, we're
going to make tea. Well,

1603
01:33:38,331 --> 01:33:40,970
what do you call pomegranate white tea?
What are we going to call it?

1604
01:33:40,971 --> 01:33:45,080
Like the vedic solution. I mean, we
didn't get to call it. It's like, okay,

1605
01:33:45,081 --> 01:33:46,760
well this,
it's going to be the tea that I drink,

1606
01:33:46,761 --> 01:33:51,470
so we'll just called Jocko
white tea. Okay, cool. Well
then, hey, when I, when I,

1607
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:56,690
when I started saying, you know what,
I need to make some good supplements,

1608
01:33:56,870 --> 01:34:01,760
Pete and Brian in the game, like
I'm like, Hey, can you make this?

1609
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:05,150
And they're like, yeah. And I said, okay,
well then what are we going to call it?

1610
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:09,680
We'll just call it, you know, so I'll
go Jocko. Supercross and there you go.

1611
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,800
So that's how we ended up with the least
creative name of any products that have

1612
01:34:15,831 --> 01:34:17,870
existed.
I apologize to everyone

1613
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:19,980
actually. It seemed like,
well, early on anyway,

1614
01:34:19,981 --> 01:34:22,820
it seemed like it wasn't creative
because you're like, hey, this create,

1615
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:26,790
like if I create this super creative name,
like is that important?

1616
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:27,624
Really great now.
No,

1617
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:30,340
I'm too busy making it good.
Cool.

1618
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:35,270
We talked about in the last podcast that
sometimes I'm so into functionality,

1619
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:37,640
yeah. That I don't need, that I'm not in,

1620
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:42,470
in synchronicity with the rest of
the world. Sometimes. For instance,

1621
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,020
if you allowed me to design a house,

1622
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:50,450
no human being would live in the house
except for me and like three other seals

1623
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:52,300
that I know that'd be like, Oh
yeah, this house is perfect. Right?

1624
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:55,800
Everyone else to be like, Bro,
what is wrong with you? He said,

1625
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:58,910
you know you have keep
that same with vehicles.

1626
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:01,610
Like if I could design my own vehicle,
no one would want to drive. It bumped me.

1627
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:02,700
Maybe that's,

1628
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:07,430
that one may be a little bit broader
because you get people that'd be like year

1629
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:08,180
or so.

1630
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:13,180
I have to be careful because sometimes
I'm just so into function that it just

1631
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:15,830
doesn't make sense to anyone else but me.

1632
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:16,880
Yeah,

1633
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,150
but it does have its value big time when
it comes to these supplements because

1634
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:21,860
what joint warfare function,

1635
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:25,430
try lose function and your joint and see
what happens. Same thing with Krill oil.

1636
01:35:25,431 --> 01:35:29,600
Same thing with discipline, brain
function, and then of course milk.

1637
01:35:29,601 --> 01:35:33,500
That's muscle function and muscle
building function recovery,

1638
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:37,220
if you will still look all of them
together, brain function, joint function,

1639
01:35:37,221 --> 01:35:38,270
muscle function,

1640
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:44,420
boom. You're good to go. Yeah.
Yeah. And speaking of functionality,

1641
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:48,760
and this is one of the things
where you kind of attacked me, sir,

1642
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,540
you attacked me because for you,
you see this is,

1643
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:57,230
this is a perfect example in your
mind. I'm all about function. Right.

1644
01:35:57,590 --> 01:36:00,020
Then when I started making supplements,

1645
01:36:00,410 --> 01:36:03,440
I wanted them to taste
good and that was actually,

1646
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:09,140
it was actually side by side with
functionality is taste. Why is that?

1647
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,150
Because if you don't,
if it doesn't taste good,

1648
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:13,460
then it's not gonna function cause
you're not going to use it. Yeah.

1649
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:19,220
So these tastes delish yeah,
especially mark. Let's face the facts.

1650
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:22,560
There's a whole new thing. Yeah. It's,

1651
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:26,810
it's literally a new thing in the world.
We had to create, I create a name for it.

1652
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,440
Milk. Why did I create that name?
What else are you going to call?

1653
01:36:30,441 --> 01:36:33,260
It doesn't make sense to call it anything
else because there's not anything else.

1654
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,040
It just is more,
that's what it is now.

1655
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:43,070
Okay. I got four kids. We know I have
four kids. I spend time with kids.

1656
01:36:43,071 --> 01:36:45,500
I see kids all the time.
We got kids Jujitsu programs at my gym.

1657
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:50,420
What do kids need? Kids need fuel. What
do kids get fed? They get fed crap. Why?

1658
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:54,920
Because there's, there's
sugar in everything. There's
high fructose corn syrup,

1659
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,670
Corn Syrup and everything.
There's just garbage.

1660
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,290
So with my own kids,
what do I want to feed them?

1661
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:07,370
I want to feed them something that's
good. We made warrior kid milk. Why?

1662
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:11,900
Because kids need good food. Eat. We're,
we're putting kids on the warrior path.

1663
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:16,850
I get letters every single day from
kids all over the world. New Zealand,

1664
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:20,330
Australia, Europe, America, for sure.

1665
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:24,110
Kids that are seven years old that are
nine years old, that are 11 years old,

1666
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:27,950
that are 14 years old. And they're
on the path. They're doing pull ups,

1667
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:30,770
they're doing Jujitsu, they're sending
pictures of their Jujitsu tournament.

1668
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:34,340
They're drawing pictures of their metal
that they got for Jujitsu. You know,

1669
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:37,940
there's kids that are on the warrior
kid path. What are they eating?

1670
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:42,080
Are they eating junk? Sometimes they're
eating junk. Not because they want to,

1671
01:37:42,081 --> 01:37:44,330
but that's because what's,
that's what's in their fridge.

1672
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:47,180
So had to solve that problem.

1673
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:50,720
So we made warrior kid milk again.

1674
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:55,530
What was equivalent to functionality.
The function was they need protein,

1675
01:37:55,531 --> 01:37:56,190
they need vitamins,

1676
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,180
any probiotics,

1677
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:02,160
functional part side by side
with that had to taste good.

1678
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:06,930
Yeah. Had to taste good. And what
do we end up with? Warrior kid milk,

1679
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,070
chocolate and strawberry.

1680
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:14,400
It's freaking delicious.
Both of them.

1681
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:19,530
They're so good. They're so
tasty. It's ridiculous. So

1682
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:26,180
that's where your kid milk that's
available from origin main.com.

1683
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:29,430
We're going to try and get
that one out to the masses.

1684
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:34,880
Every kid needs or your kid walk instead
of drinking some sugar fold crap of

1685
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:40,010
fillers, we're going to give you real
food going to make you stronger or soda.

1686
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:43,890
Yeah man. I used to, uh, we never had
thought of growing up in my house,

1687
01:38:43,891 --> 01:38:46,470
but I used to go to my friend's
house name is Eric Masters.

1688
01:38:46,471 --> 01:38:49,830
He's a pilot from the air
force, by the way. Um,

1689
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:52,530
so I go to his house and they'd have, so
he didn't, he didn't, wasn't pounding.

1690
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:54,780
So it all the time is a
superior athlete. Oh, this guy.

1691
01:38:54,781 --> 01:38:58,260
But they had cylinder kind of above
the thing. Wait. So when I was a kid,

1692
01:38:58,261 --> 01:39:01,890
we didn't even relate. Like soda wasn't
bad for you. We just were like, oh,

1693
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:04,800
this is just, this is just how like,
oh, we just jumped clear. I'm thirsty.

1694
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:08,490
I'm going to drink a coke and mentos or
your Fridays to drink. Joke about that.

1695
01:39:08,491 --> 01:39:11,490
Like when you were a kid, like, oh,
I haven't drinken anything all day.

1696
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:14,850
I'm really thirsty. Give me a coke.
Yeah, you just drank it. Exactly right.

1697
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,720
And that's the, you didn't know that
there was 36 grams of corn syrup in there.

1698
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:24,390
It's a, yeah, good job. Thinking back,
I'm like, Dang, that is a crazy, crazy.

1699
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:28,320
What could you imagine?
And you only weighed 48 pounds.

1700
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:32,730
It wasn't like, it wasn't like you're
a 225 pound grown man. I'm like,

1701
01:39:32,731 --> 01:39:36,030
I am right now. I could probably put
down a coke and it wouldn't character,

1702
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,960
but you're,
you're nine years old here.

1703
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:44,860
Get some of that wrong. Some
grape crush pineapple. So many.

1704
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:48,730
I cut you off and do and, and Mr Masters
snow. Yeah, but no, that was that.

1705
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:51,900
That's the point where you're going,
it's just that, that's just how, Oh yeah,

1706
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:53,940
grab a soda after school,
whatever.

1707
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,550
They'd sell sodas for 50 cents after
our school. You go in the thing,

1708
01:39:56,551 --> 01:40:01,220
you buy the soda, whatever, Soda Machine,
whatever. What if it was Marketo? Oh,

1709
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:02,400
way better.
Way Better.

1710
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:05,740
Cause it tastes just as good if actually
it tastes better than soda because on

1711
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:10,590
for sure undeniable and your,
yeah, that'd be just be way better.

1712
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:15,750
So there you go.
Where your kids Moke Moke for the adults.

1713
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,570
And then the other funny thing was I
had all the people send in pictures of

1714
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:21,010
their kids drinking before
we had warrior kid mortgage.

1715
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,670
The kids were just straight up going
down the milk, train themselves.

1716
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,510
Little Kid's two years old,
three years old, four years old,

1717
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:28,830
little kids drinking milk.

1718
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:32,510
I would get the warrior kid mock
a little less protein. Yeah.

1719
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:37,560
Tasty as can be vitamins,
probiotics.

1720
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:42,420
Just good to go. Way to go.
100%. Yeah, totally good to go.

1721
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:45,150
We're going to change the world with
that one. Going to make it strong again.

1722
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:50,340
Also if you want to represent, we
got some shirts for you, go to Jocko,

1723
01:40:50,341 --> 01:40:54,250
store.com that's where you can
get this Lind equals freedom.

1724
01:40:55,100 --> 01:41:00,100
A shirt with Jockos head on it that
I made with the word good written.

1725
01:41:00,371 --> 01:41:03,580
You also get a shirt with echos
head on it that Jocko made,

1726
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:08,020
which have been now captured in
the wild. People representing. Yes.

1727
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:11,890
Then that made me feel really,
really good. Really? Oh,

1728
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:16,330
so you kind of got off on that. That was
like really cool. Like Oh, I got fans

1729
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:20,650
there.
Of course there's that.

1730
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:24,160
Put it this way for someone
to represent that hardcore,

1731
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:28,390
don't wear that shirt because it's a cool
design. I like it. And then you know,

1732
01:41:28,391 --> 01:41:29,500
for them that was a little,

1733
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:32,320
everyone seemed really handle compliment
my direction because I designed it.

1734
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:36,050
Yeah. Everyone seem real happy with
them saying the whole group, you know,

1735
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:41,210
there's some layers on that shirt. Yeah.
Massive multiple layers nonetheless.

1736
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:44,680
Some cool stuff on there. We've
got some hoodies on there. Yeah.

1737
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,670
If you want to represent,

1738
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:49,300
go to [inaudible] dot com some good
stuff on there for everybody, by the way.

1739
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:54,730
Yeah, and also subscribe to the
podcast, this podcast for sure.

1740
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:59,620
Itunes, wherever you get podcasts, you
know that also the warrior kid podcast.

1741
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:05,530
Take a listen to it all ages. Take a
listen to it. Definitely kids. Dave Burke,

1742
01:42:05,531 --> 01:42:10,200
he's saying he just got that the warrior
kid podcast on repeat. Yeah, guilty,

1743
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:14,950
but he's got the, he's got the warrior
kid podcast on repeat for his kids.

1744
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:19,900
I talked to so many people when we're at
roll call monster, they're like, yeah,

1745
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:23,860
we're, we're going. We just got
it. 24 seven kids in the car.

1746
01:42:23,861 --> 01:42:25,180
We listen to warrior kid podcasts.

1747
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:29,680
The lessons that you want to teach your
kid that your kid doesn't really want to

1748
01:42:29,681 --> 01:42:32,500
hear from you because you're their mom,
you're their dad.

1749
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:35,750
They don't want to hear it from you. They
want to hear it from Uncle Jake. Yeah.

1750
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,810
They want to hear it from Uncle Jake and
I would go so far as to say don't even

1751
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,390
one of the, you know, you
said you can't just say, oh,

1752
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:45,040
I'm going to take extreme
ownership of that. Yeah.

1753
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,500
What you can do with your
kids is turned round.

1754
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:50,530
When you're in the car and say you see
Uncle Jake saying the same thing I told

1755
01:42:50,531 --> 01:42:52,860
you. Yeah, you know, don't
do that. Don't get, don't,

1756
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:57,340
don't discredit uncle Jake and
you're not really discrediting him,

1757
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,230
but what you're doing is you're
bringing your, you're forming a team,

1758
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:05,440
right? You're forming a
team. It's us against you.

1759
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,700
And when Uncle Jake's talking to the kid,
they're on the same teeth and team.

1760
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:12,430
Uncle Jake is in the game with the kids,
the kids,

1761
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:15,460
you have a natural
friction with your parents.

1762
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:19,660
If you take uncle Jake side strongly,

1763
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,260
now you're on uncle channel.
It's you against your kids against,

1764
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:26,680
you don't want that. You should almost
play reverse psychology and be like, well,

1765
01:43:26,681 --> 01:43:29,890
you know, it's a little extreme for
uncle Jake to want to work out that much.

1766
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:35,020
And your kid be like, well, I think we
should probably listen to Uncle Jake Dad.

1767
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,770
Maybe. Maybe we should get
a pull up bar. By the way,

1768
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:42,580
get a pull up bar for your kids.
Just get a pull up bar form you.

1769
01:43:42,581 --> 01:43:45,130
It doesn't cost much.
It costs 12 bucks.

1770
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:50,160
You just need a piece of pipe and you
just hang it somewhere for your kids so

1771
01:43:50,501 --> 01:43:53,750
they can do pull, pull ups are important
for children. Yeah. Straight up.

1772
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:59,060
There's some fact about no kid that can
do a pull up is obese in the whole world.

1773
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:02,980
You can't be obese and do a pull
up as a kid thing. That's good.

1774
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:04,160
So let's do some pull ups.

1775
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:08,810
Dig It. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like a good
way to for the don't don't be like,

1776
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:10,450
I'm going to put this on in your

1777
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:13,330
listen. Oh yeah, don't do that. Yeah.

1778
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:18,640
You want the kids you want, it's like
when you go through military bootcamp,

1779
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:19,670
the drill,

1780
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:24,580
the drill instructors are real mean cause
they want you to form a gang against

1781
01:44:24,581 --> 01:44:28,810
them. That's part of the psychologies.
They want it to be us against them.

1782
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:32,350
So we form up into a platoon and we're
against this guy and then in the end it

1783
01:44:32,351 --> 01:44:34,920
all comes together.
Same thing we're going here.

1784
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:39,930
We you don't you want to let Uncle Jake
be part of their team and you just man

1785
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:47,730
of stuff. Uncle Jake says, man, he
seems like a pretty intense guy. Oh,

1786
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:51,190
and actually uncle Jake isn't that
intense on the warrior could podcast? No,

1787
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,620
he's telling stories about being a kid.
Yeah.

1788
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:56,140
He's answering questions
about being a kid.

1789

1790
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:01,530
he's more intense than the book

1791
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:05,670
for sure. He's more intense than the both
of the trash. Yeah. Waking Up. Yeah. Yeah,

01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:18,780
Aiden's up there making soap on his
farm so that you can stay clean.

1796
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:22,350
13 year old businessman getting after it.

Psychological warfare little album with
tracks to help you get through those

1803

suggestions or anything you need from

1805
01:45:56,161 --> 01:45:59,640
psychological warfare,
some moment of weakness that you have.

1806
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,360
We got a request for shopping an
impulsive shopper. When it put up,

1807
01:46:03,361 --> 01:46:05,400
we're going to put a
damper on that straight up.

We're going to shut that down. Yeah. So

very helpful. 100% success rate. Also,

1812
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:26,160
speaking of moments, a weakness, like
if you don't want to go to the gym,

1813
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,850
get stuff, Jim stuff, workout
equipment for your house.

1814
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:33,420
This is where you get them on [inaudible]
Dot com get kettle bells rings,

1815
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:38,580
battle ropes. You can get a uh,
a mason, a club. Do that Bro.

1816
01:46:38,581 --> 01:46:40,160
You get a good workout anyway.

1817
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:42,660
Makes it way easier to stay on
the path went cause let's face it,

1818
01:46:42,661 --> 01:46:44,370
driving to the gym is not that cool.

1819
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,720
And if you're feeling lazy or you're
time is pressuring like time constraints,

1820
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,310
but you stay home,
get a workout

1821
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:54,720
hard one too. That's where I get mine.
This Trump. Yeah, on it.com/jocko.

1822
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:55,860
That's a spot to go.

1823
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:00,750
100% also Jocko white tea.

1824
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:02,400
That's,

1825
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:07,030
it was like almost second was going to
have some mutek kicking like a white dude

1826
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:12,690
took them. Well there's the dichotomy
in that too. Sure. It tastes good.

1827
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:16,350
We know that it's tasting good as
part of the functionality I get in.

1828
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:21,680
But like white tea kind of sounds
kind of light and like Dane seem sane.

1829
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:27,810
And then you would read
black coffee. No, no, no.

1830
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:30,220
Black coffee. Get some
pump. I was telling life,

1831
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:33,390
I've never had a sip of
coffee in my whole life.

1832
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,850
I thought you said you
didn't like the taste. Okay.

1833
01:47:35,851 --> 01:47:37,510
Well I should have clarified that.
You don't like this.

1834
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:42,350
I didn't even like the smell
puts my lips were the alright.

1835
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:45,930
Hey Man, fair enough. I dig
it. Um, Jocko white tea.

1836
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:50,250
My wife's mom. A Brit.
Sure. Like my wife's a Brit.

1837
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:53,040
My wife's mom is even more British.
Right.

1838
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:56,620
Cause it was just an old toy that she
gets what she drinks. Cause you know,

1839
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,860
you know British people,
they don't even play around with tea.

1840
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:03,920
They don't even play around with t
deal part of the part of the life.

1841
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:09,290
Guess what kind of tissue drinks
Jokowi's yeah, so obviously she did that.

1842
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:14,350
We're sending shipments of Jocko white
tea to England. So she believes it. The,

1843
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:18,120
the, the, the damn world.
Global home of tea.

1844
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:22,260
Yeah there were having to ship it because
you bought your thing was always the

1845
01:48:22,261 --> 01:48:24,630
cold, the ice tea? No half the warranty.

1846
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:29,220
So you oh you mean as far as like
before you made Jocko white tea you,

1847
01:48:29,221 --> 01:48:32,340
I'd always see you drinking the
cold one most. Most of the time.

1848
01:48:32,341 --> 01:48:36,300
Most of the time I prefer cold cause
most of the time I'm in a situation where

1849
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,610
I'm hot and I need to cool down.

1850
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:42,630
Sometimes I'm in a situation where I'm
cool and I need to warm up and when he

1851
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:45,270
wants to sell them,
when you cold you want to be cozy.

1852
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:53,850
But I mean I'm saying Brits, they don't
dig the cold Ice Tea. That's why. Well,

1853
01:48:53,851 --> 01:48:55,980
you know what's nice is like
before you have to talk a lot.

1854
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:59,670
I'm sure you can drink
white tea for the throat,

1855
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:04,620
relax the throat and yet at the same
time you're getting a little caffeine hit

1856
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:08,250
her
getting a little caffeine.

1857
01:49:08,251 --> 01:49:12,660
He hit her with some antioxidants and
not to mention if there's any vehicles

1858
01:49:12,661 --> 01:49:13,620
where you need to pick up,

1859
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:17,430
you got an 8,000 pound dead lift so you're
good to go guarantee whatever we need.

1860
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,310
Yeah it's good. I stopped the
Yoav on the other day and he was,

1861
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:24,120
he posted something on Instagram.
He had a chick filet hitter.

1862
01:49:26,970 --> 01:49:31,070
So those of you that are wondering about
my head or reference. Yes. Theo von.

1863
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:31,913
Thank you.

1864
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:36,750
You have brought that word
into my vocabulary and I
had a little Jocko white tea

1865
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:37,260
hit her.

1866
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:42,260
I also have been using the term to
describe one scoop of Moloch and we just,

1867
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:45,180
that's just a one.
It just a one scoop hitter.

1868
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:48,460
Good cause cause two scoops legitimately

1869
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:51,700
fills you up. You don't want to eat
a meal. Yeah. No you don't want it.

1870
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:54,550
You ate like a little decent meal
but you still want something,

1871
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:58,990
a dessert to two scoops in.
You're just, that's too much.

1872
01:49:58,991 --> 01:50:03,130
Too much. You have that little one scoop
hitter, easy money and you're good to go.

1873
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:04,083
Good to go.

1874
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:09,490
And if you tried the strawberry strawberry
kids more cause ridiculously tasty.

1875
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:12,250
You're on to something on that check

1876
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:17,110
and some books.
Got Some books.

1877
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:20,230
I got quite a few books
actually weigh the warrior kid.

1878
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:22,750
Mark's mission already talked
about that a little bit.

1879
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:27,250
You want your kids on the path to
him. Pullups studying, memorizing,

1880
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:31,360
getting smarter, getting
better. This is not,

1881
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:36,730
this is not, hey, I think this will
happen. This is at this point. Same thing.

1882
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:40,420
I know this will happen.
I know this will happen.

1883
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:44,410
Your kids will want a pull up bar.
Your kids will want to do Jujitsu.

1884
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:46,960
Your kids will want to study for school,
study for school.

1885
01:50:46,961 --> 01:50:50,680
What kid wants to study for school?
Wore your kids warrior kid.

1886
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,600
The first book is called
way of the warrior kid.

1887
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:57,460
The second book is called March
mission. Learn about life. Next book,

1888
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:02,530
discipline equals freedom field manual.
I forgot to say this recently.

1889
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:06,970
If you want the audio version of that,
it's on Itunes,

1890
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,490
mp3s, whatever, Amazon play,
Google music, whatever. It's,

1891
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:15,520
it's on all those. Yep, and that will,
that's where you get the audio version.

1892
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:19,270
I recommend the book is not normal.
It's not a normal book.

1893
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:25,480
So get that book. Read a page a
day. Read a page a day for a year.

1894
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:30,550
See what that does to your life.
I'll get, make an assessment.

1895
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:35,770
You live, your life will get better.
Is that a bold statement? Maybe,

1896
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,790
but let me tell you. Give
it a try. Give it a try.

1897
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:44,770
Extreme ownership.
Interestingly,

1898
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:49,840
extreme ownership number five on the
Wall Street Journal Bestseller list.

1899
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:52,300
It just wasn't a number one
New York Times best seller.

1900
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:57,550
That list rotates or whatever.
Wall Street Journal number five on that.

1901
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:01,540
Number 13 on Amazon.
Most read books of all books on Amazon.

There's millions of books
on there in the world.

1903
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:10,770
It's number 13 we got so extreme
ownership leadership book experiences from

combat applied to your
business and your life today.

1905
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:19,120

looms, we can weave material,

1914
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:07,370
we can print some books and
that's what we're doing.

1915
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:11,720

Thanks for making this podcast and our
way of life possible by keeping us safe

1948

When you face those hardships
and challenges that are
coming your way and they

Don't ask yourself,
why me?

1952
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:02,690
Ask yourself what am I
going to do about it?

1953
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:07,710
And then
go get after it.

1954
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:14,910
