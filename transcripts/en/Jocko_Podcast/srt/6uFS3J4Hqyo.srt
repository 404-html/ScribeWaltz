1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,650
This is Jocko podcast number
27 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,270
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,013
Okay.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,660
I knew a simple soldier boy

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,890
who grinned at life in empty joy,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,380
slept soundly through the loan,

7
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:27,630
some dark and whistled early with the lark

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,960
in winter trenches, cowed pen, glom

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,510
with Krumpes and lice and lack of rum.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
He put a bullet through his brain.

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,600
No one spoke of him again.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,950
You smug faced crowd to with kindling.

13
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:58,951
I who cheer when soldier Lads March by
sneak home and pray you'll never know the

14
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:06,340
hell where youth and laughter go.

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,550
That's a poem

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,230
called suicide in the trenches.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,290
Bye Siegfried Sasoon.

18
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,740
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,980
Siegfried Sasoon was decorated for
extreme bravery in world war one on the

20
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:41,520
western front.

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,880
He was nicknamed Mad Jack for his nearly
suicidal exploits against the enemy.

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,940
His brother

23
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,120
was killed in action
in the glibly campaign.

24
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,950
He was eventually sent to a hospital

25
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,110
to try and recover mentally from what
he'd been through while he was there.

26
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,170
He wrote a little letter that was called
finished with the war plus soldiers

27
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,860
declaration
where

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,980
he came out and said,
we got to stop fighting the war like this.

29
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,900
I'm speaking for the men that are on
the front lines in the trenches being

30
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:43,910
killed,
and even after that

31
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,420
he was promoted.

32
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,460
He returned to the front again.

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,970
He was a wounded this
time by friendly fire.

34
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,800
That's World War One.

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,493
Yeah,

36
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,510
and while Siegfried
Sassoon tells us to pray,

37
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:17,100
we will never know the hell
where youth and laughter go.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,633
Yeah,

39
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,430
I do not agree with that.

40
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,240
I want to know when I want everyone
to know and understand and to see

41
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,360
the hell,
the darkness

42
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,160
that crushes youth and laughter.

43
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,980
Then taking us on this voyage into dark
tonight is a man by the name of Bob

44
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,660
Hoffman that if you look him up,

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,410
you'll see he's a very accomplished man.

46
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,630
He was obsessed with health and
fitness and he became a businessman.

47
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,090
He was the one of the founders
of the York Bar Corporation.

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,980
If you ever lifted weights in your life,
you've used York barbells at some time.

49
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,960
Nope. He's often called the
father of modern weightlifting,

50
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,800
but interestingly,

51
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,250
what you won't find much about
him is his military service.

52
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,660
You don't see generally that he was
awarded the Distinguished Service Cross,

53
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,830
the Silver Star, the purple
heart, the French cross of war,

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,580
the French military metal,
the Italian war cross,

55
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,320
and the highest Belgian military award.
The order of Leopold.

56
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,073
Okay.

57
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,840
You just don't hear that about him,

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,470
but that was a piece of his life.

59
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,413
Okay.

60
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,440
He did write about it.
You wrote about it in a book,

61
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,790
which is called,
I remembered the last war

62
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,790
and let's go to the book.

63
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,310
Few

64
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,470
people have been able to learn much about
what actually took place in the front

65
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:17,550
line,
fighting of the world war.

66
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,510
They have often asked about the war and
it found few veterans who could talk

67
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,344
about it.

68
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,500
One of the chief reasons for this is
that they had little or nothing to tell

69
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:30,620
about the war.

70
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,030
Approximately 4 million men
were in service during the war.

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,740
Half of these went to France and of these
half a million, we're near the front.

72
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,210
10 men are required behind the
front to keep one man in action.

73
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,570
Service supply truck drivers,
hospital workers, ambulance drivers,

74
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:53,840
guards in the bass ports,
the replacement and casualty camps.

75
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,550
Many thousands of military
police, artillery, signalman

76
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,190
aviators, mechanics, and endless more.

77
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,000
Our division lost more men than any
other former national guard division.

78
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,840
More Monday,

79
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,710
more men than any other organization
except the first and second regular

80
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,544
divisions.

81
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,350
Our regiment lost more men than any
other regimen over our division.

82
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,221
Our battalion,

83
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:22,450
more men of any of the three battalions
in our regiment and our company.

84
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:26,450
More men than any other
company in the battalion. Yeah,

85
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,870
we had men who never saw a
German who was not a prisoner.

86
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,310
Some of our men were cooks, top sergeants,
company clerk supplies sergeants,

87
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,510
buglers, signalman kitchen police.
The men who carried up the ammunition,

88
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:43,530
the rations, cared for the wounded
and advanced stations buried the dead.

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,370
Many one liaison men carrying
messages from company to battalion.

90
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,590
They fired and were fired at as we
fought in towns, woods and hills,

91
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:58,591
but seldom saw targets at which they
fired bombs and shells were dropped on

92
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:03,930
them. They suffered from gas
and most of the horrors of war,

93
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,280
they were killed,
but they weren't actually at the front.

94
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,440
Okay.

95
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,250
Men who were trained as I was scouting,
patrolling observation,

96
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:19,920
sniping who led patrols,
reconnaissance or combat advanced guards,

97
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,030
captured prisoners, put a gun out
of action, held advanced posts,

98
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,980
served as suicide squads,

99
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:30,960
and we were being attacked were the men
who actually saw war and most of them

100
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:31,794
are dead

101
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,340
while 125,000 American dead and France
are not so many when divided among the

102
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:42,310
million men who were at or near the front.

103
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,600
It is a tremendous percentage when it
is considered how few of these men were

104
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:47,500
doing the fighting.

105
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,960
Okay.

106
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,160
More than 250 men in our
company alone or killed.

107
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,220
Okay.

108
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,490
More than the original strength of the
company lost their lives in France.

109
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,770
They can't tell you the story.

110
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,910
I was phenomenally lucky,
so I will tell our story.

111
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,790
We'll try to tell you something
of what happened over there.

112
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,720
There have been more books written by
other men who were better writers than I

113
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,260
more fitted to place what they
saw upon the printed page.

114
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,280
Okay.

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,000
But I don't believe a book about America's
participation in the war has been

116
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,850
written by a man who spent days,
weeks,

117
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,970
and months in intensive fighting at or
in front of the front as my comrades and

118
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:34,684
I did.

119
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,780
There is nothing particularly glorious
or beautiful about this story.

120
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,270
I've told it as well as I could,

121
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,500
but have been able to give you only
a faint idea of the conditions we

122
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:54,501
encountered during the five worst days
of any unit of the American arm army

123
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:56,430
experience in France.

124
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,760
The five days of our battle of fizz met.

125
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,070
Okay.

126
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,210
You could fully appreciate its
horrors only if you were there

127
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,800
never was a group of men harder pressed
by superior forces of the enemy or more

128
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,720
ill equipped to fight off those attacks.
Then we

129
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,780
no artillery support during most
of the fighting, no trench mortars,

130
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,130
no hand or rifled grenades.
Just a moderate amount of pistol,

131
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,180
rifle and machine gun ammunition,
no food,

132
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,990
proper medical attention
or the opportunity to bury
the dead are men in that

133
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:38,200
battle,

134
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,200
the handful who held the front lines
covered themselves with undying glory.

135
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,190
The telling of this story will give a
better idea of what we did in France and

136
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,860
other books than other
war books I've seen.

137
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,620
It tells the unvarnished truth
about how we lived, slept,

138
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
hiked, fought, and died over their

139
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,900
scores of my friends.
The men I had lived with,

140
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,160
trained with, fought with,
had come to liken, admire,

141
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,680
died in the woods in France.

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,800
It was only by a series of miracles.

143
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,980
Amazing escapes that I did not die
to that I am here writing this book,

144
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,700
okay?

145
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,700
I was young then 19 years of age at
the time of the battle of the are gone.

146
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,620
Okay.

147
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,300
I had been too busy to live and because
I had not found what a fine place the

148
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:43,290
world can be,
I did not mind particularly dying.

149
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,800
I had no actual fear of death.

150
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,570
Okay.

151
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,840
21 years ago when we fought
the battle of the Argonne,

152
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,140
I had 32 ugly Boyle blood boils on my
body from eating a diet consisting mostly

153
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:02,200
of meat and bread for some weeks boils,

154
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:06,010
which made me swear more than I
have all the rest of my life has.

155
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:11,011
I constantly scraped them on the rocky
ground while digging a new hole to

156
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:13,480
protect my body.
Each time we halted.

157
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,140
Yeah,

158
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,160
I had French itch and copious
quantities of mustard gas,

159
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,710
ugly burns,
which still leave their scars.

160
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,210
12 bullets left their mark on my person
or my equipment in the first short

161
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,384
battle.

162
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,410
Okay?

163
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,410
I was one of 32 men of our 250 strength
company who marched out of the battle of

164
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:38,854
Fizz.
May.

165
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,080
I was the only man to return of those who
followed me on five patrols that I led

166
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,450
in one day in the Argonne forest.

167
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,093
Okay.

168
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,100
I hope through this book
at least partially to show

169
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,240
the gruesome side of war,
barred from the waiving of flags,

170
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,100
the bugles bands,

171
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,160
the cheering to show at
least part of the ugliness,

172
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,920
filth, dirt, evil,

173
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,890
a morality and stink of war.

174
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,903
Okay.

175
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,580
Be sympathetic but remain aloof.
Be Strong,

176
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:23,480
prepared to protect our own
country against any nation
or combination of nations

177
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:27,650
which may attack our homes, our
democracy, our American way of living.

178
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,050
Okay.

179
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,520
If our country was attacked,

180
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:35,230
the first hour would not pass before
I would plan to enlist and millions of

181
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:39,850
other Americans would be in just as much
haste to protect our wonderful country

182
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,910
and our American way of life.
So that's

183
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,723
okay.

184
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,840
How he kicks this book off,
kind of burning through the intro there,

185
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,250
and I really liked the point that he
made when he broke down the numbers that

186
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:01,860
how many people go to war,

187
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,180
but how many people are actually
fighting and it's a big discrepancy.

188
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,650
There's a, it takes a lot of people to
get bullets to the guy on the front line,

189
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,040
right?

190
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,730
It takes a lot of people to get that
person transport it to the front lines.

191
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,430
It takes a lot of people to
get to keep that person fed.

192
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,970
It takes all kinds of
logistics and support just to
just to get that guy through

193
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:25,650
the door of a building where the enemy is,

194
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,920
and I've talked about this before too,
in Iraq, there was places in Iraq where

195
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,920
there was basis in Iraq where it
was basically like being in America.

196
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:42,921
They had restaurants and Starbucks
coffee and Mcdonald's and Burger King and

197
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,380
they had pools and movie theaters.
I mean it was crazy.

198
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,340
Is it where like you mentioned like
Burger King for example, do they,

199
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,920
does burger king the company
kind of make a deal with,

200
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:59,490
you know the government and be like,
hey, we want to supply Burger King? Yes,

201
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,140
I'm sure it actually,
I shouldn't have said Mcdonald's.

202
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,970
He was usually a burger king.
They must have,

203
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:04,800
will be the ones that
had the deal at the time.

204
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,130
So Burger King was there
on base and you would,

205
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,710
we would travel though to outstations
where there's some army unit.

206
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:14,690
This is on my first appointment,

207
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,640
traveled to some outstation where there's
some army unit live now in the middle

208
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:20,280
of nowhere,
just totally desolate.

209
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,110
Some Marine Corps unit live in in the
middle of the nowhere eaten Mrs Everyday.

210
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,280
And like there was a group
we were working with, one,

211
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,850
I wish I could remember where
they were to give him some credit,

212
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,370
but they were out there.
They were on one Mre a day,

213
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,480
which Mras and meals ready to
eat. It's a, it's a not a very,

214
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,180
not a very good way to live off of.

215
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,010
And these guys were out there living off
of one MRE a day and age. You feel bad,

216
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,440
you know, you go out. We stopped that.
We, I think we had to stop at their base.

217
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:48,480
We had to get some information,
gather some Intel,

218
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:51,410
they knew some targets around the area.
We went and talked to him,

219
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,620
saw how rough they were living and we
went out and hit our targets that we were

220
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:56,180
driving back to our big bass,
you know,

221
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:01,130
where we had good food and you know,
Internet,

222
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,690
stuff like that. I mean it's, it's,
it's amazing how good it can be.

223
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,120
And that's what,
that's what people,

224
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,650
some people don't realize about the
military as it takes a lot of support and

225
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:16,130
logistics to keep the guys on the front
lines on the front lines and not taking

226
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:19,100
anything away from those folks that are
doing that. Because that's a hard job.

227
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,450
And I've talked about this before,

228
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,540
those logistics convoys
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

229
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,520
those things were hardcore and horrible,
dangerous jobs to do.

230
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,470
And so I'm not taking anything
away, but if you want to say, okay,

231
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:37,730
who went out and hunted
down the enemy and got them?

232
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,830
It's a much, much smaller group of
people, right? So it's like individually,

233
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,990
yeah,
you got people who did that part of it,

234
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:49,220
but collectively it's just this
huge force, right, of people. Yeah,

235
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:51,170
it's a massive,
it's a massive force,

236
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:56,171
but it's even more extreme
because in world war one,

237
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,170
the lines were very clearly drawn.
I mean,

238
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:02,990
you had literally had
trenches in the ground.

239
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,280
And so if you weren't within range of the,
of the enemy attacks,

240
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:09,080
I mean maybe that gets some planes to you,
but you would,

241
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,300
you'd be living relatively safe.
And that's his point.

242
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,550
And then when you get a little
closer to the front lines, yeah,

243
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:15,710
you were going to get some
artillery bombardment,

244
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,320
but everyone had dug these
nice holes in these trenches.

245
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:23,321
So the guys that were actually
invading German trenches,

246
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,700
most of them are dead. Most of them are
dead. It's a small, it's a much, it's one,

247
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,530
it's one out of every 10 soldiers that
was actually going forward to attack.

248
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,250
And most of them are dead. I mean,
you could hear what he just said.

249
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,970
They took more casualties than the
strength of their, of their company was.

250
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,040
So they had 250 guys.

251
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,770
There was actually a thousand guys in
the company because they took so many

252
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,604
casualties.

253
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,410
That's why World War one is so horribly
disturbing and scary to me because like

254
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:59,030
I've said before, there wasn't a tactics.
You're your own tactical prowess.

255
00:16:59,031 --> 00:16:59,930
One going to help you.

256
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,770
You're your own personal skillset
wasn't really going to help you.

257
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,230
Yeah. You were going to get up, you're
going to charge an and really, uh,

258
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,450
Bob Hoffman talks about
this and he was just lucky.

259
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,560
He was a great athlete and he trained
hard and he was constantly trying to make

260
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:20,510
himself better. I'm sure that contributed
to it all somewhat. But Hey, when you,

261
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,470
when he comes off the battlefield and
he'd been shot 13 times a one, you know,

262
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,060
in the knees, his bullet holes in his
canteens, he'd been just, it just,

263
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,160
that's just miracle. Look, don't.

264
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,060
So going back to the book,
he says,

265
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,180
we should bend all our efforts toward
becoming so strong that no other nation or

266
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,800
coalition of nations
will dare to attack us.

267
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,410
We should build the physical strength of
our manhood and womanhood or mechanical

268
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:55,710
equipment,

269
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,710
our navy in particular and our army so
that we can resist any form of invasion

270
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,670
in the future.
And I,

271
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,590
I put that in there because you're going
to see a pretty common theme in the way

272
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:12,760
this guy lived his life, which was to
be stronger, faster, better, smarter,

273
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,560
always trying to improve himself,

274
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,280
always trying to be the best
Bob Hoffman that he could be.

275
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:21,070
And obviously that's how we ended
up running a giant, you know,

276
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:24,040
Organization for weightlifting and fitness

277
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,430
and he actually took some heat for the
way he lived sometimes and here they were.

278
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,460
They were on the,
on the ship heading overseas,

279
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,800
heading to France or to England.

280
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,580
And he's talking about what it was like
for him being a guy that believes in

281
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,870
being strong and healthy and smarter
and trying to improve himself.

282
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,150
Here, here we go. Back to the book,
all sorts of men make up an army,

283
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,700
good,
bad and indifferent.

284
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,850
I found myself in lots of trouble.

285
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,230
I had been fond of study
athletics and work. Went home.

286
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,820
I didn't smoke,

287
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,030
drink to gamble or go out
with questionable women or
indulge in other diversions

288
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,730
that some considered to be manly.

289
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,070
Yeah,

290
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,910
there were men who thought that I was
a sissy because I did not have manly

291
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:18,780
habits.

292
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,100
This led to a great many fights
and I fought at one time.

293
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,330
I would have to beat every man in the
company individually to prove that I

294
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:28,350
wasn't a sissy.

295
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,200
I did get enough practice that later
enabled me to win the boxing championship

296
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,420
in my body weight class of our division.

297
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,760
This experience serve me well on the
Atlantic crossing for, I fought five,

298
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:43,890
three round fights in one day.

299
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,000
Someone had to do it
and the job fell on me.

300
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,530
So he was getting, you know,
for lack of a better word,

301
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:59,531
picked on because he was a goody two shoes
and the only way he was able to stand

302
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,910
up for himself,
which just to get his scrap on,

303
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,490
get his fight on the street
edge. Yeah. He was, uh,

304
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,410
he was an early day straight edge guy.

305
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,180
Yeah.
I don't think he had a,

306
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,910
the straight edge music going into his
head yet that might have helped them out.

307
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,110
So they get overseas and now
I'm taking you straight into it,

308
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,910
into them getting him, getting tasked
with, with their first mission.

309
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,110
Okay,

310
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,943
and here we go.

311
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Was I thrilled the front at last when
asked by our captain if I wanted to go

312
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:39,600
with the platoon, I said, do I want to go?

313
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,960
That's what I've been a yearning
and aching for all these months.

314
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,070
When I was just a youngster, I would
read books telling how anxious soldiers

315
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,270
were to go into action.

316
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,490
I couldn't understand how men could
desire to go out and fight and die,

317
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,880
but it is something that grows on you.

318
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,810
You train and expect so long that finally
you become anxious to get into it,

319
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,780
to get it over with.
Time was short.

320
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,630
We went back to our companies on the run.

321
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,480
Our company was assembled and I briefly
explained that a platoon of 58 man was

322
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:21,190
to be selected and that we were to make
an attack with the French at six o'clock

323
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:24,640
that night.
My words felt like a bombshell,

324
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,770
a brief cheer went up from our company.

325
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,480
I asked all the men who wanted to
be first in action to step forward.

326
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,310
And like one man,
the entire company stepped forward.

327
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,100
Mandy did. Men who did not get to
go on this trip cried real tears,

328
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,210
a direct contrast to the lack of
volunteering for dangerous missions.

329
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:49,300
A few months later when
they had become war weary,

330
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,550
then they would go if assigned to
any task, no matter how dangerous,

331
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,740
but they did not rush in.
They became fatalists and said they'd go,

332
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:03,490
if they were chosen, they
die. If it was their turn,

333
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,240
but they weren't going to overwork fate.

334
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,723
Okay.

335
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,650
And if you,
that's perfect.

336
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:19,651
A comparison to the story that I tell in
my retirement speech where we had this

337
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,670
horrible situation going on in eastern
Ramadi and I basically said, all right,

338
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,460
whoever wants to go and
live in this worst area,

339
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,430
put your name up on that board in every
gap with their name up on that board.

340
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,691
And I'll tell you,

341
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:35,890
this is also accurate in the fact that
you fast forward two or three months into

342
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:39,490
deployment after we'd taken
casualties after mark had been killed.

343
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,130
And all of a sudden, guys, we're not,

344
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,100
and I'll use the exact quote he uses here.

345
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,130
They'd go to any task assigned
no matter how dangerous,

346
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,910
but they did not rush in.

347
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,260
They became war weary and
that happens to anybody.

348
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,380
Then I even saw that on my
first deployment to Iraq, we,

349
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,770
when we first got up into Baghdad,
everybody wants to go on every mission.

350
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,060
Everyone's all fired up,
but as time goes by,

351
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,750
you start saying, what are we doing this
mission for? What's this mission about?

352
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,820
Who? Who were you going after?
Fear starts to creep in.

353
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,790
Now let's get to the assault.

354
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,950
The French men were working like
mad with their trench mortars.

355
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,390
They kept shells continuously in the air.
At three minutes to six,

356
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,160
sergeant Felix walked along the pair of
Pitt informing all our men that we were

357
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,850
going over in a few moments.
I urged him to keep down,

358
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,540
not to make a target of himself,
but he disregarded my advice.

359
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,300
Finally,
as our watches,

360
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,960
which had been synchronized before
the pointed exactly to six o'clock,

361
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,340
there were whistles and commands
and climbing men leaving the trench.

362
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,600
All along the line,

363
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,770
the gunners who had been
working so desperately with
the trench mortars to pave

364
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,590
the way for us,
cheered and cried out to us,

365
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,440
evidently urging us to sweep
the Germans from the hill.

366
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,990
I just couldn't understand what they said.

367
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,440
Okay,

368
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,790
and soon we were in the thick of things,
bullets flying merrily.

369
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:16,140
By this time from the German trenches,
perhaps a fourth of a mile away,

370
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,980
I was hardly out of the trench
until some great force pushed me,

371
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,640
knocking me over for a
distance of perhaps 20 feet.

372
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,050
I didn't know what had hit me, but I
felt blood running down my right eye.

373
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,380
After that knocked down,

374
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,570
I forgot the line of combat groups
and we fought just as our ancestors.

375
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,950
Ancestors had always fought instinctive,
rushing forward,

376
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,100
stopping to shoot,
rushing again and shooting again.

377
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,630
Okay,

378
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,790
so that's like that's you're welcome
to combat. Oh, you're all fired up.

379
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,150
You ready to go get some cool.
Go over the top.

380
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,210
The first thing that happens to use, you
get shot, which is what happened to him.

381
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,590
He didn't even know it yet.

382
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,970
All Americans have a legacy which has
come to them from courageous fighting

383
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,170
pioneer ancestors.
The American soldier is a good soldier.

384
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,760
He has not had the centuries of
drilling to make his own individual self

385
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:17,750
subservient to the will
of the commanding officer.

386
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,880
He does not like to salute the brass
bar unless that lieutenant has a one,

387
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:27,050
has respect through deeds.
He does not like to be regimented,

388
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,640
turned into a mere robot.
He can think and act for himself,

389
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,450
and when a battle has
passed the initial stages,

390
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,700
he's the best soldier in the world.

391
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,150
This is going, it's again,
reminder, this is world war one,

392
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,570
and I say this all the time.

393
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,010
People in the military are not robots,

394
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,000
and I can't speak too much about
people from other militaries,

395
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:01,210
but clearly this was a standout fought
as an American looking at American troops

396
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,240
in combat. They, they're not just robots,

397
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,480
and one of the best things about
him is that they can think,

398
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,613
okay,

399
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,850
now here come a bunch of Americans
over on some Germans coming up on their

400
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:19,254
trench.

401
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,150
Perhaps the Germans were two startled at
the size and evident ferocity of their

402
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,310
antagonists to fight well for a minute,

403
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,760
but it seemed like a
group of big men who had,

404
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,240
who had met a lot of
boys playing soldiers.

405
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:38,610
One push and the Germans rifle was
knocked from his hand along frost,

406
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,520
and that unfortunate man had
reached the end of his life.

407
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,810
I can still see faces of these
men. They're evident. Terror.

408
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,760
Their astonishment at the number of men
who leaped at them from the grass at the

409
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:54,630
size and power of these men,
they're evident helplessness.

410
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,660
There was not time for them to surrender.

411
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,090
Okay?

412
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,780
They had jumped up with bayoneted
rifles in a moment or two,

413
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,490
it was all over.

414
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,320
Okay.

415
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,830
Now this continues.
Our advanced troops had passed me by,

416
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,540
I could see dead Germans laying here
and there right near me were two of them

417
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:18,830
close together. One of them was a big
older man with a Prussian mustache.

418
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,870
His hands still class for the point
in his stomach with a bayonet,

419
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,820
had gone in and been withdrawn.

420
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,550
The youngster lay all twisted up.

421
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,140
He too had been bayoneted and it seemed
that his bones were broken from the

422
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,820
strokes of the butt of a rifle.

423
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:41,000
A rifle is a wicked weapon when swung
by a powerful man and there were many

424
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:43,010
strong men in action that day.

425
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,200
It's, you know, you hear
about bayonet fighting,

426
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,220
okay.

427
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,790
But to think about it on
this scale where this is,

428
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,480
this is looking more like a scene out
of Braveheart at this point than it is

429
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,680
looking like a modern war.

430
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,160
People clubbing each other to death and
stabbing each other bay in that range.

431
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,660
The Germans weren't giving out,
giving up without a real struggle.

432
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,800
We had let her read a lot
about chained machine gunners,

433
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,390
but these men weren't chained and they
were fighting to the bitter bitter death.

434
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,410
Now that chain machine gunner,
this is like a rumor that happened.

435
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:31,430
The deep American's would here because
the Germans had a machine gun and it was

436
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:36,431
a big heavy sort of a medium weight or
heavyweight machine gun I think is a mg

437
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,620
Oh eight and and it was so heavy that
they put this big sling on it and on the

438
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:44,480
sling it was a made of leather,

439
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:48,920
but they had to reinforce the leather
with chain and so when they find these

440
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:53,921
soldiers dead with these machine guns
and the the chain would clip into their

441
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,820
gear. The rumor was that these guys had
just been chained to their machine goes,

442
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,840
you can't leave. You're just going to
stay here and fight to the death. Yeah.

443
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,993
Okay.

444
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,430
Our men were coming back
to the book are men.

445
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:11,180
We're constantly rising and falling.
Some of them never to rise again.

446
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,860
Our ranks were becoming rapidly decimated
and there were few of us still going

447
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:17,000
forward at this point.

448
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,580
I have never seen an authentic list of
the casualties of a company that day,

449
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,190
but I know this.

450
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:30,550
I never saw a single one of those 58
men of our company who went over the top

451
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:33,230
that night.
Again at the front.

452
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,130
I had been hit several
times once on the left knee.

453
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,250
Once on the right knee, either bullet
could have left me crippled for life,

454
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:49,990
but both glanced off the bone leaving
only a scar which is noticeable to this

455
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,823
day.

456
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,790
One grazed my arm leaving a scar at
present an inch long and three quarters of

457
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:55,624
an inch wide.

458
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,420
I had a variety of feelings as these
bullets struck or scratched me.

459
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,850
The first which hit my helmet gave me
the same sensation as if I had been

460
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:10,330
pushing as if I had been
pushed by a gigantic hand.

461
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,790
The bullets on the knees stung luck.

462
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:17,260
I had been hit with a whip and the bullet
that cut through the arm and the one

463
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:21,070
which left its mark on my face
felt like a drop of hot water.

464
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:25,690
It hit me about this time the
battle would become very hot.

465
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,510
We fired at every enemy we could see.

466
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,160
And they were firing from every
direction from the front left and right.

467
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,720
And even from behind because we'd gone
so fast that we had not dropped the

468
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,570
snipers who were firing
at us from the trees

469
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,030
caught in the little
360 degree field of fire

470
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,720
by the way, caught in a 360 degree
field of fire after you've been shot.

471
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:55,860
What,
five times.

472
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,813
Okay.

473
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,980
We talked about lucky obviously better
to be lucky than good at this point.

474
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,900
It's crazy how he w w how he
described getting shot. You know how

475
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,790
you'd almost think that Dang you get shot.
That'd be so painful.

476
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,900
But when you're in the heat of things,

477
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:20,901
and I think it happens so fast that it
like your nerves don't pick up on the,

478
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:24,900
the, the destruction. It depends
where you get shot. Yeah.

479
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,010
It depends on where those rounds hit.

480
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:30,670
And I remember actually even here in
guys from Vietnam, guys from seals,

481
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:35,550
from Vietnam told me, um, one guy told me
a story that the first time he got shot,

482
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,130
they were out on an operation,
came back.

483
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,500
He was literally heading out to the bikes.
Are you actually,

484
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,580
you said he was in the bar and he realized
he was bleeding and you look down and

485
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:47,790
he'd been shot somewhere in the abdomen.
But you know,

486
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:52,380
obviously it wasn't that bad,
but he had been shot. Um, yeah.

487
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,040
And it, it can, it, you can,

488
00:31:56,041 --> 00:32:00,600
you can catch a bullet in the wrong place
and it's game over or you can catch a

489
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:02,820
boat in the wrong place and you can just
take you off your feet or you can catch

490
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,980
a ball in the wrong place and
your arm won't move anymore.

491
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,240
Or they'll be massive amounts of pain
or you can catch a bullet in the right

492
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:12,810
place and it goes through and through.

493
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:16,740
It goes in and out very quickly, doesn't
hit anything vital. And you know,

494
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:21,270
you're just kind of lucky
as far as the pain goes.

495
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,270
You think, you know it's the
same thing. You're right.

496
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:28,260
Sometimes it goes through and through
and guys barely even notice it. Right.

497
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,440
And sometimes if it hits the wrong spot,
it hits a bone or whatever. I mean it's,

498
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,210
it's like a ricochet massive pain.
Like I hear stories about, um,

499
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,070
it's,
it's going to sound

500
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,701
kind of good tests,

501
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:44,900
but like grills will get stabbed in the
back or something and there'll be like,

502
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,130
oh,
it felt like,

503
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,150
I'm thinking of a particular story I heard
where girl got stabbed by an attacker

504
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,810
in the back and she was like, Oh, I,

505
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,460
it felt like he was just eating
me with his fist on my back.

506
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,860
And then I felt the warm blood going down,
you know?

507
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:00,950
And then later on they found out,
it's like, I don't know, it's weird.

508
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:04,610
It's like it happens so fast or
something combined with adrenaline,

509
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,130
you don't feel that the
destruction part of it, you know?

510
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,580
And it depends what it hits.
And it does depend on what it hits.

511
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,970
That's crazy sentence. Felt
like hot water that, you know.

512
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,110
Yeah. Actually I had a guy,
one of my guys got shot.

513
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:21,880
He was out, you know, firefight
going on and all of a sudden he's,

514
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,500
he feels the hot,

515
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,530
you know, the hot kind of dripping
down his back, hot liquid,

516
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,520
dripping down his back.

517
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,290
And it turned out he had just been shot
in the camel back in the camel camel

518
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:36,120
back. You know, those, they're
like thermoses, they're like a,

519
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,430
they're soft canteens you wear when
you're back and it was hot out.

520
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:45,440
So the water up and you started off,
he shot, he thought he got shot,

521
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,890
but it actually just
hit his game while back.

522
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,420
I remember my toenail fell off right in,

523
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:55,700
in training that I stubbed that on
a corner and I almost passed up.

524
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,650
So you kind of consider the destruction,
you know,

525
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,220
you kind of compare them.

526
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,590
It's almost like taking a bullet would
be less painful then ripping out echoes

527
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:07,201
toenail.
Well,

528
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:12,201
it was my toenail got ripped off and then
so it was jacked up for a few days and

529
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:16,270
then I stubbed that on the corner of uh,
I think it was like,

530
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,930
well you got a bunch
of nerves in your toes.

531
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,620
That's where he got fingernails
or toenails. And again,

532
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,100
the most important thing is
where, you know, what does that,

533
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,710
what does that bullet hit? What does that
blade hit? What does it do to you? Yeah.

534
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,440
Does it hit the, does it
hit a nerve or not? Yeah,

535
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,370
and the adrenaline because when
I got my tone, no ripped off,

536
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:38,870
he would hit at this weird angle where
it just peeled back my whole big toenail

537
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,110
and it didn't really hurt that much
because I was rolling, you know,

538
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:44,720
the adrenaline and stuff. But if I
just sat there and said, Hey Jocko,

539
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:48,530
peel back my toenail like that,
it probably hurt way more.

540
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,820
It would hurt way more
because you'd be in fallen.

541
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,940
Alright, here we go. Back
to the book. The for Raiders

542
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,940
of machine guns of any sorts
are targets for all rifleman's.

543
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,240
Their vulnerability in action gave
rise to the term suicide squad.

544
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,720
Sergeant Felix called to one of
the runners to bring him the gun.

545
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,720
The runner dropped dead as
he handed the gun to Felix.

546
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,770
We advanced the German third line
trench fighting desperately meanwhile,

547
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,030
and driving the Germans before us.

548
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,870
I had not reached any
of them with my bayonet,

549
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,090
but had been doing the deadly work with
my rifle as we rushed to the German

550
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:35,840
trench expecting to jump down into it
and fight hand to hand with the enemy.

551
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,030
We saw that we could not do this.

552
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,600
The trench was covered thoroughly with
barbed wire so that nothing much larger

553
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,800
than a hummingbird could get in.

554
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,110
We laid down outside the pair of Pitta
fire at close range. Someone shouted,

555
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:57,000
look out, there's a bomb. It went
off. It went right off in my face,

556
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,540
but all my parts seem to be
present immediately afterwards.

557
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,850
I saw Felix lying there sprawled
out groping for his pistol. I said,

558
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:08,280
what's the matter bill?
He couldn't answer,

559
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,430
but turned weekly to me and I saw that
half his face seem to been torn off.

560
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,920
I picked up the automatic rifle and
as I turned it into the German trench,

561
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,400
they got up and ran back.
I was the only one firing.

562
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,300
I saw many of them drop with a 60
shots a minute. I was pumping it down.

563
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,410
So I knew I was getting enough of the
enemy to make up for our men who had been

564
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:35,610
killed and wounded for a time and
there was nothing to shoot at.

565
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,760
So I took stock of the situation so far
back that they were hardly more than

566
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:44,640
specs.
I saw tiny men in blue dicking in.

567
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,430
It must've been all of a half a mile.

568
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,960
I knew that we should not stay
out here in such an isolated post,

569
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,340
but what were we to do?

570
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,300
I never thought for a minute
of abandoning the wounded.

571
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,740
So there we stayed.
The snipers far off in the wood.

572
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:05,340
We're still firing at us and there was
no way we could reach them or entirely

573
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:08,820
escaped their bullets.
I couldn't get into the trench,

574
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:13,260
so I call it crawled around
it well over into the woods.

575
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,510
Shell holes everywhere.

576
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,380
I saw for the first time what have it
could be wrought by shell fire at places.

577
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:24,150
The show holes were connected
solidly to each other.

578
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,220
The trees and bushes were shattered.
Men were blown up and blown up again.

579
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,170
They were in pieces.

580
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,330
It would have taken a Bushel basket
or a Gi can two of gather up all those

581
00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:37,560
Germans for burial.

582
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,300
I admit that they were the finest
of soldiers after four years of war.

583
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,930
They fought to the death before we,
before they would give up a position.

584
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,860
They were so well trained that
it was second nature with them.

585
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,560
They had been regimented for so long,

586
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:58,820
but they never questioned in order put
up with all sorts of privation suffering

587
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,350
and we're cheerful through it all.

588
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,840
The majority of them were
in very good condition.

589
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:07,480
When captured it showed
they could take it.

590
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,070
I often wondered if our own men could
be as good soldiers after four years of

591
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:16,840
war.
All of us could not be brave.

592
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,510
Bravery is a sort of fixed quality,
something that some men's have,

593
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,730
some men have and others do.
Not.

594
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,710
Only physical collapse
or death stops the brave.

595
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,830
Some will be brave when they must win.

596
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:39,130
They like mother animal are driven by
this instinct of self preservation to

597
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:42,280
protect their own lives or
that of their offspring.

598
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,020
A man who naturally has
courage is fortunate.

599
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,010
It is the ability to control his mind,

600
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,370
to prepare it so that he feels nothing.

601
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,130
Courage is the product of physical
strength and mental strength. Combined.

602
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,330
Proper training will make
men more courageous and
certainly these Germans were

603
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:08,950
courageous,

604
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,620
physical strength and
mental strength combined.

605
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,320
That's where that courage comes from.
Back to the book,

606
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,760
I tried to do something for the wounded.
They were very cold by this time,

607
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:28,720
suffering from loss of blood. They
were lying there stripped to the waist.

608
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,390
I reached for the canteen
of one of the dead men.

609
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,750
There were two bullet holes
through mine and it was an empty.

610
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,360
Just as I turned a bullet from a far off
to the left toward through the flesh of

611
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:43,720
my cheek.
Had I not turned at that very instant,

612
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,670
it would have gone through my head dead
center killing me or sadly may me me for

613
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:49,504
life

614
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,280
little vote Shona who laid
there was just 16 years of age.

615
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,610
He was the first of a dozen youngsters
whose ages range from 14 to 16 who would

616
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:05,470
have listed in our company.

617
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,770
They had lied about their actual age,
uh,

618
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:12,670
neighbored with the appearance
of our fellows in uniform.

619
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,820
They too wanted to be soldiers.

620
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,070
Some of them lost their nerve before
they reached the front and tried in many

621
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:22,690
ways to get out of service.

622
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,830
The Spencer Brothers 15 and 16 years
of age were to be killed by shell fire.

623
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,240
There was no fear in
this little Italian boy.

624
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,890
He's talking about little vote Shona.

625
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,100
He'd always been a hot tea hothead,
wanting to fight with a knife,

626
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,150
fork or anything he could lay his hands
on when someone antagonized him a bit.

627
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,430
He was dashing forward with bayoneted
rifles in hand so fast when the bullet

628
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,440
which killed him,
which hate him,

629
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,990
that he lay out well on the Barb
wire covering the German trench

630
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,420
kids 1415 and 16 years old.

631
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,183
I don't,

632
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,570
I'm not saying anything bad about
our current state in America,

633
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:22,650
but I have a hard time picturing the
current brood of 1415 and 16 year olds

634
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,460
getting their trench warfare on

635
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,920
1415 and 16 years old.

636
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,430
Okay.

637
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,040
Face to face with the Germans.

638
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,253
Okay.

639
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,860
Back to the book. I crawled back
and there was one of our men crying.

640
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,210
I asked him why and he replied that so
many of his friends had been killed.

641
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,590
I told him not to worry about the
killed that we had living wounded,

642
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,950
to be concerned about to get back,

643
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:04,590
that he'd better go for help
and stretchers and see if
we could not evacuate our

644
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:05,434
fellows.

645
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:15,040
I had no other thought then that I
should die as bravely as I could for my

646
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:17,530
friends or country or something.

647
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:21,940
So I prepared to sell my
life as dearly as possible.

648
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,870
In a surprisingly few minutes,
there came a crashing through the woods,

649
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,680
the sound of voices and a large
body of men came into view.

650
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,451
I lay,

651
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:37,770
still waited until they were close and
then jumped up pointing my automatic

652
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:40,230
rifle at them and it was
prepared to go into action.

653
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,610
I suppose it was a very startling
to have a dead men jump up for,

654
00:42:45,611 --> 00:42:47,170
I certainly looked dead.

655
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,420
I pulled the trigger and as soon
as one man fell, the other roles,

656
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:58,350
the others all shouted comrade.
It's like holding up a train.

657
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,510
No one wants to be the first killed.

658
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,390
So a crowded car permits
a one man to hold it up.

659
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,850
When the Germans found that I had stopped
firing, they were anxious to surrender.

660
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,790
There officer was as nice and polite
as any headwaiter in a high class

661
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,624
restaurant.

662
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,350
Yeah,

663
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,390
he knew a little English and understood.

664
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:20,300
And when I told him to have his
men pile the arms in one place,

665
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,380
put their packs and another and make
improvised stretchers to carry back the

666
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:25,214
wounded.

667
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,010
Okay.

668
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,330
This all took her just a few minutes
and soon we were starting back.

669
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,400
So the tough Germans,

670
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:40,350
he ended up capturing a bunch of Germans
and he actually actually makes a funny

671
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,184
comment here

672
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,700
that he says that as he was walking
back with all these Germans that he had

673
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:48,300
captured,

674
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,250
a couple of the guys now helped him once
he got off the front lines and he says

675
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:58,251
that his award says that he had assisted
in the capture of 38 Germans and he can

676
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:03,330
see he's kind of upset about that cause
he did it by himself. He didn't assist.

677
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:04,860
He got the whole thing done.

678
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,463
Yeah.

679
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,850
And now he ends up,
because the wounds that he suffered,

680
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,440
he ends up in the hospital.

681
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,760
Then he starts having faults
and explaining what it's
like being in the hospital

682
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:18,230
and the people that
are in there with them.

683
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:25,230
Youth of all nations
seldom reckons the cost.

684
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,480
Okay.

685
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,800
They make the best soldiers because they
will go out and try to die bravely for

686
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,900
their,
as I expected and tried to do.

687
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,540
Older men are more cautious.
They have homes,

688
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,680
perhaps families positions
they know about life.

689
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,500
They usually know the folly of war.

690
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:51,830
They are careful and battles
are not won by being careful.

691
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:53,520
Yeah.

692
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,540
The impetuous youthful
soldiers are the best fighters.

693
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,270
That's why war will always take the
flower of the manhood of the nations

694
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,660
involved the strongest,
most intelligence,

695
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,910
most of useful of men.

696
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,463
Okay.

697
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,260
Now he starts talking about what happens.

698
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:17,690
He's again still in the hospital
trying to recover from the wounds he's,

699
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,050
he has his wounds obviously aren't as bad
as some of the other wounded that he's

700
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:22,884
in there with.

701
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,193
Okay.

702
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,900
Back to the book. When a man was
dying, they would move him out.

703
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,353
It was not,

704
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:37,510
it was bad enough for him to die without
his comrades who did not know when

705
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:41,690
their own turn might come,
having to watch him die.

706
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,270
Some of the men went out
screaming when they were moved.

707
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,740
The nurses would try and ease their
going by telling them that they were only

708
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:56,030
going to the operating room for minor
treatment or to the dressing room to have

709
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,410
their bandages changed.

710
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,700
The fellows soon learn to
observe whether the little bag,

711
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:04,560
which held their personal belongings.

712
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,800
Sometimes a helmet or
a coat came with them.

713
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:09,933
Yeah.

714
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,650
If it remained behind,
they could expect to come back,

715
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,630
but if it too was moved, then they were
sure that worst was in store for them.

716
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:19,940
Okay.

717
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,000
Some beg to be left there to die
with their friends around them,

718
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,890
not to be placed with a lot of near
corpses who were complete strangers.

719
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,140
The more pitifully wounded
did not wish to live.

720
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,220
They constantly begged doctors and nurses
sometimes at the top of their voices

721
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,670
to put an end to them.

722
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:47,750
Some made attempts to end their
lives with a knife or fork.

723
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,200
He became necessary to feed these wounded
and never leave a knife or a fork with

724
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:55,034
them

725
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,950
are blinded man who is suffering
greatly and did not wish to live,

726
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:02,990
had killed himself with a fork.

727
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,410
It was hard to drive it deep enough
through his chest to end his life and he

728
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:14,411
kept hitting it with his
clenched fist to drive it deeper.

729
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,240
That is,

730
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,340
I guess about as bad as it gets

731
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,760
when you have individuals that survived
combat butter and such a wretched state

732
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,473
that

733
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,660
no soldier killed himself with a fork.

734
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:46,993
Yeah,

735
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,730
they know what of one of my guys,
one of my buddies,

736
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:58,010
Ryan job, he, he got blinded the in
both eyes after he took around to the,

737
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,023
to the face.

738
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,063
And

739
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,430
it really does show you,
I mean,

740
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:09,850
I would talk to him on the phone when
we were still over there and just,

741
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:14,851
his attitude was so indomitable.

742
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,070
His spirit was so strong.

743
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,710
And I'll tell you something else,

744
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,120
he had been sent to at one point,

745
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:30,121
he was sent to the place where they have
the guys that have had traumatic brain

746
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,533
injuries,

747
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:36,190
who are having trouble with their thoughts
and with their motor skills and guys

748
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:40,780
that are in really bad shape.
And when he was there,

749
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:44,530
and I talked to him on the phone,
he spent about a week there,

750
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,860
Teddy told me, you know, hey, I'm
moving. I'm a, I think, I think he'd,

751
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:51,700
he'd already left,
but he said,

752
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,740
basically told them,
hey, get me outta here.

753
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:01,030
I don't need to kind of help with these
guys needs. I'm taken up someone's bed.

754
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:04,240
So even though he was blind,

755
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,960
and of course he was a tough bastard,
but I mean tough bastard or not,

756
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,840
he was blind.
I mean that's a game changer obviously,

757
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:16,630
but he still looked at the guys that
were wounded worse than him and was like,

758
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:21,250
Hey, I don't want to take up anybody's
bed. I'm good. I'll be okay. I can't see,

759
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:26,190
but I'm good. Did you say you
went to come back to oh yeah,

760
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,160
yeah, of course. Yeah. He,

761
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,400
he was like telling me,
just let me come back.

762
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,160
Let me come back and I can,
I can,

763
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,950
I can stand watch cause I can smell them.

764
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,660
And unfortunately he didn't
get a chance to go back.

765
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,950
So now there's a,
them,

766
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,510
the Germans had made a drive for,

767
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,420
for Paris and the Americans were
now involved in a counter attack and

768
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,820
Bob Hoffman is still in the hospital and
now the wound it start coming in from

769
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:11,750
this counter attack.

770
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,600
The wounded that came in now
were particularly serious cases.

771
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,720
Men who had been wounded
by tremendous shells.

772
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,270
There was much screaming in anguish
displayed by the solely wounded men.

773
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,520
Seldom

774
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,810
was it quiet at night,

775
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,880
man who's nerves broke would
be screaming all night.

776
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,260
There were many cases of shell shock men
who had had their maniacal moments when

777
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:47,240
they felt that they were still at the
front being subjected to shell fire.

778
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,040
They were out of their minds and there
was nothing that could be done about it.

779
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,870
But it made it most unpleasant
for the other wounded,

780
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,210
horrible cases of mustard gas.
We're everywhere.

781
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,610
Some of these men were blinded
and had to lie for endless days.

782
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,980
Would their heads covered with bandages?

783
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:14,400
Some of the men were able to walk,

784
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,760
sprayed a legged down the isles.

785
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,840
I was told that their testicles had in
some cases shriveled up like dry peas in

786
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:28,130
a pod.
They were certainly in a bad way.

787
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,280
So the mustard gas,

788
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,853
it

789
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:41,600
attacks the softest part of your
tissues, right? So your eyes,

790
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:44,060
your nose,
your testicles,

791
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:48,290
like anywhere where there's
moisture and softness.

792
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,033
And

793
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,220
on the 21st of July,

794
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,540
the doctors decide that he's
fit to go back to the front.

795
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,590
He gets on a train queue.
Imagine you go,

796
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,770
you fight this battle,
you get wounded and you come back.

797
00:52:05,771 --> 00:52:10,360
You're watching guys come in that
are severely wounded, shell shock,

798
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:14,200
mustard gas, and then they say, okay,
by the way, now you're good to go.

799
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,840
We're going to send you back out to
the front like you think you got that

800
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:19,750
million dollar wound that we talk about
and a bunch of these episodes where

801
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:23,230
people say, oh, I made it off the
front. He goes off the front for,

802
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:24,340
I don't even think it's a month,

803
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,630
I think it's a few weeks and
now you're fit for duty again,

804
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,920
back to the front, back to the
front, back to the meat grinder

805
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:41,480
and he'd goes there by train
and a surprisingly short
time at about two o'clock

806
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:44,570
we were close enough to the front that
we had started to see the dead soldiers

807
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:46,310
of both armies along the way.

808
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,170
The American soldiers had been buried
hastily and holes they had dug along the

809
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:52,520
road as they were advancing,

810
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,850
but there were still many of
them laying in the fields.

811
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,310
I could see their khaki uniforms and
they're white faces as we passed.

812
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:09,390
There are two chief reasons why a soldier
feels fear first that you will not get

813
00:53:10,511 --> 00:53:12,310
home to see his loved ones again,

814
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:17,650
but most of all picturing himself in the
same position as some of the dead men

815
00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:22,170
we saw. They laid their
face up usually in the rain.

816
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:27,330
Their Eyes Open. Their face is Pale
and chalk. They're gold teeth showing

817
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,770
that is in the beginning.
After that,

818
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:36,570
they are usually too horrible to think
about. We buried them as fast as we could.

819
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,560
Germans, French and Americans
alike, get them out of sight,

820
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,840
but not out of memory.

821
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,800
I can remember hundreds
and hundreds of dead men.

822
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:51,660
I would know them now if I were
to meet them in the hereafter,

823
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:57,210
I could tell them where they were laying
and how they were killed, whether boots,

824
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:01,240
Shell, fire, gas, machine, gun or bayonet.

825
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,080
Yeah.

826
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,160
In the beginning we had a fear of
the dead. We hated to touch them.

827
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,620
Some of the hardest experience of my life,

828
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,040
we're taking the identification
tags from my dead friends.

829
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,660
The first dead man I touched
was Philip Becket ditch,

830
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,660
an Austrian Baker who is with our company.

831
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,180
I tried to save his life by carrying
him through heavy enemy fire and putting

832
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,700
them in one of the sellers
of the French houses.

833
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,440
He was shot in my arms as I carried him.

834
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:36,020
Yeah.

835
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:40,400
A few hours later I found time
to go round and find how he was.

836
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,720
He was dead,
stiff and cold.

837
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:46,600
Okay.

838
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,770
I had to remove his identification tags
and they slipped down between his collar

839
00:54:50,771 --> 00:54:52,900
bones and the flesh of his chest.

840
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,920
They were held there and it
took an effort to get them out.

841
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,730
I thrilled and chilled with
horror has I touched him.

842
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,220
It was hard to touch
these dead men at first.

843
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,510
My people at home hearing of what I was
passing through expected me to come back

844
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:15,390
hard, brutal, callous, careless,

845
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,900
but I didn't even want to take a dead
mouse out of the trap. When I got home.

846
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:25,670
You had over there.
I buried 78 men one morning.

847
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,700
I didn't dig the holes for them of course,

848
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,420
but I did take their personal belongings
from them to return to their people,

849
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,900
their rings, Trinkets, letters,

850
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:38,300
and identification tags.

851
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:40,643
Okay.

852
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,860
You hear these days,
you know,

853
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:48,861
people will talk about seeing a dead body
and how that's a traumatic experience.

854
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:54,330
And as a matter of fact,
my son, uh, he has,

855
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,360
he found a dead body one down on the beach
and one guy fell off the cliff and by

856
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:05,790
my house I saw that in the news, but
right, right, right. And you know,

857
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:08,220
people were saying, Oh, you know,
you should, you should, you know,

858
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:11,730
make sure you talk about it with them
and make sure he's okay and all that,

859
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,290
you know, great. You're concerned.
But can you imagine, I mean,

860
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:20,550
you're just seeing dead body after dead
body after dead body, after dead body,

861
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:24,100
after dead body, after dead
body, it goes on and on and on.

862
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,870
Yeah, like that kind of, this kind of,

863
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,990
if you're in that environment,
sometimes it could,

864
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,500
you could have that kind of
desensitized, you know, feeling.

865
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,580
But I would imagine you would really come
to get you after everything calms down.

866
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,470
You know, like, like how he was saying he,

867
00:56:46,471 --> 00:56:50,490
he didn't even want to take a mouse out
of the child dead mouse because it's a

868
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:55,440
reminder in this calm environment or
reminder of just all that death, you know?

869
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:58,800
But at,
yeah,

870
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:02,220
at the time it seems like they're
almost like there could be two kinds of

871
00:57:02,221 --> 00:57:06,570
reactions to it where they either get
used to it or get tired of it kind of

872
00:57:06,571 --> 00:57:09,060
thing. And then so if you get tired
of it, it was just way on your way,

873
00:57:09,061 --> 00:57:10,620
on your way on you.
But if you get used to it,

874
00:57:10,621 --> 00:57:14,220
it just gets less and less
impactful, you know? Yeah.

875
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:18,310
Well obviously they had to deal with it.
They had to detach from it. You couldn't,

876
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:18,541
I mean,

877
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:21,390
it's just like you talked to a doctor
that's been in practice for a long time.

878
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:24,810
Eventually they cannot get emotionally
attached to every patient as they had.

879
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:27,660
Or they would go completely insane.
They wouldn't be able to do the job.

880
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:28,560
And it's the same thing here.

881
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:32,520
Obviously you can't get emotionally
attached to every single body that he's

882
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:36,620
dealing with. But you can tell that
it leaves a mark. Yes, fully. And,

883
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:41,040
and you'd think that, I mean, the
doctors, the good little analogy,

884
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,410
but the thing that the doctor has,
and I was talking to Luke, you know,

885
00:57:43,411 --> 00:57:47,130
Doctor Luke here, we're talking about it.
Um, jade asked him that question like,

886
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,960
it does it ever weird you out when you,
you know,

887
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:50,670
you're operating on somebody or whatever.

888
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,510
And what doctors get is this sense of,
okay,

889
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:58,500
so the not only the job,
but it's almost like working on a car,

890
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,900
cause you kind of know all of the little
working parts and you can fix them,

891
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,290
fused them together and boom,
it works. Now, you know,

892
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:08,490
kind of still there's that element of
thinking. Um, and then, yeah, sure.

893
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:11,550
On the other side it's a person.
And if you know the guy, you know,

894
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:12,750
it might even be more personal,

895
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:18,020
but in war it seems way more dark because
the guy's not supposed to be dead.

896
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,150
The, you know, the goal is
to live and to win the war.

897
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,780
Death is literally like the worst case
scenario for the person or one of them.

898
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,550
So when you see someone dead,
it's like man, it's not,

899
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,350
it's part of the job, but it's not the,
the, the outcome that you're, the goal,

900
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:39,030
you know, it's no part of the goal is
to die ever. It's like the bad part. So

901
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,500
it can't be substituted
with, Hey, you know,

902
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:48,120
that you can't substitute your thinking
in regards to this dead person with,

903
00:58:48,121 --> 00:58:50,490
you know, part of being part
of my goal of my job, you know,

904
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,310
all I will say that, you know,
when you've got at least we had a,

905
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:00,480
we have a volunteer military
service and everybody that joins up,

906
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:01,970
okay.

907
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:05,870
No. So that's part of the
risk of the job. So at least,

908
00:59:05,871 --> 00:59:09,590
even though that's obviously not the goal,
you know,

909
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:14,591
that guys have at least come
to grips with the reality that,

910
00:59:15,231 --> 00:59:17,630
that that's what they
may face. Yeah. Fully.

911
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,280
Kind of like if you're a fighter in
the gay, uh, you know, getting knocked

912
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,730
out, seen a guy get knocked out or broken
leg or something like that, it's weak.

913
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,600
It's part of the game, you
know, but um, obviously way,

914
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,910
not quite as heavy as the war
situation. Yeah. So speaking of which,

915
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,860
back to the book,
here they are,

916
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:41,950
he's now just fighting and
he's with another guy named
Vaughn and Vaughn kind of

917
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,760
pokes his head up above this barricade
and start shooting and he's kind of

918
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:52,100
looking at it,
I'm thinking that seems pretty dangerous.

919
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:53,750
But he sees Vaughn getting away with it.

920
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,960
So he gets up there too and
starts shooting and soon
there they're firing shots.

921
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,130
And then back to the book here.
But after several shots each,

922
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,730
I suddenly saw Vaughn's helmet go
sailing down over the slight hill.

923
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:13,930
I looked at him and the entire top of
his head was off apparently a dumb dumb

924
01:00:14,151 --> 01:00:14,984
type bullet,

925
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,790
one in which the lead had been cut so
that it would spread in the instant struck

926
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,690
during a terrific hole
in the object it hit,

927
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:27,890
had flattened against his
helmet or tin hat and had taken,

928
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:32,891
is taken off his head to a
level with his eyes and ears.

929
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,570
He had been kneeling and his buttocks
went back a bit his head forward.

930
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,920
And his brains ran out there in
front of me, like soup from a pot.

931
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,773
Yeah,

932
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:47,330
I did not fire over another wall.

933
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:54,190
The sniper had his choice to pick one
or the other of us for some unknown

934
01:00:55,461 --> 01:01:00,440
reason. He chose Vaughn.
I'm here and he's gone.

935
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,790
Von Lay there for a couple of days.
Finally,

936
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:09,791
he was carried down and stored in the
room where we had the other dead piled up

937
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:11,360
like logs of wood,

938
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,700
but he had to have his
own place in the corner.

939
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,670
It was gruesome enough.

940
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:24,683
Okay.

941
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,650
The nerve strain of the
constant gas attacks was severe.

942
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,810
We were wakened up at every hour of
the day and night to stand too in

943
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,450
preparation for an attack
to prepare to move on,

944
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,390
or at least put our gas masks on,

945
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:50,320
but now they're getting ready to
do another assault.

946
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,320
One of the greatest barrages into history.

947
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:58,330
The war was being put over the earth
and the air constantly trembled with the

948
01:01:58,481 --> 01:01:59,980
force of explosions.

949
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,730
Each flare would show us the
details of no man's land,

950
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:08,530
no man's land between the lines dead
men were laying everywhere in the most

951
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:12,730
grotesque positions.
Some of them lay as if sound asleep.

952
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,800
One man's head rested so comfortably on
his arm that I could not believe you is

953
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:18,634
dead.

954
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:24,040
Others had been blown to pieces several
times and some were just arms and legs

955
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,060
or torsos.

956
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:29,620
This night approach to
the front made us sick.

957
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:31,950
Okay?

958
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:36,420
As we finally found the men we were to
relieve, we were all thoroughly sick.

959
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,040
The ground was rotten with
tear and vomiting. Gas,

960
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,710
mustard gas too was all around.

961
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,050
War is bad enough without
the constant torture of gas.

962
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:50,520
Okay?

963
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,330
There was a constant cry for
stretcher bearers for the Red Cross,

964
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,930
the most diabolical screaming and
moaning that could be imagined.

965
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,240
Yeah.

966
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,550
Human beings lying helpless.

967
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:06,590
No way to fight back not knowing who
would be killed by the next shell.

968
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:12,380
It is hard to be brave at
night shelling at night.

969
01:03:12,381 --> 01:03:14,570
Saps the courage from the bravest.

970
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:20,310
Everyone lies there and shakes only the
strongest can keep their right minds.

971
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,120
Okay?

972
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,350
It is on such nights as this
that men go out of their heads.

973
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:32,890
One will never know how he will behave
in such an ordeal. Some men weep,

974
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,100
other shake,
some standup nonchalantly,

975
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,050
apparently not caring whether they get
killed or wounded. Some tell crude jokes,

976
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:44,470
but mostly the men dig and dig.

977
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,290
Set is only the direct
hits that will get them

978
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,950
Grimley and during the torture,

979
01:03:50,951 --> 01:03:55,510
that human being subject each other
to not knowing who will go next.

980
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,280
Okay.

981
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,660
We spent five days in that place,
which was popularly called death valley.

982
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,740
I don't know whether there was any
real object and staying in dying there,

983
01:04:06,741 --> 01:04:10,130
but we were ordered into that
valley and there we stayed.

984
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,010
Yeah.

985
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:16,390
There were always a few maniacs around
men who had lost their mind through shell

986
01:04:16,391 --> 01:04:18,880
fire and had to be overpowered and bound.

987
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:20,280
Okay.

988
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,140
Some men were buried alive and we were
constantly busy digging out the live

989
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:25,974
ones.

990
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:26,930
Okay.

991
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:29,180
Many would be smothered
before we could get them out.

992
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,430
At times we would have a group of wounded
and stretcher bearers making their way

993
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:38,450
up the hill. A shell would fall among
them in nearly all would be killed.

994
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:43,470
So many men were wounded,
wounded again,

995
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,410
and we're still under fire.

996
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:53,360
Sometimes we found two or three men dead
together and so badly mixed up that we

997
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:57,350
could not tell whether we got the
right parts in the right grave or not.

998
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,050
The men suffered and so did the horses.

999
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,140
Yeah.

1000
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:10,250
One of my most painful memories at the
front was seeing a shell dropped near to

1001
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:11,480
artillery horses.

1002
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:16,430
The horses broke away from the tree to
which they were secured and galloped up

1003
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:20,470
through the field.
One of the horses was hitting the abdomen.

1004
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,460
It's in test is it's an
testings dropped out,

1005
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,200
dragged on the ground and soon it's feet
were entangled and its own intestines

1006
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:32,080
to the point where it fell down
and could not run any further.

1007
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:33,470
Okay.

1008
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:37,370
Hey, lay there with its head up for what
seemed like to be an endless period.

1009
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:43,100
It seemed to be more surprised concerning
how it had become entangled in its own

1010
01:05:43,101 --> 01:05:44,780
parts than in the pain.

1011
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:46,510
Yeah,

1012
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:51,510
we were sorry that was so situated by
this time that it was difficult to put it

1013
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:56,860
out of its misery. I think most
people when they think of horses,

1014
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:03,770
you just think of a beautiful creature
running free

1015
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,040
and now you have this image
for the rest of your life.

1016
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,270
Okay.

1017
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:16,270
There was intense fighting at a place
called surgey and the usual atrocity

1018
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:19,790
stories.
We heard many of them.

1019
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,220
They went something like this.

1020
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:27,830
A two year old girl got in the way of
a marching column of German troops,

1021
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:31,670
a soldier bay and edit it and
carried it away on his bay. Annette

1022
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,190
children were slaughtered
for no apparent motive.

1023
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,450
The soldiers tied up civilian prisoners,
prodded them with bayonets,

1024
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,570
put lit cigarettes in their
noses and ears and shot them.

1025
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:49,270
Eyes were burned out with red hot pokers
civilian snipers were tortured in every

1026
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:52,150
possible way.
In Vimeo.

1027
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:57,420
They had been spread eagled in the public
square or wrap would be placed under

1028
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:03,001
an iron kettle upon the man or
woman's bare abdomen than a fire bill,

1029
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,420
a top the kettle,

1030
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,700
the victim was tortured
first by the frantic running
around of the rat on his or

1031
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:14,080
her bare abdomen when it became nearly
smothered and terror stricken and pain

1032
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:15,580
filled from the smoke and heat.

1033
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:20,380
Then it would eat down through the body
of the humans living flesh to escape.

1034
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,190
We found the dead body of a girl.

1035
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,180
Her arms were nailed to the
door and extended fashion.

1036
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:32,520
Her left breast was half cut away.

1037
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,280
A young boy of five or six years of age
lay on a doorstep with his two hands,

1038
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:43,281
nearly severed from his arms but still
hanging to them at another place where

1039
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:47,510
the board of the dead bodies of a
man and woman or girl and the boy,

1040
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:52,400
each of them had both hands cut off at
the wrist and both feet above the ankle.

1041
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,950
Child of seven beheaded,

1042
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:59,420
a whole family killed including a young
girl because the girl would not give

1043
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:04,250
herself to the Germans
burn to death in their houses.

1044
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:09,080
All the women violated the
entire German regimen, drunk,

1045
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,273
et cetera.

1046
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:16,760
The above are exact quotations from
the Bryce report which specialized in

1047
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:18,830
outrages against women and children.

1048
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:24,020
They are samples of the sort of
stories we were always hearing.

1049
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:31,710
He goes on to say that he never
saw personally these things,

1050
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,310
but this is the kind of things that
they heard about happening all the time

1051
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:49,150
and they're getting ready
for another counter attack.

1052
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,830
A court council of war brought the
decision that we would cross the bridge in

1053
01:08:52,831 --> 01:08:57,831
day light demand got ready to move and
we prepared to rush across the bridge

1054
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:59,560
three or four at a time.

1055
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:05,850
The ranks of every company
had been decimated and
probably our outfit consisted

1056
01:09:06,371 --> 01:09:10,180
of only four or 500 man instead
of the full strength 1000 men.

1057
01:09:10,181 --> 01:09:11,014
There should have been.

1058
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,880
There were dead Germans all around,
but I could see one particularly well.

1059
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,560
He'd been coming up the street,

1060
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:25,280
passed one of the garden walls
and had been hit with a shell.

1061
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:30,430
His legs were laying on this side of
the wall were lying there like they had

1062
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:35,801
been taking from some gigantic frog
while on the other side of the wall,

1063
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,960
the whole the shell made,
I could see the rest of his body.

1064
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:44,090
He was a powerful appearing man in his
early twenties with a thick shock of

1065
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:47,570
blonde hair.
His eyes were wide open.

1066
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,030
He never knew what hit him.

1067
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,340
About the middle of the afternoon,

1068
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:58,460
the Germans tried another counter attack
and we helped the defenders behind the

1069
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:00,710
barricade and in the houses
farther up the street.

1070
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:03,830
By sniping from the second
floor of the houses we occupied,

1071
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:08,720
we were prepared to stop the attack if
it had penetrated down the street to our

1072
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:13,250
positions firing over the heads
of men behind the barricade,

1073
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:18,460
we were able to assist in stopping this
counter attack the Germans to had their

1074
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:20,660
snipers to cover the advance of their men.

1075
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:25,640
I remember one who's firing very
carefully from a window in a house,

1076
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:26,630
well up the street.

1077
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:31,340
I took careful aim and he fell
forward out of the window.

1078
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,340
During all this fighting,

1079
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:39,080
the air was filled with dust
and with the fumes of powder.

1080
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,240
They burnt our noses,

1081
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:45,260
throat and lungs to such an extent that
we could not tell if gas was in the air

1082
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,480
and it's this point,

1083
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,920
they're trying to make progress and
they get caught in a horrible crossfire

1084
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:57,230
flanking fire.

1085
01:10:59,060 --> 01:10:59,893
Okay

1086
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,780
frontal fire is bad enough,

1087
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:06,781
but flanking fire as suicidal men
were getting hit all around us.

1088
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:08,310
They were calling for stretchers,

1089
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:12,160
trying to apply their own first aid
kits on every side and some of them were

1090
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:14,070
gasping out their breaths

1091
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:17,770
to have come so far,

1092
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:22,980
at least 4,000 miles and to have
their lives snuffed out so wantonly so

1093
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:28,120
uselessly behind this wall
and the backyards of a remote
French village that the

1094
01:11:28,121 --> 01:11:32,980
world would never have heard of were
it not for the action which took place

1095
01:11:32,981 --> 01:11:33,814
there

1096
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,103
and this

1097
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:41,200
defense that they make of this village

1098
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,270
kind of comes down to one final
situation that they're in.

1099
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:51,790
They're holed up in their about
to be attacked by the Germans.

1100
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:53,683
Okay.

1101
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:59,320
Some gas had fallen which added to the
pain and bleeding of the wounded and

1102
01:11:59,321 --> 01:12:04,321
prove to us that no hell in the hereafter
could be greater than this manmade

1103
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:08,770
hell that we were enduring.
Man.

1104
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,880
Men began to go out of their heads shell
shocked if we could call it that or

1105
01:12:12,881 --> 01:12:14,500
just crazy from weakness,

1106
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:19,200
strain suffering and
hungry hunger with all bed.

1107
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:20,590
The death around them.

1108
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:22,760
Yeah,

1109
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,120
it was near the breaking point
for all of us who survived.

1110
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:30,230
We would ask ourselves,
how can there be any more?

1111
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,740
But there was more and worse.

1112
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,520
The night wore on and the morning of the
fifth day was about to break the German

1113
01:12:39,711 --> 01:12:41,480
artillery speeded up again.

1114
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:46,520
We knew that an attack was impending
everywhere. I looked for dead men.

1115
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:51,950
There seemed to be no live men
around to man. The guns here,

1116
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:56,240
they call them were shouted along the
line and many of the nearly dead men rose

1117
01:12:56,241 --> 01:13:00,440
up to man their guns behind the wall
that had become almost a part of us.

1118
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:05,120
Wave after wave of Germans
were coming through the pear,

1119
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:09,560
the pear orchard rifles,
hand grenades and machine guns,

1120
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,790
but worst of all the flame throwers,

1121
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,220
I could see the men plainly,

1122
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,140
they had tanks on their backs and from
the ends of their hoses came great masses

1123
01:13:21,141 --> 01:13:25,790
of liquid fire shooting toward just
at a distance of at least 50 yards.

1124
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,700
The smoke went far beyond us.

1125
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,120
We felt that the heat would burn us up.

1126
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:37,970
Every man able to fire concentrated upon
the men who were operating the flame

1127
01:13:37,971 --> 01:13:42,230
throwers. Almost immediately
they were put out of action.

1128
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:46,910
Their tanks perforated and each
man's body a massive flames.

1129
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,170
The flames leaped and shot into the air.

1130
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:57,970
Voss was the attacks stopped by
the Germans own diabolical weapon.

1131
01:13:59,230 --> 01:13:59,580
Okay.

1132
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,560
They suffered far more than we,

1133
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:03,250
okay?

1134
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:08,250
Never after that in the war
did we encounter that type
of flame thrower again?

1135
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,120
They were real suicide

1136
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:12,953
squad.

1137
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:18,820
The man who operated those tanks were
sure to Sophal a terrible and quick death.

1138
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:21,530
Okay.

1139
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:23,000
It was a narrow escape.

1140
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:24,030
Okay.

1141
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:26,640
There were just a handful of us left.

1142
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:27,640
Okay.

1143
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,370
What do we were relieved that night?

1144
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:30,140
Yeah.

1145
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:34,850
Had staggered across the river.
There were just 32 of us left.

1146
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:36,130
Yeah.

1147
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:39,850
Our companies on the line,
we're almost completely wiped out,

1148
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:43,940
but we had held the line.

1149
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,160
They held the line

1150
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:57,310
adding on fathomable cost in
blood and sanity and lives.

1151
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:03,560
They held the line

1152
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:12,820
in men like Bob Hoffman who
met face to face with hell.

1153
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:14,450
Okay.

1154
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:19,450
An evil and darkness that
crushes you and laughter.

1155
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,830
And for many people it crushes hope.

1156
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,863
Okay.

1157
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:33,600
But Bob Hoffman overcame all of that

1158
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:41,280
and he came back and really from
my perspective through fitness,

1159
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,820
he led an incredible life

1160
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:52,750
and he ended up writing a book about
it and it was called how to be strong,

1161
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,530
healthy and happy,

1162
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,610
and that's a tall order.

1163
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:03,390
That's a tall order who doesn't
want to be strong, healthy and happy

1164
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:10,110
in the book eat. Some of
it's dated, much of it isn't,

1165
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,070
but some of it's dated,
but I,

1166
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,360
I don't want to go deep into the book,

1167
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:20,130
but I do want to hit some highlights
from this book on how to be strong,

1168
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,870
healthy and happy.

1169
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:22,910
Okay.

1170
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,140
Some things to think about.

1171
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:35,910
Bob Hoffman Kiro from World War
One who'd been through hell.

1172
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:46,200
I'm just going to read some quotes
from this. Physical training pays.

1173
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:52,030
I always say that any exercise
is better than no exercise.

1174
01:16:56,370 --> 01:17:01,370
Now he talks about sleep a little bit in
those folks out there that harassed me

1175
01:17:02,161 --> 01:17:02,994
on Twitter,

1176
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:07,350
doc parsley constantly
harassing me on Twitter.

1177
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:09,740
Tell me to sleep more.

1178
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,370
This is what does it,
what Bob Hoffman had to say about sleep.

1179
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:16,010
There are different speeds of sleep,

1180
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:20,300
some sleep faster than
others and can awake,

1181
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:22,940
refreshed with a moderate
number of hours of sleep,

1182
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:25,760
which would leave others tired and worn

1183
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:33,240
fast sleeping. Is it a result of properly
operating bodily functions of Pref,

1184
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:38,390
perfect functioning of all organs and
it comes to from accustoming the body to

1185
01:17:39,811 --> 01:17:42,000
an hour to less sleep.

1186
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,890
Many great men of history are reported
to have slept only a fraction of the time

1187
01:17:47,891 --> 01:17:50,410
that the average person spends sleeping.

1188
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,110
If we said that Thomas Edison,

1189
01:17:53,111 --> 01:17:56,440
the world famous inventor would
sleep up four hours a night,

1190
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:01,180
but he had a cot in his laboratory
on which you would lie and think,

1191
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:04,030
and his assistants have reported
he took naps during the day.

1192
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,620
Many men who are reporting to
sleep up four hours a night,

1193
01:18:08,621 --> 01:18:13,450
we'll make up for it with naps during
day light hours. So there you go.

1194
01:18:13,451 --> 01:18:17,600
You're good to go.
That's all you need to do.

1195
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:18,640
Is Sleep faster

1196
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:26,400
talking to you, echo, tune in and
what do you get? Nine hours. 10 Hours?

1197
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:30,870
No regular eight I think.
Nice, nice sleep faster.

1198
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,750
Now speaking of that,
too much sleep is not a benefit.

1199
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:39,870
Rather it is depressing causes,

1200
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,780
sluggishness and a state of the Frg.

1201
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,610
I liked that too much sleep.
Take that,

1202
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,870
take that doc parsley out there,
but in all you know doc,

1203
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:59,920
no doc parsley, he trades vaguely. Yeah,
but he's, he's, he's a doctor but he's,

1204
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,740
he's done a lot of stuff with sleep and
studying sleep and he's always giving me

1205
01:19:03,741 --> 01:19:06,920
a hard time because sleep is good for you.
I'm only kidding everybody.

1206
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:09,530
Sleep is definitely good for you.
I should sleep more.

1207
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,970
I just have a hard time doing it.

1208
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:14,660
There's so much to be done in the
world and you're sleeping fast and I am

1209
01:19:14,661 --> 01:19:17,160
sleeping with it faster than
everybody else if it didn't.

1210
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,403
Another quote,

1211
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:26,510
any young man who desires to obtain
the most from life should spend a good

1212
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:29,000
portion of his time
improving himself physically.

1213
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,420
Regardless of your age,

1214
01:19:32,421 --> 01:19:36,250
you should make it a rule to learn
something new each day and to do something

1215
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:38,290
each day to improve yourself physically.

1216
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,770
So he's talking about mental
and physical strength.

1217
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:46,360
He talks about learning stuff, memory,
memorizing stuff, doing math in your head,

1218
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,210
just getting smarter.
I believe we talk about that sometimes.

1219
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,130
The best hobby of all
this physical training.

1220
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:59,340
Concentrate on your activities
instead of worrying about the future.

1221
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:04,341
Welcome the opportunity to face problems
or deals or battles of your life.

1222
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:11,530
You can build yourself so that you
obtained pleasure from overcoming,

1223
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:15,790
from defeating problems,
apparently insurmountable difficulties.

1224
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,730
You can overcome all your difficulties in.

1225
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:22,150
When you will find the
next encounter easier,

1226
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,630
you will have greater
confidence in your own ability,

1227
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:32,260
God problems. Good. Let's face him

1228
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:37,480
and uh, actually I forgot to
mention this, but this book,

1229
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:41,650
I remember the last war I got from
somebody on Twitter and I'm sorry.

1230
01:20:41,651 --> 01:20:43,920
Hey everybody on Twitter. Number one, I,

1231
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:48,520
I don't know if people want
to be mentioned or not.
And also when I transfer,

1232
01:20:48,521 --> 01:20:53,500
what people tell me to the document that
I keep, it doesn't pull their names,

1233
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:57,860
so they're just lost. But usually
people hit me up afterwards and say,

1234
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:01,810
oh right, I gave you that book. So
somebody recommended the book to me.

1235
01:21:01,811 --> 01:21:05,560
I remember the last war and once I started
doing some research about Bob Hoffman

1236
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:10,480
and I saw he had another book that
was literally called how to be strong,

1237
01:21:10,481 --> 01:21:11,350
healthy,
and happy.

1238
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,700
I just ordered immediately so I could
see what he had to say about it all

1239
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,430
and I think, yeah, some
pretty good information.

1240
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,380
Here's another quote.

1241
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:30,480
People who know nothing of the pleasures
and advantages of having super strength

1242
01:21:30,481 --> 01:21:33,190
and health often say
what good are muscles.

1243
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:37,420
They say they have no use for them,
that they are healthy,

1244
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:42,220
but they are only half alive in many
cases for they will never have felt the

1245
01:21:42,221 --> 01:21:44,560
indescribable sense of
power and wellbeing.

1246
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:49,660
The census superiority or
capability that strong persons feel,

1247
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:55,410
many use of eliminated an inferiority
complex by the growing knowledge of the

1248
01:21:55,421 --> 01:22:00,421
power they possessed by their physical
ability or superior already over average

1249
01:22:00,641 --> 01:22:04,840
persons. We might have to do an
ego check here, Bob on that one,

1250
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,070
but actually he's going to ego
check it right here himself.

1251
01:22:09,071 --> 01:22:13,690
I do not mean by this that strong
men should go round bowling others by

1252
01:22:13,691 --> 01:22:17,680
demonstrating their
strength as an actual fact,

1253
01:22:17,681 --> 01:22:20,260
a stronger and more capable a man,

1254
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:24,640
the less likely he is to make a show
of his strength by hurting or fighting

1255
01:22:24,641 --> 01:22:25,474
others.

1256
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:26,730
Okay.

1257
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:31,170
But strength of mind and body does
beget get confidence, determination,

1258
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:35,100
perseverance and many
other admirable qualities.

1259
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:36,633
Okay.

1260
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,290
So I think he, he, he
brought it back around again.

1261
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:45,170
It's for you and I were talking before
the podcast started about how some people,

1262
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,830
if they're a little bit insecure but
they want to be a tough guy. They did.

1263
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:51,170
They got to act like that.
Yeah.

1264
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:54,170
And when you're within your looking at
them kind of like this guy must not be

1265
01:22:54,171 --> 01:22:55,780
that tough cause you've
got to act this way. Yeah.

1266
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:59,190
So they actually are getting less
respect than they think they are. Yup.

1267
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:02,960
But if they actually had
confidence in their situation,

1268
01:23:02,961 --> 01:23:05,500
if they knew that they
could handle themselves,

1269
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,980
they wouldn't be acting like that.

1270
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,333
Yup.

1271
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:16,200
Here's another little
something to think about.

1272
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:21,650
Don't worry about things
that might happen.

1273
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:26,720
Work hard and do the best you can. And
if something happens, it can't be helped.

1274
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,730
Don't give up, never cry over
spilled milk. What is done is done.

1275
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,920
It can't be helped when it's too late.

1276
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:37,980
I survived some apparently
overwhelming difficulties.

1277
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,160
Easily enough with this point of view.

1278
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:46,010
Sort of your basic cause I mean
no use crying over spilled milk.

1279
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,870
Don't abuse down though. Cause
you know how, um, you know,

1280
01:23:50,871 --> 01:23:54,260
people will have the attitude but then
sometimes they'll let it overflow in the,

1281
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:56,690
it'll get,
it'll make itself,

1282
01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:02,420
they'll allow it to be
an excuse to go prepared.

1283
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:06,260
Yeah, no that's, that's not a good idea.
Yeah. Yeah. But it can do it, you know,

1284
01:24:06,261 --> 01:24:09,950
cause it's like a, um, there might
be a small light gray area, you know,

1285
01:24:09,951 --> 01:24:10,731
cause they're like,
oh,

1286
01:24:10,731 --> 01:24:13,180
I don't really care that much about
the outcome and what's going to happen

1287
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:15,830
that's going to happen.
So it might, like I said,

1288
01:24:15,831 --> 01:24:18,590
overflow into the part of
their mind of preparation. Oh,

1289
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,810
don't want to let that
happen. Yeah. So, you know,

1290
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,570
cause the opposite is like if
you obsess over the outcome,

1291
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:27,000
you might obsess over the preparation
maybe. You know what I mean? That's,

1292
01:24:27,001 --> 01:24:31,520
that's those kind of go hand in hand a
little bit. So if you go the opposite,

1293
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:34,400
you know you can get that be like,
Eh, well, whatever's going to happen,

1294
01:24:34,401 --> 01:24:38,490
it's going to happen. So whatever. That's
not the excuse we're looking for. No, no,

1295
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,580
no, no, no. That's what I say.
Be careful of that. You know.

1296
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:47,120
Here we go. A few more of these. If
you want to live long and be healthy,

1297
01:24:47,121 --> 01:24:51,050
strong and happy,
acquire habits of activity right now.

1298
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:55,970
If you are tempted to sit in an easy
chair, find something to keep you busy.

1299
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:00,710
A few minutes to a half an hour
with the weights will be best.

1300
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:05,450
If you find yourself going to the garage
for your car to get to the grocery

1301
01:25:05,451 --> 01:25:09,380
store, walk instead. I
like this one right here.

1302
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:12,200
If you don't feel like
getting dressed to go out,

1303
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:16,760
do it anyways instead of
wine down after a meal.

1304
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:18,140
Find something to do.

1305
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:19,530
Yeah,

1306
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:22,770
don't pass the buck as they say
in the army. Do it yourself.

1307
01:25:22,771 --> 01:25:27,630
If there's an involves muscular action,
clean off the snow, cut the grass,

1308
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:32,370
spade the garden.
That's a good one.

1309
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,950
That's just a general rule.

1310
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:40,270
If you don't feel like something
cause you're being lazy to do it,

1311
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:44,470
don't be lazy. The thing that you
could do tomorrow, do it today,

1312
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:46,270
do that thing today

1313
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:47,563
[inaudible]

1314
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,570
otherwise you get this.
If you put off until another day,

1315
01:25:53,571 --> 01:25:56,360
your good intentions
to normalize your body,

1316
01:25:56,390 --> 01:26:01,390
it won't help the road to despair and
unhappiness is paved with good intentions

1317
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,250
lost along

1318
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,083
the way.

1319
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:10,620
I think he'd just seen him get after it
basically is what I'm getting is what

1320
01:26:10,621 --> 01:26:12,090
I'm getting from Bob Hoffman.

1321
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:19,190
This is just an old school,
just some old schooled mileage right here.

1322
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:24,260
If our country was invaded and our
young men were a lot of cream puffs,

1323
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:29,630
probably cowards through never
having experienced hard work,

1324
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:34,370
athletic competition or a good punch in
the nose, we would lose to the invaders,

1325
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:39,460
lose our freedoms and things
worth more than life itself.

1326
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:43,820
So she's basically saying it'd be
harder. Tough enough, be tougher.

1327
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:46,940
I support this idea a hundred percent

1328
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,320
do things that make you
tougher and better. Yes,

1329
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:56,210
activity is life.
Stagnation is deaf in life.

1330
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,200
There is movement.

1331
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:01,370
These are all well known
truisms and exercise.

1332
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:04,700
Bringing healthful
activity to every organ,

1333
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:09,760
gland and cell of the body keeps the
entire body and mind radially alive and

1334
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:15,830
with a feeling of pep energy and wellbeing
that makes one so buoyant and alive

1335
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,440
that they feel like jumping and running.

1336
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,910
Oh, he's fired up. Exercise
builds coordination, balance,

1337
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:27,830
control of the muscles.
It build speech,

1338
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:32,660
judgment of time and space and distance
makes the entire body more responsive to

1339
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:36,740
the will and he teaches the body to
do the right thing in times of danger,

1340
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:38,900
even before it is directed by the mind.

1341
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:44,090
Exercise is the best.
Insurance against disease or sickness.

1342
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:47,420
Exercise builds confidence for
there is no road to supreme.

1343
01:27:47,421 --> 01:27:52,010
Confidence has sure has the knowledge
of one's physical and mental ability.

1344
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,590
It cultivates power of will,

1345
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:57,650
gives you complete mastery of
your physical and mental self.

1346
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:02,710
Promotes personal efficiency and all
desirable mental characteristics.

1347
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:03,960
Okay.

1348
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,500
Exercise improves the efficiency
of every part of the body.

1349
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:08,710
Okay.

1350
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:13,710
It helps you sleep sounder and faster
so that you have more time for work and

1351
01:28:13,781 --> 01:28:14,614
pleasure.

1352
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:15,620
Yeah,

1353
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,350
makes it possible for you to earn more.

1354
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,440
Exercise,
makes it possible to live more.

1355
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:26,740
Exercise will only take
one 10th of the time.

1356
01:28:26,741 --> 01:28:31,210
You now spend on foolish
expenditures of time and energy.

1357
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:36,160
This is, this is funny because this
is written in like 1930 something.

1358
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:41,850
Now you have time to sit around to
read for entertainment too often true

1359
01:28:42,281 --> 01:28:43,690
detective stories,

1360
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:48,610
other true stories which do you no good
but merely tell you of the troubles of

1361
01:28:48,611 --> 01:28:49,444
others.

1362
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:54,340
You spend a lot of time at the movies
perhaps or listening to the radio in idle

1363
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:57,460
talk or gossip in
watching athletic events,

1364
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:02,100
which put which others put forth
effort and receive benefit,

1365
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:04,050
you know,

1366
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:09,050
add the interweb into that equation and
social media and you've got no time in

1367
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:13,070
the day. Yeah. It's essentially
the Internet is basically all that.

1368
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:16,710
All that one on the computer. Yeah.
All that without moving all that,

1369
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:18,370
just less homes, right? Yeah.

1370
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,960
So it's sure that you can
find time for exercise,

1371
01:29:21,961 --> 01:29:25,440
you to obtain much of what is it
worth in life. You must find time.

1372
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,810
Your health demands it.

1373
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:29,833
Yeah.

1374
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:35,570
And I'm going to wrap it up
right here with this, this one.

1375
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:42,340
But probably you have done as the
majority do drifted along from day to day

1376
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:49,250
promising yourself that you would start
exercising tomorrow or next week or next

1377
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,080
month when the weather becomes cooler.

1378
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,790
Tomorrow comes next week and next month,

1379
01:29:55,820 --> 01:30:00,080
cool weather and even next year comes
and goes and you do nothing about it.

1380
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,800
After years of thinking about
exercise but not acting,

1381
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:06,110
you find the firm rounded,

1382
01:30:06,111 --> 01:30:09,140
attractive muscles of your youth
have changed until the weekend.

1383
01:30:09,141 --> 01:30:11,600
Soft muscles of Middle Age,

1384
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:17,260
you take on a little excess flesh and
make mental note some night when you gaze

1385
01:30:17,301 --> 01:30:20,570
upon yourself in the mirror that
you'll have to do something cut down on

1386
01:30:20,571 --> 01:30:22,910
starches or suites,
get more exercise.

1387
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:27,620
But you've developed an enormous appetite
during these years and at best you

1388
01:30:27,621 --> 01:30:30,320
refrained from eating
sweets for a day or two.

1389
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:35,570
It seems that all the things you
like are the best fat producers.

1390
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:40,700
You can't give them up. You notice
you don't have endurance anymore.

1391
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:44,720
You get tired after you walked a blocker
to your wind isn't as good as it used

1392
01:30:44,721 --> 01:30:48,440
to be. Remember last night, how you
puffed when you ran for the street car.

1393
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,090
Remember how you met,

1394
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:54,410
how it made you blow to carry you
that empty trunk up to the attic.

1395
01:30:55,040 --> 01:31:00,040
Your Taylor pokes you good naturedly
when he's fitting your suit and remarks

1396
01:31:00,951 --> 01:31:04,760
that the fattest piling on and
your waste is increasing by inches.

1397
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,040
These are all reasons why you should
exercise. It's not too late now.

1398
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:11,150
It's never too late.

1399
01:31:11,151 --> 01:31:15,560
As long as you are able to be around to
exercise and improve yourself physically.

1400
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:20,360
Men of all ages receive quick results
from proper physical training.

1401
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:26,260
It's never too late to make
corrections in your mode of living.

1402
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:30,920
Some classic stuff there.

1403
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:34,250
There's a little caveat there with he
says it's never too late. That's true.

1404
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,260
That's true with Samara too late,
but

1405
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:42,140
the more time that you have
spent getting into shape,

1406
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,680
you can fall out of shape
and when you come back to it,

1407
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,660
it'll be way easier. And I mentioned
this before, that's cool. You can,

1408
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:55,550
you can keep telling yourself that I am
telling you if let's say, you're right,

1409
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:58,850
you're right. You want to have a good
base. If you have a good base of being,

1410
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,010
it's going to

1411
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,850
be easier for you than somebody, somebody
that's never worked out before. Yes.

1412
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,740
That's a given.
That being said,

1413
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:09,880
if you take a person that's never
lifted before, never worked out before,

1414
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:13,210
when they start, man, they make
all kinds of crazy gains. Right.

1415
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:17,620
But keep in mind, they're still starting
at the bottom of the ladder. So yeah,

1416
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:21,010
the first, you know, 10 steps in
the ladder come quickie quickly.

1417
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,340
But that comes for everybody. Give
her to, you know, give or take.

1418
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:29,230
So sure. Okay. In the small little
picture you can be like, hey,

1419
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:33,310
that guy, he started on the first 10
steps of the ladder way later in life.

1420
01:32:33,311 --> 01:32:35,380
So look at his gains weight later in life.
But meanwhile,

1421
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:38,830
you had those first
steps done 35 years ago.

1422
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:43,480
You're on step 125 right now.
You are correct.

1423
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:48,670
The bottom line is both groups
will benefit. Oh yeah. Big Time.

1424
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,910
But physical activity. So the,
the point being, you know,

1425
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:53,680
how any mentions this host was like,
oh,

1426
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:56,020
I'll just do it tomorrow or
I'll just do it. Um, you know,

1427
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,740
the new year's resolution or whatever,
the more time you spend not doing it,

1428
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:04,810
the harder it is to get there and
stay there. Cause man, you know,

1429
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:09,070
I actually have a theory on this too.
Like if you miss a workout,

1430
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:15,040
you can never make it up. It's gone.
Like he gets it, he's like, it's gone.

1431
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,920
You can never make it because you
work out the next day. But no, no.

1432
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:20,920
You missed the day that you, you, that
was supposed to be a different workout.

1433
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:23,080
Right.
You've got weaker,

1434
01:33:23,081 --> 01:33:26,590
you can't get it back that
sometimes you need a break.

1435
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,690
I think we've got some
questions about that.

1436
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:33,010
Sometimes you definitely need a
rest to your push your body so hard.

1437
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:34,630
You're doing so much activity activity,

1438
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:39,100
but you're not going to get that chance
to work out again and you'll want,

1439
01:33:39,101 --> 01:33:41,380
you're not going to chance it anytime
you waste any time in your life,

1440
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:45,280
guess what? It's gone. Yeah. So
don't waste it. Don't waste it.

1441
01:33:45,281 --> 01:33:50,281
Don't waste it with sitting listened
to radio shows or Internet shows or

1442
01:33:50,321 --> 01:33:52,000
watching TV.
That's a waste.

1443
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:56,620
Don't waste too with that unless the
shows are helping you. Well, yeah, yes.

1444
01:33:56,621 --> 01:34:00,610
If they're helping you, if
they're beneficial, if it's
Jocko podcast, man, tune in.

1445
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:07,060
But if you're sitting
around, Oh yeah, reality TV,

1446
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:11,050
just random social media stuff that's
not helping you get any better.

1447
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:14,770
Of course you're, you're wasting it
and you're not going to get it back.

1448
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:19,480
Sometimes if I miss something or
if I am lazy about something that,

1449
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:24,460
that that pisses me off and at the
time I'll say, oh well, you know, I'll,

1450
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:27,970
I'll rationalize some excuses
around it and then later I'll say,

1451
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:31,630
what is your problem? Why did you do
that? And then it's punishment time.

1452
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:36,910
Let's go get the squat rack.
And you tell him to pay for that.

1453
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:43,540
I think, I'm going to put this real
bluntly almost to the point of ignorance,

1454
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:48,541
but I think you value rest
way less than a normal person.

1455
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:50,680
I think I,

1456
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:55,360
I'm not going to argue with you or it
could be that you value the work part of

1457
01:34:55,361 --> 01:35:00,361
it so much that your rest
is quantity wise less,

1458
01:35:00,981 --> 01:35:03,290
but quality wise might be more.

1459
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:08,750
And also like for instance,
I don't get the opportunity,

1460
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:13,550
I mean when I travel, like for Princeton,
when I travel, I barely leave recently,

1461
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:16,190
I have not had time to do
Jujitsu and I'm traveling,

1462
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,300
so when I'm back here I got
to just get it in, you know?

1463
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,210
And if I miss it when I'm in San Diego,
I'm not happy.

1464
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:26,450
I'm angry at myself and I
won't even let it happen.

1465
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:27,950
I'm just not going to let it happen.

1466
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:31,070
Even yesterday I was all tired
and beat up and I was like, okay,

1467
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:35,000
well go train all tired
and beat up because you're
going to miss some days this

1468
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:35,270
week.

1469
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:40,270
So you've got to just go get it on work
on being weak and lame and getting your,

1470
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:41,180
getting your game on.

1471
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:43,760
And I went and rolled with a bunch
of people and do what I normally do.

1472
01:35:43,761 --> 01:35:46,790
And you know what, by the time
you're in the middle of a rolling,

1473
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:50,540
it doesn't matter anymore. You're just
dealing with a situation. Yeah, man,

1474
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:54,830
if you can get to that point where you
know how you did this kind of a weird one

1475
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:59,210
where it's really good, really,
really good exercise, but it's really,

1476
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:02,450
really fun to do. Yeah. So it's
like a win win you don't like.

1477
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,610
So weightlifting I think is like that,

1478
01:36:04,611 --> 01:36:07,760
but it's not like that for everybody
where it's like it's fun to actually do,

1479
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:10,070
even though sometimes you got to
kind of build up the, you know,

1480
01:36:10,071 --> 01:36:15,020
kind of the energy or whatever to, you
know, motivation, whatever to do it.

1481
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,950
It's still pretty fun.
But for most people I would,

1482
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:22,900
I would argue most people exercises like
work, it's like a chore, the benefit.

1483
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:26,330
And I think the more you do it and
the better you get at it. Yeah.

1484
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:30,440
Either more fun. It is,
the more you enjoy it.

1485
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:35,120
For me it's a mental break. You know,
it's a mental break from everything else.

1486
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:37,340
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm going to go pick up this,

1487
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,810
this piece of metal off the ground.
Lunchtime bunch of times. Yeah. And,

1488
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,220
and the point there is,

1489
01:36:43,221 --> 01:36:48,221
if you can get to that state
where actually doing the
exercise separate from the

1490
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:53,660
results actually doing
it is, is fun. You can,

1491
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:57,690
you can recognize the pleasure in it.
Um,

1492
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,980
that's when you can be on a program.
You know how,

1493
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:05,630
like I just got back from quiet
little like a vacation, but I still,

1494
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:09,410
I still rolled, I still,
uh, did, you know,

1495
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:13,370
lifted weights and exercise
great. Train with went so, um,

1496
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:17,260
before, and I think most people,
it's when it's vacation time,

1497
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:18,110
they're off the program.

1498
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:21,320
And I'm not even saying I'm
in specifically on a program,

1499
01:37:21,321 --> 01:37:26,030
but it's just too hard on the life
program on the deal men. So if you,

1500
01:37:26,031 --> 01:37:27,920
if you're into it, you know, like, oh,

1501
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:30,350
I look forward to going
and training at a new spot.

1502
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,600
This is a lot of fun to be had there.
There's a lot of fun to be,

1503
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:34,400
I'm going to trade the,
the normal spot.

1504
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:39,740
But if you're in that mindset where you
liked the exercise that you're doing,

1505
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,290
but you'll do it, you go on
vacation, you'll do it then. Yeah.

1506
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,350
Looking forward to it.
Yeah. There's no doubt.

1507
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:50,300
So you don't fall off having fun
when you train as is and enjoying it.

1508
01:37:50,301 --> 01:37:54,260
I guess having fun cause it's not like
when I'm in the middle of the set of

1509
01:37:54,261 --> 01:37:59,010
clean and jerks, I'm having fun. But
that's kind of what it mean though.

1510
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:02,160
Where, um, I remember when I
used to play football we'd,

1511
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:06,870
we'd test in Olympic lifting. So like
power clean was one and snatch was one.

1512
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,390
And I remember training for those things.

1513
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:13,110
If you get kind of good at the technique,
right? Comes Fun with your friends,

1514
01:38:13,111 --> 01:38:15,300
they're yelling and stuff like that.
So it's fun.

1515
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:20,390
I guess I was thinking more of like a
met cons when you're all wanting a good

1516
01:38:20,971 --> 01:38:24,090
example,
be just being frank with you.

1517
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:29,700
I'm not always having fun during those.
Sometimes I want to not do it. Yeah.

1518
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:32,460
And I still do it, but I don't
want to, it's just not fun.

1519
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:33,800
I would say more times than not,

1520
01:38:33,801 --> 01:38:36,150
especially any kind of met constitution
that's going to be the case.

1521
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:41,151
So my overall point is if you can get to
that point where at the very least you

1522
01:38:42,961 --> 01:38:45,750
can appreciate this. That's
happening right now. I like,

1523
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:50,220
I find you some pleasure in here.
And furthermore,

1524
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:51,480
I will tell you this,

1525
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:56,540
if you get to know the feeling of how you
feel when you complete a hard workout,

1526
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:00,510
you go, you know what?
It's going to be worth it.

1527
01:39:00,511 --> 01:39:03,900
Because when I get done with this,
I'm going to feel like x, right?

1528
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:08,070
I'm going to feel good. And so
that for me, that's why I'm,

1529
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:11,040
I think that's kind of why I'm doing
hard workouts because I'm doing hard

1530
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:13,590
workouts because I know that at the
end of it I'm going to be like, yeah,

1531
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:14,770
I feel I'm going to feel good.
Yeah,

1532
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,520
I'm going to feel fired up
for the rest of the day.

1533
01:39:17,521 --> 01:39:20,980
I'm going to feel like I did something.
Well.

1534
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:23,040
I'm going to feel like
a quality human being.

1535
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:28,041
Like I didn't waste a little section
section of my life full feel good.

1536
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,820
Yeah.
So when you know what that,

1537
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:35,050
it's the same thing with waking up in
the morning when you sleep in that that

1538
01:39:35,101 --> 01:39:38,790
feels good at the moment. But then
when you wake up you're like, oh man,

1539
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:44,010
I just wasted part of my life. Whereas
when you get up, even though it's hard,

1540
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:48,250
when you know how good it feels to be
done with your workout that early in the

1541
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:51,000
morning and be like, yeah, I'm ready.
You bring it, bring on the tasks.

1542
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:56,420
And it's strange thing about
workout is the workout pays you,

1543
01:39:57,870 --> 01:40:02,070
pays you back for your work afterwards.

1544
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,050
It's basically a,
you know,

1545
01:40:04,051 --> 01:40:07,710
you work out in the workout isn't
what makes your muscles big.

1546
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:11,430
It's the response to the workout.
So when you work out,

1547
01:40:11,431 --> 01:40:14,100
it's Kinda like you did your part and
now your body is going to pay you back

1548
01:40:14,101 --> 01:40:17,880
with your gains, you know? True. So you're
like, Hey, I'm done with the workout.

1549
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:22,380
I can go do some other stuff. Meanwhile I
got that check coming, that gains check.

1550
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:27,310
That's a good daily. So
yeah, that's awesome.

1551
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:33,690
And now I think it's about time
we go to the interwebs. Sure.

1552
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:39,200
But first you can actually support
the podcast through the interwebs.

1553
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:45,420
Echo. We do it well. Let the troopers, no,

1554
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:47,330
one of the ways,
um,

1555
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:52,110
which may sound repetitive but
necessarily so in my opinion,

1556
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:54,280
it.com/jocko

1557
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:59,920
cause some people they want to improve
their improvement with supplements and we

1558
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:03,880
recommend all we, I recommend supplements
that work. I'm assuming you do too.

1559
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:08,990
I actually do. Yeah, there you go.
So you get them from Onnit. Yup.

1560
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:12,460
On att.com/jocko shroom tech.

1561
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:17,920
These are the ones I take or have taken.
Shroom tech,

1562
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:22,980
Alpha Brain Krill

1563
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,290
oil from me. Yeah. We're addicts.

1564
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:30,790
Their audit out of Krill oil
right now as a tailwind. Yeah.

1565
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:32,780
There'll be plenty of Krill.
Just keep,

1566
01:41:32,781 --> 01:41:36,920
keep your finger on the pulse of the
Krill oil situation and then the um,

1567
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:41,480
or your bar boom. That one's good. That's
an it. Is that a supplement, do you think?

1568
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:44,230
Would you call this food that's tasty?
Yeah.

1569
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:49,310
On it.com/jocko get 10%
off all supplements.

1570
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:54,650
It's dope.
Also if you like the shirts that we make,

1571
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,530
go to [inaudible] dot com and get
one or more of that of those. Um,

1572
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:02,210
and then, uh, yeah, that's a
good way to support I think.

1573
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:04,753
And then

1574
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:11,600
before you do your Amazon shop shopping,
clickthrough Jocko,

1575
01:42:11,601 --> 01:42:14,990
podcast.com, there's like, there's
a little link on there. Um,

1576
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:18,440
and then Jocko stories while this
Amazon Linkedin, click there first,

1577
01:42:18,441 --> 01:42:22,570
then do the shopping. Um, also on the
Jocko podcast website, we have all,

1578
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:26,990
I put all the books that you cover on
all these podcasts so you can see what

1579
01:42:26,991 --> 01:42:29,540
they're about. Click on it if you
want to get one of those books

1580
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:32,660
and then,

1581
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,560
okay.

1582
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:39,220
audible.com audible is just the
way to listen to audio books.

1583
01:42:39,221 --> 01:42:43,300
So what they're doing is they're
giving you 30 days free 30.

1584
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:49,210
Um, if you go to audible.com/jocko so
you get 30 days free and then you get to

1585
01:42:49,211 --> 01:42:50,440
download a free book.

1586
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:55,580
But once you, did they download?
Do you think, would you recommend,

1587
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:59,420
I think my recommendation would clearly
be a little book by Jocko Willink and

1588
01:42:59,421 --> 01:43:04,070
Leif Babin called extreme ownership.
We actually read the audio book too.

1589
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,900
So if you like the Jocko podcast,

1590
01:43:05,901 --> 01:43:08,960
you're probably going to like here
in the extreme ownership read bios.

1591
01:43:08,961 --> 01:43:13,130
It's about eight hours long.
So it's like getting four podcasts,

1592
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,100
maybe even five podcasts.
But yeah, you know,

1593
01:43:16,101 --> 01:43:21,101
we've gotten some really because of the
support people of showing the podcast

1594
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,510
and it's becoming more popular.

1595
01:43:23,511 --> 01:43:27,230
We been getting hammered by a bunch of
people that want to sponsor us and we

1596
01:43:27,231 --> 01:43:30,830
don't want a bunch of sponsors.
In fact, we don't want any.

1597
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:34,730
The only thing we want is if
there's things that can help people,

1598
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:40,040
help people get better, well
then that's what we want. So on,

1599
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:44,120
it gives you the supplements that you
need, some of the gear that you need.

1600
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:46,760
And then on top of that
you've got all the bowl,

1601
01:43:46,761 --> 01:43:50,990
which is a way to listen to books while
you can't have the ability to read.

1602
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:53,720
So if you're driving,
if you're doing yard work,

1603
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:58,040
if you're doing some something that
requires your hands and your eyes,

1604
01:43:58,070 --> 01:44:03,070
you can just listen to a
book on audible.com/jocko
and so that's a another way

1605
01:44:04,731 --> 01:44:09,080
to also then thereby support the podcast.
30 days free book.

1606
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:11,720
Do it get smarter.

1607
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:15,370
I recommend the extreme ownership as well.

1608
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:19,930
It's interesting that you guys read it
cause that's not always the case, right?

1609
01:44:19,931 --> 01:44:23,340
Sometimes it's, it's like a
professional reader or whatever. But um,

1610
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:26,380
like if you know what leafs voice
sounds like, sounds like Batman.

1611
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:31,300
He does have bad anyway.
There it is. Yes, indeed.

1612
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:37,090
So yeah, there you go. Let's get to
the question of questions. I'm down.

1613
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:42,060
All right.
First Question Jocko,

1614
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:47,060
do you ever feel burnt out from going
full tilt several days or several weeks in

1615
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:49,590
a row? And if so, what do you do?

1616
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:54,300
Never. No, of course. Um,

1617
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:57,090
you know,
burning the candle at both ends.

1618
01:44:57,150 --> 01:45:01,080
Eventually it's gonna catch up with you.
And for me,

1619
01:45:01,081 --> 01:45:05,940
it's can come in the form of too
much travel, too much exercise.

1620
01:45:06,990 --> 01:45:09,150
Sometimes I'll just be pressed at work,

1621
01:45:09,151 --> 01:45:10,890
working with a bunch
of different companies.

1622
01:45:11,610 --> 01:45:14,460
Sometimes I'm writing and I'm trying
to get a bunch of writing done.

1623
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:18,540
Sometimes I'm training so much
Jujitsu it's going crazy. So anyways,

1624
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:21,960
or a lot of times it's the combination
of all these things going on at once

1625
01:45:21,961 --> 01:45:25,770
cause I'm trying to get a bunch done
in a short amount of time and I end up

1626
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:29,220
whatever coming off the common
off the track a little bit,

1627
01:45:29,221 --> 01:45:33,780
coming off the rails a little bit and so
what do I do on those kind of days when

1628
01:45:33,781 --> 01:45:35,850
I'm starting to feel like
that? Well, number one,

1629
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:40,830
I like to force myself to do it anyways.
That is a reality.

1630
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:46,020
So if even if I'm, if I don't feel like
working out, I'll be like, you know what,

1631
01:45:46,021 --> 01:45:50,190
just go do a quick workout and easy and
easy or workout or I don't want to train

1632
01:45:50,191 --> 01:45:51,780
Jujitsu.
We were talking about this earlier.

1633
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:55,890
Don't really feel like training
going to go train anyways.

1634
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:00,480
Then maybe there's some form of
work that I'm supposed to do.

1635
01:46:00,481 --> 01:46:01,950
I'm just going to go
and do the work anyways.

1636
01:46:01,951 --> 01:46:06,951
Now if if the next day I still
feel like I need a break,

1637
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,620
that's sort of my red flag
to say, all right, you know
what? You need a break. Uh,

1638
01:46:12,621 --> 01:46:16,830
you need to take some time, time, relax.

1639
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:20,730
Um,
do some kind of active rest.

1640
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:23,340
I don't really like just
kind of sitting around.

1641
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:29,060
I'll do something kind of active
and probably eat some steaks,

1642
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:34,950
plural, trying to eat something really
good, trying to eat some just, you know,

1643
01:46:34,951 --> 01:46:35,784
I might,

1644
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:40,820
I might eat something really
good like steaks and maybe sleep,

1645
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:45,780
take an extra nap,
try and feel better,

1646
01:46:45,781 --> 01:46:50,100
do some kind of stretching to try and
feel better just to recover, just recover.

1647
01:46:50,101 --> 01:46:54,900
So yes, I'm not super human like anybody
else. Sometimes it get broken down,

1648
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:59,970
beaten up and I need some downtime and
that's what I do. I try and rest, relax

1649
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:02,080
and eat some good food.
Yeah,

1650
01:47:02,081 --> 01:47:04,720
that's a good one that I started to
incorporate how you were seeing. Um,

1651
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:09,120
if I don't feel like it or if I feel like
I'm starting to get burnt out, you'll,

1652
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:13,810
you'll, it's like that one last
thing. Let me just do it anyway.

1653
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,000
Then I'll see if I do it.
You know,

1654
01:47:16,001 --> 01:47:19,990
because sometimes like how you say you
avoid the situation where you just not in

1655
01:47:19,991 --> 01:47:22,120
the mood. If you're in some
days you just not in the mood,

1656
01:47:22,121 --> 01:47:23,260
but it doesn't mean you're burnt out,

1657
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:25,300
you're just not in the
mood for whatever reason.

1658
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:30,340
So that's a good way to kind of weed
those days out. And um, and yeah,

1659
01:47:30,341 --> 01:47:33,340
if you're still burnt out the next
day or even the next day after that,

1660
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:35,330
then it's like, okay,
you gotta arrest. Um,

1661
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:38,350
I started doing that and
you'd be surprised what it,

1662
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:43,000
how many times you really not burnt out.
You're just not in the mood that's a B

1663
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:49,300
do, you might not agree with
this, but if you are like,

1664
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:53,050
whether it be burnt out or just tired
of, uh, you know, you're, you're just,

1665
01:47:53,051 --> 01:47:56,620
you're just tired of the grind or whatever
and you need a break or vacation or

1666
01:47:56,621 --> 01:47:58,750
whatever.
What I saw,

1667
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:03,190
what I sometimes do is

1668
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:07,660
don't do like filming for example,

1669
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:12,040
where there would be times where I would
spend like months just filming every

1670
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:12,350
week fill.

1671
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:17,350
I didn't feel like no break and what I
do is don't do any of it and don't think

1672
01:48:18,251 --> 01:48:21,010
about it,
don't just don't do it at all.

1673
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,250
And then slowly and I,
in my experience,

1674
01:48:24,251 --> 01:48:26,250
I was surprised how quick
it came back where you,

1675
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,820
you kind of want to get back to it,

1676
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:33,100
but then I go like like a week or
still not doing it. It's like Jujitsu.

1677
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,320
If you're like, Oh man, I'm tired
to training every day or whatever,

1678
01:48:35,321 --> 01:48:37,260
you had to turn them in or
whatever and you're like, man,

1679
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:41,170
I got to take a break after
about probably like three days.

1680
01:48:41,171 --> 01:48:42,880
If you're a competitor three
days where you're like, man,

1681
01:48:42,881 --> 01:48:46,780
I want to get back on the mats.
So what you do is you push that even more.

1682
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:51,610
So it's like you're, you're pushing
yourself to be burnt out on the recovery.

1683
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:52,833
So the only,

1684
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:57,430
the only medicine for that burnt out
of recovery is to get back into it.

1685
01:48:57,431 --> 01:49:01,060
But that hunger of getting back into it
is even more than it normally would be.

1686
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:04,370
Normal break. That makes sense. I guess.

1687
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:09,430
And I just want to call us in both out
right now for being total cream puffs,

1688
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:10,790
I think is what Bob often said.

1689
01:49:10,791 --> 01:49:15,590
Here we are talking about how we get
burnt out on working out training,

1690
01:49:15,591 --> 01:49:19,640
filming. It's like Bob,
Bob Hoffman was, you know,

1691
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:24,940
living in the seeds of
mustard gas floating around
and maybe we should just say

1692
01:49:26,930 --> 01:49:31,870
don't get burnout. Just
work harder. Sorry.

1693
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:36,860
You maybe thought a real bad they're
filming. No, I mean I was like, oh,

1694
01:49:36,861 --> 01:49:40,460
I was typing on a computer on
real burnt out. Shut up Jocko.

1695
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:42,200
I've got a better idea.

1696
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:46,160
Why don't you just be fired up that you
have the opportunity to create something?

1697
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:47,520
How's that sound?
Oh,

1698
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:52,270
you got the opportunity to go train
Jujitsu to go get better physically. Oh,

1699
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:53,860
I think I'm going to go ahead and do that.

1700
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:58,240
I'm not going to sit there and say
burnout out on training. No, no, no.

1701
01:49:58,241 --> 01:50:03,100
Be burnout if Bob Hoffman is not burned
out on the front lines of World War One.

1702
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:07,600
I don't think we have an excuse to be
burnout on the pleasurable things we get

1703
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:11,860
to do in life, but suck it up and
just drive on. I'm changing my answer.

1704
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:19,420
There you go.
Next question Jocko.

1705
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:24,300
Hi Guys. How about judo as a
martial art compared to Jujitsu?

1706
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:32,460
Judo is a great martial art and Jujitsu
is actually rooted in judo and I guess

1707
01:50:33,641 --> 01:50:38,641
originally judo was rooted in Jujitsu
and there are some connections or I mean

1708
01:50:39,041 --> 01:50:41,740
my eda from Japan.

1709
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:46,770
He taught judo to Carlos Gracie in Brazil
which was then learned by alien Gracie

1710
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:53,041
who then morphed it into what we consider
now to be Brazilian or Gracie Jujitsu.

1711
01:50:56,020 --> 01:51:01,020
But you can see clearly if you look
at judo that Jujitsu exists inside.

1712
01:51:02,591 --> 01:51:06,910
I mean Brazilian Jiu Jitsu exist inside
of judo. There's no doubt about it,

1713
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:12,120
but there are some things about judo
that have morphed it into a different

1714
01:51:12,251 --> 01:51:14,170
direction. Number one, in judo,

1715
01:51:14,171 --> 01:51:18,070
if you throw somebody and anything
touches the ground before their feet,

1716
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:21,400
you went automatically.
You can also pin people in judo.

1717
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:23,740
If you hold them down for,
I think it's 20 seconds,

1718
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:27,070
then the match is over
and you win both of those.

1719
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:31,690
So what that does is now you can imagine
if you get thrown, okay, you win.

1720
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:35,350
If you're on the ground with your
back down for 20 seconds, you win.

1721
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:40,480
So what does that do? It eliminates a
part of fighting that is very important.

1722
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:45,370
And in there are really
two pieces of judo.

1723
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:48,640
One of them is called Randori,

1724
01:51:48,641 --> 01:51:52,720
which is basically rolling and the other
one is Newaza, which is ground work.

1725
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:58,150
And those two are directly
correlated or part of Jujitsu.

1726
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:02,500
But jujitsu bottom line in both these,

1727
01:52:02,501 --> 01:52:04,240
if you don't know
anything about these two,

1728
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:08,230
Jujitsu allows the fight to go
on even after you get thrown.

1729
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:11,710
And it allows the fight. You can't,
there's no pinning in Jujitsu.

1730
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:15,460
You are allowed to fight and continue
to fight until the match is over.

1731
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:21,130
And you can recover from being pinned
just like you can recover from being

1732
01:52:21,131 --> 01:52:23,650
frozen. And it doesn't
really matter. I mean,

1733
01:52:23,651 --> 01:52:26,980
today we were training today and we got
some good judo players. Keeling was,

1734
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:31,270
you know, judo keeling.
Yeah. And he, he tossed,

1735
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:36,710
he tossed Andy Big Andy and I mean cause
he's better at judo and he tossed him

1736
01:52:36,941 --> 01:52:37,774
and it was legit.

1737
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:41,470
Then Andy ended up getting out of that
position and getting in a better position.

1738
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:46,190
Right. And so the fight wasn't over
just cause he got right. And so that's,

1739
01:52:46,191 --> 01:52:51,191
that's one of the big benefits of Jujitsu
is that you will generally learned

1740
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:54,380
better ground game

1741
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,900
and but judo you will definitely
have better takedowns.

1742
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:02,120
I mean a judo player is going to have
better take downs that a Jujitsu player

1743
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:05,180
and I'll tell you if we're just
going to start ranking things,

1744
01:53:05,181 --> 01:53:09,470
you've got to throw wrestling out there
because wrestling has possibly better

1745
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:14,420
take downs. The judo, I mean
with the geese. Sure. Judo
has a, it has an advantage.

1746
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,590
But if you don't know this,

1747
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:20,770
in 2010 they actually banned the double
leg take down from judo competitions in

1748
01:53:21,441 --> 01:53:22,850
the whole world. Right? Why?

1749
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:26,600
Because wrestlers came in and started
double leg in people. Boom, boom.

1750
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:30,500
Just hitting double legs.
So yes,

1751
01:53:30,501 --> 01:53:34,070
I would say judo is an
awesome martial art.

1752
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:39,130
It really in some ways could be considered
the precursor to Brazilian Jujitsu,

1753
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,350
even though judo itself is,

1754
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:45,560
comes from actual Japanese Jujitsu.

1755
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:48,680
But I would say if you're going to,

1756
01:53:48,681 --> 01:53:52,190
if you've got the opportunity to learn in
judo, yeah, learn it, learn especially,

1757
01:53:52,191 --> 01:53:52,371
you know,

1758
01:53:52,371 --> 01:53:55,730
you'll learn the takedowns and those
are great things to have in real life.

1759
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:58,880
They're great things to have in,
in self defense situations.

1760
01:53:58,881 --> 01:54:00,920
To be able to take someone down
with judo throws is awesome.

1761
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:04,460
In jujitsu competitions, if you're a
judo player in Jujitsu competitions,

1762
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:05,390
you're going to,

1763
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:07,800
you're going to get the take down
with when it's a key competence,

1764
01:54:07,801 --> 01:54:09,740
unless you're going against
a really good wrestler.

1765
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:13,700
So good thing to augment Jujitsu with.

1766
01:54:13,701 --> 01:54:17,090
But I would say you would want
to make Jujitsu your main focus.

1767
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:20,750
I agree that,
yeah.

1768
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:26,150
So a lot of times when you learn, did you
to some, a lot of, especially nowadays,

1769
01:54:26,151 --> 01:54:28,820
a lot of guys avoid that.
The takedown LMS.

1770
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,660
So they know ground game is just vast,
but the takedown elements.

1771
01:54:32,661 --> 01:54:34,340
So you'll get a lot of
people pulling garden,

1772
01:54:34,341 --> 01:54:37,420
which just means pulling a guy down
on top of you. That's what filling,

1773
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:41,210
which is a crazy thing to do in
a real fight. Yeah. But, but man,

1774
01:54:41,211 --> 01:54:45,500
if you're good for sure you can totally
do that. That's what's crazy about it.

1775
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:46,630
No,

1776
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:47,890
even if you're really good at it,

1777
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:49,980
you don't want to be pulling
people on top of you.

1778
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:53,080
I did compare it to it and being able to
take them down compared to being on the

1779
01:54:53,081 --> 01:54:56,680
side of no brainer. Yeah. Not
even close. So what I like about,

1780
01:54:56,681 --> 01:55:00,220
I mean wrestling I think is more,
I mean arguably more,

1781
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:02,260
more dynamic of,

1782
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,760
of a thing because it's all
these different situations
even on top of just the

1783
01:55:06,761 --> 01:55:09,220
takedown part. But man, judo,

1784
01:55:09,221 --> 01:55:14,221
I feel like it takes a little less
energy and it can kind of keep you in.

1785
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:18,820
Positionally can keep you in safe areas
when you're standing up. Cause you know,

1786
01:55:18,821 --> 01:55:22,830
like these weird positions where you're
on balance in that guys off balance or

1787
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:26,800
you, you're controlling the guys
wait when you're standing up. And um,

1788
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,680
so I learned like a signal.

1789
01:55:28,681 --> 01:55:32,040
I took judo when I was young for just
for a little bit and then I never would

1790
01:55:32,041 --> 01:55:36,280
have guessed that for a little bit anyway.

1791
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:41,800
And then, but as an adult I
learned a little bit of judo,

1792
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:47,070
um, from, from Terry. So could you see
of the judo background? Um, and man,

1793
01:55:47,071 --> 01:55:49,740
he was showing me stuff. He was
like, Hey, wrestlers will do this.

1794
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:53,610
And he'd kind of show or they grab
your head, neck and, and he's like,

1795
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:56,270
and here's what you do as a judo guy guy.
And he,

1796
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,620
it's an elaborate thing he
taught me, but it's like, Dang,

1797
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:02,610
these are real useful things for Jujitsu.

1798
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:06,990
Even aside from the take down part of it
and then going to the take down part of

1799
01:56:06,991 --> 01:56:08,820
it.
If you know the takedowns solid,

1800
01:56:08,821 --> 01:56:11,830
even if you don't like three or four
really good ones and you're really good at

1801
01:56:11,831 --> 01:56:16,530
them, that'll change your whole approach
and your whole outlook on Jujitsu. So,

1802
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:19,170
okay, here's an example. Let's
say you go into, I dunno,

1803
01:56:19,171 --> 01:56:23,970
you know party here everyday thing where
you could find yourself in a situation

1804
01:56:23,971 --> 01:56:24,630
where you got to,

1805
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:27,300
you got to get in a fight or defend
yourself or your friend or whatever.

1806
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:30,180
If you know take downs,

1807
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,500
especially take downs where you don't
have to like risk like doing the double

1808
01:56:34,501 --> 01:56:38,310
leg in a real situation. That's kind of
an all or nothing situation. You know,

1809
01:56:38,311 --> 01:56:39,001
you can't just,

1810
01:56:39,001 --> 01:56:43,900
it's not like this gradual escalating
of force with a double leg take down.

1811
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:46,840
With judo it's different,

1812
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:50,460
much more subtle with your takedowns
with varying levels of force,

1813
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:55,050
you know with the, with the
judo situation. So if, and
if you're good at that, men,

1814
01:56:55,051 --> 01:56:58,440
when you get into these situations,
it's like no factor.

1815
01:56:58,441 --> 01:57:02,010
You not worried about it at all
compared to like you don't know,

1816
01:57:02,011 --> 01:57:04,440
take putting your Jujitsu
is sick. You're like, Nah,

1817
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:07,530
I got to get this thing to the ground and
it's like that's going to be a pain in

1818
01:57:07,531 --> 01:57:08,850
the ass once we get there,
I'm fine.

1819
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:13,560
But just that one little crossover
from standing or no fight to fight.

1820
01:57:13,561 --> 01:57:16,620
It's like they kind of can
provide some anxiety for you.

1821
01:57:16,621 --> 01:57:19,480
But if you know that
doodle, whatever. Yep.

1822
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:23,480
The, I guess the overall point is
learned that judo very useful not right.

1823
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:27,120
And that's not to mention when the other
guy knows it, you know what to do to.

1824
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:31,950
Yeah, because otherwise I'm just getting
tossed keeling, toss me the other guy.

1825
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:33,490
Oh yeah.

1826
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:37,960
And sometimes it can be funny and fun
cause you know they can toss to you and

1827
01:57:37,961 --> 01:57:40,630
you landed on your back and stuff like
that with Manson, you land on your head.

1828
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:41,740
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1829
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:46,540
There is some validity to the a pawn in
that if you were in a street fight and

1830
01:57:46,541 --> 01:57:49,870
you got thrown and land and the
person puts you down in a bad way,

1831
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,210
I mean you're still, it's, it's like,

1832
01:57:52,270 --> 01:57:54,760
it's not like you're going to
get knocked out 100% of the time.

1833
01:57:54,761 --> 01:57:56,860
Probably not even 50% of the time,
but there is a,

1834
01:57:56,861 --> 01:58:01,720
there is a chance that getting thrown it
palm style in a street fight could be,

1835
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:02,081
I mean,

1836
01:58:02,081 --> 01:58:06,010
you go go pull up some judo videos of
people getting tossed it bone style.

1837
01:58:06,011 --> 01:58:10,180
Even in the, in the high levels. Some of
those guys, if they landed on the street,

1838
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:13,450
they would be injured not all the time.
And you do learn to,

1839
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:18,120
you learn to fall in judo, you learn
how to break your fall. But yeah,

1840
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:21,080
some of those would be devastating
if they happen to you in the street.

1841
01:58:21,081 --> 01:58:23,680
So that's why iPhone does
have some validity to it,

1842
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:28,090
that if you tossed someone super hard
and they landed on their back or on their

1843
01:58:28,091 --> 01:58:32,970
head on the street on concrete, they
would be severe. They would be that.

1844
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:36,770
It could be a fight ender, but,
but it's not going to be a fighter.

1845
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,430
That's the problem.
It's not going to be a fight ender.

1846
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:41,980
It's possible that it is a just like,

1847
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,850
uh,
a left hook is possibly a fight ender,

1848
01:58:45,851 --> 01:58:47,490
but it's not guaranteed Dan to fight.

1849
01:58:47,910 --> 01:58:52,560
I'll tell you a guaranteed fight, ender
rear naked choke. Willing to fight. Yeah.

1850
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:57,660
And if I'll tell you in knowing some judo
and especially knowing some judo moves

1851
01:58:57,661 --> 01:58:59,280
that I feel like I'm pretty solid at.

1852
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:02,820
If you do it against the guy who doesn't
really know that much judo. Oh yeah.

1853
01:59:02,821 --> 01:59:05,790
It's your choice whether you want
to put them on his head or his back.

1854
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:06,920
It's your choice.
So if,

1855
01:59:06,921 --> 01:59:09,750
if that's the other guys' choice that
you're fighting with or competing against

1856
01:59:09,751 --> 01:59:12,300
or whatever, then that's
his choice, not yours.

1857
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:15,150
So that's the reason to at least know.

1858
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:19,900
Yeah, for sure. You should
know for sure. I learned judo,

1859
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:24,570
learn wrestling,
learn Jujitsu.

1860
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,720
Jujitsu is the most complicated. Learn
it first. Spend the most time on it.

1861
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:33,780
Learning to strike to more Thai boxing,
saying this for the millions of times.

1862
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:40,480
Although I actually do sometimes leave
judo out, not intentionally, but just,

1863
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:41,670
I just do.
Yeah.

1864
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:48,030
I personally liked wrestling.
I like it personally.

1865
01:59:48,031 --> 01:59:52,800
I like it better than wrestling because
when I was started to learn wrestling

1866
01:59:52,801 --> 01:59:56,580
with them, Greg, Greg, train
on you. Come and get you.

1867
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:00,480
Why tell him this too. But this,
I'm not saying I dislike wrestling,

1868
02:00:00,481 --> 02:00:03,480
I'm just saying I like judo
better because like I said,

1869
02:00:03,481 --> 02:00:08,460
when you shoot a double or a single or
something and he stuffs it in a bet,

1870
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:11,520
a worse situation than if
you go for, you know, some,

1871
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:15,450
you know saying doggy or something and
you don't get, well he's on your back.

1872
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:18,240
But you know what I mean
though, it failed. Judo throw,

1873
02:00:18,241 --> 02:00:21,030
you have way less of a
price to pay typically.

1874
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:26,070
Do you usually have less of a price to
pay on a judo throw than you do in a

1875
02:00:26,071 --> 02:00:30,810
wrestling, takedown understanding verse?
It depends, but yes, generally speaking,

1876
02:00:30,811 --> 02:00:32,310
in my experience,
that's why

1877
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:35,820
I'll,
I'll give that to you with like a,

1878
02:00:35,910 --> 02:00:39,360
like a small percentage of
agreement that not a full, yeah,

1879
02:00:39,361 --> 02:00:43,050
I mean it's not that black and white
for sure. That's Greco guys, Greco,

1880
02:00:43,051 --> 02:00:47,910
Roman Russell. Now they're not
shooting on you anymore and believe me,

1881
02:00:47,911 --> 02:00:50,760
you're getting tossed. You know,
you train with a good Greco guy.

1882
02:00:50,850 --> 02:00:53,040
They're not grabbing your legs at all.
They're not even shooting,

1883
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:57,720
but they are throwing you right. And
they don't have to grab the Gita do it.

1884
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:00,240
So Greco Greco Greco was awesome.

1885
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:03,730
Yeah, I agree. Um, and
then also the judo thing,

1886
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:08,830
it tends to, in my experience, um,

1887
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:10,810
take less out of you.

1888
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:13,740
You know, it's, it's a less,

1889
02:01:14,130 --> 02:01:18,610
it's somewhere in between Jujitsu
and wrestling is the exertion. Yeah.

1890
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:23,340
Jeffery phone, black and
white. A lot of generalities.

1891
02:01:23,341 --> 02:01:28,341
Please don't go crazy because of
some generalities that echo made

1892
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:35,040
quick. Wait, are we good there?
Do you have any more to add?

1893
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:38,830
I have nothing further to add. Alright.
Keep training everything you can. Yeah,

1894
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:40,160
I liked the judo.
Thumbs

1895
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,950
up for the Judah though, for
sure. Question number three.

1896
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:48,050
What's your recommendation for
an employee that is late to work?

1897
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,860
Who usually is late but they're
usually a good performer.

1898
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,520
So being late is unacceptable.

1899
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:02,673
And I,

1900
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:05,800
I tell us when I've right
pork with a company and they
start talking about, well,

1901
02:02:05,801 --> 02:02:07,540
you know,
this guy is late for a meeting sometimes.

1902
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:11,860
I always tell him that I was in the
military for 20 years and I was literally

1903
02:02:11,861 --> 02:02:15,310
never late. I was literally
never late one time. Yeah.

1904
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:20,290
We'll think about that 20 years.
Never late, never late, never late.

1905
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:24,880
Any time for anything we would,
you know,

1906
02:02:24,881 --> 02:02:28,630
we would show up at work in the morning
so early that even if the worst case

1907
02:02:28,631 --> 02:02:32,470
scenario, my, I got t
boned on the way to work,

1908
02:02:32,471 --> 02:02:35,620
I would still be able to get insurance,
get everything covered,

1909
02:02:35,621 --> 02:02:38,000
get a cab and still show
up and be an hour early.

1910
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:42,550
So you should be,

1911
02:02:42,551 --> 02:02:46,780
you're right in the fact that being on
time is definitely very, very important.

1912
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:49,390
So people shouldn't be late.

1913
02:02:49,391 --> 02:02:52,990
So now with this individual got someone
that's showing up late for work,

1914
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:55,390
you got it.
Like any other leadership challenge,

1915
02:02:55,600 --> 02:03:00,600
what I would attack is making
sure they understand why.

1916
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:03,490
Why is it important?

1917
02:03:03,491 --> 02:03:08,491
Some people never make the connection
as to why being on time is important.

1918
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:13,510
So you got to explain to
them why it's important.

1919
02:03:13,511 --> 02:03:17,800
You got to explain to them that's
basic respect for other people's time.

1920
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:23,460
That it's basic operational readiness
is to follow a timeline that it's about

1921
02:03:24,251 --> 02:03:25,480
being prepared,

1922
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:30,481
that it's about showing your reliability
and your professionalism to two other

1923
02:03:31,541 --> 02:03:34,600
people that you're working with
inside and outside of your company.

1924
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:36,590
Yeah.

1925
02:03:36,590 --> 02:03:39,140
And even Sun Su

1926
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:43,790
sewn too. And I, I didn't
say this during the,

1927
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:47,510
during the podcast that
we did about Sun Su,

1928
02:03:48,530 --> 02:03:52,040
and I can't believe I didn't say it
because I always believe in luck.

1929
02:03:52,041 --> 02:03:56,570
Waking up early and being early and Sun
Tzu said that he who is waiting on the

1930
02:03:56,571 --> 02:04:01,571
battlefield is gonna win and who he was
rushing late to the battlefield is gonna

1931
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:04,430
lose. Well, that's the
way your life is too.

1932
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:08,300
And if you're rushing and you things are
disorganized and you're running late,

1933
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:09,830
it's horrible.

1934
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:15,470
But if you wake up early and you show
up early and you're ready and you're

1935
02:04:15,471 --> 02:04:17,750
prepared and you're waiting on the
battlefield, you're going to win.

1936
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:18,860
That's all there is to it.

1937
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:24,160
So those are the important things that
you have to explain to your employee that

1938
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:24,861
they,

1939
02:04:24,861 --> 02:04:29,861
so that they understand why being late
is an unacceptable and why being on time

1940
02:04:30,381 --> 02:04:34,490
is the standard that needs to
be maintained. Some people,

1941
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:38,220
it's a horrible habit that some
people have of being, wait,

1942
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:43,250
it's a horrible habit. Yeah. You
don't want to get into it. It just,

1943
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:46,600
just unreliability. Yeah. Um, I,

1944
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:48,450
it was one of those people,

1945
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:52,450
I used to work in the nightclub in here,

1946
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:56,700
San Diego downtown for awhile too,
from like seven years.

1947
02:04:57,090 --> 02:05:01,070
And unlike you, I feel like, I
feel like, I don't know, I don't,

1948
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:02,670
I didn't engage it or another count them,

1949
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:07,230
but it feels like I was late at the
very least one minute late, you know,

1950
02:05:07,231 --> 02:05:09,270
you have a shift, right. And
it starts at whatever time,

1951
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:14,310
either one minute late or 10 minutes late,
I feel like I was more late,

1952
02:05:14,311 --> 02:05:16,840
more times than I was on
time. I feel like. Right.

1953
02:05:16,870 --> 02:05:19,710
So my dad was always late.

1954
02:05:19,711 --> 02:05:24,650
I come from a long line of late guys,
so to speak, but nonetheless. Um,

1955
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:28,620
but I was this guy, I was the guy who
was a good performer. Right? I felt like,

1956
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:32,010
I mean, according to my bosses and
stuff, and I would, you know, I do well,

1957
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:34,860
other than the time thing,
I was pretty reliable,

1958
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:41,250
very reliable in the nightclub industry.
So, and I'd always justify it like,

1959
02:05:41,251 --> 02:05:41,491
man,

1960
02:05:41,491 --> 02:05:46,491
all this time I would take to be prepared
to get there and find parking and all

1961
02:05:48,181 --> 02:05:52,800
this stuff. I could be doing
something else in my life or whatever.

1962
02:05:52,801 --> 02:05:54,600
Not necessarily useful stuff,
but just something else.

1963
02:05:54,601 --> 02:05:59,130
Why do I have to work while
I'm not working? You know,
like preparing for work.

1964
02:05:59,131 --> 02:06:02,340
I know that was kind of my attitude.
As long as I have good output,

1965
02:06:02,341 --> 02:06:07,080
as long as my job is being done,
it's fine. So when I stopped the,

1966
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:11,860
you know, when I was done
with the nightclub industry,
jade, my brother would, um,

1967
02:06:12,090 --> 02:06:15,510
he explained it to me where in the,
the,

1968
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:20,780
the thing that I read that really kind
of hit me was being late is a blatant

1969
02:06:21,421 --> 02:06:26,190
disregard and a blatant
display of disrespect to the
person or people who were

1970
02:06:26,191 --> 02:06:28,350
waiting for you, no doubt
about it. Their time,

1971
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:31,230
which is time is like when
you really think about,

1972
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,910
it's the most valuable thing you have.

1973
02:06:32,911 --> 02:06:35,970
So even if you're talking about one
minute or he's talking about one hour,

1974
02:06:36,210 --> 02:06:39,720
you are wasting that person's time. If
you have a meeting or something, right?

1975
02:06:39,910 --> 02:06:43,380
You show up five minutes late, people
were waiting for you to start the meeting.

1976
02:06:43,381 --> 02:06:46,530
That's five minutes gone where, you know,
we still have to go over that material,

1977
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:50,100
so we're going to spend an extra five
minutes just because you're relate,

1978
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:51,450
because you failed to prepare.

1979
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:55,170
Everyone else was there on time and
you're the one doing it, you know. So,

1980
02:06:55,290 --> 02:06:59,070
and then also I learned through a,
I want to say it was a book I read,

1981
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:04,020
I forget where, but um,
where one of the two major,

1982
02:07:04,021 --> 02:07:08,310
the main things that ensure your success
or we'll get in the way of your success

1983
02:07:08,311 --> 02:07:11,670
is reliability, being reliable. So, and,

1984
02:07:11,671 --> 02:07:13,740
and w one day I went to the store,
right?

1985
02:07:13,741 --> 02:07:17,190
And my wife sends me in the
shopping sprees. She says,
get this kind of tomatoes,

1986
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:19,350
canned tomatoes.
But it was like at this specific kind of,

1987
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:21,960
you ever tried to go chat for
canned tomatoes, Broccoli?

1988
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:24,240
There's like this one and this
one, this one. And I'm like,

1989
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:26,070
I'm just going to either just grab one,

1990
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:29,880
anyone cause I can't find this one
or I'm not going to get him at all.

1991
02:07:29,881 --> 02:07:31,870
I'm just going to go home and be like,
you get to tomatoes if you want.

1992
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:35,160
I don't even want whatever it
is you're making with shit. So

1993
02:07:37,310 --> 02:07:39,910
I have a bat, I'm getting
frustrated on the insight like, oh,

1994
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:45,190
like low down the line of frustrating
things that I've told myself all the way

1995
02:07:45,191 --> 02:07:50,191
to the point of this
isn't my job to do this.

1996
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:54,080
It is my job by the way, but this
isn't my job. I don't want to meet.

1997
02:07:54,081 --> 02:07:56,800
It was why should I even,
why am I even shopping right now?

1998
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:01,000
I'm making a point and in my opinion is a

1999
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:08,500
very important point. So if I do
that, if I'm like, you know what?

2000
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:08,681
Screw it,

2001
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:11,020
I'm not getting the tomatoes or I'm just
going to go ahead and settle for the

2002
02:08:11,021 --> 02:08:11,740
wrong one.

2003
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:16,600
I've demonstrated and basically
proclaim that I am unreliable.

2004
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:19,430
So why would anyone come to me
for anything who's disabled?

2005
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:23,740
I'm going to be reliable
about it. And sure, you might
be reliable on some things,

2006
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:28,540
but you've demonstrated that you can
and will be unreliable under certain

2007
02:08:28,541 --> 02:08:33,010
circumstances and those circumstances
are dictated by by you. So who knows?

2008
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:37,000
Really. You're not gonna
get hired. No, you're not.

2009
02:08:37,030 --> 02:08:40,960
You might not even be somebody's
friend when you think about it. Yeah.

2010
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:45,100
Or husbands or whatever,
you know,

2011
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:50,800
it shows lack of being on time shows a
total disrespect for other people's time

2012
02:08:50,801 --> 02:08:54,100
and it shows a lack of
reliability on your part.

2013
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:57,310
So these are the kinds of things you
got to explain to your subordinates or

2014
02:08:57,311 --> 02:09:01,330
explain to this person that's
being constantly late so
that they understand why

2015
02:09:01,331 --> 02:09:04,330
you're telling them that and then you
they can then they can improve and then

2016
02:09:04,331 --> 02:09:06,760
you can, you know, if the
person's a good performer,

2017
02:09:06,790 --> 02:09:08,170
generally that means
that her type of person,

2018
02:09:08,171 --> 02:09:10,930
I care about how they're
perceived and doing a good job.

2019
02:09:10,931 --> 02:09:15,931
So let's get them to understand how
being late effects everybody else and

2020
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:21,640
affects their own reputation as,
as a performer.

2021
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:26,780
Yeah. So it'll mean something to them.
Plus you'll be at come through guy.

2022
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,030
Everyone likes to come through.
Guy Guy who comes through.

2023
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:32,780
I'm sure they liked you
for coming in on time.

2024
02:09:32,781 --> 02:09:37,760
Every single day for 20
years they did mix question.

2025
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:39,470
Okay.

2026
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:43,400
You stated in prior podcasts that you are
grateful for an understanding wife who

2027
02:09:43,401 --> 02:09:46,070
allowed you to treat your seal
career as a number one priority.

2028
02:09:46,430 --> 02:09:50,960
Do you believe that marriage and children
should bring about a reprioritization

2029
02:09:50,961 --> 02:09:55,610
of your life? Given that marriage and
Al brings another person on your life,

2030
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:56,593
a partner,

2031
02:09:57,470 --> 02:10:01,970
but also someone who relies on you and
especially children who heavily rely on

2032
02:10:01,971 --> 02:10:05,720
you. How did you reconcile, still treating
the seals as a number one priority,

2033
02:10:05,990 --> 02:10:10,340
both the wife and children you brought,
willing to willingly into your life?

2034
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:14,100
Was there a point that despite having
an understanding of life that you should

2035
02:10:14,101 --> 02:10:19,101
have made the decision to end the seal
career early because of people you have a

2036
02:10:19,311 --> 02:10:24,311
newfound responsibility for debatably
a responsibility greater than the

2037
02:10:24,351 --> 02:10:26,060
responsibility for your career.

2038
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:34,760
So this one, this is something that
can be for people to understand,

2039
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:38,420
but yes,

2040
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:44,200
the seal teams was my number
one priority over my family,

2041
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:48,500
over my wife, over my
kids, over my own life,

2042
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:53,210
over everything.
And just Fyi,

2043
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:58,240
I literally told my wife that before we
got married multiple times on the way to

2044
02:10:59,361 --> 02:11:04,190
the chapel or to the San Diego courthouse
to get married on the way there on the

2045
02:11:04,191 --> 02:11:07,700
bridge, driving from corn auto
to San Diego. I said, hey listen,

2046
02:11:07,701 --> 02:11:09,680
I just want to give you one last chance.

2047
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:14,180
Being a seal is not just what I do.

2048
02:11:14,181 --> 02:11:18,500
It's who I am and you are not going to
change me so don't think that I'm going

2049
02:11:18,501 --> 02:11:22,670
to change. And she was like,
oh, I know, I know what you are.

2050
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:26,030
You still want to do
this? Yes, let's go do it.

2051
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:30,410
And what was good was to her credit,

2052
02:11:30,411 --> 02:11:33,470
she didn't try and challenge that.
She didn't try and fight that.

2053
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:37,040
She gave that to me.

2054
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:41,510
She understood it and it's probably one
of the reasons why we stayed married for

2055
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:45,590
so long and a lot, I mean to
seal teams, if you don't know,

2056
02:11:45,591 --> 02:11:49,910
this has about a 90% divorce rate.
It's an astronomical divorce rate.

2057
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:54,530
And the reason a lot of it is because
the guys are so dedicated to the seal

2058
02:11:54,531 --> 02:11:59,270
teams that everything else starts
taking a a second, a backseat.

2059
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:04,280
Now I think that my wife actually saw
that I was loyal and I was dedicated to

2060
02:12:04,281 --> 02:12:08,570
the seal teams and therefore she saw
that as something that was positive and

2061
02:12:08,571 --> 02:12:11,960
something that would transfer
over to other parts of my life,

2062
02:12:11,961 --> 02:12:16,940
including my family.
Now to answer more on this guy's question,

2063
02:12:16,941 --> 02:12:20,540
I want to think about this being a seal.

2064
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:26,260
The best thing I could do for my
family was be dedicated to my job.

2065
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:32,940
It was the best thing I could do
for the others tools I worked with.

2066
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:37,260
It was the best thing I
could do for myself and for
my family was to be the best

2067
02:12:37,261 --> 02:12:41,310
seal possible. Why? Because
we're going into combat.

2068
02:12:42,430 --> 02:12:43,150
Okay.

2069
02:12:43,150 --> 02:12:48,010
And if I want to come home alive to my
family and I want my brothers to come

2070
02:12:48,011 --> 02:12:49,420
home alive to their families,

2071
02:12:49,421 --> 02:12:53,380
the best thing we could possibly do for
our families is to be totally dedicated

2072
02:12:53,381 --> 02:12:55,480
to the job so that we're ready,
we're prepared,

2073
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:58,660
and we can bring each other back.

2074
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:05,360
So I, that's the way it is.

2075
02:13:05,690 --> 02:13:08,780
And I would stand by that to this day.

2076
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:15,160
And it actually does transfer in many
cases to normal civilian careers because

2077
02:13:17,810 --> 02:13:21,330
being
hardworking and being dedicated,

2078
02:13:21,331 --> 02:13:26,331
your job generally is going to translate
to being more successful in your job

2079
02:13:26,341 --> 02:13:29,190
and if you're more successful in your job,
you have more financial stability,

2080
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,310
right? If you have more financial, I mean,

2081
02:13:32,311 --> 02:13:35,910
how many fights in families take
place because of finances? I mean,

2082
02:13:35,911 --> 02:13:39,780
I think that's probably the leading cause
of problems and families is there is a,

2083
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:45,350
there's financial strain and so I think
that it does translate somewhat to

2084
02:13:47,251 --> 02:13:49,800
people in their normal careers,
even if they're not seals,

2085
02:13:49,801 --> 02:13:53,460
if they're not preparing for war,
that they're trying to do a good job,

2086
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:58,550
they're being dedicated to their jobs
so that they can perform better and have

2087
02:13:58,591 --> 02:14:02,250
more stability in their lives. And
by the way, when you work harder,

2088
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:03,690
you get rewarded more.

2089
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:07,200
It also eventually translates into
more freedom because you move into a

2090
02:14:07,201 --> 02:14:08,160
leadership position.

2091
02:14:08,430 --> 02:14:12,210
Maybe you go into a situation where
you're no longer working for somebody

2092
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:14,670
directly and there are over
you and they're demanding.

2093
02:14:14,671 --> 02:14:16,380
Now all of a sudden you get a
little more freedom. You can,

2094
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:20,340
you can dictate what happens in your
life more. So that's important as well.

2095
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:24,030
And also into on top of all that,

2096
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:28,170
guess what? The way you act
and the way you carry yourself,

2097
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:32,700
you are actually teaching your
family and your children something.

2098
02:14:33,710 --> 02:14:34,170
Okay?

2099
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:37,590
Now, if you're a warrior,
if you're a military guy,

2100
02:14:37,591 --> 02:14:41,280
if you're then you or your children,
guess what?

2101
02:14:42,690 --> 02:14:47,690
Warriors have been going away to war for
thousands and thousands and thousands

2102
02:14:48,631 --> 02:14:53,631
of years and people have
been just fine from that.

2103
02:14:55,410 --> 02:15:00,410
The men have been raised by their moms
because their dad was gone away to war.

2104
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:02,820
That's the way it is.

2105
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,840
So I think that that's okay.

2106
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:11,490
It doesn't mean that the warrior
doesn't love his family. He does,

2107
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:16,200
but he's got a job to do and he's
going to go do it. And also if again,

2108
02:15:16,201 --> 02:15:19,320
if you apply that to a
normal civilian situation,

2109
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:24,500
if your children see that you are
dedicated, that you are hardworking,

2110
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:26,250
that you are a loyal,

2111
02:15:27,330 --> 02:15:31,050
that's a positive example that
you're setting for your kids.

2112
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:33,840
Now,
of course,

2113
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:35,580
okay.

2114
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:40,160
The the shouldn't be thinking and I
never came home to my kids and said,

2115
02:15:40,161 --> 02:15:44,990
hey look, you're number two on the list
of priorities around here right now.

2116
02:15:44,991 --> 02:15:46,730
I might've said, listen,
I've got a job to do.

2117
02:15:46,910 --> 02:15:49,310
I've got guys that are depending on me,

2118
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:53,560
we're going to combat
bad things can happen.

2119
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:58,680
I need to be ready and I need to be ready
for my guys and I need to be ready for

2120
02:15:59,561 --> 02:16:00,394
you.

2121
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:07,070
And so I don't think you need to
throw it in people's face and say, no,

2122
02:16:07,071 --> 02:16:08,390
you're the number two priority,

2123
02:16:08,391 --> 02:16:11,510
but your family should understand
that you're working hard for them.

2124
02:16:11,511 --> 02:16:14,290
You're building their future,
you're building it, you're,

2125
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:16,820
you're building a legacy for your family.

2126
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:20,720
That's what you're doing when
you're working hard at any job.

2127
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:22,850
So I think that's a good,

2128
02:16:24,290 --> 02:16:26,390
I think that's a good example to set.

2129
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:27,790
Okay.

2130
02:16:27,790 --> 02:16:32,790
And I think that there's nothing wrong
with that example now where people can go

2131
02:16:34,631 --> 02:16:38,350
too far, which of course they can,
they can do it in the military,

2132
02:16:38,351 --> 02:16:43,351
they can do it in their civilian career
where the job becomes not just the short

2133
02:16:45,371 --> 02:16:49,690
term, um, priority.

2134
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:51,250
Because I will say this,

2135
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:56,620
my longterm priority was my family,
right?

2136
02:16:56,621 --> 02:16:59,470
That was the long term priority.
I mean I had these, the, you know,

2137
02:16:59,471 --> 02:17:01,990
my wife and kids I'm going to raise them
are going to put that they're going to

2138
02:17:01,991 --> 02:17:04,660
be with me forever. That's the,
that's what I'm doing with my life.

2139
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:09,730
So the long term priority is definitely
the family, but the short term priority,

2140
02:17:09,731 --> 02:17:12,880
and by short term, when I'm talking to
years, right? Two years, five years,

2141
02:17:12,881 --> 02:17:17,170
three years, that's a long, that's a short
term priority compared to your family,

2142
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,360
which is going to be
with you until you die.

2143
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:25,480
And so I think you need to keep that
in mind and make sure that you're not

2144
02:17:25,481 --> 02:17:29,740
sacrificing things long term.

2145
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:31,631
You know the words,

2146
02:17:31,631 --> 02:17:34,180
if you're going to destroy your
marriage because you're working so hard,

2147
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:35,410
you got problems.

2148
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:38,980
If you're going to destroy your marriage
because you're dedicated to much to

2149
02:17:38,981 --> 02:17:40,570
your job,
that's not,

2150
02:17:40,571 --> 02:17:44,890
that's not supporting the longterm
strategy of taking care of your family.

2151
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:51,490
So that's sort of where I
come out on that. And again,

2152
02:17:51,491 --> 02:17:55,240
tons of credit to my, to my wife
and my kids who were, you know,

2153
02:17:55,241 --> 02:17:59,110
I was gone all the time and they
dealt with it. And guess what,

2154
02:17:59,111 --> 02:18:03,280
I'm gone a lot too now I'm
traveling all the time. And again,

2155
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:06,850
they all know that, hey, I'd love
to be staying home with them,

2156
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:11,320
but I've got to take care of the family.
I've got to support the family,

2157
02:18:11,410 --> 02:18:13,660
I've got to maintain

2158
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:19,840
my situation so that I can take care of
them if something bad were to happen.

2159
02:18:20,210 --> 02:18:21,700
Yeah.
And I think they understand that.

2160
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:26,450
Yeah. And that's, I think that's
a big component where you know,

2161
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:29,760
your wife and your kids, they do
understand. And I'm assuming, I mean,

2162
02:18:29,761 --> 02:18:32,970
given what I know about you guys is that,
that you're,

2163
02:18:33,210 --> 02:18:35,520
you're pretty clear through
what you say and what you do.

2164
02:18:35,580 --> 02:18:38,420
That you are supporting them and
they are a part of your life.

2165
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:39,970
You don't cause some people,
let's say, I don't know,

2166
02:18:40,230 --> 02:18:43,950
this is a hypothetical situation, but
let's say a cop, right? Or detective,

2167
02:18:44,130 --> 02:18:47,790
he's really into his job. He's frustrated
with the job and this goes for any job.

2168
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:51,870
The comes home, he's frustrated because
whatever work stuff he comes home,

2169
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:55,230
but he's not dedicated to his
relationship or his family that much.

2170
02:18:55,231 --> 02:18:58,650
So he allows the frustrations of work to

2171
02:19:00,150 --> 02:19:03,960
carry over, carry over. He takes it out
on his wife because she said, you know,

2172
02:19:03,961 --> 02:19:05,820
do the dishes,
you forgot whatever.

2173
02:19:05,821 --> 02:19:08,250
She then he's even more mad
because he's frustrated with work.

2174
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:11,760
Like that kind of thing where, you know,
he kind of in the back of his mind,

2175
02:19:11,761 --> 02:19:14,450
he regards his family as
something that should, I dunno,

2176
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:19,140
serve him while he does his,
you know, real lot in life,

2177
02:19:19,141 --> 02:19:21,630
which is be an amazing detective,
you know.

2178
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:25,020
So I think a lot of times there's that.
And then on top of it,

2179
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:27,670
the family wife or

2180
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,600
the wife,
um,

2181
02:19:29,870 --> 02:19:34,130
has these expectations that are not clear,
not,

2182
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:35,900
not correct,
but it that way you know,

2183
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:40,220
where you know you should be
home at a certain time. You know,

2184
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:44,510
you shouldn't be working late. You know,
where your family, that's the worst.

2185
02:19:44,511 --> 02:19:48,200
It's like I'm not coming home like, oh,
I'm done with work and the seal teams,

2186
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:49,070
I'm done with work,

2187
02:19:49,070 --> 02:19:53,270
but I'm going to the bar with the guys
and I'll be home at midnight or one

2188
02:19:53,271 --> 02:19:56,090
o'clock in the morning or two o'clock
in the morning. And guess what,

2189
02:19:56,960 --> 02:20:00,620
my wife actually understood that.
She actually understood that, hey,

2190
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:04,190
these guys are a team, these guys
are a family of their own right.

2191
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:09,520
And I got to let him go and develop and
hang out with his friends because he's

2192
02:20:10,791 --> 02:20:13,700
got to know these guys better than anybody
in the world. Yeah, see and that's,

2193
02:20:13,701 --> 02:20:17,750
that's, that's a hard thing for
a, for some people to handle.

2194
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:22,340
And now when you've got to be
careful with navy seals, to me, yeah,

2195
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:24,080
that's absolutely true and legitimate.

2196
02:20:24,081 --> 02:20:27,830
But some guys might use that as like an
excuse just to not have to come home and

2197
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:32,120
wash dishes, you know, of
course then they're, then
they're wrong. Right, right. So,

2198
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:36,410
you know, kind of be careful with Allen,
like, um, you know, I dunno a sales guy,

2199
02:20:36,411 --> 02:20:41,290
he closes the deal and guys
want to celebrate, you know,

2200
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:44,060
meanwhile it's done. I know mother's
Day or something, I don't know,

2201
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:49,130
something or something to eat or
Thursday can eat it, you know? Um,

2202
02:20:49,550 --> 02:20:50,410
and you know,

2203
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:54,650
I don't think it's unreasonable for
wives to have certain expectations,

2204
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:56,710
especially if you don't
address them. Like, you know,

2205
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:59,220
you don't communicate or whatever. Like
you have expectations, you have to,

2206
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:02,540
you have an expectation for your
husband to come home after work you do.

2207
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:06,500
So if he just doesn't show up all of a
sudden, yeah. You know, I mean you're,

2208
02:21:06,890 --> 02:21:10,430
I'm assuming you're going to tell your
wife, Hey, I'm not gonna. This is why.

2209
02:21:10,431 --> 02:21:13,670
Just like, are you saying you're
going to explain everything? But some,

2210
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:17,780
they're like, I'm the man, I don't have
to come home right now if I don't want to.

2211
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:21,770
Which is kind of true. But you're
in a relationship, you're in a team,

2212
02:21:21,790 --> 02:21:23,210
especially good in.
And really,

2213
02:21:23,211 --> 02:21:27,380
I would say one thing that's awesome about
my wife is I would say, Oh yeah, sorry,

2214
02:21:27,381 --> 02:21:28,011
I didn't come home.

2215
02:21:28,011 --> 02:21:33,011
I was going out with the boys and she
was independent enough and secure enough

2216
02:21:36,470 --> 02:21:40,370
and confident enough that she was
like, oh, okay, whatever. Hey,

2217
02:21:40,371 --> 02:21:43,120
I'm going to go on to do
this. Most of the time, yeah,

2218
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:47,780
there was some times flowers were
bought, things were, things were rebuilt.

2219
02:21:48,150 --> 02:21:52,760
Uh, because you know, it's,
uh, it's life, right? Yeah.

2220
02:21:52,761 --> 02:21:57,050
And no one's going to be like 100%
focused on that. Um, you know,

2221
02:21:57,080 --> 02:22:01,910
that situation or the, the, the, um, you
know, you go, how you say you, you said,

2222
02:22:01,970 --> 02:22:05,900
I'm a navy seal, don't, you know,
don't change me or whatever. She,

2223
02:22:05,901 --> 02:22:09,230
that's not going to be on the front of
her mind hundred percent of the time she

2224
02:22:09,231 --> 02:22:13,290
has. She's a person, you know, and
she loves, they can change you.

2225
02:22:14,010 --> 02:22:16,520
Yeah. And even if they
know, ultimately they can't,

2226
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:20,200
they still for a day they might, you
know, and it can go back, you know,

2227
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:23,990
back and forth. So yeah, it's not
going to go perfect, but as long,

2228
02:22:23,991 --> 02:22:26,460
just like how you were
saying you that early

2229
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:31,140
and she is a strong enough person to be
like understand that and understand the

2230
02:22:31,141 --> 02:22:34,010
value of that throughout the
whole process, then you know,

2231
02:22:34,011 --> 02:22:35,910
then you're going to have
success with that kind of thing.

2232
02:22:35,911 --> 02:22:40,911
But it depends on how good you
communicate it and how willing the Ger,

2233
02:22:41,430 --> 02:22:43,860
your wife or husband or
whatever the situation is. Um,

2234
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:48,870
it depends on how good they can receive
it and go through it because some people

2235
02:22:48,871 --> 02:22:50,820
are needy, man. Yeah.
And you know, though,

2236
02:22:51,390 --> 02:22:52,201
a lot of military,

2237
02:22:52,201 --> 02:22:57,201
I've been talking to a lot of military
people that listen to the podcast spouses

2238
02:22:57,570 --> 02:23:02,010
and service members and so yeah,
guess what?

2239
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:07,760
Give your service member some room to
form those bonds to be dedicated to that

2240
02:23:08,911 --> 02:23:13,080
job because they are truly doing
it for you. They really are.

2241
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:18,030
They're doing it for you. And now
service members, as echo just said,

2242
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:21,300
don't abuse the privilege.
You don't abuse it.

2243
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:26,460
Do what you gotta do.
Be the best you can be at your job,

2244
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:28,830
bond with your brothers in arms,

2245
02:23:29,770 --> 02:23:33,930
would that you're going on the
battlefield with whether you're a cop,

2246
02:23:33,931 --> 02:23:36,630
whether you're a firefighter,
build those bonds,

2247
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:41,370
but of course don't abuse it and make
sure you take care of your family too.

2248
02:23:42,130 --> 02:23:44,560
Yeah,
Jessica,

2249
02:23:45,370 --> 02:23:48,610
can you lead those that
don't want to be led?

2250
02:23:49,810 --> 02:23:51,430
It's still how?
Hmm.

2251
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:55,010
The beauty of that question
is in its simplicity,

2252
02:23:57,350 --> 02:24:02,150
and the answer is
yes and no.

2253
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:08,150
You can't lead them in
the traditional sense.

2254
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:13,150
You have to be indirect.
Again, there's our word.

2255
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:17,620
Do you have to be indirect?
Meaning you can't say, hey,
you need to do that, or hey,

2256
02:24:17,621 --> 02:24:20,620
I order you to do that.
You need to be indirect.

2257
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:26,980
And the best way to do that with people
that do not want to be led is to let

2258
02:24:27,321 --> 02:24:28,370
them lead.

2259
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:30,560
Put the,
put them

2260
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:34,570
in a leadership role. Say, Hey, you
know what? You're really good at this.

2261
02:24:34,580 --> 02:24:37,150
I think you've got a good vision
here. Can you, can you run this,

2262
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:38,230
can you lead this?

2263
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:42,500
And then once they're
in a leadership role,

2264
02:24:42,830 --> 02:24:47,830
then you can make suggestions and you
can subtly steer them as they lead.

2265
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:53,030
But a important point is that you actually
have to be ready to let them lead.

2266
02:24:53,870 --> 02:24:56,240
You can't just be like,
oh, I want you to run this.

2267
02:24:56,241 --> 02:24:59,510
And then all of a sudden you go all
level seven micromanagement on people.

2268
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:03,590
You have to let them lead.
You have to let it go.

2269
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,230
Let them go.

2270
02:25:07,470 --> 02:25:12,470
Now you do need to make sure
that they're being safe,

2271
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:14,730
you know, or make sure that
they're being profitable.

2272
02:25:14,731 --> 02:25:19,050
Make sure that we're not doing anything
illegal or agregious in what they're

2273
02:25:19,051 --> 02:25:23,190
doing. But you have to let them lead.
You have to let them make decisions.

2274
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:29,790
And so that, that is my first suggestion
is to put them in a leadership role. Now,

2275
02:25:29,791 --> 02:25:31,920
if there's no way to put
them in a leadership role,

2276
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:35,970
then let them lead their little part
of the mission, whatever that is.

2277
02:25:36,090 --> 02:25:39,870
Let them tell you how they are
going to do things. And again,

2278
02:25:39,871 --> 02:25:42,660
you can make little course
corrections along the way,

2279
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:45,540
but you need to let them lead.
Now,

2280
02:25:45,660 --> 02:25:50,460
one of the hardest parts of both
these situations is guess what?

2281
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:54,210
Your Ego,
because guess what?

2282
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:56,610
You want to be the leader.

2283
02:25:57,930 --> 02:26:02,010
You are offended by someone that
doesn't want to be. Let me look. Well,

2284
02:26:02,011 --> 02:26:05,610
why aren't they listening to me? I am
awesome. I am the leader. I'm in charge.

2285
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:07,200
I outrank them.
Why aren't they listening to me?

2286
02:26:08,610 --> 02:26:13,610
All those are little insecurities that
you have about your own leadership

2287
02:26:13,801 --> 02:26:15,900
capabilities.
Don't let it happen.

2288
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:22,760
I was never offended by subordinates
that I had that wanted to lead more,

2289
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:29,240
that wanted my job.
I wanted them to want to have my job.

2290
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:35,590
I wanted them to be able to take my
job from me. That's what I wanted.

2291
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:37,120
If they're doing that good,

2292
02:26:37,121 --> 02:26:40,570
I can look upwards and outwards and
I can focus on other things. Good.

2293
02:26:40,571 --> 02:26:43,540
Come and take my job,
be good enough to take my job.

2294
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:45,120
Okay.

2295
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:46,470
And if I ever said to myself,

2296
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:49,500
I can't believe this guy's trying to
step up and take my job, I realized,

2297
02:26:49,501 --> 02:26:50,670
Oh my God,
I'm being insecure.

2298
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:54,620
I need to put my own ego in
check because you know what?

2299
02:26:55,190 --> 02:26:57,440
If they can step up and do my job good,

2300
02:26:57,441 --> 02:26:59,570
I'll step up and do the next person's job.

2301
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:05,210
So when somebody below you
doesn't want to be led,

2302
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:09,080
let them lead and be happy
that they want to lead.

2303
02:27:12,310 --> 02:27:13,630
Give them that leadership.

2304
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:16,480
That's what you do with people
that don't want to be led.

2305
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:26,480
I just thought of a riddle.
What kind of,

2306
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:29,750
actually I didn't think of it. I kind
of got it from Twitter than made her,

2307
02:27:29,810 --> 02:27:34,130
made it into a joke. Okay. What,
what kind of stake does Jocko eat?

2308
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:41,020
Ribeye. Flank steak. Oh,

2309
02:27:41,021 --> 02:27:44,950
I like it. Can't take credit. I got
there. I like it. Good job. Twitter.

2310
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:48,730
That's awesome. Good, cool. Good
solid question though. Yeah,

2311
02:27:48,731 --> 02:27:51,970
that's when you hear a lot. Yeah.
And I say said that obviously Joe,

2312
02:27:51,980 --> 02:27:55,960
but that's kind of like fleeting
by way of flank for sure. For sure.

2313
02:27:55,961 --> 02:27:58,930
It's like you don't lead them directly
how you would like traditionally or

2314
02:27:58,931 --> 02:28:02,500
whatever. You're kind of letting
them lead, but allowing them to lead.

2315
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:06,850
It's the flanking them.
I mean the people that are like this,

2316
02:28:06,851 --> 02:28:10,840
these are people that are either
have a big ego or maybe they,

2317
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,280
they know more than you.
Maybe they are more,

2318
02:28:12,281 --> 02:28:15,100
are more experienced and you maybe they
really do know more than you. Right?

2319
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:19,790
And they're bummed or angry cause the,
you've been promoted above them. Yup.

2320
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:23,750
So now what am I going to do? I'm going
to be a jerk. That's what I'm going to do.

2321
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:25,760
And so,
you know,

2322
02:28:25,761 --> 02:28:28,460
I'm not going to support your plan and
I'm not going to do what you tell me to

2323
02:28:28,461 --> 02:28:31,970
do and I'm gonna have my own way of doing
things. That's what's going to happen.

2324
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:34,500
So don't let that happen. All you
gotta do is say, Hey, listen man,

2325
02:28:34,501 --> 02:28:36,670
I really respect what you've done.
You've been doing,

2326
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:40,130
you've been doing this longer than
I have. You know, what can you,

2327
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:44,120
can you run with this? Can you plan this?
Can you execute this? That'd be awesome.

2328
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:50,930
And then they go, oh, okay,
Yup. Now do they think, oh,
that's right. He's an idiot.

2329
02:28:50,931 --> 02:28:54,380
He doesn't know what he's doing. No, not
wanting to do it right now, when you say,

2330
02:28:54,381 --> 02:28:56,510
hey,
you have more experience than me,

2331
02:28:57,350 --> 02:29:01,490
I would really like you to lead this
instead of me. How's that sound?

2332
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:04,280
You can only pull that off if you're
secure in your own leadership.

2333
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:07,250
It's a way it works.

2334
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:12,700
Interesting. Flank him. Point blank style.

2335
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:16,040
At least.
Next question,

2336
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:21,083
Jocko.

2337
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:25,240
Podcast listeners and Twitter followers.
No,

2338
02:29:25,241 --> 02:29:26,890
you're before five daily,

2339
02:29:26,891 --> 02:29:31,891
meaning you're up before five a workout
essentially every day and are devoted a

2340
02:29:32,950 --> 02:29:34,420
devoted student of Jujitsu.

2341
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:35,810
Okay.

2342
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:40,580
What relationship do you see between
physical fitness and empowering the mind

2343
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:45,610
slash wheel when a man commits really
commits to changing as fitness?

2344
02:29:46,671 --> 02:29:47,750
What else changes?

2345
02:29:48,470 --> 02:29:52,460
Well, you heard Bob Hoffman talk
about this a bunch of tonight is book.

2346
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:55,530
Bob Hoffman wrote the book,
the,

2347
02:29:55,640 --> 02:30:00,080
I remember the last war and he
wrote the book how to be strong,

2348
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:05,200
healthy and happy and there's no doubt
that physical fitness is going to help

2349
02:30:05,721 --> 02:30:10,550
you in every facet of life, especially
in terms of what you're talking about.

2350
02:30:10,580 --> 02:30:15,260
Empowering the mind and the will
working out is a test of will,

2351
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:19,130
right? I mean it is going to see,
can you push yourself harder?

2352
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:22,940
Can you get the last rep? Can you
shave another second off the sprint,

2353
02:30:22,941 --> 02:30:25,220
get you lift a little bit heavier.
That's,

2354
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:31,040
that's what working on it is.
It's a test of will and that test of will,

2355
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:35,570
and you've heard me say this before,
starts before the workout starts,

2356
02:30:35,571 --> 02:30:38,840
it starts when the alarm goes off.
Can you get out of bed in the morning?

2357
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:44,020
These are all little tests of discipline
and of will and as we've talked about

2358
02:30:46,071 --> 02:30:49,610
before, discipline begets more
disciplined. The stronger you get,

2359
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:52,370
the stronger you get

2360
02:30:54,900 --> 02:30:58,680
and physical will that it takes to get
through these workouts that it takes to

2361
02:30:58,681 --> 02:30:59,550
get out of bed in the morning.

2362
02:30:59,670 --> 02:31:03,870
That carries over to mental will so you
can eat better foods so you can get work

2363
02:31:03,871 --> 02:31:05,460
done.
So you can control your temper,

2364
02:31:06,620 --> 02:31:10,560
you can create things and improve
things and you can be better.

2365
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:16,680
Now, I remember a while
ago speaking of Twitter,

2366
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:22,320
I posted a picture of
early morning workout.

2367
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:27,350
I got done and then I posted a picture
of a little d post surf session and then

2368
02:31:30,481 --> 02:31:34,440
I posted a picture of posts,
Jujitsu session and you know,

2369
02:31:34,441 --> 02:31:39,300
so these were all like three posts in
a row and someone made some kind of a

2370
02:31:39,301 --> 02:31:42,120
comment that was kind
of along the lines of,

2371
02:31:43,310 --> 02:31:43,660
okay,

2372
02:31:43,660 --> 02:31:48,220
oh, must be rough, right? Must be a
rough life. You know, you're getting up,

2373
02:31:48,221 --> 02:31:51,490
you're just surfing and doing Jujitsu.
And an honesty,

2374
02:31:51,491 --> 02:31:55,060
when I saw that with someone
wrote that I kind of felt bad.

2375
02:31:56,110 --> 02:31:56,943
I kind of felt

2376
02:31:58,490 --> 02:31:59,180
okay,

2377
02:31:59,180 --> 02:32:00,710
guilty in a way,

2378
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:07,360
because here I am, I'm going surfing
and working out, I'm training Jiu Jitsu,

2379
02:32:07,390 --> 02:32:10,660
I'm kind of living the
dream or in fact in my mind,

2380
02:32:10,661 --> 02:32:13,330
I actually am living my dream,

2381
02:32:14,620 --> 02:32:16,690
doing what I want to do
when I want to do it.

2382
02:32:17,170 --> 02:32:20,830
And then there's other people
out there that are grinding,

2383
02:32:21,190 --> 02:32:24,910
that are either overseas, that
are in combat, that are working,

2384
02:32:24,911 --> 02:32:26,710
that are doing jobs that they don't like.

2385
02:32:26,711 --> 02:32:30,930
They're working with people that they
can't stand in a cubicle somewhere,

2386
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:34,090
whatever is that doing in here.
I was almost, I felt like, damn,

2387
02:32:34,091 --> 02:32:38,920
I'm rubbing this in people's faces
and I actually felt bad and I was like,

2388
02:32:38,921 --> 02:32:40,600
yeah, bag. I can't be doing that again

2389
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:44,500
in someone else on Twitter.

2390
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:46,070
Okay.

2391
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:50,930
Came on the same thread
or whatever and said,

2392
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:53,210
discipline equals freedom.

2393
02:32:55,900 --> 02:32:57,140
They quoted me

2394
02:32:59,330 --> 02:33:02,000
and they were right.

2395
02:33:02,930 --> 02:33:04,430
They made a great point.

2396
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:08,000
The reason I'm able to go surfing and do
Jujitsu and work out and do whatever is

2397
02:33:08,001 --> 02:33:11,930
because of discipline throughout my life.

2398
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:13,610
Yeah.

2399
02:33:13,610 --> 02:33:14,151
And again,

2400
02:33:14,151 --> 02:33:19,151
I'm not making no claims right now
to be the ultimate success story.

2401
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:22,790
I'm certainly not, and I
will tell you this, you know,

2402
02:33:22,791 --> 02:33:24,380
I live in a great place right now.

2403
02:33:24,590 --> 02:33:28,670
There was a time where my wife and
I wanted to live down by the beach.

2404
02:33:28,830 --> 02:33:30,640
We bought a house down by the beach,
uh,

2405
02:33:30,710 --> 02:33:35,710
dump that was barely livable
and it was 850 square feet.

2406
02:33:37,100 --> 02:33:41,180
And we had three kids in there and
my wife and I, our bedroom, our bed,

2407
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:44,570
when you open the front door to the
house and walked into the living room,

2408
02:33:44,571 --> 02:33:47,980
our bed was on the floor right
there for a few years. We were,

2409
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:51,740
we just lived there and now
we live in a great house,

2410
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:56,090
but I have to remind people like,
you know what,

2411
02:33:56,360 --> 02:34:01,100
there was a time where I just was sucking
it up and living on navy pay and we

2412
02:34:01,101 --> 02:34:06,101
squeezed into this house and borrowed a
bunch of bunny and lived on the floor in

2413
02:34:06,231 --> 02:34:07,064
the living room.

2414
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:08,780
Okay.

2415
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:13,340
But we had that discipline back then.
And then the discipline of eventually

2416
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:15,880
okay

2417
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:17,020
becomes a form of.

2418
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:23,340
And so it wasn't always like this where
I was just chilling in surfing and doing

2419
02:34:23,341 --> 02:34:26,640
Jujitsu and playing guitar and whatever,
you know, there was a lot of blood,

2420
02:34:26,641 --> 02:34:30,630
sweat and tears along the way. And
I, and, and by the way, the blood,

2421
02:34:30,631 --> 02:34:35,490
sweat and tears along the way. I actually
enjoyed. I enjoyed, I wouldn't trade it.

2422
02:34:36,180 --> 02:34:41,180
I'm glad that I was putting those
situations to do those things.

2423
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:44,370
And most importantly,

2424
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:46,893
this

2425
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:50,350
is available to anybody that,

2426
02:34:50,351 --> 02:34:53,890
that life that you want is out there.

2427
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:58,840
And it might be a few years in the future,
but it's there and you can get to it.

2428
02:34:58,841 --> 02:35:00,040
And the path,

2429
02:35:01,420 --> 02:35:06,420
the path getting there starts early in
the morning and it ends late at night and

2430
02:35:07,691 --> 02:35:12,220
it requires sacrifice and discipline
and it requires force of will.

2431
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:16,150
And that comes at four 30 in the
morning when the alarm goes off,

2432
02:35:16,151 --> 02:35:20,800
that's when it comes. So
get up and go get it. And

2433
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:23,730
that's okay.

2434
02:35:24,110 --> 02:35:24,943
Why?

2435
02:35:25,390 --> 02:35:30,390
And I think that the idea of physical
fitness in powering the mind and the will,

2436
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:35,690
I think that's what happens
when you commit to those things.

2437
02:35:35,691 --> 02:35:40,490
I think the rest of your life will reflect
positively on what you've done and go,

2438
02:35:40,520 --> 02:35:42,680
guess what? I've been
real lucky to, you know,

2439
02:35:42,681 --> 02:35:47,660
I've been very lucky along the way
and I won't, I won't say that, uh,

2440
02:35:47,930 --> 02:35:51,020
you know, I made everything
happen myself. I got lucky.

2441
02:35:51,021 --> 02:35:54,620
I was blessed in a lot of situations
that had good things happen. I mean,

2442
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:59,900
for instance, the housing market
crashed and I was in the navy.

2443
02:36:00,050 --> 02:36:02,980
It didn't matter to me. I mean I had
a couple of houses and I was like, oh,

2444
02:36:03,050 --> 02:36:06,110
I didn't even notice there was a housing
market crash until I was buying more

2445
02:36:06,111 --> 02:36:10,250
houses and they were cheaper. You
know, it. But it wasn't, that was luck.

2446
02:36:10,700 --> 02:36:13,880
Didn't plan that it was might've
been a longterm strategy. Hey,

2447
02:36:13,881 --> 02:36:16,850
I want to buy houses.
But you know,

2448
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:20,330
a lot of people got caught upside down
and some rough situations in the housing

2449
02:36:20,331 --> 02:36:25,310
market. And I was lucky in the fact
that I hadn't overextended myself again.

2450
02:36:25,311 --> 02:36:30,110
Maybe that's partial luck, partial
strategy, but that's a situation. Again,

2451
02:36:30,111 --> 02:36:34,590
I'm just trying to point out that I know
I've been lucky and in some of it, um,

2452
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:38,240
but let's make our luck with
some hard work for sure.

2453
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:41,680
Yeah, just you pointing that out
that you got lucky, you know,

2454
02:36:41,681 --> 02:36:44,470
and you recognize it. Some people,
a lot of people they don't like,

2455
02:36:44,530 --> 02:36:46,610
they don't want to recognize
all the factors. You know,

2456
02:36:46,930 --> 02:36:51,930
it's just easy to blame something else
for what did it happen and then blame,

2457
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:55,120
not playing, but take credit yourself
for something that does happen. Good.

2458
02:36:55,270 --> 02:36:59,830
You know, so you're, you're over here
recognizing everything kind of the good,

2459
02:36:59,940 --> 02:37:04,510
which is party,
your discipline way of being,

2460
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:09,570
um, back to your, your, your
Twitter posts situation. That was,

2461
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:13,750
that was good. That was heavy.
That was good. Right there.
I thought. Um, and I know,

2462
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:18,830
thinking about someone who posted
must be, must be rough, right?

2463
02:37:18,831 --> 02:37:23,750
Like a sarcastic yes. Obviously that
was just a fun peanut jerk. Yeah.

2464
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:27,900
Right, right. I don't think so. So let's
get that out of the way. Yeah. And,

2465
02:37:27,901 --> 02:37:32,180
and if he, you actually in a, in a good
way, some people might be like, Hey,

2466
02:37:32,181 --> 02:37:34,190
I worked for this stuff.
Don't say that, you know,

2467
02:37:34,191 --> 02:37:35,850
take it the wrong way or whatever.
But you didn't,

2468
02:37:35,870 --> 02:37:37,250
you took it in the opposite way,

2469
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:40,700
which it says yet again more
about you and your approach.

2470
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:46,800
So that being said, let me add
this little part to it where, um,

2471
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:50,450
when you look at those Twitter posts, like
that Twitter post, right, you have your,

2472
02:37:50,451 --> 02:37:54,920
you know, the, the aftermath of
your workout. You know, go look at,

2473
02:37:55,370 --> 02:38:00,050
or Instagram, whatever. Look at
every single day of your posts.

2474
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:05,140
Every single day you'll see four 34 wake
up workout for three every single day.

2475
02:38:07,940 --> 02:38:11,000
And then step one, step back and
look at all of them all at once.

2476
02:38:11,180 --> 02:38:15,560
That's just the clear picture of your
discipline of you're doing it every single

2477
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:16,341
day. Cause like, okay,

2478
02:38:16,341 --> 02:38:20,870
I understand I can wake up at four 34
tomorrow if I want to and I'll get a

2479
02:38:20,871 --> 02:38:24,740
workout in and I'll be like, look at
me, I'm Jocko and then go surfing.

2480
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:26,480
Go do Jujitsu and eat plank stick.

2481
02:38:27,050 --> 02:38:32,050
But if you expect me to do that every
single day and I'm not used to it and,

2482
02:38:34,431 --> 02:38:37,430
and I do it that same a lot more,

2483
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:43,130
and you do that. So there's your
picture. That's what it is. Of course.

2484
02:38:43,131 --> 02:38:45,200
Don't focus on just that
little narrow view of, Ooh,

2485
02:38:45,201 --> 02:38:50,030
how cool it was that he got to do,
do you do to surf all day cruise,

2486
02:38:50,031 --> 02:38:52,770
look at the big picture and that
picture just like I used to.

2487
02:38:52,771 --> 02:38:55,430
Disability equals freedom. There it
is. There's your picture right there.

2488
02:38:55,431 --> 02:38:56,264
Right there on Twitter.

2489
02:38:57,250 --> 02:38:58,920
Yeah, that was cool. That was cool.

2490
02:38:58,921 --> 02:39:02,290
It's somebody actually had to point that
out to me when I read it. I was like,

2491
02:39:02,291 --> 02:39:04,660
damn they,
they're making it very good point.

2492
02:39:05,780 --> 02:39:10,550
Yeah. Yeah, but man, that's like
the perfect example in my opinion,

2493
02:39:10,551 --> 02:39:14,000
that discipline equals freedom.
It's like within that picture of freedom,

2494
02:39:14,030 --> 02:39:18,620
all you see is discipline all over it.
Starting with the four 34 in the morning.

2495
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:22,310
And you know, I tell Ya, if I would have
had more discipline throughout my life,

2496
02:39:22,311 --> 02:39:24,740
I'd be in an even better
situation than I am right now.

2497
02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:28,310
Like I look back and Saint Man, what
did I do this for? What I do that for?

2498
02:39:28,910 --> 02:39:33,800
And that's one thing that as now when
people talk to me and ask me questions,

2499
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:37,730
I'm trying to tell him what mistakes
I made. Things that I did wrong,

2500
02:39:37,731 --> 02:39:41,660
things that I did that were stupid
so that they can say, oh, okay,

2501
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:45,230
because the opportunities are out there.
You know,

2502
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:48,230
the opportunities are out there to
make good things happen in your life,

2503
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:50,450
but you're going to have,
they're not gonna,

2504
02:39:50,510 --> 02:39:54,320
they're not gonna show up
at your doorstep. They're
not coming to your doorstep.

2505
02:39:54,470 --> 02:39:55,880
I'm gonna go ahead and tell
everybody that right now.

2506
02:39:56,060 --> 02:39:59,120
You have to go out and
make of them happen.

2507
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:03,530
You have to go out and take them because
they're not going to come knocking on

2508
02:40:03,531 --> 02:40:05,970
your door. The good deals not
coming to your door, not happen.

2509
02:40:06,190 --> 02:40:08,200
It's so crazy how obvious that sounds.

2510
02:40:08,201 --> 02:40:11,110
You know that other than like you saying
that, I'm not going to be like, Hey,

2511
02:40:11,111 --> 02:40:13,920
I never realized that. I thought
they were going come to my doorstep.

2512
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:18,720
But it's almost like most people,
I don't say most people,

2513
02:40:18,721 --> 02:40:23,040
but it's almost like people don't really
understand that that's true because you

2514
02:40:23,041 --> 02:40:26,430
have like people who watch TV,

2515
02:40:26,431 --> 02:40:30,540
like if you can't remember last,
remember that. I never watched it.

2516
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:32,490
I watched a few episodes,

2517
02:40:32,491 --> 02:40:36,420
but I remember people were just really
into that and they're like talking about

2518
02:40:36,421 --> 02:40:41,120
loss and the characters because that
was a confusing shows. Why use that? Um,

2519
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:44,970
and they're talking about this like they
know all the details and they're trying

2520
02:40:44,971 --> 02:40:48,700
to figure this out and it over
like seasons upon seasons of loss.

2521
02:40:48,701 --> 02:40:50,640
And they know that like,
Bro,

2522
02:40:50,641 --> 02:40:55,641
you know what you could have been doing
with all that mental energy and the time

2523
02:40:55,771 --> 02:40:58,200
that it takes to watch all this.
So you could have been doing a lot.

2524
02:40:58,380 --> 02:41:03,090
And that last example is just one of
many examples of what we all do. I think,

2525
02:41:03,250 --> 02:41:08,250
well it's very fitting place called lost
cause you lost a bunch of time and a

2526
02:41:08,681 --> 02:41:10,450
bunch of opportunity in your life.

2527
02:41:11,460 --> 02:41:15,310
I mean there's things that can be
so inspiring. I guess some artwork,

2528
02:41:15,430 --> 02:41:19,090
there were some art form or some film or
movie or show that can be so inspiring

2529
02:41:19,091 --> 02:41:21,700
to you. But if it's not
inspiring to you, it's not,

2530
02:41:21,730 --> 02:41:26,730
it's not forcing you to get out and make
something more of yourself or create

2531
02:41:27,371 --> 02:41:27,881
something more than,

2532
02:41:27,881 --> 02:41:30,100
it's probably not worth your
while to be quite honest with you.

2533
02:41:30,190 --> 02:41:33,820
Right. And, and again,
the, the whole, you know,

2534
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:37,960
last situation. I mean if that,
hey, everyone's different. I know,

2535
02:41:37,961 --> 02:41:42,000
but when you're watching TV, which
is just, I think a huge one that,

2536
02:41:42,001 --> 02:41:44,080
that people waste their time on.
I mean,

2537
02:41:44,081 --> 02:41:48,070
I can get some inspiration from TV
with cinema stuff because I'm in video.

2538
02:41:48,550 --> 02:41:51,820
But I think that I would argue that
that's not why most people watch TV.

2539
02:41:51,850 --> 02:41:55,570
That's not why they're watching.
Uh, keeping up with the Kardashians.

2540
02:41:55,690 --> 02:41:59,260
I'll tell you that.
So I'm not familiar with this.

2541
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:03,980
It's a show on TV nonetheless.
Um,

2542
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:07,000
people don't act like that.
That's true.

2543
02:42:07,210 --> 02:42:09,880
That Opportunity's not going to
just come knocking on your door.

2544
02:42:10,210 --> 02:42:13,270
It goes back to what you're talking about
earlier today. Are you going to let,

2545
02:42:13,271 --> 02:42:18,010
are you going to, you only have so much
time. You only have so much time in.

2546
02:42:18,011 --> 02:42:22,620
If you miss a workout, if you miss
a moment with your family, if you,

2547
02:42:22,621 --> 02:42:26,970
whatever you're missing, is it
worth it? You're letting it go away.

2548
02:42:27,090 --> 02:42:31,260
You only got that day is only
going to go buy one time.

2549
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:34,590
You only got one shot at today.
What are you gonna do with it?

2550
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:40,240
Yeah. Do something good. Yeah. It's just,

2551
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:45,250
yeah, it's just so interesting.
Interesting how, again,
this is like nothing new,

2552
02:42:45,251 --> 02:42:49,780
you know, but I feel like we're,
a lot of us act like that.

2553
02:42:49,781 --> 02:42:53,410
That's simply not true.
And that weird though.

2554
02:42:54,520 --> 02:42:58,440
It is because it's such a big, you know,
you have a lot long time on this earth.

2555
02:42:58,441 --> 02:43:01,590
If you,
if you just sit back and go day to day,

2556
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:04,260
then wasting a few hours
watching a TV program,

2557
02:43:04,261 --> 02:43:07,380
maybe it doesn't seem like a big deal
when you add all those hours up and you

2558
02:43:07,381 --> 02:43:09,870
subtract them from the actual
time that you've got here. Man,

2559
02:43:09,871 --> 02:43:11,070
don't let it go to waste.

2560
02:43:13,350 --> 02:43:16,420
True.
Don't do it.

2561
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:21,190
One of the guys on lost was named Mr
Echo by the way. Thank you. Died though.

2562
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:24,460
I don't know. I wish you wouldn't have
given me that information from my head.

2563
02:43:24,461 --> 02:43:28,330
You've wasted space in my head.
I like echo actual,

2564
02:43:29,370 --> 02:43:33,760
we'll stick with that then. All
right. Um, I think the last one. Yeah,

2565
02:43:33,761 --> 02:43:36,550
I think we got time for one more.
Jocko.

2566
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:41,110
I lost my little brother who died
in a random medical accident.

2567
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:43,780
He was someone that I always looked after.

2568
02:43:44,770 --> 02:43:48,280
How do you deal with grief and
loss of men in your command?

2569
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:50,113
Yeah.

2570
02:43:53,100 --> 02:43:57,510
Someone asked me a similar
question that the other day.

2571
02:43:57,511 --> 02:44:02,511
Some of them along the lines of how going
to be good when you lose a loved one.

2572
02:44:05,780 --> 02:44:09,980
And that's definitely a tough question.

2573
02:44:09,981 --> 02:44:14,960
And I almost replied, no, it isn't good.

2574
02:44:16,790 --> 02:44:18,440
There's nothing good.

2575
02:44:19,310 --> 02:44:19,890
Okay.

2576
02:44:19,890 --> 02:44:20,723
In death.

2577
02:44:25,580 --> 02:44:28,220
And then I started to remember,

2578
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:29,260
okay,

2579
02:44:29,260 --> 02:44:33,220
the people I've lost throughout my life,

2580
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:37,000
the memories of them,
the experiences, the fun,

2581
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:41,290
their unique personalities

2582
02:44:42,470 --> 02:44:43,303
and it,

2583
02:44:43,980 --> 02:44:46,380
everything they'd given me

2584
02:44:48,450 --> 02:44:50,130
not only in their life,

2585
02:44:52,220 --> 02:44:53,480
but in their death,

2586
02:44:57,280 --> 02:45:02,260
what their life taught me and
what they're deaf taught me.

2587
02:45:02,980 --> 02:45:07,880
The mark,
the mark.

2588
02:45:07,881 --> 02:45:10,940
They had left on me and I realized,

2589
02:45:13,390 --> 02:45:14,223
okay,

2590
02:45:14,600 --> 02:45:19,600
I realized that even in death,

2591
02:45:21,170 --> 02:45:21,970
yeah,

2592
02:45:21,970 --> 02:45:26,950
in death there is good.

2593
02:45:30,440 --> 02:45:31,273
First of all,

2594
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:36,340
I was lucky to have that person in my
life even if it was only for a short time,

2595
02:45:38,121 --> 02:45:40,460
too short of a time,
but at least I got that.

2596
02:45:42,230 --> 02:45:45,320
Those unforgettable moments,

2597
02:45:45,321 --> 02:45:47,360
those precious moments,

2598
02:45:49,010 --> 02:45:54,010
at least I got those and
I got to experience those
times to know all the beauty

2599
02:45:57,440 --> 02:46:02,090
of their personality, their
attitude, their outlook on the world.

2600
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:09,560
They were all unique and I'm thankful

2601
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:15,120
for the opportunity that I
had to interact with them,

2602
02:46:15,270 --> 02:46:18,180
even if it was just for
a short amount of time.

2603
02:46:21,890 --> 02:46:24,160
Pin now comes.

2604
02:46:25,230 --> 02:46:25,760
Yeah,

2605
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:26,593
death.

2606
02:46:30,130 --> 02:46:35,130
Death is horrible and death is wretched
and death is cool and Def isn't fair

2607
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:42,540
and I don't know why the best people

2608
02:46:44,510 --> 02:46:48,380
seem to get taken from us first,

2609
02:46:52,540 --> 02:46:53,373
but

2610
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:57,610
the fact is death is inescapable.

2611
02:47:00,190 --> 02:47:02,180
Mm.
There is no way out

2612
02:47:05,960 --> 02:47:10,960
in the death in that death is part of
life and like the contrast between the

2613
02:47:13,811 --> 02:47:17,740
darkness and the light without
death then there is no life.

2614
02:47:21,270 --> 02:47:23,700
Then the people that I've lost,

2615
02:47:27,100 --> 02:47:28,090
they taught me that.

2616
02:47:31,930 --> 02:47:36,550
They taught me how precious life is,

2617
02:47:36,551 --> 02:47:41,551
how blessed we are to have every day to
learn and to grow and to laugh and to

2618
02:47:44,771 --> 02:47:45,850
live,

2619
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:49,953
to live

2620
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:58,200
to a live every day with purpose and with
passion to wake up in the morning and

2621
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:02,620
be thankful,

2622
02:48:04,530 --> 02:48:09,530
thankful for that morning and thankful
for the opportunity to go out into the

2623
02:48:10,021 --> 02:48:13,410
world and live

2624
02:48:17,220 --> 02:48:19,020
to live for them.

2625
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:24,440
For those that don't have the opportunity
for those that were stolen away

2626
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:31,020
by deaths, cruel. Hamed.

2627
02:48:35,350 --> 02:48:36,183
Okay

2628
02:48:36,770 --> 02:48:37,640
for them

2629
02:48:40,870 --> 02:48:42,040
I will live.

2630
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:44,140
Yeah,

2631
02:48:44,140 --> 02:48:48,640
I will cherish their
memory and I will leave.

2632
02:48:53,900 --> 02:48:58,070
So
let's cry no more.

2633
02:48:58,420 --> 02:49:02,270
Let's mourn no more.
Let's remember.

2634
02:49:05,030 --> 02:49:08,340
But let's not dwell instead.

2635
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:15,940
Let's laugh and let's love
and let's embrace and cherish
everything that life is

2636
02:49:16,821 --> 02:49:19,880
and every opportunity it gives us

2637
02:49:24,790 --> 02:49:25,623
live.

2638
02:49:34,830 --> 02:49:39,150
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2639
02:49:40,740 --> 02:49:45,740
Remembering the ones we have lost
by embracing the ones we still have.

2640
02:49:53,560 --> 02:49:56,170
So Devin out there.

2641
02:49:56,770 --> 02:50:01,570
Thank you for embracing us and listening
to what we have to say in supporting

2642
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:05,410

Echo,

2643
02:50:05,411 --> 02:50:10,060

the podcast? The best ways,

much about on it recently,

2647
02:50:23,650 --> 02:50:28,390
but I mean in any kind of depth. But
nonetheless, it's dope. Shroom tech,

2648

you're interested in getting into these

2654
02:50:44,921 --> 02:50:49,000
books that Jucker reviews and you want
to listen to them rather than physically

2655
02:50:49,001 --> 02:50:52,830
read them, you can do it, you know, while
you drive or do yard work or whatever. Um,

We're not gonna run a bunch
of advertisements on here.

2663

We're not going to read a bunch of stuff.
We just need your support.

get a shirt if you like them. Discipline
equals freedom, you know. Good one.

2666
02:51:30,610 --> 02:51:34,570
Speaking of good ones, the good
ones, there's one that good. Anyway,

coffee mug or whatever. Um, yeah.

2669

Or if you're in the mood to donate,
which some people have been doing,

2670
02:51:45,821 --> 02:51:50,260
which is crazy yet very,
I think we're very grateful for that one.

2671
02:51:50,590 --> 02:51:55,330
Hey, hey, donate something, $4
34 cents or whatever. Anyway,

2676
02:52:08,891 --> 02:52:12,160
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2677
02:52:13,290 --> 02:52:16,420
We are also on Facebook and on Instagram.

2678
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:18,610
And you know,

2679
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:23,610
this has been a pretty cool
experience so far in last week,

2680
02:52:25,420 --> 02:52:29,410
this little podcasts broke
into the top 20 on Itunes,

2681
02:52:29,411 --> 02:52:34,360
which was pretty cool of all podcasts.
And that's kind of crazy to see.

2682
02:52:34,361 --> 02:52:37,330
And it's because of you,

2683
02:52:38,710 --> 02:52:42,790
because of you out there listening,
reviewing,

2684
02:52:43,420 --> 02:52:47,170
telling people to check it out,
spreading the word.

2685
02:52:48,190 --> 02:52:52,420
It's you.
You are responsible for all this,

2686
02:52:52,421 --> 02:52:55,660
your questions,
your support.

2687
02:52:57,370 --> 02:53:01,660
So thank you for joining us in this,

2688
02:53:03,220 --> 02:53:05,010
this crazy world we're living in,

2689
02:53:05,050 --> 02:53:08,680
for choosing to fight
instead of surrender,

2690
02:53:08,770 --> 02:53:12,040
for choosing to bring light into
the world instead of darkness,

2691
02:53:12,041 --> 02:53:14,290
for choosing to be
stronger instead of weaker,

2692
02:53:14,410 --> 02:53:17,260
for choosing to get better every day,

2693
02:53:17,380 --> 02:53:19,600
for choosing to live

2694
02:53:20,900 --> 02:53:21,733
every day

2695
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:25,380
by choosing to get up

2696
02:53:27,080 --> 02:53:28,100
and get after it.

2697
02:53:31,370 --> 02:53:36,050
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2698
02:53:38,030 --> 02:53:38,450
out.
