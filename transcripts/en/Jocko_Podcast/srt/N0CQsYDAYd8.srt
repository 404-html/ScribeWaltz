1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,950
The skill itself is being able
to detach during the event,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,600
the Hartford Huston notice,
you got to look for those signs.

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,430
You've got to look for that moment.

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:14,070
When you start feeling emotional or you
know that it's going to be something

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:14,461
emotionally,

6
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:19,461
you've got to step back from those and
get dig yourself in the habit of asking

7
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:24,000
yourself, what do I look like right
now? What do I sound like right now?

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,710
Listen to the words that are coming out
of your mouth and see if you're being a

9
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,080
reasonable human or not.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,620
Look for the emotional quicksand and
don't step in at the emotion of the anger,

11
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:40,650
the frustration. When you start
feeling the sweat beading up,

12
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:45,420
when you start feeling hot, that
should be a big red flag. There it is.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,690
That's the quicksand of emotion.
You don't want to step into it.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,940
Pull yourself back.
