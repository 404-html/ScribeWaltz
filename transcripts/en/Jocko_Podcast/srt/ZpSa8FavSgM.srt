1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,980
This is Jocko podcast
with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,903
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Good Evening Echo and tonight's
podcast is a little bit different,

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,070
but I think it has some
good information in it.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,160
I was asked by two people
who have outstanding podcasts
of their own to sit down

6
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:29,781
and have a conversation about leadership
and specifically leadership inside of

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,400
atrocities,
and when we recorded it,

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,290
I wasn't really expecting it,

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,320
but we decided that we would all
release it on our podcast platforms.

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,310
So the two people that
I recorded this with,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,230
our Danieli Bolelli and Daryl Cooper,

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,370
unfortunately Echo Charles was
not present for this recording

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,030
and Danieli Bolelli. First of
all, he's a history professor.

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,810
He's a martial artist, he's an
author and yes, he's a podcaster.

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,310
He has two podcasts that
are great to listen to.

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,310
The great podcast.
One is called the drunk and towers,

17
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,940
and the other one is history on fire.

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,550
They're great podcasts there, entertaining
podcast, they're educational. They're,

19
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,181
like I said,

20
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:29,100
they're super informative and the
podcast that you're about to listen to is

21
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:31,260
based on a couple other podcasts.

22
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,010
The first one being bye Daniellie from
his history on fire podcast number 32

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,660
Alpha 32 a for civilians out there and
the the podcast is about the sand creek

24
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:51,030
massacre, which took place
in present day Kiowa County,

25
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:54,810
Colorado on November 29th,

26
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,810
1864 where there were about somewhere
between 70 and 170 Cheyenne,

27
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:05,490
Arapaho Indians,
mostly women and children

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,140
who were slaughtered by a 675 man force
of the Colorado us volunteer cavalry,

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,830
brutal situation,

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,110
horrible situation and like I said,
Danieli.

31
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,670
Billy talks about that on his history
on fire podcast number 32 alpha.

32
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,230
The other podcast,

33
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:36,231
this is related to is from Darryl Cooper's
podcasts has his podcast is called

34
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:43,440
the martyrmade podcast and specifically
podcast number 10 it's about the me Lai

35
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:44,274
massacre

36
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,820
and that is when about
500 innocent civilians.

37
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,151
Again,

38
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:56,151
mostly women and children were murdered
and many also raped and mutilated by US

39
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,180
soldiers in Vietnam.

40
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,430
Daryl Cooper is also an
incredible podcast. Her.

41
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,490
He's a great storyteller and
he goes through ridiculous,

42
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:17,470
I would say depths to give all
perspectives of a story. And He,

43
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,960
his podcast martyrmade is fantastic.

44
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:23,230
He doesn't put them out off
as often as I wish he would.

45
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,850
But the podcasts are great.

46
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,610
The one on the Palestinian Israeli
conflict that he started his first,

47
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,760
I think it's his first six podcasts
on martyrmade. That's what it's about.

48
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,680
And they're fantastic.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
And he's a veteran of the u s navy.
He's a wrestler,

50
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,170
he's a Jujitsu player,
and he's really smart,

51
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,960
well read person and great to listen to.

52
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,870
And then the last podcast
is my own podcast,

53
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,980
Jocko podcast number 31
four hours in me lie,

54
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,930
which is when I did an assessment of a
book by that name and talked about that

55
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:03,931
same massacre in Vietnam and in this
podcast that you're about to listen to,

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,920
the three of us discuss how
these atrocities come about
and what can be done to

57
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:19,240
prevent them in the future.
So that's the lay down.

58
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,213
And here it is.

59
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,720
Daniella, Jocko, everybody.
I'm here. Daryl Cooper, uh,

60
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,400
talking to two of my favorite people.
Um,

61
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,630
we're going to go some dark places today.

62
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:35,170
You've listened to the last two podcasts
with Daniella and I have put out and

63
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,750
maybe about 60% of the podcast
that Jocko was put out. And then,

64
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,050
you know, we're gonna we're going
to dive into some dark places. Um,

65
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,340
I want to get it started pretty quick.

66
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:49,210
We've been talking beforehand so
let's just jump right into it. Um,

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,510
Daniella and I recently
did a series that we uh,

68
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,440
cooperated on where he covered the sand
creek massacre in 1864 some US army

69
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:01,270
soldiers, uh, massacred some
native Americans in Colorado. Um,

70
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,310
I did the I massacre,
um,

71
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,200
similar situation 104 years later
in the jungles of Vietnam. Um,

72
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,000
we're fortunate enough to be here with
Jocko. If you don't know who Jocko is a,

73
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:16,300
I guess we'll go ahead and let you
introduce yourself just a little bit.

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,370
Yeah,
my name is Jocko Willink.

75
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:24,371
Guy Was in the military for 20 years
and retired in 2010 and now I written a

76
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:32,351
couple books and have a podcast called
Jocko podcast cause I don't get really

77
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:36,200
creative with the names of things.
So

78
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,440
jacos pretty direct about things.
So I was also kind of humble.

79
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:43,860
Jocko is a navy seal commander in Iraq.
He led taskforce bruiser.

80
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:48,530
Is that right into a task unit bruiser
bruiser into the battle of Ramadi shift,

81
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,710
you know, anything about, uh,
the war in Iraq. You know,

82
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,770
the battle of Ramadi in the battle of
Fallujah are probably the two big fights

83
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:58,070
that get mentioned the most.
We're asked.

84
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:03,071
Volusia was more of an more of a
direct assault on the city after,

85
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,214
uh,

86
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,260
after the insurgence captured and tortured
and mutilated some us contractors and

87
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,910
Bush ordered the Marines to retaliate.

88
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,210
The battle of Ramadi was a
little bit different. Uh,

89
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,910
Jack was going to talk a little bit about
the environment that they went into,

90
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,700
uh, going into it. And so he's
got some military experience,

91
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,910
not only being on the ground,
but of leading men in battle,

92
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,060
in an environment and insurgent war where
you've got different groups of people,

93
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,451
different sex,

94
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:34,250
the Sunni and the Shia Anorak who are
fighting a bloody battle that we're in the

95
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:38,630
middle of, but who we can't engage
with on their level. You know,

96
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,190
these are people who are fighting a very,

97
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,610
very dirty and ugly war against
one another. And against us,

98
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,140
if they get their hands on us as
Americans, I'm going into a war like that.

99
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,310
You know,
we've got,

100
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,730
we've got a different mentality and
we try to avoid behaving in ways that

101
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:56,250
dishonor us. And uh, it's something
that Jocko takes very seriously and he,

102
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,600
he had to lead men into combat under those
conditions. So we can talk about that.

103
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,460
It was 2006, April of 2006 when you
lead, you met into Ramadi to begin with,

104
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:08,750
is that right? Yes, that's what it
was. So, uh, shortly before that,

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,890
a couple months before the golden dome
of the Alis scarred mosque was blown up

106
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,480
by al Qaeda in Iraq.
Zarqawi is people.

107
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,930
This is an ancient Shia mosque,

108
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,530
one of the most sacred
places to s to Shia Islam.

109
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,660
Well, interestingly, Ramadi was,
is primarily Sunni. In fact,

110
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:31,661
it's almost all SUNY and interestingly
the majority of the military forces in

111
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:36,230
Iraq,
especially the army or were Shia.

112
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,210
And so you had to kind of diffuse that
tension on a pretty regular basis to make

113
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,070
sure that there weren't,
you know,

114
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,030
reprisal killings and the,

115
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:52,031
there was definitely some
level of mistrust between
the Sunni's that lived there

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,310
in the city and the Shia military.
But it's definitely, it's,

117
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:03,830
it's absolutely,
it was absolutely clear that the,

118
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,450
the Sunni's that lived in Ramadi,
the local Sunni's that lived in Ramadi,

119
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,110
much preferred the Shia army soldiers
to the insurgents that were there that

120
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:20,090
were being run by al Qaeda in
Iraq by Zarqawi and the likes.

121
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,420
And because what they were doing
was just savagery and you know,

122
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,960
everything that you hear about,
they were skinning people alive.

123
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:34,100
They were beheading whole families. They
were torturing, raping, and murdering,

124
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,130
murdering the local populace in to get
them to support them as much as they

125
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:44,390
could through pure terror.
And so the local populace,

126
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,370
even though they might not
have been, you know, they're,

127
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,770
they're basically going with who's
their worst enemy at the time.

128
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,100
Their worst enemy at the time was
without question al Qaeda in Iraq.

129
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,300
And so the she army that was there to
fight al Qaeda in Iraq, the Sunni's were,

130
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,030
we're generally in support of what
the army was doing there. So it was,

131
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,050
it was a little bit different than an
areas like solder city where the, the,

132
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,200
she is in solder city,
we're very active.

133
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,290
There was an active fight going
on against coalition forces.

134
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,220
So yeah, it's uh, it's
definitely a tricky situation

135
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,510
when you,

136
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,120
when you roll into a situation like that
with American soldiers where both sides

137
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,890
are engaged in just a
hurricane of atrocities across
the country and where the

138
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:32,850
people who are there,

139
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,330
they might be looking to you for safety
or I guess that's a question I would

140
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:39,570
have a, they probably under
the circumstances where
the people in the city,

141
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,520
I mean they probably were
looking to you to protect them.

142
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,000
Absolutely. And just before
we showed up, just to,

143
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,490
just to kind of paint this
as clear as I can and,

144
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:50,090
and I forget the exact numbers
and I apologize for that,

145
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,190
but just before we showed up,

146
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,220
the insurgents murdered,

147
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,420
it was something like seven,
eight,

148
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:04,421
nine 10 of the leading tribal shakes
in the area and the tribal shakes that

149
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,730
survive for that left,
they left.

150
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,900
And so that just put the whole,
the whole city,

151
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,340
you know,

152
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,340
under such a grip of fear
of the insurgents that they
just basically surrendered

153
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,920
as much as you can
surrender, which means, hey,

154
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,680
if you want to come and stay at my house
and you want to sit in my backyard and

155
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:26,090
launch mortars at the coalition forces,

156
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,520
we're not going to say anything to you
because we're going to, we want to live,

157
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,520
we don't want to get killed.
And that's what you end up with.

158
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:34,220
You end up with passive support.
And that's what the locals were doing.

159
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,020
They were passively supporting
the insurgents only because
they didn't want to

160
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:43,760
have their heads cut off.
And so as we,

161
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,780
and this was a brilliant strategy that
was spearheaded by the one one the,

162
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,300
the ready First Brigade of
the First Armored Division
run by a guy named Colonel

163
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,100
Sean Mcfarlin who ended
up being a general,

164
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:59,680
and he's a brilliant guy and a
great leader, but you know, his eye,

165
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,830
his attitude,
which he actually got from HR McMaster,

166
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:08,810
which he had employed up in
California and, and uh, one,

167
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:12,140
one 80 had actually gone into telephone
and gotten a turnover and understood

168
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:15,500
what they had done up and Telefonica and
the strategy was called cs clear hold

169
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:15,920
and build,

170
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,890
which was going to be his enemy controlled
territory's these Enderby controlled

171
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:23,330
neighborhoods and stay there. And so
that's what, that's what the strategy was.

172
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,420
And that was a lot different then the
strategy that had been being used up until

173
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:30,920
this point, not just in
Ramadi button, all of Iraq.

174
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,730
Is that a strategy that it almost seems
like looking at reading about Ramadi

175
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:38,680
from the outside of somebody
who's never been in combat,

176
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,600
it almost seems like the goal was to go
in there and establish your dominance

177
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,290
over the city.

178
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,400
Almost to show the people of the city
that you don't have to be afraid of these

179
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,830
people because they were
afraid of us and we're gonna,

180
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,510
we have freedom in this city.

181
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,740
We can take our Humvees and patrol the
streets and they're not going to come out

182
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,680
and fight us because they're afraid of us.
And so you don't have to fear them.

183
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,630
It almost seems like
that was the goal there.

184
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,390
Yeah. I wouldn't use the word dominance
because we weren't trying to dominate the

185
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,350
local populace. We were trying to provide
security for the local population.

186
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,740
And obviously that's a big difference
because when you start having an attitude

187
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:14,510
of we're going to dominate
the local populace,

188
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,950
that that's just a small step
in the wrong direction. Right?

189
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:21,890
That's a small step in the wrong
direction. Whereas saying, Hey,

190
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:25,550
we're here to protect and secure and
stabilize the local populace, that is,

191
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,200
that is what we were doing.

192
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,320
Yeah. I think it took us maybe a little
bit longer than we wish it would have to,

193
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:36,100
uh, recognize that before you can
do anything counterinsurgency,

194
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,520
you have to provide security
to the people hundred percent.

195
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,770
You're not leaving them a choice,
then they're going to provide that passive

196
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,710
port.
Right,

197
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,070
and I think that's one of the shows that
shows up with the kind of episodes we

198
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:49,580
did. You know both the story of
San Creek and story of me lie.

199
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,030
You have a situation in which sad than
the some guys making to look everybody on

200
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:58,430
the quote unquote other side
as belonging to the same field.

201
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:01,820
The Hawaii because they are all
Cheyenne or they are old Vietnamese,

202
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,630
they are all, there's no signs that
they are not all in the same boat.

203
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,990
Some people are your ally,
some people are your enemies.

204
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,680
Some people are exactly
what you are saying.

205
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:13,130
Stacking between where I kind of
have to cooperate with your enemies,

206
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:16,930
not because I want to buy because I
really have no other choice and you cannot

207
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,050
treat all of them the same way.
And so I think the dilemma you are facing,

208
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,910
this idea of having to figure out,
okay,

209
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:24,770
there are people that worry or to protect.

210
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,450
Those are not the people who going after.

211
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,420
There are other people that
we need to take care of.

212
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,220
That seems to be one of the scenes that
was Betty matched me scene. You know,

213
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:34,851
that nuance,

214
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:38,240
that ability to look at people who may
look the same way but they are not the

215
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,210
same people to look at them
it with different eyes.

216
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,410
That seemed to be really
well was me seeding some of
the stories that we treated

217
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,470
where the guys who did what they did
is because to damn is like an Indiana,

218
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:54,170
he's an Indian, Vietnamese, Vietnamese,
whatever. It's all the same,

219
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:58,130
doesn't really matter.
And I think he's like ow.

220
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:03,131
Do you see one leads to that
point on one side and vice versa?

221
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:07,070
What is the you guys were doing to make
sure that it doesn't go to that point

222
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:11,900
where your guys would not make that
switch to that frame of mind and keeping

223
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:15,690
their priorities very clear in terms of
differentiating in terms of who they are

224
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,100
facing. And real quick,
can I just add up? Yeah.

225
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,580
Supplement to that question because that's
kind of what I wanted to ask as well

226
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,310
as, uh, how do you,

227
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,280
how do you train your men and lead your
men in such a way that they can pull the

228
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:35,260
trigger when they have to and when
civilians get killed on, you know,

229
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:39,370
accidentally that that doesn't
destroy them emotionally. Right?

230
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:43,450
There's gotta be some kind of separation
there without having them fully enter

231
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,920
over into that mindset that Danielle,

232
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:49,060
he's talking about where you're just
dehumanizing the enemy all together when

233
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,160
you have to lead your men in a
situation like that. Like how did did,

234
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,160
how did you deal with that?

235
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,110
Yeah. Well, this is leadership. This is
leadership and this is leadership in war.

236
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,180
And this is, you know, this, this question
that you're asking is the, you know,

237
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,190
one of the largest possible questions
you could ask about combat leadership and

238
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,940
you know, you, you, I appreciate that
you guys keep referring to me, but I was,

239
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,140
I had 35 or 40 seals there
depending on the time.

240
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,440
And there was 5,600 soldiers and
Marines would that were there that were

241
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,400
discriminating targets every single day
and that had outstanding leadership that

242
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:29,690
we're, that we're making sure that
guys with less training than my guys,

243
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:31,040
guys that were younger than my guys,

244
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,450
guys that had a tougher job than my guys
in many cases would still discriminate

245
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,010
targets and make sure that they were,

246
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,360
were engaging enemy
personnel and not civilians.

247
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,100
Now I'm certainly not saying
that civilians didn't get
killed because civilians

248
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:50,930
got killed and it's an awful thing and
it's one of the things I talk about all

249
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:51,230
the time.

250
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,710
If you go to war and you're
not comfortable with the
fact that you're going to

251
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,950
kill innocent people, then you probably
don't have the will to go to war.

252
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,000
And maybe what you're
going to war for isn't,

253
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,290
doesn't meet the threshold
of what warrants a war. And,

254
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,780
and if that's what the conclusion
you come to, that's fine. You know,

255
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,200
let's hope you come to it before you've,
before you've been before,

256
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:14,090
you're on the ground and,
and blood has been spilled.

257
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,720
But there's so many little things to that.

258
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:23,270
Would that would, that, you know,
that we'd cover to talk about, I mean,

259
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:26,540
just even the distinction that I
just made between like, hey, we're,

260
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,290
we're going in there to dominate.
That's a little step.

261
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,240
It's one little step and using
that word and then following it up.

262
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,670
And we talked a little
bit about this and Daryl,

263
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,770
I was listening to your podcast
about the meal. I'm asking her and I,

264
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:42,830
and I did one about it as well. And
one of the things that, that really,

265
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,540
that I talked about in pretty
great depth because for me I had,

266
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,250
I had incredible correlate correlation
between what happened in me life and what

267
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:55,520
I sometimes saw happen overseas.

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,310
And that was with the intelligence
that you're receiving.

269
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,280
And you could see,

270
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,690
and I pointed it out in my podcast and
I don't remember like all the exact

271
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,590
verbiage, but you know, at the
senior levels of intelligence,

272
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,160
the intelligence report was that Pinkville
or the area of Pinkville or me lie

273
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,460
whenever you want to call it me
lie for that, that area, the,

274
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,130
the initial intelligence was,
you know,

275
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:26,590
suspected Vietnamese in
the or suspected Viet Cong,

276
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,520
uh,
area could be possible,

277
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,590
you know,
Vietcong.

278
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,790
And then it went down one level in the
chain of command and the next people that

279
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,480
briefed it, it was just a little
bit stronger. You know, it was

280
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,880
v, you know, Vietcong area,
Vietcong controlled area,

281
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,990
and then it went down one more
level and it was Viet Cong, uh,

282
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,500
headquarters area. And then it
got down to, this is all Vietcong.

283
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,030
And then they threw in the,
the fact that, you know, the,

284
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,160
the, the people go into the market,
right? It's market day. You know,

285
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,970
that started off as, hey, some people
will be at the market on this day.

286
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,290
And by the time it got to the guys on the
ground it was every one that's good is

287
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,190
going to be at the market.

288
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,830
Everyone that's still in the
village is going to be bad.

289
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,570
They're going to be VC and well
you know what to do with VC.

290
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,430
Yeah. What'd he say? He's,

291
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,220
he's really interesting in terms of just
human communication. Oh, in that case,

292
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:30,280
before you even go about
Americans and Vietnamese,

293
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:34,960
you even discuss who are or lead.
Just the basics of human communication.

294
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:39,961
Now sometime [inaudible] one
degree off before you know it,

295
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:41,590
if you keep it long enough,

296
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:45,580
the one degree off to Q so far off course
from the reality they are trying to

297
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:49,480
describe that the awards switch
is kind of like playing telephone.

298
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:51,790
You know when you, we spare
something in the other person's here.

299
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,090
It doesn't sound that different from
what you just heard by you just tweak it.

300
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:58,240
Just a tiny beat by the
time you down 20 people.

301
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:02,020
The message as no similarity
whatsoever to the original one.

302
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,270
And it seems like that as I think we do,
we told the time in daily life,

303
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,750
but nobody dies as a result of it.
Whereas in that Chi kind of scenario,

304
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:11,650
people do die.

305
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,420
The consequences are so much more
dramatic as a result of that.

306
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,460
And what's interesting is,
and Darryl,

307
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:23,960
you kind of brought up in your podcast
and and you did as well, Daniel,

308
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:27,470
is how does this happen?
Right? How does this happen?

309
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:32,471
Because if you take a normal human being
and you drop them into the middle of

310
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:36,920
that thing, they look around and they
go, what the hell is happening? Which is,

311
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,130
which is actually what
happened when, uh, when, uh,

312
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,380
Hugh Thompson came in his helicopter,
he dropped into this situation and said,

313
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:49,130
what the Hell's going on here?
This is totally wrong. Uh,

314
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:53,630
but as you're, as you're getting
there, if you're not on that trip,

315
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,930
if you're not on that train as
it's going off the rails, you,

316
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:57,890
you don't recognize it.

317
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,490
And that's why one thing I talk about all
the time from a leadership perspective

318
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,700
is the ability to detach from all the
chaos and all the mayhem that's happening.

319
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,480
Because if you don't have to,

320
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,380
if you don't have the ability to
detach from that chaos, you're in it.

321
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,660
And if you're in the chaos as a leader,

322
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:16,730
you don't see the mayhem that's happening.

323
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,050
And so it's so important for a
leader in the business world,

324
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,010
but certainly in the military,
to be able or in any leadership position,

325
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,640
to be able to step back and,

326
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,700
and observe what's actually happening
from a detached perspective.

327
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,150
Because otherwise you're in the storm.

328
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,130
And that is not a good
place to be as a leader.

329
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,130
You've got to have rules for how you're
going to behave before while you're

330
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:41,780
going into it. Because
if you just, you know,

331
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:46,520
if you're going to react to everything on
the ground once you arrive, uh, I mean,

332
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:49,700
it's always expedient to just shoot them.
You know,

333
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,720
at the time it's always easier and safer
probably to just do the easy thing and

334
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:59,140
be violent or whatever. So you have
to have rules going into it. Um,

335
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,480
did you have to guess the
one thing that I want,

336
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,730
because the poetry of bidding
stuff is super interesting,

337
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:07,180
but I think essentially what you're
saying is that the person in a position of

338
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:10,750
leadership needs to be as an master.
You know,

339
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:15,190
they need to be in the middle of emotions
that clearly are affecting everyone

340
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:19,360
around them and they are bombarded day
are getting bombarded windows, emotions.

341
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,150
They need to be completely
detached from this stuff.

342
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,960
It makes perfect sense.
Do you do it?

343
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,660
Cause it's a hell of a lot
easier said than done clearly.

344
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,100
And I would do people even
terrain to get to that place.

345
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,250
Well for one thing,

346
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:37,650
when I was running the training
for the west coast seal teams,

347
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,540
I would fire up that training
to a point that it was,

348
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,890
there was total temptation for the
leaders to get wrapped into the scenarios

349
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:48,480
that I was developing for them.

350
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,590
There'd be total mayhem and if they let
it happen they would get wrapped up in

351
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:56,190
these horrible scenarios mentally,
emotionally they'd be mad.

352
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,100
They'd be mad at me cause I was the
guy that was running the training.

353
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:03,180
They'd be mad at the opposing force
roleplayers they'd be mad at their guys.

354
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,610
They'd start yelling and screaming,
they'd make bad decisions and,

355
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,660
and I wanted them to get there because
I wanted them to see what happens when

356
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,880
you get wrapped up in this
stuff emotionally. So,

357
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,710
and then what I would do is teach them
that they have certain what I would call

358
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:20,490
red flags,

359
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,900
certain certain signals that they
need to learn how to pick up.

360
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,780
If you feel yourself
start raising your voice,

361
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,250
well then that probably indicates that
you might get be getting emotional if

362
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,650
you're breathing heavy,
if your fists are clenched.

363
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:38,490
There's all these things that you start
to recognize and once you can recognize

364
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:43,200
them and you say, okay, I'm
starting to get emotional
right now, need to step back.

365
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,430
Now interestingly,

366
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,530
what I would often do an easy methodology
for training these guys was first of

367
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:53,040
all, stop looking down the sights of
your weapon like you're not allowed to.

368
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,890
And we'd give,
we'd give a liter of stick if we had to.

369
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:58,230
And take their guns away so that
they weren't going to be shooting.

370
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,260
They weren't going to be wrapped up in
that tactical situation and literally put

371
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:08,910
that weapon at high port and step
back away from the firing line.

372
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,620
You know Kelly Kelly is with
his m 16 gunning people down.

373
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:18,180
He's completely wrapped up in what's
happening. Medina's yelling and screaming.

374
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,270
I mean I talk about this with,
with police forces as well.

375
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,860
If you want to hear people go,

376
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,220
go listen to some of the bad shootings
that you hear and police have a

377
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,270
incredibly hard job.
They need way more training.

378
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,160
But go listen to some of those shootings
that take place and listen to the pitch

379
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,650
and the tone of the officer if and, and
what are they doing? They're saying, God,

380
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm good to get out there. They're
completely emotional, right?

381
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,340
And that emotion is going to
drive bad decision making.

382
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,070
So you have to learn how to detach.

383
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,300
The way you do it is in a way I would
initially teach guys to do it is by

384
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,150
physically putting their
weapon at high port,

385
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,440
stepping back away from
the actual firing line.

386
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,680
And look moving their head around
and looking around. You know,

387
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:11,330
so Bob Story I wrote about an
extreme ownership is, you know, we,

388
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:15,230
I had w w the, the Delta platoon
commander who's a great guy,

389
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,060
smart guy,
you know,

390
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,500
Ivy League Naval Academy and
just a brilliant guy, great guy.

391
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,570
And he was,

392
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:28,460
we were doing some training and it was
in Humvees and we were doing immediate

393
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,170
action drills and Humvees
here out in the desert.

394
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,350
And your targets pop up and you
engage the target. It's like,

395
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,230
it's like being mini tank commanders and
you've got five vehicles and you've got

396
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:40,250
to maneuver them on the battlefield while
they provide cover fire for each other.

397
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,700
And it's, it's a little bit chaotic.
There's big machine guns shooting. And,

398
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,420
and when I was going with him
and I was sitting behind him,

399
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,280
observing him do this,
and every time the shooting we started,

400
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:54,770
he would kind of lock up, right?
He'd kind of like lock up.

401
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,670
There's so much happening that he
wasn't processing it quick enough.

402
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,530
And so I took a sharpie magic marker
and I, and I, and I wrote down,

403
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,940
um, on the window in front of
his face, I wrote w, Haggai,

404
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,560
here's what I want you to do. And
when, when the shooting starts,

405
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:14,240
I want you to this one,
relax to look around three,

406
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,730
make a call.
And at that time,

407
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,480
I hadn't thought through this stuff as
much as I have now because I've been

408
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:21,530
doing it for much longer.

409
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,310
But what I was telling him to do was
detached from what's happening and,

410
00:25:26,311 --> 00:25:29,580
and the way you do that, as
you relax, you look around and,

411
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,090
and then you get on the, the radio
and you make a call and you know,

412
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,750
the next run I watched him and I'll sit
in behind him and I'm looking over his

413
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,870
shoulder. And once the shooting starts,
you can't hear anything. So I'm just,

414
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,950
just watching him and I,

415
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,100
I see the shooting stars and I see him
look at the window and I seen him take a

416
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,600
deep breath and exhale.
And I was like, okay.

417
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:47,540
He just relaxed and I see his head to
start to turn. And I realize, okay,

418
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,400
now he's looking around and, and, and he,

419
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,430
that those two simple items were enough
to make him detach from all that chaos,

420
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,130
actually assess what is happening
and then make a good decision.

421
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,300
And so that is one of the most important
things that you can train a leader to

422
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:04,340
do.
Sounds like coaching a Jujitsu white belt.

423
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,210
First thing you tell them they're on the
ground getting beat on and they kind of,

424
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,220
first thing you tell him Bri,
Bri relaxed until you can do that,

425
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,300
then nothing's going to work. Yeah, it's
one of those, it's one of those things to,

426
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,050
people talk about like breathing
exercises and one thing that I would

427
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:24,651
instinctively do,

428
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:29,390
and it's another thing that I would train
my guys to do was like you don't panic

429
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:33,320
on the radio. You don't yell on the
radio, you don't scream on the radio.

430
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,640
You no matter what's going on,
when you get on the radio you say,

431
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,390
you know bruiser one six, this is bruiser
over. I mean that's, that's what you do.

432
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,680
And in order to do that,
you have to relax you.

433
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,060
So it forces you, if you're not
going to sound panicked on the radio,

434
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,260
which if you sound panic on the radio and,
and your team hears it,

435
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,310
guess what? You're going to have panic
going on. So you have to, it's another,

436
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,870
it's another method to detach. So when
you hear your voice getting excited,

437
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:04,291
when you know,

438
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:08,010
when you read about Lieutenant Calley
yelling and you hear about Medina yelling,

439
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,810
uh, that, that w, you know,

440
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,780
Kelly started yelling likely
because Medina was yelling at him.

441
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,150
And now that's what happens.
We're just,

442
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,030
we're just sending that panic through
the chain of command and it's a,

443
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:19,320
it's a horrible,
horrible thing.

444
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,980
I think what's fascinating about it is
that parallels even to the scenario you

445
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:24,281
artists,

446
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:28,660
could I be [inaudible] the 99% of the
people at least sitting 99% of the human

447
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:30,970
beings would never have to deal with
because they are never going to be in

448
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:33,880
common. But which bullets flying
all around them and all of that.

449
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,710
And yet it's easy to forget
the deceived dynamics.

450
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:42,930
How do I play in most people lives in
ways that they may be able to recognize in

451
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,670
wheat last six stream, uh, consequences.

452
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:49,510
But like when you're a parent and
you have your kids going wild,

453
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:51,920
then suddenly you find yourself,
you know,

454
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,900
raising your voice and starting
to yell at them and not the cause.

455
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:58,720
I mean there's a time and a place sometime
is the right thing to do is to kind

456
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:00,910
of call them on their stuff in harsh ways.

457
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,350
But there's a difference between raising
your voice with any intent and raising

458
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,770
your voice because you are losing it
and you're getting overly emotional and

459
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:12,930
they're getting angry and Keats realize
it and they way leader you day we had a

460
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,560
CEO,
you are losing your stuff.

461
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:18,730
They will see how you are less of a
credible presence in their life that they

462
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:23,230
know can count on you that way because
you are a it in your own emotions and you

463
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:26,730
know they press the little button and
you go off sometime they'll press that

464
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,120
button because they enjoy seeing you
go off sometimes the, but you know,

465
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,920
the point is you're not
a good leader as a parent

466
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,540
and it's the same thing.
I mean my company now,

467
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:39,920
we work with businesses all over the
world and it's the same exact thing and I

468
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:44,120
teach the same exact thing. If you're
starting to get mad at your employee,

469
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:45,530
you're starting to get
mad at your subordinates.

470
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,210
If you're starting to
get mad at your boss,

471
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,260
what should you be doing as a good leader?
You should be detaching.

472
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,510
Taking a step back, I've told people,
hey, if you start feeling that way,

473
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,630
you stand up from the meeting table. Just
just, you know, no one's going to say,

474
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:00,050
Hey, what are you doing? You
just, you know, stand up,
stretch out, step back away.

475
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,050
These people are having a heated argument
and you start getting involved in it

476
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,380
instead of getting involved in it. Take a
step back. By the way, when you do that,

477
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:09,260
you look like a tactical genius because
everyone else has started to lose their

478
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:11,420
temper. They were starting to say
things that they shouldn't say.

479
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,420
And you're the one that's listening.

480
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,760
I just just covered a
book. Um, and, and just,

481
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:23,540
just like a little thing is if,
if there's, if you're talking,

482
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,590
I'm going to let you talk because if I
let you talk, I know twice as much as you,

483
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,570
I know everything that you know
and I know everything that I know,

484
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,260
so I'm going to win that
tactical situation. Um,

485
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,630
I want to come back to what you were just
saying to Angela about leadership as a

486
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:36,464
parent.

487
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,940
It ties into something he was talking
about a few minutes ago with like a police

488
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,130
officer who's panicking.

489
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,460
We were mentioning this on the car
ride over here about police shootings.

490
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:46,330
Like more often than not,

491
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:50,440
what you see is that they're the result
of incompetence. They're the result of,

492
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,950
um, uh, socially inept cop who
can't manage the situation.

493
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,930
And it's not an easy situation to manage.

494
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:58,930
You've got a potentially dangerous person,
you don't know them,

495
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:02,440
and maybe they're lightly
resisting you just verbally.

496
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,840
And you've got to take control
of that situation. Well,

497
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:09,841
unless you're an exceptionally competent
and confident person may be the only

498
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:14,620
tool you have to bring that person under
control is your baton or whatever it is.

499
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:18,100
And, um, you get the
impression in Vietnam,

500
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:22,030
especially once you get up to 68,
69 where you know,

501
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:25,110
they're starting to just throw junior
officers and right out of, you know,

502
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,620
ROTC and just throwing them
into combat. And you hear, uh,

503
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,270
stories about an
officer's getting fragged.

504
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,140
You start to hear stories about Cali
washed out ocs three, three times, right?

505
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,390
And you,
uh,

506
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,780
you get these people now into a situation
where you have a military unit that

507
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:44,620
recognizes they're incompetent
leadership and they're scared.

508
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,970
They feel incompetent
themselves as a unit. Um,

509
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,920
and you get them into a place where,
uh,

510
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,220
and maybe this is something that you can
contrast really well because you dealt,

511
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,290
you led primarily, uh, seals and marines,
right? Seals joke. It just hits you.

512
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,400
And you worked a lot with marine,

513
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,340
a lot with the marines and army soldiers
as well. Okay. Yeah. And just see,

514
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:08,080
mostly there's one battalion of
marines in inside Ramadi. Okay.

515
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,630
The three, eight marines. Awesome.
When you're dealing with, uh,

516
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,870
the American military today
and, and I know, I mean, um,

517
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,490
something that gets lost on
a lot of people is that, uh,

518
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,330
as highly trained and motivated and all
those things as our special forces are,

519
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,110
um, you know, they're very specialized.
You guys are, you know, trained for very,

520
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:28,420
very specific intense missions and stuff,

521
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:33,340
but you go pull an average ranger or
marine or something or infantry men, uh,

522
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,140
you put them in combat with
good leadership and that
is a unbelievably effective

523
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:41,230
soldier. I mean, American soldiers
today are all volunteer force.

524
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:44,710
These are incredibly well trained
and motivated people if you know,

525
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,680
as if they have the proper
leadership. Uh, when,

526
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:50,230
when you get back into a
situation like that with Vietnam,

527
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:53,410
where you get a whole unit
in that situation that,

528
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,050
that cops in where they're
in maybe a village,

529
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,310
they don't exactly know how to handle
this situation without resorting to lethal

530
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:05,311
force and they start to feel threatened
and everything runs off the rails.

531
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,910
It's, it's unrealistic to
expect just like, uh, you know,

532
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,870
you're happily married man,
and you don't want to cheat on your wife.

533
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,420
Then when you're off on a business trip,
uh,

534
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:20,370
after you've had a few drinks with the
coworker that's on travel with you, um,

535
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,100
it seems innocuous.
Maybe it's totally innocent at the time.

536
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,660
Don't go upstairs to the hotel to watch
a movie because if you get to that point,

537
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,740
you're just putting yourself in a terrible
position. Right. And, uh, and in an a,

538
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,000
in that military context,

539
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:39,001
the idea that all of the built up
momentum behind something like me lie,

540
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,850
the idea that you're going to get right
up to that moment on March 16th, 1968,

541
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:48,851
where the only thing that's stopping it
from happening is a few pounds a trigger

542
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:51,590
pull. That's the last bit of, you know,

543
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:55,910
that's your last opportunity to avert
this catastrophe is just that few pounds a

544
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:58,120
trigger pull. Good luck
with that. You know,

545
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,650
that's something that you
can't let it get to that point.

546
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,040
And that was something that, uh, and
then I'll let you guys take it over,

547
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,240
but I wanted to talk about something that,

548
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,660
it was fascinating to me that you
picked up on as soon as I said the word

549
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,730
establish dominance on
the streets or Ramadi,

550
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:13,970
you reacted against that and you're right.
That's incredibly important.

551
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:17,390
And it ties into what you
were just talking about,
about you would make people,

552
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:17,751
uh,

553
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:21,590
either back away from the situation or
stop looking down the sites of their gun.

554
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,560
Because when you're looking at a
person down the site, so your gun,

555
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,790
it's your framing of the situation and
you haven't put down their gun and now

556
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:32,810
it's just a person. It's not a target.
It's not anything like that. Uh,

557
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:36,590
if you got a bunch of people going into
Ramadi and they're thinking in terms of

558
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:40,460
our job is to go establish dominance
on the streets of this city. Well,

559
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:44,270
you're framing that in a way that under
the right circumstances could, uh,

560
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,380
you know,
lead to trouble.

561
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,680
And so framing it seems like
is what you're talking about.

562
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,430
And,

563
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,430
and I also want to make it perfectly
clear that if the soldiers,

564
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:58,510
marines seals that we work
with in the battle of Ramadi,

565
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,350
if they didn't dominate the
street as we move down it,

566
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,350
you know, we would be just be,
oh, we be killed. So there is,

567
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,580
the job is even harder than I made
it out to say to be because I don't,

568
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,910
I w I wouldn't want to use the
word dominate the city of Ramadi,

569
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:17,140
but you're damn right,

570
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:20,860
we're going to dominate the space that
we go into and we're going to do that by

571
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:22,780
being very,
very aggressive.

572
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:27,070
And so there is this fine line
and by the way, you'd go into a,

573
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,230
you'd kick a kick a door
in, in Ramadi, and there's,

574
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,180
there's gunfire in the
street that you're on.

575
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,070
You'd kick in a door and there would be
a mom and a dad and a couple of kids and

576
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,260
there'd be a normal
household with green grass.

577
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,970
And a soccer balls and that would happen.
That's what the city was filled with.

578
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,360
And so the fact that these guys were able
to flip that switch over and over and

579
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:57,370
over again was, was amazing.
And it's a, it's a testament to,

580
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,820
to the military forces that
we have and to the leadership.

581
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,890
I want to give equal credit to both.
But to your point about,

582
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,680
hey, you know me lie, these were draftees.

583
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:13,830
There was hundreds of thousands of
draftees that went over there and did an

584
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:18,010
incredible job. They were well
led, that stood up when people win,

585
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,300
when the wrong things were happening.
So this was a,

586
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,560
a horrible scenario.

587
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,580
Daniella, let's follow up on
that then. I mean, that's,

588
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,160
cause that's what's the
difference? Like what happens? Um,

589
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,530
you didn't get all the psychopaths in
the army and round them up into one unit,

590
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,940
right? Um, by all accounts,
the guys at me lie, uh,

591
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,470
talked to,

592
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,110
they were the type of people that when
the folks back in Kansas heard about what

593
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:43,471
happened,

594
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:46,350
they couldn't believe that little
Johnny would ever do anything like that.

595
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,100
Same thing at Sand Creek,
right? Same thing. And so

596
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,840
because you're right, we were talking
about this on the way to something today.

597
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,770
It is a for,
we have something like Abu Ghraib happens.

598
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,890
It's a terrible situation.
A lot of bad things went on there.

599
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,400
The idea though that an entire company
of American soldiers would go into an

600
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:10,830
Iraqi village and wipe
out 500 innocent people.

601
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:16,490
That is inconceivable today in the sense
that so many things would have to go

602
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:20,910
wrong and break down and degrade and
degenerate in the American military.

603
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:23,820
For that to have happened that it's just,

604
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:27,990
it seems like a completely
different moral universe and

605
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,460
you look at what the chain
of events that led to me lie.

606
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,880
It was those and if any
of those chain of events,

607
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,780
any anywhere along that chain of events
could have broken that whole chain.

608
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,650
Lieutenant Calley could've gotten killed
when the field and now you could add

609
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:48,210
someone else came in that was a better
leader and didn't have a Napoleon complex

610
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:51,050
and was able to stand up morally
to other people. There's,

611
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,510
there's so many things that
could have changed on that.

612
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,020
You know that could have changed
that whole scenario. The most,

613
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,350
the most powerful one
being a different leader.

614
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,150
It's the same thing at sand creek
different leader that that actually never

615
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:07,170
would have happened, never would have
happened and you that you do see that,

616
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:11,440
you know, you see all the guys on their
side lost soul like you 90 Mozambique,

617
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:14,520
they all agree with team.
Whereas all the guys we achieving United,

618
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:18,510
it's like clearly there's a leadership
element where the average guy in those

619
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:19,344
units,

620
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,680
he's heavily influenced by WHO's setting
an example for them and that sees one

621
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:28,260
of the scenes that interests me about
human nature that you know one of the

622
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:31,200
things cause we were discussing like
does that mean that human being,

623
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,870
you know one of the things too, we had
our loft, these are human beings just TV,

624
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:35,850
gold by nature and he's like,
no they are not evil.

625
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,850
Do Majority of people that are know there
are of course the exceptions that he's,

626
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:42,150
that whatever's mold percentage but the
majority of human beings are not evil.

627
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,200
The problem is that the majority of
human beings, Saturday, extremely easy,

628
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,980
lean for once,

629
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,480
like they're more alcohol and plus can
range in so many different direction that

630
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,360
and they're right.
Leadership Day will be awesome.

631
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,430
Human beings on the wrong leadership.

632
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,810
He's not that hard for them to start
sliding down it really dark direction.

633
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:05,940
So to me it kind of is a method
of weakness more than evil.

634
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,310
You know,

635
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,160
he's not that these guys are a complete
psychopath where you know you haven't

636
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:10,940
been there with diamond,

637
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,730
they are nice people and they yell to the
Old Lady Cross the street and yet the,

638
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,320
the Getty, why did, they
may have good intentions,

639
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,010
good intentions don't go
too far without crazy DC.

640
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,630
Pauline's throng willpower.

641
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:29,690
A lot of the qualities that allow you
to keep it as Gooding tension real and

642
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:34,530
they're heavy emotional thresher where
he doesn't all fly out the window and

643
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:36,010
it's like, I don't know
what happened. I just

644
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,920
lost my mind. Or Hey, they told me
that this was the thing to do when,

645
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:40,330
so I just followed orders.

646
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,070
You know where you have that integrity
to stay present in a crazy situation.

647
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:51,250
You're asking human beings to be kind
of extraordinary in those circumstances

648
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,070
because the ordinary human
being may go down a bad path.

649
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,330
So the antidote in some ways seem to
be to make yourself extraordinary,

650
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,640
to be, to be able to withstand a
kind of situation. And that's where,

651
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,480
and get a,
to lead our,

652
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:08,340
make a huge difference because so many
people would be like flexing the wind.

653
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,010
You know, if the wind is tilting
one way, they will go with it.

654
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:12,880
Even though knowing the
Stilton heavily the other way,

655
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:16,450
they'll also go that route and and
so that what he interests me is,

656
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:21,451
because while a few humans will always
choose a pretty massive upheaval side,

657
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,070
a bunch of humans can go either way.
What he's the shape,

658
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,210
the kind of human beings that we'll be
able to be a great leader or even just

659
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:32,730
for themselves,
even if they are dev,

660
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:37,740
nobody under them just day will make
choices that in an ideal scenario,

661
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:42,580
most human beings would want to make.
What does separate the guy who,

662
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,520
you know, he's sitting there
on on the couch saying, oh,

663
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:48,550
I would beat a guy and a guy
[inaudible] he's that guy.

664
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,540
I think one of the difficulties with that,
um,

665
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,000
is Jocko, you and Jordan Peterson
talked about this and um,

666
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,670
your podcast together.
Um,

667
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,600
you were talking about the book
ordinary men and how, uh, you know,

668
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:08,020
you've got a couple of guys,
group of guys there who are going to,

669
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,640
who are being ordered to do something
that's grotesque and it's not simply a

670
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:14,890
matter of like, you know, that's
a real good situation. If,

671
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:19,390
let's say you are a person of strong moral
character of just all the things that

672
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:20,380
you would want them to be.

673
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,950
You've got two conflicting moral
systems here because you have a duty and

674
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:27,940
obligation to your fellow soldiers who
are going to have to go do this one way

675
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:31,660
or another unless you revolt completely
and then you're betraying your country

676
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:33,880
and there's all these other things that
are brought into it that, you know,

677
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,990
that are moral things.
These are, you know, it's,

678
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:40,570
it's moral to not want to abandon your
friends and your colleagues to have to go

679
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,950
do the hard work that has to be done
so that you can go nurture yourself,

680
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:46,990
righteous sense of personal morality.

681
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,720
Or at least that's the type of thinking
that might go through a person's head.

682
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:49,921
Like,
no,

683
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:54,921
what right do I have to put my own
personal idea of what's right ahead of my

684
00:40:55,721 --> 00:41:00,220
obligation as a soldier ahead of what
my country is telling me to do ahead of,

685
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,413
uh,

686
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,590
just being in there with all of my friends
and fellow soldiers and leaving it to

687
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,210
them. Like that's a moral
thing. And that is a,

688
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:10,830
that is something that you want
people to feel. Right. And I, and I,

689
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:15,820
and I wonder sometimes how much of these
situations are filled with people who,

690
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:19,220
um, you know, maybe 90% of them, the,

691
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,910
the vast majority that
aren't those few evil ones,

692
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,660
they're all kind of looking at each other.
Like maybe inside,

693
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:27,680
they don't necessarily
think this is right. Or B,

694
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:31,660
they don't want to be doing this but
they don't want to abandon their friends

695
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,040
and their friends are looking
at them thinking the same thing

696
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,580
and you just have this vicious
cycle in one of these things. Yeah.

697
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,600
And part of the problem there is the
human willingness to rationalize and make

698
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,150
justifications for oneself. He's
like, well, lean back again.

699
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,060
Cause you know when you look at
the principles that people hold,

700
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:53,690
like what they believe their philosophy
of life is and the way they behave,

701
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,690
even you match more
ordinary circumstances.

702
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:59,150
I mean you made the example of
the cheating husband, right?

703
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,250
How many people seriously believe that
monogamy is the right thing and you don't

704
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:07,610
cheat on your spouse? There will be lots
and lots and lots of people who say,

705
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:11,000
yeah, of course I believe in it. How
many people actually live up to it?

706
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:16,010
And it's like, come on man, that's not
nobody is shooting at you or nobody.

707
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:19,610
There are no, it's a match.
More mellow situation.

708
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,670
And people in many cases can to live
up to their ideals in very ordinary

709
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:25,970
circumstances,

710
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,630
let alone when you start pressing the
buttons and when the circumstances that

711
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,760
are no longer holding area.

712
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,520
But it becomes real panic time and
stress and all of that goes up.

713
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,180
So to me it's like you need to have almost
a maniacal determination to f discord

714
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:46,430
of Condo that you will hold up no
matter what happens. Like I use it as,

715
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,770
it's a joke,
but it is not a joke.

716
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:52,980
Like I use it for daily life as like to
me once I am very few more other roles

717
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,620
that are absolutes. But the ones that
are, there are no exceptions. So for me,

718
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,610
like if you give your word to somebody,
there are no exception.

719
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,080
It's like don't give your word unless you
are 110% sure you are going to keep it.

720
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,940
Don't, I don't mind. You know,

721
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:10,370
we can have a regular conversation
and you don't give your word,

722
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,020
but if you do give your award
to me there is no, oh sorry.

723
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,140
I didn't think in that situation
are there was that exception to me.

724
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:21,350
The only way you apologize is
a summer I style, you know,

725
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:24,860
you stick a knife in your belly and use
lives back and forth. That's how you say,

726
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:29,260
sorry. There is no exception to that.
It's almost as if, uh, you have the,

727
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,330
that those rules serve as Paul Stars.
When you're in a situation,

728
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:33,620
it's as chaotic as something like,
yeah.

729
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,710
Combat where you have to
have a few rules that,

730
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,610
I mean maybe there are arbitrary
but you'll die for him. Yeah.

731
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,760
Because when you're in the midst of a
situation that is completely outside the

732
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:48,290
realm of your normal experience, uh,
they give you reference points, you know,

733
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:48,620
they get,

734
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,610
they structure the situation a little
bit for you so you're not just lost in

735
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:56,570
chaos. There's some structure to it and
then you can evaluate the rest of the

736
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:59,510
environment relative to those hard
and fast rules that you've got.

737
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,070
Because in the situation,

738
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,730
you know when you're in me lie and you're
one of the people who's kind of on the

739
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:06,740
fence,
but now people are shooting,

740
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:10,340
that is not the time to have
this argument with yourself. No,

741
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:13,760
that's not when you're going to
figure it out. Yeah, for sure. Well,

742
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:18,140
this might sound really obvious and it is,
it's a very simple,

743
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,330
obvious answer to this really,

744
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:24,950
really hard question of how do you
prevent this thing from happening or who's

745
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:28,160
the kind of person that will stand up?
And the answer is it's actually,

746
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:32,280
it's quite simple. It's training
and education, it's training

747
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,113
and education.

748
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,240
And if people understand that these kind
of things can happen and they get put

749
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:43,410
in these pressers situations and they
get trained and they get debriefed on

750
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:47,550
mistakes that they made and they saw that
they got emotional and you train them

751
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,384
correctly,

752
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:53,660
well then you've got someone who gets
into a me lies situation and says to

753
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:59,120
themselves, wait a second,
we're not getting shot at
right now. Cease Fire. And,

754
00:44:59,121 --> 00:45:02,760
and that was the most incredible thing
about that story is that's all it took

755
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,630
was a one leader to say, hey,
stop killing people. And they,

756
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,490
they literally stopped at that moment.

757
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:14,330
So training people and putting them in
these situations and educating them so

758
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:19,650
that they understand so that
they have pattern recognition,

759
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,380
training them so that they
can learn how to detach,

760
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,500
training them so that they can
control their emotions, training them,

761
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:29,610
that they can see when horrible
things are unfolding before them.

762
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,990
And then how the big, they can put a
stop to them. That is what is important.

763
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,720
And as you mentioned, Daryl, as the,

764
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,920
as the Vietnam War drove on, that the
training got less and less than that.

765
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,000
The officers were getting sent over
quicker and quicker and you're getting on

766
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:46,610
the job training and the
person that you're getting on,

767
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,800
on the job training from is a person
that's only been doing it for two and a

768
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:53,790
half months longer than you. And
that's, that's how these things occur.

769
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,380
So you have to invest in, in, in people
that are going to be in these situations.

770
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,050
And it's the same thing again.
I tell this to businesses all the time,

771
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:05,910
have you done, you know, on a
construction site, have you done a drill?

772
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,270
If you have a mass casualty,
w do you know what,

773
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,220
you know where you're going to
call in casualty evacuation?

774
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,870
Do you know we're getting
into what the air,

775
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,060
air flight are a life flight numbers?

776
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:18,600
Does anyone have the life flight number
here? Because if someone gets hurt,

777
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,050
you need to make that call. And do you
know what station you're going to call,

778
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,210
what helicopter you're going to call?
Do you know where they're going to land?

779
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,190
Why would you not run those things?

780
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,830
And if those things unfold and
you're not prepared for him,

781
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,731
you're going to fall apart.

782
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:34,731
And it's the same thing with these
ethical and moral situations where if you

783
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:39,150
don't understand what they are and you
don't understand what can go wrong,

784
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,910
you're gonna have,
you're gonna have a bad day.

785
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,350
And I felt he was,

786
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,220
but he didn't know what you brought up
a little bit ago when you said that are

787
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,650
steps along the way that long
before the crisis manifest itself,

788
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,480
there's that ability to recognize the
tiny little steps that are leading there.

789
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:00,550
Now when you look at the tiny thing,
it looks tiny.

790
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,270
It doesn't look like a big deal.
That's no crises that it's not a problem,

791
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,920
but he's that first step that's taken
you down that path and it's a lot easier

792
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:11,680
to stop it early then when crisis is on.

793
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,120
And so in that sense that does become
a training that does become a thing of

794
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:17,920
like how do you recognize the steps,

795
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:21,070
how do you work on it and you know you
are saying seeing so like even something

796
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:25,390
as magic I hey buddy to one second. Take
one second to breathe before you react.

797
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,710
Then seeing how you want to react is
the same thing that applies everything.

798
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:31,240
It applies to conversational.

799
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:34,480
When people are people you care
about maybe are getting you angry.

800
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,370
Do you really want to respond right
away or maybe take 30 seconds to take a

801
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:42,130
breath, then decide how you
want to respond. You know,

802
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:47,530
and I think he's like to me is we are as
silly as that he is because you don't,

803
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:51,240
clearly war and [inaudible] are very far.
You will.

804
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:54,220
You've ever seen so many ways but
to me as being one of the seat,

805
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,610
if I didn't go to it's,
I guess you're right,

806
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,090
but I guess to me has
been one of the most,

807
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:06,270
and for giving me or ours that added I
ever had poutine front of me was seen our

808
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:11,650
why or react under extreme stress
when you haven't slept for two days.

809
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:16,150
When somebody is throwing a fee to that's
completely unjustified when and said

810
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:17,090
that he's like, yeah, you have a little,

811
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,440
the good reasons to be mad by
really this is how you respond,

812
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,700
this is how you will react to a four
year old kid was just being a 40 year old

813
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:29,460
kid and you get all emotional and do
study island and suddenly like 10 Saquon

814
00:48:29,461 --> 00:48:33,980
seemed to me blow it up. I see myself
from the outside and I'm like, um,

815
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,260
every scene that I despise in this moment,

816
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:40,130
you know that man right there that's
responding their way as all the reasons as

817
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,440
older. I can see why that hasn't met
that you still don't do it, you know,

818
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,100
and radar than just being like,
okay, let's wait for myself.

819
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:50,890
I'm a horrible human being. I
discovered that. He's like, okay,

820
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,950
what can I do now to get the or
next time you got real world world

821
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,270
training,
right?

822
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,630
Because now you recognize the situation
and now you don't let it happen anymore.

823
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:04,400
Exactly. You know, I had, I was talking
to you guys earlier, we, I hit it,

824
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,370
my first deployment to Iraq,
we went and hit a target and,

825
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,090
and it sounds almost like, you know,
like what you'd imagine in a movie.

826
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:15,440
We'd get handed a map then on the map
and to be a city block and Baghdad and

827
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:19,580
there'd be a red x on one of the
buildings and that's all I needed. Oh,

828
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,230
you want me to go hit that red x?
Cool.

829
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:26,120
We'll go hit that red x and one
night we went and hit, you know,

830
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:29,480
the building with the red x on it.
And when we hit the target,

831
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,590
it was like the most normal
family you could ever imagine.

832
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,400
And as we started talking to them and
we had our interpreter get in there and

833
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:40,430
figure out, you know, hey, do you know
who this person is? Were like, yeah,

834
00:49:40,431 --> 00:49:42,350
he lives two doors down. Oh, okay.

835
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,510
And so then I went back and eventually
said to myself a question that if I

836
00:49:47,511 --> 00:49:50,480
wasn't, if I had more experience, I would
have asked this question for me. I said,

837
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,170
Hey, I've got a question. Who put
that red x on that building and why?

838
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,390
And as I pulled the string
on it, it, you know,

839
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,980
it was one of those things where they
had gotten some Intel, which, you know,

840
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:07,070
I won't talk about where it came from,
but it was, it was intel that, you know,

841
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,480
put it in that general vicinity and
they like pick the center of the general

842
00:50:11,481 --> 00:50:11,931
vicinity.

843
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:15,350
There's the center of the genitals
and either they will put the x and no

844
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,070
followup. And so I always taught
that as something, hey guys,

845
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,920
make sure you know who's giving
you this intelligence. And that's,

846
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,670
that's the case that happened to me. Lie
where the f the person on the, no one,

847
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:30,260
no one at the platoon said,
hey, whoa, hold on a second.

848
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:35,290
Who's who's confirming that
this is 100% VC in this village?

849
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,930
Our hunch, you're telling me
this is 100% VC in this village.

850
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:42,290
That's what we're saying right now.
Who's talking, who's saying that?

851
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,520
I want to talk to that person.

852
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,820
And that's another thing I talk
about all the time is you don't,

853
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,430
as a leader, you don't want
to be surrounded by yes men.

854
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,070
You don't want to be surrounded
by yes men. And you know,

855
00:50:54,071 --> 00:50:56,440
we're talking about the horrors of
Vietnam War and I'm reading another book

856
00:50:56,441 --> 00:51:00,400
right now and there's a platoon
commander and his guys are going there.

857
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:05,170
They're rotating between three locations
and two of the locations are not too

858
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:09,820
bad. The other locations is
a nightmare. It's, it's, it's
Vietnam War. Stereotypical,

859
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,670
it's booby traps,
snipers and indirect fire.

860
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,740
They never see the enemy.
They just never see the enemy.

861
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:22,780
And all they do is they go out there
on patrol and they get blown up,

862
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,380
they get shot, they get mortared and
they never see the enemy and the guy,

863
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,750
the guys are getting wounded or killed.
And

864
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:30,730
okay,

865
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,270
as you think about that,
I would,

866
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,660
I would pray that if I was the company
commander or the battalion commander,

867
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,650
that that platoon commander would
come to me and say, Hey Jocko,

868
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,540
this is stupid.

869
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,690
Let me tell you how many people we've
lost so many time and the other,

870
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,910
the platoons of lost. And let me
tell you what we've gotten out of it.

871
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:55,700
We've got nothing out of it and we,

872
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,070
we need to stop this or we need
to find a better way to do it.

873
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,880
If you want to send us in there, let us
set up a strong point. Let us set up a,

874
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:04,520
a bunkered position and we'll stay in.
We'll observe,

875
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,130
but us just walking around in
there waiting to get blown up,

876
00:52:07,131 --> 00:52:10,520
makes no sense whatsoever.
Please, let's do something else.

877
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,540
And as a leader you have to
have the open mind to say, okay,

878
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:19,040
I thank you, I appreciate that
feedback. What are your suggestions?

879
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:21,740
You've been in the area of operations.
How do you recommend we do it?

880
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:27,250
And whenever I hear these stories of
guys that get put in really terrible

881
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:30,560
situations in the military,
it, it sickens my heart.

882
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:35,450
Because what you need is a culture inside
any organization. The military, yes,

883
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,410
but any organization of people to raise
their hands and say, Hey, wait a second,

884
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,360
this is stupid. Hey, wait a second.

885
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:46,010
Do I not see an American flag on that
Indian reservation with a white piece flag

886
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:49,520
underneath it and wait, wait, hold
on. Stop. Why wait, wait, stop.

887
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,950
And that takes moral courage.

888
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:57,310
It takes training and it takes a culture
inside an organization to stop people

889
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:58,640
in question what they're doing.

890
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,580
And it takes a certain level of
detachment that you were talking about.

891
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:04,050
It absolutely takes detachment.
You know, it's like, uh,

892
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,950
you were saying about like dealing
with a four year old or something.

893
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:10,910
Like when you're in the middle
of it. Yeah, it's seems normal.

894
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:14,130
It seems like the way to behave and it's
only when you step back and say, well,

895
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,580
you know,
uh,

896
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,760
one of the things about human beings are
great strength I suppose is that we're

897
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:21,590
supremely adaptable creatures.

898
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:26,220
I was talking to a psychologist one time,
used to work for the State Department

899
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,730
and he would, uh, he worked in
Africa for awhile. He talked about,

900
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,980
he was telling me some of the stuff that
he would encounter whole villages, um,

901
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:37,230
where every woman had been raped 10 times,
uh,

902
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:40,350
over the years where kids in this village,
she had watched their parents killed.

903
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:43,950
Just horrifying stuff.
And my question to them at the time,

904
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,710
cause he was a psychologist,
uh, was, I mean,

905
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:51,711
how are these people not just completely
blown out with Ptsd and everything

906
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:52,591
else?

907
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:56,340
Like how are they functional at all
given what we know about Ptsd and how it

908
00:53:56,341 --> 00:54:00,240
does function under circumstances
that are far less severe than that.

909
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,030
And that's what he said. He said,
you'd be surprised. Humans are very,

910
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,730
very adaptable into them.
This is their environment.

911
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,550
And that can work the other
way too though. You know,

912
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:11,750
that can work in the
direction of, uh, the,

913
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,130
in the new Ken Burns Vietnam documentary,
which is just,

914
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,320
I don't know if you've watched it yet.
Uh,

915
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,590
the progress I think the
first two episodes. Okay.

916
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:24,540
So one of the ones you're coming
up on, uh, the name of it is,

917
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:28,500
this is what we do and it starts out
talking about this get new recruit and he

918
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:32,130
shows up to this place and like the
first thing he sees when he gets to a,

919
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:35,460
the base cities at,
it's not a mask or anything like that,

920
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:38,380
but it's just sort of a, you
know, a Vietnamese prisoner or,

921
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:41,350
or a captive being led along by,
you know,

922
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,640
a corporal or something and he's just
being rough with them and kind of push

923
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:48,060
them along and doing stuff that
clearly is outside of regulations.

924
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,690
And this new guy shows up and he's like,
Hey,

925
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,890
like you supposed to be
doing that or whatever it is.

926
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,030
And the first thing he hears when he gets
over there, his kid, this is Vietnam,

927
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:57,930
this is what we do.

928
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,680
And he said that their whole rest of
the time that he was there when he saw

929
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:04,890
something he didn't like when he was
doing things that he wasn't sure about,

930
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:08,340
he just repeated in his head, this
is Vietnam, this is what we do,

931
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,390
this is what we do. And after awhile
he didn't have to repeat it anymore.

932
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,890
After a while, that was his environment.
And you know, it reminds me,

933
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:18,630
I used to have these recurring dreams.

934
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:21,120
I probably shouldn't share
this on the air, but, um,

935
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,380
I used to have these recurring dreams. I
still have him every once in a while. Uh,

936
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,340
the details and the setting differ,
but um,

937
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:32,390
it'll be something like the dream starts
and I'm in like a helicopter say and

938
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:37,560
I'm flying around like a city like la
or wherever and I'm just shooting people

939
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:40,560
like grand theft auto. It's just like a
video game Tryna Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

940
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,240
And I'm going through
and I'm doing all this.

941
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:43,320
Sometimes there's people down there,

942
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:45,960
I know my friends and
stuff and it's just all,

943
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,710
it seems just like I'm in a video game.
And then the way the dream goes,

944
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,770
is it a certain point after
a few minutes of this,

945
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,670
all of a sudden it hits me what
I'm doing and I look around and I,

946
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,130
it's almost as if I wake up in
the dream and I'm like, oh my God,

947
00:55:59,131 --> 00:56:01,530
like I'm killing all these
people. What, what am I doing?

948
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,890
But at the time it was completely normal.

949
00:56:04,891 --> 00:56:08,760
It seemed exactly like this is just what
I should be doing or anything like that.

950
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,370
And that's something that I think that is,

951
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,360
well it's why you told people stop looking
down the barrel of your gun. You know,

952
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:18,870
you got to step back and be able to get
that distance so you can change your

953
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:21,390
frame. And again, with the proper training

954
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,400
and the proper education,

955
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,700
you will know as a leader that
that behavior will escalate,

956
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,570
that behavior will escalate.
And if you allow it to happen,

957
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,570
it will continue to get worse.
And so it starts off,

958
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:41,560
and I've read all kinds of books about,
about Vietnam,

959
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,940
especially about Vietnam, where it
starts off, it starts off with, hey,

960
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,780
the villagers are, we kind of know them,
everything's cool, give them lollipops,

961
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,710
but then you know, one of
our guys dies and then, well,

962
00:56:52,711 --> 00:56:54,410
we're not getting lollipops.
As a matter of fact, we're,

963
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,850
we're kicking the kids away and,
and it, it only escalates to their,

964
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:02,050
and it escalates to
murder and it escalates.

965
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,570
Or I should say this,
it can escalate.

966
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,520
It doesn't automatically escalate because
all it takes is someone to step in and

967
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:13,330
say, Hey, no, that's across the line. But
you know what? You want to slap a guy.

968
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,830
I get it, I get it. But that's the line.

969
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,710
Anything once, you know, one
thing that we used to say,

970
00:57:20,711 --> 00:57:24,250
and I used to tell my guys
once the cuffs are on somebody,

971
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:26,020
so once we get somebody
zip-tied it's over,

972
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,980
but you do what you gotta do to get a
guy under control. Once there's uptight,

973
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,080
it's done. And now they're, they're,

974
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,540
they're getting taken care of and
you, you treat them firm, but fair.

975
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,100
That's it. And so those lines, you,

976
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:43,850
you have to draw them and you have to
hold the line as a leader because things

977
00:57:43,851 --> 00:57:44,684
start escalating.
You know,

978
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,170
the thing that you were asking
me about earlier about the, the,

979
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:50,450
the Chechen war and the Russians
against the Chechens and it's,

980
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,160
they didn't, they didn't hold
the line with the little things.

981
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,480
And that when you lose that discipline,
even up on the smaller things,

982
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,530
well eventually then you don't have
the discipline on the bigger things.

983
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,990
Can you go overboard
with that? Yes, you can.

984
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:08,230
I can hold the discipline so hard on the
little things that no one listens to me

985
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:09,064
on the big things.

986
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,560
That's why leadership is hard because
there's a dichotomy there that you have to

987
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:15,520
balance. You can't be freaked out
because, you know, you didn't,

988
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:20,380
you didn't blouse your boots when you
were supposed to, but at the same time,

989
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:25,540
if I start to let too many things
slide well it will escalate.

990
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,510
And it seems like maybe
with things like that,

991
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,190
a lot of people who were civilians,
they, they laugh when I see in movies or,

992
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,590
uh,
you know,

993
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,320
TV shows or something about how soldiers
in combat are still expected to groom

994
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:37,921
themselves.

995
00:58:37,921 --> 00:58:40,830
They're still expected to take care of
themselves and comport themselves in a

996
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:43,950
military way.
And what I tell him a lot of the times is,

997
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,370
and maybe you can confirm this because
I don't really know what I'm talking

998
00:58:47,371 --> 00:58:51,540
about, but it is that, uh, you
know, my, my feeling on, uh, on,

999
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:56,541
on why that stuff is so
important is that you can't have,

1000
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,890
uh, you know, you can't have Iraq in
the sectarian war and all the stuff,

1001
00:59:01,891 --> 00:59:03,570
the storm that's going on around them,

1002
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:07,500
you can't have that become the
environment to which they're adapting the

1003
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:10,320
environment to which they need to
be well adapted as the u s military.

1004
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,380
That's their environment.
That's what they're focused on,

1005
00:59:13,381 --> 00:59:15,810
following these rules
and behaving in this way.

1006
00:59:15,811 --> 00:59:17,940
And then when that's their environment,

1007
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:20,010
they can go into these
places and do their jobs.

1008
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,390
If they get in there and start reacting
to what's going on around them.

1009
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,680
Because I mean, you then you can tell
a guy talking about going native,

1010
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:33,280
native, you know, once a it's
apocalypse now, you can tell a guy, uh,

1011
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,350
once the cuffs are on.
Uh, but you know, if,

1012
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:40,790
if I was talking to a family yesterday
and this is the guy that just cut their

1013
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:45,650
heads off, well, I mean, you know,

1014
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:47,150
you,
you can't have,

1015
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:51,260
you can't put yourself in a situation
because it does make sense to beat the

1016
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:51,951
shit out of that guy.

1017
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:54,920
It does make sense to put a bullet
in his head when the cuffs are on,

1018
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:58,110
like from a, even from a moral
standpoint in certain ways like that,

1019
00:59:58,111 --> 01:00:00,980
you can justify that, you know? Um,

1020
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:05,150
and so that's why you can't be reacting
to whatever it is that's going on.

1021
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,070
And it sounds like that's
kind of what you're saying.

1022
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:11,100
Yeah. And there's actually an interesting
dichotomy there as well, because

1023
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,260
you, you need to follow the rules, right?

1024
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,410
Because if I told, if the
three of us decided, hey,

1025
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:23,910
we're going to go on this village raid
and we're all going to use our morals as

1026
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,880
our guide, well we have three
different scenarios. You're,

1027
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,450
you just admitted that you'd be execute
and somebody that was already handcuffed,

1028
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:34,650
uh, who knows what you'd be doing, you
know, I don't even want to know. Right.

1029
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:37,830
And so, so we were all over
the map, right. Maybe you're,

1030
01:00:37,831 --> 01:00:39,190
maybe you're saying you're,
you're not even going to,

1031
01:00:39,191 --> 01:00:42,000
I don't even want to handcuff anyone
cause you think that's too offensive and

1032
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:45,570
I'm somewhere in the middle. Whatever
the case may be, we're all over the map.

1033
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,550
So I would always tell the guys,
look, you need to do what is legal,

1034
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,170
what's legal?

1035
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,450
But then the paradox of that is sometimes
what you can get away with the legally

1036
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:01,230
still isn't the right thing to do.
And that's again,

1037
01:01:01,231 --> 01:01:03,390
that's why there's a dichotomy
between those two. Between,

1038
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,020
do I follow the rules exactly. Or I
mean, you know, look at, look at me.

1039
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,620
I look at Sand Creek that
my boss told me to shoot.

1040
01:01:10,621 --> 01:01:13,260
This guy told me to shoot
this three year old baby.

1041
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,600
My boss told me to do that. I'm,
should I be following orders?

1042
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:22,170
Is there a threat that I don't know
about? You know, these days, you know,

1043
01:01:22,171 --> 01:01:26,970
I've heard a lot of stories now the
guys that that took down Mozel right?

1044
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:29,160
The,
the enemy was sending,

1045
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:34,340
surrendering children to come
and surrender to coalition
forces and they would

1046
01:01:34,981 --> 01:01:39,000
be strapped with a ID vests,
suicide vests,

1047
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:44,340
and over and over and over again, it was
our US military, you know, especially our,

1048
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:48,720
our explosive ordinance disposal folks
and that we're going in disarming these

1049
01:01:48,721 --> 01:01:52,200
bombs on these kids.
But yeah,

1050
01:01:52,201 --> 01:01:57,201
how do you feel after you see two or
three of those little kids get killed plus

1051
01:01:57,481 --> 01:02:00,900
two or three EOD guys get killed and
now you're going to fight those guys and

1052
01:02:00,901 --> 01:02:03,390
they want to surrender.
That's a very challenging thing.

1053
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,980
And if you don't maintain discipline,
it's a slippery slope.

1054
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:11,860
And it's funny because we're saying
to seeing said the same time,

1055
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:15,760
which sound contradictory and yet that's
life that on one end you need to have

1056
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:20,340
this super strict rules. They are not
going to bend under circumstances.

1057
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,570
And on the other end,

1058
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,840
your thing that you rightly point out
too is the fact that Rhea leadership is

1059
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,320
also the ability to think on your feet.
And no two situations are alike.

1060
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:31,880
So the rule for loin approach,

1061
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:36,270
while he may save you from some of the
worst abuses is not always necessarily

1062
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:37,071
the right thing.
And there,

1063
01:02:37,071 --> 01:02:41,880
there's also the time when we all lost
follow the rules except when we don't

1064
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,920
because that's the one
time when it's correct.

1065
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:47,130
And that ability to make the
right call at the right time,

1066
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,780
that's what make you an extraordinary
already in our human being.

1067
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:54,400
We're just sort of in debates are
popping off at the mouth today. Yeah,

1068
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:58,290
we sort of take for granted that the
whole, um, I was just following orders.

1069
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:00,720
Question was settled at Nuremberg.
It was not settled at all.

1070
01:03:00,721 --> 01:03:03,870
That's an incredibly complicated
question for just the reason you were

1071
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:05,580
describing. You know, uh,

1072
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:10,170
somebody who worked at a Nazi death camp,
um,

1073
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:11,190
you know,

1074
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:15,870
they didn't make 10,000 independent
decisions to kill somebody.

1075
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:21,060
Uh, they made one decision that their own
personal moral compass was going to get

1076
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:24,630
outsourced to the state and that they
were going to do their duty and follow

1077
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:27,030
their orders.
They made that decision once and now,

1078
01:03:27,031 --> 01:03:29,880
once you've made that decision and
you've outsourced your moral compass,

1079
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:30,714
which again,

1080
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:36,410
under most circumstances that might be
the thing that keeps you from doing the

1081
01:03:36,421 --> 01:03:39,870
wrong thing now might be the thing that
keeps me from executing that. You know,

1082
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:40,710
I'll kind of guy.

1083
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:44,610
But when the institutions themselves
start to get warped or if you're in, even,

1084
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:49,380
even if the institution is an individual
unit or something, you know, uh, it's,

1085
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,130
uh, I can't remember where
I heard it, but there's a,

1086
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,220
some zoologist or somebody who
pointed out to him that, uh,

1087
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:01,340
he had asked why zebras have black and
white stripes when the grass is gold

1088
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:04,530
colored in yellow and they
don't blend into that at all.

1089
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:05,820
Clearly Tigers can see that.

1090
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,790
And he pointed out to him that that
camouflage isn't to blend into the

1091
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:12,600
environment. That camouflage
is to blend in with each other.

1092
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:17,010
They blend with the herd.
And so the Tigers have a
difficult time tracking down,

1093
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:20,820
like in focusing on an
individual. And uh, they, oh,

1094
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:24,000
they figured that out because they
wanted to try to put ear clips on them or

1095
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:25,260
something to track these things around.

1096
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,840
But they noticed every time they put
something identifiable on one of them,

1097
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:28,770
the Tigers would kill it.

1098
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,270
And it was because now they had something
to focus on it. So, and that's, you know,

1099
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:35,790
I'm not making a literal
evolutionary comparison here,

1100
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:37,950
but there's an interesting like,
just sort of analogy,

1101
01:04:37,951 --> 01:04:40,890
which is this instinct to
blend in with the herd.

1102
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:45,810
There's just their safety there. There's
a sense of security there and there's,

1103
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:50,811
there's virtue in for fitting a certain
amount of your personal judgment to the

1104
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,280
group to which you have obligations.

1105
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:56,020
That's a good thing under most
circumstances. You know what I mean?

1106
01:04:56,060 --> 01:05:00,400
At least in a lot of
circumstances. You know, that's
what duty is. That's what, um,

1107
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,640
you know, just fulfilling your obligations
to your people or you, you, you,

1108
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,880
your unit or something. Like, who are you?

1109
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,050
Especially if you're an 18 year old
kid who just got out of high school and

1110
01:05:10,051 --> 01:05:13,440
you're over there and you're in a
situation where you've got, you know,

1111
01:05:13,441 --> 01:05:17,530
like in me lie, you've got
officers, you've got uh, you know,

1112
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:18,940
not just your immediate officer,

1113
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:21,940
but it seems to be being reinforced
by your captain above, you know,

1114
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:25,120
your company commander at the
time, and me lie, there was a,

1115
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:29,470
there was a major general in a helicopter
observing, buzzing around that place.

1116
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,910
And so, you know, you're in a situation
where you say to yourself like,

1117
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,390
who am I to say that what's
going on here is wrong?

1118
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:42,130
It seems wrong to me because of what
I learned from my Mama or whatever.

1119
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,120
But you know what, what does that mean?
I've got a captain, I've got a lieutenant,

1120
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:50,110
I've got my sergeant's, I've got this
major general in the air. And you know,

1121
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:54,590
maybe I'm wrong, maybe this,
you know, I just got here
four months ago. This was my,

1122
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,440
this is a Charlie company's first major
combat operation is it really hadn't

1123
01:05:59,441 --> 01:06:01,390
made contact,
direct combat with the enemy.

1124
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:05,020
And this is the first time any of them
have seen combat for the most part.

1125
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:08,470
And I think it's uh,
um,

1126
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,200
there's certainly a certain amount of
weakness that's involved like you were

1127
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,034
talking about.

1128
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:15,810
But I also think there's a certain amount
of moral confusion that happens and

1129
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:18,490
that's, that's, there can't
be that kind of confusion.

1130
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:20,980
Like that is where leadership
has got to take over.

1131
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:25,270
I can add another layer of complexity
to this. Okay. So, so first of all,

1132
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,680
I do think that the,
well Napoleon said,

1133
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,950
if you execute an order
that you know is wrong,

1134
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,410
and when he was talking about he's not
talking about something that moral,

1135
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:35,891
he's talking about,

1136
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,550
if I do something where a bunch of my men
get killed because the general said to

1137
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:42,850
do it and I do it, I'm
culpable. So that's,

1138
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,900
that's pretty clear that if your boss
tells you to do something that you know is

1139
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:50,650
gonna in Napoleon's case it was getting
a bunch of your guys killed then,

1140
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,500
then you say no. And if you do it,
you're called Bobo for what happens.

1141
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,880
You could say the same thing.
If,

1142
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:58,900
if I get told to do something
that's morally or ethically
wrong and I do it well,

1143
01:06:58,901 --> 01:07:01,600
guess what? Then I'm
responsible for that. What?

1144
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:06,630
What becomes a little bit complicated to
me or adds another layer of complexity

1145
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:07,534
is this,

1146
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:13,330
if I'm going to sand creek and I'm with
Chington and he or she havington and he

1147
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:17,590
says, um, hey, we're going to go there
and we're going to execute this and we're,

1148
01:07:17,591 --> 01:07:19,750
we're, we're going to kill
these guys. We're going to,

1149
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:24,340
we're going to conduct a raid
and I don't believe in it.

1150
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:28,120
Okay? So I say, you know
what? I don't believe in it.

1151
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:29,380
I don't think it's the right thing to do.

1152
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:32,260
I think that we've made enough peace
with them. We've caused enough problems.

1153
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:35,170
That's their land. I'm not going, okay,

1154
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:38,110
so now you don't go because you
didn't believe in the mission.

1155
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,850
Well now who's out there
conducting the mission?

1156
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:43,540
Everyone that's going out there to
conduct the mission is people that are

1157
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:46,630
compliant with what he's saying.
So you would be,

1158
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:51,880
you would be morally a better
person if you said, okay,

1159
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:55,480
I'm going to go ahead and do this.
Because if I don't,

1160
01:07:55,481 --> 01:08:00,220
I know it's going to be someone that's
totally compliant with Shillington and

1161
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,980
I'd rather be there to at
least spare some of the people,

1162
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,800
which we know people did.
And so there's,

1163
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:10,270
there's a little complexity. No, I talk
about this in the business world too.

1164
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:14,080
People say, my boss told me to do this
and, and I, I think it's a bad idea.

1165
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:18,140
I don't think we should do it. Okay, so
are you going to get put off the project?

1166
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,850
Are you going to get
pulled to a different,

1167
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,140
a different department where you
no longer can take care cause you,

1168
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,900
you listen too hard on my people, I'm not,
I refuse to do this. Okay, that's fine.

1169
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:27,950
You refuse to do this.

1170
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:31,370
I'll put someone in there that won't
refuse and you no longer can protect your

1171
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:33,320
people and your people
in a worse situation.

1172
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:38,540
So there's organization is degraded whole
organization. So you raise your hand,

1173
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:43,550
you make your protest. But
sometimes you've got to say, okay,

1174
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:48,530
I've made my protest and I understand
that you're still wanting me to do this

1175
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,720
and even though I think
it's the wrong thing to do,

1176
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,760
I'm going to proceed down the path because
I'd rather me be able to mitigate as

1177
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:59,420
much of this problem as I can. Then have
somebody that's just going to do, do,

1178
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,510
do this to the fullest extent
that you would want them to do.

1179
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,730
So there's another additional
complexity there that it gets involved.

1180
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,710
Absolutely.
Cause sometime as you said,

1181
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:12,940
just the nine you're just
making yourself feel better.

1182
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:15,260
But the reality is that
plan is going to go ahead.

1183
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,320
You are the only thing that's
standing in the way of that plan.

1184
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,960
Going to the 100 percentile,

1185
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:24,370
you can bring it down to 50 you know
he's still going to feel out I go,

1186
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:26,990
you're still going to feel part of
something you don't want to be part of.

1187
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:31,690
But the only thing you do by refusing is
patting yourself on the back and say am

1188
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:35,210
I in all tomorrow guy? It's like,
yeah, but no, cause you know,

1189
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:39,470
it's like the thing is you can use
that power in that situation too for

1190
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:42,000
something that he's better
than if you just, uh,

1191
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:45,500
look at herself in the mirror saying
how great you are by not doing it.

1192
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,220
And in fact that's what it was pitching
Canadian bill about the Sun Click story.

1193
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,230
Silas soul, you know, they,

1194
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,220
he's told right before you
don't want to stay home.

1195
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,550
Nobody's forcing you to just stay home.
Don't be part of it.

1196
01:09:58,551 --> 01:10:02,240
And soul and Kramer and some of those
guys say, no, we want to be there.

1197
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:06,260
We want to be there to observe. We may
be able to make the choice on this spot.

1198
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:09,620
And uh, and he makes a huge
difference right there.

1199
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:13,860
My feeling on it, just sort of looking
at it all from the outside is that,

1200
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:15,830
and especially in a counterinsurgency war,

1201
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:21,040
that without strict military discipline
and strong leadership that abject

1202
01:10:22,371 --> 01:10:24,920
savagery is gravity will take you there.

1203
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,980
That's where things
will head on their own.

1204
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:32,840
Unless you are supremely
focused on discipline and
leadership and education and

1205
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:34,460
those kinds of things
that you don't have to,

1206
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:38,180
you don't really have to ask the question,
how can this kind of thing happen?

1207
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,680
The real question is how does this
not happen all the time, right?

1208
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:46,820
How is it that American
soldiers in Iraq and uh,

1209
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:51,380
you know, you go into Iraq
and they're seeing, uh,

1210
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,001
maybe,

1211
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:57,110
maybe husbands and fathers that they
spoke to the previous day that they know

1212
01:10:57,111 --> 01:10:58,090
are innocent,

1213
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:02,960
not part of the fighting and they see
his wife beheaded and him with a power

1214
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:04,520
drill hole on the side of his head.

1215
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:09,560
How our American soldiers not going and
executing reprisal attacks against these

1216
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:10,580
people all the time.

1217
01:11:10,581 --> 01:11:15,581
How has it not just completely getting
out of hand like that to me is by far the

1218
01:11:15,961 --> 01:11:19,650
more interesting question. I don't have
to ask myself how is it that you know,

1219
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:22,780
somebody went in and shut
up, you know, the, that,

1220
01:11:22,781 --> 01:11:25,800
that the house of the person
who did something like that.

1221
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:28,560
That's an easy question
to answer. And, and the,

1222
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,380
the much more interesting one is how it
doesn't happen all the time and it, it,

1223
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:36,060
it seems like it's, it has
to be institutional. It
can't come down to like, uh,

1224
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,460
you know, institutional culture, right.

1225
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:43,050
I'm relating it to their sense of personal
identity and social identity with the

1226
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:47,340
group that this is not who we
are. Um, that if I do this,

1227
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:49,770
it's not going to win me any,
uh,

1228
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,860
any Kudos from my teammates
or anything like that.

1229
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:56,640
There you're going to look at that as a
betrayal because I'm bringing dishonor

1230
01:11:56,641 --> 01:11:58,740
upon us because this is
not what we're about.

1231
01:11:58,741 --> 01:12:01,590
And they have to be able to look at it
that way. And if they don't know that,

1232
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:05,400
if they don't know that by
doing something like that,

1233
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:08,790
they're going to, uh, you know, they
want to blend in with the group.

1234
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,110
They want to be accepted by the group.

1235
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:12,330
They want to be looked at as
somebody that can be relied on.

1236
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:16,650
And that has to mean following the
rules and doing the right thing.

1237
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:21,460
Yeah. Well, did Danielle, you poured it,
pointed this out earlier. You, you said,

1238
01:12:21,461 --> 01:12:26,140
well this seems like it's just the
communications aspect is so important and

1239
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:30,550
that's 100% right. So
as we all know, the, the

1240
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:37,140
strategy in the Vietnam War for
America was to kill more of them.

1241
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,170
Then they data,

1242
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:43,630
Vos and drop more bombs on
them and eventually they'll
just break just a war of

1243
01:12:43,631 --> 01:12:45,610
attrition. And, and so the,

1244
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,570
the strategy was get rack up as many kill,

1245
01:12:49,571 --> 01:12:53,830
count as high kill count as you
possibly can. So that's the messaging.

1246
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,010
That's the messaging.
So when that's the messaging,

1247
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,090
that's the messaging in,
in Iraq,

1248
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,780
they were very clear about,
hey, we're here too. We're,

1249
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,360
we're not an occupying force.

1250
01:13:07,361 --> 01:13:10,960
We're here to liberate these people were
here to secure the populous and make

1251
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:14,200
sure that they can have a free country.
That's the messaging.

1252
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:16,630
So does that messaging always
make it down to the front lines?

1253
01:13:16,631 --> 01:13:19,770
Know that's why we do have
incidents where Thi, you know, bad,

1254
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,790
horrible things happen.
Absolutely.

1255
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:27,240
But it is about the messaging and it is
about everyone understanding why they're

1256
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:29,500
doing what they're doing,
what their mission is,

1257
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:33,220
what is what is right and what is wrong.

1258
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:36,730
And you can be educated on that legally,
hey,

1259
01:13:36,731 --> 01:13:40,690
you're not allowed to do this. You
can do that, but you can't do this.

1260
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,710
And then the other point that
you made, which is, well,

1261
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:47,500
you said you got to be able to manage
people in a time of crisis as a leader,

1262
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,840
but more important. And you, you actually,

1263
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:54,310
you actually asked a really complicated
question and then answered it yourself.

1264
01:13:54,311 --> 01:13:55,420
And you did that like three times.

1265
01:13:55,421 --> 01:14:00,110
And that one is fear of conversation
that you had with yourself. Yeah, yeah.

1266
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:01,750
Is, is you said, you know,

1267
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:06,010
you gotta be able to manage people in
these pressure situations and then you

1268
01:14:06,011 --> 01:14:08,950
added that. But what you really
need is culture. And you're right,

1269
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:13,780
because you're not going to be there.
The leader is not, I wasn't with my,

1270
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,660
all my elements on the
battlefield all the time.

1271
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:19,570
They were out there all the time
without me all the time without me.

1272
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,190
They were the ones that had to understand
what they could, what they couldn't do.

1273
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,710
They were the ones that had
to make those hard decisions.

1274
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:30,850
They weren't calling my snipers, didn't
call back to me and say, Hey Jocko,

1275
01:14:30,851 --> 01:14:31,810
I see this with this guy.

1276
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:34,810
They didn't even ask their platoon
commanders that they didn't ask anyone.

1277
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,910
They knew what the rules of engagement,
where they knew what our strategy was.

1278
01:14:39,911 --> 01:14:43,720
They understood. And one of the
things that I told them, you know,

1279
01:14:43,721 --> 01:14:46,150
speaking of rules of engagement, so
our rules of engagement was, you know,

1280
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:51,151
several page legalees document written
by some lawyers in Washington DC or

1281
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:54,010
wherever.
And you know,

1282
01:14:54,011 --> 01:14:59,011
I've got kids in my platoon
that are 20 2122 years old,

1283
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:00,663
you know,

1284
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,810
high school graduate and they came in
the seal teams like I did by the way.

1285
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,500
And so they're looking at a legal
document like that. Does it,

1286
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,080
it doesn't mean anything to them.
You know,

1287
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:13,660
my rules of engagement for them or is
it very simple? Make sure that people,

1288
01:15:13,661 --> 01:15:18,640
you're killing our bad. You make sure that
people, you're killing her bad and why.

1289
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:20,950
And then I explained to
them why that was important.

1290
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:26,100
And the reason why that was important
was because the day that some civilians

1291
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,880
brought a headless body that it had
taken a 300 win mag round to the head and

1292
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:37,390
their head was gone and they said,
this was our mom,

1293
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,450
or this was our school teacher,
or this was our neighborhood doctor,

1294
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:44,740
and one of your snipers killed them and
they would figure it out. It was us.

1295
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:49,840
First of all, our operations
would get shut down. So selfishly,

1296
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,820
we don't want to get
our operations shutdown,

1297
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:55,120
but more important than the
selfish reason. If that happened,

1298
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,410
we would leave all the
soldiers and marines that we
were working with on a daily

1299
01:15:59,411 --> 01:16:01,120
basis that we are providing Overwatch for.

1300
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:05,710
We've leave them without the support that
we had committed to give them because

1301
01:16:05,711 --> 01:16:09,430
we weren't allowed to operate anymore
because we weren't being discriminatory

1302
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:13,030
enough with our fire.
So the culture is so important.

1303
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:16,150
People understanding why they're doing
what they're doing is so important.

1304
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:20,020
And if you don't get that messaging
into your point, DNA, Daniella,

1305
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:23,710
if you don't get the
communication correct,

1306
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:26,260
then you're going to end
up in a world of hurt.

1307
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:31,120
And to point you just made the,
make sure the people you key or bad,

1308
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:35,290
he's such a, I think about a
day or so few words, right?

1309
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:38,230
You say teen lake, very, very few words.

1310
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,840
And yet he's so centered
because you look at,

1311
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:45,340
not all the San [inaudible] core me lie,
but look at even like half of the,

1312
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,380
you know, when the Nazi
seeing vade the Soviet Union.

1313
01:16:49,381 --> 01:16:53,110
And then when the Red Army does the
counter and they start invading Germany,

1314
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,220
both armies do horrible seeings
to one another civilian.

1315
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:01,960
And the idea is, well, the Nazis did
to our people. So we did it today.

1316
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:06,220
Our swell that ma'am,
that you are shooting in the head at it.

1317
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:09,010
She had nothing to do with what
happened to your people. She's,

1318
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,780
she's not the Nazi soldier would deed it.

1319
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:14,990
She's not the bad one just because
she's from the same nation.

1320
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,720
Are you kidding me? That's not,
that doesn't make her a bad person.

1321
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,460
And I think that's part of the problem.

1322
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:23,810
We group identity that soft and that's
why I stayed with types are dangerous

1323
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:28,430
because you start grouping individuals
into this mental category you may have of

1324
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:30,590
like those guys are bad.

1325
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:36,130
That individual only share some physical
characteristic with the other one they

1326
01:17:36,711 --> 01:17:40,040
share maybe the or even are related,
but they are not the same person.

1327
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,260
You know the date I haven't
made the same choices.

1328
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:43,820
They haven't committed the same action.

1329
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:47,450
So the fact that you three told the
Cheyenne the same or you decided to retool

1330
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:50,540
the Vietnamese the same or the
Germans the same or the Russians,

1331
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,340
that's where every single is wrong because
you're are not making sure that the

1332
01:17:55,341 --> 01:17:59,030
person you're hurting is
the bad one is not the one.

1333
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,670
There's no a Vange dared.
They are not the same people.

1334
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,360
And so and yet it happens
over and over again.

1335
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:08,330
Where people fall into this
idea of group mentality is,

1336
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,410
well I couldn't catch that guy back.

1337
01:18:11,411 --> 01:18:15,050
He's one of their group is I know man.

1338
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,720
There are individuals that
are involved that are not,

1339
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:21,790
there is no collective guilt off. It's
kind of the same reason why, for example,

1340
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,550
federal reasons strike as I saw all fall
in every possible way because you're

1341
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:28,130
now going against the guide.
I have a grievance against.

1342
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:30,470
You're going against the
guy from the same nation.

1343
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:35,000
It's like that has nothing to do
with one another. You know, they're,

1344
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:39,980
I feel like sometimes group identity,
it's one of those double edged swords,

1345
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:44,240
right? Because on one hand there's a
side of it that we mentioned earlier.

1346
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:49,241
Maybe your loyalty to your group and not
wanting to bring dishonor upon them if

1347
01:18:49,401 --> 01:18:53,660
that's the culture is what keeps you
from putting a bullet in the head of the

1348
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:58,400
guy you just cuffed prep. Um,
you might be able to appeal to a,

1349
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,930
um, you know, you can say to people, hey,

1350
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:06,980
we're Americans and this is not how we
behave and you're appealing to their

1351
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:10,160
group identity there,
you know, and uh, that

1352
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,970
nobody's saying it's a double edge sword.

1353
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:19,260
That is a case in which you
are using group identities
for as the good guys. And,

1354
01:19:19,261 --> 01:19:20,180
and granted,
yeah,

1355
01:19:20,181 --> 01:19:23,870
it may not be that every single one
from.com three really feed that idea by

1356
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:27,350
you're putting a nice ideal and they
are encouraging people to live up to it.

1357
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,420
That's all that IDD furnace from.

1358
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:34,310
While it's similar in dynamics too damned
bad guys and flagging everyone into

1359
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:34,971
dad group,

1360
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:39,971
where do you know that that person really
fit that stereotype at [inaudible] at

1361
01:19:40,771 --> 01:19:43,970
all? How did you make clear to your
men, uh, when you said, you know,

1362
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:47,780
make sure that people you're killing or
bad that they understood what was meant

1363
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:48,614
by that.

1364
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:53,070
It is,
well there's first of all there,

1365
01:19:53,071 --> 01:19:57,260
there are specifics and the rules of
engagement and one of them is called clear

1366
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:00,110
hostile intent, hostile
actor, hostile intent,

1367
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:05,140
which means this person has to be doing
something actively that's going to cause

1368
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:07,440
it cause a negative impact.
Now

1369
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:11,520
you can tell which people are bad.

1370
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,640
You can tell when they're starting to do
something that's hostile actor hostile

1371
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:19,250
intent. You can tell and these
guys, you know, my guys would, they,

1372
01:20:19,251 --> 01:20:21,360
they knew,
they would err on the side of like,

1373
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:25,250
I'm going to make sure that this person
is doing something bad. But you know,

1374
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,890
we had some decent uh,
arguments about the rules of engagement.

1375
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,550
I had some decent arguments about the
rules of engagement off the chain of

1376
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:37,551
command because the rules of engagement
were applying to all of Iraq and Ramadi

1377
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:41,760
was not like the rest of Iraq at
this time in 2006. And you know,

1378
01:20:41,761 --> 01:20:45,960
if you've got someone
that is for instance,

1379
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:51,210
observing a location with binoculars,
right? If you're observing,

1380
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:56,211
if you're in Baghdad and you're look
looking at a location with binoculars,

1381
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:02,010
you're gathering intelligence, which
is, which, which could be considered,

1382
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:05,940
which is not considered a
hostile act. It's, it's, it's
the intelligence gathering.

1383
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,040
You might suspect the person being bad,
but there's,

1384
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,950
there's no way to prove that in Ramadi.

1385
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:15,951
If you saw somebody that was looking
with binoculars at friendly forces,

1386
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,820
they weren't gathering intelligence,

1387
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:21,030
they were absolutely
coordinating attack and attack.

1388
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:25,230
And that is a group that
is a big difference because
that is a hostile act and

1389
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:27,630
it's damn sure hostile
intent. And so, you know,

1390
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:31,290
those are the kinds of things that I
would discuss up the chain of command and

1391
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,220
we would provide them the
resources. You know, it's,

1392
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:39,210
I talk a lot about um,
playing the game, right?

1393
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,180
Like if my boss tells me to do something,
I'm going to play the game.

1394
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:43,580
I'm going to try and do it. And, and,

1395
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:45,510
and occasionally I'll get
the question of like, well,

1396
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,750
what if you get told to do something
that you really don't want to do?

1397
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:51,660
What if you've got told to do something
that you didn't, that you were posed to,

1398
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,230
right?

1399
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:55,470
What if you got the order to go to the
me Lai massacre and you got the order?

1400
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,930
Well, yeah, it's, I know I'd
say no. And first of all,

1401
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,900
that doesn't happen the closest.

1402
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,300
The closest example I have to that
happening was for me in Ramadi,

1403
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:15,170
we had been told that we had to take a
certain number of Iraqi soldiers with us

1404
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,560
on every operation we conducted because
we were trying to turn the war over to

1405
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:19,980
them.

1406
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:24,980
And so they needed to get out there and
do operations and they were telling us

1407
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:29,730
they were putting this, this rule all
over every American unit and Iraq.

1408
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,340
You needed to have an Iraqi
face on every operation.

1409
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:35,580
So what did the Americans do? What
did, what did the American units do?

1410
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:36,930
What they did was they say, okay, yeah,

1411
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:40,260
we're going to take our platoon of 40
guys and we're going to take to Iraqis

1412
01:22:40,261 --> 01:22:43,890
with us, and there's your Iraqi face.
Well, that doesn't move the work forward.

1413
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:47,490
They were obeying the rules.
So the,

1414
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:52,170
the senior leadership figured this out
and said, no, you guys are playing games.

1415
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:55,860
Here's the new rule for every,
and I forget what the number was.

1416
01:22:55,861 --> 01:23:00,210
They made a ratio for every seven
Americans that you have or for every one

1417
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:02,850
American you have to have, you have,
you have to have seven Iraqi's are,

1418
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:06,220
there were some number,
some ratio. And in Ramadi,

1419
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:10,660
some of the units of Iraqis that we
were working with only had 18 guys or 17

1420
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,440
guys.

1421
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,730
And so that would have been me sending
my guys in the field with two or three

1422
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:19,470
seals only, which sending, if you've got,

1423
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:22,270
if you're going to go into a
bad area and you're going to,

1424
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,370
who are you going to send?
Because you want to have a radio man,

1425
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:27,520
you want to have a medic, you want to
have a guy that can call for fires.

1426
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:29,800
You want to have a leader and
you want to have a couple heavy,

1427
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:34,020
heavy weapons guys, that's, that's six or
seven guys right there. Minimum, right?

1428
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:38,080
And so when the chain of command told
me, hey, you got to do this ratio,

1429
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:41,350
I looked at the ratio and then, and I
said, hey guys, uh, in Ramadi, that's,

1430
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:42,670
that's not a good idea and here's why.

1431
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:46,300
I'm not going to send my guys in the field
without a corpsman or without a radio

1432
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:49,000
man, without a Jay Tac or without
a machine gunner. I'm not,

1433
01:23:49,001 --> 01:23:53,950
I'm not going to do that.
And you know what they said?
They said, that makes sense.

1434
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:58,600
Chocolate, you proceed. Like if
you articulate yourself correctly,

1435
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:03,040
then you can get your point across.
Now head they said to me,

1436
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,100
hey listen, no, you're
only allowed to do this.

1437
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:09,340
Well then I would have objected further
up the chain of command and I would not

1438
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:12,640
have put my guys at risk to do
something that didn't make sense.

1439
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:15,910
I'm not not going to do
it. Um, and, and again,

1440
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:20,650
that's what I always encourage military
people, but not as military people,

1441
01:24:20,651 --> 01:24:21,340
business people.

1442
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:26,340
If you're the CEO of a company and you've
given some directive that you don't

1443
01:24:27,761 --> 01:24:32,440
understand the full depth of the directive
that you've given and your frontline

1444
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:32,891
somebody,

1445
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:36,040
somebody in your front lines realizes
that's going to have a hugely negative

1446
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:38,710
impact on your company.
Do you want them just to follow orders?

1447
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:40,500
You absolutely don't
want them to followers.

1448
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:43,210
You want them to raise their hand and
say, hey boss, this doesn't make sense

1449
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,530
and thing. Yeah. You said about, yeah,

1450
01:24:45,531 --> 01:24:49,340
you don't want to surround yourself
with yes men, which makes perfect sense.

1451
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:50,570
Then again,
eats.

1452
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:55,190
It's one of the sinks where you really
need to have work on yourself because the

1453
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:59,690
reality is that most people have an eagle.
Most people don't like to be told,

1454
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:03,830
hey boss, sorry about that. Doesn't
sound right. He's like, what do you mean?

1455
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,860
You know? There's that reaction
is like standing their pride,

1456
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,520
which of course that were old badness
decision shall making started going,

1457
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,520
but he's a very normality. Actually,
you know what I beat? He's like,

1458
01:25:13,521 --> 01:25:17,120
most people have to one degree or
another and ego and his speech. Shelly,

1459
01:25:17,121 --> 01:25:20,510
if like your guy maybe phrase
it, maybe they are right, right.

1460
01:25:20,511 --> 01:25:21,470
The makeup falling toward,

1461
01:25:21,471 --> 01:25:24,170
they are pointing to something
in your plan and doesn't work,

1462
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:27,470
but they phrase it in a way
that's kind of blonde, so a,

1463
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:31,400
you don't like being watched.
The, you don't like the tone.

1464
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,780
By that point, even though their
content is perfectly correct,

1465
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,170
you're not eating it because he's like,
you have a better, I don't like you first.

1466
01:25:39,171 --> 01:25:41,690
They are crazy size we and then you
are going about it with that tone.

1467
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:46,120
The guy is just saying seeings
plainly how they are. Maybe it's not,

1468
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:49,100
it hasn't had a bad tone is
just not cardinally knew.

1469
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:53,390
Wayne likes lowly Jane saying,
Hey, let's see this way

1470
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:55,480
and, and you know what a guy
in that, cause I get the,

1471
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:58,030
I get that kind of question all the time
with all the companies we work with,

1472
01:25:58,031 --> 01:25:59,250
all got this guy and my,

1473
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,080
my boss has a big ego and I can't
correct him because he just,

1474
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:05,090
he just gets a fee. Well first of
all, when you just like you said,

1475
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:08,030
if you've got a big ego and I
tell you that your plan is wrong,

1476
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:11,840
I'm attacking a fortified position
and you're only going to bolster your

1477
01:26:11,841 --> 01:26:16,841
position stronger and so don't attack
that position instead of simple technique

1478
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:19,010
that you can use is say,
hey boss,

1479
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:22,760
I'm really not sure why we're using this
approach. Could you explain this to me?

1480
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:25,280
Because I want to make sure that I really
understand what it is you want me to

1481
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:27,140
do.
And it seems like if I do this right here,

1482
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:29,090
it's going to cause this reaction and,
and I don't want,

1483
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,560
I know you don't want that to happen,

1484
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:34,480
so could you just give me a hand and
fully understanding what your plan is and

1485
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,930
that way you're, you're, you're,

1486
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:39,530
you're kind of massaging their ego a
little bit and it opens their mind and

1487
01:26:39,531 --> 01:26:41,000
that's all you have to
do is open up their ears.

1488
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,420
That's the goal is just to open their
ears a little bit so that you can start to

1489
01:26:44,421 --> 01:26:48,200
have a conversation with them and so that
they can going back to the whole topic

1490
01:26:48,201 --> 01:26:50,810
of today so that they can see
you as a human being with a,

1491
01:26:50,811 --> 01:26:55,280
with an idea or an opinion that actually
matters as opposed to seeing you as

1492
01:26:55,281 --> 01:26:58,730
someone that's attacking their
ego and that ego thing. I mean,

1493
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,650
if you think about the wars
that have been, you know,

1494
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:02,780
we always talk about the wars
that are caused by religion,

1495
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:06,020
but the wars that are caused by
ego or are also pretty severe.

1496
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:10,400
And a lot of these incidents that we
talk about, these retaliatory incidences,

1497
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:12,620
well,
who's going to be the first person to say,

1498
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:17,060
you attacked my tribe and
I'm going to let it slide.

1499
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:22,010
But that's, that's, that's a tough
person. That's a hard position to be in.

1500
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,550
You're seen as weak. You're
seen as you know, vulnerable.

1501
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:28,340
You're seen as someone that can
be pushed around. So there's,

1502
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:33,341
that's a very delicate game that you have
to play and that causes problems with

1503
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:37,610
that. That ends up, that's a
game that's so hard to play.
In fact, that most people,

1504
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:42,140
or many people across the
span of time have said, no,

1505
01:27:42,141 --> 01:27:44,720
I'm not going to say that they did.
They drew blood.

1506
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,760
We're going to draw more blood.

1507
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,693
Yup.
And it

1508
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:53,490
goes to what you were saying a second
ago to your people have to know that

1509
01:27:53,491 --> 01:27:56,190
you're going to ask those questions of
your leadership and that you're doing

1510
01:27:56,490 --> 01:27:58,350
that work because they got to trust you.

1511
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:01,410
You know that way when Jocko
comes to him and says, hey guys,

1512
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,260
I know this is gonna
sound a little bit weird,

1513
01:28:04,261 --> 01:28:07,260
but here's what we're doing and here's
who you're bringing with you and this is

1514
01:28:07,261 --> 01:28:11,070
what we're doing. They know that
if you're telling them to do it,

1515
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:12,960
it's gotta be done.

1516
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:17,760
That every discussion has been had
that every angle has been looked at,

1517
01:28:17,761 --> 01:28:21,390
that you've run it up the chain of
command and registered your objections if

1518
01:28:21,391 --> 01:28:22,170
they're there,

1519
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:26,130
but they know that Jocko is not going
to send us out to do something like this

1520
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,290
unless it simply has to be done.

1521
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,860
And I get asked this question a lot,
well,

1522
01:28:32,861 --> 01:28:37,861
what do I do if one of my subordinates
has a question about the way I've planned

1523
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:42,850
something and I don't have a good
answer? What do I do? Then I say, well,

1524
01:28:42,851 --> 01:28:45,040
what you do then is you listen to them.

1525
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:48,100
You actually listened to what
they're saying because if, if,

1526
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:53,250
if I've told you to do something and
you've then responded with some reason why

1527
01:28:53,951 --> 01:28:57,790
we shouldn't do that thing and I
can't explain away your reason,

1528
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:00,880
then probably I'm wrong.
And, and as a leader,

1529
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:05,100
this is another thing where our ego plays
a role as a leader. Our Ego says, well,

1530
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:07,260
if I admit that I'm wrong to the troops,

1531
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:09,060
they're gonna think I'm up there going
to think I don't know what I'm doing.

1532
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,770
The opposite is actually true.

1533
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:14,340
If I was in charge of youtube
and I presented you with
a plan and you guys came

1534
01:29:14,341 --> 01:29:17,130
back and today that plan's
not smart and I said,

1535
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:20,820
shut up and do it the way I told you,
you don't respect me more,

1536
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:24,080
you respect me less.
And if,

1537
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,670
if I came to you two with a plan and said,
hey guys,

1538
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,350
here's the way we're going to
execute this. And you say, Hey,

1539
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:31,680
that's not a good idea. We should do
it a different way. And I say, okay,

1540
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:34,680
well what do you recommend? And we come
together with a collaborative plan.

1541
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:36,690
You don't think less of me as leader.
As a matter of fact,

1542
01:29:36,691 --> 01:29:37,860
you think more of me as a leader.

1543
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:41,310
You think that I'm a humble guy that will
listen and take input. And by the way,

1544
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,560
bonuses,
you all now have real,

1545
01:29:43,561 --> 01:29:46,440
true ownership of the plan
and we all feel good about it.

1546
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,850
And when you guys go in the field,

1547
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:51,960
you execute it to the utmost
of your ability because
it's something that you own.

1548
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,320
It's amazing how everything
you're saying is,

1549
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:00,380
it's as if you took a list of all the
traits of Lieutenant Calley at me lie and

1550
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:03,030
literally just said,
do the opposite of all these things.

1551
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:07,350
He was a guy who couldn't take criticism
from his men, 100% who asserted a,

1552
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:11,130
you know, who pulled rank anytime,
anything like that happened. Uh,

1553
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:16,220
who was a complete transparent yes man
to his captain above him who was just

1554
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:20,550
never ask any questions. I mean, just
right down the line. And as a result,

1555
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:24,480
his men had no trust in him so that
when they got into a situation that was

1556
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:24,960
chaotic,

1557
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,130
they felt like they were standing out
on the corner by themselves in a country

1558
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:31,290
they didn't understand with
nobody looking out for them.

1559
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:35,220
I don't want to say this in a way that
makes it sound like I'm trying to justify

1560
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,330
anything they did,
of course not.

1561
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:41,660
But you put men in a situation where
they feel like they're in complete chaos

1562
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:46,620
and they happen to have automatic
weapons in their hands. Well,

1563
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:50,220
if I find myself in a situation where
I'm completely overwhelmed by chaos,

1564
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:53,280
that automatic weapons probably going to
start to look like the best tool I have

1565
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,420
for structuring my environment.

1566
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,710
Yeah, there's a, and, and obviously this
went way beyond that. Uh, years ago,

1567
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:02,050
I forget how many years ago there
was a shooting in New York City, uh,

1568
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:05,610
I think it was 38 rounds were fired at,
uh,

1569
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:09,630
maybe a homeless person and unarmed
person. I forget the situation,

1570
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:13,650
but there's a lot of people that
just couldn't believe that all these,

1571
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:19,250
all these police officers shot
at this unarmed individual can.

1572
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:22,290
Horrible situation. And again, I always,

1573
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:25,710
I've always will say this like whenever
I talk about bad police shootings,

1574
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:30,120
I been on ride alongs with cops.
I've done hits with cops.

1575
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,570
It's a freaking hard job. And, and,

1576
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:35,640
and I'm not a guy that like I've done
that a couple times here and there,

1577
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:39,240
but go out on that beat every day and
deal with those scumbags of the world

1578
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:43,440
every single day. And you're going to
have, it's going to be, it's the freedom.

1579
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:46,440
It's one of the hardest jobs in the world.
That situation people to,

1580
01:31:46,441 --> 01:31:50,070
how the hell did that
happen? Well, there's,

1581
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:54,660
there's a lot of tension in a
situation that emotions are high,

1582
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,670
people are screaming,
we're not trained well.

1583
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:59,560
Everyone is sitting there with
their slack out the trigger.

1584
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:03,750
And when that first bang happens, it's
a, it's a chain reaction. That's one.

1585
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:06,400
One of the situations that,
you know,

1586
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:10,870
I would see with my guys
that was beautiful in Ramadi
was they wouldn't do that

1587
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,170
if, if one of the snipers took
appointed shot at someone,

1588
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:17,170
they would take the point of shot
and the others would hold fire,

1589
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:22,030
check fire until, you know,
the, the situation either
evolved or, or deescalated.

1590
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,890
But the,

1591
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:29,080
the army was always quite impressed
with the fact that we would take really

1592
01:32:29,081 --> 01:32:32,470
surgical shots at bad guys and
there wouldn't be, you know,

1593
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:38,260
massive amounts of collateral damage.
Again, sometimes it's unavoidable, but

1594
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,250
maybe you can talk a
little bit about that.

1595
01:32:40,251 --> 01:32:44,200
Cause I think that's one thing that gets
really lost on a lot of people saying.

1596
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:47,170
I think there's a lot of propaganda
that helps it get lost. You know,

1597
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:50,970
there's no question that there's
been an evolution and um,

1598
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:54,860
our values and our relationship to
these kinds of things over the years.

1599
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:59,030
So you go back to something
like San Creek, 1864, uh,

1600
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:02,810
there might not have been a whole lot
of people shedding too many tears over

1601
01:33:02,811 --> 01:33:06,350
what happened.
You get up to me lie and you know,

1602
01:33:06,351 --> 01:33:10,040
there's some controversy and there's
some, you know, there's a cover up,

1603
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:11,000
all those kinds of things.

1604
01:33:11,001 --> 01:33:15,410
But once it comes out and it's laid
bare and the evidence is clear,

1605
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:20,120
things had changed from 1864, and that,
that incident and a few, you know,

1606
01:33:20,121 --> 01:33:22,130
other incidents that were going on,
it made it out.

1607
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:24,980
Or a few pictures that came out,
it turned people against the war.

1608
01:33:24,981 --> 01:33:29,700
They decided that this is not worth
putting our men in a situation where we're

1609
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:33,650
going to be doing things like this. This
is not worth it. And you get up to today,

1610
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:36,080
uh, in the Iraq war or
something like Abu Ghraib,

1611
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:38,600
which is an unacceptable situation,

1612
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:43,700
but we're talking about prisoner abuse.
That doesn't,

1613
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:44,430
uh,

1614
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:49,400
th th th that wouldn't cause the people
who were working in that prison five

1615
01:33:49,401 --> 01:33:54,260
years before that the Iraqis who
worked for Saddam, that wouldn't even,

1616
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:58,850
you know, they, they wouldn't even make it
through their filter. Right. So, I mean,

1617
01:33:59,030 --> 01:34:02,450
what, what was going on there
with the American soldiers?
It was, it was not okay,

1618
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:07,190
but it wasn't walking into a village
and mastering 500 people. It wasn't,

1619
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,033
uh,
you know,

1620
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:14,150
brutal torture in the same way that we
would think of what was going on before

1621
01:34:14,151 --> 01:34:18,610
we took control of that prison. And yet
our response to that in the military,

1622
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:22,730
his response to it once it came
out was pretty dramatic. I mean,

1623
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,980
was theirs and it was quick.
It didn't,

1624
01:34:24,981 --> 01:34:27,590
there was not as much of a delay
as soon as it comes out of theirs.

1625
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,130
So there's a clear shift
that's going on there, if,

1626
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:34,250
if even primarily from the standpoint of
it's just, it's a breach and discipline,

1627
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:35,570
that's not how you behave.

1628
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:36,851
Yeah. And, and,

1629
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:41,851
and one of the things that I'd talk
about with my guys is because you got to

1630
01:34:41,921 --> 01:34:44,830
frame this right because you,
you know,

1631
01:34:44,831 --> 01:34:48,820
you mentioned earlier that if you had to
dealt with this person that had cut the

1632
01:34:48,821 --> 01:34:51,540
heads off of the three year
old girl yesterday and now you,

1633
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:56,440
you had him cuffed and knew it was him,
that guy deserves a bullet, right? I, Hey,

1634
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:00,590
I agree with you. That guy
deserves a bullet. The problem is,

1635
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:03,740
well, number one, it's a
breakdown in discipline,

1636
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:08,800
but to me more important and what I would
tell my guys is if we behave that way,

1637
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:16,330
we have a significant chance of
strategically negatively impacting our war

1638
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:21,740
effort. So I get that you
want to kill these bad guys,

1639
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:25,700
but more important than us killing these
bad guys is us in winning this war.

1640
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:28,340
And so if we run around doing dumb things,

1641
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:30,560
we're going to have a negative
strategic impact on the,

1642
01:35:30,561 --> 01:35:35,090
and that was actually always the biggest
worry as a leader is you don't want to

1643
01:35:35,091 --> 01:35:38,470
have some, something happened
where you, you know, you,

1644
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,480
you drop a bomb on the
wrong area or you know,

1645
01:35:41,481 --> 01:35:43,800
in a bunch of civilians get
killed or you know, you,

1646
01:35:43,801 --> 01:35:45,770
you don't want to have that thing happen.
That's a real,

1647
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:51,700
and the effort and lengths that American
forces go to to prevent civilian

1648
01:35:52,341 --> 01:35:56,180
casualties is, is incredible. I don't
think most people have any idea.

1649
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,700
No they don't.
They don't works.

1650
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:00,550
And I think that's why of the
coolest things about creatine,

1651
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:04,510
a certain methodology that people would
want to live up to the first time you

1652
01:36:04,511 --> 01:36:05,740
say it,
he may not be through,

1653
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:09,880
he may be a wishful thinking that you
hired those people and you're not quite

1654
01:36:09,881 --> 01:36:14,190
there. But as people keep repeating
eighth and your, and again and again we'd,

1655
01:36:14,191 --> 01:36:17,980
the fact that your behavior doesn't
match your ideas more and more people we

1656
01:36:17,981 --> 01:36:20,170
keep working on trying to
actually build that thing.

1657
01:36:20,171 --> 01:36:22,140
They don't want to feel
that like hypocrites.

1658
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,340
They actually want to
live up to that idea.

1659
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:29,850
And that's one of the sinks were why is
sometimes people get turned off by when

1660
01:36:29,921 --> 01:36:33,640
you have these high minded id, I'll end
this very poor behavior. Or they're like,

1661
01:36:33,641 --> 01:36:37,270
oh, look at that hypocrisy. They,
Sadie's seeing Sunday domain it, well,

1662
01:36:37,271 --> 01:36:38,920
sometime when you say it long enough,

1663
01:36:38,921 --> 01:36:42,160
people actually do want to live up to
it and they do change their behavior.

1664
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:45,640
So while the theory may not match
the practice, when you start,

1665
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:48,880
if you keep at it long enough,
the practice may try to,

1666
01:36:48,881 --> 01:36:52,870
he inched closer to mention that
theory ideals, not a bad thing.

1667
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:55,350
I mean, I, I, you can take it

1668
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:58,730
to uh, uh, political context, right?

1669
01:36:58,731 --> 01:37:03,731
When people can point back at the United
States say before the 1960s and before

1670
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:07,130
the civil war and point
to the Constitution and
declaration of independence in

1671
01:37:07,131 --> 01:37:11,570
these high minded ideas and people love
to be the cynical one that says, oh yeah,

1672
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:16,220
yeah, yeah, but slavery and of course,
but this and that. And yeah, totally,

1673
01:37:16,221 --> 01:37:18,650
totally true. But the, the,

1674
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:22,070
the conclusion to draw
from that is not that, uh,

1675
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:26,060
the ideals don't matter or
that they're just on paper.

1676
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,990
The fact that those ideals where there
was what allowed the civil rights

1677
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:33,130
movement to eventually ups come
into being, that's what I, you know,

1678
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:37,640
gave us the room. In fact, you could even
say that the thing we're talking about,

1679
01:37:37,641 --> 01:37:41,450
the same thing, uh, that gap
between ideal and reality.

1680
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,980
One Way to talk about that is hypocrisy.
But at the same time, that gap,

1681
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:47,600
that opening is,

1682
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:52,220
that's the opening where people realize
that and say there is a gap between our

1683
01:37:52,221 --> 01:37:56,670
professed ideals and it makes room for
that of positive change. Right? I mean,

1684
01:37:56,671 --> 01:37:58,830
you can go back, uh, there was,

1685
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:03,890
the Mongols were never ever going to give
up slavery because their moral system

1686
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:09,000
didn't have room for that. Yeah. And so
if you could go up to them and say, well,

1687
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:13,050
how dare you enslave these people and
they're not going to get defensive,

1688
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,890
they're going to look at you like you're
crazy because there's no room for that,

1689
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:21,180
you know, for that gap. That idea
doesn't even exist yet. Right, right.

1690
01:38:21,181 --> 01:38:25,230
And so the ideal is matter. And when, uh,
when, when they're broken, um, you know,

1691
01:38:25,231 --> 01:38:25,800
again,

1692
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:30,330
I think that there's a motivation on
the part of a lot of people who are,

1693
01:38:30,331 --> 01:38:31,950
who were more cynical than they should be,

1694
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:37,230
a given the country that they're
fortunate enough to live in, you know. Um,

1695
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:41,220
and this is something that you get
from going overseas to a lot of places.

1696
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:44,160
It's something certainly that I got
from spending so much time and African,

1697
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:46,500
the Middle East for work is,
boy,

1698
01:38:46,501 --> 01:38:50,940
you come back after the first trip to
over to those places and you realize you

1699
01:38:50,941 --> 01:38:54,090
want to kiss the ground when you get off
that airplane and you want to go around

1700
01:38:54,091 --> 01:38:56,130
and just hug everybody.
You see,

1701
01:38:56,250 --> 01:39:00,600
because you were so fortunate to live in
a place where things that we absolutely

1702
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:05,270
take for granted over here are
miracles. And, um, you know,

1703
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:10,200
I think, uh, one of the things I
did really didn't want to do, um,

1704
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:13,360
when I was talking about
me lying that episode, um,

1705
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:18,870
I stayed very focused on the,
uh, the incident itself, sort of.

1706
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,700
Um, because I, you don't want to,

1707
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:27,110
you don't want to be making excuses for
something like that and you don't want

1708
01:39:27,111 --> 01:39:31,980
to make it seem like you're trying
to gloss over and atrocity. Um,

1709
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:33,263
but,

1710
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:41,040
but you don't want to, uh, give
fuel to that idea that like this is,

1711
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:45,270
this speaks to like a larger problem in
our society because I just don't believe

1712
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:46,104
that

1713
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:47,003
[inaudible] right.

1714
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:51,370
If you start pushing the button too much
in the direction of making apologies

1715
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:55,820
for, well, after all, we are good guys
and there are a few exceptions by Luke.

1716
01:39:55,821 --> 01:40:00,140
We are, we stand for freedom and
democracy. He's like, yeah, maybe,

1717
01:40:00,141 --> 01:40:04,280
but let's not be so quick about sweeping
under the rug. All the bad stuff.

1718
01:40:04,281 --> 01:40:07,970
Let's look at it. The guys, we instead
of push on the button off, hey,

1719
01:40:07,971 --> 01:40:09,170
look at all the bad stuff.

1720
01:40:09,171 --> 01:40:12,800
That means that all of these ideas are
crap and it's not real and it's only

1721
01:40:12,801 --> 01:40:15,740
Parker's. He's like, Whoa,
slow down on a second. Yeah,

1722
01:40:15,741 --> 01:40:19,190
you got a couple of points where you
are right by are also missing the boat.

1723
01:40:19,191 --> 01:40:22,220
It's like, it's almost like, and
that happens in most discussion,

1724
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:26,570
like in most situations,
you rarely have somebody with 100% wrong,

1725
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:31,010
is that they take a powershell truths
and they take it too far and they lose

1726
01:40:31,011 --> 01:40:33,170
perspective of the other
side of the equation.

1727
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,810
People don't understand
like American soldiers

1728
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,230
were killed and maimed,
uh,

1729
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:43,310
in situations that absolutely could
have been avoided if we disregarded our

1730
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,830
rules of engagement. And if we made, like,

1731
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:49,980
we made conscious decisions to put
ourselves at risk when we did not have to

1732
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:52,890
because we were trying to be sensitive
to the environment and to the people that

1733
01:40:52,891 --> 01:40:54,460
were.
And

1734
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:58,840
I don't think enough people recognize
the historical anomaly that that is.

1735
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:00,730
I mean, that is just a, you can't,

1736
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:06,120
for thousands of years of human history
that is just completely unthinkable.

1737
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:09,580
You couldn't imagine something like that.
And the extent to which we go,

1738
01:41:09,581 --> 01:41:11,650
I mean Jocko has talked about
this before in his show,

1739
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:15,400
the extent to which we go to try to
make sure that the people, you know,

1740
01:41:15,401 --> 01:41:19,450
the targets that we're, that we're
dealing with our targets. Um,

1741
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,840
I think if more civilians
had, uh, had, uh,

1742
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,680
an idea of that people would
feel a lot different about,

1743
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:28,390
about what we do over there.
You know,

1744
01:41:28,391 --> 01:41:31,180
it doesn't mean that when
something happens like ob of grave,

1745
01:41:31,181 --> 01:41:33,610
they're not going to,
uh, react against that,

1746
01:41:33,611 --> 01:41:37,390
but they're going to react against
it from a place of, hey, we're,

1747
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:41,390
we're a good country. That shit is not
going to fly. All right? That's not what,

1748
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:44,950
you're not going to represent us that way.
And that's fine.

1749
01:41:44,951 --> 01:41:49,510
That's a healthy way to respond to
something like that. Um, but you know,

1750
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:52,630
again, political situation
or whatever else is going on,

1751
01:41:52,631 --> 01:41:55,570
like people have more of a knee jerk
reaction to those things that you're

1752
01:41:55,571 --> 01:41:58,750
talking about us. You can get that
sense. It goes back to that, uh,

1753
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:00,610
Dan Carlin approach to things,
right?

1754
01:42:00,611 --> 01:42:04,690
That ability to look at sinks one way
and just when you're getting comfortable

1755
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:08,950
with Dako conclusions to say, yes,
maybe that is the conclusion we take,

1756
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:10,000
but it's not that easy.

1757
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:13,900
There's also at 20% from the other
side that's not really wrong.

1758
01:42:13,901 --> 01:42:17,710
Then you food including that and
that keeps you thinking on your toes.

1759
01:42:17,711 --> 01:42:19,000
You don't become dogmatic,

1760
01:42:19,001 --> 01:42:21,580
you don't become thinking
purely black and white terms.

1761
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:26,440
You always have to have that nuance
approach, which, and that's the problem.

1762
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,430
That's the other pirate jokes.

1763
01:42:27,431 --> 01:42:29,770
He's most people that they
can advance to mean weakness.

1764
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,950
Then you can't make up your mind.
You are too wishy washy.

1765
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:35,230
You are is not black.
It's an off.

1766
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:38,020
Why two somewhere in there is like mill.

1767
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:43,050
That's also a weakness is the ability to
look at things both ways and also make

1768
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:47,440
a decision that's where can we
can seen as where it's available.

1769
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:50,620
And I think he's funny because so many
of the things that joker burning up are

1770
01:42:50,621 --> 01:42:55,621
so about really the kind of human
being that you want to become.

1771
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,560
You know about self perfection really.
Cause that's what it boils down to,

1772
01:42:59,561 --> 01:43:00,131
which is Dan,

1773
01:43:00,131 --> 01:43:03,250
what makes you a great leader because
there no good athlete or without somebody

1774
01:43:03,251 --> 01:43:07,130
was work on themselves a lot and you
know when you better get down to the

1775
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:11,500
suppose nothing sounds like
it's that hard, right? He's
all like, okay, of course.

1776
01:43:11,501 --> 01:43:16,090
Yeah, that makes sense. So
that completely, and yet
it's one of the Sikhs were,

1777
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:20,330
while the theory may not be that hard,
the practices and the Atlanta team,

1778
01:43:20,331 --> 01:43:24,430
you have to be at it every single day
or it's Swiss. It was leap. There's,

1779
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:28,410
there's a great line in the doubted chain
that I was actually surely their road

1780
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:29,650
or driving down,
there's,

1781
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,590
there's the law is line
at say my way is Vat,

1782
01:43:33,591 --> 01:43:37,490
easy to understand and very easy to
practice, but nobody understands it.

1783
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:41,650
Nobody trap. And I love
it because in tod, yes,

1784
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,520
it's not that bad.
It's fairly straightforward.

1785
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:49,480
And yet there are so many steps along the
way where is easy to go their own path.

1786
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:52,220
That is,
the theory is easy.

1787
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:55,560
The practice cs, you need to put
in the work and there's no subsidy.

1788
01:43:55,561 --> 01:43:58,460
Each of those steps matters so much to,
because you know,

1789
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:02,060
Jocko was talking about escalation
in those situations. The, um,

1790
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:04,760
the book about the war in Chechnya,
you talked about, I think the line,

1791
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,720
I hadn't read the book until I heard
your podcast on it and it just,

1792
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,540
it's one of those things that
when you hear it, it's so obvious.

1793
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,590
But if you were to just step back from
the context a little bit kind of seems

1794
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:20,390
ridiculous is which is that the savagery
started when people stop shaving,

1795
01:44:20,391 --> 01:44:21,710
when soldiers stopped shaving.

1796
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:26,320
And I think part of the reason for
something like that is, uh, once it is,

1797
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:30,290
it's like the escalation is like a
ratchet. Once you stopped shaving,

1798
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:34,820
well now you're a unit that doesn't
shave anymore. Okay, whatever. Well,

1799
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:37,520
what that means is if you're
a unit that lacks discipline,

1800
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:41,840
well now your lack of discipline is
not going to manifest, is not shaving.

1801
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,930
You already don't shave. That's
normal. That's totally normal.

1802
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:48,560
So now your lack of discipline is
going to get to the next thing.

1803
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:51,020
Now I'm not cleaning my weapons properly.

1804
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:54,020
And then pretty soon you're a unit that
doesn't shave and doesn't clean your

1805
01:44:54,021 --> 01:44:56,990
weapons properly. And that doesn't even
seem like a lack of discipline anymore.

1806
01:44:57,020 --> 01:45:00,590
That just seems like daily life and now
your lack of discipline or whatever it

1807
01:45:00,591 --> 01:45:03,680
is, is going to go up to the next
spot. And it can happen with, you know,

1808
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:07,190
it can happen with just brutality and
savagery and things like that as well.

1809
01:45:07,191 --> 01:45:11,690
We're now, this kind of thing is
just normal. So if I'm angry, uh,

1810
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:15,950
and it's totally normal for us to be able
to smack these prisoners in the face,

1811
01:45:15,951 --> 01:45:18,680
but now I'm really pissed. Well, I'm
not going to smack them in the face.

1812
01:45:18,681 --> 01:45:20,750
I smack them in the face anyway,
you know,

1813
01:45:20,751 --> 01:45:25,670
so I'm going to show my anger
now by stepping it up and
man, well, okay, if that's,

1814
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:29,720
if that slides and the leadership
doesn't step in, well now that's normal.

1815
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,850
You know, we're, you know,
we don't just smack soldiers,

1816
01:45:31,851 --> 01:45:35,720
we punched and kicked soldiers that once,
that's the baseline,

1817
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:39,520
it ratchets up to that point. It's going
to escalate from there because you know,

1818
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,760
that's kind of where it goes.

1819
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:44,360
And that's why it catching those things
right at the beginning and letting

1820
01:45:44,361 --> 01:45:48,200
people know that, you know, all
of these things matter. I mean,

1821
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:51,440
that's probably the life lesson.
A lot of the stuff you even talk about it,

1822
01:45:51,441 --> 01:45:53,510
everything matters.
It all matters.

1823
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:57,310
Yeah. And not, it takes some time.

1824
01:45:57,311 --> 01:46:02,311
Like I didn't realize this when I was a
20 year old seal or a 25 year old seal.

1825
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:07,470
You know, I kind of started
getting the indications and,

1826
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:08,990
and that's why again,
you know,

1827
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,180
I talk about training and
leadership because that's
what this stuff is. You know,

1828
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:16,240
putting somebody into a moral dilemma

1829
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:22,510
with no training is like putting someone
onto the Jujitsu Mat with no training.

1830
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:25,180
They're just going to get destroyed.
Whatever's gonna happen,

1831
01:46:25,181 --> 01:46:29,290
it's gonna happen and they have
no control over it. And you know,

1832
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,270
you got to think about these things.

1833
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:36,370
You got to think deeply about these
things so that you have some sort of an

1834
01:46:36,371 --> 01:46:38,500
anchor that's grounded,

1835
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:41,980
that won't get ripped out at the
first person that says, hey shoot,

1836
01:46:41,981 --> 01:46:45,030
that three year old baby you want,

1837
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:49,710
you need to be grounded and have thought
about these things in a deeper way. And,

1838
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:55,310
and you know what you said about
people swaying one way or the other.

1839
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:03,020
You're right and people actually want
to be led and they want to be led even

1840
01:47:05,071 --> 01:47:09,360
more. So when there is a
pressure situation going on,

1841
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:14,580
when there's something that you're not
used to or that people aren't used to,

1842
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:17,910
some kind of structure, some,
some kind of stress or pressure,

1843
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:23,160
if you can step up and lead at that
moment, people are looking for,

1844
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:25,260
they're looking for a
leader and that was it.

1845
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:28,830
I remember you were talking about one
of the guys in me lie the six foot three

1846
01:47:28,831 --> 01:47:31,080
guy and he's a natural leader,
right?

1847
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:33,150
He's a natural leader that
people kind of fall in.

1848
01:47:33,151 --> 01:47:37,530
What he started going sideways and it
started just getting completely savage and

1849
01:47:37,531 --> 01:47:42,240
brutal people just Kinda, okay. You
know, he's the guy, you know, like, okay,

1850
01:47:42,241 --> 01:47:45,070
that guy's stepping up
and, and that's, and,

1851
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:49,410
and there was no one on the other
end of the spectrum to say, Hey, no,

1852
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,060
we're not doing that.
Stop.

1853
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:55,260
And that's the biggest lesson from
that situation actually from both the

1854
01:47:55,261 --> 01:47:58,260
situations. Yeah. And you know, you know,

1855
01:47:58,261 --> 01:48:01,710
people talk about is how can the leader
be responsible if they're not there?

1856
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:04,980
You know? Yes. The leader's responsible,

1857
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:07,500
whether they're the way they train
the people, the way they educated,

1858
01:48:07,501 --> 01:48:10,350
the way they communicated, the culture
that they sat with those people,

1859
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,191
they're responsible.

1860
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:14,400
And certainly these leaders were
absolutely responsible in these scenarios.

1861
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:18,650
I guess before we wrap up, one last thing
I want to ask you is these days, um,

1862
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:21,790
you say you work a lot with
businesses. You clearly are, you know,

1863
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:26,190
you're working primarily on the concept
of leadership and out to teach people a

1864
01:48:26,191 --> 01:48:30,560
better tools to handle it. How
do you go about it? What's your,

1865
01:48:30,561 --> 01:48:35,540
what is it primarily like a
business oriented approach
now with major businesses

1866
01:48:35,541 --> 01:48:36,374
that are,

1867
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:36,891
yeah,

1868
01:48:36,891 --> 01:48:41,510
we'll go in and do an assessment and
figure out where the friction points are.

1869
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:45,440
Figure out where they're
having problems and,

1870
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:48,470
and then we solve the
problems that they're having
through leadership and that's

1871
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:54,220
every single problem in every single
organization is a leadership problem.

1872
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:58,610
All of them,
whether it's your p and is upside down,

1873
01:48:58,611 --> 01:49:00,710
whether it's your processes
are working correctly,

1874
01:49:00,711 --> 01:49:02,570
whether you got the wrong
people in the wrong positions,

1875
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:07,820
it doesn't matter what the problems are
going to get solved through leadership

1876
01:49:07,821 --> 01:49:10,070
and leadership alone.
And that's why we,

1877
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,450
that's why we're doing well because if
you've got a, if you've got a p and l,

1878
01:49:14,451 --> 01:49:15,051
it's upside down.

1879
01:49:15,051 --> 01:49:18,260
You've got leaders that aren't paying
attention to their expenditures and and

1880
01:49:18,261 --> 01:49:21,530
their income, right? If you've
got processes that aren't working,

1881
01:49:21,531 --> 01:49:24,650
you've got leaders that are in charge of
those processes that are allowing them

1882
01:49:24,651 --> 01:49:27,320
to continue to exist without refinement.

1883
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:31,250
If you've got people that are in positions
that shouldn't be in those positions,

1884
01:49:31,251 --> 01:49:34,640
you've got leaders that are allowing
them to be in those positions without

1885
01:49:34,641 --> 01:49:38,390
either being coached and mentored and
trained so that they can lead or removed

1886
01:49:38,391 --> 01:49:42,380
from those positions and you can go
right down the list with any problem that

1887
01:49:42,381 --> 01:49:43,670
any organization has.
Having.

1888
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:48,040
There's a leadership solution to
that problem and that's what we

1889
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,360
do. It seems to me like as definitely
the thing I'm going to take away from the

1890
01:49:52,361 --> 01:49:52,721
most,

1891
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:55,840
and listen you talk about this stuff is
one of the things that struck me as I

1892
01:49:55,841 --> 01:49:57,970
came in with a lot of questions in mind.

1893
01:49:57,971 --> 01:50:01,040
I wanted to talk to you about like
that I started out with, right? You,

1894
01:50:01,041 --> 01:50:01,871
you've got your guys,

1895
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:04,990
you're going into a horrible situation
and there's these horrible things going

1896
01:50:04,991 --> 01:50:05,111
on.

1897
01:50:05,111 --> 01:50:09,790
How did you restrain your guys from going
and retaliating in these terrible ways

1898
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:12,640
and your response and the look on
your face and everything to it?

1899
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:14,650
It actually like kind of
threw me off a little bit.

1900
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:19,450
It wasn't what I was expecting
because your, your answer
to that really was, dude,

1901
01:50:19,451 --> 01:50:23,670
if I have gotten to the point where we're
there in Iraq and there was a guy with

1902
01:50:23,690 --> 01:50:27,250
handcuffs and I have to figure out how
to restrain my guys from doing something

1903
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:32,410
I failed a long time ago. You cause you
took it as almost like Ah, well you know,

1904
01:50:32,411 --> 01:50:35,320
you deal with it. That was taken
care of. How do we stop them?

1905
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:38,590
We stopped him in training. We stopped,
I mean bootcamp, we stopped to make buds.

1906
01:50:38,591 --> 01:50:40,540
We stuffed them in all the way up to here

1907
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:43,640
and I don't want to make, I don't
want to, I don't want to make that,

1908
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:48,110
I don't want to make light of that
cause that, that is a hard situation.

1909
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:53,500
And when you lose guys in a unit of 35
guys and you got guys that are wounded

1910
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:57,980
and killed, there is absolutely, uh,

1911
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:04,660
there is an absolute fire that you have
to control because we know who's doing

1912
01:51:09,471 --> 01:51:13,340
it. We can find them, we can get out
there and get and get after them.

1913
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:17,720
And so we, we do have to keep
ourselves in check. We do, I mean,

1914
01:51:17,721 --> 01:51:22,430
we had many conversations of,
hey, remember why we're here.

1915
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:27,170
Remember who we represent.
Remember that if we get out of line,

1916
01:51:27,410 --> 01:51:30,200
we won't even be allowed to
do what we do anymore. Oh, so,

1917
01:51:30,201 --> 01:51:35,090
so don't take it the wrong way.
That in any unit, any unit,

1918
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:39,320
you lose people, you lose your
friends, you lose your brothers.

1919
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,540
That is an emotional,

1920
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:47,690
it's an emotional thing and you're in
an emotional situation already and you

1921
01:51:47,691 --> 01:51:48,950
have access,

1922
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:54,010
direct access to unleash your
emotions if you're allowed to.

1923
01:51:56,090 --> 01:51:59,420
And Yeah, the, you know,

1924
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:03,200
with the platoon commanders that worked
for me with, I mean those guys, you know,

1925
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:06,580
Lafe who wrote the book with me,
I mean he absolutely had to,

1926
01:52:06,710 --> 01:52:11,480
had to sit as guys down and explained to
them, hey, let's remember why we're here.

1927
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:16,840
Let's remember that we could go
to jail if we do the wrong thing.

1928
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:21,020
And nothing that we do here is worth any
of you going to jail for any amount of

1929
01:52:21,021 --> 01:52:25,280
time. So I didn't mean to make
light of how hard that is.

1930
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:30,500
And, and how difficult that can
be. And, and it's not just for me,

1931
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:33,500
not just for the seals,
but you know,

1932
01:52:33,501 --> 01:52:36,290
the marines just soldiers that were
there who are dealing with, like I said,

1933
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:40,220
they're dealing with younger kids
and, and uh, less with less training.

1934
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:43,250
And you know, those, when
you come in the seal teams,

1935
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,870
you came in because he
wanted to go to combat.

1936
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:49,550
Like every single CEO wants to go
to combat. They want to be there.

1937
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:52,630
I don't know if you've ever heard
my retirement speech. It's, it's,

1938
01:52:52,730 --> 01:52:57,440
it's on youtube. But when like
I made a list and said, hey,

1939
01:52:57,470 --> 01:53:02,060
if you want to go over to the eastern
part of Ramadi and live in, uh, in, uh,

1940
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:06,860
blown out bunker and get into fire fights
every day, put your name on this list.

1941
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:07,850
And I walked out of the room,

1942
01:53:07,851 --> 01:53:10,730
I came back 20 minutes later and every
single guy in the task unit had their

1943
01:53:10,731 --> 01:53:13,850
name on the list. So we're, we're
dealing with guys at every single guy.

1944
01:53:13,851 --> 01:53:17,900
That's what they want to do. Now. Do they
get tired? Do they get combat stress?

1945
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:22,220
They absolutely do. Do they get
scared? Yes they do. It's, it's hard.

1946
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:27,320
But we have a guy that at least start
from the position of I want to do this.

1947
01:53:27,321 --> 01:53:29,750
This is my profession.
The army, you know, you,

1948
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:32,750
you definitely end up with guys that are
coming in the army because they wanted

1949
01:53:32,751 --> 01:53:35,740
to pay for college or they wanted to
get a job or they wanted to get out of

1950
01:53:35,741 --> 01:53:39,170
whatever hometown there in and, and that's
how they ended up in the army. Again,

1951
01:53:39,290 --> 01:53:43,230
there is also a great number of soldiers
that are just as eager for combat and

1952
01:53:43,231 --> 01:53:47,300
certainly a great number of marines
that are the same attitude. So each,

1953
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:49,470
each one of those people,
you have your own challenges and it,

1954
01:53:49,570 --> 01:53:51,890
and it is hard and you do have to,

1955
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:56,510
and what goes back to what this whole
thing has been about as the leader,

1956
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,170
you can't be the one that's getting
wrapped up in those emotions.

1957
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:03,020
You can't be the one when
you, yeah, I'll tell you what,

1958
01:54:03,021 --> 01:54:06,950
your heart's going to be fucking broken.
When you lose guys,

1959
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:11,540
it's going to be broken and you're going
to want nothing more than to go out and

1960
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,930
rubble cds and salt the earth.

1961
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:18,860
So everyone is dead and no one
will ever live there again.

1962
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:24,010
But if you let that get
ahold of you as the leader,

1963
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:25,680
yeah,

1964
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,550
your,
your,

1965
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:30,750
your team and your men
are going to be in hell,

1966
01:54:31,050 --> 01:54:31,980
that's where they're going to end up.

1967
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:37,740
And so that's why the education,
the training, the understanding,

1968
01:54:37,741 --> 01:54:41,550
I mean it's so many people contacted me
after I did the, the, the me lie podcast.

1969
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:45,350
That isn't your thank you that they,
they play that meal.

1970
01:54:45,351 --> 01:54:49,980
I podcast for leadership training
inside multiple military organizations.

1971
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:51,030
It's,
it's awesome.

1972
01:54:51,210 --> 01:54:54,420
I'm so happy that they do that because
when I came out with that podcast,

1973
01:54:54,421 --> 01:54:56,970
I had tons of people that said I didn't,
it didn't know about that.

1974
01:54:57,270 --> 01:55:00,450
People that were in leadership
positions didn't understand,

1975
01:55:00,451 --> 01:55:03,780
didn't know what the meal I'm
asking her was. And it's, uh,

1976
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:07,920
it's one of the darkest
stains on our history.

1977
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:12,060
But you have to talk about it and
you talked earlier about, hey,

1978
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:12,930
I don't want to make it.

1979
01:55:12,930 --> 01:55:15,690
I didn't really want to go into too
much of what led up to it cause I didn't

1980
01:55:15,691 --> 01:55:17,550
want to make excuses,
man.

1981
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:21,480
I went into detail of why it happened
because I want everyone to understand all

1982
01:55:21,481 --> 01:55:24,090
those little things.
How when you cut those corners,

1983
01:55:24,091 --> 01:55:28,590
how when you play the telephone game
with your intelligence and you let people

1984
01:55:28,591 --> 01:55:31,320
say things that you don't put
them in check and you don't,

1985
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:34,800
you let them use words that are correct
and you've people that don't have a

1986
01:55:34,801 --> 01:55:36,510
culture to ask why we're doing this.

1987
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:41,750
And you set those situations up and
you let bad leaders into situate or in

1988
01:55:41,941 --> 01:55:45,930
positions that they shouldn't be Cali
failing out of ocs multiple times.

1989
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:48,000
Like that's it.
That's it.

1990
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:53,030
You let those things happen and you're
going to end up in hell and as a leader,

1991
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,090
that's your job to stop it.
Yeah.

1992
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:59,770
That's a good place to wrap
it up, man. Me Lie. You lie.

1993
01:55:59,771 --> 01:56:02,680
It didn't necessarily
happen on March 16th,

1994
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:06,010
1968 it happened when Kelly failed.
It was ocs.

1995
01:56:06,070 --> 01:56:09,340
It happened when the intelligence
failed to get passed down properly.

1996
01:56:09,341 --> 01:56:13,420
It failed every time somebody was allowed
to smack around a Vietnamese and they

1997
01:56:13,421 --> 01:56:16,780
didn't get called on it. That's when
it happened. You know, the, the, the,

1998
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:21,400
the actual acute incident was just the
result of a long, long process. So.

1999
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:24,520
Awesome. It's great
man. Thank you so much.

2000
01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:25,301
Thanks for having me on.

2001
01:56:25,301 --> 01:56:30,301
Thanks for you guys for what you do and
you guys put out kick ass podcasts and I

2002
01:56:30,431 --> 01:56:34,840
appreciate listening to them and
maybe we'll get to do this again

2003
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,020
in South Dakota as well. I mean, I can
tell you from my own personal experience,

2004
01:56:39,021 --> 01:56:42,920
listen to your podcast as well as
a lot of guys I know of all ages,

2005
01:56:42,921 --> 01:56:46,280
guys from high school all the way on up
into their 50s or one guy that I know is

2006
01:56:46,281 --> 01:56:48,710
a huge fan. Um, you know, I don't want to,

2007
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:52,640
it's just a three of us and it's
getting a little sweaty in here already,

2008
01:56:52,641 --> 01:56:55,490
so I won't get on my knees too
much. But, uh, it's not an a,

2009
01:56:55,491 --> 01:56:57,770
it's not an exaggeration to say
that you're changing people's lives,

2010
01:56:57,771 --> 01:56:59,120
so thank you and keep it up.
I mean,

2011
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:02,830
we've had have a great effect on me
personally, so thank you. Thanks Barbara.

2012
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:04,040
Thanks for listening.
Thanks guys.

2013
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:10,820
And that wraps up the conversation and
thanks for listening and thanks to Daryl

2014
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:17,160
Cooper and Danieli Bilali for organizing
that discussion and I look forward to

2015
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:22,161
having some more of those
types of conversations in
the future about history and

2016
01:57:23,851 --> 01:57:28,851
about human nature and about leadership.

2017
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:32,520
And in the meantime, Echo. Yes.

2018
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,100
Speaking of leadership,

2019
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:40,470
if people want to lead themselves
down the right path, the path,

2020
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:45,030
yes. Do you have any maybe
recommendations for them?

2021
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:49,890
Sure, of course they do.
So we're all working out,

2022
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:55,710
right? Pretty cool every day.
Yeah. You work out every day.

2023
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:00,300
Although I got sick, he's just
straight up at arrest. Yeah. Flu,

2024
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:05,620
flu. Yeah. You know what that
is? Yeah, man, I hear bad things.

2025
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:09,800
No, it wasn't shot. Did I
didn't get that. You know,

2026
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:13,080
I hear mixed reviews about the
whole flute deal. Either way,

2027
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:15,720
you're obviously better.
You seem better and better,

2028
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:20,220
which is good because now you can get
back to working out and when you get back

2029
01:58:20,221 --> 01:58:23,190
to working out, you still want to
maintain your joints sick or not sick,

2030
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,290
maintain your joints.
That's what I think.

2031
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:29,430
I think everyone would agree with me on
that one and the way you maintained your

2032
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:33,360
joints is to take joint supplements
like Krill oil, Jocko, super krill oil.

2033
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:36,240
That's the good one. Talk with
supplements. That's right.

2034
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:41,040
Also a good supplement called joint
warfare. I take those every single day,

2035
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:42,250
every single day.

2036
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:45,160
No pressure, no slack, no
slack unless you run out.

2037
01:58:45,161 --> 01:58:48,630
But he the thing you don't have
to run out anymore. You subscribe,

2038
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:53,530
you get the subscription situation.
Everyone, 30 days, 60 days,

2039
01:58:53,531 --> 01:58:56,830
whatever, however much you
use or whatever, you've got
an estimate and then boom,

2040
01:58:56,831 --> 01:59:00,610
you do your subscription and you get one
in the mail every month. Never run out.

2041
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:02,020
Maintain the joints.
Important.

2042
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:08,220
More important than your power
mass gainer 5,000 I think so too.

2043
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:17,550
Also you want some cognitive
enhancements, which you do. You do.

2044
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:22,340
You totally do. Brothers like you
know, cell phone signals and you know,

2045
01:59:23,290 --> 01:59:28,210
pollutions, pollutants from cars.
That's a mess up your brain.

2046
01:59:28,211 --> 01:59:30,100
Sometimes you need some
cognitive enhancement.

2047
01:59:31,050 --> 01:59:35,560
Jock was another supplement called
discipline. It's a pre mission,

2048
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:38,770
cognitive hands, physical
enhancement, cognitive enhancement,

2049
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:43,090
all in one boom and it
tastes good. Boom. Take it.

2050
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:45,610
I would say take that everyday.
You take it before stuff,

2051
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,550
so you call it a pre mission
indicates you take it

2052
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:51,120
before you do something where you need,
before I do a mission,

2053
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:56,280
that mission could be going to
work with a company like, Hey,

2054
01:59:56,281 --> 02:00:00,540
I'm going to need to be on
my a game mentally because
we're solving problems for

2055
02:00:00,541 --> 02:00:02,430
digging into the leadership situations.

2056
02:00:02,431 --> 02:00:06,930
We're finding out what's going on and
the game has got a calm also Jujitsu.

2057
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:09,510
Yeah, but the people always say, well you,

2058
02:00:09,570 --> 02:00:14,490
I thought you didn't take preop workouts
and I don't, not for a workout. Oh yeah.

2059
02:00:14,491 --> 02:00:18,690
For the workouts. I mean I might do
that one out of every 10 workouts.

2060
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:22,830
Maybe even when I was 21 I take
some kind of a pre pre workout.

2061
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:25,660
Yeah.
It's

2062
02:00:25,790 --> 02:00:29,650
because when I wake up in the morning,
I'm not hungry. Yeah. Not even third. I'm,

2063
02:00:29,651 --> 02:00:31,490
I mean, I drink water, but I'm not like,

2064
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:36,740
I don't feel the need for some jack me
up during the workout and I'm just gonna

2065
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:39,680
go get it. Yeah. And you
don't really drink coffee,

2066
02:00:39,681 --> 02:00:41,960
so you don't even have that situation.
You know?

2067
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:44,750
I don't like coffee and people
will ask why I don't like coffee.

2068
02:00:44,751 --> 02:00:46,620
Don't like the taste of
it tastes horrible. Yeah.

2069
02:00:46,621 --> 02:00:49,730
So what that did is it
eat like it made you,

2070
02:00:49,731 --> 02:00:53,390
or it didn't allow you to get into the
coffee system because that's really what

2071
02:00:53,391 --> 02:00:56,900
it is that made out of and hit the call
and everyone says it's an acquired taste.

2072
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:59,150
My question is when something
is an acquired taste,

2073
02:00:59,390 --> 02:01:02,180
how many times do you have to drink
something that's socks before you're like,

2074
02:01:02,181 --> 02:01:06,700
okay, I like the smell
choir that, yeah, man. And,

2075
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:10,160
and there wasn't, to me, there was no,
it wasn't like, Hey, if I can get this,

2076
02:01:10,161 --> 02:01:14,820
if I can start liking this, yeah, I'll be,
I'll be stronger. It wasn't gonna Happen.

2077
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:16,041
It was like,
Hey,

2078
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:19,730
if I start liking this and I'll
spend $4 a day at a coffee store, no,

2079
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:22,250
not happening. Well usually,
I mean like beer, right?

2080
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:25,740
When you first drink beer typically
from the you tastes like is,

2081
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:30,230
I'm not good with any acquired taste.
No, not chocolate milk. Chocolate milk.

2082
02:01:30,231 --> 02:01:30,950
Right off the bat,

2083
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:35,650
everyone acquired immediately
acquired wait to try the milk.

2084
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:37,940
That's not an acquired taste.

2085
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:43,130
Yeah. And that's probably why you make
things taste good because you don't,

2086
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:47,510
you're not down for the whole
acquired situation. Well, okay,

2087
02:01:47,511 --> 02:01:51,890
so like beer,
coffee is the same deal because there's a,

2088
02:01:51,891 --> 02:01:56,030
there's a benefit beyond just
the taste. So beer is like, yeah,

2089
02:01:56,031 --> 02:01:59,530
you get drunk or whatever, and people
like that, but it's like Dang the beers.

2090
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:02,000
Kind of this barrier. Like I wish
it tasted better, blah blah blah.

2091
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,660
That's why they do Jello shots,
you know, just get in there anyway.

2092
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:08,060
So after a while you're like,
you know what,

2093
02:02:08,061 --> 02:02:12,560
I'll endure the taste to get a bit
of venture. You like the taste.

2094
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:15,350
You ended up liking the taste because
you can kind of recognize certain,

2095
02:02:15,351 --> 02:02:17,870
you know, it, there's all kinds
of things. Same thing with coffee.

2096
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:21,470
You kind of start to like the
taste because the originally,

2097
02:02:21,471 --> 02:02:25,010
initially you want to get the boost,
the caffeine boost.

2098
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:30,200
Well the good thing is with, with the
products that we make, there's no,

2099
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:33,650
they're not acquired taste
this taste going direct. Uh,

2100
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:36,900
a delicious can just taste
it from the get go. Yeah.

2101
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:41,900
This discipline pre mission
is no exception. Tastes
good. It's like a lemon lime.

2102
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:45,350
Is that the official flavor?
Lemon lime official. Yeah. Yeah.

2103
02:02:45,351 --> 02:02:47,780
That's a good one because
that's like a real like broad,

2104
02:02:47,781 --> 02:02:49,420
like most people are
gonna like the limit line.

2105
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:51,790
Like it takes a Weirdo
than not like lemon law.

2106
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:55,490
Not that that's a bad thing
you're probably missed,

2107
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:59,960
but nonetheless it does taste good.
I will agree with that.

2108
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:05,320
And I think it's one of those deals where
you can just take it even if it's not

2109
02:03:05,871 --> 02:03:08,360
right before some stuff I just drink it.

2110
02:03:08,361 --> 02:03:13,270
Sometimes I'm just straight up wants
something sweet, just trade out.

2111
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,550
It's all good for your brain and stuff.
Yeah, man. Is that a lack of discipline?

2112
02:03:17,450 --> 02:03:19,160
I want something sweet.
No,

2113
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:24,170
because unless it's like a
bad thing because you think
of what you want to break

2114
02:03:24,171 --> 02:03:28,660
it down. What makes something a lack
of discipline? It's like when you slit,

2115
02:03:28,661 --> 02:03:31,850
when it's like goes beyond
your intentions, right? If
you intend to do something,

2116
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:32,631
but then it's like,
oh,

2117
02:03:32,631 --> 02:03:36,080
my immediate payoff is going to kind of
get in the way or whatever, then that's,

2118
02:03:36,081 --> 02:03:37,010
that's why it's okay to be like,

2119
02:03:37,011 --> 02:03:40,520
tomorrow I'm going to
have a mint chocolate chip
milkshake. Yeah. It kinda is.

2120
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:42,440
Not Today,
tomorrow,

2121
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:46,850
but if that deviated from your original
whole plan, then it's like a discipline.

2122
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:49,220
Like if you're like, oh, I'm really
craving a shake. I won't have it today,

2123
02:03:49,221 --> 02:03:51,020
but I'll have it tomorrow.
Even though the plan is,

2124
02:03:51,021 --> 02:03:54,290
doesn't entail you having it tomorrow,
man. It's like a lack of discipline.

2125
02:03:54,290 --> 02:03:59,030
Just on a bigger scale, I guess. Or
more belong longevity scale check.

2126
02:03:59,031 --> 02:04:03,140
Nonetheless. Discipline. It's good.
It tastes good. It feels good.

2127
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,800
It won't take discipline to take
discipline. No, that's what I'm saying.

2128
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:09,530
Cause it's going to taste good.
It's gonna make your,

2129
02:04:09,531 --> 02:04:11,480
you're saying you know what
it is when you take it.

2130
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:15,070
I was talking to jade about
this. It's like the, um,

2131
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,420
you know how like when you're
searching for a word, you know,

2132
02:04:17,421 --> 02:04:19,850
when you're trying to explain something
and like let's say out of know your

2133
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:23,870
brain is off. You're hung over four year,
didn't get enough sleep, I don't know,

2134
02:04:23,871 --> 02:04:25,970
whatever. And you're searching
wall, what's that word again?

2135
02:04:26,090 --> 02:04:28,910
Or you forget someone's name,
like your friend or something like this.

2136
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:34,180
It's almost like the discipline is going
to connect those dots for you. Yeah.

2137
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:35,960
And this is what it feels like.
You don't feel like,

2138
02:04:35,961 --> 02:04:39,180
you know what you ever played
the like powerball or something.

2139
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:42,990
Will you ever seen like on the
news how they get the balls? Yeah.

2140
02:04:42,991 --> 02:04:46,230
It's like this big around cage
that they spin and all the,

2141
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:48,660
all the balls fly around in
there and then they just kind of,

2142
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:52,110
one randomly comes into the little
shoot there. It's what it feels like.

2143
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:53,790
It's like a,
that's all the words.

2144
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:59,040
It's your brain and that's all the words
and man that correct words just not

2145
02:04:59,041 --> 02:05:00,870
shoot. He's not coming in
there. You know what I mean?

2146
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:04,860
But the discipline shoots the right words
in there like no, like one speed, boom,

2147
02:05:04,861 --> 02:05:07,320
boom, boom, boom. See what I'm
saying? That's what it feels like.

2148
02:05:07,850 --> 02:05:11,400
Take this one when the lottery to check.
Yup.

2149
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:13,380
Same exact thing nonetheless as good.

2150
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:17,280
Get that@originmain.com that's
where you can get all this stuff.

2151
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:18,110
Yeah.

2152
02:05:18,110 --> 02:05:22,370
Origin labs, they're producing
it by the truckload for us.

2153
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:28,100
Also an origin main.com there's
some good keys on there.

2154
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:32,740
Really good. Gies only gives I'm
wearing now forever. Forever.

2155
02:05:32,741 --> 02:05:35,770
Straight up and they're made in America.
By the way,

2156
02:05:36,670 --> 02:05:39,430
the cottons made in
America sewn in America.

2157
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:44,170
Lu Lune is not a verb woven with looms.

2158
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:46,540
Wrong word lottery just

2159
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:53,200
moved into a verb.
Maybe that's proactive.

2160
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:58,060
It's true. See, Shakespeare made up
a word. Everyone was cool with it.

2161
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:00,520
All of a sudden that came
cool and you can make words.

2162
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:02,290
All you need is people to sign up.

2163
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:07,290
That's know the cotton is straight
up loomed in America and sold them,

2164
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:11,500
assembled in them. They're made
in America. Straight up the geese.

2165
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:15,400
This rash guards on their compression
gear, if you will, pants and tops.

2166
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:21,460
By the way, it's not just cotton, you
know? That's why it's so different. Yeah.

2167
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:26,390
Because it's, it's, it's a hybrid
blend. It's not just cotton. All right.

2168
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:31,000
So yeah, there's that. That's
why the material dries quicker.

2169
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:34,810
That's why it's antimicrobrial
type doesn't smell bad.

2170
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:37,890
That's why we're dries out quick.
That's why it's lighter because it's,

2171
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:42,910
it's made from the Getgo
for Jujitsu. Yeah. So yeah,

2172
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:45,130
and that is a big deal if you,
if you take to do too,

2173
02:06:45,131 --> 02:06:47,560
and you even just pay even that much
attention to that kind of stuff,

2174
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:50,110
it makes a difference. Yeah. And
then tried to go back to your old g,

2175
02:06:50,111 --> 02:06:54,520
you can be like, print, why did I even
do that to my origins sticking with it.

2176
02:06:54,521 --> 02:06:58,180
That's why I'm sticking with it.
Also speaking to Jiu Jitsu,

2177
02:06:58,190 --> 02:07:03,190
there's an immersion camp coming up or
August 26th through September 2nd there's

2178
02:07:05,291 --> 02:07:09,700
two, two sessions. Right?
Early, late session.

2179
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:14,380
I'm going Jackie, you going?
I am going both sessions.

2180
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:18,850
Poor Jocko was so mad he couldn't
participate last time. Yeah.

2181
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:25,260
It was almost like something was there
just bothering you the whole time? Oh No,

2182
02:07:25,261 --> 02:07:29,310
no. A lot. Yeah. Well he didn't show
it that much, but you could tell.

2183
02:07:29,610 --> 02:07:33,960
Well yeah, I wouldn't say I let it get
to me, but it definitely bothered me,

2184
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,040
which she'll every,

2185
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:38,950
every once in a while unless Jack will
be there in full effect this time.

2186
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:43,930
And uh, yeah, I'll be
there and uh, you know,

2187
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:47,650
we can immerse ourselves in Jujitsu.
That's what it is.

2188
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:52,650
It's not a bootcamp. August 26 through
September 2nd. Yeah, that's a good one.

2189
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:57,500
The origin. Yeah. So go to origin main.com
you can look at literally all of these.

2190
02:07:57,501 --> 02:08:00,700
It's immersion. It's you through
immersion camp. You can only do Jujitsu.

2191
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:03,190
How many days,
how many hours a day can you do Jujitsu?

2192
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:06,550
What in real life or in the camp?
In the camp and in real life.

2193
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:11,620
I guess technically in the camp
you can do it for 24 hours.

2194
02:08:11,621 --> 02:08:15,130
Really technically,
if you really want to know realistically,

2195
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:16,930
what do you think someone does?

2196
02:08:16,931 --> 02:08:19,750
Two or three hours in the morning and two
or three hours in the afternoon or bed,

2197
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:22,360
two hours in the morning, two hours in
the afternoon, two hours in the evening,

2198
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:26,440
six hours a day. Yeah, you'll be sore.
Yeah. If you're going getting after it,

2199
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:28,150
which you're not obligated to do,

2200
02:08:28,151 --> 02:08:32,230
but that's the freedom you have and that's
how good it is. And that's the thing,

2201
02:08:32,231 --> 02:08:36,280
man. So you know how like let's say you
for example, yeah. And you're like, Hey,

2202
02:08:36,281 --> 02:08:38,910
I want to on a rule, two hours in
the morning, two hours afternoon,

2203
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:42,550
two hours at night. I, but here's the
thing, you can't just decide to roll.

2204
02:08:42,551 --> 02:08:45,250
You got to roll with somebody.
Otherwise he just rolling by yourself.

2205
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:49,930
So that's a problem in the real world. Not
everyone, you know, but Bruh, this camp,

2206
02:08:50,150 --> 02:08:54,790
oh, every, every single time. Pining
people, by the way, all levels. Boom.

2207
02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:57,760
So yeah, get some, even if
you've never done Jujitsu,

2208
02:08:57,970 --> 02:09:02,010
ever still go and learn.
Some did to get off to too.

2209
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:06,910
It's a good way to learn the ground
running immersion. Yup. Fully.

2210
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:09,190
Yeah.
Or domain.com check.

2211
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:12,970
Look at all this stuff and you know
Dave Burke's coming by the way. Yeah.

2212
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:16,930
I'm looking forward to them
during immersion Jiu Jitsu
time. Dave Burke calls me.

2213
02:09:16,931 --> 02:09:18,760
I see his name pop on my phone.
Like you know,

2214
02:09:18,761 --> 02:09:21,240
every once in a while you'll run into
that guy who can give you that feeling

2215
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:23,980
like, oh gosh, Dave Brooks
calling me. Yeah, good deal.

2216
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:26,920
It kind of like brightens your day. Little
new. I don't know what else is coming.

2217
02:09:26,921 --> 02:09:30,670
I don't know if JP is going to come or
life. Yeah, you gotta check the schedules.

2218
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:35,920
Got It. Blocked. The F team schedules.
Yeah, that'd be good if both of them come.

2219
02:09:36,010 --> 02:09:36,431
They've been,

2220
02:09:36,431 --> 02:09:39,670
I've been noticing they'd been getting
their train on or trying to train.

2221
02:09:39,671 --> 02:09:44,230
Yeah man. That's good.
Also speaking of training,

2222
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:49,000
if you want some good fitness gear,
mix up the workout,

2223
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:52,780
keep more creative with the workout
with the movements and equipment.

2224
02:09:52,781 --> 02:09:57,670
Could have on it.com/jocko get
yourself some primal bells.

2225
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:59,620
I highly recommend,
by the way,

2226
02:09:59,621 --> 02:10:02,710
someone hit me up because we
had this conversation last time.

2227
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:05,340
You said that my workouts were boring.
Yeah.

2228
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:10,630
And someone kind of sided with
me, just so you know. Cool.

2229
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:15,740
Cause I said the workouts can be
boring if you're boring, right?

2230
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:19,930
Yeah. We sing as we did. People
sided with me. Yeah. You know.

2231
02:10:20,170 --> 02:10:22,480
Well they're right and, and
straight up. You're right.

2232
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:27,640
Because I think we kind of concluded
that to where, yeah, you know,

2233
02:10:27,850 --> 02:10:31,480
if you're boring or if you intentionally
make it boring, it's boring. That's how,

2234
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:32,820
in fact,
the board ill,

2235
02:10:32,890 --> 02:10:36,890
the boredom and the boringness of the
workout can be part of a certain type of

2236
02:10:36,891 --> 02:10:39,170
training. You know, it's like a
mental endurance training yet.

2237
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:44,030
So it's a whole big thing. And I was
irresponsible to accuse you ever do,

2238
02:10:44,050 --> 02:10:48,710
do you ever do a workout where you just
do one movement the whole the whole

2239
02:10:48,711 --> 02:10:53,450
time? No. Wait, there is some mental,
not a fool. There's some sort of like,

2240
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:56,930
there's definitely something to that
mentally. Yeah. You know, like, Oh,

2241
02:10:56,931 --> 02:11:01,370
I'm just going to do 500 repetitions
of whatever this is actually.

2242
02:11:01,850 --> 02:11:05,450
Yes, I have. It was snatch. So get
a up snack. Here's the thing though.

2243
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:08,810
It was I a bus notch?
No. Oh, barbell. Okay.

2244
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:13,910
It was a cross fit. 500
snatches it. No, it was,

2245
02:11:13,911 --> 02:11:18,890
um, that's my joke. I forget how many,
it was a dumb amount. Put it that way.

2246
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:22,910
Well, at the time I thought it was anyway,
I forget how much it was. Probably you

2247
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:28,710
too. I mean it's already done.
I think it was 200 board at FFT.

2248
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:34,900
You powered through those last five
reps though. I'm a sucker then.

2249
02:11:35,950 --> 02:11:40,250
I did it, but that was it. That's the
only thing. Super Sore the next day.

2250
02:11:40,970 --> 02:11:44,900
Yeah. But that's it. Yeah. Snatch. Let's
not just kind of a fun exercise though.

2251
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:49,240
That's the thing. Yeah. Well, well,
yeah. Even though it's really fun,

2252
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:52,910
but the movement is like, it's more
dynamic than just a, um, you know,

2253
02:11:52,911 --> 02:11:57,470
like the thing with exercises like
the snatch, if you're not focused,

2254
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:01,700
all this one's real simple.
But if you don't focus box jump.

2255
02:12:02,370 --> 02:12:04,940
If you let your mind wander
during a boss' Mexican, you know,

2256
02:12:04,941 --> 02:12:09,590
you've got an eight inch savage scarf.
Yeah.

2257
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:14,750
Yeah, very true. You ever near miss
a box jump and it like wakes you up.

2258
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:18,050
You're like, Oh man, I wasn't paying
attention. Was paid the man on that one.

2259
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:21,290
I don't do that much box jumps probably.
I used to,

2260
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:26,440
I used to box jump like a
savage check all your own.

2261
02:12:28,101 --> 02:12:31,100
Perfect.
Super stoked that I know that now.

2262
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:33,110
Nonetheless,

2263
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:38,630
there's some cool workout equipment.
Gear on.

2264
02:12:38,631 --> 02:12:43,130
They're boring workout or
not get creative. Boom,

2265
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:46,280
look on there. A lot of stuff. I was just
on their night yesterday. Day before.

2266
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:52,040
Good. Good, good website. Good Info too
by the way on it.com/jocko. Good spot.

2267
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:55,970
Good way to support.
Also when you get these books,

2268
02:12:56,150 --> 02:13:00,080
I think I'm redesigning designing
the website. Good. I think so.

2269
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:05,040
I think it's old looking one now.
Now those, it was the anticipated

2270
02:13:06,930 --> 02:13:10,610
while you trying to get around to it
rather website was old looking since day

2271
02:13:10,611 --> 02:13:14,360
one. But nonetheless. Um, anyway,

2272
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:16,010
back to the point.
Uh,

2273
02:13:16,070 --> 02:13:21,020
when you get any of the
books that we review,

2274
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:25,880
including Jockos actual
books way the word kit,

2275
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:29,960
extreme ownership, the field
manual, all these books. Look,

2276
02:13:29,961 --> 02:13:30,890
I'm going to list it on the,

2277
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:36,330
and the books are listed by
episode in the book section.

2278
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:38,760
You just click through there
when you get them. Boom.

2279
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:42,720
Good way to support takes to Amazon as
a prime. One day shipping. Boom. Good,

2280
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:46,230
good way to support to buy Yakim
through there. Good way to support.

2281
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:50,520
Also subscribe to the podcast if you
haven't already. Seems obvious. I know,

2282
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:54,810
but some people they haven't subscribed
and they're not obligated to,

2283
02:13:54,811 --> 02:13:58,440
but if you do want to support your
subscribes, good way. Also on Youtube,

2284
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:02,940
I want to say subscribe and
talking, iTunes, stitcher,
Google, play, all that stuff.

2285
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:07,560
And Youtube. So don't exclude youtube.
The video version of this podcast,

2286
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:11,880
which you've been pretty motivated on
lately. We'll say active. Sure. I don't,

2287
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:15,870
I don't count on motivation saying
I try to stick with the discipline.

2288
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:20,700
I see what she did there.
Nonetheless, I am disciplined with it,

2289
02:14:21,690 --> 02:14:25,800
but I am motivated to cause, you know,
I understand the value of excerpts.

2290
02:14:25,801 --> 02:14:29,130
Now someone emailed me the other
day, Hey, this excerpt of uh,

2291
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:33,090
not joining the military or something
about regrading that during the military.

2292
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:36,240
This is what he did. He had, I think he
had like a medical thing where it's like,

2293
02:14:36,241 --> 02:14:37,290
oh,
he couldn't pass or whatever,

2294
02:14:37,291 --> 02:14:41,280
but he still could do work
for the military in other
like, you know what I mean?

2295
02:14:41,530 --> 02:14:46,170
So it's like became like electronics
technician for the military even though he

2296
02:14:46,171 --> 02:14:49,080
wasn't in the military. Yeah,
yeah. See what I'm saying?

2297
02:14:49,081 --> 02:14:51,780
So like those little excerpts
can kind of offer this info,

2298
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:55,800
whether it be advice or just spark
other questions and people maybe they

2299
02:14:55,801 --> 02:14:56,400
wouldn't have got it.

2300
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,890
Maybe they miss that episode or
maybe they just weren't interested

2301
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:00,560
episode.

2302
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:05,560
Somebody pointed out and somebody made
a really funny meme that it showed,

2303
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:09,450
he didn't show you make an extra,

2304
02:15:09,451 --> 02:15:12,340
but it showed like someone discovering
excerpt and like, wow, this is awesome.

2305
02:15:12,341 --> 02:15:16,590
And then it said, oh no, episode
number attached to the SEC, sir.

2306
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:21,160
So meaning, Hey, glad I got the
extra. Now where can I find this?

2307
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:25,150
So in the future we may want
to add the episode number.

2308
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:30,910
Yeah. So did you know that there was a
big meme more? No, it was on the boards.

2309
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:31,960
I need more,

2310
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:37,020
I guess I can't really follow it 100%
because it was all on reddit and,

2311
02:15:37,630 --> 02:15:40,930
but I read an article about,
there was like a legit me more,

2312
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:42,600
what's a name anymore though?

2313
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:45,850
Tell me more is different memes
going back and forth at each other.

2314
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,020
But there was a me more and I've, I've
seen a funny, somebody asked me one time,

2315
02:15:50,021 --> 02:15:53,920
they had a, they had a ball cap. You ever
seen the ball caps that say, you know,

2316
02:15:53,921 --> 02:15:56,520
Vietnam War veteran or Afghanistan,

2317
02:15:57,090 --> 02:16:01,090
Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom
of war veteran or something like that.

2318
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:05,020
Someone wrote me up or sent me
a picture and said it is this,

2319
02:16:05,620 --> 02:16:08,680
is it offensive for me to wear this
hat? And the hat said, you know,

2320
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:10,810
survivor of me more.

2321
02:16:10,811 --> 02:16:14,350
And it looked like it looked like a
legit veterans at and I kind of was like,

2322
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:16,210
no man, as far as I'm
concerned, you're good.

2323
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:20,580
I don't know what you've
been through on the I,

2324
02:16:22,350 --> 02:16:24,390
I don't know what the meaning more is.
I will,

2325
02:16:24,391 --> 02:16:28,090
I'm going to look into it more on
reddit. Yeah. Tough. Rarely had

2326
02:16:28,090 --> 02:16:30,130
to do with sequels.
I can't

2327
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,290
say the whole,
I don't understand it well enough,

2328
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:35,950
but I understand it well enough
to laugh and think. It's funny.

2329
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:40,570
I think it's very compelling.
Hundred percent me more
those means are funny, man.

2330
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:44,650
Funny. That's good. That's a good thing.

2331
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:50,680
Nonetheless, excerpts. I do put
the episode on there. By the way.

2332
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:54,100
Here's the thing. When you go
and when you go to a Youtube, oh,

2333
02:16:54,101 --> 02:16:57,160
you gotta go to the read more or
something. You got to click on read more.

2334
02:16:57,310 --> 02:16:59,590
That's the thing. So it
looks like, by the way,

2335
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:03,700
I was reading youtube comments the other
day. Oh, dance. It's bold. It's a wacky,

2336
02:17:03,701 --> 02:17:08,320
wild adventure. Someone wrote, why
are we even making these comments?

2337
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:12,950
Jocko and echo. Don't even read them.
Guess what? Jocko reads on my write them.

2338
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:16,060
Dang, there you go. Me More. What's
going on? I had to do something.

2339
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:21,550
Take some, some kind of act. It's
just read the comments. Actually,

2340
02:17:21,551 --> 02:17:24,610
that makes sense. But here's the
thing about youtube comments. This is,

2341
02:17:24,611 --> 02:17:25,600
this isn't new by the way.

2342
02:17:25,601 --> 02:17:29,230
So a lot of people know this straight
where youtube comments seem to be.

2343
02:17:29,231 --> 02:17:31,450
Maybe this is probably other forums
and stuff where they get worse,

2344
02:17:31,451 --> 02:17:36,451
but youtube has the most potential for
terrible comments and for no reason to,

2345
02:17:36,731 --> 02:17:39,380
so there's isn't be,
because it's completely unregulated.

2346
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:44,470
Well you know they're words on a
Facebook comment or on a Twitter comment.

2347
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:47,960
Generally it's your purse. You're,
you're a human being. Yeah. On,

2348
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:50,440
on Youtube you're just,
you're just a, yeah,

2349
02:17:50,441 --> 02:17:54,040
you can create an account pretty easy
and they can't really think. Yeah.

2350
02:17:54,041 --> 02:17:57,370
So it's anonymous, you know, it's, you
know, close to an anonymous. So the,

2351
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:00,580
the key is,
or the kind of the thing,

2352
02:18:00,581 --> 02:18:03,640
the result is like if you're going
to read youtube comments on your,

2353
02:18:03,670 --> 02:18:08,620
your content to a, you got a got to have
fixin in real thick skin cause they get,

2354
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:13,000
it's like they're trying to hurt your
feelings. Like they're trying, you know,

2355
02:18:14,370 --> 02:18:18,790
I think they are and they can be.
And that's the thing.

2356
02:18:18,791 --> 02:18:22,480
People are creative and creativity
is just, is a really broad thing.

2357
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:26,200
And people don't, when they use
creativity to try to like try to get you,

2358
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:29,800
they can if you don't have fixed in.
And I've experienced this case,

2359
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:32,490
you don't remember when he used
to do the hand auto show. Right?

2360
02:18:32,491 --> 02:18:36,800
So that's a anytime you're doing
like comedy stuff or I dunno,

2361
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:39,280
like any kind of like
creative stuff to me,

2362
02:18:39,281 --> 02:18:44,080
your stuff now he's really hard to be
like good socks and try to like, you know,

2363
02:18:44,081 --> 02:18:47,620
so it's kind of easy. Well I think
we kind of have it easy in that way,

2364
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:51,060
in that way because if someone's like
jock was so stupid or something like that,

2365
02:18:51,130 --> 02:18:54,430
they make themselves look dumb
cause it's so obviously not stupid.

2366
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:57,850
But when you do like a comedy thing,
well at, to me anyway, I dunno.

2367
02:18:58,270 --> 02:19:02,230
So when you do like a comedy thing
or you know, something like that,

2368
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:07,260
there's something of the
nature of [inaudible] or
bikini girls doing lightsaber

2369
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:09,460
fights or something like that.

2370
02:19:10,870 --> 02:19:13,780
People were going to tear that stuff
apart and the stuff they say, it's like,

2371
02:19:13,781 --> 02:19:14,980
Dang,
I didn't even think about that.

2372
02:19:14,981 --> 02:19:18,370
But now I'm kind of have a complex about
my videos now, you know, kind of thing.

2373
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:21,310
So that's how I started
on youtube by the way.

2374
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:26,230
So I was like kind of new to youtube and
putting stuff on when he got an audit

2375
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:29,070
got shredded and the feelings,
and here's the thing too,

2376
02:19:29,071 --> 02:19:30,980
but you don't really have thick skin.

2377
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,120
I would say then that that time
it was thinner in the beginning.

2378
02:19:35,121 --> 02:19:38,360
I don't think anyone really as sick skin
unless they have the heads up going in.

2379
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:41,300
So, and here's the weird
thing. It's like most people,

2380
02:19:41,301 --> 02:19:43,610
they like it because their friends
have had natto or something like that.

2381
02:19:43,611 --> 02:19:48,030
But then one, one guy now after like
50 comments of like a hobby scoops,

2382
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:52,160
lyrics hold, there's videos is funny
or whatever. One guy says it sucks.

2383
02:19:52,170 --> 02:19:55,400
You're like, fuck, it sucks. I know
it's, you know, he gets to you.

2384
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:57,340
It's weird how that works.
Nonetheless,

2385
02:19:57,710 --> 02:20:01,490
the point is you reading the
youtube comments is a Wacky, wild,

2386
02:20:01,580 --> 02:20:05,810
bold adventure and I respect you
for going, going on that adventure.

2387
02:20:06,650 --> 02:20:09,890
Nonetheless, Joppa reads them. So
boom, question answered, right?

2388
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:13,490
Was it a question or do
they say they don't know?

2389
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:15,620
You don't use a statement
saying straight up.

2390
02:20:15,621 --> 02:20:17,300
They don't really know why
we're even writing anything.

2391
02:20:17,301 --> 02:20:20,210
Jocko and echo don't even read
these comments. Meanwhile,

2392
02:20:20,211 --> 02:20:23,630
he wrote that I was borderline like maybe
I should just respond for once and say,

2393
02:20:23,631 --> 02:20:26,300
Hey, what I'm right
here. We're eating. Yeah.

2394
02:20:26,301 --> 02:20:29,690
And the darkness that came out of the
darkness for once. Yeah. Man, that's good.

2395
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:34,490
Maybe that's another way to engage, right.
I just figured like Youtube comments,

2396
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:39,360
um, is kind of, I don't know. It's not
as authentic, you know, random. Uh,

2397
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:43,960
what is your anonymous yeah. A lot of
stuff, which is kind of a bummer. Yeah.

2398
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:45,290
Nonetheless,

2399
02:20:45,290 --> 02:20:49,790
if you want subscribe to
the Youtube Channel for the
video version and excerpts,

2400
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:50,930
which are valuable,

2401
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:55,370
I've come to know the value
of excerpts and um, you know,

2402
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:58,910
some enhance excerpts calling me enhanced.
Put some music on there,

2403
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:04,010
some text, kinetic typography. You know
what that is. Does that sound familiar?

2404
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:07,130
Well, Connecticut, I know what
that means. I know what that means,

2405
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:11,510
so I'm putting it together. Yeah, man. So
you know, Eh, when you put it on a video,

2406
02:21:11,511 --> 02:21:14,120
it's like you know the words kind
of ad and get animated on there.

2407
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:18,290
That's what it's called. Yeah. You liked
that stuff. I liked it too. It does.

2408
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:21,960
It becomes kind of captivating. Some
people aren't really good at it, man.

2409
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:26,150
They do it anyway. Nonetheless. Cool
videos on there. If you want to subscribe,

2410
02:21:26,151 --> 02:21:29,810
subscribe.
Good way to support also chocolate store.

2411
02:21:29,930 --> 02:21:34,340
It's called Jocko store.com.
It's called Jacqueline store.

2412
02:21:34,370 --> 02:21:36,860
The website is [inaudible] dot
com that's what I'm saying.

2413
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:42,140
That's where you can get your shirts.
Same Shirt Jocko wears every day.

2414
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:44,750
The victory MMA shirt. You
can get it there. Boom.

2415
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:48,770
Also discipline equals freedom.
Get after it.

2416
02:21:49,010 --> 02:21:53,660
Some bumper stickers on their decals, on
their hoodies, on their women's stuff,

2417
02:21:53,661 --> 02:21:56,900
on their patches.
Velcro beanies.

2418
02:21:57,740 --> 02:22:02,740
I haven't seen any of these guards are
on their cashmere blend directly picked

2419
02:22:05,211 --> 02:22:09,710
from the high mountains of Bulgaria.
Uh,

2420
02:22:10,340 --> 02:22:14,780
well the good news about the
nice is that they're in route,

2421
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:20,000
in route, en route, en route.
That's any car on the way.

2422
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:21,770
Straight up put in the order.

2423
02:22:22,220 --> 02:22:25,680
We came down to the all the stuff
and then they're on the way, man.

2424
02:22:25,740 --> 02:22:30,440
Straight up here. Well, you know,
Christmas is on the way, right?

2425
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:34,290
It'd be worth the wait,
I think, in my opinion,

2426
02:22:35,130 --> 02:22:39,180
unless it's called Jocko store.com
if you want something, get something,

2427
02:22:39,181 --> 02:22:42,900
check out the stuff. If you like it,
get something good way to support.

2428
02:22:43,050 --> 02:22:45,780
Also psychological warfare.
If you didn't know what that is,

2429
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:50,160
it's an album on iTunes and stitcher
and wherever you can buy mp3s.

2430
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:53,970
It's an album Jocko album with tracks,
Jocko tracks.

2431
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:56,940
I don't think you can buy mp3s
on Stitcher, by the way. Oh yeah.

2432
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:00,510
Don't go to stitcher then for good
Amazon music or something like that,

2433
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:04,350
or Google play or wherever
else you can get them.

2434
02:23:05,310 --> 02:23:09,660
You understand what I'm saying? Anyway,
it's a track with Jocko helping you. Okay.

2435
02:23:09,661 --> 02:23:12,840
When you go on your path, you have
moments of weakness. We all do.

2436
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:18,300
All of us do. Even Jocko, I think,

2437
02:23:19,710 --> 02:23:23,100
but when we, when I have
moments of weakness, you know,

2438
02:23:23,130 --> 02:23:27,270
if Jack was there to be like, hey, look,
not yell, I want Jocko yelling at me.

2439
02:23:27,271 --> 02:23:30,990
I don't want anyone yelling. Really.
Some people do. I get it. I respect.

2440
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:35,810
But personally in a lot of us don't
want Jocko yelling at us. No need,

2441
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:39,780
no need. Right. A
yellows is not impactful.

2442
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:43,810
It's a short impact. Yeah. Yeah.

2443
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:47,580
And then the gelling is kind of
like pragmatic telling me like, oh,

2444
02:23:47,581 --> 02:23:51,660
here's an actual reason why
should not mess this workout. Yup.

2445
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:55,290
And that's exactly what I should not
eat this doughnut. Exactly right.

2446
02:23:55,470 --> 02:23:56,540
That's exactly what it is.

2447
02:23:56,541 --> 02:24:00,390
One of my favorite Twitter things of all
time is that little girl from Australia

2448
02:24:00,391 --> 02:24:02,710
saying imitating me saying sugar coat.

2449
02:24:02,890 --> 02:24:07,600
It was good.
100% good.

2450
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:12,870
That's a good one. Yeah.
Notice you weren't yelling on
though. She kind of made it.

2451
02:24:13,290 --> 02:24:18,240
It's funny the way she heard it
was almost like yelling, you know,

2452
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:20,420
shoot are coded.

2453
02:24:24,650 --> 02:24:26,340
Yeah. Yeah. Very good.

2454
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:31,720
Unless it's practical Jocko telling you
practically and pragmatically why you

2455
02:24:33,541 --> 02:24:38,541
shouldn't skip to work at
why you shouldn't or why
procrastination kills you.

2456
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:40,060
So it's like you'll be like,
oh shit.

2457
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:45,280
It's almost like you gain
a deeper understanding of
the potential weakness and

2458
02:24:45,570 --> 02:24:50,220
you can get past it works a hundred
percent success rate in my experience,

2459
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:53,460
Jack. Well also you've got, if you want,

2460
02:24:53,461 --> 02:24:57,230
you can get some Jocko white tea and
you know what? Sure, it tastes good.

2461
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:59,130
Sure it's got antioxidants in it,
but let's face it,

2462
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:03,000
there's no other drink that's
guaranteeing an 8,000 pound deadlift.

2463
02:25:03,310 --> 02:25:07,750
No other drink. Not that I know. No.
So do you get some Jocko white tea,

2464
02:25:07,770 --> 02:25:11,440
get an 8,000 pound deadlift check.
Next question. A lot of people do.

2465
02:25:11,441 --> 02:25:12,830
You do all kinds of work it out.

2466
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:16,980
They try and try the
triple complex to the OB.

2467
02:25:17,010 --> 02:25:19,350
They could come up with these big plants.
Just drink Jocko white tea.

2468
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:24,020
You're there, no knees, no
need even play around. Check a

2469
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:28,870
books way. The Warrior Kid, we talk about
staying on the path. What's the path?

2470
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:31,510
A lot of people are looking for the path,

2471
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:36,790
but what if someone could
show you the path? Well,

2472
02:25:36,791 --> 02:25:37,090
the phone,

2473
02:25:37,090 --> 02:25:42,090
the fact is the path can be found and
it's simply and clearly put forward to you

2474
02:25:43,601 --> 02:25:48,601
in the way of the warrior kid books of
which there are two and they will put

2475
02:25:49,301 --> 02:25:53,830
kids on the right path is
the book everyone wishes
they had when they were kids.

2476
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:55,900
Everyone.
Everyone that's it has said to me,

2477
02:25:55,901 --> 02:25:58,810
I wish I had this when I was getting like,
yeah, me too. Me Too. I didn't have it.

2478
02:25:59,830 --> 02:26:04,830
How did just kind of wander around
trying to figure out where the path is,

2479
02:26:04,841 --> 02:26:06,370
but no,
you don't need to have that happen.

2480
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:12,280
So a lot of the path is covered in book
one, but now book two is coming out.

2481
02:26:12,310 --> 02:26:16,480
Weigh the war. Your kid too. It's called
Mark's mission. More lessons learned,

2482
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:20,050
controlling your temper,
saving money.

2483
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:22,510
How to get people to
stop making fun of you.

2484
02:26:22,511 --> 02:26:24,610
That's important to know as a little kid,
right?

2485
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:29,060
Controlling fear of failure because a
lot of kids, you don't think of this.

2486
02:26:29,290 --> 02:26:31,930
When you think of fear of failure,
you think of like an adult that say,

2487
02:26:31,931 --> 02:26:34,870
don't you know, I don't really
for new foot one step out, man,

2488
02:26:34,871 --> 02:26:36,830
that guy is afraid of failure like that.

2489
02:26:36,990 --> 02:26:40,120
That's for kids even more so kids don't
even want to try something because we're

2490
02:26:40,121 --> 02:26:41,140
going afraid they're going to look bad.

2491
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:45,040
I remember my daughter when
she was 13 my oldest daughter,

2492
02:26:45,041 --> 02:26:48,640
she was 13 years old and she was kind of
interested in something. I was like, oh,

2493
02:26:48,641 --> 02:26:51,700
why don't you try it? And she's
like, I'm too old to start.

2494
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:54,910
She's 13 you know what I mean?

2495
02:26:54,970 --> 02:26:58,240
So how do you get kids to
come over that? Well, you,

2496
02:26:58,300 --> 02:27:01,570
you introduce them to these books,
building a business,

2497
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:06,040
that's something that kids don't think
about very often. They should be,

2498
02:27:06,610 --> 02:27:08,680
they should be thinking
about starting businesses,

2499
02:27:09,010 --> 02:27:13,060
earning money when they're young. Learning
the value of money when they're young.

2500
02:27:13,180 --> 02:27:16,000
They should absolutely be learned about
this book's gonna make every kid better.

2501
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:20,620
It'll make them a warrior kid. So here's
what you do. You preorder the book.

2502
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:24,670
Now that's my recommendation marks
mission preorder the book. Now.

2503
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:28,150
There's a couple reasons
why. Number one, you don't,

2504
02:27:28,210 --> 02:27:30,400
it's happened with other
books that I've come out with.

2505
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:33,220
If you don't order it preorder,
then guess what?

2506
02:27:33,221 --> 02:27:37,090
You go to order and it's not out of stock
and then you're mad at me. Everyone's,

2507
02:27:37,091 --> 02:27:41,050
Ooh, you're supplied. Bandwidth is working
really well there, Jocko. Hey, okay,

2508
02:27:41,051 --> 02:27:44,590
I'll take ownership of that. Guess
what? Order the book and you'd have it.

2509
02:27:45,790 --> 02:27:49,150
How's that? That's my
recommendation, so if you ordered,

2510
02:27:49,151 --> 02:27:51,970
the other thing that's good
about it is if you order,

2511
02:27:51,971 --> 02:27:56,890
it spreads the word and more kids will
hear about it because there's no big

2512
02:27:56,950 --> 02:28:00,820
advertising. I just got a thing the
other day from somebody who was a tool,

2513
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:03,550
a social media, I think
it was Twitter. You know,

2514
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:04,870
you might want to check with your,

2515
02:28:04,990 --> 02:28:07,780
I don't know what your marketing
teams telling you, like, Hey,

2516
02:28:07,781 --> 02:28:11,350
I don't have a marketing team over
here to me and echo, we're kicking it.

2517
02:28:12,130 --> 02:28:14,890
So if you want to help spread
the word order the book,

2518
02:28:14,891 --> 02:28:19,891
it's due out April 24th it's
way the warrior kid to Mark's.

2519
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:26,420
And if you want to see a,
an actual warrior kid in
action, checkout Irish oaks,

2520
02:28:26,421 --> 02:28:28,820
ranch.com Aiden,
he's a warrior kid.

2521
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,850
He's only 12 years old but has his
own business speaking to businesses.

2522
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:36,860
You can get his soap that he makes from
goat milk. Very good soap by the way.

2523
02:28:36,910 --> 02:28:37,743
Yeah,

2524
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:42,830
it's got a good motto to the motto of
the soap is stay clean. Sounds simple,

2525
02:28:42,980 --> 02:28:46,580
but you know what? There's
a lot of layers there. A,

2526
02:28:46,581 --> 02:28:50,270
don't forget the discipline equals
freedom field manual eating, thinking,

2527
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:54,350
fighting, working out life.
We're talking about life.

Get the manual on how to live your life.

2529

The field manual discipline
equals freedom for the amp,

2530
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:05,450
for the audio version of that. You can't
find it on audible cause it's not there.

2531
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:09,980

2534
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:21,050

2535

combat leadership for business
and life and on top of that,

2536
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:28,700
Leif Babin and I are bringing out
the follow on to extreme ownership.

2537
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:32,030
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

2538
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:37,870
It's got knowledge and lessons learned
from the battlefield and business and

2539
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:41,750
life.
