00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,950
This is Jocko podcast number
one 75 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,560
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,150
23 October,

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,130
1942 eighth army personal
message from the army commander.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,000
When I assumed command of the eighth army,

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,670
I said that the mandate was to destroy
Rommel and his army and that it would be

7
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:29,190
done as soon as we are ready.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,160
We are ready now.
The battle which is about to begin,

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,040
we'll be one of the
decisive battles of history.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,440
It will be the turning point of the war.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,970
The eyes of the whole world will be
on us watching anxiously which way the

12
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,690
battle will swing.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,680
Okay.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,110
We can give them their answer at once.

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,110
It will swing our way.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,430
We have FirstClass equipment,
good tanks,

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,140
good anti tank guns,

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,320
plenty of artillery and
plenty of ammunition and we
are backed up by the finest

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,550
air striking force in the world.

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,850
All that is necessary
is that each one of us,

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,680
every officer in man should enter this
battle with the determination to see it

22
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:21,514
through,

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,040
to fight and to kill and finally to win.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,970
Yeah.

25
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,330
If we all do this,
there can be only one result.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,730
Okay.

27
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,350
Together we will hit the enemy
for six right out of North Africa.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,080
Okay.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,530
The sooner we win this battle, which
will be the turning point of the war,

30
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,250
the sooner we shall all get
back home to our families.

31
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,883
Therefore,

32
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,040
let every officer and man enter the
battle with a stout heart and the

33
00:01:55,111 --> 00:02:00,111
determination to do his duty as
long as he has breath in his body.

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,040
Yeah.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,510
And let no man surrender so long
as he is on wounded and can fight.

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,220
Let us all pray that the Lord Mighty
in battle will give us victory.

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,110
B L Montgomery,
Lieutenant General Eighth Army,

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,040
and that
is it.

39
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,050
Note written on the eve
of the battle of Al Ameen,

40
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,690
which ended up being the turning
point of the war in North Africa.

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:38,900
Okay.

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,840
In general,
Bernard Montgomery,

43
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,860
commonly referred to as Monte
defeated the Desert Fox Rommel,

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,820
one of the most respected
generals in all of history really.

45
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,940
And Monte was a actually a controversial
figure and I think he got more

46
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:04,990
controversial, the more famous he
got. He fought in world war one.

47
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,660
Okay.

48
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,550
He was a soldier. He was gravely wounded
by a sniper in the battle of, he prays,

49
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:12,690
he was shot in the lung.

50
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,830
He was in such bad shape that
they actually dug a grave for him.

51
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,450
But somehow he pulled through,
he recovered,

52
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,080
he served the rest of the
war as a staff officer.

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,800
And he was actually very critical of the,

54
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,840
of the tactics and of the strategy and
have the willingness of the leadership to

55
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:38,841
accept such horrific and
heinous levels of casualties.

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,910
So he was critical of that. And
after the war was over, he served,

57
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:48,420
he stayed in the army, he served
in Palestine, he served in India.

58
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,190
And then in 1939 of course there was more
war and he was in command of the third

59
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:58,831
division.

60
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:03,570
He went to France and he was actually
pretty worried about going to France.

61
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:05,310
He didn't feel super confident about it.

62
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,490
And he returned home with the rest of
the British forces that were driven off

63
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:12,690
the content continent
from Dunkirk.

64
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,650
And you know,
they're,

65
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,160
they were able to refit to be able to
go out and reengage and he headed to

66
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:24,630
Africa next. And the eighth army
was pretty beat down at that point.

67
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,620
When he showed up though,

68
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:30,621
he turned around their morale and made
them believe that they could win and won

69
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,890
the first major land victory of the
war in the second battle of El Alamein.

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,400
From there he helped the invasion of
Sicily and Italy and then he commanded all

71
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:54,000
forces, all ground forces on d day.
He commanded all the ground forces.

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,630
So that was obviously a massive operation.

73
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,590
He planned and led
operation market garden,

74
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,090
which was the invasion of low countries.

75
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:07,440
And we've covered some of those battles
on this podcast because it was not good.

76
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,920
It didn't go well and he was
kind of a guy pushing that.

77
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,570
But he was able to redeem himself from
that during the battle of the bulge,

78
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:20,010
which we've also covered on this podcast.
So you know,

79
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,860
he had some ups and downs,
but mostly ups.

80
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,220
So what was the controversy or what's
this kind of tainted image of him?

81
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,870
First of all,
some people saw him as being arrogant

82
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,890
and some of the people that saw him
as being arrogant. We're Americans,

83
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,090
Americans like patent. And
Bradley and I mean, let's face it,

84
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,030
if you're talking about for sure patent,

85
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,750
we're not talking about
a guy with a small ego.

86
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,090
So you can imagine that when you have
a clash of Egos that can be, you know,

87
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,100
when you can get some
professional jealousy and whatnot.

88
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,320
Even Sir Winston Churchill
said that Monte was,

89
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:01,310
and this is a good quote in defeat
on beatable in victory, unbearable.

90
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,600
So there's another,

91
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,630
an anecdote about him where he was asked
to name three great generals and he

92
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:15,910
said the other two would be Alexander
the great and Napoleon meaning he's just

93
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,510
on top of the list.
So he may have had,

94
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,660
it may have been a little
bit egotistical and, and,

95
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,700
and I think from what I've read about him,
he lacked,

96
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,740
lacked tact

97
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,830
and later on in life he was kind of
contract. He was controversial as well.

98
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,630
He was very critical of
American tactics in Vietnam.

99
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,630
He said that America had no clear cut
objective in Vietnam, which, you know,

100
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm critical of the tactics in Vietnam.

101
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,190
I think it's pretty safe to say that
there should've been more clear cut

102
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,720
objective that that obviously made some
of our military leadership in America

103
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:58,280
angry. I don't know if I would
argue against those statements. He,

104
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,750
he oddly enough,

105
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:04,751
spoke positively about the Chinese
communist government when he was older.

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,080
He, he publicly supported
apartheid in South Africa.

107
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,300
So these are more things that people
sort of sort of tainted his image.

108
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,990
But besides all that,

109
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:22,640
he is still known as a,
as a,

110
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,720
as a tactician.

111
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,650
And there's plenty of support
from his troops and his men that,

112
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:31,580
that loved him and were
ready to follow him anywhere.

113
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:35,420
And there's some people that
say even that he acted arrogant.

114
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,250
It was almost like a show that he put
on to kind of unify as troops that this

115
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,210
was Monte, this was the great guy.
And we're just, we're, we got,

116
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,110
look what Monte did, you know,
so there's that. He wrote a lot.

117
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,550
He spoke, he wrote, well,

118
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:54,551
he's got some great some documents
that he put out and I one on one.

119
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,990
He's got a ton that you put out. One
of them I'm going to read. It's a very,

120
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,270
it's a very interesting piece in,

121
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,300
and so he wrote this after Germany had
surrendered and the British occupation

122
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:11,990
forces were in place in Germany.

123
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,980
So you've got the Brits there in
Germany occupying the country.

124
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:19,250
You've got the German civilians
who had been defeated in war.

125
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,860
And here we go to this message
that he wrote, 10 June,

126
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:26,750
1945 Germany,

127
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,700
personal message from the commander in
chief to the population of the British

128
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:35,210
area in Germany.
You have wondered,

129
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:40,130
no doubt why our soldiers do not smile
when you wave your hands or say good

130
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,440
morning in the streets or
play with the children.

131
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,580
It is because our soldiers
are obeying orders.

132
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,530
You do not like it,
nor do our soldiers.

133
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,890
We are naturally friendly and people,

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,330
but the orders were necessary.
And I will tell you why.

135
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,140
In the last war of 1914
which your rulers began,

136
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,040
your army was defeated,
your generals surrendered,

137
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,740
and the peace treaty of Versailles,

138
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,780
your rulers admitted that the guilt
of beginning the war was Germany's,

139
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,170
but the surrender was made in France.

140
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,020
The war never came to your country.

141
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,490
Your cities were not damaged like the
cities of French, France and Belgium,

142
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,480
and your armies marched
home in good order.

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,433
Okay.

144
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,760
Then your rulers began to spread the
story that your armies were never really

145
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:44,761
defeated and later they denied the
war guilt clauses of the peace treaty.

146
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,350
They told you that Germany was
neither guilty nor defeated,

147
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,680
and because the war had
not come to your country,

148
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,730
many of you believed it and you cheered
when your rulers began another war

149
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,860
again, after years of waste
and slaughter and misery,

150
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,540
your armies have been defeated
this time.

151
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,480
The allies were determined that
you should learn your lesson.

152
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,520
Not only that you have been defeated,
which you must know by now,

153
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
but that you your nation.

154
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,860
We're again guilty of beginning the war

155
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,930
for if that is not made clear
to you and your children,

156
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,030
you may again allow yourselves to be
deceived by your rulers and led into

157
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:37,890
another war.
During the war,

158
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,000
your rulers would not let you know
what the world was thinking of you.

159
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,480
Yeah.

160
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,880
Many of you seem to think that
when our soldiers arrived,

161
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:49,090
you could be friends with them at
once as if nothing much had happened,

162
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,490
but too much has happened for that.

163
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,430
Our soldiers have seen their comrades
shot down their homes and ruins their

164
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,080
wives and children hungry.

165
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,930
They've seen terrible things in many
countries where your rulers took the war.

166
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,600
Okay?

167
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,040
For those things, you will say, you are
not responsible. It was your rulers,

168
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,150
but they were done by the German nation.

169
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,280
Every nation is responsible for its
rulers and while they were successful,

170
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,170
you cheered and laughed.

171
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,760
That is why our soldiers
do not smile at you. This,

172
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,710
we have ordered this.
We have done to save yourselves,

173
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,190
to save your children,
to save the world from another war.

174
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,170
It will not always be so for we are
Christian forgiving people and we like to

175
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,130
smile and be friendly.

176
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,870
Our object is to destroy
the evil of the Nazi system.

177
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,450
It is too soon to be sure
that this has been done.

178
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,540
You are to read this to your children.

179
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,150
If they are old enough and
see that they understand,

180
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,640
tell them why it is that the
British soldier does not smile.

181
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Bl Montgomery Field Marshal
commander in chief British area.

182
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,900
So obviously that message was produced
in German and in English and spread out

183
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,250
amongst the population.

184
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,520
I thought that was a pretty awesome
outlook and he also spoke and wrote a fair

185
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:37,430
amount about leadership

186
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,750
and I think when you look at
his writing in his speeches,

187
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,330
you can see some of his,

188
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,450
some of his peculiarities, some of his
personality shines through sometimes.

189
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,440
And I want to take a look at some of that.

190
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,350
Some of the things that he wrote.

191
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,770
And the first piece is
called military leadership.

192
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,020
And it's actually from a speech that he
gave at the University of St Andrews 15

193
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:15,870
November, 1945 it's like a
transcript or maybe it's as notes,

194
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,580
I'm not sure which,
but it's,

195
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,070
it's written as if he was reading it.
So

196
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,960
here we go. Let's go to this
book. Military leadership.

197
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,900
I've come here to take to talk
to you about military leadership.

198
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,930
A subject such as this must in normal
times seems somewhat remote from this

199
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,000
quiet gray walled city by the sea.

200
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,260
Today I have to try and equate
the definition of military
leadership as I see it

201
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,160
to the lessons of the past and
to the experience of the present.

202
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,180
I proposed to limit myself in
this talk to higher leadership,

203
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,810
the command of armies or a group of
armies and not to consider the quality of

204
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,530
leadership at lower levels.

205
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,530
What I say about higher leadership
may well have certain application to

206
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:11,300
leadership of a brigade or a company
or a section of men. There are,

207
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:11,691
however,

208
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:15,860
certain differences in leadership at
lower levels and I do not propose to take

209
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:19,280
up your time by discussing these today.
Now you'll see as he goes into this,

210
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:23,120
he covers these talking about that all
the time. I'm not sure even why he,

211
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,043
he did that,

212
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,710
but he talks about the the the entire
chain of command throughout this speech.

213
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,100
Military leadership is a subject which
has always interested me and during this

214
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:37,490
war I have had some opportunity
to put my ideas to the test.

215
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,820
I have found that if you
aspire to lead soldiers,

216
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,060
you must take a close study of human
nature for that as the raw material with

217
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,670
which a commander has to achieve his end.

218
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,410
If you neglect human factor as a leader,
you will fail.

219
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,690
The personal relationship between the
commander and his soldiers is and always

220
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:04,691
has been one of the most potent single
factors in making for success in war.

221
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,780
If a commander has the complete
confidence and trust of his men,

222
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,250
there is nothing.
He cannot do nothing.

223
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,390
If a commander loses the
confidence of his men,

224
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,910
he cannot succeed.

225
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,330
Yeah.

226
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,190
That's a bold statement right there.

227
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,870
That's a bold statement right there and
something that I talk about all the time

228
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,170
and there's two. There's,
there's two words that I use
interchangeably. I should,

229
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,810
I should use them more interchangeably.
More often.

230
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,830
I talk about relationships a lot and the
word that I should use intermixed with

231
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:44,180
that 50% of the time is trust.
Cause to me trusting relationships,

232
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,530
it's kind of the same thing.
If you don't have trust,

233
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,840
you don't have a relationship. Yeah.
If you don't have a relationship,

234
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:53,010
then you don't have trust. But they
do have different meanings, right?

235
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,550
So it's important to me to establish that.

236
00:15:56,551 --> 00:16:00,390
And the reason that I bring that up
is because if you're in a leadership

237
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:04,050
position and you're breaking the
trust that you have with your men,

238
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,560
that is going to be a real problem.
Yeah. So you could say, well,

239
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:08,700
you don't have a good
relationship with them,

240
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,060
but you could not have a good relationship
with someone and they could still

241
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:12,600
trust you.

242
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,370
You could not have a good relationship
with someone and you hadn't broken their

243
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:19,410
trust.
It's going to be hard if you break your,

244
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,300
their trust to have a
good relationship with.

245
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,800
But the key factor here is
trust and confidence of the men.

246
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,791
Back to the book.
Now,

247
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:36,791
let us consider on what a man's power to
lead others is based is necessary first

248
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,040
to define what is meant by leadership.

249
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,780
And this is where this
gets a little interesting.

250
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,230
I suggest to you as the
definition of the word leadership,

251
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,820
the will to dominate together
with the character, which,

252
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,680
which inspires confidence.
The measure of a man's ability to lead,

253
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,300
I think is twofold.

254
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,020
So the first part of the definition of
leadership and his mind is the will to

255
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,570
dominate. Hmm. Which is we're just,

256
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,530
we just stuck and you're going to see
where he kind of counters that and he

257
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:09,620
talks about,
he talks about decentralized command.

258
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,170
He talks about everything that
that I believe in. But you know,

259
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:14,330
I don't talk about, hey, as a leader,

260
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,270
it's first and foremost that you have
to will to dominate other humans. Right?

261
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,090
That's not, in fact, I think that's
a kind of a negative quality.

262
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,730
But that being said,

263
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,650
if you have someone that
doesn't mind not winning,

264
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,220
not dominating, well then guess what?
They're not going to put forth any effort.

265
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,580
They're not going to make things
happen like force of will.

266
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:43,040
I talk about that all the time.
You, you, you have to import.

267
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,630
You have to have the force of
will to make things happen.

268
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,700
Sometimes you just have
to make things happen.

269
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,070
They're not going to happen by themselves.

270
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,960
Anything that's anything that's
going to come that's good in life.

271
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:55,030
It's not going to happen by itself is
just not going to wake up and it's there.

272
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,400
Like, like an Easter egg
that's not happening. Oh No.

273
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,170
You've got to go out and you
gotta make it happen. Yeah. Okay.

274
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:05,010
Maybe you get an Easter egg when
you're six years old lawyer.

275
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,070
Once you're 26 years old,
there's no Easter eggs coming to you.

276
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,380
You got to make them okay.
Yeah. Back to the book.

277
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:17,730
First, it lies in his will to dominate
the men and events which surround him,

278
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,480
the will to drive himself and his men
to the limit of their powers for a

279
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:26,010
specific purpose and the refusal to
allow anything to divert him from his aim

280
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,180
again, you're going to see where that
sounds so strong. It sounds unbalanced,

281
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:33,030
right? It sounds, it sounds like he's
outside the dichotomy of leadership.

282
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,720
He's going too far in one direction
is being extreme like nothing.

283
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,850
You're going to refuse to allow
anything to divert you. Oh, okay.

284
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,130
So does that mean that mean
you get everyone killed?

285
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,470
That's what they did in World
War One and he didn't like that.

286
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,510
But you're going to see where he balances
out these statements later. Second,

287
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:51,630
it lies in the strength of his character,
whether good or evil,

288
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,650
to inspire others to place their complete
trust and confidence in him and his

289
00:18:55,651 --> 00:19:00,651
ability to lead them with success and
to infuse his men for the task in hand.

290
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,500
This ability of a man to
inspire confidence in others
and to create enthusiasm

291
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,510
is a spiritual quality,
but it is not,

292
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,520
but it is well to remember that this
quality need not necessarily be for good.

293
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,880
The evil leader has equally the ability
to inspire confidence in others and in

294
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:22,911
history.

295
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:27,500
The evil leader has often at
any rate temporarily prevailed

296
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,020
and he counters that at the end too.
There have been many with different,

297
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,820
with different types of characters,

298
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,700
character who have inspired
men to follow them.

299
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,320
I proposed to choose three great captains
of the past and examine briefly why

300
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:47,800
these men were leaders and how they lead
their men and how as leaders that they

301
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:51,250
succeeded or fails. So he's going
to go into a little case study,

302
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:52,390
a couple of pages here.

303
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,320
I will first consider Moses.

304
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,270
He was already old when he was called to
lead the children of Israel out of the

305
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:04,150
land of Egypt.
His task was an immense one.

306
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,650
He had first to inspire his people to
cast off the yoke of the Egyptians.

307
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,840
This was no easy matter.

308
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,070
Israel had been living for about 400
years as slaves of the Egyptians.

309
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,860
They had lived in the Nile delta,

310
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:22,861
a bad climate and one which tends
to SAP up energy and initiative,

311
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,170
but they lived where food was plenteous.
While all around were deserts,

312
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:30,640
which could barely support life.

313
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,900
Moses must've had to overcome the most
tremendous initial inertia to persuade

314
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:38,590
Israel to launch out into those
deserts with all the risks of famine,

315
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:43,591
disease and the necessity to fight his
power to inspire and dominate his fellow

316
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:48,640
men must have been of a very
high. Now see, that's where I dis,

317
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,660
I don't look at that as domination
of your fellow man. You're, I look,

318
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,450
I see the inspiring part, but
I'm not looking at it. Hey,

319
00:20:55,451 --> 00:21:00,370
we are looking to dominate.
I see his angle, right?

320
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,320
I see. I see what he's, I see
where he's coming from, but,

321
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,310
and maybe that word, you know, words
change words, Murph morph over time.

322
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,170
Maybe that word dominate that he's using.
Maybe.

323
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Maybe it had less of a
sting to it then you know,

324
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,970
50 years ago possibly hadn't a listing.

325
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,620
70 years of words change
words change over time,

326
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,360
but that's what he's saying.

327
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,630
But things were kind of
hardcore to right back then.

328
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,480
You know how like long time ago
they're just things in general.

329
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,050
We're a little bit more blunt.
Yeah. So maybe the Times, Moses,

330
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:42,190
I'm sure they were pretty blunt and even
this time. Yeah. I don't know though.

331
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,290
I'm not,
I'm not 100% sure.

332
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,130
I'm not 100% sure if he means the
word dominate the way we think of it,

333
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,750
the way I think of it,
apparently not.

334
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,270
I mean it seems like there's a
little bit more to it, I guess.

335
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:00,220
Well when he counted and
you'll hear him counter.

336
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,780
I guess that's what maybe makes me think,

337
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:06,781
maybe he means it a little bit less severe
maybe because he starts to talk about

338
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:11,680
the, the balance of this dichotomy,
because let's face it, hey, okay.

339
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,200
Let me ask you this question here.
This one is gonna make it real easy.

340
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,730
If I was a type of person that was like a,
I'm looking to dominate you,

341
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,230
come with me into the desert where
we're going to have to live with,

342
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:26,410
as we're going away from the Nile River
and we're going out to this barren area

343
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,380
where there's not a lot of food and I'm
going to have a domineering personality

344
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,160
and I'm gonna be all over you every day.
How enticing is that? Not Very. Not Very.

345
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,610
Now, if I was inspiring and
I said, listen, Echo, we're
going to get out there.

346
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,900
We're going to train, we're going to
come back. We're gonna get our revenge.

347
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,630
It's going to take some time, but
we're gonna make it. You're like that.

348
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,910
That's different, right? Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,450
So yeah.
You know what?

350
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:50,640
Now that I'm thinking about it would
dominate like what's the root word of

351
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,540
dominant? You know what it could be. Yeah.

352
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,660
I should have studied the etymology before
we got on this podcast. I apologize.

353
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,390
You know what? It could
be though. Picture,

354
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,270
when you have a good leader that dominates
the room, right? Right, right. Yeah.

355
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,570
That's a positive thing, right? So this
guy just get you. Oh yeah. You know,

356
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,850
Echo came in for the meeting. He just
dominated the world. He did great. Right?

357
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,430
That's a positive thing. So maybe
he means it that way. Unfortunately,

358
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,430
he talks about dominating the wail of,
right?

359
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:20,970
He talks about dominating the
men and events that surround him.

360
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,980
I don't know. Actually. It doesn't
talk about dominating the will,

361
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,180
so maybe that's what they mean.

362
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:27,610
Maybe he means just like
this dominating presence.

363
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,750
All right.
Going back to the book without a doubt.

364
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:35,440
Moses realized that when
he led Israel out of Egypt,

365
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,610
they were useless as a fighting people.
They had been slaves for some 400 years.

366
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,760
He therefore set to work to train them
for the task and to forge the weapon

367
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,100
which would conquer Canaan.
It's interesting,

368
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:53,210
he talks about the training
of armies as forging weapons,

369
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,700
like you're forging this weapon.
I think that's a pretty cool analogy.

370
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,900
I believe that Moses intentionally kept
Israel for 40 years in the desert for

371
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:04,670
two generations in order to breed
and train a fighting race capable of

372
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:07,820
undertaking the task of
conquest which lay at hand.

373
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:14,470
And in that 40 years he taught them
gradually how to fight and conquer.

374
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,420
He took meticulous care
over there training and it
is most interesting to note

375
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:22,870
his refusal ever to risk
any failures into action.

376
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:25,540
This is interesting and he brings
us up quite a bit. So Moses,

377
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,820
Moses didn't take any risk of where
he was, thought he might fail.

378
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,760
We read of him soon after leaving Egypt,

379
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,720
asking if he might lead Israel through
the country of another people on being

380
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:40,510
refused permission.
He marches round by another way,

381
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,760
but later when the same situation arises,
when Israel is better trained to fight,

382
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,940
he leads his people straight through the
middle of that country and destroys his

383
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:52,180
enemy utterly.

384
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,730
He was a good judge of what Israel was
capable of doing and what Israel was not

385
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,740
capable of doing.
And as a result,

386
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,860
he had an unbroken record
of military successes.

387
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,780
He had the wisdom and the insight into
human nature to realize that the best way

388
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:12,760
for a leader to gain confidence of his
soldiers is to give them victories.

389
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,190
If a commander gives his soldiers
victories, they will follow him anywhere.

390
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,060
But Moses was not permitted to see
the few fruits of his own work.

391
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:27,230
He sinned by claiming as his own powers,
which did not belong to him.

392
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:29,420
And for this sin of presumption,

393
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:34,421
he was forced to hand over to Joshua the
final conquest of Canaan for which he

394
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,560
had so well trained
the children of Israel.

395
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:41,340
So there he wraps up on on Moses,
eh?

396
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,410
I think that, and he kind of refers
back to this point later in the,

397
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,360
in this book is the fact that you
got to be, you know, you gotta,

398
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,390
you gotta push for victory, right? You
got to push for victory and this is,

399
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,810
it's almost like risk aversion,
right?

400
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,290
Which I'm not a fan of and
you can't be risk averse,

401
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,000
but you got to be calculated

402
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,780
back to the book.

403
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,990
And then the next section he
is going to talk about chrome.

404
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,830
Well he just refers to him as Carl Unwell.
Oliver Cromwell,

405
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,460
Cromwell who wasn't an English

406
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,090
statesmen but he was a soldier.

407
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,480
This is like in the 1600 1620s
he was a hardcore puritan

408
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,460
and he organized military forces in the,

409
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,980
when the civil war broke out,

410
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,970
1642 he was the deputy
commander of the new model army.

411
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,020
He defeated the main royalist

412
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,700
in 1645 and then he commanded campaigns
in Ireland and Scotland and the 1650s

413
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,663
he was,

414
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,140
he was kind of a over the top,
I guess you might say in some ways he eat,

415
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,800
I mean beyond that he, he mass and
him, there was an Irish massacre,

416
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,400
you know, and that spiraled into
a war for hundreds of years.

417
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,410
And,
and ultimately as a politician,

418
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,940
once he kind of got done with a war
part, he became a politician. He end,

419
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:18,690
he really didn't do a great job.

420
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,310
So that's just some kind of
highlights of Oliver Cromwell.

421
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,710
But here we go back to the book I next
proposed to consider Cromwells another

422
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:33,711
leader who went to wage war only
when he was over middle age.

423
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,570
He was over 40 when the
civil war broke out.

424
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,500
He started the civil war in command of
a troop of 60 men and then commanded of

425
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:41,310
that troop.

426
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:46,110
He fought at edge hill there in spite
of the parliamentary superiority and men

427
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:50,610
and guns and a free fervently held
cause he saw the failure of his own side

428
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:51,690
disease,
the victory.

429
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,820
And s and he saw them escape defeat only
because of the folly of their opponents.

430
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,820
This gave him much cause for thought

431
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,440
superiority in men and equipment was
clearly valueless unless something further

432
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,010
was added.

433
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,010
This is a part that I kind of got
fired up for what was needed also.

434
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,660
So besides guns,

435
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,720
good superiority in magnet
superiority equipment.

436
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,880
What was needed also was the leader
who would forge the weapon out of the

437
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:28,881
enthusiastic material available and
would then lead it with vigor and

438
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:33,750
determination determination to achieve
his military. And so once again,

439
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:38,130
we're talking about what leader can
take this glut leader can forge a weapon

440
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:38,970
from men

441
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,710
he saw to the nature of the weapon
required and how it could be forged.

442
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,730
So he started to understand the the men
as a weapon and how you could forge this

443
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:51,564
weapon properly.

444
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,840
And he set himself to task to the
task of building a force after his own

445
00:28:57,391 --> 00:29:01,620
principles based on a high
fighting spirit spirit,

446
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,120
good discipline,
and a sound knowledge of tactics.

447
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,180
It was to be a force which would of
have complete confidence in him as their

448
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:16,800
commander. So this guy saw this
situation where they almost got crushed.

449
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,390
The parliamentary forces were so
disorganized that they couldn't even take

450
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:23,040
advantage of it and he saw,
okay,

451
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,520
this is my opportunity and
those are great lessons.

452
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:29,460
I love it when you learned the lesson
that you didn't really have to pay for.

453
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,510
It happens sometimes.

454
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:34,830
It happens in MMA sometimes where you guy
wins a fight because something you get

455
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:37,080
lucky in the end and you
get to know we've got the w,

456
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,340
but we also got to learn a great,

457
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,860
a great lesson that happened
in combat all the time.

458
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,180
You come back off an operation
and you're like, man,

459
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:47,230
if we would have gotten hit
at this particular moment,
we had security was down.

460
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:49,930
We were not paying attention.
We didn't have this Flint covered.

461
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,040
And by the grace of God,
we didn't get contacted from that area.

462
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,510
But we can't let that happen again.

463
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:58,210
So sometimes you learn a lesson even
though you didn't have to pay for it.

464
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:01,240
And that's what it sounds like
happened here. The back of the book,

465
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,100
he said about his task full.
We are told of a furious zeal,

466
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,670
a fire in his belly which compelled to
him which compelled to others to follow

467
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:13,300
him. He had complete confidence in
his ability to gain success in war.

468
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,510
He saw the way in which he had to train
his men to fight and the few essential

469
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:23,020
oils which would ensure success provided
his men had the right fighting spirit.

470
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,140
Edge Hill was fought in October,
1642 with chrome,

471
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:32,140
well as a captain of a
troupe of horse 60 strong.

472
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,480
By January,

473
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,460
1644 he was a lieutenant general second
in command of Manchester's army of the

474
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,600
eastern counties,

475
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,960
the leading cavalry commander on the
parliamentary side and the one outstanding

476
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:48,820
commander in the parliamentary army.

477
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,380
So he made a rapid transition.
Now he gets into this.

478
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,300
Cromwell was not a likable man.
He was quick tempered,

479
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,510
believed in rigid discipline and constant
training and he drove his men hard,

480
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,090
but he believed with a blinding certainty
in the righteousness of his cause.

481
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,680
He enthused his soldiers
with its righteousness and
he was convinced of his own

482
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:17,320
ability to succeed,
to achieve success in battle.

483
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,410
This is one of those
things where you know,

484
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:25,411
when you hear that people that Monte
was a little bit like lack of tact,

485
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,480
is one of those things where I think,
well, did he read this? You know,

486
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:31,120
did he read about chrome will and
study crumble and say, well look,

487
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:34,270
no one likes chrome. Well, that's
okay. You can still be a good leader.

488
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:37,120
You don't have to be liked. In
fact, Lafe we'll tell the story.

489
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:41,800
There was a guy that was,
was Leif was teaching a class,

490
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,030
two young seals, and there was a seal
officer that would come in and say,

491
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,470
you shouldn't be liked if you're in charge

492
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,460
and laughs. You know, we'd sit in the
back of the room and think to himself,

493
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,640
this is not good, because that's
not true. It's not true. Now,

494
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,390
it's probably true that what the
guy was trying to say is, listen,

495
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,550
you're not always going
to be popular for you to,

496
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,330
your goal should not be to be like,
which I agree with,

497
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,480
but to say, look, you're going
to be hated by your troops.

498
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,880
That's just the way it is. That's
wrong. If you're hated by your troops,

499
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:18,720
you're probably doing something wrong.
Yeah.

500
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,980
And to say that if you're essentially the
what the guy that leaves talking about,

501
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,390
if he's saying, if you're liked by your
troops, you're doing something wrong,

502
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,970
kind of living. Yeah, that's
true too. What it feels like. So,

503
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,620
so I understand that thought as well.
Like,

504
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,950
Hey, everyone loves me. I must be doing
a good job. It's like, no, actually,

505
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,320
if everyone just thinks you're their
buddy, that's a problem. So that this,

506
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:46,480
this may have been what this officer
was trying to teach to the, uh,

507
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,850
to the young officers that that life
was in charge of instructing. Yeah.

508
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,290
I'm sure he tried to, was trying
to say the right thing. Yeah.

509
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,950
But perhaps he wasn't articulating it.
Yeah.

510
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,010
100% in the most clear way with
a guy cause just to sell, hey,

511
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,610
you're not going to be liked
where you're an officer. Not True,

512
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,850
not true and not good.
If I have,

513
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,120
if I look at a seal platoon and the
seal platoon doesn't like their officer,

514
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,150
that's not a positive sign. That does
not mean that guy's a good leader.

515
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:18,530
Now it's also not a good sign. If all
the soup tune, everyone loves him.

516
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,220
That doesn't mean it's good, good platoon
either. Yeah. So you can be loved,

517
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:26,900
but you're not doing a good job. You can
be hated and you can beat a good job,

518
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,210
but you're probably not gonna be able
to pull off doing a good job when guys

519
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:32,150
don't like you. They're not going to
put forth any real effort to yeah.

520
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,140
To make you look good is basically
what they're doing. Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:37,160
And at the end of the day,

522
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:41,620
it obviously seems like it's just not
that cut and dry like that, you know?

523
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,850
No. Back to the book. And
he did achieve success.

524
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,080
He had no failures.

525
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,940
And if a commander has a righteous
cause and gives his soldiers success,

526
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,340
he will gain the complete
confidence of his men.

527
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,660
And then there is nothing he can not do,
but the power.

528
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,360
Okay.

529
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,120
Which his prowess in the
field had one for him,

530
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,870
led chrom well to seize the
reins of government for himself,

531
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,490
he became impatient with
the inefficiency methods.

532
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,260
Inefficiency of the
parliamentary government of
those days and he compared it

533
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,910
unfavorably with his own ability as a
soldier to give immediate decision and to

534
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:25,490
see it take shape at once.
Inaction.

535
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,210
So you took over the government and
he wanted things to move real quick,

536
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,010
but unfortunately,

537
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:39,010
but as in battle, he had been sure
of the correct course of action.

538
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,260
So in the political field,
he was on many occasions,

539
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,430
uncertain and perplexed during the
period in which he ruled England,

540
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,240
he tried out five different systems
of government and all failed.

541
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:56,050
And at the end he was governing alone
and much more absolutely than ever.

542
00:34:56,051 --> 00:35:00,310
Charles had attempted to rule internally.
He tax the people more highly,

543
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:03,550
any disregarded parliament,
more brazenly than Charles never done.

544
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,080
And he interfered with the
personal liberty. More Toronto stay

545
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,180
in Ireland. Also, his harsh and
cruel policy left a lasting hatred,

546
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,190
which the centuries have not quenched,

547
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,490
but his rule was not wholly unproductive.
He made the fighting starts.

548
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:21,850
So he did accomplish one thing.

549
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,140
He made the fighting services the finest
in the world and he gained for England

550
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:29,500
a voice in the affairs of Europe such
as England, had never had before,

551
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,110
so he was not a good governmental leader.

552
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,273
Yeah,

553
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:39,370
many of his triumphs abroad were transient
in ups and unsubstantial and much

554
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,990
that he attempted at home
disappeared when he died,

555
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,150
but he's worked for the navy and it's
initial steps toward the creation of an

556
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:51,990
empire, planted a foundation
from which much has grown, so

557
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,350
he had a good impact on the military,

558
00:35:55,351 --> 00:36:00,351
but as governmental governmental leading
abilities aren't all that strong.

559
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:08,010
The third great captain I suppose to I
proposed to consider is Napoleon a leader

560
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:11,590
driven by selfish and evil ambition.

561
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,710
It's interesting and not like the
other two in pursuit of a great ideal,

562
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:20,080
unlike the other two,
he was a soldier by profession,

563
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,450
trained from his youth and
the profession of arms.

564
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:26,380
Even as a very young boy in a military
academy, he was clearly a leader.

565
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,990
He wished to dominate and he did
dominate his fellow men. There it is.

566
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,700
That one sounds a little stronger.
That's all.

567
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,620
A little bit more like what
I think of dominate. Again,

568
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,361
unlike the other two,

569
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:43,780
he rose at a very early age to
a high and independent command.

570
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:48,781
At the age of 26 he took command of the
army of Italy and army inferior numbers

571
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:54,421
and equipment to its opponents and
semi muteness from lat lack of pay,

572
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,630
yet within a year with this inferior
weapon which he reforged to his liking,

573
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,750
he fought brilliantly,

574
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,290
brilliantly successful campaign in the
northern Italy and imposed piece on his

575
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:08,110
enemy.
I liked that imposed piece on his enemies.

576
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:13,270
From the moment of his arrival with
his army. He dominated his troops,

577
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:17,890
both generals and soldiers and inspired
them with confidence in his ability to

578
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:20,200
give them success of that ability.

579
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,380
He himself had never any doubt and in
his own self confidence lay much of his

580
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:32,191
power to inspire confidence in others
behind this dominating self confidence.

581
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:34,114
However,

582
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:39,210
les napoleons ability to see in any
military problem the few essential oils on

583
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:43,660
which success would depend.

584
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,400
He had the great power to simplify any
problem and to see what details were

585
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:54,850
important and which were unimportant.
There you go.

586
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,470
That's prioritize and execute. And it's
simple both in one big rule, right?

587
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,360
You got to know what's important.

588
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,270
You got to prioritize the importance
things and you've got to keep everything

589
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:09,070
simple. I got a, I got an
email from Sarah Armstrong.

590
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,810
Sure.
Talking about podcasts,

591
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,020
one 74 trying to be a five.
Oh.

592
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,410
[inaudible] trying to be a
five. Oh, in all categories.

593
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,430
And she basically emailed
me and said, hey, heads up.

594
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,990
I used to try and be a five Oh,
in every category.

595
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,060
Even in categories that didn't matter.
So that's,

596
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,040
you know, give heads up.
And I was like, well,

597
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,260
yeah, I mean I've talked
about, I've talked about that.

598
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,480
I talk about it with clients all the time,

599
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:43,630
but I talk about on the podcast
as well when they've specifically,

600
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,170
I talked about it saying,
I don't know if you remember this example.

601
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:49,630
I said a black belt in Jujitsu.

602
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,020
Like they don't care where you're grabbing
their sleeve and you're getting all

603
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:57,010
crazy. They don't care. That doesn't
matter if you're a white belt,

604
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:59,500
someone grabs your sleeves, you're
freaking out. I mean if you're,

605
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,280
if you're a black belt, like
okay, if you're a good leader
and there's some, some,

606
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:07,330
some issue that guys are complaining
about snow factor, you don't care.

607
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,810
And then there's some issues that come
up and you go, okay, that's important.

608
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:11,644
I need to address that.

609
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,030
So this is what he had the ability to
do is figure out what is essential and

610
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:20,260
what is not. Yeah. Yeah. And that's,
that can be kind of a tricky one.

611
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:23,560
Cause you know, some, some things
are super small, super small,

612
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,320
but at the end of the day that
might be kind of important. Yes.

613
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:29,290
You know like you can sort of predict,
you're like, hey, that's small. Sure.

614
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,730
For sure. Hey, I could see that continuing
and growing, you know, for sure.

615
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,510
And sometimes all you have to do is
monitor it to make sure it doesn't grow.

616
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,330
Yeah. Sometimes you have to
put it in check for sure.

617
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:43,810
Sometimes you have to destroy
something, remove it, Jill. It

618
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,430
sometimes you can't worry about
it because it's not important.

619
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,850
So you've got to figure which one
of those out. Like if your employee,

620
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,230
say you're a boss,
your employee comes in one minute late,

621
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,220
let's say comes in on time
every single time like,

622
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,720
but right out he cast to get there at
six you get there at six on the dot every

623
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,553
single day.

624
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,620
And then like one week on Monday comes
in at six oh one is that a big problem?

625
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,590
One day? No, it's not a problem. You,

626
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,740
you might want to throw
a little something right.

627
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,260
It's something little something.
It's not nothing. Yeah,

628
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,730
there's a little something.
That's what you know,

629
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:24,160
you might even want to say something
like along this I was private. I'd say

630
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,630
see what happens when you cut it so
close every day. You're already a little,

631
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,900
your missed it by a minute bro. Exactly
right. That's it. You just throw a little,

632
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,750
a little yeah, just let them
know you're watching. Yeah.

633
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,450
Just like how you said like some
things there. Kini but am I going get,

634
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,590
am I going to give a due to written
counseling cause there were women at late.

635
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,220
No.

636
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,500
Cause now the guy's looking for different
jobs and work cause he doesn't want to

637
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:46,390
work for you.
Spazz out on him.

638
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,950
But at the same time he's at
six oh one he's like cool.

639
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,340
So the next day he comes in at
six o'clock we'll say next day.

640
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,200
Then the next Monday comes in at six oh
two oh two no, it's just one more minute.

641
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,760
All right, got to put it in check.
Yes sir. You just a little something.

642
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,900
Same like some things they seem small
but you can take a broader view and be

643
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,540
like, hey this is kind of
important. Yeah. This is,

644
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:15,541
it goes back to the troop shaving in
the Soviet troops stopping shaving.

645
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:19,560
This is it. This is the slippery slope
of a lack of discipline slip. Yeah.

646
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,510
But I can tell you this,

647
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,200
if you're focused only
on these little things,

648
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:31,150
you might miss the big picture, which
was Sarah's point. Yes. And I responded,

649
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,580
I said Hey,
I totally agreed with her,

650
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:37,340
talked about some of the black
belt thing and then the boss thing.

651
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:39,890
And then I was like, and by the way,
cause this is something I've talked about,

652
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,560
the floor in my garage
gym is not to clean.

653
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,750
It does.
It gets a 2.0 on cleanliness.

654
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,410
Five out of five maybe even gets a one.

655
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,560
I think one may have maybe get
some [inaudible] not bad. However,

656
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:02,030
however it gets like a 1.5
because it's not, it's, it's not.

657
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:05,770
It doesn't have actual dirt on it.
It's just God speaking.

658
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,650
It's just got a chalk and sweat stains,

659
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,880
dried up utility button,

660
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:17,881
you and I said it would take 20 minutes
to a half an hour each day to keep that

661
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:23,840
thing at a 5.0 inspection ready level
because once you got to get in there and

662
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,480
space basically got a power wash, that
thing daily, that's where you're at.

663
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,740
So I'm not power washing that
thing daily. Why don't, why is it,

664
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,190
why is it not clean? Not
Important. Do I, I have,

665
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:37,850
I actually have a vacuum
in my garage that I

666
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,110
hit it with. Sometimes I hit
it every two, three days.

667
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,280
That's a lot different than breaking
out then. Then pulling the mats out,

668
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,170
power washing them in the alley,
and then bringing them back in.

669
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,160
That's a, that's not even half an hour.
That's like a, that's a serious evolution,

670
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,170
you know,
that's a serious evolution.

671
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,430
So is it worth being a 5.0 in
Matt cleanliness garage gym?

672
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,010
The answer is no. The answer
is no. It's not worth it.

673
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,290
You need to lower that
on the priority scale.

674
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:14,590
Now do I have big chunks of dirt
and dog hair piled up and debris?

675
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,200
No,
it's completely debris free,

676
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,110
but there are some sweat stains on it.
It has been there.

677
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:30,600
The remnants of getting after it. Right,
which is kind of conducive Kenzie way.

678
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,010
It is the way it is to the standard.
Then generally speaking,

679
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:38,240
not just an application to your garage,
gym floor to like everything.

680
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,530
It's like little things.

681
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:44,150
I mean just the basic little
little framework to establish
depends on the thing.

682
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,510
Yeah. So but what is it? So you can go,
let's say you go fundamentally then,

683
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:52,190
so what is it like if it, if it
gets in the way, even if this much,

684
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,700
this little millimeter gets in
the way of the overall objective,

685
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,700
then it's relevant. Important. Well, no.

686
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:01,070
Then we just have to frame
it so that we're not,

687
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,780
when we frame it as a waste of time,

688
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,490
like how much effort are you going
to put into that is no, if it's not,

689
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,750
if it doesn't get in the way, if
it, no, no. If it gets in the way,

690
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,190
then I'm putting too much time. If, if
it gets in the way of my strategic goal,

691
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,580
it's to bump into too much time into,
okay.

692
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,330
If solving this particular problem
to know it. Yes, yes. Okay. Okay.

693
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,400
But a amend the existing of a
small little problem. If it's,

694
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:29,980
if it's get gets in the way, so like gets
in the way, then it's a problem. Yeah.

695
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,793
Like I'm

696
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,090
like the guy coming in late. Right.
And let's see, all my garage floor,

697
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,360
there was chunks of rocks underneath
the mats and they made it uneven.

698
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,560
Yeah.

699
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,560
And it was like slightly hazardous for
me to be moving around on it and it

700
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,580
interrupted and my weight's rolled
around. That'd be a problem. Yes.

701
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,450
It's effecting my strategic goal.
Yes. Those mats are getting picked up.

702
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:00,060
The rocks are getting moved. The floors
getting leveled in. Then we're good to go.

703
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,740
Yeah.
On the,

704
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:06,830
on this levelness my maths
get a five o perfectly flat.

705
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,950
They're good to go there.
Do not interfere at all,

706
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:16,020
but they got some getting after it.
Stains on them. Yep. There it is.

707
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,250
Okay.
Going back to the book,

708
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:24,960
having grasp the essentials of the problem
and having inspired his soldiers with

709
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:29,820
confidence in himself and with high
morale. He knew he could not fail.

710
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,280
Napoleon, however, was always as
much a politician as a soldier.

711
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,080
He had a great love of intriguing,

712
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,130
of diplomatic bargaining and his contempt
for his fellow men and his passion to

713
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:47,310
dominate them and events led
him to aspire to greater things.

714
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:53,510
From the time he became first council
political rather than military factors

715
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,990
influenced his decisions and his failure
to reconcile his political aspirations

716
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,640
with what was militarily possible.

717
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,700
Finally led him to the disasters of
Moscow and the peninsula from which no

718
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:11,430
recovery was possible.

719
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,210
He started playing that political game,

720
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,470
started making his military decisions
based on what he wanted to happen

721
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,640
politically. Now, what did these
three men, Moses, Cromwell,

722
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,700
and Napoleon have in common without which
they would have not achieved success?

723
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:33,240
The most outstanding similarity was
that they dominated their fellow men.

724
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:39,830
They were all supremely confident that
they could and would do what they set out

725
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,810
to do. It was quite simple
to them, quite easy,

726
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,670
and success was absolutely certain.

727
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,620
This certainty gave them each the power
to inspire others to follow blindly and

728
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:57,060
to the limit of their strength and this
inspiration and power to enthuse others

729
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:02,290
in measurably increase the power of their
forces to achieve whatever was asked

730
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:06,150
to them. That's called the confidence
right there and that's what that is.

731
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,770
Pure confidence,
isn't it?

732
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,370
Isn't it interesting when you see
someone that's ultra confident and no,

733
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,030
they're not even overflowing into ego,
but they're just really,

734
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:17,430
really confident and,

735
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:23,520
and Pete people fall, people will, will
be like, okay, I'm on board this, this,

736
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:27,030
this person's in the game. They believe
it. I'm Balombo. I believe it too.

737
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:29,423
You know,

738
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,970
I've seen situations where people are
so confident that people are following

739
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:36,120
them even though they're
wrong. Hmm. You know, you get,

740
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,530
you would get that occasionally with a,
with a seal platoon,

741
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,340
you get some experience guy that was super
confident and he will actually wasn't

742
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:46,840
that good or didn't really understand
tactics too well and need to knows what

743
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:50,500
we're doing. Yeah. You know,
so I've done this a million
times. It's all, by the way,

744
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,990
that's a red flag when somebody,

745
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:57,400
when somebody counts on their number of
times or their experience that the way

746
00:47:57,401 --> 00:47:59,800
we've always done it, I've done this
a million times. That's a red flag.

747
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,040
The reason that they're using those
statements is because they don't have an

748
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:06,640
actual answer. So one of the
new guys says, Hey, hey boss.

749
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,220
I'm not really sure why we, why
are we assaulting, you know,

750
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:12,730
through the target from this area over
here. Wouldn't it make more sense to do?

751
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,640
And he goes, Oh look, I've done this
a million times zero, we're doing it.

752
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,040
He just thinks your cell phone so
you don't have an actual answer.

753
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,110
You don't have an answer as to why.
You're just,

754
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,140
you're just throwing that out there
as the easiest thing for you to do.

755
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,850
So if you ever find yourself saying,
because this is how we've always done it,

756
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,370
or look,
I've been doing this for 28 years,

757
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,370
you don't have a good answer.

758
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,080
You're all that could work against
you to be honest with you. Hey,

759
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,650
I've been doing this for 28 years and
then like that day and the person figures

760
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:43,660
out like a way better way to
do it. He'd be like, Dang Bro,

761
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:47,710
you've been wasting your
time for 28 years. Yeah,

762
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,000
it could definitely work out bad.

763
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:50,890
It could work out bad because
you're not listening to anyone else.

764
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,410
You're not taking input.
And then you end up making a bad decision

765
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:01,350
from what did these men get their supreme
confidence in their ability to achieve

766
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:02,770
their purpose in battle.

767
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,330
I think they got it from their ability to
see their problem in its simplest form.

768
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,220
Amen.
I totally agree with that.

769
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:13,600
To see the few essential is necessary to
the successful solution to the problem,

770
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:16,840
and to see how those few
essentials could be achieved.

771
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,330
This is why I'm always talking
about qualities of leadership.

772
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,810
The ability to simplify. I'm sure you've
heard me say this a thousand times.

773
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,690
If you have the ability
to simplify things,

774
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:32,410
that's a great asset to have and not
everyone has it or not everyone has the

775
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:35,110
same level of it. Some people are
good at it, some people not so much.

776
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,720
Some people just straight up
complicate things. Oh yeah.

777
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,510
Once they grasp the
essentials of the problem,

778
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:48,511
they never lost sight of them and never
allowed a massive detail to submerge

779
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,990
what was essential to success.
Boom.

780
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,290
Don't get caught up in the little details
of things that don't let those things

781
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,330
drown out what the real situation is

782
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:04,150
for all military problems
are in essence simple.

783
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,920
But the ability to simplify and to
select out of the massive detail,

784
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:13,870
those things and only those things that
are important is not always so easy.

785
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,890
So got to keep things simple.

786
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,870
Each of these men had the
power to dominate other men
spirits to inspire their

787
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:27,871
enthusiasm and to convince them of their
own ability to achieve what was asked

788
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:31,960
of them.
This moving of men spirits,

789
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:36,961
this power to enthuse could only be
done and was only done by their personal

790
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,010
contact with their men.

791
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,570
All my three examples weren't close
and frequent contact with their troops.

792
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,950
They were well known,

793
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,040
familiarly known to them and took
frequent opportunities of talking to their

794
00:50:51,071 --> 00:50:53,340
men. So again, this is
where that the thing I,

795
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,210
I spoke of earlier where
it's like he kinda,

796
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:58,690
he kinda comes back on a,

797
00:50:58,691 --> 00:51:00,460
you got to be this dominating
person that he's talking about.

798
00:51:00,461 --> 00:51:01,660
You got to get out there
and talk to your troops.

799
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,850
You gotta be really truly
personally known to them.

800
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:07,960
Napoleon and Kronwall certainly
in very possibly Moses too,

801
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:12,850
were known to their men by nicknames
and use this familiarity to help their

802
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:16,810
purpose. At the same time, each
of these leaders knew, well,

803
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:19,630
what the soldier was thinking
and what he wanted most.

804
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,070
And they made always careful
study of the human factor.

805
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,300
Now it's interesting because,

806
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,833
okay,

807
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,680
no Monte, he's known as Monte.
Everybody called him Monte. Yeah.

808
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,990
And that's his nickname. Yeah. And that
little breeds a little familiarity. Yeah.

809
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,680
And like I stole naming a unit,

810
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,540
renaming a unit when you took it over.
I stole that from David Hackworth. Yeah.

811
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:48,590
I wonder if Krom I wonder if Monty stall
this nickname idea and kind of gave

812
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:53,760
himself that nickname. Right?
Hackworth took it from Monte. Well,

813
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,970
no Hackworth. Well actually
I guess Hackworth, everyone
just called hack, hack. Hey,

814
00:51:56,971 --> 00:52:00,360
everyone called me Jocko. Yeah. Like
everyone, it's funny, someone said,

815
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,010
everyone in the chain of command,

816
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,910
the people below me in the chain of
command call me Jocko and the people above

817
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:08,010
me, the chain of command call me
Jack. Ever call me Jocko. Yeah.

818
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,190
So that was Kinda cool, but that was just
like coincidence. I don't even know why.

819
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,470
Yeah.
But

820
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:20,180
Hackworth, he didn't really, I don't
think Hackworth gave himself a nickname.

821
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,980
Yeah. And let's face it, the
Hackworth other than Hackworth and as,

822
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:28,610
as General Mooka Yama told us he
had the best nickname of all time,

823
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:33,440
Mr Infantry.
That is the coolest nickname ever.

824
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,480
He's hack considered a nickname if
it's short for your, I think it is.

825
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:43,340
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. There are certain names
that have an official shortening of it.

826
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,600
You know, like Richard and Rick
or you know Jonathan and John.

827
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:51,530
Robert and Bob. Bob. Yes, exactly. Bill
and William and bill on that. Okay,

828
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,340
so quit hack is not an official
unofficial, so it's sorta it,

829
00:52:55,341 --> 00:53:00,160
it goes into the realm of actual nickname,
not just shortening of the name. Yeah.

830
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,710
Yeah. But I think I, we
can research this all,

831
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,170
it's not coming to me
off the top of my head,

832
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:08,900
but I'm pretty sure everyone
called hack. Hack. Yeah.

833
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,870
Like up and down the chain of command.
Yeah.

834
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,850
Although his soldiers back in
the day probably called him, sir.

835
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:18,080
That's more normal for Vietnam. Dang.
How do you engineer it? Nickname no.

836
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:22,370
For Yourself. You can't do that. You
can't give your nickname to yourself. No.

837
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:25,980
But you can actually, there has to be a
way to sort of engineer the environment.

838
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,650
You could say, Hey, I'm hack.
How's it going? Yeah. But the
isn't that, I mean if the,

839
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:33,540
it would have to be established
before that. If you just start,

840
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:36,290
like if I just start saying,
Hey, I'm dragon. No worries. You,

841
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,020
if you checked into a military unit or
you and no one knew you and you're like,

842
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:44,910
Hey, what's up? Um, um, dragging
boy. Yeah, that would be
no, that wouldn't work. No,

843
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,350
but if you said, hey, my name is,
you know, frag mob or whatever,

844
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,920
if you just made up, you know your
nickname, all guys calling me that. Yeah.

845
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:56,840
I wouldn't, one time I hooked a grenade
and it rolled back and you know,

846
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,700
those places would have games.
Not true though. You know,

847
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:01,140
like doesn't mean problem.
If look,

848
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:04,830
if you hook the grenade in a thing and
someone called you fragment from then,

849
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,550
then on, then boom, someone gave you that
nickname, but you can hook a grenade.

850
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,990
It does whatever it is that it doesn't
be like I should be called. You know,

851
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,260
he can't really do that.
No nickname herself. No.

852
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:19,200
So even if you introduce yourself, if no
one knows you introduced yourself. Okay,

853
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:23,940
I'm dragging boy, but I just gave
that name to myself today and, but,

854
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:28,530
and they sure they'll call you dragging
boy. But if one person finds out, oh,

855
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,310
you just gave yourself, then they're going
to get your different nurse. Oh yeah.

856
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,790
Oh, you're somebody else. Yes sir. Real.
So how do you do it though? You don't.

857
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,700
You just gotta let it.
That's what I think is important.

858
00:54:38,701 --> 00:54:41,700
What's important here is that
the familiarity isn't a lie.

859
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:45,450
The familiarity is real. Yes. That's
the difference. You know how you do it.

860
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,680
It's not just, it's not 100% you,
it's more allowing nicknames to BC.

861
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,720
You know how like you know some people,
their name,

862
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,430
I don't know for just for
example, hypothetical example,
like let's say it's like,

863
00:54:56,431 --> 00:55:01,170
Hey, my name is Jonathan,
and then you know,

864
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:04,110
in a casual conversation with, Hey John,
what's up done. And then there'll be like,

865
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:06,840
hey, it's like no disrespect
or nothing, but it's Jonathan.

866
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,550
Like they preferred the whole thing maybe
to pull John's more of an official one.

867
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:15,150
But like if Hackworth would've said,
hey, it's, it's Hackworth not hack,

868
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,180
then he probably wouldn't have
had the name hack. That's true.

869
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,590
So when someone busts out a nickname for
you, you just got to let it fly. Well,

870
00:55:22,591 --> 00:55:24,650
I'll tell you in the teams when
they bust out a nickname for you,

871
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:27,060
if you protested, it's going
to stick even. There you go.

872
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:33,030
So you could essentially in theory,
fake protests. Exactly right.

873
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,430
They'd see right through that
call that fine

874
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,860
Jag ass, you've got to be quick. You've
got to be sneaky with it, I guess.

875
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,720
All right. Okay. Back to the book. If
a leader neglects the human factor,

876
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,220
he will fail.

877
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,480
No Man can lead others if he does not
know what they are thinking and feeling.

878
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,890
So again,

879
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:05,430
we got Monty here who kind of talks
like he's all aloof and everything,

880
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:09,000
but he knows you got to know your people
and you've got to understand people.

881
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,320
And then he goes on a little shift
here. No leader, however great can, can,

882
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,030
can long continue unless he wins.

883
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,510
Victories without victories in battle,

884
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,540
all else is useless to what
then is success in battle

885
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,850
do is great.
Study of Marlboro.

886
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,270
Mr Winston Churchill says,
very truly,

887
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:34,210
and so here's a little quote from Winston
Churchill, and this is interesting.

888
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,040
He's talking about the Duke
of Marlborough who was, uh,

889
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:43,380
another guy in the 16 hundreds that
fought in the war of Spanish succession.

890
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,970
This guy never lost a battle
apparently. And, and interesting,

891
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,320
he was the Duke of Marlborough,
but his actual name was John Churchill.

892
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,350
And he is actually, I want
to say the great, great,

893
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,620
maybe great grandfather
of Winston Churchill.

894
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:02,140
So this is Winston Churchill's bloodline.
Sure.

895
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,590
And this is what Winston Churchill
says about his great, great,

896
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,590
however many great grandfathers.
And I think that's right.

897
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:15,390
The success of a commander does not
arise from following rules or models.

898
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,490
It doesn't come from
following rules or models.

899
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:23,850
It consist in an absolutely new
comprehension of the dominant facts of the

900
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,580
situation at a time and
all the forces at work,

901
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,480
every great operation of war is unique.

902
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,610
What is wanted is a profound
appreciation of the actual event.

903
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,720
There is no sure road to
disaster then to imitate,

904
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:45,750
imitate the plans of bygone heroes
and to fit them to novel situations.

905
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,110
So there you go.

906
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,280
This ability to co two
absolutely comprehend this
new situation and to not try

907
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:56,260
and force,

908
00:57:56,261 --> 00:58:01,261
not try and force a rule or a model to
to work for you in a certain situation.

909
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,210
Back to the book.

910
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:10,210
This indeed is true
for no war foreign war.

911
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,690
No two situations are ever the same
and each situation must be tackled as a

912
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:19,610
wholly new problem to which there
will likely be a wholly new answer.

913
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:25,360
You need only to look at the beginning
of this war and to and to the trust put

914
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:28,250
in ImageNow line here in deed.

915
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:33,290
Was there a failure to appreciate the
new and change technique which had risen

916
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:38,240
and one which rendered such fortifications
in themselves wholly useless

917
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,030
to win victories.

918
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:46,090
Certain qualities are necessary and I
will mention for which were possessed in

919
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:50,270
greater or less by all the
great captains of history.

920
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,590
These are the knowledge of
the technique of making war.

921
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,350
So that's interesting because
Churchill just said, look,

922
00:58:57,351 --> 00:59:00,440
it's not using this previous knowledge.
You gotta be able to apply it.

923
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,180
But at the same time,
guess what?

924
00:59:02,181 --> 00:59:07,100
You got to have the knowledge
of the technique of making
war next to the ability

925
00:59:07,101 --> 00:59:10,700
to see clearly the few essentials
that are important to success. Next,

926
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:14,090
courage and mental robustness.
And lastly,

927
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,610
a well balanced judgment.

928
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:19,883
Okay.

929
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,460
He kind of goes through these
in a bit more detail now.

930
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:27,260
The manner in which war is
waged varies from age to age.

931
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,700
And with the advent of each new weapon,
it is a constantly changing,

932
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,290
constantly evolving thing.

933
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,160
He who aspires to high command in war
must thoroughly understand the main

934
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:41,030
principles which will dictate the manner
in which the battle of the of his age

935
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:41,900
will be fought.

936
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,130
He also must be constantly on the
watch for new ideas or weapons,

937
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:47,960
which will affect those principles.

938
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,710
The speed of change in military
science during time of pieces,

939
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:56,420
often slow and many of consequently
allowed themselves to be lulled into false

940
00:59:56,421 --> 01:00:01,280
sense of security, which has been
rudely shattered on the outbreak of war.

941
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:06,770
So guess what? You got to have an open
mind and you got to pay attention.

942
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:12,910
The knowledge of how to make war also
implies the ability to train troops.

943
01:00:12,911 --> 01:00:17,680
Every great commander has himself had to
forge his weapon for the task in front

944
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:21,960
of him. Moses led the people of
Israel for 40 years in the desert,

945
01:00:21,961 --> 01:00:26,070
teaching them how to fight and he
forged the weapon to conquer Canaan.

946
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,500
So also chrom,
well and Napoleon,

947
01:00:28,501 --> 01:00:32,130
they forged their own weapon
for this specific task in hand,

948
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:37,420
improvising and inventing as they went
along so as to develop new tactics to

949
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:42,780
deal with the new problems with
which in their day they were faced.

950
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:50,020
So you've got to study war, you've got
to understand how to train your troops.

951
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,930
Continuing on.

952
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:57,880
No Man can be a great military leader
unless he has the ability to cut through

953
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:02,800
overlying difficulties and to see clearly
the few essential in any problem which

954
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,130
with which he is faced in any problem.

955
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:11,220
There are never more than a few essentials
which are vital to that problem.

956
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,550
Yeah,

957
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:15,250
that's a pretty bold statement
and it's also pretty true. Yeah.

958
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,800
You get these big problems.
Guess what?

959
01:01:17,801 --> 01:01:19,930
There's only a few things
that are truly essential. Now,

960
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:23,650
as you solve the first
couple essential ones,

961
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,200
there's going to be the next essential
problem. This is prioritize and execute.

962
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,110
Yeah, and it's kind of
simple to read. Simple. Yes,

963
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:31,510
like they're both wrapped
together in this thought.

964
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:37,470
These must be grasp out of the massive
details and must never be lost sight of.

965
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:42,610
If in battle commander loses sight
of the few essentials that matter,

966
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:44,110
he will suffer defeat.

967
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,620
So when you're getting
distracted by these other things,

968
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:51,790
you're going to end up losing.
But to see the essentials,

969
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:56,170
clearly he must not himself
get too immersed in detail.

970
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:00,190
Every great commanders had a chief of
staff who's main task with the mastery of

971
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,024
detail,

972
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:04,960
thus leaving his master free to tackle
essentials of the problem together with

973
01:02:04,961 --> 01:02:08,890
those details and only though
those details which were
vital, that problem, boom,

974
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:14,320
that's it. You cannot get in the
weeds. You cannot micromanage.

975
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,890
You cannot look at a plan all day and
expect that you're gonna see something

976
01:02:17,891 --> 01:02:20,340
that your troops didn't see who are doing
the planning. You need to step back.

977
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:21,900
You need to elevate yourself

978
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,150
for though they're as much detail in
which the for though is there is much

979
01:02:28,151 --> 01:02:31,630
detail with which a commander cannot
and must not bothered himself,

980
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:36,130
is interesting to note that every great
commander has always concerned himself

981
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:39,220
with certain of the
details of his problems.

982
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:43,800
Napoleon and Wellington are
two good cases in point.

983
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:49,160
No Man can rise to a high command
who is not the quality of courage.

984
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,280
The highest form of personal courage
is required rather in the leader at the

985
01:02:56,191 --> 01:03:00,990
lower level who has to plunge into
the turmoil of the battlefield.

986
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,540
So yeah, if you're in the frontline
troops, you need even more courage.

987
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:07,860
The leader at the higher levels has to
develop his quality of courage into a

988
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:09,180
mental robustness,

989
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:14,181
which can withstand the mental stress and
strain with which he will be assailed.

990
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,670
Okay?

991
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:18,140
He must at all times.

992
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:24,460
He must be able at all times to take a
dispassionate view of the good and bad

993
01:03:24,531 --> 01:03:28,620
fortune, which will a sale him. Ah,

994
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,080
read that one again.

995
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,040
He must be able at all times to take a
dispassionate view of the good and bad

996
01:03:37,011 --> 01:03:41,030
fortune, which will a sale. So a
get bad things are gonna happen.

997
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:41,990
Good things are gonna happen.

998
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:46,480
Don't get all excited when some you get
all excited, you gotta be dispassionate.

999
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:50,060
You got to detach. You can't let
your emotions start getting crazy.

1000
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,620
You have to detach.

1001
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:57,350
He must not allow himself to be distracted
by events or to be led astray from

1002
01:03:57,351 --> 01:04:00,500
his main purpose.
By some glittering prize.

1003
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:06,800
He must at all times maintain an unbiased
view of the situation and in battle,

1004
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:11,720
he must be able to judge the true value
of the mass of good and bad tidings,

1005
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:12,890
which will flow upon him.

1006
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,410
Okay,

1007
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:18,110
man. Stayed attached. Stay levelheaded,

1008
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,060
go too bad. Does that kind of like
one, like, you know how you get the,

1009
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,460
the husband or the boyfriend or
whatever that like, you know,

1010
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,010
he does something bad.
I Dunno.

1011
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,300
Flirts with a girl or something like
that girl, that girlfriends all mad.

1012
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,320
And then so the guy goes and
bias or like, oh, necklace,

1013
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,690
you know to say sorry. It's
Kinda like that, right.

1014
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:41,830
Where don't get all caught up in
the glittery stuff because you know,

1015
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:47,110
no, that's not what this is like.

1016
01:04:47,111 --> 01:04:52,060
This echoes saving up to buy a
house. Yeah. In any saving up.

1017
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:55,120
And he's like, okay, I saved,
you know, 800 bucks last month.

1018
01:04:55,121 --> 01:04:57,970
I'm a save 1200 bucks this month.
I'm gonna save 900 bucks this month.

1019
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:02,310
And all of a sudden you see a,
a new car with rims in,

1020
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:07,240
in with has rim and you can
get it, you can lease it.

1021
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:11,560
Uh, yeah. And all you need
to lease it is, you know,

1022
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:15,010
$4,000 and you're like,
you know what,

1023
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,010
I'm going to go get data as the shiny

1024
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,680
new thing. They just took you
off of your main goal. Yes.

1025
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:24,070
That has nothing to do with flirting.
Girlfriend buy a necklace as

1026
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:28,380
well. I think yours is a
better example. For sure.

1027
01:05:28,381 --> 01:05:32,800
I big so here's wasn't even an example
if you missed the point. Okay. Yeah.

1028
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,310
Uh, I'm trying to think of where
it would be. Oh yeah. I mean,

1029
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:40,290
so if we're going to talk like a girl
that was saving for a house. Yeah.

1030
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:43,450
And then she's all cool
necklace, that would have been
a good example. Yeah. Look,

1031
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,770
the flirting girl with the distraction
from the boyfriend. No, that's, that's,

1032
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,830
here's how I would try to connect the
dots on that one. But you know, the girl,

1033
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,360
her mission is to evaluate whether or not
this is the good boyfriend straight up

1034
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,830
and then saw the boyfriend.

1035
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:00,850
He does some stuff that's fundamentally
bad cheats on her, I dunno, whatever.

1036
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,880
And then, you know, so she's
sort of on that mission.

1037
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,740
She's sort of making the evaluation.
Then boom,

1038
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:09,250
she gets distracted by the
sparkly necklace. Boom. She
goes back to them, blah,

1039
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:13,720
blah, blah. See what I'm saying? It's
still, oh no, not quite. Not Quite.

1040
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,810
I mean, I good, good effort, good effort.

1041
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:19,653
Moving on.

1042
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:25,120
Every battle resolves itself into a tussle
between the wills of the two opposing

1043
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,930
commanders.
Unless he's mentally Robusto,

1044
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,360
commander will not be able to
force his will on his opponent.

1045
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,700
It is well for a commander to remember
that no battle was ever lost until the

1046
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,320
commander thought it's so

1047
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,433
hmm.

1048
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,270
No battle is ever lost until
the commander fought it. So

1049
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:50,170
a commander must have a
well balanced judgment.

1050
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,760
They're too little balance
of the dichotomies here,

1051
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:57,290
both from the battle situation and in
his dealings with his subordinates.

1052
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:01,100
This is straight up dichotomy of
leadership. He must be okay now.

1053
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:06,110
He must see the battle situation as
constantly shifting interplay of forces,

1054
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:11,510
and he must instinctively know when to
be rash and when to be cautious. Boom.

1055
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,920
Gotta be balanced.

1056
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:18,460
He must weigh up the situation both at
the moment and as it may develop in the

1057
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:20,000
future.

1058
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And he must so fight his battle that
the enemy's reactions cannot upset his

1059
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,970
plan. And Novo, he's trying to
force his will on his opponent.

1060
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
A commander must know when discretion
is the better part of valor.

1061
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:39,700
His desire to dominate his opponent must
not outweigh his judgment of the actual

1062
01:07:40,221 --> 01:07:44,030
possibilities of the situation.
Yes,

1063
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:46,670
you got to be aggressive,
but you can't be foolhardy.

1064
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:49,250
That's what we're saying here.
This is the dichotomy of leadership.

1065
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,150
His judgment and must always be
well balanced and if it is so,

1066
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:56,030
and if he has good information
on which to base it,

1067
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,070
he can so forced the battle his way,
that the enemy will be forced to conform.

1068
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:07,210
He will in fact have rested the initiative
from the enemy in his dealings with

1069
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:09,741
his subordinates.

1070
01:08:09,741 --> 01:08:14,210
He will also require good jet judgment
and sound knowledge of human nature.

1071
01:08:14,211 --> 01:08:19,100
He must choose subordinates well those
with whom he is infrequent contact,

1072
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:21,740
his senior generals must know personally.

1073
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,200
He must know personally and well.

1074
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:27,860
He must be able to judge when
to drive and when to persuade,

1075
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,880
when to be stern and when to give praise
for all men are different and each

1076
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:36,620
requires handling it a different way.

1077
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:38,660
So right there he just talked
about the dichotomy. Leadership,

1078
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:43,340
right when to drive and winter persuade
when to be stern when it be give praise

1079
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:48,170
God a balance. Those dichotomies. The
three leaders whom I have concerned,

1080
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,170
considered succeeded so long
as they kept in their mind.

1081
01:08:51,171 --> 01:08:54,530
They're clear military purpose and
we're not deflected from it by any other

1082
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:55,490
considerations,

1083
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:59,090
but there is always the danger
that other and especially political

1084
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:00,740
considerations will be forced,

1085
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:04,190
will force the hand of the soldier
and leading to some action,

1086
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:06,170
which is militarily unwise.

1087
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:11,000
Many battles have been fought for
political and not for military reasons,

1088
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:16,190
and these have been the graveyard
of many a soldier's reputation.

1089
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:22,390
The soldier is the servant
of the statesmen and is
therefore bound to be subject

1090
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:23,900
to political pressure.

1091
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:29,020
He must be strong enough to resist such
pressure whenever it conflicts with his

1092
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,330
clear military purpose.

1093
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,920
Few statesmen will force
the hand of the soldier.

1094
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:41,450
If the soldier very bluntly says, okay,
five, fight as you wish me to fight,

1095
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:46,220
I shall lose the battle. If I fight
in my own way and in my own time,

1096
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:50,510
I shall win the battle. So there
you go. That's what you gotta do.

1097
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:55,250
You gotta call it like you see it,
but the soldier,

1098
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:59,180
it must be prepared to be very blunt and
he must be prepared to stake his whole

1099
01:09:59,181 --> 01:10:03,350
reputation on successive given
adequate resources and a free hand.

1100
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:08,420
And he also must be prepared to be very
firm and to refuse to be forced to do

1101
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:12,320
something which he considers
is not capable of being done.

1102
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,070
So there you have it.
If you don't think something can be done,

1103
01:10:16,071 --> 01:10:17,960
it's your moral obligation to say no.

1104
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,580
And of course you have to weigh that
with the fact that if you don't do it,

1105
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,850
someone mouth's might and they
might cause even more damage.

1106
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:30,680
So you have to weigh that.
That conundrum

1107
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,430
back to the book in history,

1108
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:39,090
the military leader is frequently been
tempted and as frequently succumb to the

1109
01:10:39,091 --> 01:10:41,700
temptation to aspire to
political leadership.

1110
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,320
The whole training and experience of the
soldier makes him less rather than more

1111
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:52,020
fitted to be a politician. So this
is, this is an interesting contrast.

1112
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:57,690
The soldier is trained to take direct
action down certain well defined blinds

1113
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,310
and as in his hand,

1114
01:10:59,311 --> 01:11:04,050
a military machine which
responds immediately and
with precision to his touch.

1115
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:07,290
The politician is trained in subtlety,
in debate,

1116
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,160
in weighing up the conflicting interests
of his supporters and usually has to

1117
01:11:11,161 --> 01:11:15,540
compromise the governmental machine
much less precise and exact than the

1118
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:20,541
military and is not as rapid an action
even in highly skilled political hands.

1119
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:22,960
Okay.

1120
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,820
Now in worf commander compromises
on essentials he fails.

1121
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:29,623
Furthermore,

1122
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:33,980
the time factor forces the commander in
the field to adopt the best expedient in

1123
01:11:33,981 --> 01:11:36,830
the time available,
which is usually short.

1124
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:40,760
The politician on the other hand is seldom
forced to give an immediate decision.

1125
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:45,290
Rather he delays in order to find out
the right to an accurate answer and he

1126
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:50,291
avoids any temporary expedient one seizes
time by the forelock and adopts the

1127
01:11:53,061 --> 01:11:54,590
best expedient,

1128
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:59,770
the other procrastinates in order to
ensure that what he does is exactly right.

1129
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:01,280
Now I think you could.

1130
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:05,360
I think this gets taken to the extreme
in both cases cause you actually,

1131
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:08,760
even as a military leader, you want to
weigh in, make sure you're, you want to,

1132
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:12,350
you want to wait long enough to make
sure you're making a good decision.

1133
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:16,730
And I think in the political world they
go to the extreme of they're just going

1134
01:12:16,731 --> 01:12:18,710
to never make a decision,
never going to make a change.

1135
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:24,680
Therefore, leader who is primarily a
soldier, when he metals with politics,

1136
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:29,480
it loses his clear and simple military
purpose. He no longer sees the essentials.

1137
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,820
He is at sea in a political world.

1138
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:37,120
We read that chrom well in politics was
muddled and perplexed working slowly in

1139
01:12:37,131 --> 01:12:40,490
deviously to a policy which
he did not clearly see

1140
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,220
and again that he was
confused and distracted.

1141
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,150
So though he kept the political power
and his own hands during his lifetime,

1142
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:53,530
much of what he built fell to pieces.
The moment he died. So Awesome Napoleon,

1143
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,030
as long as his military purpose was upper,
most in his mind he succeeded.

1144
01:12:58,031 --> 01:13:01,420
But when had political
considerations dominated as policy,

1145
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,680
the desire to impose his will on Europe
led him to undertake military operations,

1146
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,890
which it was beyond his power to achieve

1147
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:15,680
the qualities required by a soldier and
by a politician are in fact almost at

1148
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,580
opposite poles and only a few men in
history of possessed both kinds of

1149
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:21,414
qualities.

1150
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:25,590
There have not been many soldiers who
have made good politik politicians nor

1151
01:13:25,591 --> 01:13:29,910
many politicians who have
made great soldiers. Now,

1152
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:34,440
the only thing I'll say is that being
in the military is very political and

1153
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:38,010
you've even in this time I, I'm not
gonna make any distinction that, oh,

1154
01:13:38,011 --> 01:13:39,300
it's more political now.

1155
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:43,980
It's not the old moon may old books about
World War II was all kinds of politics,

1156
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:47,200
politics, politics going on inside
the chain of command. So Adam,

1157
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:51,240
I'm not sure why he,
I'm not sure why he,

1158
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:56,250
he sees that great distinction
between, you know, there being no,

1159
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,320
like there's no political things,

1160
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:03,210
no political games being played in
the military. There certainly is.

1161
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:07,200
Certainly is. And there always has
been. And there always will be.

1162
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:09,390
It's a group of people and then group
people are going to do the little

1163
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:12,260
political maneuvers. I, we'll
look out for themselves.

1164
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:14,250
They're going to try and make
this happen. You know, that's,

1165
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:15,910
that's they're going to have an agenda.

1166
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,740
You got to learn how to
negotiate those politics,

1167
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:23,050
whether you're in the military and
whether you're in the civilian sector.

1168
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:27,880
It doesn't matter before we
leave the past. It is I think,

1169
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:32,380
interesting to note that great military
leaders have on the whole been few.

1170
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,800
Yeah,

1171
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,210
there've been many generals of good
average ability but few who were really

1172
01:14:38,211 --> 01:14:43,070
great in the study of those who are great.
It is interesting to note two things.

1173
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:46,340
First, a required a war
to produce them. Second,

1174
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:50,990
that a number of them prove
their greatness after a
very short apprenticeship.

1175
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:54,530
This suggests that the art of war,

1176
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:59,620
at any rate in the past though less so
now is a relatively simple art and that

1177
01:15:01,551 --> 01:15:04,160
the qualities which
make a great commander,

1178
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:09,220
our inherent rather than
acquired, interesting. He's a
little bit more saying, hey,

1179
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:10,550
you kind of born with it.

1180
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:14,930
The character and more especially
the will to dominate and lead.

1181
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:19,190
His fellow man is given to few,
but given that power to lead,

1182
01:15:19,191 --> 01:15:24,191
the ability to gain success in war can
be acquired so you can get better at it.

1183
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:30,700
A man may cultivate the qualities of
a great leader provided that he has

1184
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:35,350
inherited him in sufficient degree,
the character and the will to dominate.

1185
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:40,100
But unless he has those
inherent characteristics,

1186
01:15:40,101 --> 01:15:41,560
he will never become a great leader.

1187
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:45,190
However long he studies the
art or the craft of war.

1188
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,593
Okay.

1189
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,480
Here's one of the phenomena of military
history that events in variably produce

1190
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,510
the man age has little
or nothing to do with it.

1191
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:57,180
The opportunity may come
sooner to som later to others.

1192
01:15:57,330 --> 01:16:00,060
Napoleon was 27 when he
conquered northern Italy.

1193
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,720
Wolf was 34 when he captured
a Quebec at the younger end.

1194
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:07,710
At the other end of the
scale of Marlborough was 52
when he first rose to high

1195
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,210
and independent command,

1196
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:13,950
an Abercrombie conducted as short but
brilliant campaign in Egypt at the age of

1197
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:18,951
68 at the end of a long lifetime
in the careers of great generals.

1198
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,350
There's always been this aspect of chance.

1199
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:25,590
Opportunity comes at different ages
and in different circumstances.

1200
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,300
Some have been luckier than others.

1201
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:30,810
Some perhaps never had the
opportunity to prove their ability.

1202
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:33,730
Yeah,

1203
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:37,060
so that's where he wraps up so much
for the lessons of history today.

1204
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:40,960
The problems of military leadership are
much the same as they always have been.

1205
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:46,090
I proposed to tell you now some of the
things that have guided me in leading

1206
01:16:46,091 --> 01:16:48,790
armies,
which had been entrusted to my command,

1207
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:54,180
I would say first that a leader must
very clearly know what he wants himself.

1208
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,010
He must see his objective clearly
and must go all out for it.

1209
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:01,650
Okay?

1210
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:06,650
He must let everyone else know what he
wants and what are the basic fundamentals

1211
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,060
of his policy.

1212
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,520
He must in fact give from
guidance and a clear lead.

1213
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:17,930
It will be necessary for him to create
what I call atmosphere and in that

1214
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:21,620
atmosphere, his subordinate commanders
and troops will live and work to do this.

1215
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:25,640
He will have to take a very firm grip
on his military machine from the top.

1216
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:29,420
Only in this way will his force
acquire balance and cohesion.

1217
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:32,090
And so develop its full fighting.

1218
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:37,091
Potential history has many examples of a
lack of grip being taken by a commander

1219
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,160
with the result that he failed to develop.

1220
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:45,070
The power of which is forced with Cape
was capable and so met disasters we've

1221
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,890
done. This is Monte. You
got to take that from grip

1222
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:54,080
and again it's very strange because
he comes off so strong like that,

1223
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:56,990
but here we go.
He's going to counter it right here.

1224
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,880
Having laid down the basic fundamentals
of his policy, a commander must complete,

1225
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:06,500
must place complete trust in his
subordinates and less give them freedom to

1226
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:11,501
carry out that policy within the
framework which he is laid down.

1227
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,550
So this is decentralized command.

1228
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:19,370
He must be prepared to decentralize and
to trust his subordinates to use their

1229
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,810
own initiative on all matters of detail.
Everyone listen to that.

1230
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:26,680
Don't worry about the details.

1231
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:30,430
The commander of selfless stand back
from the detail so we can see clearly the

1232
01:18:30,431 --> 01:18:34,390
essentials of his problem and make sure
that the correct action is being taken

1233
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,530
on those essentials.

1234
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:39,700
If ever a commander allows himself
to become too greatly immersed in the

1235
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,140
unimportant details of any problem,

1236
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:45,580
he will fail to see the
essential clearly detached stake.

1237
01:18:45,581 --> 01:18:48,670
A step back,
elevate yourself.

1238
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:53,350
It is obvious that he must be a good
judge of men and a good chooser of

1239
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:57,160
subordinates. He must also have
the drive to get things done.

1240
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,170
No commander will long remain in the
first rank unless he achieves success.

1241
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,640
The biggest single factor for
making success in war is morale.

1242
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:13,330
High Morale is based on discipline,
self respect,

1243
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:17,260
and the confidence of the soldier
in his commanders and his weapons.

1244
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:22,380
It is a pearl, a very great
price, and without it,

1245
01:19:22,381 --> 01:19:24,930
no success in battle will be achieved.

1246
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:30,380
A high morale is in fact a measure
of the confidence of troops of their

1247
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:34,410
commander. That's an
interesting point, right?

1248
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,010
How do you have high morale?
It's a measurement of how
confident the troops are.

1249
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,900
Hmm. So when the, when,

1250
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,730
when the troops are confident or the or
the employees are confident in the boss,

1251
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,990
morale is high. When they're
not confident, morale is low.

1252
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:53,250
And by the way, with low
morale, you're not winning.

1253
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,600
Continuing on.

1254
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:02,070
There is no book of rules which will help
a commander to gain the complete trust

1255
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:03,180
and confidence of his men.

1256
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:09,200
Each commander will adopt his own
methods and say the ones best to his own

1257
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,690
personality.
Suffice it to say that he must be known,

1258
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,320
must be known personally to
them and that success in battle,

1259
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:19,290
we'll produce quick results.
All soldiers will follow.

1260
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:23,190
A successful general no commander,
however,

1261
01:20:23,191 --> 01:20:27,360
will gain the confidence of his troops
unless he is known and well known to them.

1262
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:32,850
They must often see him and if possible,
hear him speak.

1263
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,810
A commander should take every opportunity
of talking to his officers and men.

1264
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,690
It will repay him according to his worth.

1265
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:42,180
Got To get out there
and talk to the troops.

1266
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:49,200
There are other factors also, which have
a big effect on morale. The home front

1267
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:55,860
and the battle on the front
nowadays are as as never before,

1268
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,630
very closely linked. So you've
got to got to keep that morale up.

1269
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:02,320
You gotta make sure everything's
going good on the home front and see.

1270
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,790
Imagine what it's linked like now. I
mean, this is what he's talking about.

1271
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:08,610
World War Two, World War II. Hey,

1272
01:21:08,611 --> 01:21:11,490
we're very closely linked because I can
write a letter that's going to get to my

1273
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:13,050
wife nine weeks from now.

1274
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:18,330
Right now we got brothers
on Facebook live nightly,

1275
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:23,910
continue on just to success
as a great stimulus to morale,

1276
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:27,060
so nothing lowers morale.
So quickly is failure.

1277
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,940
Therefore there must be no failures.

1278
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:35,160
Great and lasting harm can be done to
morale by undertaking operations for which

1279
01:21:35,161 --> 01:21:40,161
the troops concerned are not ready or or
trained in which they are likely to end

1280
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:42,623
in failure.

1281
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:48,270
I have therefore made it a rule to limit
the scope of any operation to what can

1282
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:52,110
be achieved successfully.
So again,

1283
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:57,111
this sounds super risk averse and that's,

1284
01:21:57,331 --> 01:21:58,500
that's that is,
hey,

1285
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:01,530
I'm not going to do anything that I
don't know we can achieve it. Then again,

1286
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:06,120
how often do you want to be rolling the
dice? W W why not say, you know what?

1287
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,370
Well let's give it another month.
Let's train a little bit more.

1288
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,680
What do we have to do this right now?
You know,

1289
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:15,960
and I certainly think that there's times
when you have to take risk and you're

1290
01:22:15,961 --> 01:22:18,270
going to do some things that maybe you
don't know if you can get away with.

1291
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,880
And there can be times where you're
forced into that position as well.

1292
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:23,310
Like you're being attacked and hey,
we can,

1293
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,110
I'm not sure if a flank is going to work,

1294
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:28,470
but we can either sit here and get
attacked and get flanked by them.

1295
01:22:28,471 --> 01:22:31,710
Or we can go and flank ourselves like,
let's, let's go make this happen.

1296
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:35,190
So I think we need to make
sure we don't take that route,

1297
01:22:35,191 --> 01:22:39,450
that comment to the extreme
because that can be a bit much,

1298
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:43,470
but consider it,
consider it deeply.

1299
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,420
And I think probably the reason why this,

1300
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:50,550
this is probably one of
those points where, you know,

1301
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,090
he said in the beginning of this,
he made the premise that, um,

1302
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:59,580
that hey, this is, uh, this is,
this is for army command, right?

1303
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,040
Or at least divisional
command we're talking to,

1304
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:06,250
you're in charge of 10,000 people or so.

1305
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:11,050
What he's saying maybe, but I guess
it becomes more acceptable of a rule.

1306
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:15,790
You don't want to risk 10,000 you don't
want to risk an entire army or to entire

1307
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:19,060
division on something that you may
or may not be successful at, right?

1308
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:22,900
Maybe we need to reassess if we're
not sure we can make this happen.

1309
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:24,970
Maybe we need to reassess if
we're going to go forward or not.

1310
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,163
Hmm.

1311
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:34,250
Another thing that today has a big effect
on morale is the standard of medical

1312
01:23:34,321 --> 01:23:39,090
care which soldiers can expect.
So you got that

1313
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:47,270
and then we get to a commander must
make a very close study of human nature.

1314
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,530
The raw material with which
he has to deal are men,

1315
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,860
and it is important to remember
that all men are different.

1316
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:01,290
What a commander makes of the human
material at his disposal will depend

1317
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:05,610
entirely on himself.
I have found that every division,

1318
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:09,330
which has fought under my command,
has added different characteristics.

1319
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:12,180
Each division was good at
a different type of battle,

1320
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:16,170
and it is a vital that the commanders
should gauge what type of battle is best

1321
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:21,171
at and make sure that each division
is at the right point when required.

1322
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,673
Okay.

1323
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:29,380
So even in the quote,
uniformity of the military,

1324
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:32,800
the half differences,
they're human beings and those,

1325
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:35,830
those differences are
reflected through whole units.

1326
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,900
The difference between divisions is based
partly on the individual individuality

1327
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:44,920
of the commander of the division and
partly on the type of men of whom the

1328
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:47,050
division is composed.
I found for instance,

1329
01:24:47,051 --> 01:24:50,350
that some divisions were outstandingly
good at the breakthrough attack,

1330
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:53,140
but we're not so good at the
deliberate set piece affair.

1331
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:58,510
Some divisions we're best at night,
some by day four, a solid killing match.

1332
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:01,930
Certain types of men were
better than others and so on.

1333
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,740
Each division develops an
individuality of its own,

1334
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,230
which I consider a high commander

1335
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:10,423
must study.

1336
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:17,500
I was in the airport and I ran into a
dude from South Africa who is in the game

1337
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:25,880
kind of big time,
and he was talking about,

1338
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,150
he says, yes, I can't
do it on their accident,

1339
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:34,010
but he was saying that he had,
he worked construction,

1340
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:38,900
he was a construction guy and he had
a crew and he gave his crew a name.

1341
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:41,810
I should have asked him what the
name of the crew was, but I didn't.

1342
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:45,800
But I'm sure they gave him, he gave
him some kind of name and he was like,

1343
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:50,900
he was just so pumped. And he goes,
yeah, I read it in Hackworth too.

1344
01:25:50,901 --> 01:25:54,530
And then I, I did it cause
you did it. And he goes,

1345
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:57,590
it really worked mate.
It was all fired up.

1346
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:00,800
Could you can change the
personality of something.

1347
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:05,210
You can change the personality
of a unit like that can do it.

1348
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:06,283
It works.

1349
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:09,783
Okay.

1350
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,000
In the same way,

1351
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:16,430
all generals differ and must be selected
for the job in hand. No two jobs,

1352
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:17,720
no two problems are ever the same.

1353
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:21,020
And the character of the job must be
matched to that of the commander selected

1354
01:26:21,021 --> 01:26:21,854
to undertake it.

1355
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:26,090
One of the most important functions of a
commander in war does to make sure that

1356
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:29,150
he has the right man in the right
place to tackle the job in hand.

1357
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,140
So think about that.
When you're in charge of a team,

1358
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:34,430
when you're in charge of a business,

1359
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:38,360
one of the most important things that
you do is put the right people in the

1360
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:39,194
right job.

1361
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:48,050
Some people are sensitive to that,
you know? So when I'm like, Hey,

1362
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:51,530
hey bill, I'm not giving you this
op, I'm giving it to echo in.

1363
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:55,640
Bill gets mad and frustrated and he's the
things to echo doesn't deserve it. Man.

1364
01:26:55,641 --> 01:27:00,020
We got to have a good enough relationship
and trust that when I say, Hey, bill,

1365
01:27:00,021 --> 01:27:02,780
this ops not for you, I'm giving it
to echo. And he goes, okay, cool.

1366
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:05,060
Let me know what's coming down the pike.
Let me know what I can get ready for it.

1367
01:27:05,061 --> 01:27:06,110
Let me know how I can support.

1368
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:11,280
Yeah, yeah, that. Remember you remember
the movie Major League Charlie Sheen?

1369
01:27:11,281 --> 01:27:13,860
Come on. But yeah, I remember the movie.

1370
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:16,650
I don't think I ever sat through that
whole movie. Oh actually, you know what?

1371
01:27:16,651 --> 01:27:18,810
I think I asked you that before.
I think you said the same thing.

1372
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,790
So there's this part where case Charlie
Sheen, right? He got his glasses.

1373
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,910
He, Oh yeah, that's what we
were talking about last time.

1374
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,920
So last time as far as major league goes,
the movie major league.

1375
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:34,500
So Charlie Sheen, he had all this
crazy power and speed in his fastball,

1376
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,950
but no control, no control. Then they
find out whatever, he can't see that good.

1377
01:27:37,951 --> 01:27:40,410
They give him some glasses.
Boomi, he brings it all together.

1378
01:27:40,411 --> 01:27:41,790
They start waiting on this stuff,
right.

1379
01:27:41,791 --> 01:27:45,630
So He's starting the other guy who was
starting before him, his name's Harris,

1380
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:50,550
older guy, but you know the basically
the more concern, like he's consistent.

1381
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:53,370
He's not like legit like Charlie
Sheen, but he's consistent, you know.

1382
01:27:53,371 --> 01:27:55,170
So there are about to
play the fast forward,

1383
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:57,360
there are about to play the gang keys,
right.

1384
01:27:57,361 --> 01:28:00,820
And the big or the is that
called the world series?

1385
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:07,170
It's like this big deal. And you
know, so the general manager,

1386
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,980
Lou Calls Charlie Sheen,
what was his name in the movie?

1387
01:28:10,981 --> 01:28:12,980
Charlie Sheen doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter. Anyway,

1388
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:16,020
it calls Charlie Sheen to the back
of the bus and he's like, Hey,

1389
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:19,500
I'm going to start Harris
against the Yankees.

1390
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:22,650
He just has a better reputation
against them and you know, more,

1391
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:27,280
more experience or whatever. And then
Charlie Sheen was like, oh yeah, you know,

1392
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:31,440
whatever's best for the team.
And he left and that was sort of it.

1393
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:35,100
So he was good with it. Now the movie
goes on and he's not good with it.

1394
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:38,820
He expressed himself like he was good
with it and he said the right things,

1395
01:28:38,821 --> 01:28:42,570
but later on it goes on like goats
drinking by himself or something.

1396
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:46,100
And then he winds up hooking up
with like one of his teammates life.

1397
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:49,080
And that was all, but that's a whole
nother story though. We don't get along.

1398
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:52,280
We don't actually care about any of this,
but definitely old grandma.

1399
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:55,710
That part [inaudible] that's his
name. Wild thing. Rick One. They go.

1400
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:57,990
Same deal though,
right?

1401
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:02,220
You got to get the right guys
and of course nailed it. You

1402
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:07,230
nailed it. You even silly. Uh, Harris,
you know he does. Okay. You know,

1403
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,510
and then they bring out Rick Vaughn to
fit the clothes out the game or whatever

1404
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,980
and you win. So there
you go. Boom. All right.

1405
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:17,250
Wayne went back to the
book back through the book.

1406
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:22,780
If a commander thinks that all men are
the same and he treats the mass of human

1407
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:26,280
material accordingly,
he will fail.

1408
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:27,710
Okay.

1409
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:31,580
The soldiers of today have different
standards and require more enlightened

1410
01:29:31,581 --> 01:29:36,260
handling. This then the soldiers of bygone
days. This is again where he starts to,

1411
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:40,550
you realize that this guy, even though
he tries to come across all hard,

1412
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:45,910
he's actually very thoughtful about
understanding humans back to the book.

1413
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:51,290
They will no longer follow blindly and
unquestionably to an unknown end today.

1414
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:54,500
Therefore,

1415
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:59,500
a commander must ensure that his troops
always know what they are being asked to

1416
01:29:59,751 --> 01:30:03,590
do and how that fits in
with the larger plan.

1417
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,060
Okay.

1418
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,390
I have always been,
in other words,

1419
01:30:06,391 --> 01:30:07,620
they got to know why they're
doing what they're doing.

1420
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,930
I have always insisted
that before a battle,

1421
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:13,080
the essentials of the plant are known
right through the chain of command and

1422
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:15,030
finally down to the rank and file.

1423
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:18,630
The troops must know how a commander is
going to fight the battle and what part

1424
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:19,620
they are going to play in it.

1425
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:23,900
This must be explained to them by
word of mouth for that counselor.

1426
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:25,800
Far More than the written word.

1427
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:27,410
Yeah,

1428
01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:31,670
and then when the battle has been won
and the troops see that the battle has

1429
01:30:31,671 --> 01:30:33,560
gone,
as the commander said it would,

1430
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:36,680
their confidence in the high
command will be very great.

1431
01:30:36,710 --> 01:30:39,050
This confidence is beyond price.

1432
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:40,500
Yeah.

1433
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:44,130
The problem with that statement is it
puts pressure on you to stick to a plan.

1434
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:47,030
Did you get a flight that,
that make you think, oh,

1435
01:30:47,031 --> 01:30:50,100
I'm just going to stick with it because
I want everyone to think that it went

1436
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:53,730
the way I want. I wanted it to go,
no, don't just stick with a plan.

1437
01:30:53,731 --> 01:30:55,380
If it's not working,
it's not working.

1438
01:30:56,050 --> 01:31:01,050
Shift a commander must watch
carefully his own morale.

1439
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:03,350
Okay.

1440
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:06,740
A battle is a contest between the
will of two opposing commanders.

1441
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10,070
The one who's heart fails.
When the issue hangs in,

1442
01:31:10,071 --> 01:31:11,810
the balance will lose the battle.

1443
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:13,380
Okay.

1444
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,670
A commander,
in fact,

1445
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:20,090
must throughout radiate confidence
in his plan and operations,

1446
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,750
even though inwardly he may
not be too sure of the outcome.

1447
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:30,810
That's the one of those other things,
you know, people talk about transparency,

1448
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:35,880
right? Transparency. Oh, guess
what? And it's like, oh yeah,

1449
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:40,770
there's a book. There's all kinds of
book about transparency. Yeah. Like go,

1450
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,130
you got to be fully transparent
with everyone. No, actually,

1451
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,880
sometimes if I'm a little more nervous
about what we're doing and I started to

1452
01:31:47,881 --> 01:31:51,690
show that everyone's going to be nervous
about what we're doing. Yeah, man.

1453
01:31:51,691 --> 01:31:55,830
And had seen, yeah, they can up.
And sometimes too where like,

1454
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:59,530
like how you mentioned before, like some
people can't take the truth, you know,

1455
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:00,130
like,
so like

1456
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,430
if there's certain shifts going to be
made or certain like rules going to be

1457
01:32:03,431 --> 01:32:08,200
implemented or whatever,
you know, like, hey, we're,

1458
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:10,480
we're going to move,
we're going to demote this,

1459
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:14,350
or we're going to move this person out
of this department because he's just, he,

1460
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:18,580
he's ear, he stinks. Or something. Like
he has boo and he's irritating everybody,

1461
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:21,760
you know, kind of thing.
Okay. And he'll be,

1462
01:32:21,761 --> 01:32:25,840
he'll just do just as good at work
down here in the basement where he's by

1463
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:29,210
himself. Exactly. Right. You
know, and it's like, hey, hey,

1464
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:32,500
we're going to shift you over here.
And he's gonna be like, oh, cool.

1465
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:36,280
Like why though? Like I'm done to
do it. But why? DB transparent?

1466
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,560
Maybe, maybe not, but you run

1467
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,660
the good thing.

1468
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:46,530
It would be like, hey man. Hey Bro,

1469
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:50,700
let me ask you something.
If I had a booger hanging
out my nose, would you want,

1470
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,400
would you would if you had a
booger hanging out of your nose,

1471
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:57,120
what'd you want me to tell you? Everyone
says, yeah, of course. Cool. You stink.

1472
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:04,320
That's good. Yeah. What about
Stinky gies on the mat, right.

1473
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:07,200
Somebody's got to let them know,
bro, you gotta wash that thing.

1474
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:12,290
You might need a new geek. You know some
people, they have this old ratty geat.

1475
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:16,190
The smell is embedded in those things.
I had keys like that was like,

1476
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:19,320
you wash it and then you
wash it and you take it out.

1477
01:33:19,321 --> 01:33:21,690
You put it on for four minutes and you go,
Oh yeah,

1478
01:33:21,691 --> 01:33:26,220
I've got to throw this thing away.
This thing stinks, Huh? Yeah.

1479
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,460
That's true. That that would be a better
way to do it. That you can't say, hey,

1480
01:33:29,461 --> 01:33:31,140
why don't you move to the beginner class?

1481
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:37,980
Go drill over there. Go work with
the grappling dummy over there.

1482
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:38,840
It's like,

1483
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,260
oh, that's not cool. You need to tell
a brother, hey man, you stinking.

1484
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:46,460
You need a wash. Your Geek
washed Yogi immediately. Yeah,

1485
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,310
so this is, this is one of those things
where if you, if you need to talk to them,

1486
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:56,960
right? Even in that situation, you do need
to tell the truth. You know, you do new.

1487
01:33:56,961 --> 01:34:00,110
Say, hey listen man, I don't
know what's up with your hygiene

1488
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,200
needs some work.
All right,

1489
01:34:03,201 --> 01:34:07,700
so what if the company is taking this
massive financial hit and layoffs are

1490
01:34:07,701 --> 01:34:12,650
coming straight up. You lay
off one guy, he left two guys.

1491
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,340
Do you be transparent? Like, hey
guys, we're taking a massive hit.

1492
01:34:16,341 --> 01:34:20,990
We're laying off a bunch of people. Well,
yeah, not in that case. You have to say,

1493
01:34:20,991 --> 01:34:21,351
hey listen,

1494
01:34:21,351 --> 01:34:26,351
this is what's going on and this is
where we're at and we're going to do our

1495
01:34:26,811 --> 01:34:30,770
best and the best way we can do this is
by buckling down hard and working hard.

1496
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:32,970
But right now it's
going to be tight going.

1497
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:37,130
It's going to go through a tight quarter
right now we had to let go to guys.

1498
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:41,090
We're going to try and maintain what we
got, but I can't promise you anything,

1499
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:44,300
right? You gotta be yes, yes,
I'm going to be truthful.

1500
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:47,390
So maybe it is better to be transparent.
Most of the time it is.

1501
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:52,310
Most of the time it is what we do.
Well it's in this situation,

1502
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:58,600
what we're talking about is if you lack
confidence in what you're doing and you

1503
01:35:00,711 --> 01:35:05,120
start to reveal that to yeah,
got you, then that's not good.

1504
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:09,350
And you know there's, there's time.
Now let's say, let's say Echo.

1505
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:15,190
Let's say I didn't think
you were cognitively capable
of doing a job at the next

1506
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:16,064
level.

1507
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:20,810
I might not necessarily tell you that
because that's something that you can't

1508
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:24,230
necessarily change. You can't go home,
take a shower and get smarter. Right?

1509
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,790
It doesn't,
it doesn't work that way.

1510
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:30,710
You can't put on deodorant and now
you're smarter. That doesn't work.

1511
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,870
Be smelling bad is not a,

1512
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,800
is not necessarily a bad problem cause
it's something that can be fixed.

1513
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:40,160
But if you, if you aren't smart
enough, well then we have a,

1514
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:43,160
we have a situation you can't really,
I mean you can study,

1515
01:35:43,161 --> 01:35:46,100
you can work but you're not
going to get smarter. Right.

1516
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:50,690
So it might not be a great idea for me
to say, well you know I I decided not to.

1517
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,420
You know, you're not getting promoted
promoted Billy. Cause you're, you're dumb.

1518
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,900
Yeah he's just a hot tomorrow. Here's
the deal man. Just straight up.

1519
01:35:56,901 --> 01:35:58,840
You're not that smart. Right. Sure.

1520
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:02,660
So I couldn't put you in charge of
anything cause cause you're not smart.

1521
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:06,770
Now that's different than me saying,
hey listen man,

1522
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,050
six months ago if I was like,
hey listen man,

1523
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:12,920
you need to start paying attention
because what you're doing right now,

1524
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:15,400
if you're going to move up,
you got to really know you get,

1525
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:16,910
it's going to take you some extra study.

1526
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:19,380
And look I'm not the sharpest
tool in the shed and I,

1527
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:22,790
I know I have to work hard at making
this stuff happen. Do you look at your,

1528
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:25,410
do you look at your manuals at all?
Have you been studying your manual?

1529
01:36:25,411 --> 01:36:29,600
So you need to like dig into your
manuals and really know this stuff.

1530
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:32,640
If you're think you're going
to get promoted, you're
not going to get promoted.

1531
01:36:32,641 --> 01:36:34,940
And unless you know this stuff
like the back of your hand,

1532
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,740
you need to get in the game.

1533
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:40,190
So if we've already been through the
whole thing and you actually got out the

1534
01:36:40,191 --> 01:36:42,800
manuals and you tried and you didn't
make anything happen while you guys what,

1535
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:45,950
hey man, there's just not that many
opportunities at this next one.

1536
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:46,581
And by the way,

1537
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:51,470
I think there's another kind of course
of career course that I have thinking for

1538
01:36:51,471 --> 01:36:55,970
you. You know, so let's talk about
that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah,

1539
01:36:55,971 --> 01:36:57,300
definitely some that,

1540
01:36:57,350 --> 01:37:02,350
some that requires large biceps I think
is going to be your area of expertise.

1541
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,130
Thanks.
Check

1542
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:14,390
going back to the book in order that he
may keep clear of unimportant details

1543
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:19,400
and thus have time for the quiet thought
and reflection of higher commander must

1544
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:24,380
work through a chief of staff and thus
avoid having to deal separately with the

1545
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:26,450
heads of all branches.

1546
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:29,870
So far as I'm aware of the British
army is the only army which was,

1547
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:34,370
which does not adopt the chief of
staff system. In my own experience,

1548
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:35,800
it is quite possible to,

1549
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,710
is quite impossible to exercise high
command successfully in war without it.

1550
01:37:39,711 --> 01:37:44,330
I've adopted the chief of staff system
myself throughout this war and could not

1551
01:37:44,331 --> 01:37:45,110
have succeeded otherwise.

1552
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:48,590
So you've got to have someone that's
going to handle things for you.

1553
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,290
A little things you know,
I was talking about the um,

1554
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:57,100
the senior enlisted guy in a platoon
chief or an a task unit or in a platoon or

1555
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:00,150
a company,
an army company.

1556
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:04,650
The senior enlisted guy I always said
was the action arm of the commander.

1557
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:09,000
So when you need something done,
I don't have time to go do it myself.

1558
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,730
And if I go do it myself when
I've lost the bigger picture,

1559
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,200
but if I have something critical,

1560
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:17,850
you've got the senior enlisted individual
that has the most tactical experience,

1561
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:22,140
has the most, uh, 40 the most
respects. When you say, Hey, chief,

1562
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,770
that building over there hasn't been
cleared yet. I don't know what's going on.

1563
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,080
Go clear that thing.
And he'll say,

1564
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:31,680
Roger that or the platoon sergeant
or the company first sergeant.

1565
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:35,130
Those guys should have the experience
and the technical expertise and then be

1566
01:38:35,131 --> 01:38:38,910
utilized as the action arm
that can make things happen.

1567
01:38:38,911 --> 01:38:41,070
Now that's not exactly what
a chief of staff of is.

1568
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,420
It's actually quite different,

1569
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:45,990
but it's similar in the fact that
you can't get sucked into the weeds.

1570
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:48,990
And if you,
if you're the commander of a,

1571
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:52,830
of a division and you're in the
weeds all the time, you don't have,

1572
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:56,280
you can't see what's happening. And it's
the same thing in a business. If the,

1573
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:00,030
if the CEO of the business is
running the business daily,

1574
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:01,890
he's not looking up and out.

1575
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:05,280
He's looking down and in and that's
not going to allow him to make foresee

1576
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:06,810
what's coming down the pipe in the future.

1577
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:09,120
And that's pretty much what it says here.

1578
01:39:09,121 --> 01:39:12,600
No officer whose daily life is spent at
the consideration of details or who has

1579
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:12,930
not.

1580
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:17,040
Time for quiet thought and reflection can
make a sound plan of battle or conduct

1581
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:18,300
large scale operations.

1582
01:39:18,301 --> 01:39:22,350
The wise commander is the one who uses
a chief of staff who sees it very few

1583
01:39:22,351 --> 01:39:26,910
papers or letters himself and who sees
that the majority of reports that are

1584
01:39:26,911 --> 01:39:29,970
made to him,
our verbal and short,

1585
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:34,380
only in this way, giving himself plenty
of time for quiet font reflection.

1586
01:39:34,381 --> 01:39:35,130
Will he be,

1587
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:39,060
will he keep himself mentally fresh and
capable of producing the sound plan of

1588
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:44,061
operations which will defeat his enemy
for the plan of operations must always be

1589
01:39:44,131 --> 01:39:45,780
made by the commander and he must not be.

1590
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:49,500
I must not be forced upon
him by his staff. Bias, bias,

1591
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:53,250
circumstances or by the enemy.
That's pretty important.

1592
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:58,700
Why are you allowing the circumstances
or the enemy to dictate how you're going

1593
01:39:58,771 --> 01:40:00,420
to do things?
That's not a good call.

1594
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:09,120
A commander must decide how he will
fight the battle before it begins.

1595
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:14,100
He must decide how he will
use the military effort at
his disposal to force the

1596
01:40:14,101 --> 01:40:18,420
battle to swing the way he wishes
it to go. To be able to do this,

1597
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:23,280
his dispositions must be so balanced
that he can ignore enemy reactions and

1598
01:40:23,281 --> 01:40:26,310
continue with his own plan
until he is certain of success.

1599
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:31,440
He has got to strive to read the mind of
his opponent to anticipate heavy enemy

1600
01:40:31,441 --> 01:40:35,640
reactions to his own moves and to
take quick steps to prevent any enemy

1601
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:37,260
interference with his own plan.
Again,

1602
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:40,200
this is a little bit sketchy to me
cause now we're talking about, hey,

1603
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:43,860
I'm just driving forward with my plan no
matter what. I don't like that attitude.

1604
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:47,400
I want to be flexible.
I'm going to try and stick to my plan,

1605
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:52,340
but I'm going to be flexible.
This, this is one where you know,

1606
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:56,500
man, I don't even know this is,
this is one of those things where

1607
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:01,030
sometimes I would get guys that
would there be a little change.

1608
01:41:01,031 --> 01:41:01,750
They come up with a plan.

1609
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:05,140
They'd spent all this time planning for
a mission and there'd be little change.

1610
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:08,220
Maybe they getting ready to go out.

1611
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:11,080
Some imagery comes in and it shows
something little bit different.

1612
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:12,220
Or maybe they get some Intel.

1613
01:41:12,221 --> 01:41:14,380
It's a little bit different and
they decide they're going to,

1614
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:16,240
they've already planned.
They've already rehearsed,

1615
01:41:16,241 --> 01:41:17,290
they already know what they're doing.

1616
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:19,750
Everyone's kind of walked through and
they decide they're going to change their

1617
01:41:19,751 --> 01:41:23,770
whole plan because of some little
thing. And I would say, man,

1618
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:27,190
don't change your whole plan. I get
you want to make a little adjustment.

1619
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:29,660
Do you want to take a little fire team
and have them make an adjustment to take

1620
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:32,230
a squad, make them do something
that's, that's okay. Don't,

1621
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:35,140
don't try and rearrange your whole plan.
You've already rehearsed.

1622
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:39,640
You have to unrehearsed. You know how hard
that is if the unprogrammed your team,

1623
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:44,660
that is really hard to do.
So sometimes, and I used to,

1624
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:49,850
this is actually one of those things that
slowly I don't really talk about very

1625
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:53,140
often because,

1626
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:57,640
but I used to used to be in the the
combat leadership brief I used to give,

1627
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:00,520
it used to say don't fall for
6% advantage over the enemy.

1628
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,420
And what I meant by that was,
and I used to draw a target up on the,

1629
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:09,310
on the dry erase board and I'd say, okay,
you're going to take down this target.

1630
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,420
So you come up with a plan, how do you
only want to do it? And I was just,

1631
01:42:12,570 --> 01:42:15,460
we set up an l and basic
maneuver, okay, cool,

1632
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:18,790
you're getting ready
to go out and do this.

1633
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:23,820
And you find out that there
was an outhouse over the
berm over here and there's

1634
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:27,430
a chance two o'clock in the morning
that the guy could be in that outhouse.

1635
01:42:27,431 --> 01:42:32,110
What do you want to do? And some guys
would completely change their whole plan,

1636
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:34,780
completely changed their whole plan.
Meanwhile,

1637
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:37,240
we're launching in two minutes
or eight minutes or 20 minutes.

1638
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:40,360
They've planned this, they've rehearsed
it. Everyone knows what their job was.

1639
01:42:40,361 --> 01:42:42,680
The whole team came up with a
plan together. I mean it's like a,

1640
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:47,910
it's really in their brains and now they
see this little detail because there's

1641
01:42:48,191 --> 01:42:51,300
a chance that at three o'clock in the
morning when you hit this target that the,

1642
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:54,040
the guy that you're looking
for is in the outhouse,

1643
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:57,550
so we're going to change our whole plan
to make up for this tiny percentage

1644
01:42:57,551 --> 01:43:01,420
chance that this guy's even in
the outhouse. Not a good call.

1645
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:05,770
Can you break off a fire team that's
going to maneuver to a position where they

1646
01:43:05,771 --> 01:43:07,600
can at least keep an eye on that on house?
That's fine,

1647
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:11,830
but don't change your whole damn plan
based on this little 6% chance that the

1648
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,340
enemy might do something you
didn't expect or know the enemy.

1649
01:43:15,341 --> 01:43:18,050
That's something is very
unlikely of happening.

1650
01:43:18,051 --> 01:43:20,320
It's not that you didn't expect it,
things that you don't expect.

1651
01:43:20,321 --> 01:43:23,830
That's why you have contingency plans
which is like, hey, when we fly in,

1652
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:26,560
if we see any other outbuildings
that we missed on the imagery,

1653
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:31,390
we have a fire team designated to go and
get eyes on those things from the high

1654
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:33,940
ground. Oh, okay. Cool. That's
a contingency plan that works.

1655
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:38,350
Going back to the commander here,

1656
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:43,770
he has gone always to be a very clear
thinker and must aim to be always one move

1657
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:47,090
ahead of his opponent. I actually
prefer it to be about five booths

1658
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:50,860
to do this.
He must simplify the,

1659
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:57,670
whenever a problem arises he must think
out the few points which will form the

1660
01:43:58,281 --> 01:44:00,290
framework of the solution.

1661
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:05,810
The few things that will really matter
so long as the solution to the problem is

1662
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:07,730
based on those few things
that really matter.

1663
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:12,260
The solution will be on the right lines,
solid,

1664
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:15,560
solid.
You have like this,

1665
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:20,330
just this pathway and as long in the path
at the end of the pathway is what you

1666
01:44:20,331 --> 01:44:23,630
want to achieve. As long as you're
doing things that are on the pathway,

1667
01:44:23,631 --> 01:44:24,600
you're going,
you're getting there.

1668
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:27,530
When you start doing things that are
off the pathway, we've got a problem.

1669
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:29,710
Sometimes you've got to look at
your, your subordinates and say, hey,

1670
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,690
it's not even on the path in the direction
that we're heading because it doesn't

1671
01:44:32,691 --> 01:44:36,860
seem like a domain. A commander
must at all times. Exercise,

1672
01:44:36,861 --> 01:44:40,160
personal command.
That is to say he must give,

1673
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:45,610
must see and give full verbal orders or
instructions to his subordinate generals

1674
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:48,410
on how the battle is to be fought.

1675
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:52,370
Operational Command in the field
must be direct and personal.

1676
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:56,600
No written order can ever be the
equivalent of a direct verbal command.

1677
01:44:57,230 --> 01:45:02,210
Interesting. And I've, my standard is,

1678
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:06,980
I do both. I do both. I say, Hey,
echo, here's what we're doing. Hey,

1679
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:08,960
do you understand this? Do
you have any questions? Cool.

1680
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:12,590
And I send you a message that says,
Hey, echo, this is what we talked about.

1681
01:45:12,591 --> 01:45:17,180
This is what you're doing and
making sure you understand if I can,

1682
01:45:17,181 --> 01:45:20,540
I'm going to do both. If you want
to do one. Yes, verbal is better.

1683
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:23,503
Most of the time

1684
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:28,940
a commander must therefore understand
how to give verbal orders to his

1685
01:45:28,941 --> 01:45:33,560
subordinates. No two generals are the
same. Each require different treatment.

1686
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:34,910
Each will react differently.

1687
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:39,260
By exercising personal commander
commander can exert a far greater and more

1688
01:45:39,261 --> 01:45:43,910
exact influenced on the battle and the
confidence which will grow up between the

1689
01:45:43,911 --> 01:45:46,790
commander and his generals
will be of great value.

1690
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:51,970
The whole chain of command can VUSs and
only thus be built into a United team

1691
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:55,790
whose strength is based on mutual
confidence and understanding.

1692
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:57,440
Yeah,

1693
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:01,520
relationships. That's all relationships
is what he's talking about right there.

1694
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:08,290
When the whole army is built into one
great team United in working all out for a

1695
01:46:08,451 --> 01:46:11,330
common purpose,
the result is terrific.

1696
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:17,920
Success in war is due to good teamwork
by all members of the fighting forces and

1697
01:46:17,931 --> 01:46:22,250
to the correct use, which is made of
all members by the team of the team,

1698
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:23,600
by the commander and his staff.

1699
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:29,210
But failure in war is always
due to one of two causes.

1700
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:30,320
Okay.

1701
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:35,320
To faulty command or to bad
staff work and sometimes do both.

1702
01:46:36,810 --> 01:46:37,260
Okay.

1703
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:42,150
I can think of no instance where the
failure has been due to a failure of the

1704
01:46:42,151 --> 01:46:46,770
fighting man. The British fighting man
will always do. What is asked of him,

1705
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:50,100
but you must make sure

1706
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:55,280
that he understands what he is asked
to do and also that it is within his

1707
01:46:57,301 --> 01:47:00,750
capacity to do it.
Okay.

1708
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,600
If your team is not doing what
it is you want them to do,

1709
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:06,060
the first person you
should check is yourself.

1710
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,240
If you're giving people complex
orders that they don't understand,

1711
01:47:09,241 --> 01:47:11,310
there's no possible way they
can execute those plans.

1712
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:16,430
And here's how he closes this out.
Finally,

1713
01:47:16,431 --> 01:47:21,431
I do not believe that today a commander
can inspire great armies or single units

1714
01:47:22,071 --> 01:47:26,360
or even individual men and lead them to
achieve great victories unless he has a

1715
01:47:26,361 --> 01:47:28,640
proper sense of religious truth.

1716
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:30,250
Yeah,

1717
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:35,250
and he must be prepared to acknowledge
it and to lead his troops in the light of

1718
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:37,590
that truth.

1719
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:42,600
He must always keep his finger on
the spiritual pulse of his army

1720
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:49,560
and he must be very sure
that the spiritual purpose
which inspires them is right

1721
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:54,610
and true and it's clearly
expounded to one and all.

1722
01:47:56,550 --> 01:48:00,570
Unless he does this,
he can expect no lasting success.

1723
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:04,200
So what you got to believe in,
what you're doing.

1724
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:07,260
Okay.

1725
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:10,530
For all leadership, I believe, is
based on the spiritual quality,

1726
01:48:10,531 --> 01:48:13,590
the power to inspire others to follow.

1727
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:19,160
And this spiritual quality may
be for good or may be for evil.

1728
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:27,880
In many cases, this quality has
been devoted toward personal ends.

1729
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:28,580
Yeah.

1730
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:33,260
And was partly or wholly evil.
And whenever this was.

1731
01:48:33,261 --> 01:48:35,840
So in the end it failed

1732
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,560
for leadership,
which is evil.

1733
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:43,530
While it may temporarily succeed,

1734
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:49,010
always carries within it the
seeds of its own destruction.

1735
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:59,370
That's it. That's it. That's a solid
one. Leadership, which is evil,

1736
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:02,400
while it may temporarily succeed,

1737
01:49:02,401 --> 01:49:06,090
always carries within it the
seeds of its own destruction.

1738
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:09,600
And that is a theory
that I fully believe it.

1739
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:11,250
Yeah.

1740
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:15,540
And I mean,
I believe in it on that level,

1741
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:18,343
on that

1742
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,920
hi consequence level.

1743
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:23,140
Yeah.

1744
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:26,230
But I also believe it on a,
on a much less dramatic level.

1745
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:28,660
And this is something that
you deal with every day.

1746
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:30,820
Okay.

1747
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:34,630
Yeah. And that's this, the leader
that is looking out for himself,

1748
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,150
the leader that puts
himself above his team,

1749
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:39,370
that leaders eventually going to fail.

1750
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:41,700
Okay.

1751
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,950
Even though they may temporarily succeed.
Same thing.

1752
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:45,780
They may temporarily succeed,

1753
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:50,380
but eventually they are going to fail.
That's what's going to happen.

1754
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:55,200
And I will tell you something else that
is true and that is the opposite is the

1755
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:59,980
of that. And that is if you are doing
the right things for the right things,

1756
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,150
for the right reasons,

1757
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:06,840
then you may temporarily fail.

1758
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:12,060
But you will have the seeds for victory,

1759
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:18,820
the seeds for victory. And the reason
that I say seeds is very specific.

1760
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:22,630
There's a reason why I'm saying that is
because seeds are not guaranteed to grow,

1761
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:23,501
right?

1762
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:25,720
Just because you have good intention
doesn't mean that you're going to win.

1763
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:27,670
It doesn't mean that you're
going to achieve victory.

1764
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:32,380
It means we have the seeds for victory
because once you plant those seeds,

1765
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:36,730
you have to water them and you have to
nourish them and you have to protect them

1766
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:41,110
from birds and from
squirrels and from vermin.

1767
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:44,390
And you have to work.

1768
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:48,380
You have to plant those seeds and then
you have to make those seeds grow.

1769
01:50:48,381 --> 01:50:51,230
And if you do that

1770
01:50:54,150 --> 01:50:56,220
and you continue to do that,
then

1771
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:01,530
you move forward and you're
doing it for the right reasons.

1772
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:05,460
In the end you are going to win.

1773
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:14,390
And you know that that middle section
of this Monte went pretty deep talking

1774
01:51:16,921 --> 01:51:21,921
about morale and he has a whole nother
section here that I've got on Robin.

1775
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:27,200
I think we're gonna save that for
another podcast since we're all ready.

1776
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:31,890
Two hours, dude. Until then,

1777
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:36,300
Echo Charles.
If we want to keep our morale high,

1778
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:41,520
if we want to nourish the seeds
and we want to protect them,

1779
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:45,360
sure. And we want to do the right
things for the right reason.

1780
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:47,880
Always so that we can win.
Yes.

1781
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:50,520
Dominate or we are we doing dominate,

1782
01:51:50,521 --> 01:51:52,320
kind of looking at them and
they were looking to dominate,

1783
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:56,500
possibly looking to dominate. When
I'm looking at dominate men. No,

1784
01:51:56,700 --> 01:52:00,990
but you gotta you gotta be able to,
we'll probably come,

1785
01:52:00,991 --> 01:52:03,090
we'll revisit that word. Yeah. Full.

1786
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:07,320
We'll do the full study
of that word and dig deep.

1787
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:10,530
At a minimum it means, hey,
we're going to dominate.

1788
01:52:11,570 --> 01:52:15,570
It's got dominates the room in a
positive way. Yeah. At the extreme.

1789
01:52:15,571 --> 01:52:17,550
It's like this guy just
has a dominant personality.

1790
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:20,790
Prom is how often do you see with a person
with a dominant personality that rubs

1791
01:52:20,791 --> 01:52:25,490
everyone the wrong way all the time.
Dominant like Domini or yeah,

1792
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:26,700
this guy's got to dominate and no one,

1793
01:52:26,701 --> 01:52:29,250
no one wants them on the team cause
you can't get a word in edge wise.

1794
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:32,580
That's why I questioned
the use of this word.

1795
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:37,530
Now that being said,
and I can see this,

1796
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:38,963
I can see this,

1797
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:45,020
just because someone has the will to
dominate and it's strong doesn't mean that

1798
01:52:46,101 --> 01:52:49,640
they sit there and rub everyone the
wrong way because if they really had the

1799
01:52:49,641 --> 01:52:50,690
will to dominate,

1800
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:55,720
what they would do is back off and allow
others to step up and allow others to

1801
01:52:56,811 --> 01:53:00,590
have their say and allow others to
try and lead and to actually lead.

1802
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,830
If they were really
going to play the game,

1803
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:07,790
they might have the
strongest will to dominate,

1804
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:13,990
but they don't act that way because they
realize that that's counterproductive

1805
01:53:14,361 --> 01:53:19,280
to actually dominating. Yeah. You
look like you're confused. I mean,

1806
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:24,980
yeah. I mean, I don't know. So check
it out, confused. But I think that if

1807
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:27,980
I feel like there's just,

1808
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:32,420
there's a more general broad
use or meaning for that
word. That's what I think.

1809
01:53:32,421 --> 01:53:35,840
So I think you're right.
That being said,

1810
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:41,530
it could also be if you have
somebody that has a strong,

1811
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:43,970
incredibly powerful will to dominate,

1812
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:49,300
but they realize that that is abrasive
and it is not the best way to actually

1813
01:53:50,001 --> 01:53:51,200
win in a situation,

1814
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:56,800
they will modulate and they will tamper
that will to dominate so that it best

1815
01:53:58,341 --> 01:54:03,341
serves the accomplishment of the
mission and therefore best serves their

1816
01:54:03,741 --> 01:54:07,040
domination. Yeah, and I dig it. You know,

1817
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:10,580
it just does feel at this by this point
right now it feels like that might be

1818
01:54:10,581 --> 01:54:13,160
kind of a reach. It's like that, um,

1819
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:16,430
thing that I talked
about at the muster of,

1820
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:21,980
of what is,
what is leadership and,

1821
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:25,250
and I talk about how like
leadership is winning at all costs.

1822
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,250
And there's been some people that say,
woof,

1823
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:31,970
winning at all costs seems like
a bad attitude, but the whole,

1824
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:36,410
cause you put a clip like that for an
advertisement for the muster in a little

1825
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,630
muster clip. Sure. You put me going,

1826
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:41,780
leadership is winning at all costs.
Right.

1827
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,070
And there was some of that combination
commented on our, on the echelon front,

1828
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:47,151
extreme ownership,

1829
01:54:47,151 --> 01:54:51,770
Facebook private group that you know,

1830
01:54:51,771 --> 01:54:53,930
I don't know if I like,
this is a seems a little bit,

1831
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:58,850
that doesn't seem like a good attitude
and you know, I replied that, hey,

1832
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:03,290
you have to hear the whole thing.
That's only, that's only a few seconds.

1833
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:07,250
Because when it goes on to say
is if you really want to win,

1834
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:11,990
then you'll compromise.
Then you'll make exceptions.

1835
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:16,100
Then you build relationships and you'll
take a back step and you'll put your,

1836
01:55:16,190 --> 01:55:19,820
you will subordinate your ego.
That was the biggest thing.

1837
01:55:19,821 --> 01:55:20,670
That's the biggest myth.

1838
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:25,250
We will subordinate your ego because
you will put the mission above your own

1839
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:28,370
personal will to dominate.
You'll,

1840
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:33,590
you'll subordinate your will to dominate
so that you can actually win in the

1841
01:55:33,591 --> 01:55:36,020
long term. In the long game. Yeah.

1842
01:55:36,630 --> 01:55:39,830
And it's important to
remember if you heard it here,

1843
01:55:39,831 --> 01:55:44,070
the whole speech or would it, or the
whole segment will say is that yeah, you

1844
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,180
talk like a lot about,
um,

1845
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:51,720
where like dislike battles and then
there's the overall victory and like this,

1846
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:55,470
all this stuff and then sure, there's
the dramatic parts when you're like,

1847
01:55:55,471 --> 01:55:59,430
nothing's going to get in my way.
But yeah,

1848
01:55:59,431 --> 01:56:02,790
like you sacrifice so much where,
okay,

1849
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:05,920
so when you say we need all costs, it kind
of, this is what it sounds like. You've,

1850
01:56:05,921 --> 01:56:07,830
you just hear that line,
nothing's going to get him mind.

1851
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:11,160
It sounds like even at the cost of
lighting, half of my men or something,

1852
01:56:11,161 --> 01:56:12,840
I ended up not only that,
but in a corporate world,

1853
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:14,430
it's like I'll just step
on anyone I need to write.

1854
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:20,090
I'll send bad product out to the consumers
and I don't care if they get hurt her,

1855
01:56:20,091 --> 01:56:22,720
but I don't care if it's, I don't care,
whatever, I'm just going to win. I'm here.

1856
01:56:22,721 --> 01:56:26,760
Yeah. Like that. Yeah. That's, that's what
people think. So in that guy's defense,

1857
01:56:26,761 --> 01:56:30,360
it sounds like that. But again,
the whole speech, it really,

1858
01:56:30,361 --> 01:56:33,840
I mean really the one of the main,
actually the takeaway, if not anything,

1859
01:56:33,841 --> 01:56:38,670
is like winning. What is winning? Like
w you know, if I lose half of my men,

1860
01:56:38,671 --> 01:56:42,400
it did you really win? I
think you actually say that
exact thing. He's like, no,

1861
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:45,180
that's not,
it's not a victory.

1862
01:56:45,181 --> 01:56:48,540
But also how can you carry on with your
mission and your mission and capable.

1863
01:56:48,541 --> 01:56:52,050
Now I'm actually putting, I'm
actually putting that, I'm going to,

1864
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:55,740
I'm going to write that down,
capture that,

1865
01:56:55,770 --> 01:57:00,520
and I'm going to Redo it for ETF
online. What? That part? Yeah.

1866
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:03,510
You know, so that way people can
understand what winning at all costs.

1867
01:57:03,730 --> 01:57:07,750
What it means when I'm talking about,
yeah. So we'll put that on e f on line.

1868
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:10,350
If anybody wants to check that out.

1869
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:14,270
If you don't know what that is,
you,

1870
01:57:14,590 --> 01:57:19,590
if online is a interactive leadership
training from my company Echelon Front

1871
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:27,000
where we traveled the
world teaching companies,

1872
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:31,770
businesses, organizations about
leadership in the course of doing that,

1873
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:34,740
we eventually got to a point where a,

1874
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,850
we couldn't serve us all the people
that wanted our service and B,

1875
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,450
some of the companies
that we could service,

1876
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:43,830
we couldn't service all their employees
because they have 50,000 employees and

1877
01:57:43,831 --> 01:57:46,560
they want to have everyone get
trained to by echelon front.

1878
01:57:46,561 --> 01:57:51,561
So talking to Lafe during a board
meeting or you surf meaning?

1879
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:55,470
Yes. So Lafe and I were
surfing, I said a brother,

1880
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:00,680
we need to figure out a way
to scale this stuff and we,

1881
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,020
you know, I said, let's, let's
look at doing something online.

1882
01:58:04,021 --> 01:58:09,000
And Lafe was initially like, which makes
sense by the way. Yeah, for sure. No,

1883
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:12,960
and I, I, I wanted to explore it. I
wasn't like all in out of the gate,

1884
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:16,620
but I was feeling pretty good about it
because I'd seen some stuff Lafe really

1885
01:58:16,621 --> 01:58:18,730
hadn't seen anything. You
know, he basically seen,

1886
01:58:19,190 --> 01:58:23,670
well you used to get trained online
in the navy for some just the most

1887
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:26,640
ridiculous sort of, uh, things.

1888
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:30,750
They'd send you some online training
course about if you get a Dui, this is,

1889
01:58:30,860 --> 01:58:34,140
you know, check this box if you think
you're going to be in trouble, you know,

1890
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,690
they're just really not the best training.

1891
01:58:36,691 --> 01:58:38,280
And that's kind of what life had in mind.

1892
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:42,040
But eventually we to take

1893
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,680
a look at it and once we
looked at it, it's like, oh
man, there's the capabilities.

1894
01:58:44,730 --> 01:58:47,290
Unbelievable to do interactive
training and all that stuff.

1895
01:58:47,291 --> 01:58:50,290
So we invested in it,

1896
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:54,940
we did it and now we've got this thing
and we're using it primarily we were

1897
01:58:54,941 --> 01:58:58,240
using it primarily for our,
for our enterprise clients.

1898
01:58:58,241 --> 01:59:01,030
So we're national in front of is working
with a company and they go, well,

1899
01:59:01,031 --> 01:59:03,220
what are we going to do with
our other 14,000 employees?

1900
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:05,710
How are we going to train them?
Well here you go now. Now,

1901
01:59:05,711 --> 01:59:10,690
that's where they're doing their training
through that great feedback and you

1902
01:59:10,691 --> 01:59:13,690
know the, the decision was,
well you know there's not,

1903
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:18,691
everyone is in a big company and so maybe
some of the smaller companies or just

1904
01:59:19,301 --> 01:59:22,160
individuals cause cause
sometimes you know,

1905
01:59:22,161 --> 01:59:24,160
look at some of those people come to the
muster and they're paying their own way

1906
01:59:24,161 --> 01:59:26,910
to come to the monster
obviously and their,

1907
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:31,090
their companies not supporting
it but they want to improve.

1908
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:32,980
So that's why they're there at the muster.

1909
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,740
Well it's the same thing
with the half online.

1910
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:39,400
Something sometimes you might just do it
on your own because you want to become

1911
01:59:39,401 --> 01:59:43,700
a better leader and why not get the
experience of the echelon front team, the,

1912
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:48,310
the principles in practice you
get to try them. So that's,

1913
01:59:48,610 --> 01:59:51,790
that's what it is. So anyways,
where we add modules every month,

1914
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:56,791
like new training and so I'm going to put
the what is leadership and the winning

1915
01:59:57,071 --> 02:00:01,570
at all costs thing on there so people can
listen to what that's really about and

1916
02:00:01,571 --> 02:00:03,840
what it really means.
Yeah.

1917
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:06,790
That broader views
important in my opinion.

1918
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:10,240
Also what's important in my opinion,

1919
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:14,440
is the ghee you get for Jujitsu
when you're doing, you did to us.

1920
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:17,920
Here's the thing, when you started
just doing, you put on a key,

1921
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:19,630
you don't have any basis for comparison.

1922
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:21,310
You're not gonna understand
how important that is.

1923
02:00:22,570 --> 02:00:27,570
Do you want to put it on a straight
jacket when you take a drive around the

1924
02:00:28,301 --> 02:00:32,350
block? No. Correct.
Sometimes you have to her,

1925
02:00:32,351 --> 02:00:37,351
but you didn't do and that's what it'll
feel like if you buy one of these other

1926
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:44,020
gies. Yeah, sometimes. Anyway,
so the g you get his origin,

1927
02:00:44,021 --> 02:00:48,820
you get an origin g many
selections on there. Yeah.

1928
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:53,200
To fit who you are and also
there's genes on there.

1929
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:55,330
Yes, it is. Yeah.

1930
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:58,900
Did I say origin jeans made
America American Denim,

1931
02:00:58,930 --> 02:01:03,070
American denim and they
don't have are alive. Well,

1932
02:01:03,071 --> 02:01:05,920
you need to order a pair then. Oh,
all right. Maybe I'll get some. Okay.

1933
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:10,990
There you go. Yeah, they're alive. They
are awesome. Highest quality possible.

1934
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:12,910
Every detail go.

1935
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,380
If you want to find out
what cause the genes there.

1936
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:20,950
Right now the price point is 124 bucks.

1937
02:01:21,370 --> 02:01:22,810
That's a lot of money for a pair of jeans.

1938
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:26,710
I understand that if you buy two pairs
is 99 bucks each. Here's the deal.

1939
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:30,610
If you want to know why
they cost that much,

1940
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:34,980
going on to origin Bjj,
um,

1941
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:39,500
Facebook and watch [inaudible]
video where he breaks down

1942
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:43,130
the details in the genes.
You can see the whole thing.

1943
02:01:43,131 --> 02:01:47,810
Why every little detail is
covered. Denim pockets, belt,

1944
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:51,860
every little thing is done perfectly
to the next level and so they're more

1945
02:01:51,861 --> 02:01:52,400
expensive.

1946
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:56,390
They're also more expensive cause
we're just kicking it off once we get,

1947
02:01:56,450 --> 02:01:59,870
once we keep building him we'll
get more efficient. So yeah,

1948
02:01:59,871 --> 02:02:01,970
eventually the price is gonna come down
if you can't afford it right now. I man,

1949
02:02:01,971 --> 02:02:03,440
that's cool. That's cool. I get it.

1950
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:06,860
Do genes have the whole
situation of the first at dish?

1951
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:10,980
Well they are technically right now you
can get first. The first judicious. Yeah,

1952
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:15,200
but that would be like a
first batch of them first.

1953
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:19,210
The rashes is live right now.
Yeah, go first. A dish. Right.

1954
02:02:19,211 --> 02:02:23,180
You ever seen those like designer jeans
that cost like $300 how they're made.

1955
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:27,290
This is where if you see people that
are scraping them with rocks and stuff,

1956
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:32,090
cause I've seen this, it's worse than
that. So they get like regular jeans,

1957
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:35,480
whatever, and it's a certain color and
it just denim from wherever and they,

1958
02:02:35,481 --> 02:02:38,870
you know, this factory in, I
forget where, but you know,

1959
02:02:38,871 --> 02:02:42,500
a factory in a factory in China
treat. Yeah. I think it's China,

1960
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:46,430
Pakistan or in India. And
there's uh, uh, you know,

1961
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:51,220
these little kids that are nine years
old exposed to chemicals. Yeah, yeah,

1962
02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:55,670
yeah. I saw the one I saw on a little
bit. It was more team than that,

1963
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:58,310
but nonetheless,
they were like super,

1964
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:01,040
like they're like $300 jeans or
to fish or something like this.

1965
02:03:01,370 --> 02:03:03,580
And they go and the way they're
made, I'm like, Bro, how is it,

1966
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:06,170
how is that even worth $300?
Like they,

1967
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:09,770
they cut the jeans like normal and
it's like denim, you know, whatever.

1968
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:13,730
And then they do them and they put like
this steam on them and then they send it

1969
02:03:13,731 --> 02:03:17,000
to the next person,
the next station in the factory.

1970
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:21,260
The next station has this like it's
almost like a, like a fishing line on a,

1971
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:24,680
what do you call like a wheel,
like a tomato look abused or whatever.

1972
02:03:24,681 --> 02:03:25,371
That's exactly right.

1973
02:03:25,371 --> 02:03:28,670
So it goes and it spins on the genes
and it makes it look a certain level of

1974
02:03:28,671 --> 02:03:32,960
abuse or whether to, what do
you call it? Distress, distress.

1975
02:03:32,990 --> 02:03:35,010
And then it goes to the
next little station and the,

1976
02:03:35,011 --> 02:03:37,640
and this person at this station is just
doing every single one. Same thing,

1977
02:03:37,641 --> 02:03:39,380
put up a book,
next station.

1978
02:03:39,381 --> 02:03:43,220
The next station has like a little
another thing to help it kind of do it.

1979
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:44,270
Then the next session folded.

1980
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:49,340
And so I watched that thing with Pete
and my point and I'm like, Oh man,

1981
02:03:49,341 --> 02:03:52,440
that makes sense. This all makes
sense. Like this is deep, you know,

1982
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:56,240
there's good made me want
to get one obviously.

1983
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:59,480
But I thought back to that
factory and I'm thinking, man,

1984
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:03,350
how is that worth like $300
or whatever for that thing.

1985
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:07,520
It was such a throwaway process like
when you, when you see it and feel it.

1986
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:12,200
So I dig it man. It d and they are made
in America by the way. Yeah, for sure.

1987
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,030
They're made in America
than made in Maine.

1988
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:17,690
There the cottons from
America has died in America.

1989
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:22,400
It's woven in America and yeah,
the price point is,

1990
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:25,400
is more expensive than what you're
going to pay. And Hey, you know,

1991
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:28,880
I don't want you to go out and spend
your last dollar on this pair of origin

1992
02:04:28,881 --> 02:04:29,990
jeans.
No Man.

1993
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:34,750
But if you want to help
out and you want the bay,

1994
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:37,470
they all have the best possible genes
you get. If you want them, then cool.

1995
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:38,453
That'd be cool.

1996
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:41,400
Yup.
But don't need to freak out.

1997
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:47,280
I'm not freaking out on my end.
We're trying to make good,

1998
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:50,850
we're trying to make good quality
products and our real mission is longterm

1999
02:04:50,851 --> 02:04:55,040
mission to bring manufacturing back
to America. You know, we want these,

2000
02:04:55,150 --> 02:04:57,480
we want to get these jeans down to
a price point. How do we do that?

2001
02:04:57,481 --> 02:05:01,560
Increase the volume, make more of
them. There'll be economies of scale.

2002
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:05,880
We'll be able to lower the prices
for sure. Absolutely. You know what?

2003
02:05:05,881 --> 02:05:09,260
We talked to some gene people,
Denim people, they, they,

2004
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:14,250
they wanted us to charge $300 for these
jeans. Yeah. Cause they're like, well,

2005
02:05:14,251 --> 02:05:18,660
you know, these are, wait,
what did they say? They were
premium. Yeah. Premium jeans.

2006
02:05:18,661 --> 02:05:21,540
But there was another word
too. Anyways, you know there's,

2007
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:24,990
there's people that pay that kind of
money for jeans. I'm not one of them.

2008
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:29,090
Yeah, no, you know, I don't know.
But anyways, yeah, either way.

2009
02:05:29,091 --> 02:05:33,740
Well the good news about the whole
situation, including made in America,

2010
02:05:33,741 --> 02:05:37,190
they do have other stuff. So an eighth
man, I haven't talked about these shorts.

2011
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:39,770
So, and I don't know if you
notice what I wear all the time,

2012
02:05:40,220 --> 02:05:44,660
but the only thing I wear is the
shorts only one straight up. I mean,

2013
02:05:44,661 --> 02:05:46,640
unless it's like, you know, to
train or something like this.

2014
02:05:46,641 --> 02:05:49,550
But like just around is
only the origin shorts,

2015
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:52,160
shark sharks or whatever.
Yeah.

2016
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:55,280
I have like six pairs of them
and it's like the same thing.

2017
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:57,590
So I'm sure it's like, you know,
if you go through your routine,

2018
02:05:57,591 --> 02:05:59,390
like people at the store,
they're like proud Skype.

2019
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:02,540
Where's the same shorts every day,
but well one of them has a green logo,

2020
02:06:02,541 --> 02:06:05,030
the other one has a black logo.
Either way.

2021
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:09,950
These are literally the best shorts
in the like ever made that I've put on

2022
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:13,220
straight up. Yes. So I can get
those Charlie. There you go.

2023
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:16,550
Custom made in the mirror. He Oh, big
time. And I'm so that's for real though.

2024
02:06:17,290 --> 02:06:20,770
Well you also said that
about their dark chocolate.

2025
02:06:21,170 --> 02:06:25,080
Well those are the most
comfortable for sure.

2026
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:29,700
And and well, let's show you
were, and I tried on Joggers,

2027
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:34,800
I told me about it. Yeah. Ridiculous.
Then the whole idea. So sounds ridiculous.

2028
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:40,230
You don't have a Jogger, uh, what do you
call physique? Yeah. What do you need to,

2029
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:41,990
what's the geography?
I like skinny.

2030
02:06:46,050 --> 02:06:51,050
I don't know that I can put my finger
on what exactly a geography is,

2031
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:56,010
but I can tell you that I don't, you don't
have it. Yes sir. I confirmed that. Yes.

2032
02:06:56,011 --> 02:06:58,770
So don't worry about the joggers. If
you're Jocko button. If for anyone else,

2033
02:06:58,771 --> 02:07:01,530
those joggers are factually
in the most comfortable.

2034
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:05,040
A jogger sweat situation close

2035
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:08,100
in exists currently.

2036
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:12,060
Currently they've got some
supplements to a joint warfare.

2037
02:07:12,090 --> 02:07:14,700
Krill oil discipline discipline.
Go.

2038
02:07:15,570 --> 02:07:18,030
We were on a Skype or a or a yeah,

2039
02:07:18,031 --> 02:07:22,830
this business Skype call today
and Jason Gardner was on and he,

2040
02:07:22,831 --> 02:07:24,420
you know,
you can you have a little video?

2041
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:29,840
My little video, I don't know which one.
Jake. No little video like Skype, Skype.

2042
02:07:29,841 --> 02:07:33,470
You know what Skype is? It's video
comp. Video teleconferencing. Yes.

2043
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:34,850
What you mean Jason Gardeners like,

2044
02:07:35,310 --> 02:07:40,280
like pulls out his bottle of discipline
going opens it up and like takes one in.

2045
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:43,720
Yo, Jason's super animated, you know,

2046
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:48,250
and he gets this big smile on his face
because he took a couple hits in the

2047
02:07:48,251 --> 02:07:52,600
discipline go anyways, so we got that.
Good. If you need to get in the zone.

2048
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:57,370
We also have milk, mint,
milk, peanut butter, milk,
vanilla, gorilla, the darkness,

2049
02:07:57,371 --> 02:08:02,170
chocolate and now live strawberry,

2050
02:08:03,190 --> 02:08:07,770
strawberry, slayer, moldy,
strawberry slayer. Oh boy. All right,

2051
02:08:08,030 --> 02:08:09,610
so let me tell you,

2052
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:15,310
get that strawberry is just straight up.
Get that strawberry.

2053
02:08:15,311 --> 02:08:18,280
That thing is a dessert.
Dang. Okay. So we like,

2054
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:22,540
I don't know how well
it's, it's the, the kids,

2055
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:24,970
the warrior could moke which
some strawberries. Awesome.

2056
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:27,070
The chocolate's good to strawberries.
Awesome.

2057
02:08:27,071 --> 02:08:29,500
The chocolate's good to strawberries.
Awesome.

2058
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:34,300
And I didn't think I just was telling
Bryan like, no, hey man, I don't care.

2059
02:08:34,301 --> 02:08:38,140
Just put a bigger scoop in and whatever.
Just re duplicated. But you know,

2060
02:08:38,141 --> 02:08:40,180
he's like, no, it's kind of more
protein. It's adults, blah blah blah.

2061
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:43,270
And somehow he made it.
It's actually,

2062
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:46,660
it's actually better or at least as good.

2063
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:51,910
It might be so good dude.
It's so good. It's ridiculous.

2064
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:56,050
It's a straight up desert.
It tastes like a milkshake straight up.

2065
02:08:56,051 --> 02:08:58,090
If you mix it with milk,
which is what I mix it with.

2066
02:08:58,240 --> 02:09:00,910
It tastes like a Straw Berry milkshake.

2067
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:05,710
It tastes better than a
strawberry milkshake. So if
he's so good, it's ridiculous.

2068
02:09:05,711 --> 02:09:09,610
You go blind taste tests, you've got all
the protein that you need. Here you go.

2069
02:09:09,611 --> 02:09:13,210
And then you have um, blind taste
test, right? You've got to imagine,

2070
02:09:13,211 --> 02:09:17,430
cause you know the difference. I get
it. So you have a, a cop, you know, war.

2071
02:09:17,431 --> 02:09:22,420
You could milk strawberry adult. We'll
just, we'll just say milk strawberry.

2072
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:27,910
Right. Which one are you going to
choose? Which one are you, you, you,

2073
02:09:27,911 --> 02:09:31,690
you, I think I'm going to
go for the adult. I thought
you were gonna throw a, uh,

2074
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:35,590
a Haagen daas strawberry shake.
And here's the deal.

2075
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:40,510
I'm not picking the Haagen. Daas is too
much. It's too much. It's too much. Yeah.

2076
02:09:40,511 --> 02:09:42,400
That's kind of why I didn't say it.
And it's not even,

2077
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:46,080
it's not even too much in a good way.
It's too much in a bad way. It's like,

2078
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:47,770
it's like you don't want to drink it.

2079
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:52,310
The strawberry Mulkey you're like
just pounding it. Yeah. Three. Her,

2080
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:56,260
she feeling good about things.
Interesting. All right, well
I'm gonna try it, Ellen,

2081
02:09:56,390 --> 02:09:58,500
because I have no,
actually, wait d I think he,

2082
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:02,170
he should have put some in the
mail. It just, it just came out.

2083
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:07,090
I have not tried it yet, but I will
report back 100% Jocko. White Tea as well.

2084
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:10,510
Yes. Don't forget about that. Yeah.
It'll get you 20,000 pound dead lift,

2085
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:13,210
which is no big deal to some people.
To me, it's kind of a big deal.

2086
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,250
And this organic by the way.
So you know,

2087
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:21,150
percent organic certified check also.

2088
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:25,120
Yes, we have a store. Jocko has a store.

2089
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:29,590
So I made a video is fun about, it was
nothing like super in depth, but you know,

2090
02:10:29,591 --> 02:10:34,591

are people call you got Noah Noah

2091

Yeah, he's actually been like,

2092
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,500
I mean on top of Greg Macintyre.
He,

2093
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:46,580
he's been kind of my main training partner
recently. The past few months. Yeah.

2094
02:10:46,581 --> 02:10:51,170
The main one. Yeah. So him.
Yes. No Oliver. Greg Mcintyre.

Greg tray is in there.

2098
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:08,610
He's all up in there. Yeah. Oh, you
got Dave Burke. Good deal. Good deal.

2099
02:11:08,611 --> 02:11:12,750
Days in there. Jamie's in there.
Jamie. Yeah. Um, and then the kids.

2100
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:17,400
Can we say whose kids there?
There's some kids in there.

2101
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:19,860
We'll just say there's some
kids in there. Yes, they're not.

2102
02:11:19,861 --> 02:11:22,890
My kids are not echo kids, but they
don't make kids do their warrior kids.

2103
02:11:22,891 --> 02:11:26,570
We know. What, don't worry kids a
hundred thousand percent. Yeah. So yeah,

2104
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:30,300
the deans in their teams there anyway,
the point is they're just our friend.

2105
02:11:30,301 --> 02:11:33,430
He was just this cool, fun video
Jocko story. You want to do,

2106
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:36,630
you want something get or if you like
something to get something nonetheless

2107
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:40,140
Jocko, store.com this is where you can
get the shirts that say discipline equals

2108
02:11:40,141 --> 02:11:45,060
freedom if you want to represent
in the wild on the path.

2109
02:11:45,061 --> 02:11:48,480
How is this? When I was um,
this was a while ago, so my, my,

2110
02:11:48,481 --> 02:11:51,090
I had an extra shirt later on.

2111
02:11:51,090 --> 02:11:54,520
It was a size medium
for the that you wear.

2112
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,390
See what's funny is I need,
you can say that,

2113
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:00,840
I know you're going to say Sunday that
anyway, I'm taking pictures for this.

2114
02:12:00,841 --> 02:12:01,031
You know,

2115
02:12:01,031 --> 02:12:05,010
you've got to take pictures for the
products for the store and for whatever

2116
02:12:05,011 --> 02:12:09,420
reason, the size medium, that's the
best looking size I guess for pictures.

2117
02:12:09,421 --> 02:12:12,210
I Dunno nonetheless take the picture of
him, but I have it laying around, right?

2118
02:12:12,211 --> 02:12:15,300
So my wife is like,
oh this is extra shirt and you know,

2119
02:12:15,301 --> 02:12:18,780
can I give it to like one of my
friends or whatever and I wasn't,

2120
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:20,700
I had no use for the shirt at this point.

2121
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:26,160
And I said no because I don't know if
their friend is like going to represent,

2122
02:12:26,161 --> 02:12:28,110
you know,
I don't know if the friend is on the path.

2123
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:31,050
What if the friend's not on the path
and they're wearing that shirt that's,

2124
02:12:31,051 --> 02:12:33,700
you know, it's different. There's
more to it. That's what it feels like.

2125
02:12:33,701 --> 02:12:36,520
You see what I'm saying?
It's true story nonetheless.

2126
02:12:37,770 --> 02:12:41,220
When you are on the path and you
want to represent in the wild,

2127
02:12:41,221 --> 02:12:45,480
you just go to Jocko store.com
I was at the Joe Rogan show.

2128
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:50,250
Sure. The four 24 20 and San
Diego with Peter Attia. Yeah.

2129
02:12:50,730 --> 02:12:55,730
And we were with a bunch of other dudes
and Peter was reminding me that on

2130
02:12:57,451 --> 02:13:01,950
Twitter somebody had said,
hey Jocko,

2131
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:07,580
I wasn't in the seal teams but I
want to show support to the seals.

2132
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:13,080
Is it cool if I were like a navy seal?

2133
02:13:13,081 --> 02:13:16,170
Trident on my hat for tee shirt.

2134
02:13:17,610 --> 02:13:19,410
And my response was,

2135
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:25,790
I was in the seal teams for 20 years
and I don't wear a seal team hat or tee

2136
02:13:26,110 --> 02:13:30,850
shirt. Wait, so does that
mean yes or no? That means no.

2137
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:32,550
Hell No. Right? Because, okay,

2138
02:13:32,551 --> 02:13:37,200
so coincidentally me and good deal,
Dave Burke,

2139
02:13:37,201 --> 02:13:38,610
we're talking about the exact same thing.

2140
02:13:38,611 --> 02:13:42,270
So I forget how we ended up talking about
it, but I was like, Hey, what's the,

2141
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:44,790
what's the,
cause he gave me his uniform,

2142
02:13:44,791 --> 02:13:47,910
I was doing something with it
for video wise. So I don't know,

2143
02:13:47,911 --> 02:13:51,480
for whatever reason we ended up talking
about what like what can, you were like,

2144
02:13:51,481 --> 02:13:55,740
what can not wear, what's off limits on
this thing? And he told me it was like,

2145
02:13:55,741 --> 02:13:58,560
you know,
some stuff in me but I don't know.

2146
02:13:58,590 --> 02:14:01,920
So he had to sort of explain it to me
and that's essentially the scenario he

2147
02:14:01,921 --> 02:14:04,800
painted. He was like, you
know how like the navy seals,
like they have the trident.

2148
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:07,510
Like you can't just put on
a train it, you know, like,

2149
02:14:07,770 --> 02:14:10,320
like if you're not that you bring the,
tried it here,

2150
02:14:10,321 --> 02:14:11,760
but let's say for
whatever reason you read,

2151
02:14:11,761 --> 02:14:15,960
I can't just grab it and then like kind
of put it on even as like for fun. No,

2152
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:18,270
it's like Beth that's kind of off
limits, you know, you can't say.

2153
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:21,390
And then so you made the
comparison to Jujitsu belt too.

2154
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:24,240
Like if I grabbed your
black belt and put it on,

2155
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:30,440
granted you're kind of my
friend. I could never, let's say,

2156
02:14:30,450 --> 02:14:32,850
let's say I wasn't listening, I
wasn't even a white belt. Let's say.

2157
02:14:32,851 --> 02:14:37,110
I was like even like a purple belt and
my instructor who I wasn't necessarily

2158
02:14:37,111 --> 02:14:39,480
personal friends with, but that
was happening to be my instructor.

2159
02:14:39,481 --> 02:14:40,560
I can't put that belt on.

2160
02:14:40,630 --> 02:14:42,400
What if you use it?
What if you forgot your belt?

2161
02:14:42,430 --> 02:14:45,970
He was injured and he was on the sidelines
and he's like, oh, just wear mine.

2162
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:47,133
Would you wear it?

2163
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:51,850
Never do that. But what's funny is Dave
Burke brought that exact scenario up.

2164
02:14:51,851 --> 02:14:54,820
Different colors though. So he got good
question. When someone was like, Hey,

2165
02:14:54,821 --> 02:14:58,190
just where mine, it's a blue
belt. He said he's in, uh,

2166
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:59,380
the guy he was training with,

2167
02:14:59,390 --> 02:15:02,410
I think it was a blue belt that he
was training with. He was like, Hey,

2168
02:15:02,411 --> 02:15:05,610
I have an extra one. You don't have a
belt, you need a belt to to, you know,

2169
02:15:05,630 --> 02:15:07,510
the train and stuff like that.
Gives him his blue belt.

2170
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:11,680
Dave Burke said out of respect for
the guys, like, you know, suggestion,

2171
02:15:11,681 --> 02:15:14,600
he wore it but he did not feel
good about it at all. And I think,

2172
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:17,830
I think that's kind of the
deal where if some higher belts

2173
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:20,500
I used to give guys,
like in the,

2174
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:25,420
if they started trading I'd give them
a piece of one inch, two tubular.

2175
02:15:25,421 --> 02:15:28,450
Nylon Green. Yeah. Which is
just like to tie their belt.

2176
02:15:28,510 --> 02:15:32,930
Do you remember any Cameron using
ABC. Okay. Right. Okay. Yeah.

2177
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:37,540
Camp Good Jiu Jitsu by the way,
the wrestler and strong wrong. Yes.

2178
02:15:37,590 --> 02:15:39,420
So he came to mind is the guy that,
you know,

2179
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:41,300
Cameron came to my house and
tamed the beast. You know the,

2180
02:15:41,301 --> 02:15:43,630
you know what that is with
Kettlebell tame the beast.

2181
02:15:43,631 --> 02:15:47,960
You get the 48 kilogram Kettlebell, which
you don't have one that big? Yes I do.

2182
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:53,350
I'll have a nice, so I have
one, but before I had those,

2183
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:57,970
he ordered one and he was like in
between houses at the time. So he,

2184
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:01,510
so he ordered a, had it sent
to my house. He gets it.

2185
02:16:01,930 --> 02:16:06,700
He comes to my house first time he's
ever picked up a 48 kilogram hundred and

2186
02:16:06,701 --> 02:16:10,300
six pound kettle bell. And there's
a thing called taming the beast,

2187
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:15,390
which is you do a press
with that kettle bell,

2188
02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:21,330
you do a pistol with that kettle bell and
then you do a pull up with that kettle

2189
02:16:22,151 --> 02:16:25,180
bell. And the first time
he ever did it, he did it.

2190
02:16:25,181 --> 02:16:29,110
He did it right in front of them. Did
it all right. Like no warmup. Just,

2191
02:16:29,410 --> 02:16:30,010
just did it.

2192
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,450
Yeah. And that's quite a lot cause he's
not a large get like I'm bigger than him.

2193
02:16:33,470 --> 02:16:36,850
He's like what?
[inaudible] 95 yeah,

2194
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:41,430
maybe one nine. Yeah, I, yeah, I might
give him like one nonetheless. Yeah,

2195
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:43,680
that's saying a lot.
No,

2196
02:16:43,690 --> 02:16:47,290
that's the point I bring him up is because
the first time he ever trained Geek

2197
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:49,090
because I trained with
them before and I was like,

2198
02:16:49,091 --> 02:16:52,810
oh this guy's probably at the time,
this was years ago, I was like,

2199
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:55,120
you was probably, I was a
purple belt. So I was like,

2200
02:16:55,121 --> 02:16:58,520
this guy is probably like a purple
belt too. So you know, whatever.

2201
02:16:58,521 --> 02:17:02,140
I trained with him one day he comes
in in the Geek, so I'm like, Oh shit.

2202
02:17:02,141 --> 02:17:05,150
You know that little parties like
kind of like, oh yeah, like you know,

2203
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:06,780
let me confirm.
We don't want to,

2204
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:10,990
but he has a piece of
that green that Darlene,

2205
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:14,381
and here's the thing,

2206
02:17:14,381 --> 02:17:17,740
he doesn't just stand out because
it's like it's Kinda dark or whatever.

2207
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:19,690
But you see new guy come,
you know, cause he's Sorta,

2208
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:22,820
you know how when you come and train for
the first time and g and some classes,

2209
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:25,780
kind of like most of those people, they
kind of [inaudible]. Exactly right.

2210
02:17:25,781 --> 02:17:28,390
But this guy is a new guy. I knew who he
was. So I was like looking at, I'm like,

2211
02:17:28,391 --> 02:17:32,020
okay, that's obviously a military
piece of equipment. It's not a belt.

2212
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:35,000
It was funny, the looks on
everyone's face, they'll like this,

2213
02:17:35,001 --> 02:17:39,790
like you're kind of looking at each other
as the whole world gone crazy.

2214
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:44,860
It's really funny. But that's how
rigid the belt situation is though.

2215
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:49,090
That's why you can't just grab a
guy's belt. And as I know people,

2216
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:52,910
not specific people, but it would
stand to reason, put it that way.

2217
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:57,250
It would stand to reason that even as
a joke, if I grabbed like, you know,

2218
02:17:57,251 --> 02:18:01,150
it's funny as a joke, I've been like
here just where mine, like some people,

2219
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:04,360
you know, I've just been like giving
people my black belt. Like, Oh, you know,

2220
02:18:04,361 --> 02:18:06,670
like a, like a blue belt or a
boy here, you just were mine.

2221
02:18:06,671 --> 02:18:10,900
And that give it to me like, like
awkwardly awkwardly, make them do it.

2222
02:18:12,730 --> 02:18:17,520
That's how the dynamics of that, you know,
before I really knew Jeff Glover, yeah,

2223
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:20,920
he came down here and did a seminar and
he's like, Hey, I don't have a belt.

2224
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:23,770
And I was like, yeah, you can use mine.
And I was really, I was actually worried.

2225
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:28,480
Yeah, we had one belt. I've
only had one belt my whole time,

2226
02:18:28,481 --> 02:18:31,960
like one black belt and I was
worried. I was like, Dang. I mean,

2227
02:18:31,961 --> 02:18:34,660
not that I thought he was going to
like steal it, but I just was afraid.

2228
02:18:34,661 --> 02:18:36,880
Oh you know,
you know he'll,

2229
02:18:36,881 --> 02:18:39,340
he'll put in his bag and next thing you
know it's in Santa Barbara and the next

2230
02:18:39,341 --> 02:18:42,490
thing you know, I'll never see my
belt again. My special belt. Yeah.

2231
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:45,910
I was there for that day when he did
it because we wasn't here though.

2232
02:18:45,911 --> 02:18:48,740
I wasn't here. That was more, I like
what's here and I had to go. Yeah.

2233
02:18:48,910 --> 02:18:52,780
And so I didn't get to,
but he hung it back up.

2234
02:18:52,781 --> 02:18:55,990
Jeffy Glover took care of it.
I took a picture of him that day.

2235
02:18:56,050 --> 02:18:58,090
Oh really rough to see
if he was where my belt,

2236
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:01,390
he is wearing your belt and the picture
and he's doing this and that picture

2237
02:19:01,391 --> 02:19:05,110
ended up being used for a bunch of
different stuff. That's kind of cool.

2238
02:19:05,111 --> 02:19:07,200
Then my belt made it
kind of famous with Jeff.

2239
02:19:07,201 --> 02:19:10,480
He if you notice like the belt is a
little bit long. It's fun. Oh yeah.

2240
02:19:10,481 --> 02:19:11,920
Cause I'm thicker than he is.

2241
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:14,980
Yeah we'll you have like a what you
know the belt comes with three. Yeah.

2242
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:18,940
And he's probably, he's Ne one for sure
cause you have 55 yup. There it is.

2243
02:19:18,941 --> 02:19:20,470
So don't do that.
Don't

2244
02:19:21,970 --> 02:19:26,970
seal team two who is just an incredibly
well respected guy in the day he had,

2245
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:34,070
I think he had two sons and he was
giving them like a, like a hat,

2246
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:35,840
like a seal team,

2247
02:19:35,841 --> 02:19:39,650
two hat or something that had to try done
on it or he had an old one that he was

2248
02:19:39,651 --> 02:19:41,750
going to giving to his son's like hey
I'm not going to wear this and it's too

2249
02:19:41,751 --> 02:19:45,890
old. And he made them cut the Triton
off of it. If they wanted to wear it.

2250
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,380
I was like yes I dig it. And there's
all those kinds of things, you know,

2251
02:19:51,381 --> 02:19:54,490
like if even on a super
lower level, like, you know,

2252
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:58,100
if you made it through some little thing,
like I don't know,

2253
02:19:58,101 --> 02:20:01,640
like one of these spartan
races or something that you
only get this shirt or hat

2254
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:05,840
if you did it, you know. And even
then there's a little, I mean it's,

2255
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:08,360
it's way more loose for sure.
But you know,

2256
02:20:08,390 --> 02:20:11,140
like your wife puts it on or
something and you're like,

2257
02:20:11,141 --> 02:20:13,940
people like don't do that. That,
yeah, man. I know my daughter,

2258
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,530
I know my daughter present in that state.
A state wrestling championships.

2259
02:20:18,970 --> 02:20:21,860
Those kids up there, they're buying
those shirts and sweatshirts.

2260
02:20:21,861 --> 02:20:25,610
I got to read about what if you came home
and your wife had, you're trading on,

2261
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,850
why would my wife had lunches because
she's trying to represent, well,

2262
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:32,810
I'll just take it from her.
No,

2263
02:20:32,811 --> 02:20:36,680
actually there's a thing where there's
a thing where like a seal will give his

2264
02:20:36,681 --> 02:20:39,950
wife like a little necklace when
I tried it on it. Okay. You know,

2265
02:20:39,951 --> 02:20:43,280
that's sort of their why. So she
doesn't take his going to be, no,

2266
02:20:43,281 --> 02:20:46,250
I don't think she'd be trying to take
his, but I think it's just, you know,

2267
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:49,010
little appreciation. Yeah,
fully. But no, but no,

2268
02:20:49,130 --> 02:20:53,850
my wife knows what's up. You know?
My wife does not one of those. Yeah,

2269
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:57,290
I know she doesn't make sense. So
that's kind of how it is. Right.

2270
02:20:57,291 --> 02:21:01,970
When the shirts from Jocko store
kind of, I mean, not to that level,

2271
02:21:02,060 --> 02:21:06,860
but I put it this way.
If I see someone wearing representing,

2272
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:09,440
I know that they're representing,
I know they're on the pathway.

2273
02:21:09,830 --> 02:21:14,240
They're not just some guy who person
or whatever. That's not in the past.

2274
02:21:14,241 --> 02:21:18,760
It doesn't seem like that.
Oh, they're definitely in the
game. Yeah, for sure. Yeah,

2275
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:22,100
they're definitely in the game. That's
what it feels like. Well, there you go.

2276
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:25,940
Also subscribe to the podcast
if you haven't already. I know.

2277
02:21:25,941 --> 02:21:27,380
Seems obvious,

2278
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:31,650
but apparently it's not as obvious
from what I gather. Nonetheless,

2279
02:21:31,730 --> 02:21:35,710
subscribe if you haven't already, and
by the way, if you get a piece of gear,

2280
02:21:35,711 --> 02:21:40,400
it supports the podcast. Is that
important? We'll, is it important?

2281
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:43,890
Depends on what you mean
by important. So yes. Yeah.

2282
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I mean it's important to let people
know that the one additional bonus of

2283
02:21:49,881 --> 02:21:54,440
representing is you're actually
helping out the podcast support.

2284
02:21:54,441 --> 02:21:58,370
We're going to get a new table by the
way, which has been a 100 yeah, this one.

2285
02:21:58,371 --> 02:22:02,120
It wiggles a lot. It's
ridiculous. Echo Charles is table.

2286
02:22:02,580 --> 02:22:06,950
This is one of those things where like
an apt punishment would be you had to

2287
02:22:06,951 --> 02:22:10,070
bring this to your house and use it
as your dining room table for a year.

2288
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:14,960
Oh my gosh. No. Yeah, yeah.
This is a good day. Why?

2289
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:19,040
You know the picture looked
nice. Check. All right,

2290
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:21,110
so we're going to get a new table.
If you buy a tee shirt,

2291
02:22:21,111 --> 02:22:24,500
we can get a new table that's not
going to fall down and all that.

2292
02:22:24,501 --> 02:22:27,480
But we appreciate that support too.

clock with my voice on it,

2312
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:38,370
telling them to wake up or whatever.
That's good.

art on canvases and vinyl

up and you can remind yourself
the discipline equals freedom.

2322
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:15,710
You can remind yourself that
all your excuses are lies. Yeah.

2323
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:18,120
Well that, that's really good

and we have posters for sure on you know
the store, but this is a little bit,

2325
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:24,960
it's like one to maybe like
three or four levels better way.

2326
02:24:25,060 --> 02:24:27,450
Then you know a poster.
The poster is buzzer.

2327
02:24:27,490 --> 02:24:31,140
Qubit like of course you hate me to

religiously taking this shroom tech immune

2340
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:22,320
check. You got to take Talon

2343
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:29,760
On [inaudible] dot com slash jock have
a little book coming out called way of

2344
02:25:30,441 --> 02:25:32,890
the warrior kid three
where there's a will.

2345
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:35,740
It is available for preorder right now.

2346
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:39,010

and you want the book,

2347
02:25:39,011 --> 02:25:41,500
please preorder it so that
I know how many to print.

2348
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:45,910
I failed miserably when it came to Mikey
and the dragons, Mike and the dragons.

2349
02:25:45,911 --> 02:25:50,830
I didn't make enough. I ended up having
a scramble to make more. I apologize.

2350
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:55,420
We got them to everyone by Christmas,
but it was uh, it was not smooth.

2351
02:25:55,870 --> 02:26:00,250
It was a little bit of a nightmare.
So total failure on my part this time way,

2352
02:26:00,251 --> 02:26:04,240
the warrior kid three where
there's a will check out that book,

Now it's coming out May 28th by the way.

2354
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:13,390
So we're almost there,

2355
02:26:14,380 --> 02:26:17,920
quickly enough to have them ready
for you if you preordered. Anyways,

2356
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:20,170
also they way the warrior
kid and Mark's mission,

2357
02:26:20,290 --> 02:26:22,630
those are the first two books in
that series. Mike in the dragons.

2358
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:26,200
Best book ever for little
kids in the history of ever.

2359
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:30,370
That's confirmed by the way.
And the field manual,

2360
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,840
the discipline equals
freedom field manual.

2361
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:38,410
That's a book about how to get after it,
no matter where you are in your life.

2362
02:26:38,650 --> 02:26:40,690
It's a great place to start boarding,

2363
02:26:40,691 --> 02:26:43,330
keep you up to start on the
path or to keep you on the path.

2364
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:48,490
The audio version of that is on
iTunes, Amazon music, Google play,

2365
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:51,610
extreme ownership. First Book I
wrote with my brother Leif Babin,

2366
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:54,730
the dichotomy of leadership.
His second book I wrote with my brother,

2367
02:26:54,731 --> 02:26:58,450
late Babin Ashkelon front.
That's our leadership consultancy.

2368
02:26:58,780 --> 02:27:02,260
We solve problems through leadership.
That's what we do.

2369
02:27:02,261 --> 02:27:07,261
Go to echelon front.com the
muster May 23rd and 24th sold out,

2370
02:27:08,201 --> 02:27:11,590
done.
That's in Chicago,

2371
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:15,550
September 19th and 20th in Denver. That
one is going to sell out, so is Sydney,

2372
02:27:15,551 --> 02:27:20,230
December 4th and fifth if you want to
come to the monster extreme ownership.com

2373
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:23,140
that's where the details are.
They're all going to sell out.

2374
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:26,650
All of them have sold out and all of them
will sell out, so if you want to come

2375
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:31,780
get on there and get registered,
eff online already talked about that.

2376
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:36,700
The F Overwatch is where we take
leaders from special operations,

2377
02:27:36,701 --> 02:27:37,720
from combat aviation,

2378
02:27:37,721 --> 02:27:41,800
and we placed them into companies that
need leadership inside their organization.

2379
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:46,720
So you don't always want to hire someone
just because they've been working in

2380
02:27:46,721 --> 02:27:48,040
some industry for a long time.

2381
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:52,030
Hire someone that has
leadership capability and then
get them up to speed on the

2382
02:27:52,031 --> 02:27:54,400
industry.
These guys are proven combat leaders.

2383
02:27:54,401 --> 02:27:57,430
They can step up and take
you to the place you need.

2384
02:27:57,580 --> 02:27:59,800
Efo overwatch.com and

2385
02:28:01,430 --> 02:28:05,410
be on a cruise with us hardcore
by the way, a hardcore cruising,

2386
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:10,300
which is my recommended level of cruising
from time to time rest between sets

2387
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:13,120
were on the interwebs,
Twitter,

2388
02:28:13,180 --> 02:28:17,940
Instagram and on Facebook that I was
going to do it like you didn't do.

2389
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:19,000
Anyway.

02:28:47,151 --> 02:28:52,151
365 days a year to keep us safe here
at home and to everyone else out there

2397
02:28:55,230 --> 02:29:00,230
remembers some of those lessons
from Field Marshall Montgomery.

2398
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:02,280
Okay.

2399
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:07,280
Remember to cut through the overlying
difficulties and see the essential,

2400
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:14,950
well, what you need to do and
then take a dispatching it,

2401
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:20,100
a dispassionate view of good things and
bad things that are going to assail you.

2402
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:22,830
Yeah.

2403
02:29:22,830 --> 02:29:27,830
And use your force of will
to keep getting after it.

2404
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:31,890
And until next time,

2405
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:36,280
this is echo and Jocko out.
