This is Jocko podcast number
one 30 with Echo Charles and me,

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,590
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good Evening

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,160
Caesar.
When he perceived that the seventh legion,

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,760
which stood close by him was
also hard pressed by the enemy,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,140
directed the tribunes of the soldiers
to affect a junction of the legions

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:27,141
gradually and make their charge upon the
enemy with a double front which having

7
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:29,010
been done since.

8
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:34,011
They brought assistance to the one to
the other nor feared lest their rear

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,210
should be surrounded by the enemy.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,960
They began to stand their ground more
boldly and to fight more courageously.

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,780
In the meantime,

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,940
the soldiers of the two legions which
had been in the rear of the army as a

13
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:54,941
guard for the baggage train upon the
battle being reported to them quick and

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,270
their pace,

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,630
and we're seen by the enemy on top
of the hill and Titus having gained

16
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:06,170
possession of the camp of the enemy and
observed from higher ground what was

17
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:07,460
going on in our camp,

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,820
sent the 10th Legion as a relief to our
men who when they had learned from the

19
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:19,391
flight of the horses and the settlers in
what position the affair was and in how

20
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:24,680
great danger that camp and the Legion
and the commander were involved,

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,430
left undone,
nothing to dispatch,

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,570
okay.

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,970
By their arrival.
So great.

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,330
A change of matters was made that our men,

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,010
even those who had fallen down,
exhausted with wounds,

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,670
leaned on their shields
and renewed the fight.

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,110
Then the camp retainers though unarmed,

28
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,340
seeing the enemy completely dismayed,
attacked them,

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,270
though they were armed.
The horseman too,

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,420
that they might buy their valor blocks
the disgrace of their flight thrust

31
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:07,440
themselves before the legionaries
soldiers in all parts of the battle.

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,463
But the enemy,

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,030
even in the last hope of safety displayed
such great courage that when the

34
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:20,800
foremost most of them had fallen,

35
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,660
the next stood upon those who were
prostrate and fought from on top of their

36
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:33,481
bodies when these were overthrown
and their corpses heaped up together,

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,250
those who survived cast their weapons
against our men as from a mound and

38
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,280
returned our dark wood,

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,480
which had fallen short between our armies
so that it ought not to be concluded

40
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,550
that men have such great courage,

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,560
had in judiciously dared
to pass a very broad river,

42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,160
ascend very high banks and come to a
very disadvantageous place since their

43
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:07,171
greatness of spirit had
rendered these actions easy,

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,340
although in themselves very difficult.

45
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,693
Yeah,

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,313
so

47
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,060
war is eternal

48
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,960
and some things do not change.

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,910
And in war we see the
brutal examples of savagery

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,700
and we also see the courage
and sacrifice that's

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,190
hard to find anywhere else.
Like in that passage right there,

52
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
unarmed men attacking the enemy
and even the enemy showing courage,

53
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,980
climbing on top of stacked bodies of their
brethren to gain a little bit of high

54
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,874
ground.

55
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,271
Think about that.

56
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:10,271
Gaining the high ground by climbing
on the backs of your fallen comrades?

57
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,053
No,

58
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,400
that is war and that account
of war is from the book,

59
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,100
the Gallic wars,
which was written

60
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,580
by Julius Caesar himself, although he
refers to himself in the third person

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,210
and that war lasted from around 58 BC,

62
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,220
two 50 B c eight years of fighting between
the Gauls who were a Celtic race of

63
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:47,850
people in what is now France and Belgium,

64
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,770
I guess you'd say Celtic

65
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,230
and of course the Romans were known
for their military strength and in the

66
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:58,674
future,

67
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,890
I'm sure we'll go a little bit
deeper into some of Caesar's writing,

68
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,180
but today we're going to look
more at an overall assessment

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,540
and instruction really about
the Road Roman legions,

70
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,330
which as I said,

71
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:23,331
are known as an incredibly
powerful military fighting
force that conquered much

72
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:30,201
of Europe and parts of Africa
and the Middle East over time.

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,500
And the writing that we're looking at
today comes from a guy by the name of the

74
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,843
giddiness.

75
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,830
Now his full name was poo bleus,

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,180
Flavia's vagarious Renata's.

77
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,710
But thankfully we can just refer to him
as the Getty is not much is known about

78
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,810
them.
It's actually not even known.

79
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,530
100% if forgets.
This was actually in the military,

80
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,090
it, it seems as if he
was, and even if he was,

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,120
it's likely that he didn't have any
great stature or rank inside the Roman

82
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,414
military.

83
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,920
But he did capture some
incredibly important information

84
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,650
and he called it the Apidra,

85
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,500
more ray Miller terrorists,
which translate,

86
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,590
it's basically into the
epitome of the art of war.

87
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,880
Sometimes it's also
called de re militaria,

88
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,570
which means on matters of the military.

89
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,190
And the book is estimated to have been
written around four 30 a d so it's

90
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,170
several hundred years after Caesar's rain.

91
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,430
But this book that he wrote became a
guide for warfare throughout the Middle

92
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,120
Ages. And, and
interestingly, this is even,

93
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,180
it stayed even after we had gun powder
and it was carried oftentimes by general

94
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,720
officers and their
staff throughout Europe.

95
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:16,721
And there are even reports that George
Washington carried an annotated copy with

96
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:22,400
him, which as I dug into it may or may
not be completely true, but at a minimum,

97
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,373
at a minimum,

98
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,830
he paraphrased Vegetti yeses book in his
first address to Congress in 1790 when

99
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,690
he said to be prepared for war

100
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,580
is one of the most effectual
means of preserving peace.

101
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,450
So brigetta has put this information
together through at a minimum keen

102
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:54,241
observation of how the Roman legions
and the Roman military worked.

103
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,930
And the book has stood the test of time.

104
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,460
So I think we might as well see
what we can get out of it. Yes sir.

105
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,300
What do you think? Yes
sir. [inaudible] check.

106
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,740
It starts off strong.
We'll say that

107
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,680
starts off right here.

108
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,030
Victory in war does not depend
entirely upon numbers or mere courage.

109
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,660
Only skill and discipline will insure it.

110
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,510
Okay.

111
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,440
That's a common theme.

112
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,330
We find that the Romans owed the conquest
of the world to know other cause then

113
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:38,500
their continual military training,

114
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,770
exact observance of discipline in their
camps and unmarried cultivation of other

115
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,450
arts of war.

116
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,351
Does this mean?

117
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:53,680
I'm just gonna be talking about discipline
for the next as long as I'm alive.

118
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,850
Yes. It's entirely
possible, isn't it? Yeah.

119
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,530
It's interesting that he says it's,

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,680
it's important than just mere more
important than just mere courage.

121
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,720
Courage is important, but there's
something more important. Discipline. Yes.

122
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,290
And skill and scale. Scale it where
you liked that part. Yes. Okay.

123
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,170
Romans.
Okay.

124
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,890
They thoroughly understood the
importance of hardening them.

125
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,440
So when he's talking about what the
Romans do, talking about the Romans,

126
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,920
that's the day they thoroughly understood
the importance of hardening them by

127
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:30,690
continual practice and of training them
to every maneuver that might happen in

128
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,310
the line and an action.

129
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Nor were they less strict in
punishing idleness and Slough.

130
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,150
See,

131
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,030
sometimes I stick up for like our
generation or being modern saying like,

132
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,780
no, you know, we're, we're
kind of hardcore too.

133
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,790
But then I read stuff like that and
I kind of wonder, I kind of wonder,

134
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,660
the courage of a soldier is heightened
by his knowledge of his profession and he

135
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,840
only wants an opportunity
to execute what is,

136
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,350
he is convinced he has been perfectly
taught, so that makes sense.

137
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,280
I did an interview a little while ago
and as I'm, it hasn't come out yet,

138
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,090
it was with NPR, NPR,
national public radio,

139
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,370
but he was asking me,

140
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,650
he had heard me saying that an interview
that like I wanted to go to war and he

141
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:26,610
was kind of surprised about that. But
that's exactly what this is talking about.

142
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,530
You train and you're convinced that you've
been taught well and then you want to

143
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:36,050
go get after it. Especially
when you're young, you,

144
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,220
you have nothing to lose.
Back to the book,

145
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,810
a handful of men in nerd toward
proceed to certain victory.

146
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,080
While on the contrary,
numerous armies of raw,

147
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:54,081
an undisciplined troops are but multitudes
of men dragged to the slaughter.

148
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,820
No big deal. Yeah. Multitudes
of undisciplined men.

149
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,840
You're just getting dragged to the
slaughter. That's life. That's life.

150
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:09,931
Oh,

151
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:14,760
and here's another point for it is
certain that the lesson man is acquainted

152
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:19,560
with the sweets of life. The less
reason he has to be afraid of death.

153
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,213
Interesting.

154
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,250
The young soldier therefore
ought to have a lively I. Oh,

155
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,790
this is he just talking about
what,

156
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,650
what the young recruits should be like,

157
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,690
what kind of qualities
they're supposed to have.

158
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,440
The young soldier therefore ought to
have a lively, I should carry his head,

159
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:40,140
erect his chest and shoulders be broad,

160
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,350
his shoulders muscular and
brawny his fingers long.

161
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,260
His Armstrong and his waist small.

162
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,820
Going back to posture. Remember I brought
that up with Jordan B. Peterson? Yes.

163
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,650
He's got the in his book.

164
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,300
Stand up straight with your
shoulders back and I'm like,

165
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,250
that's how you get
indoctrinated in the military.

166
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,270
That's been going on since the Roman
times. There's something to it.

167
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,690
I'm here to tell you,
talking more about the recruits.

168
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,770
He says they should be taught the use
of their arms by constant and daily

169
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:09,610
exercise.

170
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,410
But this essential costume has long been
abolished by the relaxation introduced

171
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,670
by a long piece.

172
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,470
Can't accept that when things
get easy. And you know, again,

173
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,920
working with businesses all the time,
it's,

174
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,990
it's real easy when the times are good,

175
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,260
like the economy's good right
now. The economy's good, right?

176
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,920
So people are just kind of
making money and everything good.

177
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,010
And then we'll train as hard. They don't
prepare as much happens in everything.

178
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,400
Yeah.
Because we kind of subconscious will,

179
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,730
it seems like you need any with sub
constantly rely on that kind of push.

180
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,300
Like the, you know, the stress
will push you, you know,

181
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,910
like if the economy is not good, it's
like, oh, it kind of pushes you to like,

182
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,230
oh we've got to, sure we don't work or
whatever. And it kind of, okay. Do you,

183
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,730
you know, some people, I
think you actually do this,

184
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,480
some people perform better under pressure.
Yeah.

185
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,830
The reason I say you because you'll,
you'll have a video to make let's say,

186
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,580
and if there is no deadline,
let's just say there's no real,

187
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,180
there's no real urgency.
Urgency. Like I'm not, I'm not,

188
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:14,380
I'm not expecting to see that.

189
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,340
But then sometimes there's a deadline
like for a muster video. Yeah. And,

190
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,720
and there comes the deadline and boom,
there's the video midnight,

191
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,100
one o'clock in the morning into
my email. Yeah, you need that.

192
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,430
You need that structure and discipline
younger. It does help for sure.

193
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,010
100% yeah. Even even time
stuff, like if you're like, hey,

194
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,970
meet me at around seven. Well
that's not correct. Yeah.

195
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,540
Well it'll be more, it'll be around
whatever time you might as well.

196
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,480
I said show up when you want.

197
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,530
I rolled the dice a little bit today cause
I said 1230 ish. Did you notice that?

198
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:53,380
Yes. To me when you put a number that I
just assumed that's the norm. That's how.

199
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,710
Yeah, that's probably good. Yeah, you're
right. I think you're right. You're right.

200
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,280
I think, yeah, you do. You do pretty good
with being on time for me actually. Yeah.

201
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,660
Yeah. Well I'm gonna say your bat
and I'm pretty good average. Yeah,

202
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,180
sure. Did you see someone asked how
they could get your job? Yes. Yeah.

203
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,650
Yeah. I told him to kill me and
kill you. Yeah. There you go.

204
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,150
I guess we know the price on your head.
Someone else.

205
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:26,500
Maybe they can be on time
because really that's all it required.

206
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,260
Press record beyond time ago.
We'll money

207
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,520
right now. He's talking a little
bit about initial training.

208
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,480
Going back to the book,

209
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,670
the first thing the soldiers are
to be taught in the military step,

210
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,840
which can only be acquired by constant
practice of marching quick and together,

211
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,140
nor is anything of more consequence either
on the march or in the line than they

212
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:54,320
should keep their ranks with the greatest
exactness for troops who march an

213
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,000
irregular and disorderly manner are
always in great danger of being defeated.

214
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,840
And I read that part so
I could read this part.

215
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,300
They should march with
the common military step,

216
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:09,740
20 miles in five summer hours and
with full step, which is quicker,

217
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,900
24 miles in the same number of hours.
So these guys can march,

218
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,030
you guys can march and we've talked
a lot about foot patrols and in the,

219
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,630
it's in the seal teams,
there's something called a forced march,

220
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,060
which is like you're on a road,
there's no threat,

221
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,510
you're just marching and you're trying
to move from point a to point B.

222
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,130
Don't do a lot of that in the seal teams.

223
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,800
You don't even do that really much
in the, well, I can't say that,

224
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,410
but there's a difference.
That's a forced march.

225
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,850
We called it a forest road march and then
there's patrolling where your tactical

226
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,980
and you're scanning your field to fire.

227
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,490
These guys are talking about a forest
road march and you're just on the road.

228
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:48,650
It's basically,
or you're going as fast as you can,

229
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,760
so you're just like maybe what, you don't
have a ride if, I mean in your case,

230
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,030
yeah, we'll never ride
for whatever reason. Well,

231
00:15:56,031 --> 00:16:00,950
in the seal teams we usually had to ride.
Gotcha.

232
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,720
Oh, here's a good one. Learn to swim.

233
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,070
Every young soldier without exception
should in the summer months be taught to

234
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:14,810
swim for it is sometimes impossible
to pass rivers on bridges,

235
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,820
but the flying and pursuing army both
are often obliged to swim over them.

236
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,800
A sudden melting of snow or fall of rain
often makes them overflow their banks

237
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,750
and in such a situation,

238
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,260
the danger is as great from ignorance
in swimming as from the enemy.

239
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,220
It's, I kind of take it for granted
that people know how to swim,

240
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,190
but it is not true. And when I figured
that out when I went to Navy boot camp,

241
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,030
because you'd think if you are joining
the navy navy, you'd know how to swim. No,

242
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,190
not true.
Not True at all.

243
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,210
People did not know a decent amount of
people did not know how to swim. Yeah.

244
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm with you. Student come from Cli where
you know everyone knows how to swim.

245
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,430
Even at two years old,
you know,

246
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,310
you know how to swim because you're
on the island and it's all, but yeah,

247
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,650
there's people, yeah, straight up. Some
people haven't even seen the water,

248
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,600
like the ocean or whatever.
Well,

249
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:08,810
there's definitely people that haven't
seen the ocean. I mean, when I went to,

250
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,800
when I went to seal training,

251
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,890
there was guys that had never been to the
ocean before. Yeah. They were from Iowa,

252
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,880
you know? No, they're just salt.
Why is the water tastes salty?

253
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,100
So yeah,
parents teach your kids how to swim.

254
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:25,530
They have those good programs now where
they do the little floating program.

255
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:28,130
So like even a little baby can
float themselves and stuff.

256
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,160
But you can look that up on youtube and
learn how to teach your baby to swim and

257
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,550
be careful. Effective. Yeah. It'd be
throwing the, uh, what's that called?

258
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,340
The safety. The safety tip. Yeah.
That's, you got to, you know,

259
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:46,490
when you're doing anything in the water,
you gotta be careful. Really careful.

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,280
Even when you're training in the,
you gotta be really careful.

261
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,300
One up one down is the rule. Like if
one person is doing some trainings,

262
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,980
someone's got to stand there and watch
them, make sure that they're safe.

263
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,470
But yeah, if you don't know how
to swim, I learned how to swim

264
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,653
back to the book.

265
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,620
No state can either be happy or secure
that is remiss and negligent in the

266
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:10,430
discipline of its troops.

267
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,860
Four is not profusion of riches or
excess of luxury that can influence our

268
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:23,190
enemies to court are or respect us.

269
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,270
Okay.

270
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,140
This can only be affected
by the terror of our arms.

271
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,100
It is an observation of
Cato that misconduct in the
common affairs of life may

272
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:35,970
be retrieved,

273
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,010
but that it is quite otherwise in war
where errors are fatal and without remedy

274
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,440
and are followed by immediate punishment.

275
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,400
Okay.

276
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,400
For the consequences of engaging in enemy
without skiller courage is that part

277
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:54,480
of the army is left on the field of battle
and those who remain received such an

278
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:59,400
impression from their defeat that they
dare not afterwards look the enemy in the

279
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:03,870
face.
That's powerful stuff right there.

280
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,643
Okay.

281
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,030
This can only be effected
by the terror of our arms.

282
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,270
That's underlying,

283
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,180
there's a little underlying threats
of violence and everything that,

284
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,260
I shouldn't say everything, but
dad, they're just, let me, let me,

285
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:22,020
let me break down a little bit more cause
I don't want to make a broad statement

286
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:24,390
about the whole world, but when I was
a young guy and it's the whole platoon,

287
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,150
it was definitely underlying
threats of violence.

288
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,490
I mean even with a big smile on your face,
even amongst total bros, like the, the,

289
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,200
the thing that's underlying it
was like, well, you know, yeah,

290
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:37,710
if this escalates down, you
know, we know how that could go.

291
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,090
So yeah.
Have the discipline train.

292
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,650
Yeah.

293
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,650
I don't know why I'm finding this book
like almost comical in how on point it is

294
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:02,430
with everything I think about, I
kinda noticed that or yeah, I'm just,

295
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,610
I mean the whole opening thing,
the whole opening,

296
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,200
the opening on slot of discipline,
you know,

297
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:13,700
I was straight up into it.
So back to the book, too.

298
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,960
Accustomed soldiers to carry burdens is
also an essential part of discipline.

299
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,400
Okay.

300
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,960
Recruits in particular should be obliged
frequently to carry a weight of not

301
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:28,961
less than 60 pounds exclusive of their
arms and to march with it in the ranks.

302
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,160
This is because on difficult expeditions,

303
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,250
the often find themselves under the
necessity of carrying their provisions as

304
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:35,180
well as their arms,

305
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,140
nor will they find this troublesome
when a nerd to it by costume,

306
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:41,870
which makes everything
easy. Boom. There you go.

307
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,710
Where the gear that you wear,
the gear that you're gonna fight with,

308
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,040
get used to it. These to, I used to, I

309
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,500
used to talk about this with
like discipline equals freedom.

310
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,700
The whole idea of it.

311
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,940
I'd say if you have the discipline
to wear your gear all the time,

312
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,300
then you'll have freedom of
movement when you need it. You know?

313
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,860
I kind of felt like that was a stretch.
Does that seem like a stretch? Well, no,

314
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:07,570
not anymore. Not Anymore. This kind of
back into the non stretch zone. Yeah.

315
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,350
Yep. For sure. Because like, yeah, okay,

316
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:13,570
so you have all your gear on,
right?

317
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,770
Jody Mitic was kind of talking about
this I think when he was like, Oh man,

318
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:20,410
you know, like it was just a pain in
the ass to wear and all this stuff.

319
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,080
That feeling, and that's a
real feeling. What is it, man?

320
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,840
This is a painted all this gear.
This is digging into my, you know,

321
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,760
I'm not used to it or kind of thing,
but man,

322
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:30,370
you get a guy who's really used to it,
but that's not even a factor factor.

323
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,130
He's free and it doesn't take, there's
two things that happens. Number one,

324
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:34,000
you get used to it.
Number two,

325
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,810
you figure out your gear so that your gear
works properly. Yes. So it's like, yeah,

326
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:41,320
you can cause cause your gear when
you first put it on, no matter,

327
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,700
you could go to the best gear store in
the world and you buy gear and it's not

328
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,280
going to fit you quite right. You're
gonna have to make little modifications.

329
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:50,080
You'd have to adjust it.
You have to put the weight somewhere else.

330
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,950
Now in football you wouldn't always
wear your gear and practice ride. Um,

331
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,910
it was pretty designated, like depending
on the day, you know, so you know,

332
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,860
two days you have full gear,
you know,

333
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:03,460
two days you have just
helmets and shoulder pads or
whatever. But yeah, you were,

334
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,490
you were when you were supposed to.
Some guys would like,

335
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,190
maybe not where their mouthpiece
or something like that,

336
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,820
but it'd be rare I think in the NFL.

337
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:16,160
Like they won't wear their
iPads or their hip. Goodness.

338
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:20,530
That's just cause it's a pain. I don't,
I dunno, I can't really speak for that.

339
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,870
I think I know the guys who run a lot
and if you take out your thigh pads and

340
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:28,360
you're like hip protectors and stuff,
it helps you run for sure.

341
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,140
But you run that risk and you should
train with it. You should train with it.

342
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,380
But here's the thing though,
if if there's a rule,

343
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,490
because some guys even in the
game they just won't wear it.

344
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,770
They just simply won't work.

345
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,790
But you do run the risk of like if
you get what's called a hip pointer,

346
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,390
there's an injury called a hip pointer
is basically your external obliques.

347
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,640
They kind of overlap your hipbone,
right?

348
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,690
And when a helmet or something hits
that and crushes your excellent,

349
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:56,470
our old bleak against your hipbones
called the hip pointer and it's,

350
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,590
it's a debilitating,

351
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:03,820
painful injury that kind of where even in
everyday life you were out of the game,

352
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,400
out of the game. And I've had it before.
So hip protectors will help against that.

353
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,390
So you run that risk, you know?
So it's up to you, man. I mean,

354
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:17,170
I think in college, I know in high school
it's like it's a rule you got to wear,

355
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,950
but um, I think in the NFL you
don't have to. That's good.

356
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,210
I think the overall point is,

357
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,240
and it sounds like the football was on
board with it and train how you fight.

358
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,100
Yeah. We are the gear train how you
fight, but it's tough to though in,

359
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,020
and this goes for any context
situation even obviously,

360
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,600
and really in the military,
but it's a,

361
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,670
it's almost like so obvious
in the military that's a
given where you can't train

362
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,690
exactly how you fight, you know,
so you can shoot each other. Yeah.

363
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,070
And exactly right. Like I
said, I used to tell guys that

364
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,420
I used to be like, hey, unfortunately
I'd, you know, I'd be like, unfortunately,

365
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,420
I can't put guys out here
to actually kill you.

366
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,810
You do the for for football.

367
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:57,860
As it turns out,

368
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,030
where you can't just have
guys going in life as a week.

369
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:05,690
Do you know somebody's hip pointers
already be all day? Yeah. Actually you,

370
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,850
so he goes on to talk about,
it,

371
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,300
talks about some slack here
going back to the book,

372
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,810
but negligence and off having by
degrees introduced a total relaxation of

373
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:20,330
discipline.

374
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,780
The soldiers began to think their
arm armor too heavy as they sold him,

375
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:24,614
put it on.

376
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,420
They first requested leave from the
emperor to lay aside the curiosity and

377
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:33,080
afterwards the helmet.
In consequence of this,

378
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,750
our troops and their
engagement with the goths,

379
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,740
we're often overwhelmed with
their showers of arrows.

380
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,440
So there you go and start
taking that a little shortcut.

381
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,120
And I like how he says it's by degrees.

382
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,140
Like no one just wakes up in the morning
and says, I'm going to be weaker. Now

383
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,680
they just, they just start to decay just
a little bit. Take a little shortcut,

384
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,390
you know, here's, here's a,
here's a, here's a workout,

385
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,060
a workout tip. Jockos
workout tips. I'm serious.

386
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,510
This is,

387
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,010
this is like something that goes through
my head when I'm doing some exercise.

388
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,120
Let's say it's squat day and let's say
it's, it's, I'm doing the 20 rep squats,

389
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,250
which is just painful.
Yes.

390
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,410
And I have that thought in my
head where sometimes, you know,

391
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:25,640
I'll be like, oh man, you know what, just
I'll just do 16 today. Cause you know,

392
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:27,800
like, I mean I worked really hard
yesterday and I'm kind of tying,

393
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,490
you're still doing it and I'm still doing
it. At least I did over there, no auto,

394
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,070
you know, Blah Blah Blah Blah. And
when I hear myself saying that,

395
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,930
I always think like that's the big,

396
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,430
that's the first step down
down the slippery slope. K
and I'm not going to do it.

397
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,130
I'm not going to do it.
Have you ever, have you ever
skipped it? Come on, be real.

398
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,190
Have you ever skipped it? Like you know
what those doubts, not doubts, but those,

399
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,990
those thoughts of, Hey, let me let me
slack. Not skipping a workout. I mean,

400
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:56,810
have you ever given you the only time?
The only time where I've been like,

401
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,530
you know what,

402
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,330
I'm not finishing this workout is like
I'll hurt something offer and this way

403
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,380
and I've done it where I've done it,
where I haven't done that.

404
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,370
That's a lesson learned.
Like I've been like,

405
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:09,770
I remember one time I was squatting
and I like felt a little, you know,

406
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:11,780
you get a little twinge in your back.

407
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,680
I got one of those and then I kept
going and then I was debilitated.

408
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:20,510
I was like eight. I was like not
good. But generally if, yeah,

409
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:23,450
no, when I, cause it's this,
that's why I'm saying this,

410
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:26,330
like that little conversation right
there is a good conversation to have with

411
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:29,930
yourself because I think about,
I think about that little,

412
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,730
you just give that little
bit of slack that time. Yeah.

413
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,410
And it's not good.
We know that.

414
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:40,220
Just in my mind I'm thinking that leads
to more slack right there. It does.

415
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,440
That leads to a little bit more next time
because next time you're to feel that

416
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:44,274
way at

417
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,990
15 reps instead of 16 yeah. Because
you've, even if it's subconsciously,

418
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:52,050
you established a new
little pres a precedent,

419
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:56,550
which is kind of just the standard
give a little bit. Yes, exactly.

420
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,050
So it's like it's different if you're
undefeated, right? If you're undefeated,

421
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,680
you either undefeated or
you not undefeated kind of
thing. Once you're defeated,

422
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:07,460
then you're kind of like, okay,
you know, let it sneak in there.

423
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,010
It's part of you now. I gotta say
I'm defeated trade. I'd call my car.

424
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,130
He ended the kind of at the end, you know,
I live and do metcon and it's, you know,

425
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,230
good.
And I will also straight up,

426
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:22,310
I'll be honest that it doesn't
happen very often. I mean,

427
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,190
I talk a lot of trash water, but it
doesn't happen very often. But Oh yeah.

428
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,380
There's times where we'll be like, ah,
well that workout was pretty solid on me.

429
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,300
I'll do, I'll make deals. That makes me
mad that, that, that makes me mad. And I,

430
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:35,050
and I,

431
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,480
I don't like that actually
hanging with you made me get,

432
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:43,570
gave me that mindset, which is a mindset
I simply did not have go deaf Koran.

433
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,780
No, but you know how you said it makes
you mad. Like I never had that feeling.

434
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,870
Never had the feeling
like, oh, I'm making it.

435
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,790
I just never thought of it that way ever.
Like not even a little bit,

436
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,300
didn't even consider thinking it that way.
But now, yeah, when I feel it like, oh,

437
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,121
maybe I'll do it tomorrow.

438
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:02,340
I really don't feel I actually have that
response where you kind of get mad at

439
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:06,190
it, at yourself kind of thing. It's like
you're split into two people. It is.

440
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,830
It helps.
It helps so much

441
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,950
check. All right. Let's
see. Going back to the book,

442
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,980
it was a constant custom among the old
Romans to exercise both cavalry and

443
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:27,591
infantry three times a month in
by marches of a certain length,

444
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,853
the foot.

445
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,540
We're obliged to march completely armed
the distance of 10 miles from the camp

446
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,740
and return in the most exact
order and with the military step,

447
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:40,920
which they changed and quickened
on some part of the march,

448
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,600
they made these marches not
in plain and even ground only,

449
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,900
but both cavalry and infantry were ordered
into difficult and uneven places and

450
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:55,680
to ascend or descend mountains to prepare
them for all kinds of accidents and

451
00:28:55,681 --> 00:29:00,681
familiarize them with the different
maneuvers that various situations of a

452
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:05,310
country may require.
Guys put some miles on foot.

453
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,660
Again, the reason that I wanted to
mention that part is it's not just,

454
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,940
it's not just about wearing the gear,

455
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,710
it's drying to simulate as closely as
you can to this situation that you're

456
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:20,490
going to be in. Same thing with
anything. Same thing with sports.

457
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:22,230
Same thing with business.
When you're training,

458
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,360
when you're training someone for business,

459
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,710
put them in that situation that they as
close as you can to what they're going

460
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:31,544
to be in.
Yeah.

461
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,940
Here it continues to enumerate
the different nations,

462
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,920
so formidable of old, all which now
are subject to the Romans would be.

463
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,720
So he saying like we
beat down so many people,

464
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:46,520
we can't when I'm going to take
the time to talk about them all.

465
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,450
But the security established by long
piece has altered their dispositions,

466
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,480
drawn them off from military to civil
pursuits and infused into them a love of

467
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,950
idleness and ease.

468
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,860
Okay?

469
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,850
Again, this guy's writing several
hundred years after Caesar,

470
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,480
so he's talking about the, you
know, the, the, the slippery slope,

471
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,530
okay.

472
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,320
Hence a relaxation of military discipline.

473
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Insensibly ensued then a neglect of
it and it's sunk at last into entire

474
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,103
oblivion.

475
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,310
So he's watching the
fall of the Roman Empire

476
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,710
and where does it start? Lack of
discipline. When the troops boom,

477
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,750
I'm getting a kick out of this boat.

478
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,910
The necessity therefore of discipline
cannot be too often inculcated as well as

479
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:49,511
the strict attention requisite in the
choice and training of new levies.

480
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,230
Don't, you can't ever let
up the slack. You can't,

481
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,110
can't ever say it's
okay not to do that rep,

482
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,820
uh,
that that's in the book,

483
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:06,560
he goes into a long sort of a long,

484
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:11,561
long description of how they
were organized like man by man,

485
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,520
truth by troop. Uh, not going to
go too deep into that, you know.

486
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,030
Well one of the things he does mention
in that section is as about how when they

487
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:23,870
stopped doing a good job replacing the
soldiers that were leaving, you know,

488
00:31:23,871 --> 00:31:25,600
you're,
you're not keeping your,

489
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:30,550
not keeping people coming in and
not keeping them trained up and he,

490
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,770
this is a good thing. I think this
is good for any team situation.

491
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,120
The expense of keeping up good
or bad troops is the same.

492
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,190
Okay.

493
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,930
But it depends wholly on you. So I
think that's a good statement. No,

494
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,640
you got,
you got some good members on your team.

495
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:51,840
You got some bad members on the team.
It costs you the same to keep him. Yeah.

496
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,930
You got to decide how you're going to,

497
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,910
how are you going to
manage that situation?

498
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,510
Back to the book in former times,

499
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,840
the discipline was so strict that the
Tribune's or officers not only cause the

500
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:14,540
troops under their command to be
exercised daily in their presence,

501
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,720
but we're themselves so perfect in their
military exercise as to set them by

502
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:20,954
example.

503
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:27,010
Nothing does so much honor to
the abilities or application
of the Tribune as the

504
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:32,501
appearance and discipline of the
soldiers when they're apparel is neat and

505
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:33,440
clean,

506
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,210
their arms bright and in good order and
when they perform their exercises and

507
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:40,700
evolutions with dexterity,

508
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,533
no big deal

509
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,513
more.

510
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:58,250
He's talking about just
keeping the elements

511
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,220
organized in a combat situation.

512
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,910
Less the soldiers in the confusion of
battle should be separated from their

513
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:06,510
comrades.

514
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:11,130
Every cohort had its shield painted
in a manner peculiar to itself.

515
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,290
The name of each soldier was also written
on his shield together with the number

516
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:19,440
of the cohort and century
to which he belonged.

517
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,090
I liked that.
I had a note in here about how we,

518
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,140
we would name our vehicles so he'd know
what vehicle to get into. You know,

519
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:33,740
like the Harvey's piece would have names
so you'd know which vehicle is yours?

520
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,010
Well, the one called Zev, so they
had all kinds of names for him.

521
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:42,770
My first deployment to Iraq,
my first deployment to Iraq,

522
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:47,610
they were named after the movie.
Oh,

523
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,530
movie, right? Yeah. They were named
after a movie. It's about bowling,

524
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,760
but it's not the big Lebowski. Kingpin.
He was a kingpin. That was the name.

525
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,580
It was one of the Humvees
was called big urn.

526
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,890
Now What's interesting is the
humvees originally were not named,

527
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:05,810
they were numbered one,
two, three, four, five,

528
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:07,400
six and that seems like
a pretty squared away.

529
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:09,860
Like I joke would be good with
that just to give him a number.

530
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,340
Here's a problem with it.
When you're going on an operation,

531
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:16,520
you'd go into a building to do
uh, uh, a take down of a building.

532
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,360
The vehicles move around, they get, they
got to adjust. And when you come back out,

533
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:24,170
they might not necessarily be
an order numerically. So guys,

534
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:26,470
but guys would go one, two, three,
oh that's my vehicle. Gotcha.

535
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,600
So they get in the wrong vehicle,
which might not seem like a big deal.

536
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,940
But then when you're trying to get a
head count and someone is not the right

537
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:33,870
vehicle and the vehicle
commanders like I'm,

538
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,050
I'm supposed to have eight
guys and I only have seven.

539
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,710
Now we're trying to sitting on
the x trying to get a headcount.

540
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,040
And that's problematic. But if you
know what your name of your vehicle is,

541
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,780
you confirm it and they're
written on the side.

542
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,380
Nice big letters looking for big
urn. You see it, you jump in.

543
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,500
That make sense with the,
with the numbers.

544
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:56,501
Cause I think just by nature we assign
numbers to things for all kinds of weird

545
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:57,231
reasons.
You know,

546
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:00,200
like where if there's three things that
are like if I see okay there's three

547
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:03,620
bottles in a row mean you don't even
have to know each other. And I say, Hey,

548
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:06,080
grab the third bottle. It's
kind of, there's a shirt,

549
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,000
there's a kind of a ambiguous
understanding. Okay.

550
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:10,160
Then went the furthest one on the
right. You know, it's like that.

551
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:13,640
So the numbers can jam you. We
numbered this podcast. Yeah.

552
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:16,210
Cause it's like chronological.
So,

553
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,480
but interestingly they could've
had just names. Yeah. In fact,

554
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:23,060
maybe they should have, remember when
the UFC, she used to be numbered.

555
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,400
They're numbered and then
there's all know what it was.

556
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,323
This is what I was thinking.

557
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,940
They used to give them a number and then
they would have like a crazy name. Yeah,

558
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:37,130
yeah. The title. I'd
like glory or whatever.

559
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,200
And then they just started just calling
them the names of the guys that were

560
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:42,780
fighting. Yeah. Which
makes sense once you have,

561
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,670
that's kind of what
I'm thinking right now.

562
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,230
Like someone that's looking
for a certain episode. Yeah.

563
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,260
They, they would, they might
not remember the number,

564
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:55,270
but they remember the book or
they remember the person. Yeah.

565
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,780
That's kind of interesting.
But we couldn't,

566
00:35:56,781 --> 00:36:00,810
but we do kind of do it like that kind of,
but what is,

567
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,950
is there value to having a number
aside from keeping a count of how many

568
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,930
episodes there are? Well I
think, I think someone now can,

569
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,230
if you know what one you're
looking for and then you find it,

570
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,250
then you can go and find it
easy in your platform. Yeah.

571
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,470
But the easiest way if
you want to know what,

572
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,540
cause sometimes I don't
remember what a particular,

573
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:26,541
if you Google Jocko podcast and then
whatever thing that you're looking for.

574
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,930
Yeah. It'll take you to
the youtube video. Right.

575
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,860
It'll take you to the youtube video. Yeah.
Cause the youtube videos that put the,

576
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,810
somebody just told me on, on, somebody
said, hey, you should review this book.

577
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,790
Marise Stratacon strategic
comms strategic on. Yeah.

578
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,670
And I said,
he said,

579
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:50,370
you should really read this book and
this guy has like been in the game for

580
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,610
awhile. And I said, you
should check out podcast.

581
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:58,611
And I didn't run a one number was I
googled Jocko strategic con and I found 57

582
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,940
boom. Done. So now, or you can say 57 C's
to go back in there and look, right? Yeah.

583
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,243
Check.

584
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,940
Yeah.

585
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,110
All right. Talking about drilling
the troops back to the book,

586
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,370
the younger soldiers and recruits went
through their drills of every kind,

587
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:19,230
every morning and afternoon, and the
veterans and most expert regularly,

588
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,620
once a day length of service or age
alone will never form a military man for

589
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:28,890
after serving many years.

590
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:32,880
And undisciplined soldier is
still a novice in his profession.

591
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,710
By practice only can be acquired agility
of body and the skill requisite to

592
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:48,300
engage an enemy with advantage,
especially in a close fight.

593
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,390
But the most essential point of all is
to teach soldiers to keep their ranks and

594
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:55,770
never abandon their colors.

595
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:00,690
And the most difficult evolutions thus
men thus trained are never at a loss

596
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,020
amidst the greatest confusion of numbers.

597
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,360
The recruits likewise,

598
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:10,530
are to be exercised with wooden swords
at the post to be taught to attack this

599
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:15,330
imaginary antagonist on all sides
and to aim at the side, feet or head,

600
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,910
both with the point and edge of the sword.

601
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,893
It sounds,

602
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:31,530
I think some of those movies that came
out because this isn't sound glorious to

603
00:38:32,651 --> 00:38:35,950
me, that maybe it doesn't to
you, but to me that awesome. Mm.

604
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,360
And then like movies like Braveheart
where they're showing kind of the sword

605
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:44,380
battles. Yeah. And how
just psycho it was. I mean,

606
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:45,370
that's a good reminder.

607
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,200
Yeah.
Big Time.

608
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,940
Back to the book.
In short,

609
00:38:52,941 --> 00:38:57,260
both legionaries and auxiliary troop
should continually be drilled in cutting

610
00:38:57,261 --> 00:39:01,640
wood, carrying burdens, passing
ditches, swimming in the sea or rivers,

611
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,180
marching in the full step and even
running with their arms and baggage.

612
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:08,510
So in there,
so that a nerd to labor in peace,

613
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,210
they may find no difficulty in war.

614
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,763
Okay.

615
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,260
For as the well trained
soldiers eager for action.

616
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,830
So does the untaught fear it

617
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,580
in war?
Discipline is superior to strength.

618
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:27,730
Okay.

619
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,560
But if that discipline is neglected,

620
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,700
there is no longer any difference
between the soldier and the peasant.

621
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:41,270
The old maxim is certain that the very
essence of an art consists in constant

622
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,283
practice.

623
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:49,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

624
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,090
Discipline is superior to strength.

625
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:01,380
This is a solid book.
The Art,

626
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,360
the very essence of an art
consists in constant practice,

627
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,870
so whatever it is you want to be good
at. Yeah, that's how you get good at it.

628
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,650
Lafe and I just wrote another book.
We've been writing a lot.

629
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,240
I've been writing at a ton.
Sure.

630
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:20,350
And you can see the first draft was
probably five times better than our first

631
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:22,260
draft of our first book.
And you know,

632
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,610
we both have done a lot of
writing in the military, you know,

633
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,750
in college and all that. But your
practice, you get better. Yeah.

634
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,550
Jujitsu, guess what? You practice,
you get better. Yes sir. He do

635
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,170
pull ups. You're going
to pull ups. Do pull ups.

636
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,223
Okay,

637
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,030
here we go.

638
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,340
Yeah.

639
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,600
The last Simonian's made war.
Their chief study.

640
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,190
Yeah.

641
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:57,420
They affirmed to be the first who
reasoned on the events of battles and

642
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:58,860
committed their observations.

643
00:40:58,861 --> 00:41:03,861
They're on to writing with such success
as to reduce the military art before

644
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:08,730
considered as totally dependent on
courage or fortune to contain to certain

645
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:10,920
rules and fixed principles.

646
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,240
As a consequence,

647
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:19,110
they established schools of tactics for
the instruction of youth in all of the

648
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:20,220
maneuvers of war.

649
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,803
Okay.

650
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:26,860
How worthy of admiration are these people
for particularly applying themselves

651
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,660
to this study?

652
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:33,660
Evan art without which
no other art can exist.

653
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,400
Boom. That's interesting.
Hmm. It's interesting.

654
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,320
Can you imagine it? Well for me, you know,

655
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:46,830
actually I can't imagine when
you're a kid you think like wars,

656
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:51,350
just like Ah, just charge and then
as soon as you get into the teams,

657
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,270
sure.
Like all there's maneuvers you can do.

658
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,900
There's things you need to make happen.
There's ways you can get advantage.

659
00:41:56,901 --> 00:42:00,740
It's not just what they call it, courage
or fortunate. It's not just that at all.

660
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,020
There's a whole lot of things involved.

661
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,730
And it's also interesting
that they were doing,

662
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,830
they were doing studies
and debriefs on the war,

663
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,670
on the battles. Hmm. Cause it sounds like
people weren't. And he says, hey look,

664
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,370
they were the first two reasons on the
events of battles and committed their

665
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:21,260
observations they're on to writing with
such as the sec success to figure out

666
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,050
that there's a military art
and how,

667
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,050
you know, what, how fired up is it that

668
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,010
to study this art of war without,

669
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,610
without which no other
art can possibly exist

670
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,810
too strong for you, I don't know
for is too strong. I can see you.

671
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:47,960
That's a bold statement for sure.
It's a real bold statement.

672
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,820
I don't think I've thought about it
enough to offer any sort of an opinion on

673
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,470
the deal, but hey man, I dig it.

674
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,010
Kinda like Kinda like exercise in life
or health in life. Yeah, that's true.

675
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,140
But yeah, sure. Cool. You
seem pretty fired up about it.

676
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,260
You do.

677
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,260
And this is where George Washington
statement kind of paraphrased from back to

678
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:16,640
the book. He therefore who desires
piece should prepare for war.

679
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:23,750
He who aspires to victory should spare
no pains to form his soldiers and he who

680
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:30,150
hopes for success should fight
on principle, not chance.

681
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:31,950
Yeah,

682
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,950
no one dares to offend or insult a
power of known superiority in action.

683
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,740
Do you get bummed out that you
didn't learn this in third grade?

684
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,180
Like this whole thing? Uh, yeah, yeah.

685
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,080
Yes. Right. Including Jujitsu
for sure. Yeah. Well, yeah,

686
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,740
I feel like it.
And you can,

687
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,390
I learned this kind of from you in the
beginning where you know how you have

688
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:05,520
this kind of big picture kind of mindset,
the long game. You're always like,

689
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,470
you always correct me when I have
this like short sighted. Yeah.

690
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,450
That's what I wish I understood
slash even. I don't know,

691
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:17,290
off kids even capable really?
Well, no, you're 100% right.

692
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,650
And I've actually said this many times
that kids have a hard time connecting

693
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,380
what they're doing now with where
it puts them in the future. Yeah.

694
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,350
And I, I say kids and kids, I mean
me, everyone, I mean I'm better now,

695
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,790
but when you're, when you're a
kid, like it made it and kids,

696
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,770
some kids are different.
You know, like some of my,

697
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,280
some of the kids that my
kids hang around with,

698
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,910
some of them are dialed where
they've just got a vision.

699
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:48,691
They know where they're going,

700
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:50,010
they know where they're
going to be an eight years,

701
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,940
they know what they want to do.
That's not a majority of the kids.

702
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,990
Most kids are, you know, like, well, Hey,

703
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,750
I can get this right now and that's cool.

704
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,930
And they don't think about how it's gonna
affect him when the future. And that's,

705
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,060
that's,
that's just really problematic.

706
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,320
Not Understanding that long game is
really problematic and I think we do a bad

707
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:15,321
caught a bad job of teaching it as
parents and as teachers and as a society.

708
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,770
Yeah, yeah. Agree.

709
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,600
Well, I mean there's,
cause you have, you don't,

710
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:28,601
like JP says this and Lafe said this
where they are like when I was a kid even

711
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:33,770
you say you want it to be some sort of a
commando, at least you had like an idea,

712
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:37,490
you know, so there was at the very least
somewhat in your mind it'd be like,

713
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:42,110
hey for sure if I do this, that
was, that was a savior. Yeah.

714
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,950
So I think some families just through
tradition and stuff like that,

715
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,100
they'll have that structure like,
hey, you're a, I don't know,

716
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:51,620
you're a Johnson so you do this x, y, z.

717
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,500
And it's just a matter of
getting the kid to embrace that.

718
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,360
Which is really kind of like,
either they do or they know. Yeah.

719
00:45:58,361 --> 00:46:02,420
I mean I think if you're fair
to your kids, because the law,

720
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:06,410
I think a lot of times like we get caught
up in like our own feelings, you know,

721
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:07,880
in this thing like, well
you know, I don't know,

722
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:09,710
your kid's not listening to you or
something like that. You're like,

723
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,720
oh my kid's not listening to me.
You know,

724
00:46:11,721 --> 00:46:14,480
you get caught up in the feeling
that emotions, yeah. You know,

725
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,740
that we're rather than,
hey, you know, that's,

726
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,710
it is a problem that needs
to be solved kind of thing.

727
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,640
So I think that's the way you
can alienate your kids real easy.

728
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:25,310
And it's a common thing
I think, where, you know,

729
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,980
we'll alienator kids and then
they won't embrace the, the,

730
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:32,630
the pride and tradition of your family.
Cause they're like alienated.

731
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:35,140
You alienated him in one right now that
sometimes you don't even know that you

732
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:39,050
alien. You know how they're like, oh
he's in a rebellious phase. You know,

733
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:42,020
like sure there is such thing as a
rebellious kind of phase because they know

734
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:42,651
certain kids,

735
00:46:42,651 --> 00:46:46,850
they gather this or they gain the sense
of like empowerment in certain ways,

736
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:47,990
you know,
so we want to test it out.

737
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:49,280
They want to test the
boundaries and all that.

738
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,520
Unconsciously they know they've got to
break away from their parents and they

739
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:55,700
got to start practicing that.
It seems, it seems natural,

740
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,590
but if you have successfully alienated
your kid when that rebellious phase

741
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:04,220
comes, they're stepping right outside the
game. They're starting their own thing.

742
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,070
In fact, they'll give, they're going
to have some resentment against dad.

743
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:10,900
Who is this unfair tyrant
who lame heaps of this stuff.

744
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:15,920
The kids never think their parents
know anything. As a parent,

745
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:20,630
I understand why I totally don't like,
ah, I get it now. But that is funny.

746
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,850
That really funny actually.
I mean we just don't,

747
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,920
it's not just parents like your
teachers don't know anything.

748
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,350
I'm not speaking for everybody,
but like when I was a kid,

749
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,040
my parents didn't know anything. Teachers
didn't know anything. I knew everything.

750
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:33,940
Dorks, budget, idiots. God, I'm stupid.

751
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,490
So if you're listening to this and you're,
you know,

752
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,570
under the age of 40 you
might want to listen to your,

753
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,740
all right,
that's good stuff.

754
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:50,650
He who desires piece should
prepare for war. Remember that one

755
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,850
back to the book in army to numerous.

756
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,060
So now he's talking about the size of
the army and the army to numerous is

757
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:00,400
subject to many dangers in inconveniences.

758
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:05,430
It's bulk makes it slow and unwieldy in
its motions and it is obliged to march

759
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:08,890
and columns of great length that is
exposed to the risk of being continually

760
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:13,570
harassment, assaulted by
inconsiderable parties of the enemy.

761
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,260
The encumbrance of the baggage is often
an occasion of its being surprised and

762
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:23,950
its passage throughout
difficult places or over rivers.

763
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:29,050
The difficulty providing forage for such
numbers of horses than other beasts of

764
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:33,730
burden is very great.
Besides the scarcity of provisions,

765
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,860
which is to be great,

766
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:40,861
carefully guarded against in
all expeditions soon ruined
such large armies where

767
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:46,540
the consumption is so great that not
withstanding the greatest care and filling

768
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:47,500
the magazines,

769
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,760
they must begin to fail in a short time
and sometimes they unavoidably will be

770
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:53,410
distressed for want of water.

771
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:57,280
But if unfortunately this
immense army should be defeated,

772
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,370
the numbers last must
necessarily be very great.

773
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,640
And the remainder who saved themselves
by flight too much dispirited to be

774
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:07,390
brought to action again.

775
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,040
And I read that whole thing so I
could read this, which is saying, hey,

776
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:15,790
like do you get too many people? I read
that whole thing so I could read this.

777
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,360
The ancients taught by experience,

778
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,420
preferred discipline to numbers.

779
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:27,760
Like we'd rather just have a small
squared away group then a ton of guys.

780
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:32,230
So where I see this with businesses,
this is what businesses is.

781
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:36,790
As businesses grow,
it becomes harder for them to turn,

782
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,770
right?
It's harder for them to pivot.

783
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,820
So you get big companies
that when they were small,

784
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,340
they were all agile and they were
making things happen and they can change

785
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:47,440
direction and then as they get
bigger and bigger and bigger,

786
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,850
they lose the ability to do that.

787
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,660
And so you've got to pay attention
to that and what you have to do,

788
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,800
there's a couple of solutions. It's like
the solution is, yeah, you can stay small,

789
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:57,501
but you don't want to spend it.

790
00:49:57,501 --> 00:49:59,470
Stay small as a business because
you can't just like, you know,

791
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,120
it's cool to stay small as an army,

792
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:03,730
but there's only so much you can
do with limited number of people.

793
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So what you have to do is you have to
start to become more aware of what's

794
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:11,320
going, what's going on, what's
coming down the pipe in the future.

795
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,230
Because it's gonna take
longer for you to pivot this,

796
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,410
this big monster you've got.
So you've got to do it.

797
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:22,510
You got to pay more attention. So when
you grow in size, this is classic.

798
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:26,320
When you grow in size a a business.

799
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:31,860
If the leaders of the business continued
to focus down and in to the company,

800
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,740
they won't see what's
coming over the horizon.

801
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:39,620
And that's when I get caught off guard
and now they don't have time to pivot

802
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:40,430
because there are a lot bigger.

803
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,650
But they used to get away with it cause
they were a little small company that

804
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:45,080
could come into work on Monday and they
could talk to everyone in one sitting

805
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:46,730
and everyone gets on
board and we move forward.

806
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,040
You fast forward that and you go from
50 employees to 500 that are now,

807
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:57,530
you know, spread out over a large
geography. You can't make that quick move.

808
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,740
And so what you have to do as a leader,
as as you grow,

809
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:05,270
you need to adjust your frame of vision
from looking down inside your company to

810
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:09,660
looking up and into the
future. If you don't make that
transition, you can't, you,

811
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,760
you think you can turn things
quickly, you can't. You can't.

812
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,790
It's a big army and a big army has to be,

813
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,180
it's hard to control a big army
and it takes more lead time. Yeah.

814
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:26,350
And so that's the focus that you
have to adjust to as you grow.

815
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:31,960
You know? That's a good way up. So how do
you do it then? Like you as the, well you,

816
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,930
what you do is you have people
underneath you if you're making widgets.

817
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:37,160
And I was,
when we started off,

818
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:40,190
we had eight people and I was in a factory
all day checking out your widgets and

819
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:41,570
making sure that they were good to go.

820
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,930
And I was testing them myself and I was
making little adjustments. That's cool.

821
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,130
That's fine. It works when we had eight
people. But now when we get 40 people,

822
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:51,260
I need to start going,
okay, echo, can you,

823
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:54,620
can you pay attention to the widgets in
here? And then when I get to 300 people,

824
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:57,260
I need to have four or five echoes that
are down there that are watching this

825
00:51:57,261 --> 00:52:00,140
stuff. So, so that's what you gotta do.
You gotta adjust your field of vision.

826
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:03,590
You've got to adjust. Your focus
are all too. And what fools people,

827
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,210
what fools people,

828
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:10,390
what catches them off guard is that
they think they can still pivot quickly

829
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,280
because they were able to do
it when they were smaller.

830
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,500
When they had 30 or 40 people,
they were able to pivot quickly.

831
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:20,050
They've got 300 they can't do it
and they get caught off guard here.

832
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,790
Watch out for that. Kind of
like a big cruise ship, right?

833
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,880
Come talk to like a little speed bump.
Of course like this.

834
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:29,600
Of course those things take miles to
turn miles. Those big oil tankers,

835
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:32,360
they take miles to stop back to the book.

836
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:36,560
The excellence of their discipline made
their small army sufficient to encounter

837
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:38,060
all their enemies with success.

838
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:43,061
Now this is something else I see a
lot in business world and this is very

839
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:46,370
common, right? You get the, you
got the big, the big business,

840
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,180
the big gorilla in the room or whatever
and they can't pivot very quickly.

841
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:54,110
Well then you get the smaller companies
that are very agile and they start

842
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:57,130
picking away at the big guy. That's what
he's talking about right here. And like,

843
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,640
just because you're small
doesn't mean you can't,

844
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:02,210
you can't take a shot at the title. You
know, you could, you could move quickly.

845
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:05,360
And if there's chaos going on,
that's when you can adopt.

846
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:08,750
Now are there advantages to being the big
company with lots of money and lots of

847
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:12,020
people and you're very stable?
Oh yeah, absolutely. So,

848
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,480
and are there advantages to
being small? Yes, there are.

849
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:19,510
The mistake that people on both
sides make is they view themselves,

850
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,940
they don't understand what their strengths
and weaknesses are and they don't

851
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:25,410
understand the strength and weaknesses
of their opponents. Right? Okay.

852
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,140
So they say if there's someone
that can move quicker than them,

853
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:30,060
they all don't worry about them
were bigger and more stable.

854
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:33,360
All those people are maneuvering on you
and they're sticking the needles in your

855
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:36,480
feet and eventually those little needles
get infected and there's a problem.

856
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,250
Yeah. Got, you know, situation
going on. So you have to constantly,

857
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:44,150
as a leader, and again, this is why
leadership is important. You have to,

858
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,130
as a leader, need to assess
what's the strength of that group,

859
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,370
what's the weaknesses? What is,
what are our strengths? Right.

860
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:53,370
We keep hearing this again over and
over again throughout all these ancient

861
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:57,240
military leaders. Know Yourself, know
your opponent, know your strengths,

862
00:53:57,241 --> 00:54:00,570
know your weaknesses.
For sure people fail to do that.

863
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,393
Problematic.

864
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,793
Hmm.

865
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,230
Here we go.
Uh,

866
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:15,330
famine makes greater havoc in an army
than the enemy and is more terrible than

867
00:54:16,601 --> 00:54:20,750
the sword. You know, I, every time I,

868
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,300
we've read that in the last couple books,

869
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,790
people talking about how it's
better to starve your enemy.

870
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:26,650
It just makes me really,

871
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:31,360
really thankful that there's abundant
food in this country right now.

872
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,560
It really does. I mean, I,
I've never been starving.

873
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,280
And can you imagine starving to death?

874
00:54:39,281 --> 00:54:44,230
It's gotta be absolutely heinous.
Yeah. Worse than the sword.

875
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,620
According to the Getty's

876
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:53,590
and army drawn together from different
parts sometimes is disposed to mutiny and

877
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,720
the troops though not inclined to fight,

878
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:59,970
pretend to be angry at not being
led against the enemy such seditious

879
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,761
dispositions.

880
00:55:00,761 --> 00:55:05,020
Prince Burley's principally
showed themselves in those
who have lived in their

881
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:08,290
quarters and idleness and a feminist.

882
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:13,291
See these men on a costume
to the necessarily fatigue
of the field are disgusted

883
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:15,700
at its severity.

884
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:21,830
Their ignorance of discipline makes them
afraid of action and inspires them with

885
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:26,960
insolence.
So you let your,

886
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,930
it's one of those, it's
one of those dichotomies.

887
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,200
That's what it is. And if you let
your people do whatever they want,

888
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:39,980
they get soft and then they
start to rebel. You want to
talk about kids, you know,

889
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:42,440
let your kids do whatever you want,
whatever they want,

890
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,980
and see how that works out for you.
Lack of discipline of your kids.

891
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:49,100
You're gonna end up with some
rebellious kids. Yes. Now,

892
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:53,030
am I saying that you need to beat them
like a dog? I was into submission. No,

893
00:55:53,031 --> 00:55:56,260
I'm not saying that at all because then
you don't what that dog is that dogs

894
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,820
crazy. That dog will bite
you at some point, right?

895
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,060
Or somebody else or somebody
else is problematic.

896
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,370
So you have to find the balance
between those two things.

897
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,590
He says there's,
there's several remedies for this evil.

898
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:16,330
Let them be constantly employed either
in the field days or in the inspection of

899
00:56:16,971 --> 00:56:20,030
their arms. They should not be
allowed to be absent on furlough.

900
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:23,560
They should be frequently called by role
and trained to be exact in observance

901
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:24,580
of every signal.

902
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,270
Let them be exercised in the use of the
bow and throwing missile weapons and

903
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:33,160
stones both with the hand and sling and
there and with the wooden stored sword

904
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:35,050
at the post.
Let them be,

905
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:40,140
let all this be continually repeated and
let them be often kept under arms until

906
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:41,230
they are tired.

907
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,210
Let them be exercised in running and
leaping to facilitate the passing of

908
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:49,690
ditches. And if their quarters
are near the sea or the river,

909
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,070
let them all without exception be obliged
in the summer to have the frequent

910
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:58,480
practice of swimming.
Let them be accustomed to march,

911
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:04,270
March through thickets and closures and
broken grounds to fell trees and to cut

912
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:08,260
out timber to break ground and defend a
post against their comrades who are an

913
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:12,160
endeavor to dispossess
them and in the encounter,

914
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:17,190
each party should use their shields to
dislodge and bear down there antagonists,

915
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:22,690
all the different kinds of troops thus
trained and exercised in their quarters.

916
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,840
We'll find themselves inspired
with emulation for glory
and eagerness for action

917
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,450
when they come to take the field.
In short,

918
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:38,630
a soldier who has proper confidence in
his own skill and strength entertains,

919
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,330
no thought of mutiny.
That's awesome.

920
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:46,950
Yeah. These guys were doing force on
force training. He's saying, look,

921
00:57:46,951 --> 00:57:47,611
you're not going to use stores,

922
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:50,820
but you're going to go against each
other with your shields and fight for it.

923
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,580
And, and this is, again, I've,

924
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:56,310
I've answered that question a bunch
of times where people, you know,

925
00:57:56,311 --> 00:57:59,400
how do you build morale and your team?
It's like make them train hard,

926
00:57:59,401 --> 00:58:04,380
make them work hard. Now the real
trick is to make them train hard,

927
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:06,030
make them work hard.
But at the same time,

928
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:08,070
what you do is you give them
ownership of that training.

929
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:09,940
So they're running the training.
Yeah.

930
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,070
They come up with the ideas at you just
respect the hardcore training that their

931
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:18,600
debt they're doing and you do it with
them. Yeah. You don't just inputs.

932
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:21,480
It's different than just
imposing on the team.

933
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:25,530
Like we're going to do this hardcore
training that will create a mutiny if

934
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:26,670
you're not careful.
Yeah.

935
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,180
Yeah.

936
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,890
Especially if you're not out
there doing it with a more,

937
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:33,760
if you don't explain why it's
important. Yeah. I read this thing.

938
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:38,420
This is to kind of add to that. Well,
I think so anyway. They felt, was it,

939
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,630
I forget what it was, but it said and
allow for success. So like when you train,

940
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,140
you know, you train our train hard, train
hard, but allow for success for sure.

941
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,370
Because if there's no success,

942
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:50,410
it's like morale goes down
after awhile and whatever. Yeah.

943
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,100
Something like this for sure. You can't
just, I just said can't beat that dog.

944
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't beat that dog.

945
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,250
It is much more to the credit of a general
to form his troop to submission and

946
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:08,251
obedience by habit and discipline than
to be obliged to force them to their duty

947
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,660
by the terror of punishment.

948
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:15,400
So he's making the reason I pointed
that out because it's making a clear,

949
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:21,350
a clear delineation between
discipline and punishment. Discipline,

950
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:24,650
good punishment, bad. And he's saying
those are two kind of opposite things.

951
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,200
So I think that's very important.
I think so too.

952
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,730
And it's important to remember that
you're treating your people good,

953
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,340
you're taking care of them,
that's what you're doing.

954
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:39,410
And you don't necessarily take care
of them by making their life soft.

955
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:44,330
You take care of them by making their
life disciplined and hard not to beat them

956
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:48,000
down. There's a balance, but
that's what you got to find. Yeah.

957
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,450
Back to the book.

958
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:54,560
It is essential to know the character
of the enemy and of their principal

959
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:58,580
officers, whether they be rash or
cautious, enterprising or timid,

960
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,980
whether they fight on
principle or from chance.

961
01:00:00,981 --> 01:00:05,300
And whether the nations they have been
engaged with were brave or cowardly.

962
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,070
So again,
know your enemy.

963
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:14,170
You must by no means venture to lead
and irresolute or different army to a

964
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:20,231
general engagement for soldiers unused
to fighting for a length of time must be

965
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:25,310
considered in the same light as recruits.

966
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,980
So He's saying if you've got people that
haven't fought in a while and they're a

967
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:32,420
little bit nervous, then you got to
figure that they're just like recruits.

968
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,740
You can't always trust them.

969
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:38,130
Then he talks about the general and says,

970
01:00:38,131 --> 01:00:42,990
if he finds himself in many respects
superior to his adverts adversary,

971
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,190
he must by no means differ
bringing on the engagement.

972
01:00:47,191 --> 01:00:49,800
So if you're in a better spot than
the enemy or you can take them go.

973
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,560
But if he knows himself inferior,

974
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,060
he must avoid general actions and
endeavor to succeed by surprises and

975
01:00:57,061 --> 01:00:57,894
stratagems.

976
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:03,330
This when skillfully managed
by good generals have often
given them victory over

977
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:07,500
enemies, superior, both in numbers and
strength. So this is common sense stuff.

978
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,410
If you think the enemy is better than you,
don't fight them head on.

979
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,520
That's guerrilla warfare. If you think
the enemy is bigger and stronger than you,

980
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,600
you don't fight them head on.

981
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,613
Hmm.

982
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:21,950
All Arts and trades,
whatever,

983
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:25,730
are brought to perfection
by continual practice.

984
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:32,260
How much more should this maxim true in
inconsiderable matters be observed in

985
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:39,431
affairs of importance and
how much superior to all
others is the art of war by

986
01:01:41,301 --> 01:01:43,160
which our liberties are preserved,

987
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:48,370
our dignities perpetuated
and the provinces and the
whole empire itself exists.

988
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,593
You don't really like that,

989
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:59,140
you're suspect, I think. Do you,
do you like it enough for both?

990
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:04,060
Okay. We'll take that. That's true though.

991
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:08,620
Yeah. I actually, I can dig it. Yeah.
I mean, let's face the facts here.

992
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,240
If it wasn't for,

993
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,400
if it wasn't for war, well then you'd
just be enslaved by someone. I mean,

994
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,980
I'd love for it to not be that,
that for that to not be the

995
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,020
case,
but if it wasn't for war,

996
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:25,170
you would just be enslaved by people
or someone else that was someone that

997
01:02:25,171 --> 01:02:28,500
believed in war would, you'd be the slave
of them. Yeah. That's how it would work.

998
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,570
Sorry, I'm sorry. That's, that's,
that's the nature of the world. No, no,

999
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:38,070
you're actually right.
Yeah. Cause it's like,

1000
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,410
it's like the hope or wish that
everyone was just perfect. Of course.

1001
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:47,250
That'd be great. Or actually
in a way would it be great
though? You know how like,

1002
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,750
sure, that'd be great. Everyone got along,

1003
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:53,751
everyone singing Kumbaya but isn't isn't
like stress or imbalance or whatever.

1004
01:02:53,911 --> 01:02:56,910
Isn't that the catalyst for any
kind of progress of any kind?

1005
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,560
What do we do if everyone was just happy
and it's just all good, satisfied, right?

1006
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,650
I don't know man. I think we'd be in the
stone age. I just think it's bad. Yeah,

1007
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:06,570
we probably would be.
But guess what?

1008
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,310
If we're in the stone age and I see that
you got a piece of whatever piece of

1009
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:13,230
meat or a rock that I want,
guess what?

1010
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:17,090
I know best scene that you
were talking to reality. So,

1011
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:21,090
but I mean I guess the question is not
to go off on too much of a tangent,

1012
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:22,350
but the question is,

1013
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,040
would you want it to be all peaceful
all the time with no progress?

1014
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:30,990
Would you want that good theoretical
question? Kind of know, right?

1015
01:03:30,991 --> 01:03:34,410
I mean, cause you're kind of thinking
that you're going to think of,

1016
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,420
do you like doing graphic
design on a computer,

1017
01:03:36,421 --> 01:03:39,850
which wouldn't exist if it wasn't
for war? Nope. Who would not say

1018
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:45,510
point taken. But even like
even like competition. Right.
You know, it's like, yeah,

1019
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,450
competition is good. Healthy
competition is good. It's good for you.

1020
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,630
It makes you be, it doesn't feel like
that. Even when you're in the moment,

1021
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:55,140
it's like, let's say you're just
dominating and whatever. I don't know,

1022
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:59,040
you play tennis, I don't know. And you're
killing everyone. You're number one,

1023
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:03,090
you're breaking world records your money
and then you kind of notice this new

1024
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:06,660
young, hungry guy coming in. He starts
breaking your, some of your records,

1025
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,330
you're like, you don't like that
you, that makes you kind of mad.

1026
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:13,380
You kind of wish that never happened in,
but at the same time,

1027
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:16,230
that usually is a catalyst for
you to start working harder. Sure.

1028
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,440
In preparing for that young,
I'm all about it. Yeah. So,

1029
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:22,920
but you're going to cut and you like
the, the head to head, you know,

1030
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:26,940
like you'd like that. Yeah.
Like the competition. Yeah.
You like directly though,

1031
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,580
you know, like when you say
when I think anyway, it wasn't,

1032
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:32,010
when they say healthy competition is good,

1033
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:34,320
it's the result of healthy
competition is good.

1034
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:38,130
You get the best products right in the
market or whatever and that's a result.

1035
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:41,010
That's why it's good. That's why it's
kind of empirically good. Ultimately.

1036
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,640
I agree. Sure. It's not a
perfect process. You know?

1037
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:49,200
And I know you're on the fence of,
I know, but, but you, you like,

1038
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:53,700
like if I came up and you could tell I
was feeling good, that would make you,

1039
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,400
that wouldn't make you nervous.
You'd be happy. You'd be like,

1040
01:04:56,401 --> 01:05:00,120
you like that head to head. It felt you
were feeling good about what? Come on.

1041
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:03,210
Let's face it on the mat.
Oh, on the mats of justice.

1042
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:08,220
If you come up to me and
you're all excited or even
give me the Echo Charles Kao.

1043
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:14,130
Okay. Cause I just played
that through my mind. Yeah.

1044
01:05:14,131 --> 01:05:16,950
When I see you like that, I'm
like, oh yeah, it's even more on.

1045
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,140
And so I'll even put it more accurately,
more extreme,

1046
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:22,870
more understandable as far
as what I think you're like,

1047
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:26,710
so let's say we went enrolled in, I tapped
you out all right. For the first time.

1048
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:31,390
Sure you wouldn't like,
you wouldn't like that specific thing,

1049
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,620
but when we roll again, that's when
you'd be at your happiest right there.

1050
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:40,690
That's what I think. Like I think most
of us, you, you want more of a challenge.

1051
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,010
Yeah,
like all of that.

1052
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:47,200
It's really on now that moment to you
is a very pleasurable moment is what it

1053
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:50,200
seems like. For some people,
like from, I don't know.

1054
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,330
I would even argue for like
a lot of people like that.

1055
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,330
I mean maybe that's a good example,
maybe not,

1056
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:58,310
but that moment usually is a very
stressful moment. Like, Dang,

1057
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:00,520
I know I got to deal with this now.
You know,

1058
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:03,520
and sure it will result in
the way better stuff for sure.

1059
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,760
But the moment is less embraced men on
normal people people should pay attention

1060
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:10,960
to too is

1061
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,450
the thing that bothers people. Again,
topic we've talked about before.

1062
01:06:16,451 --> 01:06:20,650
The thing that bothers people is
the anticipation of the situation.

1063
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,590
But most people like you,

1064
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:28,150
you like we were talking about you
making videos earlier when you know,

1065
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,980
like there's a muster
common in your by like, oh,

1066
01:06:29,981 --> 01:06:34,210
I got to do this video that
I would imagine hangs over
your head more than when

1067
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:35,044
you actually are all right,

1068
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:37,520
now you're doing the work and
you're putting it together
and it's getting dialed.

1069
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:40,690
Yes, true. That's how I feel about
things. You know, I'll be like,

1070
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,570
there's something that I got to do
and I'm like, oh, it's like, ah,

1071
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:45,160
you know what you do,
you attack that thing.

1072
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:50,830
And now when you talked to me earlier
about working out and like, Hey,

1073
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:55,420
do you ever just call it? What I
will do, which is major weakness,

1074
01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:00,100
is I'll, I'll like, I'll like,
wait, I'll, I'll, I'll pace, I've,

1075
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:04,570
I've posted this on Twitter
before. Like, Yo, I hemmed and
Hawed, I, I re I, you know,

1076
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:07,450
redid the weights,
I vacuum whatever.

1077
01:07:07,451 --> 01:07:11,410
I'm taking all kinds of reasons
to not start procrastinating it.

1078
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:14,980
I'm going to do it, I'm gonna
make myself do it. But I'm just,

1079
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,620
I'm just like being such a baby,

1080
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,260
but I do that 200% and
I'm not talking hours,

1081
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,710
but it's there in 20 minutes,
you know, 20 minutes of like,

1082
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:31,300
you don't want a better stretch out
more. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's weak.

1083
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:37,660
Weak. Do it. Just do it. That's the
thing that you know what you don't want.

1084
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,200
That's one thing I'll tell you.
Two Little Wah.

1085
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,860
This is a workout tip from Jocko Day.
You Do,

1086
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:48,670
you put a stopwatch on stuff. Even when
I'm doing something that's not really,

1087
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,660
even when I'm doing something that's
not really focused on the time,

1088
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,530
I at least put a stopwatch on it so
that I just gotta keep, you know,

1089
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,081
you just keep,

1090
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:59,650
it just keeps it on paceman cause
otherwise that feeling that I just talked

1091
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:04,150
about, we'll, we'll start
finding itself in between sets.

1092
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,430
You know what makes it good?
Yeah. It's weird thing.

1093
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,900
I'd mentioned this workout that I started
a long time never really deviated,

1094
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:17,450
dealt with for it's, it has rest
between sets as part of the workout.

1095
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:21,930
The time designated times.
Designated time. Yeah. It was
always, I don't think, man,

1096
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:22,730
I it,

1097
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,330
I cannot think of a time where it ever
worked out where the time between the

1098
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:29,750
sets was just like ambiguous or something.
It was always a specific time.

1099
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,880
So that little procrastination thing
would creep up between exercises or,

1100
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,680
or before my first set,

1101
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:40,520
you know your warm up and the first
sets of usually the heaviest for me too.

1102
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:44,210
So I'm like, all right, all right. And
that'll happen. But you're right though,

1103
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,500
like if you watch on it,

1104
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:50,740
I have this one workout that I do where
I do like it's Elsa's pull ups and then

1105
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:55,880
talk pull ups and then dead hang pull
ups and then kipping pull ups and then

1106
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:56,450
Chin ups.

1107
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:59,540
So it's like those five and you do as
many as you can in each and then you,

1108
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,610
then I do something else in that
I'd come back and do it again.

1109
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:06,350
I do like five rounds of that. So
they're like burnout sets each one. Okay.

1110
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:10,760
And like the first time I did I was like,
oh that was cool.

1111
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,290
And so when the first time I did
it, you know, I was kind of um,

1112
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,940
let's just say motivated to do it.

1113
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:19,820
That was kind of fired up and
this was years and years ago.

1114
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,710
And then the next time I did it,

1115
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:26,450
it took me a really long time and I
realized because I just was taking a long

1116
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:28,850
time between sets,
that's not the purpose of it.

1117
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,280
So now I always put a stopwatch
on that thing. Yeah, keep, keep,

1118
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:35,230
keep the clock ticking and that's it.

1119
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,910
And you feel it because you feel the
clock ticking, you know, you're like,

1120
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:41,810
oh my God, I guess that that would apply
to everything. Huh? Like you'd like,

1121
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:45,950
if you, and you know, that's why like when
I write, I do a thousand words. You know,

1122
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:47,750
why? Cause it get thousand
words done in an hour.

1123
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:51,440
Sometimes I'm always shooting to see if
I can get it done in 50 minutes. Wait,

1124
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:54,890
wait. So you will, let's say when you
write, you do, boom, you set the clock,

1125
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,420
your time, your watch. I
don't set my watch. Yeah,

1126
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,440
it's, you know, eight 48. Okay.
Nine 48 I'm going to be done.

1127
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,660
I'm gonna wrap this. I can,
because that's even worse.

1128
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:13,190
You sit there and stare at a blank screen
or you click on that little on that

1129
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:17,390
little internet browser
thing at the bottom.

1130
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:21,020
Then there you go. You're going down
that slippery slope. Don't do it.

1131
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,110
I'll do it.
Check

1132
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,510
talking about the general
a little bit more.

1133
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,920
If therefore he finds his army composed
of raw troops or if they have been long

1134
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:38,000
on, long been unaccustomed to fighting.
He must carefully study the strength,

1135
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:38,750
the spirit,

1136
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:43,370
the manners of each particular legion
and of each body of auxiliaries,

1137
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,990
cavalry and infantry.
He must know if possible,

1138
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:51,830
this is good. He must know if possible,
the name and capacity of every count,

1139
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,630
Tribune,
sub alternate soldier.

1140
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:59,890
He must assume the most respectable
of fordy and maintain it by severity.

1141
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:07,180
He must punish all military crimes
with the greatest rigor of the laws.

1142
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,170
So there's a dichotomy there.

1143
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,950
He's saying you should know the name
of every single person on your team.

1144
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,930
At the same time,
if they get out of line,

1145
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:19,110
you maintain by severity.

1146
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,233
Hmm.

1147
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:27,520
For troops that have never been an action
or have not for some time been used to

1148
01:11:27,521 --> 01:11:28,810
such spectacles.

1149
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:33,430
Been used to such spectacles are greatly
shocked at the site of the wounded and

1150
01:11:33,431 --> 01:11:36,780
dying and the impressions
of fear they receive,

1151
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:40,600
dispose them rather to fly than to fight.

1152
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:50,160
That's again to me is how to you train
people and get them used to what they're

1153
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:55,100
going to be facing in the real world.
Always keep that in mind as a leader,

1154
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:58,400
and I was about to say, almost keep,
always keep that in mind as a trainer,

1155
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,800
but as a, as a leader, guess
what you are. You're the trainer.

1156
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:01,783
Hmm.

1157
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:09,660
Having explained the less considerable
branches of the art of war, the mill,

1158
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:14,310
the order of military affairs naturally
leads us to the general engagement.

1159
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,050
So now he's up to this point.

1160
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:18,660
He's only been talking about
how to get ready for war.

1161
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:24,530
This is a conjecture full of uncertainty
and fatal to Kingdoms and nations for

1162
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:25,800
indecision.

1163
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:30,570
In the decision of a pitched battle
consist the fullness of victory

1164
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:36,690
troops must never be engaged in a general
action immediately after a long march

1165
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,030
when the men are fatigued
and the horses tired,

1166
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:43,380
the strength required for action
is spent in the toil of the march.

1167
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:47,730
What can a soldier do?
Who charges when out of breath?

1168
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,430
Sure, everyone's going to hit
me up. See, you need more rest.

1169
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,453
Hmm hmm.

1170
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,860
And he goes on to a little,
a little get after it right here.

1171
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:03,640
The sentiments of the troops
should be determined before battle.

1172
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:07,180
It is necessary to know the sediments
of the soldiers on the day of the

1173
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:08,014
engagement.

1174
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,800
Their confidence or apprehensions
are easily discovered by their looks,

1175
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:14,230
their words, their
actions, and their motions.

1176
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:19,300
No great dependence is to be placed
on the eagerness of young soldiers for

1177
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:20,800
action,
for fighting.

1178
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:25,801
Has some thing agreeable in the idea
to those who are strangers to it.

1179
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,050
So he's saying the young soldiers that
hadn't been a war that are all fired up

1180
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:31,470
the fight,

1181
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:36,470
don't listen to him because there's some
agreeable in the idea of fighting to

1182
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:39,570
people that haven't done it before.
And then he says, on the other hand,

1183
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:44,100
it would be wrong to hazard into an
engagement if the old experienced soldiers

1184
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:47,070
testify a discussion of a declination,

1185
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:51,990
a disinclination to fight.
So if the,

1186
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:57,000
if the old guys are like, Hey, this boss
not a good idea, pay attention. A general,

1187
01:13:57,001 --> 01:14:01,620
however main courage and animate his
troops by proper exhortations and

1188
01:14:01,621 --> 01:14:06,000
harangues, especially if by his
account of the approaching action,

1189
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:09,660
he can persuade them into the
belief of an easy victory.

1190
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:12,100
With this

1191
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,670
view,

1192
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:16,180
he should lay before them the cowardice
or unskilled fullness of their enemies

1193
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:19,570
and remind them of any former advantages
they may have gained over them.

1194
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,070
He should employ every argument
capable of exciting rage, hatred,

1195
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,790
and indignation against the adversaries
in the minds of his soldiers.

1196
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:32,470
Now this is something I disagree with.
I disagree with this idea.

1197
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:37,830
I disagree with the idea of telling the
troops that it's going to be an easy

1198
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:43,120
victory of telling the troops
that, hey, they're cowards.

1199
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,510
I don't agree with that.
And because when you do that,

1200
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:50,710
there's a lot of things that
can go bad. Uh, number one,

1201
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:56,080
when you go against the enemy and you
face him and they start doing good against

1202
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:59,990
you because they're more skilled than
you expected, that's a problem. Yeah,

1203
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,330
I can jam up your morale. All that
can jam up your morale really bad.

1204
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,770
So I don't recommend ever
disrespecting the enemy.

1205
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:11,290
I recommend you give them a full,
not to mention if hey,

1206
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:15,730
this can be an easy victory. What's
your mindset going into it? I mean,

1207
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:17,230
first of all,
you're not training hard for it.

1208
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,740
You think you're going to win and easy
it's called. Yeah, don't do that. No, you,

1209
01:15:20,741 --> 01:15:22,330
you,
you respect the enemy.

1210
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:26,530
I think the point that he may have been
trying to make is like don't be afraid

1211
01:15:26,531 --> 01:15:29,710
of the enemy. I get that. Nothing
to be afraid of, but respect him.

1212
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:34,840
Didn't Frederick the great say
something like the last last time,

1213
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:38,540
like something about remind them of
how lame they are or whatever. Um,

1214
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:44,140
he did say something like
that and actually it just,

1215
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:49,060
the thing that he was saying,
what was it that he said

1216
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:52,720
he,
he was saying no.

1217
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:57,220
What he was saying was only talk
about the enemy with total score.

1218
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,400
That's what he was when we talk
about the enemy with total score,

1219
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:03,730
and actually he was also saying like you
shouldn't even hate the enemy but don't

1220
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,140
let anyone know that you don't hate her.

1221
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,040
Which was kind of interesting and he's
saying the same thing like rage and

1222
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:12,550
hatred and indignation. That's how you
want them to be thinking of the enemy.

1223
01:16:12,551 --> 01:16:14,020
So they both agreed on that point,

1224
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:18,640
but I disagree on the point of tell the
tell your men that this is going to be

1225
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:21,000
an easy fight because there's not
going to be an easy fight. Yeah.

1226
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,211
Back to the book.

1227
01:16:24,211 --> 01:16:29,190
It is natural for men in general to be
affected with some sensations of fear at

1228
01:16:29,191 --> 01:16:32,400
the beginning of an engagement.
But there are without a doubt,

1229
01:16:32,401 --> 01:16:37,401
some of a more to Morris disposition who
are disordered by the very sight of the

1230
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:44,820
enemy to diminish these apprehensions
before you venture on action,

1231
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
draw up your army frequently in order
of battle in some safe situation so that

1232
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:54,150
your men may be accustomed to the
site and appearance of the enemy when

1233
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,140
opportunity offers,

1234
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:00,240
they should be sent to fall upon them
and endeavored to put them to flight or

1235
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,200
kill some of their men.

1236
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:02,870
Okay.

1237
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:07,070
Thus they will become acquaintanced with
their customs arms and horses and the

1238
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:12,130
objects with which we once familiarized
are no longer capable of inspiring us

1239
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,773
with terror.

1240
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,660
It's amazing how good you get at something
like if you've seen it one time. Yeah.

1241
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,720
You know, and just, just think
about any situation. Think if,

1242
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:27,890
if like if you scare someone,

1243
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:29,920
which I enjoy scaring people sir.

1244
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:33,620
But if you scare someone and then they
come back in and you try and do the same

1245
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:37,310
thing, it's like they're not
scared at all. It doesn't work. So,

1246
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,770
so that's what, that's how you want to
prepare your people. You get them used to.

1247
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:46,640
Those seeing what they're
going to see. Yeah. Good.

1248
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:50,930
Generals are acutely aware that victory
depends much on the nature of the field

1249
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:51,764
of battle

1250
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:58,150
when you intend therefore to engage
endeavor to draw the chief advantage from

1251
01:17:58,151 --> 01:18:02,200
your situation.
The highest ground is reckoned the best.

1252
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:03,640
Always take the high ground

1253
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,100
talking about reserves,

1254
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:17,570
the method of having bodies of reserves
in the rear of the enemy army composed

1255
01:18:17,571 --> 01:18:18,051
of choice,

1256
01:18:18,051 --> 01:18:23,051
infantry and cavalry commanded by the
supernumerary lieutenant generals counts

1257
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:30,070
and tribunes is very judicious and of
great consequence toward the gaining of a

1258
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:31,280
battle.

1259
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,550
Some should be posted in the rear of
the wings and some near the center to be

1260
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:38,510
ready to fly immediately to the
assistance of any part of the line,

1261
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:40,010
which is hard pressed to prevent.

1262
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:45,040
It's being pierced to supply the vacancies
made therein during the action and

1263
01:18:46,911 --> 01:18:51,080
thereby to keep up the courage of
their fellow soldiers and check the

1264
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,510
impetuosity of the enemy.

1265
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:55,760
Okay,

1266
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,370
so always have reserves.
Don't overextend yourself.

1267
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:05,360
The post of the commander in chief is
generally on the right between the cavalry

1268
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:09,230
and the infantry.
Fraught for from this place,

1269
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:14,231
he can best direct the motions of the
whole army and move elements with the

1270
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:16,430
greatest of ease wherever
he finds necessary.

1271
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:21,470
It is also the most convenient spot to
give his orders to both horse and foot

1272
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,920
and animate them equally by his presence.

1273
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:26,870
So position yourself in a good spot.

1274
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:32,783
Okay.

1275
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:39,370
And able general never loses a favorable
opportunity of surprising the enemy

1276
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:43,730
either when tired on the march
divided in the passage of a river,

1277
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,650
embarrassed in a morasses,

1278
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:49,010
struggling with the Dick
clarities of mountains,

1279
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:51,320
wind dispersed over the country,

1280
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:55,490
they think themselves and security
or are sleeping in their quarters.

1281
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:01,350
So just take advantage of your enemy
whenever they let their guard down.

1282
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,510
In all these cases,

1283
01:20:03,511 --> 01:20:08,220
the adversaries are surprised
and destroyed before they
time to put themselves

1284
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,293
on their guard.

1285
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:14,400
But if they are too
cautious and you and give,

1286
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:16,400
yeah,

1287
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:21,050
but if they are too cautious to give
you an opportunity of surprising or

1288
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:21,890
ensnaring them,

1289
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:26,720
you are then obliged to engage
openly and on equal terms.

1290
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:30,500
So whenever you get the chance,
you, you sucker punch him.

1291
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,030
Right. You know, is that the,

1292
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,440
is that, am I encouraging you go
out in soccer punch people know.

1293
01:20:39,441 --> 01:20:43,460
But if you're going to fight,
take advantage of the situation,

1294
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:46,190
you've already determined that
the enemy that needs to be fought,

1295
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,960
you're going to do everything you can to,

1296
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,970
but isn't that you've got going anything.

1297
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,560
I just started a rash of sucker punches.
No,

1298
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,380
I feel like you misused the expression.

1299
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:01,410
That's what I think from cause sucker
punch is more of a waging of war or a

1300
01:21:01,661 --> 01:21:05,500
certain level of war. When someone, and
you're saying these are already at war,

1301
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,640
they're already at war now it's like it's
Kinda sucker punches the kind of, hey,

1302
01:21:09,641 --> 01:21:13,540
we're just going to go invade
this country. They have no
idea that were, you know,

1303
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:17,500
they don't know kind of their citizens
said something bad about our president or

1304
01:21:17,501 --> 01:21:18,334
something like that.

1305
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,270
But if you guys are in war and they
are sleeping or something like that,

1306
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,133
oh no man.

1307
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:27,760
That's good. Okay. I agree. No, I
actually agree with you very much.

1308
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:30,580
Very strongly. I think you're
correct. Yeah. In fact,

1309
01:21:30,581 --> 01:21:34,870
I don't think you should soccer
punch anyone. Yes, I agree.

1310
01:21:34,871 --> 01:21:39,570
You shouldn't soccer punch someone, but
if you are at war with someone, yes,

1311
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:44,570
then you're trying to get them at their
least prepared situation. Yes, I agree.

1312
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,270
Thousand percent all
right. This is important.

1313
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:52,060
The flight of an enemy
should not be prevented,

1314
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:57,400
but facilitated generals unskilled in war,

1315
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,410
think of victory,
incomplete.

1316
01:21:59,411 --> 01:22:04,120
Unless the enemy are so straightened in
their ground or so entirely surrounded

1317
01:22:04,121 --> 01:22:08,680
by numbers as to they have
no possibility of escape.

1318
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:13,860
But in such situation
where no hope remains,

1319
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:18,980
fear itself will arm an enemy and despair
inspires courage as powerful as you

1320
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,110
think about that fear itself, alarm the
enemy if you surround them completely.

1321
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:28,740
When men find themselves,
oh sorry.

1322
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,710
When men find they must inevitably parish,

1323
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:37,400
they willingly resolve to die with
their comrades and with their arms,

1324
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:38,763
their hands,

1325
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:46,430
the maximum that a golden bridge should
be made for a flying enemy has much been

1326
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:50,880
commended for when they
have free room to escape.

1327
01:22:50,881 --> 01:22:55,650
They think of nothing but how to save
themselves by flights and the confusion

1328
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:58,590
that you might think that you might
think by that statement. He say, hey leg,

1329
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:01,000
you build the Golden Bridge
for them to get away. Yeah.

1330
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:05,530
You might think that that's
sort of a a merciful to do,

1331
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:10,590
but check out this line and
the confusion becoming general.

1332
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,450
Great numbers are cut to pieces.

1333
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,250
The pursuers can be in no danger when the
vanquished have thrown away their arms

1334
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:21,670
for greater haste. So an area guys are
dropping their swords, they see an escape,

1335
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:24,130
they dropped their swords and
they run for it. But you got them,

1336
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,440
you're waiting there for him.
In this case,

1337
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,830
the greater number of the flying enemy,
the greater the slaughter.

1338
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:31,360
Yeah.

1339
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:36,360
Numbers are of no signification where
troops once thrown into consternation are

1340
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:41,680
equally terrified at the site
of the enemy as their weapons.

1341
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,070
Yeah,

1342
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:46,760
so that's good advice.
And that's,

1343
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:52,340
this is something as well, you
know, I, it's not the same thing,

1344
01:23:52,341 --> 01:23:54,640
but man, when you, when you do,

1345
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,100
when you're dealing with another
human being and let's say,

1346
01:23:58,101 --> 01:24:01,940
let's say you and I are talking about
something and I know I'm right and I know

1347
01:24:01,941 --> 01:24:04,280
you're wrong,
but you kind of planted yourself into it.

1348
01:24:04,281 --> 01:24:06,250
You kind of painted yourself
into a corner. Yeah.

1349
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,340
I'll give you a little out and
give you a little while. You know,

1350
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:11,270
I don't want to like,
I want to do that to you.

1351
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,880
I don't want to do that
to be hard work with, no,

1352
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,250
let me give you a little out like oh yeah.
It's probably the way it used to be,

1353
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:19,460
but you know what, hey, you know, it's a
little subtle where you like, yeah, yeah.

1354
01:24:19,461 --> 01:24:22,700
You know, definitely I've done it before
I call. That's cool. I'm glad it worked.

1355
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:27,050
You know, we think of this so
it gives good a little out.

1356
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:32,120
That actually is very, very, um,
it's not, it's a nice thing to do,

1357
01:24:32,121 --> 01:24:36,830
but it feels very smart.
Very smart.

1358
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,970
It's very smart to do you give people a
little out. Yeah. I have to do that with,

1359
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,360
I have to do that with a, I
have to, my kids, you know,

1360
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,120
I'm a little out cause
they'll paint themselves in a
corner because they're kids,

1361
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:52,730
you know? That's what they did. They just
ask what they do. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh,

1362
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:55,160
when you embarrass somebody,
cause that's kind of embarrassing,

1363
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:58,640
especially when you get into some
argument where it turns into me and so you

1364
01:24:58,641 --> 01:25:00,830
kind of thing, then you realize
you're wrong and you're like, Oh man,

1365
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:05,410
I have to basically wow. I, yeah, give
them, let me give out. So we're kind of,

1366
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:09,520
we're both winters can be good cause
my ego's not involved over here on this

1367
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:12,920
happy that we can get along and
moving forward. Yeah. Good with it.

1368
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,440
Back to the book in the first place,

1369
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:23,160
your men must not imagine that
you retired to decline in action,

1370
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:28,550
but believe you retreat and artifice to
draw the enemy in to a more advantageous

1371
01:25:30,361 --> 01:25:35,340
position for you where you may more
easily defeat them in case they follow you

1372
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:41,370
for troops, you perceive their
general despairs of success are prone,

1373
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,100
prone to flight.
So what that saying is,

1374
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:45,610
and I should have given
this introduction before,

1375
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:49,320
is that if you feel like
you have to retreat,

1376
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,660
you don't say, hey, we're, we're,

1377
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:54,120
we're getting crushed here and we're
going to retreat. What we say is, hey,

1378
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,373
we're going to bait them,

1379
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:59,460
we're going to move back and we're going
to draw that men. So the guys go, oh,

1380
01:25:59,461 --> 01:26:01,830
okay, I get it. If you're just like, hey,

1381
01:26:01,831 --> 01:26:04,220
we're getting our asses kicked
and we need to get out of here,

1382
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,460
you're going to lose. Your
people are going to run away.
But if you're like, hey,

1383
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,290
we're doing this maneuver,
we're going to fade back a little bit,

1384
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,180
we're going to set him up and he'll go,
oh cool,

1385
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:15,050
I'm gonna get an opportunity for payback.
So that's a good point.

1386
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,310
Very good point.

1387
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:19,500
It seems like their mindset would
still be in the fight in that case.

1388
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:23,600
[inaudible] versus [inaudible].
Exactly.

1389
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:28,700
You keep them in the
fight. It's exactly. Now,

1390
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,030
once people once it,

1391
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:34,580
once the enemy is fleeing and you
chase them, you gotta be careful.

1392
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:35,420
Back to the book,

1393
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:40,420
a ration inconsiderate pursuit exposes
an army to the greatest danger possible.

1394
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:45,590
That a falling into ambush and
bushes and the hands of the troops,

1395
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,900
enemy troops ready for their reception,

1396
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:54,640
for as in the term temerity of an army
is increased and their caution lessened

1397
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,500
by the pursuit of a flying enemy.

1398
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,880
This is most favorable
opportunity for such snares.

1399
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:04,250
So when you get somebody running after
you, that's when you can catch him.

1400
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,540
The greater the security,

1401
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:13,270
the greater the danger troops
when unprepared at their meals,

1402
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:17,170
fatigued after march when their
horses are feeding. And in short,

1403
01:27:17,171 --> 01:27:19,330
when they believed themselves,
most security,

1404
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:23,500
the most secure are generally
most liable to a surprise.

1405
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:28,870
All risks of this sort are to be avoided
carefully and all opportunities taken

1406
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,930
of distressing the enemy by such methods.

1407
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:37,970
So that mindset that people get,
like you just said,

1408
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,020
when they're running away is one thing.
But also when they think they just one,

1409
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:43,580
they get the mindset of like,
oh,

1410
01:27:43,581 --> 01:27:48,020
we don't need security anywhere anymore
right now. We don't need it. We're good

1411
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,980
there. That one little line,
the greater the security,

1412
01:27:54,981 --> 01:27:58,370
the greater the danger that that line
right there, it doesn't make any sense.

1413
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:02,220
The greater the security, the great
danger. What he's saying is when the,

1414
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:07,410
the greater the security is the greater
the danger of being susceptible to

1415
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,960
letting your guard down.
Yeah.

1416
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:14,720
Like if it name MMA situation,

1417
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:18,740
they got the idea we talked about
before, but yeah, you've got them days,

1418
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,920
days and they're like, well I'm going
to go either to the finish all crazy,

1419
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,420
not like as cautious as maybe they should
be. Kind of that situation for sure.

1420
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:29,060
He's talking about the greater of
the security. So the better you feel,

1421
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:33,140
right does it, your said,
I keep losing that line.

1422
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,860
The greater the security,
the greater the danger that the security,

1423
01:28:36,861 --> 01:28:41,420
the greater the danger. That's what it is.
So when you're feeling secure, watch it.

1424
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:46,040
Watch yourself
resources in case of defeat.

1425
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:50,180
If while one part of your army is
victorious, the other should be defeated.

1426
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:54,560
You are by no means to despair.
Since even in this extremity,

1427
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:59,390
the constancy and resolution of a
general may recover a complete victory.

1428
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:02,010
So just cause you

1429
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,930
take a little loss doesn't mean
you're going to lose completely.

1430
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:08,550
Yet not withstanding an entire defeat,
all possible remedies must be attempted.

1431
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:13,230
Since many generals have been fortunate
enough to repair such a loss so you can

1432
01:29:13,231 --> 01:29:17,610
always come back and army after
a defeat has sometimes rallied,

1433
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:18,990
returned on the enemy,

1434
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:24,080
dispersed him by pursuing an order
and destroyed him without difficulty.

1435
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,410
Nor can men be in a more
dangerous situation.

1436
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:32,490
Then when in the midst
of joy after victory,

1437
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,630
there exfiltration is suddenly
converted into terror.

1438
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,970
So same thing,

1439
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:48,580
you're joyous cause you one and
all of a sudden you're the tables,

1440
01:29:48,581 --> 01:29:50,440
turn whatever be the event.

1441
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:53,530
The remains of the army must
be immediately assembled.

1442
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,980
Reanimated by suitable exhortations
and furnished with fresh,

1443
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:01,690
fresh supplies of arms. That's what
you do when you get a good victory.

1444
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:04,000
You're like, all right, reload.
That's what we're doing right now.

1445
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,380
And in this last section of the book,
he,

1446
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:16,830
he kind of just breaks down and sums up
the rest of the book that we just read.

1447
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:21,760
Hmm. So these are all pretty
familiar. Most of them, cause we,

1448
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:22,900
I covered most of them.

1449
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:25,813
Okay.

1450
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:27,800
It is the nature of war,

1451
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:32,300
that what is beneficial to you is
detrimental to the enemy and what is of

1452
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:34,550
service to him always hurts you.

1453
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:36,320
Okay.

1454
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,520
That seems like common
sense. Yes. The more troops,

1455
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:46,930
the more your troops had been accustomed
to camp duties on frontier stations and

1456
01:30:47,091 --> 01:30:49,250
the more carefully they
have been disciplined,

1457
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:53,510
the less danger they will
be exposed to in the field.

1458
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:56,123
Yeah.

1459
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,473
Train them hard.

1460
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,900
Men must be sufficiently tried before
they are let against the enemy.

1461
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,920
Train them hard. It is much better
to overcome the enemy by famine,

1462
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,720
surprise or terror.

1463
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:11,040
Then my general actions
for in the latter instance,

1464
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:14,640
fortune has often a
greater share than valor.

1465
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:19,770
I like the idea of overcoming
the enemy just by terror.

1466
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:25,800
Just just, I wish there was like a, a
full chapter about that. That's legit.

1467
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:29,760
Those designs are best,

1468
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:34,590
which the enemy are entirely ignorant
of till the moment of execution.

1469
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:39,360
Opportunity in war is often more
to be depended on than courage.

1470
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,233
Okay.

1471
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:50,880
To departure to the botch
the enemy soldiers and
encouraged them when sincere in

1472
01:31:51,191 --> 01:31:56,191
surrendering themselves is have a special
service for an adversary is more hurt

1473
01:31:56,561 --> 01:31:58,390
by desertion than my slaughter.

1474
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,030
So if you get the enemy to
like come over to your side,

1475
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:06,100
that's even worse to the enemy then
when you're just killing him because you

1476
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:07,690
think about when you're
getting your friends killed,

1477
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:09,760
you have some kind of vengeance.
Yeah,

1478
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:13,270
but if they just take your friends and
then like all in the, in the back room,

1479
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:17,720
having them having a glass of wine with,
you know, you're like, okay, I'm going.

1480
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,360
If that sounds better than the deal I got,

1481
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:27,360
it is better to have several bodies of
reserves then to extend yourself too much

1482
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:29,020
to the front.
There you go.

1483
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:35,310
A general is not easily overcome who can
form a true judgment of his own and the

1484
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:40,720
enemy forces. We've been hearing
that one since Sun Tzu art of war.

1485
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:43,960
Valor is superior to numbers.

1486
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:45,600
Okay?

1487
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,050
The nature of ground is often have
more consequences than courage.

1488
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,960
These guys talking about terrain,
that's what he's talking about.

1489
01:32:51,961 --> 01:32:54,990
So everyone that's in the military, listen
to this right now. Terrain, terrain,

1490
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:56,730
terrain.
Learn to read the terrain.

1491
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:58,950
Okay,

1492
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:03,760
this is a good one. A few men
are born brave. Many becomes.

1493
01:33:03,761 --> 01:33:08,280
So through care and force of discipline,

1494
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:10,440
great dichotomy there.

1495
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:15,060
Care for your people and through force
of discipline is what makes people brave.

1496
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:16,283
Hmm.

1497
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:22,260
In army is strengthened by labor

1498
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,920
and weakened by idleness.

1499
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:35,150
Don't sit around, don't
sit around. Keep moving.

1500
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,980
Troops are not to be led to battle
and less confident of success.

1501
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:44,930
Novelty and surprise.
Throw an enemy into consternation,

1502
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:47,570
but common incidents have no effect.

1503
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:55,330
Learn new moves.
That's some advice I need to take.

1504
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,820
I always do the same moves,
not good.

1505
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:04,080
He who rashly pursues a flying enemy
with troops in disorder seems inclined to

1506
01:34:05,171 --> 01:34:09,310
resign that victory which
he had before obtained.

1507
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:14,530
So if, if you go pursuing the enemy
when your troops aren't organized,

1508
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,810
you're basically trying to
give away your victory. Hmm.

1509
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,210
So be careful when you pursue

1510
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:25,290
an army on supplied with grain and other
necessary provisions will be vanquished

1511
01:34:25,291 --> 01:34:29,680
without striking a blow. I need
to, when do you find, sorry,

1512
01:34:29,681 --> 01:34:31,260
I looked around and looking for like a,

1513
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,260
like a Roman soldier and they
find some letters and stuff.

1514
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:38,400
But these guys must have been hungry
talking about all the talking about the

1515
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:39,243
hunger.

1516
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,200
Okay.

1517
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,320
On finding the enemy has
notice of your designs.

1518
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:48,470
You must immediately alter
your plan of operations. Check,

1519
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:53,090
consult with many on proper
measures to be taken,

1520
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:58,130
but communicate the plans you intend to
put an execution too few and only those

1521
01:34:58,131 --> 01:35:03,131
of the most assured fidelity or
rather trust no one but yourself.

1522
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:08,300
Hmm. Interesting. Consult many people.
Yeah. Get some feedback from everyone.

1523
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:15,100
Next punishment and fear thereof are
necessary to keep soldiers in order in

1524
01:35:16,521 --> 01:35:17,354
quarters,

1525
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:23,230
but in the field they are more
influenced by hope and rewards.

1526
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,030
Okay.

1527
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:28,110
Oh,
dichotomy for you.

1528
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:34,160
Good officers never engage in general
actions unless induced by opportunity or

1529
01:35:35,671 --> 01:35:37,140
obliged by necessity.

1530
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:39,383
Okay.

1531
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:44,470
To distress the enemy more by famine
than the sword is the mark of consummate

1532
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,820
skill.
And this is actually the last one here.

1533
01:35:49,821 --> 01:35:53,570
Dispositions for action must be
carefully concealed from the enemy,

1534
01:35:53,571 --> 01:35:58,400
lest they should counteract them and
defeat your plans by proper expedience.

1535
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,320
So those,
again,

1536
01:36:02,321 --> 01:36:05,140
I didn't cover all the maximums and the
reason I didn't is cause some of the

1537
01:36:05,141 --> 01:36:06,400
maxims that he talks about are,

1538
01:36:06,730 --> 01:36:11,590
are legitimately ancient
war tactical warfare,

1539
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:14,500
but it's worth getting the books so
you can read those and understand them.

1540
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,630
And he,

1541
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:21,990
he kinda ends this book with a little
note to the emperor of Rome at the time.

1542
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:27,370
And this is how he wraps it up,
how glorious it is.

1543
01:36:27,371 --> 01:36:29,290
Therefore for Your Majesty,

1544
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:33,490
with all these qualifications to unite
the science of war and the art of

1545
01:36:33,491 --> 01:36:38,491
conquest and to convince the world that
by your conduct and courage you are

1546
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,420
equally capable of performing
the duties of the soldier.

1547
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,040
Yeah.

1548
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,510
And the general.

1549
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:49,203
Okay.

1550
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:50,183
I think that's

1551
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:56,890
actually a cool statement to end on
capable of we performing the duties of the

1552
01:36:56,891 --> 01:37:01,300
soldier and the general. So he wraps
up the book with that last dichotomy

1553
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:04,810
and I think that's one of the,

1554
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,110
really one of the most important
qualities for a leader to have.

1555
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,890
And one of the most important
qualities to be able to balance.

1556
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:18,540
And that is to be able to maintain
and lead from the highest position.

1557
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:24,070
And at the same time, never
forget where you came from, right?

1558
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:26,680
You've heard that expression.
You don't forget where you came from.

1559
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:31,420
That's what he's talking about.
And I think for every leader,

1560
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:32,890
what that means

1561
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:39,240
is recognize that you still
have more to learn that,

1562
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:41,520
okay,

1563
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,780
you can still grow, you can still
try and get better. And obviously

1564
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:51,060
that's what we're doing here
is trying to learn

1565
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,100
and trying to keep learning. Sure. He,

1566
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:01,370
and I think that wraps this
up and obviously we make
this podcast so that we can

1567
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:06,360
learn and other people can
learn if they want to join in.

1568
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:09,480
If you learn anything and you want to,

1569
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:12,690
you don't give this podcast some support.

1570
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:15,780
There's a great ways to do it.

1571
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:20,810
And the goal when you support the podcast
is that you also support yourself.

1572
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,000
That's, that's, that's the goal.

1573
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:28,620
Mutually supporting situation is
what we're going for. So first off,

1574
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:33,690
we got our company up in Maine,
up in New England origin USA

1575
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:38,900
in Farmington, Maine. A hundred percent
American made products products.

1576
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:40,850
Okay.

1577
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:44,390
It's a Jujitsu company, first and
foremost, right? That's the foundation.

1578
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,510
These yes, and rash guards. Interestingly,

1579
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:51,980
gies one of the hardest things in
the world to make from scratch,

1580
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,970
and we make them here in America for sure.

1581
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:01,960
A lot of people think they're the best.
That's actually what I think. Yeah. Well,

1582
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:07,820
so it depends on what you mean
by the best. So if you think

1583
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:14,440
that the ones that fit the most
appropriately for Jujitsu [inaudible],

1584
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,660
then yeah, then they're going to
use your g, two g for Jujitsu.

1585
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:22,130
Then another basket of the
best concur if you want.

1586
01:39:22,131 --> 01:39:26,630
Various different weaves, various
different options that happened to me,

1587
01:39:26,631 --> 01:39:27,590
made it in America,

1588
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:32,710
and various perfect blends for washing,

1589
01:39:32,811 --> 01:39:37,470
drying antimicrobials, stuff, you
know, and yeah, they're the best. Yeah.

1590
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:40,550
When you see, what do you remember
the first time you saw dragon?

1591
01:39:40,551 --> 01:39:42,890
We've like with your own
eyes. Yes. Were you impressed?

1592
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:48,250
I was like, it's legitimately, it's,

1593
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,590
it's legitimately impressive.
I actually,

1594
01:39:51,591 --> 01:39:54,500
this is one of the dumbest things I've
ever thought of in my life. All right.

1595
01:39:54,501 --> 01:39:58,850
Lay It on me. When I first saw
dragon, we've, I thought to myself,

1596
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:01,940
it would be cool to get a legit,
cause you know,

1597
01:40:01,941 --> 01:40:04,090
sometimes I got to wear a suit because
I'm going to work with a company or

1598
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,210
something.
I thought to myself,

1599
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:10,180
it would be cool to get a legitimate
suit made out of this dragon dragon we've

1600
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:14,870
seen. Yeah. It took me about 20 minutes
before I realized I was an idiot.

1601
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:18,950
But it's that cool looking. Yeah. Yeah.

1602
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:24,140
And it's that practical. That's
the thing. Yeah. So anyways,

1603
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:27,770
you can get geese, rash
guards, origin main.com.

1604
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:31,970
What else joggers show? Well, okay,

1605
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,110
so you wanted the sh the suit. Sorry
Brad, you said it. So you know, let's say,

1606
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,920
let's talk about it at least a little bit.
You said the soup soup dude,

1607
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:42,980
and you know, okay. You know,
hey, give me dragging. We've suit.

1608
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,100
But they had,

1609
01:40:46,101 --> 01:40:49,660
I've talked about this before where my
favorite shorts are dragging. We've short,

1610
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,860
they were, they don't make
them. Sorry. Not yet. Well,

1611
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,950
so I was talking to Pete about, I don't
know about them and I was like, hey,

1612
01:40:56,951 --> 01:41:01,750
you know, like you should make the jegging
waist and I forget why, but you know,

1613
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:02,590
not,

1614
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:07,590
not now there's other shorts which are
actually could prove more dope check.

1615
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:12,070
You see the Buffy, like
you saw the buttons, right?

1616
01:41:12,071 --> 01:41:15,080
Like for the shorts are these by
that, by their dope. Anyway, so yeah,

1617
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:18,430
there's some joggers, some, you
know, some shirts and whatnot,

1618
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:21,370
some regular apparel or athletic wear.

1619
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,990
But I'm super comfortable.
I'll tell you that as the,

1620
01:41:24,991 --> 01:41:29,991
the self slash whatever proclaimed
Kunstler of comfort I can say is the most

1621
01:41:32,051 --> 01:41:34,270
comfortable stuff you're
ever going to put on.

1622
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:36,670
If you find anything more
comfortable, let me know. We'll see.

1623
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:40,000
Compare apples to apples, but yeah,
some, uh, some good stuff there.

1624
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:41,410
Also some supplements.

1625
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:45,130
Mm. And you know, speaking
of this, uh, so you know,

1626
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:47,410
you know who doctor
Rhonda Patrick says yes.

1627
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:50,410
She'd been on Joe Rogan a couple of
times. Yeah. Probably even more than that.

1628
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:51,573
Anyways,

1629
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:56,580
she just tweeted out this thing
talking about curcumin and,

1630
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:03,190
well, what is it like, no kidding.
Double and triple whatever. Sure. Tests,

1631
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:05,130
Ucla.
Um,

1632
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:08,650
curcumin is awesome for you and,

1633
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:14,770
but do you remember like what this
is? This is the thing, it blew off.

1634
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,580
The article actually blew off,
wouldn't you?

1635
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:22,030
Like it was like Yacker Q and keeps
down inflammation. That was no big deal.

1636
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:25,810
But actually that's a huge deal. That's
one of the reasons clients enjoy warfare.

1637
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:31,260
But then they did like a test and it
improved memory and like cognitive

1638
01:42:33,971 --> 01:42:37,990
reaction, 28% this is in a lab. And so,

1639
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:43,200
and then they referred to people in India
that people in India who have a high

1640
01:42:43,631 --> 01:42:47,800
level of curcumin in their diets.
That's why Indian food,

1641
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:51,880
it looks yellow is because of that.

1642
01:42:51,881 --> 01:42:53,590
There's one not just like direct,

1643
01:42:53,591 --> 01:42:58,540
but they're saying that's really a
interesting fact. Right? So anyways,

1644
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:01,150
that's in there.
It's in joint warfare.

1645
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:04,410
It's enjoy more than just
joint the Super Krill,

1646
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:07,160
which is Krill oil.
As we all know by now,

1647
01:43:07,161 --> 01:43:12,161
Krill oil is pretty much the best source
of Omega three better than fish oil.

1648
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:16,250
Yes. And we all know fish oil's
good. Krill oils, even better.

1649
01:43:16,251 --> 01:43:19,580
Super Krill oil even better
than regular criminal.

1650
01:43:19,581 --> 01:43:23,840
What the big difference between Super
Krill oil and Krill oil? I do. Yeah,

1651
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,760
it's super.
No,

1652
01:43:25,761 --> 01:43:30,761
but there's been some actual technical
beneficial super stuff and it's like Zen.

1653
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:36,080
It's something,
but it's an [inaudible] not a no.

1654
01:43:36,081 --> 01:43:39,590
It's like Xanthan [inaudible] or
something. Sorry I'm saying it wrong,

1655
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:43,410
but it's an antioxidant, which is
a big deal. You know what? Rust,

1656
01:43:44,090 --> 01:43:48,260
rust, rust, oxidation. Yes.
All that is oxidation of metal.

1657
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:51,770
So when you cause some I didn't,
well I knew for a long time,

1658
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:53,800
but before I knew it, this is
what it is. You know? Well,

1659
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:57,680
how my brain was as far as antioxidants
go, my mom's like, hey, antioxidants.

1660
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:02,660
I'm like, wait, oxidants, oxygen, oxygen,
oxygen. Oxygen is good. We're like,

1661
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:06,300
why is it anti oxygen kind of thing.
It's like, no, it's not anti oxidant.

1662
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,770
Oxidant meaning it fights oxidation,

1663
01:44:09,771 --> 01:44:12,230
which is rust of your body.

1664
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,150
So your body technically is
kind of rusting. You know?

1665
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,490
Antioxidants keeps it from rusting.
So now that you,

1666
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:22,850
when you hear a loyal on your ears,
you hear antioxidants,

1667
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:23,750
that's what you're hearing.

1668
01:44:23,751 --> 01:44:26,660
It's going to keep your body from
rusting straight up. So krill oil,

1669
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:30,980
Omega Three's better uptake than fish
oil. Um, and we need to make many things.

1670
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:35,000
Just know that you need them in this
case for your joints. In other cases,

1671
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:39,950
for your eyeballs, your brain,
your Oregon's, all this stuff.

1672
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:45,040
But know that, just know that it has many
uses plus antioxidants, boom, supercrew.

1673
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:49,700
That's what makes it super. Then
joint warfare, as we mentioned. Yes,

1674
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:53,480
that's for your joints. Curcumin, not
just curcumin. Glucosomine can drain.

1675
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:58,520
These are things, man, I'm telling
you. If you have bad joints, boom,

1676
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:03,470
joint work. Get some
discipline too. But yeah,

1677
01:45:03,471 --> 01:45:07,790
by the way. And so now what we have, as
it turns out, according to Doctor Rhonda,

1678
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:12,520
Patrick, as you said, we have so that
triple stack to each other. Yeah.

1679
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,320
So joint warfare,
Krill oil is the joints,

1680
01:45:15,321 --> 01:45:18,560
but joint warfare also has
cognitive enhancements,

1681
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:21,110
which as does the discipline,

1682
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:26,630
the discipline is like a, what'd you call
it? A powder drink. That's what it is,

1683
01:45:26,631 --> 01:45:29,390
right? Yeah. That's,
I mean, you mix it up.

1684
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:34,060
You put a little on your water bottle
and then it gives you a little bit. Yup.

1685
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:39,770
It gives you that mental edge, uh,
advantage. Uh, Dave Burke sent me a text,

1686
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:44,210
he said, quote, best quote from
the last podcast. Dave Berg.

1687
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:48,740
Cause like a crackhead or something
like that. Sorry Dave. No offense.

1688
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:52,310
Yeah, I know. You're just like
the discipline. Yeah. Hey Man.

1689
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:57,020
Did you see someone posted a picture of
like a guy with like cocaine powder all

1690
01:45:57,021 --> 01:46:01,600
over his face? Yeah, the Dave Chappelle
situation. It's a good marks on

1691
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:07,970
that discipline. Cool.
Well, so mark, okay,

1692
01:46:07,971 --> 01:46:12,680
so that's a little bit of a shifting
gears scenario in regards to supplements.

1693
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:16,250
Milk. Okay. I'm gonna say the
word protein. I said this before.

1694
01:46:16,251 --> 01:46:18,080
I'll say it again cause it,
to me it's appropriate.

1695
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:20,630
I'm going to say the word protein
powder, but I'm not going to say, hey,

1696
01:46:20,631 --> 01:46:23,280
mo is a protein bar.
I'm not going to say that it's not,

1697
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:27,170
it's not appropriate because it's
different. This is how it's different.

1698
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:33,440
It's milk. I just had a
guy hit me up. He said,

1699
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:38,170
I don't drink protein powders, but it
sounds like this is just dessert. Yeah.

1700
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:43,020
And I hate to say it, it's kind of
true kind of things like that too.

1701
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:48,370
But dessert kind of has this like
kind of guilty kind of feel to it.

1702
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:53,280
This is guilt free dessert. Here's
what I did though. I was pushing,

1703
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:57,270
now I know and I was going to kind
of let you know, but I was like, hey,

1704
01:46:57,330 --> 01:47:00,090
you know it just let me just
have it be funny for me.

1705
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:04,290
So I'm thinking literally thinking
of mark while I'm shopping.

1706
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:08,040
So when I shot,
I don't know how much you shop,

1707
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:12,740
but I go in next question and my go tos,

1708
01:47:12,741 --> 01:47:13,920
right to get red leaf lettuce,

1709
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:18,570
eat a lot of red leaf lettuce
for whatever and they get milk.

1710
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:23,190
But this time I'm thinking of the milk.
I don't know why. It was just in my head.

1711
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:25,230
I wasn't going to go drink
some milk at that time.

1712
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:28,860
It was just my head for whatever and
my eyes shifted to chocolate milk.

1713
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:33,210
So I'm like, Hey, what if I
mix the chocolate milk with
the milk? I know, right?

1714
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:38,190
It might be too much do it. No, I didn't
do it. You don't need to. Then again,

1715
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:42,600
why would I knock it before I try it?
Because what if I discover something?

1716
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:45,660
See what I'm saying?
I didn't do it yet.

1717
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:49,250
I'll report back button on
the less it is like a desert,

1718
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,560
but it's one of those beneficial desserts
like not like dark chocolate like you

1719
01:47:53,561 --> 01:47:55,560
know, considered dark chocolate. Right.

1720
01:47:55,561 --> 01:47:58,770
I mean it's a certain percentage rate or
something where it's like good for you.

1721
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,680
Yeah,
got drink and that was kind of like that.

1722
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:04,920
It's like a big milkshake but an egg
in there you really want to get, we'll,

1723
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:09,270
we'll have some milk for sure.
At the immersion camp,

1724
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:13,590
which is by the way,
August 26 that's the one it is.

1725
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:17,650
Last year we didn't have more milk
wasn't even invented yet. Yeah.

1726
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:20,190
It was like straight up.
Didn't exist. Didn't exist.

1727
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:24,990
It was like then all of a sudden you
cracked an atom open and they had to add

1728
01:48:24,991 --> 01:48:29,280
milk to the periodic table. That just
happened last year. I had to drink.

1729
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:33,270
I do drink chocolate milk because they
had it at the camp. Oh, right, right.

1730
01:48:33,271 --> 01:48:36,980
You have to deal like the old school
cafeteria chocolate milk. Just, just,

1731
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:39,940
it's just not, it's just horrible.
You don't like it. I mean,

1732
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:43,140
I think I'm addicted to the experience
because that's what would it had east not

1733
01:48:43,141 --> 01:48:46,350
good. It's not good. So
yeah, immersion camp,

1734
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:51,960
August 26 in September 2nd that's the
last day about this two sessions in there.

1735
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:56,940
I would say, uh, you know, I can't speak
for anyone else. I would say, yeah,

1736
01:48:56,970 --> 01:49:00,120
go to booth because that's good. But
you know, go to one but a two, whatever.

1737
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:03,720
For those that are wondering,
and this isn't confirmed yet,

1738
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:08,250
but we pretty pretty much
had the talk Pete, me and,

1739
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:13,340
and be little and the conversation is
looking like one morning tea afternoon,

1740
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:22,560
Nogi evening, whichever choice. Yeah.

1741
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:25,350
That's like a dream,
isn't it? I think so too.

1742
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:30,120
And I don't have any
complaints from the last one.

1743
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:32,130
Literally I have no complaints.

1744
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:37,560
But I do remember thinking if
there was some Nogi mixed in here,

1745
01:49:37,561 --> 01:49:41,910
this would really, this would make me
kind of not really want to leave you ever.

1746
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:45,630
Yeah. Yeah. This is worth pointing
out. This is the kind of thing that I,

1747
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,330
you, you ever think about
like people that are OCD? Yes.

1748
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:55,530
I think about that all the time.
Right? Obsessively compulsively.

1749
01:49:55,960 --> 01:50:00,000
So sometimes I have a little bit of that,
but one of them is,

1750
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:03,040
is like I want things to be squared away.
Right.

1751
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:05,830
And so when I was going to the camp,
I was kind of like,

1752
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,470
how has this whole laundry thing going
to work? Like what's going to happen?

1753
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:11,260
This was before. Yeah. Well the
thing is just to let everyone know,

1754
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:15,340
if you come to camp, they, they do
laundry, there's like a laundry service.

1755
01:50:15,341 --> 01:50:15,940
It pick it up,

1756
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:20,380
they pick it up and they wash all your
clothes and then they bring back in all

1757
01:50:20,381 --> 01:50:22,810
your clothes nice and clean.
And that's a huge,

1758
01:50:22,811 --> 01:50:27,490
so you think you could basically get
away with two D's? Two Keith? Yeah.

1759
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:32,020
Well maybe three. I, yeah, I
would say, wait, I only had two,

1760
01:50:32,021 --> 01:50:35,340
probably three days. I didn't
bring any geese. I got origin,

1761
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:38,950
I'll bring it to and bottling
them to get there. Yeah. Yeah.

1762
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:40,630
I'm saying to rotate
them through properly,

1763
01:50:40,631 --> 01:50:43,330
but they're pretty fast on its turnaround
anyway. So that's the deal. But the end,

1764
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:46,100
but that's a, that's a, that's
kind of a big deal. The logistics,

1765
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,340
cause there's a difference between,
hey, there's the laundry service, um,

1766
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:52,770
walk across camp to the laundry mat
and go handle your business. Well,

1767
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:56,020
and actually the campus at a
different same lake, echo lake,

1768
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:59,950
but it's a different lake. But, and I
don't know what the exact laundry service.

1769
01:50:59,951 --> 01:51:01,480
I think it's gonna be the
same exact thing though,

1770
01:51:01,481 --> 01:51:03,110
because the service didn't come from Cam.

1771
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:06,370
I somebody that does
laundry for geese makes it,

1772
01:51:06,430 --> 01:51:10,890
there should be people in the world
that just geeky laundry. Keala yeah,

1773
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:14,260
they come and grab it though. They knock
on the door. Like room service. Yeah.

1774
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:18,010
Really? It's a huge deal. I think it's
very convenient. Great. Nice. But yeah,

1775
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:19,360
emerging camp,
August 23rd,

1776
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:24,870
August 26 through September 2nd
two sessions. I'm gonna be there.

1777
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:26,770
Jocko is going to be there.
Rolling.

1778
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:32,820
Rolling to fulfill your curiosity
of how it is to roll with you.

1779
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:39,100
Um, I'm not going to say it'll
be a good time rolling with jock.

1780
01:51:39,101 --> 01:51:41,100
I'm not going to say that like my down my,
yeah,

1781
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:44,320
you might get let down as far
as pleasurable experiences go.

1782
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:47,650
Might let you that mind to bs.
Everyone thinks all he's gotta be stolen.

1783
01:51:47,651 --> 01:51:50,650
Believable? No, it's to come.
Not that good at Jujitsu. Yeah.

1784
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:54,130
I wasn't really thinking that.
I was thinking more. Um Oh yeah,

1785
01:51:54,131 --> 01:51:58,440
that'll be fun and pleasurable.
Meanwhile it'll be like,

1786
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:03,580
like 90% painful and then like
5% embarrassing and you know,

1787
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:08,230
and various other negative emotions.
But yeah, he can, you know, whatever.

1788
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:11,350
If you wonder about that kind of stuff.
I Dunno, maybe you don't, but yeah,

1789
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:15,700
that's in origin also.
We have a store,

1790
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:20,560
actually Jocko has a store
and it's called Jocko store.

1791
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:26,020
Who made that name up? I did
keeping it simple. Anyway,

1792
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:30,190
this is where you can get the rash
guards that we make get after it.

1793
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:34,300
He'll trooper rash guards where
your kid rash guards too by the way,

1794
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:37,660
if we're youth or your
kids getting into Jujitsu,

1795
01:52:37,661 --> 01:52:41,950
boom and for surfing and for whatever,
running, cycling, all that stuff. Um,

1796
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:45,790
and uh,
what other rash guards are there at five?

1797
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:50,750
I was going to make it make sense to
yeah. I stand by it. Get some rash guard.

1798
01:52:50,751 --> 01:52:52,190
That's what I'm going
to make stand by to get.

1799
01:52:52,191 --> 01:52:56,510
So check I was going to make a good
rash guard but then I thought, hey,

1800
01:52:56,511 --> 01:53:01,010
what's the message of good isn't it isn't
standing by to get some too close to

1801
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:03,560
get after it? No. Okay.

1802
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:07,100
Because Stan but now you stand by to get
something is when you're standing by to

1803
01:53:07,101 --> 01:53:10,910
get some getting after it is when
you're actually getting after it.

1804
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,850
So when you're standing by where you're
getting after is two different things.

1805
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:18,080
Completely back to the good rash card is
important I think as far as the layers

1806
01:53:18,081 --> 01:53:22,700
go. Okay, good. Is like when
something quote unquote bad happens,

1807
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:26,420
there's always something good to come
from it. So what you sit to direct quote,

1808
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:32,470
so you can't make him put on a rash
guard that's based on something bad

1809
01:53:32,781 --> 01:53:36,530
happening as far as losing goes or
something like that, right? No. Okay.

1810
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:41,750
I guess you could technically,
if it looked dope, I dunno.
Jury's still out. Anyway,

1811
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:44,030
back to the tee shirt. There's
some corns on there, right?

1812
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:49,280
I just put that diff core on the
tee shirt def. Yeah. Good idea.

1813
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:52,890
I think you're, you're right about
the, a lot hats on there as well.

1814
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:58,190
Two kinds of hats as a, right. Actually
three technically three types of headgear,

1815
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:02,840
trucker hats, flex fit hats, beanies.

1816
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:05,150
Just in time for summer.
It's actually been,

1817
01:54:05,151 --> 01:54:09,620
he's been out for awhile and things
was go give yourself too much credit.

1818
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:14,150
But speaking of summer and winter hoodies,
you'd get hoodies on there too.

1819
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:19,490
Legit hoodies, non Hawaiian hoodies.
You know you're going to make,

1820
01:54:19,491 --> 01:54:21,500
you're going to make a Hawaiian
hoodie apparently. Yeah.

1821
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,750
I think technically there's no
such thing as a plain Hoodie,

1822
01:54:23,751 --> 01:54:28,751
but I will have a lighter weight Hoodie
for when you go to Hawaii and it turns

1823
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:33,410
nighttime and the wind, the breeze
kind of blows and you're like, Dang,

1824
01:54:33,411 --> 01:54:37,100
I wish I had my long sleeve shirt on.
You know, and it'll look kind of don't.

1825
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,980
That's what I think.
That's my whole approach in my opinion.

1826
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:43,270
It's a women's stuff on there too.
Um, you know, for the lady troopers,

1827
01:54:43,271 --> 01:54:48,271
some tank tops and v neck type t shirts
made specifically for the ladies.

1828
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:54,770
Solid discipline equals freedom go down.
Also other ways to support.

1829
01:54:54,771 --> 01:54:56,960
Another way to support
subscribe to the podcast.

1830
01:54:56,990 --> 01:55:01,130
If you haven't already on iTunes and
stitcher and Google play or wherever you

1831
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:05,000
listen to podcasts,
whatever platform you choose to use.

1832
01:55:06,290 --> 01:55:10,350
Also Youtube.
Yeah,

1833
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:12,500
you should subscribe to Youtube.

1834
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:16,790
The reason is so you can see
echoes legit videos. For instance,

1835
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:20,420
you just rereleased one thank God.
Yes,

1836
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:24,350
echo had made a video for
warpath and he put Christmas,

1837
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:27,560
which we all love,
which it was during Christmas time.

1838
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:30,800
And the thing is,

1839
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:34,780
the video is so graphically intense and I,

1840
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,320
I could tell and you had actually
told me that it took days,

1841
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:44,720
days to put together three worth of yeah.

1842
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,760
Film.
And so when you showed it to me,

1843
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:52,670
I was super pumped and then I heard
the music that was super unpolished.

1844
01:55:54,190 --> 01:55:57,120
Yeah,
it was on pumps and anyways,

1845
01:55:57,150 --> 01:56:01,080
he's redone the warpath video
now as good music behind it.

1846
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:05,190
Not Christmas music. We'll
just say revised, revised.

1847
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:10,800
Did you pull off the old one broke
down. I left it man. That's for us.

1848
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:15,060
You know folks who like Christmas,
all of the Grinch over here. I know.

1849
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:17,780
But yeah, it's good. Youtube yet.

1850
01:56:17,790 --> 01:56:21,890
Subscribe to the Youtube and leave a
review on the, on the iTunes thing.

1851
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:24,910
If you're in the mood. That's
my opinion. There you go.

1852
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:30,600
Good way to support to also if you are
looking to improve and increase your

1853
01:56:32,221 --> 01:56:35,730
supply of fitness gear.
I just got a few things from my,

1854
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,670
my bicep brats.
You don't,

1855
01:56:38,671 --> 01:56:42,120
when you kinda choose to embark
on a different type of fitness,

1856
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:46,770
I dunno, you stick with the same thing. I
get it. No, but getting different things.

1857
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:49,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You get fired up. But
anyway, no, I don't want to go into that,

1858
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:53,760
but I got some new stuff anyway. Where
you get it is in my opinion, could on it.

1859
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:57,840
So on at Dotcom. Slash. Chocolate you can
get some good stuff on there including,

1860
01:56:57,841 --> 01:57:02,490
but not limited to kettlebells.
Maces and we get battle ropes.

1861
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:06,780
I just read some really good stuff
about battle ropes. I've done them,

1862
01:57:06,781 --> 01:57:09,940
but not with any kind of regularity.
Yeah, yeah. Like I want to,

1863
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:13,560
I want to do a battle rope
program. Hmm. Yeah, man.

1864
01:57:13,630 --> 01:57:18,420
I hope I don't go in too much, but it's
like, you know, like if you're trying,

1865
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:23,010
it's like for metcons and you can dump
your full body, boom, boom, boom. Yeah.

1866
01:57:23,011 --> 01:57:24,540
It's like it burns a lot of calories.

1867
01:57:24,541 --> 01:57:28,350
Get to in a muscular muscular conditioning
and stuff like that, but really good.

1868
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:29,810
I was like,
after you read it,

1869
01:57:29,811 --> 01:57:32,850
it's like you want to do battle
ropes from that one inquiry. Anyway,

1870
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:34,350
go ahead on it. Dotcom. Slash Jocko.

1871
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:39,650
I got the mace from
Jocko today as fired up.

1872
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:42,360
Heavier than your saw. Yeah. So and
I knew it was going to be happy.

1873
01:57:42,361 --> 01:57:46,620
That's the thing like I know because
that's only a 20 pounder and lucky if

1874
01:57:46,621 --> 01:57:48,210
you're one of those things.

1875
01:57:48,211 --> 01:57:52,050
I think you know when we talk about
kettlebells and people will say like what

1876
01:57:52,110 --> 01:57:53,880
size kettle bell do you start off with?

1877
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:58,680
It's hard to narrow that down.
That thing is heavy.

1878
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:01,620
There's not too many people that are
just getting all over that 20 pounds.

1879
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:06,330
This is like too heavy. I've never
done a workup before. By the way,

1880
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,580
this is too heavy for me to
do like a workout. I'm like,

1881
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,430
even even like it's so, it looks
like a big, what do you call it?

1882
01:58:13,470 --> 01:58:15,780
Not a bowling pin,
but you know the juggling pins,

1883
01:58:15,781 --> 01:58:17,730
you know like the people in the jail.
So it looks like that,

1884
01:58:17,731 --> 01:58:20,290
but it weighs 20 pounds.
It feels like it weighs like 50 pounds.

1885
01:58:20,650 --> 01:58:24,930
Literally feels like that because
it's all big anyway, but I'm going to,

1886
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:28,620
I'm going to work it in and I'm going
to report back and I feel that suit.

1887
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:32,220
I'm going to be a lot stronger
than you son like it. That's good.

1888
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:36,480
Speaking of that, if
maybe you're thinking, oh,

1889
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:38,100
instead of working out
I'm going to take a break.

1890
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:41,920
You can get the psychological
warfare album that has tracks,

1891
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:46,410
it's on iTunes, Google play
MP3. Whenever you get mp3s.

1892
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:52,350
Just a little bit of guidance on how to
overcome situations where maybe you're

1893
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:55,780
not going to get after it and you know
you should. Yeah. So there you go.

1894
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,820
Working on psychological
warfare two at this time,

1895
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:02,740
so that'll be coming in the future.

1896
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:05,410
All your excuses are lies
going to be the title,

1897
01:59:05,411 --> 01:59:08,560
psychological word for it to
all your excuses are lies. Yeah.

1898
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:12,580
See that kind of came well that's good.
I like how you do that.

1899
01:59:12,581 --> 01:59:17,230
I'd call it like a spot, like a spot. Like
if I'm going to go psychological spot.

1900
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:21,100
Yeah. That's what it is. Cause all of that
though because not everyone thinks of,

1901
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:25,630
when you say spot you're thinking of
1994 weight lifting bodybuilding. Sure.

1902
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:29,950
Oh No, power lifting. Yeah, I
guess you can't really spot on a,

1903
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,650
on a power clean like Olympic lifting.
Nonetheless,

1904
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:35,680
it is a spot nonetheless regards
to what an analogy you want to use.

1905
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,420
I think the band, the spot is the best
because you don't need a spot necessarily.

1906
01:59:40,990 --> 01:59:43,020
Most of them, you don't
need it most the time. Cool.

1907
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:46,360
But if you've got a spotter there
and you need the spot, boom,

1908
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:48,340
there it is and he's in a spot you
and he's going to bring you through.

1909
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:53,020
You're not going to let the barberry
you understand. Fair enough. Also,

1910
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:56,890
Jocko has some tea.
It's called Jocko white tea.

1911
01:59:57,610 --> 02:00:02,560
Interestingly enough, uh, dry tea,
which is tea bags and in it can,

1912
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:05,470
which I've been popping every day.
By the way,

1913
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:10,270
I'm not going to say it's an anti nausea
medication. I'm not going to say that.

1914
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:14,560
But as it turns out,
it's kind of an antinausea medication.

1915
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:17,680
Super refreshing because I can't,
by the way,

1916
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:21,310
it's also anti weakness because
once you drink Jocko white tea,

1917
02:00:21,311 --> 02:00:24,550
you can deadlift 8,000
pallets automatically. Hey,

1918
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:27,490
it's available in Canada too on
Amazon in Canada. That's new.

1919
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:32,590
So checkout Canadian folks up there,
hanging out with Jody Mitic somewhere.

1920
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:37,630
Sure.
Then you can get it there too.

1921
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:41,950
Also got some books where the
warrior kid and Mark's mission,

1922
02:00:42,970 --> 02:00:45,400
those are for children.

1923
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:50,200
But I think everyone that reads
him get something out of him.

1924
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:55,180
He's so check them out there. Might like
them. That video you did with Brian Rose,

1925
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:59,200
right? The lending area one. Um, some
of my brothers watching the video,

1926
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:04,840
I don't know why he's all like surprise,
like he's impressed. Okay, I get it.

1927
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:07,660
But like he's all surprised, impressed,
you know the difference. Right.

1928
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:09,910
So he's watching the video, the, you know,

1929
02:01:09,911 --> 02:01:13,120
how you basically the part where you
were explaining where the work here,

1930
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:16,300
part two marks mission, where are you
like okay, this psychological bully,

1931
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:19,320
you know, did this thing and no mark
wants to fight. I mean you can fight now,

1932
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:22,090
no Jujitsu. So he kind of wants to fight
him. So uncle Jake psych, you know,

1933
02:01:22,091 --> 02:01:26,830
comes in and he's all, hey
cool, you can fight them.

1934
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:30,910
So I was like, Oh Jake, you know, getting
nuts, whatever. Okay, you can find them.

1935
02:01:30,911 --> 02:01:34,750
But first you got to do recon or Intel
right until gathering or whatever,

1936
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:35,860
see what up.

1937
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:40,310
And so he does and he finds out all this
stuff you and through like finding the

1938
02:01:40,311 --> 02:01:40,911
stuff or whatever,

1939
02:01:40,911 --> 02:01:44,420
he gains like a little bit understanding
or whatever and so instead of fighting

1940
02:01:44,421 --> 02:01:46,940
them,
maybe you should help them kind of thing.

1941
02:01:46,941 --> 02:01:48,830
So it's like this little
curve ball. It's like, man,

1942
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:52,150
it's like kind of taking the high ground
when you don't expect you to just kind

1943
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:56,330
of liked that he liked down. He's all
impressed. Impressed with it. Not Bad on,

1944
02:01:56,331 --> 02:01:59,630
let them read that thing, still
reading it until my girl little girl.

1945
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:02,960
That's Jack's kind of the ethos, right?
The way that where he kid eat those,

1946
02:02:02,961 --> 02:02:05,090
you just read it. You just keep
reading when you're done reading it,

1947
02:02:05,091 --> 02:02:09,140
you read it again. Start all over. Yeah.
Yeah. She likes it. She liked the paper,

1948
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:12,350
Mashiach pumpkin situation.
She really liked.

1949
02:02:12,351 --> 02:02:14,210
That part was actually pretty fun.

1950
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:18,630
It was good and all are shining
through. Oh yeah. Big Tech.

1951
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:23,750
Also the field manual,
discipline equals freedom field manual.

1952
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:28,490
Best Book ever written. Best
Book. Physically look at
my opinion. Black on black.

1953
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:32,660
But do you think of that front cover
for a photograph? You like that? Yeah.

1954
02:02:32,661 --> 02:02:37,580
It's very iconic photograph.
Yeah, that's a good,

1955
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,421
that's a,

1956
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:43,421
it's like what do you call like a manual
for if you make it a manual for life in

1957
02:02:43,941 --> 02:02:46,190
general, I think you'd be on
the good path right there.

1958
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:48,250
I agree.
I agree.

1959
02:02:49,450 --> 02:02:54,070
If you need a manual for some leadership,
you got extreme ownership.

1960
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:59,260
That's the book that I wrote with my
brother Leif Babin and it's about combat

1961
02:02:59,261 --> 02:03:02,500
leadership and how you can apply the
lessons that we learned on the battlefield

1962
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:07,660
to everything you do in your business
and in your life and your relationships

1963
02:03:07,661 --> 02:03:12,661
with people and also coming pretty soon.

1964
02:03:13,021 --> 02:03:16,600
What actually is the follow on to that
book that are also wrote with leaf,

1965
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:20,650
the dichotomy of leadership.
It is, you know, you,

1966
02:03:20,651 --> 02:03:23,410
you've heard us talk about
dichotomy all the time.

1967
02:03:23,411 --> 02:03:27,460
It's actually the last chapter of extreme
ownership and this is the trickiest

1968
02:03:27,461 --> 02:03:31,060
thing about leadership is trying to
balance this dichotomy so we talk about it

1969
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:36,670
and do a deep dive and get granular
on how to balance that economy of

1970
02:03:36,671 --> 02:03:39,640
leadership.
In that book,

1971
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:43,360
which is titled The dichotomy of
Leadership. You can preorder it right now.

1972
02:03:43,390 --> 02:03:48,390
It comes out September 25th if you don't
want to get a copy when it comes out,

1973
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:54,160
then don't order it now and you won't
get one cause it's gonna sell out in.

1974
02:03:54,161 --> 02:03:57,250
The publishers are slacking as usual
and they'll be like, wait, wait, wait.

1975
02:03:57,260 --> 02:04:00,160
But there's probably a part of town,
a few of these because

1976
02:04:01,890 --> 02:04:05,950
they're projected numbers are off
always and you want to get the,

1977
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:09,070
you want to get the first edition.
That's my opinion,

1978

we do without you doing what you do.

2000
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:52,350
So thank you for protecting us and
taking care of us and also thanks to your

2001
02:05:52,351 --> 02:05:57,351
families who support you while you
support us and to everyone else.

2002
02:05:59,550 --> 02:06:00,383
Everyone else.

2003
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:05,640
Thanks for listening and
remember what the Getty is said

2004
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:12,650
that it isn't just sighs or numbers or
even courage itself that will ensure

2005
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:16,250
victory.
Instead,

2006
02:06:16,690 --> 02:06:21,060
it is exact observance of discipline.

2007
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:26,950
That is what it takes.
That is what you need.

2008
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:30,400
So go out there and get after it.

2009
02:06:31,690 --> 02:06:33,160
And until next time,

2010
02:06:33,730 --> 02:06:37,300
this is echo and Jocko out.
