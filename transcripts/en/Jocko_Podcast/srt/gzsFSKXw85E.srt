1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,480
How do you control rumors and
gossip within an organization?

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,130
That's pretty easy. You just, you
just talked about being, you know,

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:10,980
getting out there for the truth and your
propaganda arm to outside your company.

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:12,810
It's no different inside your company.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,140
You've got to make sure
that people [inaudible] I,

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,550
it's interesting that when you were,

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,110
we work with leaders sometimes you
see people that are like, well,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,230
I don't want to share those
with my people. You know,

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,800
cause I don't know what they might think.
Like they're,

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,730
they're thinking something that
may be totally not true. They're,

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,610
they're not just sitting
there not thinking anything
because you're not sharing

12
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:31,440
it with them. They're coming
up to their own conclusions,

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,070
which may be completely false or
opposite. But like we say in the, in the,

14
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,700
in the navy all the time,
you know, perception is
reality. That becomes reality.

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,840
So you've gotta,

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,700
you gotta you can defeat the gossip
and rumors by actually just sharing the

17
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,870
truth. Be Open with
people and uh, and, and,

18
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,370
and be in first out there with a
message so people get an understanding.

19
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:54,080
And even when horrible, bad things go
wrong, extreme ownership, right? If,

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,240
if you take ownership for that and
say, Hey, listen, this happened.

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,030
Here's what we're doing to fix it. Here's
what we're doing to turn things around.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,690
Um, it, it's kind of people,

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,420
people are not going to lose respect
for you and the organization.

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,400
They're actually going to gain
respect for you as a result.

25
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,990
Something we talk about all the time.
So don't be afraid to do that again,

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,070
just get the message out there and, and,
and be transparent and talk to folks.

27
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,140
If you don't tell people what's going on,

28
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:25,840
they're going to make up their
own ideas of what's going on.

29
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,450
And the thing that I have to,
I have to,

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,690
we have to, we have to take this
just a little bit further, right,

31
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,630
just a little bit further because
we talk about transparency, right?

32
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:42,000
And that word gets thrown
around all the time. And uh,

33
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,770
of the idea that you're just going to
you that the idea that you're just going

34
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:49,330
to tell everyone exactly what's going
on and that sounds great. And it's like,

35
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,670
Hey, I'm a fully transparent leader
and I'm gonna tell everyone's going on.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,700
But there's times where you
actually don't want to do that.

37
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,650
There's times where you have to maneuver
and you have to be tactful and some of

38
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:03,280
the things that you might tell someone
actually is not the right thing to do.

39
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,920
Now I'm, I'm, I, I'm
not saying we're, we're,

40
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:07,480
we're going to be
dishonest with our people.

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm not saying that and I'm saying
that transparency is a great thing,

42
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:15,280
but I mean, just on a personal
level, if laughs, laughs, uh,

43
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,260
working for me and he's not doing it,

44
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:23,140
he's doing something horrible is the
best way to go about that to fully true.

45
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,840
Full transparency is [inaudible]
you're doing horrible at this.

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,350
Is that the best way to do it in front
of the entire team in front of the right

47
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:32,560
is that, is that it's full transparency,
right? Hey, I'm fully transparent. Okay,

48
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,120
everyone welcome to the
meeting today by the way.

49
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:37,630
I just wanted to point out that life
mrs numbers again and he's a loser.

50
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,580
That might be what I'm thinking.
That's fully transparent. Hey guys,

51
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,370
I knew love lists too, right? Just being
transparent. Laughs and laughs a loser.

52
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,900
He missed his numbers again.

53
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,050
And you know what I'm actually thinking
about firing him just in case anyone was

54
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:53,860
wondering. So that's not going to
wait to close the business Friday.

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,420
Did I do a good job? Right? So, so
let's not get carried away, right?

56
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,080
You know, is the smart way. This smart
ways to maneuver the smart way is to say,

57
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,680
okay, lace not doing what he, what
he wants to, what he should be doing.

58
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,480
If I go and accuse him of failing, what's
his reaction going to be? How's it?

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,670
So what I do instead, instead I
go, I want to take ownership of it.

60
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:18,560
And so instead I say,
hey leaf, you know, hey,

61
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,910
come to conquer my office. I want to
talk to you about a couple things.

62
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:26,260
So he comes to my office or
not in a public place and
now it's, hey leaf. Hey Man,

63
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,910
I noticed that you, you know, you, you,

64
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,970
you missed your numbers and I'm thinking
that maybe I'm not giving you the kind

65
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,640
of support that you need to,
to get where you need to be.

66
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,140
Is there anything that else that you
need from me so that you can win again

67
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,260
inside? Sure. I'm thinking Lafe you
pathetic loser. You missed your name.
