1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,630
This is Jocko podcast number
44 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,620
Jocko Willink.
Good evening echo did he mean,

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,050
and the last podcast number
43 when a little bit long.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,150
Sure.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,560
We did not get to the Q and a and that's
one of the nice things about having a

6
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,191
podcast,

7
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:31,191
having a form that we actually own
and can do whatever we want with.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,010
If it goes long, that's cool.
What does it let it go along?

9
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:38,430
We can go down that road
now.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,040
Some people might say, oh, you went too
far down that road. Okay, that's fine.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,020
Press stop. You can go proceed
somewhere else. Some people say,

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,110
I wish you would have gone
further down that road.

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,830
So we're just kind of
going off of instinct here.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,340
What to me like,
okay,

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,370
we think we think we went far enough
down that road. We're good there,

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,930
but we did not get to Q and a.
And so

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,110
that's where we're going to do today.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Do some Q and a questions
from the interwebs.

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,140
Does always good. A lot of
people, tons of questions,

20
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,250
definitely appreciate all the questions
that are coming through. And I'm,

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,970
I apologize, I can't get to
all of them. I will say this,

22
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,870
I've talked to some, some troopers
out in the field and they're, they're,

23
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,410
they're like it. We know what you're
going to say. Like when a question comes,

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,740
which is awesome, that means
I'm working myself out of a job.

25
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,350
If you're out there and you already
know what the answer to the question is,

26
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,840
that's awesome. That means
cool. You figured out,

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,570
you know what you need to go educate
someone else, go help someone else go.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,100
So it's cool that people are
starting to understand, I think the,

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,090
the holistic mindset that's going on here,

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,320
and that's very positive to me.
Now that being said,

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,190
there's always questions that come
through. Sometimes even I'm go, okay,

32
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:06,960
well let me think about that one. And
some of them are really obvious. I got on,

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,820
you know, I got on a, on Twitter
the other day. Somebody asked me,

34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,021
somebody said,
hey,

35
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:17,970
what have you learned about
people or about humans since you,

36
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,800
you know, kind of entered the world of
social media on a, on a large scale.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,640
And I wrote back that I've figured out
that humans don't Google things before

38
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,600
they ask you the question on Twitter

39
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,340
because sometimes people just ask me,
you know,

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,810
the dis a question that you could
Google faster. The asked me about, uh,

41
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,770
you know,
just some quote the non one of my quotes,

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,630
but a Shakespeare quote or a book
or a military unit, you know,

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
man man,
Google that.

44
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,990
Don't ask me if you want to
ask me a specific question
that I might know some of.

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,390
That's cool. That's awesome.
I'm more than happy to answer.

46
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,400
Also I get asked 12 times a day,

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,800
what time do you go to sleep at night?

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,730
So I just read 11 and people
aren't laughing about that anyways,

49
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,650
but we do get some awesome questions
from the interwebs as well.

50
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,220
And the other thing that's cool about
answering questions from the interwebs is

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,250
it does make me think about that specific
situation that someone's in and a,

52
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,350
have I experienced it before, which
maybe I have, maybe I haven't,

53
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,730
I've at least probably seen it
before or some version of it.

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,310
But then once you answer
a question about it,

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,430
it quantifies and you bring it
solidifies it in your brain.

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,980
And now when I get asked that
question again and I'm like, boom,

57
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,960
I can answer it more,

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,170
I can answer with a little more authority
because I've seen it before that makes

59
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,220
it better.

60
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,870
So basically what I'm saying is when
I get forced to answer questions,

61
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,540
I am learning. Just like when
I'm reading a book I'm learning,

62
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,200
why don't we ask her a
question of learning? It's like
when you teach it, move a,

63
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,330
when you teach a move into Jitsu,
you get better at that move,

64
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,350
no doubt about it and that that's
why it is beneficial for me.

65
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:08,950
And I appreciate all these questions that
everybody asks me because they make me

66
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:12,130
smarter. Yeah, so all
right, rock and roll.

67
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,170
All question number one,
this one from those free,

68
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:20,050
you and Sam Harris. Sam
Harris. That's right.

69
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,630
Sam is sitting here by the way,

70
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:27,631
but the question is I would
like to start BJJ training,

71
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,280
but worry about injury. What are
your thoughts now? I actually,

72
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,060
we had these questions prepared for to
answer on the tail end of 43 and I will

73
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:42,460
say this, people want to know what's
in my mindset about things. You know,

74
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:45,940
what am I thinking? Here's one thing, and
you might notice this pattern. If you,

75
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:47,980
if you pay attention, close
attention, the podcast,

76
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,320
you might notice there's a pattern that
usually after these crazy dark books,

77
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,520
right?

78
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,580
I usually roll that first question in
the question and answer period is about

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,410
Jujitsu leg. Let's just,
let's just relax a little bit.

80
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,310
Somebody posted us, somebody k Bjj
cave man came and rolled with me. Yeah.

81
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,490
And someone was telling me, someone
that I know was telling me like, yeah,

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,930
my friend saw the picture, the video
of you rolling and they would like,

83
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,590
he looks like the happiest I've ever
seen him. And I was like, well yeah,

84
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,424
I was on the map.

85
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,090
So that's the general idea between let's
just go from the intensity generally of

86
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:33,610
a combat situation from a book into,
all right,

87
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,890
now we can take a wrap off and
we can talk about Jujitsu. Know.

88
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,910
I like that. Yeah, that makes sense.

89
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,040
So BJJ training and you're worried about
injuries. That makes sense. Actually.

90
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,170
I've got some,
I've got to ask this question a few times.

91
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,270
People that rely on their hands to
work, uh, one guy's professional,

92
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:55,780
actually two guys were professional
guitarists and they're sketched out about

93
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,450
doing Jujitsu.
Uh,

94
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,440
anybody that has a job that relies
on a lot of physicality, you,

95
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,860
you are at risk because you're, you
know, you're doing a sport. No injuries,

96
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,070
absolutely happened in Jujitsu.
It,

97
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,650
it is a contact sport and you can
get injured while you're doing it.

98
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,320
He can get injured in any sport
that you do. Any sports that you do.

99
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:21,830
The w the worst. My, I hurt my knee.

100
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,870
I had 80% tearing my MCL did it
surfing. Yeah. You know, Ben,

101
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,910
he'll hooked by dean lister of thousands,

102
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,150
but thousands and thousands of
times never had a knee injury.

103
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,740
I'm out surfing and hurt my knee
so you can get hurt doing anything.

104
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,543
But

105
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,940
so, so you have to be careful. Right?

106
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,170
And I think one of the best that one of
the most critical ways to be careful and

107
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:50,110
Jujitsu's by make sure that you're
picking the right training partners.

108
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,120
Cause there's some knucklehead training
partners at every gym and are there a

109
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:59,490
2022
year old male

110
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,200
who has a lot of testosterone
and has a very sensitive ego.

111
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,230
And so he's looking just
to crush everyone. So you
gotta Watch out for that guy.

112
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,430
And I had, actually, I shouldn't,

113
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,470
I shouldn't actually paint that so broad
brush because there's plenty of people

114
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:20,970
that are, that are older people with a big
ego and younger people. There's people,

115
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:23,430
there's this basically you've got to
watch out for these knuckleheads that are

116
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:27,780
going to go crazy. Some people don't
know better too, you know, they're just,

117
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,620
they just happen to be being in strong
and they're not really knuckles or if

118
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,900
they're just like, yeah,
they're getting it. You know,

119
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,150
they told me to grab the arm and pull.
I'm trying to pass that guard.

120
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:39,980
I don't know that much technique. I'm just
going to go hard. Yeah, no, you're right.

121
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,900
They're, they're, they're not
intentionally being aggressive.

122
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,990
But Jujitsu is an aggressive sport
and if you happen to be 260 pounds,

123
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,380
that can be problematic.
So you want to,

124
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,650
and I know it sounds
weird if it goes well,

125
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:55,240
how do we roll some purple belt that's
just going to run through me. No,

126
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,640
actually you do Google belt.

127
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,290
The chance of you getting hurt by a
purple belt are infinitely less than you

128
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,290
getting hurt by a white belt. Absolutely
true. And the higher you go up,

129
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,640
the more accurate that is.
Unless of course you're a,
you're a, you're a problem,

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,390
right?

131
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,190
Or you're a bully and there needs to
be a regulatory situation happening in

132
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:17,100
which case of black belt is
not going to, you know, he,

133
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,590
he won't into youth though.
That's the thing. It's like true.

134
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,190
I think when you enter fighting sports,

135
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,990
punishment isn't being beat up. You get
beat up. That's part of the game. True.

136
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,720
It's more, it's more of like
an embarrassment thing or like,

137
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,780
yeah, like they're going
to wear you out, you know,

138
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:39,650
or make you look like
you soccer. It's, it's,

139
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,100
it's more of like a lesson thing in
that way. Not like getting beat up.

140
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,080
I agree with you. Now another piece
of this and I, this is just a reality.

141
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,700
Okay.
Doing standup,

142
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,800
you have a higher chance of getting
hurt, like doing take downs, heartache.

143
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,910
Takedowns yeah. Either judo type style
takedowns or resting sal take downs.

144
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,920
You have a higher chance of getting
a knee injury or an ankle injury.

145
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,210
There's no doubt about it.
Yeah. So you be careful.

146
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,690
Just think about what you're doing there.
Um,

147
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,960
okay.

148
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,000
W with, with standups, do you know
if you're a person that's, you know,

149
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:18,280
do you got to get alerts of
basic takedowns? Absolutely.

150
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,510
But do you need to step in there
night after night and get your full on

151
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:27,310
wrestling practice together as if you're
a 43 year old person that, you know,

152
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,730
you're a 43 year old cop that's working
the beat. You, you know, you need to know,

153
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:33,390
take downs, don't get me wrong. You
need to train them. You need to study.

154
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,420
You need to make sure
you know how to do them.

155
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,280
Do you need to out wrestle somebody,
you know, in a wrestling situation?

156
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,160
Probably not. You know, you're,
you're not going to need you that.

157
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,910
So just use caution with takedowns.
Um,

158
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,400
make sure you know how to do them,

159
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,610
but as you get to where you want to
not get injured is your point of your

160
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,843
primary.

161
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,523
Okay.

162
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,540
Thoughts training. Then just
be careful to stand up. Um,

163
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,440
obviously do a good warm up and this
is something I'm just the worst. Uh,

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,833
okay.

165
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,780
Perpetrator of not warming up.
Well, I like to warm up by rolling.

166
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,360
So it actually,

167
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:17,570
now I do usually do one round where I'm
just kind of chilling and just kind of

168
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:21,620
rolling flow. But I used to not even do
that. He's just like clap hands and go.

169
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,530
So don't do that. Obviously.
Keep your ego in check.

170
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:25,231
And I'll tell you another thing,

171
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,990
and I was talking about this
with Greg train the other day,

172
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,600
cause Greg dream popped his ribs.
Yeah. And he was just saying to me,

173
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:37,100
he's ribs recovered now, but he was
saying to me, you know, he's like,

174
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,340
I think you don't get injured because
you work out all the time. And I'm like,

175
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,930
I agree with you 100%.
Yeah.

176
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,330
So I believe that you should
work out on a regular basis.

177
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:50,860
And somebody just asked me, do you
train and lift on the same days? I said,

178
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,910
yeah, absolutely. I trained and lift.
I train and left every day. Yeah.

179
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,050
So get your workout program going on.
You know, make sure you maintain that.

180
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:01,840
Some people when they
start doing Jujitsu there,

181
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,690
they're going so crazy that they use
all this muscle and so they go, I can't,

182
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,650
I'm not going to work out because I'm
just getting a workout. No wrong answer.

183
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,330
Keep working out. And matter of fact, you
should. And I was encouraged working out,

184
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:18,500
lifting, doing your Matt Kahn, doing
whatever before you do Jujitsu. Mm.

185
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,633
That's what I do.

186
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,120
I want to be tired when I show up to
g two and fight in a worst scenario,

187
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,010
you know,
make it harder for myself.

188
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,490
I don't want to show up and be all fresh
and like that's going to happen every

189
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:33,830
day. No, I like to be tired, worn out,

190
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,290
stressed system and then show up and
still get after it on the mats. Yeah.

191
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,890
That part's pretty advanced though to
do it like that. I got to say, I mean,

192
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,730
being new as the question, I've
done that the whole time. Yeah.

193
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,990
And I've done that too before
and good. Yeah. You Do,

194
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:55,530
you work out after you lift weights after
you train Jujitsu? I've done both. Okay.

195
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,530
What do you do normally?

196
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,820
I do one and like I don't
do two days normally. Oh,

197
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,100
see when you roll into the mat,

198
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,120
you're like all fresh in a matter of
speaking at fresher than I would be if I

199
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:09,850
did a workout before. Yes. Let's
put it that way. That's cool. No,

200
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,860
but as of right now, that
is how it is. Yes, for sure.

201
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,540
But before and even when I was training
for competition and stuff. Oh yeah.

202
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,670
And even, yeah, like maybe like two
years at three years ago maybe. Um, yeah,

203
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,504
I'd work out.

204
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,700
I do the workout first and then go roll
out like in the, I think that's the plan

205
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,400
as much as you can work on
your flexibility and this
is something that I, again,

206
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,480
this is a big fail area in my book.
I'm not flexible as I should be.

207
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,740
And you, if you are more flexible with
your injury levels are going to go down.

208
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,960
Yeah. So, you know, stretch and it's
really easy stuff that, you know,

209
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:50,140
everyone says to do. You know, when
you're sitting there on the mat,

210
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:52,270
even when you're sitting in the mat
and the teacher's teaching Chino,

211
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,330
try and go to Lotus position. Try and
you'll just do stretches where doing that,

212
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,620
if you're sitting around,

213
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,260
just stretch while you're sitting around
while you're working on your computer,

214
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,290
sit in a way that you're getting
some kind of stretch. So,

215
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,150
so stretch and be flexible as much
as you can. Now another thing,

216
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,020
I kind of talked about
guitarists and anybody, you know,

217
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,990
a surge in anybody that's working with
their hands and wants to protect her

218
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:11,824
fingers,

219
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,980
I would recommend maybe emphasizing more
Nogi where you're not grabbing onto an

220
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,800
Aggie all the time. Yeah. Yeah.

221
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,910
And it gave me fingers get caught up in
there and need twists or something to if

222
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,750
in Yanco silk. Yeah. Every time.
Pretty much. It's fairly common.

223
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,310
Um, I actually, my worst finger injury
was actually Nogi. So that's an,

224
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,580
I only did it a couple months ago, which
is just, and it was just a bizarre,

225
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,220
you know, it's a bizarre incident.
He was one of those things.

226
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:44,221
So that's why it's really hard for me
just to straight up encourage somebody

227
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:50,770
that needs their fingers. Like,
no, no, don't worry. You're
not gonna get no, no, no,

228
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:54,700
you can't get her. Now I've had
one finger injury, you know,

229
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:59,701
significant finger injury in 20 plus
years so you can get a finger injury.

230
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,630
Cutting the carrots on the, you
know, in the kitchen is, so,

231
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,450
you know,
you gotta be careful,

232
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,350
but there's no guarantee that you're
not going to hurt. And I'll say it.

233
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:15,070
And the other thing is, I will say this,
you got some chance of getting injured,

234
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,790
right?

235
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,790
But there's also some massive physical
and mental benefits that we'll likely

236
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,220
outweigh the injuries.

237
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:26,620
The perceived injuries are the
possible injuries that you might get.

238
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,100
So you're just be healthier.
You're, you're, your fingers
are going to be stronger.

239
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,280
I mean, yeah, you might get
some injured fingers. Uh,

240
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,010
but you are also going to have
fingers that are stronger.

241
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:39,280
Your grip is going to be stronger.
So that's beneficial.

242
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,040
Your mind has to be stronger, your
cardiovascular systems can be stronger.

243
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:47,041
So there's a lot of benefits to
Jujitsu that outweigh in my mind,

244
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,190
the possibility of having an injury.
Yeah.

245
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,490
I mean a of having a catastrophic
injury is pretty small,

246
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:59,030
especially if you train smart.
Really is agree. Absolutely agree.

247
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,450
Yes. And when you think about it,
even of the people that you know,

248
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,880
over 20 years, that's a lot
of people that, you know,

249
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,070
oof had any kind of major injury.

250
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,330
If you count, it tends to do count
as a major injury. But you know,

251
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:15,670
if you blow out your knee,
that means you're gonna be down,

252
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:18,520
you're going to be six months of surgery
or whatever surgery and six months of

253
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:21,250
Rehab and then another three months
before you can try it. That's, you know,

254
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,170
that's a year. And that could be, some
people consider that catastrophic injury.

255
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,650
I know I would be devastated,
but at the same time, you know,

256
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:31,960
I or I got neck surgery,
I was out for a bit.

257
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,770
Don't even remember it now flashing the
Pan, who cares, whatever deal with it.

258
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,650
I played more guitar during that
time. You know what I mean? Good Times

259
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,400
in uh,
in reference to this question,

260
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,720
and this is anything you do guys on
the basketball court all the time. Oh,

261
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:50,050
I'll go up for just recreational
basketball pickup game weekend, whatever.

262
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:53,980
Blow their knee, ankle, whatever. You know
I had, I mean I've been in the game what,

263
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:57,730
12 years? I had one cause I was
getting nuts in a tournament.

264
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,170
Bicep tear, major injury, you know,
out for, you know, a year or whatever.

265
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,390
But other than that,

266
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,010
never been injured because of a
submission out of training too. Yeah.

267
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,530
In full speed training competence,

268
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,020
like everything in its
first submission holds go,

269
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,120
never been injured in a submission.
You know how like,

270
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,850
yeah, passionate time or
should, we should definitely,

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,910
if you're a smart judges declare you'll
never get injured from somebody trying

272
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:23,410
to submission.
Right.

273
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,160
Cause you tap, you tap in. Look,
it's not going to not hurt. You know,

274
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,650
if you tap too late,
usually it's just you get hurt.

275
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,300
Maybe your shoulders kind of whatever
for a week or we can still train.

276
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,210
It's not an injury. Put it that
way. You know? And even if, yeah,

277
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,020
even if you're your big smile,
I think that's pretty common.

278
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,660
It's really rare that I see,
oh I'm,

279
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:46,930
my ACL is out because of a heel hook
maybe in competition because you're trying

280
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:51,700
to, when you weren't trying to tap those
few. Okay. But yeah, generally speaking,

281
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,910
it's surprising almost
that it's that safe is,

282
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,790
well you can see that when you consider
what the objective of the sport is to

283
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:04,600
break and destroy people's limbs in the
fact that it rarely happens, you know,

284
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,500
it just really happens. So yes,
be careful. There's no guarantees.

285
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,513
But Trey,

286
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,130
back to the training partners
part, you know, when you,

287
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,250
the first one where you were saying,

288
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,450
be careful who you trained with
and stuff like that. So sometimes,

289
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:24,030
especially like, let's say
if you're older or, um,

290
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,090
even if you're a girl and
you go in and you know,

291
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,430
you're the only girl and you
know, some people will, they like,

292
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,480
let's say the guy doesn't know
any better and he's going hard.

293
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,830
You can tell when he starts to go hard,

294
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,450
sometimes it can be awkward to kind of
say, hey, you know, like respectfully,

295
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm not going to roll with you.
And because of, you know, it's,

296
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:44,800
it's kind of like asking someone to dance
in them saying no, you know, like, oh,

297
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,350
it's like rejection.
So it's awkward.

298
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,950
So sometimes people will just tough it
out and be like, just try to endure.

299
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,410
I think if you can find,
you know,

300
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,450
if you can go through that and really
look out for yourself where, you know,

301
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,430
the guy's going nuts,
it's obviously,

302
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:02,910
usually he's not trying to go nuts
and hurt him. That's pretty rare.

303
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,870
But they don't know any better. They
were white belt or you know, whatever.

304
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,820
And they're just bigger
and stronger, whatever, and
they're going nuts. You got us.

305
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,180
You got to find the good, tactful
way to be like, Hey, I respect you,

306
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,340
but I'm concerned about like just my
injuries or whatever. You know what?

307
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,540
Hey, sorry. I only role with
people under one 30, cause I
have a, you know, uh, yeah,

308
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,310
injured, ribbed, Yay. And there you
go. Just just, is that a white lie?

309
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,210
Maybe it is,

310
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,800
but I don't think it's a malicious white
lies are fine when you're bring Sam

311
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,190
Harris. I apologize for telling people
that you tell a little white lie to save

312
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:42,630
themselves massive injuries,
catastrophic injuries. But again,

313
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:45,730
it's like telling someone no one,
they asked you to death.

314
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:49,920
So you can tell white lies.
The fact is meant for my own reasons.

315
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:54,840
I don't want to dance, you know? Yeah.
But it might be okay to say, oh, sorry.

316
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,680
Um, I'm here with Billy over there
and so I can't dance with you.

317
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,230
And that's actually gonna make you feel
better than just, hey, you know what?

318
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:04,740
Actually I don't like you.
Yeah, you kind of disgust me.

319
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,480
So I'm not dancing with you.
Walk away isn't necessarily
to do that. Probably not.

320
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,170
Maybe the little white lies. Okay.
Helps you again, Sam Harris, apologize.

321
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,890
We're encouraging line.
It's like things like,

322
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm not going to say you're a Spazz,
you're a liability.

323
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,930
You might hurt me because of
what you don't know how to do.

324
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,790
I'm not going to roll with you.
That's different.

325
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,680
You know you mean you offended the guy?

326
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,550
Most likely so actually we were actually
talking about that while you are on the

327
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:37,920
Jujitsu.
Matt's doing physical Jujitsu.

328
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:41,790
Sometimes you got to throw in a little
mental Jujitsu in the situation and just

329
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,020
manipulate a little bit the mentality
of your training partners and that is in

330
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:51,021
the spirit of safety indeed because I
don't think chocolate would ever say that

331
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,560
to anybody. You'd be like, Oh, you're a
spazz. Bring it on if I'm not mistake,

332
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,910
you've got to deal with them people.
Next question.

333
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,400
When dealing with new groups of folks
before you go there, by the way,

334
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,510
sometimes you should train with someone
that's really a spazz and harder and

335
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:11,580
bigger than you.
You should do that sometimes.

336
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,390
Now you should use caution when you do it.
Maybe you can get that.

337
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:18,180
I would rather if my,
like my son,

338
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,880
if I'm going to have him train
with someone that's big and strong.

339
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,641
I'm sharing with you,

340
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:24,450
I'm having trained with Dean because I
know that you guys won't give him enough

341
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:25,940
strength to,
you know,

342
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,810
but you're not going to hurt him
because he's only 140 pounds. Yes,

343
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,680
but I don't want to give
the impression here,

344
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:32,970
like sometimes you got to roll with that.

345
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,100
Sometimes you got to roll with
somebody that's big, strong,

346
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,950
and doesn't know what they're doing just
so you're now you and I know what to do

347
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:42,330
there, but if you're a a
blue belt or a or a, yeah,

348
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,760
if you're a blue belt
and a big wrestler show,

349
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:49,761
then you weigh 165 pounds and a wrestler
shows up that weighs two 40 and it's

350
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:55,390
his third day and you're a
young guy. You know, it's,

351
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,420
it's a good idea to roll with that person
because they're going to do things you

352
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:00,130
weren't expecting.
They're really strong,

353
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:03,730
going to be trying really hard and
you want to be, you want to be,

354
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:08,470
you want to train for yourself for the
unexpected. So basically don't just weed,

355
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,890
I'm not saying we, and when I say, you
know, watch your training partners,

356
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,630
I'm not saying for a normal person that's
training crawl into a a safety bubble

357
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,530
while you're on the mats. Know especially
people that are, you know, young and fit.

358
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,250
You should be training with every person.
You can't every different body style.

359
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,380
Try Him out.
Big wrestles small people,

360
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:29,350
lanky people turn with them all
because that gets you used to all those

361
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:31,540
different buys also improves your game.
Yeah.

362
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,560
I'm saying if you are very concerned
about injuries because you have a job that

363
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:40,540
requires you to, you know, use your hands
or walk or whatever, then you go, okay,

364
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:44,030
you know what? I need to take the
long, the long vision here, the law,

365
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,080
fight the long war and really be
selective on my training partners.

366
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,910
Absolutely correct. Yes. Just like, whoa.
I mean just like other question is I'm,

367
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,830
I want to start Jujitsu
and I'm worried about him.

368
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,340
Exactly that guy. Use Your,
use your brain. Exactly.
But just like how you said,

369
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:01,480
when you get to about blue belt,

370
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:05,410
you got to start introducing
more challenges in different
ways and absolutely

371
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:09,460
correct men. Because if, if you
don't, you don't, and you can,

372
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,810
let's say you're not used to,

373
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,800
let's say you use the same trading
partners and you trained with, you know,

374
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,960
blue belts for a belt.

375
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,100
There is specific and very effective
Jujitsu moves for other Jujitsu moves,

376
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,750
right?
So it's like don't turn your back.

377
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:27,370
All these rules that are pretty
fundamental, that rarely should be broken,

378
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,090
and we all know him. So you roll
with a guy who's hits third days,

379
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,610
the athletic wrestler, he doesn't
know those rules, but now,

380
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:36,290
so he puts you outside of the
whole formatted you did to do.

381
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,590
And if you don't know it, it's
like Dang. It's almost like,

382
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,830
did you just not really working that
good? You know, if you're not used to it,

383
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:43,810
but if you are, you still
at, you'd be like, okay.

384
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,930
And that was such a good technique
to use with people, right?

385
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,200
When you're dealing with people,
people like people's personalities.

386
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,470
People have a personality that they,

387
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,680
that's how they deal with
things and they get people,

388
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:58,180
they funnel people into their world.
So if you have to break that,

389
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,660
just step outside their world, like don't
get drawn into people's worlds, right?

390
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:03,970
Don't get drawn into people's strengths.
I mean, we talked about it all the time,

391
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:05,320
but don't get drawn into their strength.

392
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:09,070
Don't get drawn into their way
of fighting because it's not,

393
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,230
you're not going to be able to win that
battle because you do it all day long.

394
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,140
Right? So just come at them
from a different angle,

395
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,170
usually disarmed or some cow instead
of being confrontational. We,

396
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,220
and this is just normal stuff,

397
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:21,340
but instead of being confrontational or
somebody take a little flank and maybe,

398
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,530
you know, massage their ego a little bit,
but that's it. It's exact same thing. If,

399
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,640
if people have a way of doing things
and you can get outside their pattern,

400
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,180
you have a better chance
of getting a victory. Yeah.
Yeah. That's crazy. How that,

401
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,590
all right.
When dealing with new groups of folks,

402
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:44,010
when do you do decentralized command
right away or gradually as in slowly give

403
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,340
them trust or slowly
take it away as needed?

404
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,640
Again,
this is a good solid question.

405
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:56,300
This is something that people ask on a
fairly regular basis and it's a pretty

406
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,430
straightforward answer. Um, okay.

407
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:03,431
You can't obviously just right away just
just give people full autonomy because

408
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:08,870
you have to build it up
somewhat incrementally.

409
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,940
Give them the opportunity to be on their
own now and what what you're really

410
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:14,630
building,

411
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,590
what you're really building
with decentralized command
is you're building trust

412
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,150
and and that that's what you're
trying to do. And as I've said before,

413
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:26,750
the best way to build
trust is to give trust.

414
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,220
But before you give trust,
you've got to set expectations.

415
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,031
You've got to set standards.

416
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,810
You have set guidelines because this
person that you're just a minute,

417
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,360
a new person, they might be, they might
be a crazy, they might be incompetent,

418
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:41,690
they might have a totally different
vision of what's okay then you might,

419
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,620
they might be unethical.

420
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:46,970
There's all kinds of things that they
might be that you cannot allow for,

421
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,560
so what you have to do
is set those standards,

422
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:53,390
set those guidelines and put those,

423
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,990
put those guardrails in place so that you
make sure that this person is ethical.

424
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,580
Make sure that they do our professional,

425
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,340
make sure that they do
have the same standards.

426
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:07,610
Make sure that they understand the
expectations. You set farm and that's,

427
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,330
that's when you can start to handout
more slack and more ownership because we

428
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:17,150
don't wanna micromanage.
When I was talking about parameters,

429
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:19,370
I'm not talking about telling people
exactly how to do it, but let,

430
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,030
let's say you and I started working
together and you are my subordinate.

431
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,650
If we fast forward two years
from now, I'd be like, Hey, echo,

432
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,360
this is what we're trying to get done.
Make it happen.

433
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,410
I'll check back with me
when it's done right.

434
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:35,270
That's how much leeway I'm giving you.
I don't even care,

435
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,240
but when we first started working
together, I'm like, Hey, echo,

436
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:39,200
here's what we want to get done.

437
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,900
Can you come up with a plan
and then and then let me know.

438
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,790
Let me take a look at what
you're going to do. Boom.

439
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,690
Now I'm still letting you fully own the
plan, but I'm going to do a little check.

440
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:49,820
I'm going to make sure that it's the right
gym and make sure it's a good plan to

441
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,620
make sure it's a smart plan.
I'm gonna make sure it handles,

442
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:54,770
are our resources correctly.
So all those things I'm just going to,

443
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:57,440
and then the more we work together,
the more we build the trust.

444
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:59,000
The more you understand the expectations,

445
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,670
the less guidance I'm going to give you,

446
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,860
the less oversight I'm going to give you,

447
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,940
cause I'm getting built up because you've
built up trust with me and I've built

448
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,660
up trust with you.
So that's important.

449
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,900
I also want you to be able
to make your own decisions

450
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,860
because I don't want to be making
decisions all the time, you know?

451
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,270
So even when you,

452
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:23,450
even in the first scenario when I've
been working with you for a long time,

453
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,780
you know, I say, Hey, echo goofy this out
you go, you go handle it, you get it done.

454
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,270
When we first started working together,
you might come to me and say, Hey Jocko,

455
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,820
I hit this wall.
What do you want me to do here?

456
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,560
What do you think I'm going to say? Figure
it out. I'm going to say, figure it out.

457
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,980
I'm going to say, hey man, I, I don't
know. What's your, what's your best guess?

458
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,160
Or how would you do it? Or, you know,
we knew each other a little bit better.

459
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:46,560
I'd say, hey man, don't come asking me
those questions. Go figure that out.

460
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:50,850
I don't care how you do it.
Just get around that wall.
Boom, and we're done. And

461
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,710
now the other one other key part of this
is oftentimes if you take over a new

462
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:00,570
team,
you may want to,

463
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,320
you may want to start off by setting
the example by running the perfect

464
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:07,911
operation,

465
00:27:07,911 --> 00:27:12,911
by going from end to end with some project
that you set this standard on how you

466
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:16,760
want things to be. So every looks,
and he goes, okay, that's how, okay,

467
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:21,380
I see how he did that. Whoa,
he wants that done. He, oh,
he holds the line on that. So

468
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:27,080
that way everybody knows what the standard
is. So there's in, and I would always,

469
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:30,830
you know, I mean I would always, when I
start off, when I took over a platoon,

470
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,950
take over a squad like, okay,
we're doing this operation. Cool.

471
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:37,910
Here's how I would run it very distinctly,
very clearly be the guy.

472
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,900
And then as time goes
on and trust develops,

473
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:45,620
I'm going to become less and less
the guy and more and more the

474
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,240
the decentralized leader that's stepping
back and letting the frontline troopers

475
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:53,910
lead. That's what I'm going
to try and make happen. Um,

476
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,510
as always, when you do start with a
new group, it's real easy. Be Humble.

477
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,520
Listen, take advice, ask,
ask questions, ask questions,

478
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,120
ask good questions about things that you,

479
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,270
if there's something you don't
understand, ask the question. No big deal.

480
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,560
Make the slow incremental changes
like Hackworth talks about in steal my

481
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:16,080
soldiers started. He just gets
good and change two things a day,

482
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,390
not going to change the whole
world over night, can't do it.

483
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,320
So he's going to change two things a day.
That being said,

484
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:25,680
he also did some major to remember
if you remember this Hackworth,

485
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:28,530
he gets in there and the guys have radios
and they got guitars and they got all

486
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:31,020
this stuff and he goes, yeah, put a lot
of stuff in the middle of the compound.

487
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,170
It's Outta here tomorrow.
Right. That was a major change.

488
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,920
So he went and kind of shook them up
a little bit, but then he goes, okay,

489
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,300
now I've got to go the long war.

490
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,610
I'm to change to little things
a day and that's what he did.

491
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,980
So sometimes it's a combination of those
two. Sometimes you got to have to give,

492
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,870
send a little shock value
like, Hey, new sheriff in town.

493
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,350
That's what they used to
say in the seal teams.

494
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:52,920
So he's commanding officer
would come over if he would do,

495
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,990
a lot of times they do something to

496
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,510
assert their presence
like, Hey, I'm here now.

497
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,560
No more parking in the back
lot and you know what I mean?

498
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,680
Or Hey News,
new seal.

499
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:11,681
I just took over no more wearing
this uniform to this place.

500
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,360
Okay, so everyone go, okay,
new sheriff in town. Let,

501
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,180
let's let him get this out of his system.
Do they,

502
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,190
do they typically react in that
way where they're like, look,

503
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,160
I see what you're doing there.
Cool.

504
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,530
Pretty much in the seal teams it would
be like, oh, okay. Yeah. And Hey,

505
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:31,320
new sheriff in town. He just came
up with a new rule for us to fall,

506
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,860
so we know he's here. Cool. Right.

507
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,660
It's not like some resentment.

508
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,320
Maybe the guys that are less mature,
I use word,

509
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,930
but maybe guys that weren't quite
as in the game would be like,

510
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,830
what do you do when this poor be
a hey bro, don't worry about it.

511
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,810
It's a new sheriff in town. He's, he's got
it. He's let us know where he, he's here.

512
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,270
Yeah, he's got it. We got it. So
we're all good. Yeah. That's cool.

513
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,380
Uh, but occasionally see occasionally
you get somebody that comes in,

514
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,860
you notice the things that I just
said, we're, we're fairly irrelevant.

515
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,340
Like he don't wear this uniform there or
hey, don't park in this part, whatever.

516
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,750
Those are fairly inconsequential
things and those things are, are okay.

517
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,280
Actually occasionally you'd see somebody
come in and try and do it, you know,

518
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:19,600
execute some kind of a, a fundamental
change and that's where you go,

519
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:20,434
wait a second man,

520
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,950
you've been here for a day and a half
and you want to execute a fundamental

521
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:26,440
change in what we're doing here.
There's a, we have a problem with that.

522
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:29,350
We as we as the troops have a problem
with that because you don't know,

523
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:31,330
how do you know? Yeah, I knew
I've been doing this for,

524
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,870
I was at seal team one for eight years.
You know, you're going to show up.

525
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:36,040
I've been here for five years.

526
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,740
You're going to tell me how
it's better to do this and I,

527
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:42,100
that might not be the right attitude
for a young guy like myself to have,

528
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:44,770
but that's the attitude that you're going
to generate if you come in and try and

529
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:47,290
make fundamental changes
without assessing.

530
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,600
So show some tactical patients
when you come in and say,

531
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,980
okay, let me check this out. And
again, just to refer back to the hack,

532
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,863
the Hackworth story,

533
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,870
Hackworth was going to take over a
battalion that was all jacked up.

534
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,020
They were called the hopeless.
Right.

535
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:04,320
And he wanted a tournament
into the hardcore. So he,

536
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,680
his shocking thing that he did was
meant to shock and it was also meant to

537
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,510
square them away and was
also the right thing to do.

538
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,800
And they also had a bad reputation.

539
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,620
If he went in and took
over really good battalion,

540
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,100
he wouldn't go in there with the same
shock and awe type treatment cause they

541
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:21,040
don't need it.
So you got to,

542
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,970
you got to think about what you're doing.
But I mean most cases,

543
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:28,260
unless you're taking over some
kind of a problem situation very,

544
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,430
you might have to use
a little shock and awe.

545
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,930
If you're taking over normal shit
situation, all the boss got promoted,

546
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,900
you're going to go into, go into his
parole. Hey no problem. Come in there,

547
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:39,300
be humble. Listen. Then as you see fit,
make some small incremental changes. Yeah,

548
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,550
like the shotgun off thing. We'll probably
work against you in a, in a, you know,

549
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:46,540
a normal situation. Oh yeah.
It'll definitely work against you.

550
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,310
It'll definitely work against you now.
You now,

551
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,340
cause now you're thinking about it, now
you're imposing a plan on people. Yeah.

552
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,840
People don't like to have plans
imposed upon them. They don't like it.

553
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,650
They don't like it.
Even the,

554
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:03,130
even the big controlled military where
everyone's in our chain of command. No,

555
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,160
no one in the military likes to have
big new ideas imposed upon them without

556
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:14,530
fault and without assessment and without
explanation and without telling people

557
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:19,180
why. No, you don't do that
and that what you want.

558
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:23,860
And what you want to do is by doing all
those things, by building that trust,

559
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,930
by setting the standards,
by setting the guidelines,

560
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:29,170
by putting the guard rails in
place, by listening, by respecting,

561
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,180
by being humble.

562
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:36,100
What you will do is you will
lead people to lead themselves.

563
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,490
And that's what you want.
Yeah.

564
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,230
Explaining why I feel like that's
maybe an underappreciated thing.

565
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,390
I'll tell you what, it's not under
appreciated my book. That's the absolute,

566
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,950
that is the current, that's
a critical piece. Yeah, even,
I mean, people watch it,

567
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,290
they'll want to know. You could go in
and let me really, when you think about,

568
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,360
you could go in and change
some fundamental thing.

569
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,170
If you explain why and then everyone's
like, oh yeah, that makes sense,

570
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,810
but just like, are you saying if
you, if you roll in and you're just,

571
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:08,570
you make a fundamental
change, everyone's like, Bro,

572
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:12,620
we were doing it that way for a
reason and you just came in changed.

573
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,670
But he explained why and I
understand it makes more sane.

574
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,240
You get feedback because maybe what
you said is the wrong decision.

575
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,940
You might be saying something
that's like, right, you know what?

576
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:22,380
You didn't think that through
really all that well. Yeah.

577
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,960
And you need to discuss this with the,

578
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:28,010
with the troops and figuring
out what their assessment
of, of your callers. Yeah.

579
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,060
Yeah. It's again, one of those
things where when we talk
about it like this, like,

580
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:35,180
yeah, Yep. That makes perfect
sense. But it's, I dunno,

581
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,740
it seems it was funny is on the podcast,
just as an example,

582
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:45,440
we talked fairly shortly about going
to the podcast once every two weeks.

583
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,303
Right?

584
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,690
I didn't really give a good explanation
of why and you know what feedback I got.

585
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,560
It was a, you gotta be kidding
me. Well No, when this thing
comes out on Wednesday,

586
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,210
Jocko, I don't know what your problem
is. The podcast comes out on Wednesday.

587
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,600
And I had, and I got that
feedback from numerous people,

588
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:10,870
not only on social media but
also in a face to face. You know,

589
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,630
people that texted me and called me and
said, Bro, you can't go to once a week.

590
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,350
And there was people that I would say,
first of all, if you're going to do that,

591
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,360
you need to set some kind of warning.

592
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:24,140
You need to let people know we need some
time. And so it was, it was, it was funny,

593
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,110
but the, the essential thing that
I did not do is say, hey guys,

594
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:27,950
here's what's going on.

595
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,450
Here's a why I would want to
do this in a different way.

596
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,970
And I didn't really explain that.
You know,

597
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:37,580
we just kinda cause it wasn't an
actual decision that was getting made.

598
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:38,630
It was a consideration.

599
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,710
The consideration has been revoked
by the way we're holding the line,

600
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,280
we're holding the line and
when we do have to do that,

601
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:47,450
which may or may not happen,

602
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:51,800
but I will explain why in great detail
so everyone understands where I'm coming

603
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:56,210
from because I don't want
to leave anybody hanging up.

604
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,050
I don't think it'll be like,
Hey Jocko,

605
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,220
I feel like you don't really
understand what's going on here.

606
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,490
You know on the front lines, the front
lines, we wait for that podcast as long.

607
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,630
Awesome.
Next question.

608
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,870
Jukka what are some workouts to progress
in becoming more relaxed in the water?

609
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,660
I need to lower my heart
rate. Okay. Again, this is a

610
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,430
a good question. That's actually a
little bit of a universal question.

611
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:26,121
That's why again,

612
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:29,120
I like to take questions at apply
universally to multiple things.

613
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,240
Becoming comfortable in the
water is very important.

614
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:38,070
Water makes you better. Water makes you
a better person. And I'll tell you, I've

615
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,180
said this before and the seal teams,

616
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,520
one of the things that makes
us good in the seal teams,

617
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,460
we have to deal with water and
water is a pain in the ass.

618
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:46,980
It ruins things at floods,
things it stops,

619
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,340
it stops guns from working at stops
or radios from working at SOPs.

620
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:52,890
Humans from working,
you drown in it.

621
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,870
It's water is very tough to deal with.
It's a very harsh environment,

622
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:02,130
especially the ocean water. I, I used to
say that every time you go in the water,

623
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,660
it's a real world op.
Cause you can get killed,

624
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,040
you can be killed in the
ocean and you can get killed.

625
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,680
The ocean today if you
make the wrong moves.

626
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,840
So you definitely need to be comfortable
in the water. Now first things first,

627
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,230
water will kill you.
Water will kill you,

628
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,760
you will die. You don't, if you make
mistakes in the water, you will die.

629
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:29,330
So whoever is wrote this question and
whoever's going to heed my advice here,

630
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,610
note and be advised that water
will kill you. So when you swim,

631
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
you got to have a lifeguard. And
there's a couple examples, a guy, uh,

632
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:44,580
in mind that when I went through
seal training with who was a stud,

633
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,250
a complete stud,

634
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:52,251
he was the honor man of my
buds class and a great guy.

635
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:54,530
I mean, not just, I mean,
it's cool to be honor man,

636
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:55,770
that means you're a good athlete.
But he,

637
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:59,620
this guy was also beyond that was
just a great guy, extremely motivated.

638
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:00,750
[inaudible] name is Keith come euro.

639
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,290
And he was practicing breath holds
as he was in use as you know,

640
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,660
after we went through seal training and
he would get gone to a seal team and

641
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:17,661
served and he'd come back to be a seal
instructor and he was practicing breath

642
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:23,880
holds during a,
during an evolution for the students.

643
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,940
And while all that was going on,
you know,

644
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,070
they're doing stuff with the students
and he's down there practicing.

645
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:33,450
Raf holds on his own kind. He was
on his, well, he was in the group,

646
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,920
but on his own,
if that makes sense.

647
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,280
So there's a big evolution going on
and while this big evolution going on,

648
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:43,260
he's kind of doing his own thing.
Right, right, right. And he died.

649
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,960
He was doing breath holds.
He stayed down there.

650
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:49,710
He had a shallow water blackout and he,

651
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,840
he died and it was awful. I mean, what
a, what an incredible, incredible guy.

652
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:01,080
Um, we also had some seals, 2015,

653
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,400
um, that were in Virginia Beach, you know,

654
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,870
young studs getting after it,
training super hard and

655
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,090
okay,

656
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:16,390
they, they both died in, in, in a pool
in Virginia Beach. And again, you know,

657
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:17,420
these are frog men.

658
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,820
These guys are pushing
themselves and you know,

659
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,320
trying to make themselves better.

660
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,660
And they pushed that envelope
and that's what seals do.

661
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,950
And they pushed it and they went over
the line and unfortunately they were

662
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,020
training together at the same time.
So you gotta be,

663
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,730
you got,

664
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:41,731
don't train alone and don't train with
someone that's doing the same thing as

665
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:45,880
you. At the same, you can't yet Durer
the same thing together. You know,

666
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:48,310
it's a real, it's a real
simple rule to one up one down.

667
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,020
So if it's your turn to train,

668
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,830
I stay out and then you do your evolutions
and then when you're done, okay,

669
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,970
now it's my turn to train. You stay out
and you watch me. It's one up, one down.

670
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:01,720
That's the, that has to be the
standard. Again, people don't,

671
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,090
don't play around with the water.
You know,

672
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:08,980
I've had Shallow Water Blackouts and you
pee wee, they just come and that's it.

673
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,150
Your unconscious and, and if you, if
someone's not there to drag you out,

674
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,470
you're going to drown. You're
going to die. That's it. And
they, again, it's sort of,

675
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,250
you can tell that they're coming a
little bit and you get used to them,

676
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,910
but it's sort of like getting choked
out in Jujitsu. Yeah. You know,

677
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:27,130
you've been choked out before,
right? Yeah, many times. Yeah.

678
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:31,150
So you think you're gonna make
it? Yeah. And then you don't,

679
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,970
and you can push it too. That's the
thing, especially when you're training,

680
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,600
like when I'm trying to get stronger
at like chokes and you want to be,

681
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,410
if you have some fight in
you, you know you want to be
able to, to fight, you know,

682
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:44,140
so you push it a lot of times,
especially when you have experience,

683
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,320
push it a little bit and then
sometimes cause you just got to go,

684
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,130
you can feel the blackout coming but
once you go right past that point you're,

685
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,620
you can't tap anymore.
You go out, you know,

686
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,010
do you did to safe cause usually the guy
can fuel you go out and they let you go.

687
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:58,420
But I go in the water.

688
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,290
It's like you know what the event horizon
is and a black hole. Yeah that little,

689
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,360
there's a line.
If you go over that line you're done.

690
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,590
And that's exactly what happens
with your consciousness. You're you,

691
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,510
you can see that line. You're watching
it like oh I'm going to get, okay,

692
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:12,970
I'm going to make it. And then all of
sudden it's gone and you're over the line.

693
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,880
You're in the black hole and that's it.
So be very,

694
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:19,120
very careful when you're
doing this. Always have a swim
buddy, swim the lifeguard,

695
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:21,030
all that stuff.
Um,

696
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,280
now the question back to the question
beyond the safety portion is how do you

697
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,120
get more comfortable with water? You
spend time in the water, swim, surf,

698
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:36,250
spear fishing, snorkeling, scuba
diving, survival, floating breath holds,

699
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,200
treading water,
just d.

700
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,690
That's how you get comfortable in
the waters by being in the water.

701
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:41,710
Give yourself a little challenges.

702
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:45,010
Swim with swim with tee shirts and
your hands swim with your clothes on.

703
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,350
Swim Dee Dee,

704
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,220
jock while you're not just all those
things to get to be in the water and do

705
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,420
things and swim.

706
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:56,440
And that's how you get more comfortable
in the water and you'll rapidly increase

707
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,010
your ability to be in the water and
handle yourself in the water and you'll be

708
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:01,030
much more common than water.

709
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,720
And the reason I said this is a universal
question is because it's the same

710
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:06,970
thing with just about everything
else that you're going to do.

711
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,610
The same thing with swimming.
It's the same thing with doing.

712
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,440
You want to get going to pull ups,
do more bobs.

713
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,360
You want to get better at public speaking,

714
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,450
get up and start doing public speaking.
Same thing with shooting.

715
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:19,630
Like when people first start shooting
and they're all intimidated by firearms,

716
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,600
it's because they're not used to them.
So spend time shooting,

717
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:25,130
spend time around guns.
You'll get used to the muzzle flash.

718
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,840
It used to look concussion of the noise
and you will be more comfortable about

719
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,360
it. So that's what you
needed to do in the water.

720
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,330
You spend more time in the water
and and you'll get better at it.

721
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:39,590
You'll get more comfortable. But again, be
careful when you're doing it. The water,

722
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:44,210
the water will kill you.
What does de Jock me? Oh, uh,

723
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,000
it's a term that's as far as I know,

724
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:52,001
it comes from buds from seal training
where when you put your scuba gear on,

725
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,620
they call it jocking up.

726
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,630
So joc up and your guarantee
in the seal teams it becomes,

727
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,960
it's a term that means any type
of getting your clothes on,

728
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:07,280
you're getting your gear on, getting
your clothes on, getting dressed,

729
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,600
putting your jock strap on that.
I don't know what it is.

730
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,750
I don't know if that's where
it comes from. I think you can.

731
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:15,501
But they used to play,

732
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:20,000
you know they remember that like little
kids game hang man where you fill in the

733
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:24,830
letters. Well whenever the class
would make a mistake they would put,

734
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:29,831
they'd have jock up written on the board
and they'd put one letter in and then

735
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:35,000
when you spelled out all of jock up,
then they would make you do joc up drills,

736
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,290
which are not fun, but it's just
putting on stuff. Your gear. Yes.

737
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:44,291
But the jock up drills
involve ridiculously stupid
and hard calisthenic workouts

738
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:53,370
with your entire gear load out
or they would always, we used to,

739
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,430
you know what bear
crawling is. Yeah. Yeah.

740
00:42:55,431 --> 00:43:00,431
So you had to bear crawl with twin 72
tanks on we bear crawl to the Chow Hall.

741
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,300
I mean it's a mile. He's, I think our,

742
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:09,800
I think our instructors got in trouble
for making us bear crawl with he. Yeah,

743
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,100
they were like the Geneva Convention
called it's a borough. No.

744
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,160
Yeah, we had to pick or
call in football. We had to,

745
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,750
there was an incident in camp
in football at Uah one time

746
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,290
where we were supposed to
be, you know, sleeping,

747
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,440
you know, lights out, whatever. And

748
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,280
the guy who will remain,

749
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,940
now his name is [inaudible]
[inaudible] is like when I was young,

750
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,180
I was like a freshman to wall
off the one guy and he, um, I,

751
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,080
I can say his name now cause
he admitted it afterwards.

752
00:43:47,081 --> 00:43:51,760
But before they're allies, we would
add to keep his car totally classified.

753
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:55,540
Tupo get an afternoon to
under what do you do? W okay,

754
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:59,500
so people were messing about,
we're supposed to be in bed,

755
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:03,880
so security comes or whatever.
And like we, and one hide,
some say we, uh, wasn't me.

756
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:08,260
I wasn't doing it. And someone threw a
sandwich at the security guard, hit him.

757
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,190
And it was this big incident, the
sat, you know, in and of itself,

758
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,350
throwing sandwiches, a security guard.
This is more funny than anything,

759
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,840
but we're supposed to be in bed,
you know, we're a football team.

760
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:21,040
You can't do that, you know? So it
was like, Hey, who? Who was this?

761
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,500
If no one admits it,
everyone's going to get punished.

762
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,010
So of course everyone gets punished.
We're doing bear crawls across,

763
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,280
across the field nonstop.
So he was like,

764
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,230
I can relate to the bear crawl to
the Chow Hall. It wasn't like, okay,

765
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:37,200
bear crawl to here. And then it
was like, you're going all the way.

766
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:40,680
I don't even know how many times
we did it. One guy was like,

767
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:45,660
cry was crying. So this up,
whoever did it fits up crying.

768
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,130
Grown men cry. I don't like that guy.
Nonetheless. So yeah, bear called.

769
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:51,900
That's rough man. Bear crawls, no joke.

770
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,740
But I think jockeying up is because you
wear your jock start when you get in the

771
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:58,560
game, like a jockstrap jock. You know,

772
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,940
maybe one of the old Udt guys that
listens to the podcast will contact me and

773
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:07,560
let me know where Jack up came
from. Yeah, that's my money on that.

774
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:12,510
It's because of jock gearing this up.
Joc shop is like the manly, you know,

775
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:17,420
I'm not telling, not going down this
road. I'm already down the road.

776
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,520
Can't help that you dragging me along,
but I'm not going to agree with you.

777
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:24,640
Think you're wrong. All right.
There you go. You have that right?

778
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,580
Yeah.
Here you go.

779
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,010
Next question.
Yeah.

780
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,230
Let's go to the next question and
I talk about that one anymore.

781
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,920
You're losing me on it.

782
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,700
What's the dichotomy in having an ego?

783
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:43,010
When is it good and when does he get to
a point where you have to check your ego?

784
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:45,180
Okay.

785
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,800
Okay, so did I caught
him? He is pretty clear.

786
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:55,170
Um, ego drives you. Absolutely.

787
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:57,780
It makes you want to win.
It makes you want to perform well at,

788
00:45:57,781 --> 00:46:02,730
makes you proud of your achievements,
makes you want to be number one.

789
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,570
And those are all good things.
And I fully,

790
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:10,560
fully have those myself.
I mean,

791
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:15,590
my ego will keep me up at night trying
to win at some ridiculously meaningless

792
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:18,990
thing in the world.
Especially when I was younger.

793
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,210
It was kind of stupid.
Um,

794
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,130
but the ego can also get you in
trouble or get you in trouble really,

795
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,240
really quickly. For
instance, I mean you can,

796
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:38,241
your ego can make you sabotage
your coworker that's all
on the same team as you

797
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,600
so that you can shine
them, right? That's ego.

798
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,900
You can vote down a plan,

799
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,850
a better plan because
that plan isn't yours.

800
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,640
That's your ego.
You can

801
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,550
chase some material items,

802
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,930
some things,
something that you don't really need.

803
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:07,920
Maybe in some cases it might
even be something that you
don't actually even want.

804
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:14,010
And it's just fueling your ego, which is,
which is a really bizarre thing to see.

805
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,490
It can make you step on your subordinates,
right?

806
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,020
It can make you undercut your
peers cause that ego flares up.

807
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,910
It can make you,
your ego can make you dig in,

808
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,120
dig in on stupid ideas that you've had.

809
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:36,010
Those are the kinds of things that ego
to, and all those things are negative. So

810
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,030
that's pretty clear to me where
ego starts going sideways.

811
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:47,770
And, and I would say, even though like my
ego is fueled me to, to, to want to win,

812
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,200
but I'd never was that out
of control where I was like,

813
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:54,070
screw and screwing people over because
I wanted to win. No, I wouldn't do that.

814
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,010
That wasn't part of my personality wasn't,
I'm not that.

815
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,290
Plus I was never really
naturally good at much.

816
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,280
So it wasn't like I was going to win.

817
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,340
The only way I could beat people and
things was outworking them. Yeah.

818
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,170
Other than that I, it
would be hard for me. Yeah.

819
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:12,310
Usually that kind of person who like you,
well then the two kinds of people,

820
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:17,311
one who is down to like screw someone
over or basically cheat cheating is what

821
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:21,280
you're doing. And it's
like, I want to be here.

822
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,400
They don't necessarily want to quote
unquote win because if you cheat,

823
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,020
it's not really winning.
You know,

824
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:29,380
the whole benefit of winning is like
overcoming certain things, you know?

825
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,350
But when you cheat, it's like, you know,
and you cheated, you know, whatever.

826
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,050
So it's less about,

827
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:40,540
it's more about you understanding really
what winning is and that's what you

828
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:44,620
like the winning, you know? Yes, yes.

829
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,590
So like people who undermine,
cheat and do this stuff,

830
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,590
it's like they don't want to win.
I was like a good case in point.

831
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,390
I remember when when I was going
to seal training, there was people,

832
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,210
there was guys that
would like brag about it.

833
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:00,750
They were going through the same seal
training class and me saying buds,

834
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:01,271
class and me.

835
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:05,290
But they would like brag about it and
like you could hear him talking to let's

836
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,050
say some random person. Yeah.
We're on the seal training.

837
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,170
I wasn't bragging about that holds
like, hey man, I'm a lucky I'm here.

838
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:16,950
And I realize that a lot of those people
quit because they were comfortable.

839
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:22,330
They just being able to say like seal
training. They were already good with it.

840
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,650
They were like, Oh yeah, I did what
I'm supposed to do. So me, I'll, I'll,

841
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:30,010
I didn't want to do that. I didn't want
to say anything until I made it through.

842
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,280
Yeah. And so, um, yeah, so,

843
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:35,740
so what I'm saying is similar
to what you're saying,

844
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,300
they were satisfied just by being
able to throw that out there,

845
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,590
that was enough for them.

846
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,210
So for someone that's willing
to cheat and when are there eat,

847
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,500
they're willing to step on someone.
It doesn't feel good to me,

848
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,630
it has never felt good to me.
Like if I got to step on someone,

849
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:52,450
I don't even want it. I don't
want that victory, don't want it.

850
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,710
So it's like they want to,

851
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:59,080
some people want to look like they won
and other people want to really win. Yeah,

852
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,440
of course. That's really the
difference. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

853
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,230
So back to ego point,

854
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,500
when you start feeling like you're
doing some of those negative things,

855
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,430
that's when you've got
to put your ego in check.

856
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:18,560
That's what you got to support
your coworker instead of sabotage.

857
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:22,150
And that's when you got to pick the best
plan out there instead of picking your

858
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:24,640
own. That's when you
say, do you know what?

859
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:29,670
I'm happy with what I have in state of
chasing things that I don't even need.

860
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,670
You know what I'm talking about,
what people like if you were,

861
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,970
there's been something that you wanted
even though you actually didn't even

862
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:41,930
really want to put, you just want it just
cause you, cause it's pure ego. Pure Ego.

863
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,690
Yeah. Like when you're in the weight room,
well growing up like lifting weights,

864
00:50:46,691 --> 00:50:49,430
some guys would do this where they'd be
lifting weights and you can see a lot of

865
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:50,264
times in these like,

866
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:55,010
like a 24 hour fitness situation
where you'd be lived guys,

867
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:58,100
we'll be lifting weights. And
then one guy was, he's like, Dang,

868
00:50:58,101 --> 00:50:59,180
he's lifting kind of a lot.

869
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,790
You'll see someone all of a sudden
be doing that same exercise,

870
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,640
like trying to live more than that.
He doesn't know him not lifting with him.

871
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:07,100
He wasn't even doing that exercise.
So it wasn't even his workup.

872
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:10,340
But he'll try to do it, you know? But
you weren't even doing that exercise.

873
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,140
You weren't doing bench today and now
you're doing bench chasing something you

874
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:16,270
don't even want,
don't even want it.

875
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,240
They don't need it that day.
Uh,

876
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,780
that's another big one is like
when I talk about subordinates,

877
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,600
instead of cutting down your subordinates,
you start lifting them up,

878
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,660
you start making them shine,
you start giving them the credit,

879
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:33,070
making them shine even
brighter than yourself. That's,

880
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,290
that's the beautiful thing.

881
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,690
When you can put your ego in check
and you can make that happen.

882
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:42,940
Making your own boss look good,
having an open mind to new ideas.

883
00:51:42,941 --> 00:51:45,550
Those are the things.
That's how you put your ego in.

884
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:49,270
Check those or the things that

885
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,980
those are the, those are the
hallmarks of having your ego in check.

886
00:51:55,981 --> 00:52:00,130
Now sometimes people don't know when
they need to put their ego in check.

887
00:52:00,131 --> 00:52:05,131
And I think there's one really easy
indicator to know when you need to just at

888
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:09,970
least like do an assessment of your ego.

889
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:15,030
And that is when you're coming to
conflict with another person cause cause a

890
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,600
huge percentage of conflicts that
you have with other people. Our Ego,

891
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:24,490
our their ego.
And so when you feel that conflict,

892
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:27,760
whether it's about positioning,
whether it's about an idea,

893
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:30,970
whether it's about a plan, whether it's
about, well, no matter what it's about,

894
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:35,980
but if I'm in conflict with you on
something, immediately I'm going to say,

895
00:52:35,981 --> 00:52:39,070
okay, what does that going? Is
this your ego talking or are you,

896
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,200
is is this business or is this ego?

897
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:46,200
And if you do that, you will
find yourself, you know,

898
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:51,210
any form of frustration
or anger that you have.

899
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,610
Just check your ego and there's a good
chance that you're going to be able to

900
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:58,090
take that thing, get ahold of it and
aggressively put it in check. It's hard.

901
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,000
Your ego is a tough
bastard. Your Ego, man,

902
00:53:01,001 --> 00:53:04,780
that thing wants the spotlight.
It wants to shine,

903
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,780
it wants the glory and
it's, it's driven. You know,

904
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,620
that's a lot of high achievers out there.
That's what's driving you.

905
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,730
And that's not a bad thing. So when
it comes time to harness that bad boy,

906
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:20,260
it can be a challenge, but it's very
rewarding when you make it happen.

907
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,670
It's,
it's rewarding in a long term.

908
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,850
It's not immediate gratification.
Yeah. Generally, you know you're given,

909
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,010
you're given your subordinates
to all the credit for some,

910
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,660
for some project that they did.

911
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,850
You know that you could actually know
that you did the bulk of the work.

912
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:43,290
Would you give it away? That's
not gratifying. Immediately
immediately is like,

913
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:46,020
yeah, that's right. Put
the accolades on my head.

914
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,840
That's immediate gratification that
you're looking for. No. You say, Hey boss,

915
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:54,840
you know what? Don't put the
accolades on my head. Look at my team.

916
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,530
Let's crown them cause they really did
a great job and I'm just here to help

917
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:00,690
them.
There's no gratification in that,

918
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:06,000
but when you get feed back a week
later, a month later, six months later,

919
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,830
people want to come
and work for your team.

920
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,630
Now your team gets picked
for another project.

921
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:14,160
That's the long term gratification that
you get when you keep your ego in check.

922
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,203
Yeah.

923
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:19,690
You

924
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,100
that ego in check.
People meal.

925
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:27,750
This year I took extreme ownership over
every detail and mistake on a of the

926
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:29,170
roofing company I was starting.

927
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,030
But instead of inspiring my employees,

928
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:37,350
they just got entitled because of the,
because of this,

929
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:41,340
the business almost ran into the ground.
In addition,

930
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:45,660
I got so worn down then my resolve
almost collapsed. In your estimation,

931
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:46,530
what did I do wrong?

932
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,150
So this is an example.
I don't see this all the time,

933
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:59,040
but I do see it sometimes and
what we have here is, you know,

934
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:02,730
clearly guy steps up and says, you
know what, I'm going to take ownership.

935
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:03,840
I'm taking extreme ownership,

936
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:07,830
which is what I'm always encouraging
people to do life. And I wrote the book,

937
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,910
we called the book extreme ownership
because that is the fundamental principle

938
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,870
that we see as the common trait that
makes people successful is when they're

939
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:17,550
taking ownership instead
of blaming other people.

940
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,340
So that's what this guy did
with the roofing company,

941
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:22,020
Ham and take ownership
of all the mistakes.

942
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:27,960
Now the problem there is with the,
the,

943
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:30,060
the concept of extreme ownership.

944
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:34,950
It means taking ownership of the mistakes,

945
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,360
taking ownership of the problems.
But it doesn't stop there.

946
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:45,140
That is simply where you start because
the real true ownership that you need to

947
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:51,801
take as you need to take extreme ownership
of the solutions of implementing the

948
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,130
solutions of creating and
implementing the solutions.

949
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,710
That's what you need to take ownership of.
So in a situation like this,

950
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,830
like for instance, Oh, I
took ownership of everything,

951
00:56:01,831 --> 00:56:06,360
so my team became entitled
now, now first of all,

952
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:10,200
in in that statement, in its
own right, if I say, hey,

953
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:14,010
we failed because my team became
entitled, what did I just do? Blame them.

954
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,190
I blame them for becoming entitled.
Why did they become entitled?

955
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,370
I allowed them to,
what am I going to do solve that?

956
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:22,230
I either have to train
the am treating them.

957
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,040
Maybe there's a couple of cancers in there

958
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,030
that have that attitude.

959
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:29,620
I need to fire those people or replace
them or get them retrained or put some

960
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:34,240
ownership on them so that they realize,
oh, okay, oh, I'm going to get,

961
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,410
I'm going to lose my job if we're,

962
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,480
we're going to fail this mission or
the companies go out of business.

963
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:42,460
If I don't do this right, so you got
to, that's the mistake there. What do I,

964
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,700
so you've identified the problem, you
take taking ownership of it. Hey we, hey,

965
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:48,790
we got to make sure we get our
jobs done on time. Okay boss,

966
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:51,790
well you didn't order the gear and time
and you didn't do this and now we're

967
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:54,100
behind. So it's not our
fault. You, and by the way,

968
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:57,970
pay me if that's the attitude
your employees, have you
got a problem as leader.

969
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:02,260
So what is the problem? How
do you fix that problem? Um,

970
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,600
the,
the,

971
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:06,000
yeah,

972
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,560
the thing is about ownership is taking
ownership of the problem doesn't fix the

973
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:13,560
problem, right? It
doesn't fix the problem.

974
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,050
You still have to come
up with the solution. So

975
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,670
that's what it is.
When we talk about extreme ownership,

976
00:57:23,671 --> 00:57:26,910
we're definitely not just talking about
owning the problems, but like I said,

977
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:31,230
owning the solutions and owning the
implementation and actually carry to,

978
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,030
it's to,

979
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:38,031
it's furthest stretched
to its furthest outcome.

980
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,110
That's where you have to
take extreme ownership is of,

981
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:41,970
and this is the most important part.

982
00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:44,850
And obviously I need to make this clear
enough because this should be something

983
00:57:44,851 --> 00:57:47,340
that everyone fundamentally understands
when they talk about extreme ownership.

984
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:52,580
The most important part for you to own
as a leader is the outcome is the end

985
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:58,500
state.
If you are not meeting your end state,

986
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:02,130
that's what you have to take ownership of.
That's what you have to make happen,

987
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:07,110
so that's it. You know when your,

988
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:09,210
when your company's not
doing the right thing. Yeah.

989
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:11,760
You got to take ownership of the
mistakes that happened. You got,

990
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,220
you got employees that are
acting wrong. Yeah. Hey,

991
00:58:14,221 --> 00:58:18,210
it's my fault that they're acting wrong.
You got deadlines at, you're missing gas.

992
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:19,980
It's my fault that we
missed the deadlines.

993
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:22,170
Now you got to go back and
ask yourself the question,

994
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,380
how do I make the deadlines?
How do I fix those employees?

995
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,200
You got to solve those problems
that are out there. Otherwise,

996
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:29,670
extreme ownership doesn't
do anything for you,

997
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,840
and we've talked about this before
as well and that is that it's taking

998
00:58:33,841 --> 00:58:38,730
ownership of things is not a,
it's not a a shelter,

999
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,640
right? It's not, it doesn't
provide shelter. Yeah.

1000
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:44,680
It doesn't it and some people think it
does. They go, hey, you know what? Hey,

1001
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:48,210
we missed or we missed the we, we
failed on our mission. It's my fault.

1002
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,090
Okay, so let's move on. No, no,
no, actually no, we don't move on.

1003
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,930
You failed in your mission. How
are you going to fix it? Yeah.

1004
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:01,380
Extreme ownership does not,
does not give you any mercy whatsoever.

1005
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,950
That's what's hard about it, and
by the way, the thing that lifting,

1006
00:59:04,951 --> 00:59:09,720
that extreme ownership that makes it
hard is because the previous question,

1007
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:13,710
it attacks your ego because when
you say, hey guys, this is my fault.

1008
00:59:13,711 --> 00:59:17,280
You're not just saying, hey guys,
this is my fault. Let's move on.

1009
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,280
You're saying this is truly my fault.

1010
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:24,070
We failed because of me and these
are the things we're going to do.

1011
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,680
Fix it and I'm going to own it until
we get it done. Yeah. Dang. Yeah,

1012
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:30,200
that it kind of makes sense.

1013
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:34,930
Like it is one of those all or nothing
things you know were extremely, he can,

1014
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:38,360
it's just funny how you put it.
You know, where you're like,

1015
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,200
I did my extreme ownership.
The rest is up to you guys kind of thing.

1016
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,330
He can't really do that.
And this question is, is,

1017
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,130
is a really good question and I appreciate
it because you can see the guy that

1018
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:54,080
asked it, he clearly is motivated,
wants to do well, but he, he,

1019
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,290
I, but again, my fault for not
explaining this well enough,

1020
00:59:57,350 --> 01:00:01,220
he fought that just taking ownership
would solve the problem. No,

1021
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,960
you have to take ownership and
solve the problem. Matter of fact,

1022
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,560
that taking ownership part is the initial
part that lets the rest of it happen.

1023
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,700
And, and that's why we emphasize
it so much because most people,

1024
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,900
they just don't take on it. They're
not even close. This guy, he's close,

1025
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,230
he's taken ownership. Now he's got
to realize, okay, I took ownership,

1026
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,090
I realized that it's my fault. And again,
it's not just him saying, uh, well it's,

1027
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,320
it's my company so it's my fault.
And so I hope this works out. No,

1028
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:34,160
I don't hope anything. You fix it.
You make it happen. And I, again,

1029
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:37,940
I appreciate this question because I
could see in his earnest asking of the

1030
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:41,720
question like, he's like, man, what
did I do wrong? What did I do wrong?

1031
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,650
Here's what you did wrong. You
know you, you made the first step,

1032
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:47,840
which is the hardest step.
That's the positive here.

1033
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,530
One of the most positive things about
this guy is he's made the hardest step,

1034
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,990
which is, okay, this is my fault.

1035
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,490
The follow on is what he missed.
Now how do I fix it?

1036
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:02,420
What do I do to implement it? You got
lacks of days, nickel entitled employees.

1037
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,450
That is your fault.
So how do you fix them?

1038
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,120
Because if you're lackadaisical
and entitled around me,

1039
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:10,220
that means I'm doing something wrong. I
mean, if you don't understand the mission,

1040
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:11,660
you don't understand why
we're doing what we're doing.

1041
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,480
You don't understand why it's important
to meet the deadline on this roof so we

1042
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:17,630
can move on to another one so that we can
collect money to pay for our next one.

1043
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,000
There's all kinds of reasons that you
could tell people why these things are

1044
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:21,770
important.
And if you have people that you,

1045
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:24,800
they know exactly why they're doing
what they're doing and they still aren't

1046
01:01:24,801 --> 01:01:27,740
getting in the game, you need to find
some more people to come and work for you.

1047
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,390
Some different people,

1048
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,700
some people would better attitudes
and bring them on board with the right

1049
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:34,520
attitude. You have this, um,

1050
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:40,900
even to add to why this is such a good
question is this is exactly what people

1051
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:45,470
are scared of with the extreme
ownership. It's like, Dang,

1052
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:47,930
if I take extreme
ownership over everything,

1053
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,240
they're going to take advantage
or they're gonna, you know,

1054
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:54,110
be entitled or whatever. I think,
I mean, even thinking about it,

1055
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,850
that's what I'd be afraid of. I am afraid
of, you know, and, and I will tell you,

1056
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:03,650
having done this my whole career,
when you take ownership of things,

1057
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,320
people don't there.
There is a small chance,

1058
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:09,740
there's a couple of knuckleheads like
these idiots at this guy has working for

1059
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:11,480
him that are entitled.
Now,

1060
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:16,481
I shouldn't say that because he may have
provided the environment to become like

1061
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:19,980
he might've been the easy button
and every time they say, hey boss,

1062
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:22,290
I can't fit a boss.
I can't come in late today.

1063
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:26,590
Can you finish up that roof by yourself
and who? He's like, Hey, you know what?

1064
01:02:26,591 --> 01:02:29,100
I'm going to take ownership
of this, right? He goes, okay,
I'm gonna take ownership.

1065
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:32,430
Don't worry about it. I got it. Now
he does that four days in a row.

1066
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:36,510
He's worked 16 hour days. He started
to get broken mentally and physically.

1067
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:39,960
You ever done roofing before? [inaudible]
roofing? Yeah. Yeah. That's hard work.

1068
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:44,400
Especially in the summertime when the
blazing sun eat 1416 hour day I had to do,

1069
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,720
I pulled a chimney off my
little chimney off my roof.

1070
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:50,880
One time I thought I was Neil
just patched the roof. No,

1071
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:54,840
I had to strip like a third of my roof
on my house and then I'm up there.

1072
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:57,480
We got rainstorms coming. I'm
up there and okay, I got a roof,

1073
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:02,250
this whole thing and the next one
is an 18 hours. Get some. Yeah.

1074
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,470
So roofing is hard work.
And if,

1075
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,170
if you don't take the,
if you don't,

1076
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,090
if you don't get these
employees in the right mindset,

1077
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:16,290
if they're not part of the
team, if they're not on
board, how you gonna fix that?

1078
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:16,621
If you,

1079
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:19,770
and what I was going to say is if you
become the easy button all the time,

1080
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:24,180
then that allows them, it fosters
the attitude of, hey, you know what,

1081
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:29,370
uh, this is on Jocko. He's the one that
he's still got to pay me. Like, no,

1082
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:31,110
actually here,
let me tell you how it really works.

1083
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,600
You know how I pay you
regardless of what you do. Well,

1084
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,780
eventually I don't pay you
anything because you don't
work here and I don't have

1085
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:38,790
a business anymore.
So if that's where you're at,

1086
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,360
Donald wants you here and I
will do this myself and I'll,

1087
01:03:41,361 --> 01:03:44,070
I'll schedule my job's appropriately
so I can do it all myself.

1088
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:48,330
If you want to get in the game and be
part of this team, which you should,

1089
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:53,760
then this is what I need from you.
Here's the expectations. This is why,

1090
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,180
because next year,
this year we did 14 roofs.

1091
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:01,530
Next year I want to do double that and
that means I'm gonna get you a crew

1092
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:03,870
that's going to work for you and you're
gonna bump your pay up a little bit.

1093
01:04:03,871 --> 01:04:06,090
I'm going to get you moving
along and get you promoted.

1094
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,820
Maybe sometime you'll have two
or three teams working for you.

1095
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:12,090
Do you want to do that or do you want
to continue being the guy that's hauling

1096
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:16,140
shingles all day? Are you in the game
with me or not? Are you part of this Gig?

1097
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,510
See,
so you got to get in their heads.

1098
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:23,430
You got to get them out of that mindset
and into the right mindset so that you

1099
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:28,080
can dominate. Yeah. I feel
like that extreme ownership
kind of provides that to,

1100
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,840
you know where if like
how you've always said,

1101
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:33,990
if you're like blaming them overtly,
blaming them, they're like, oh,

1102
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,480
this is good and not on my team. They
have that feeling, but if they're like,

1103
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:39,550
if he's taking the responsibility,
it's like, Oh Dang this kid.

1104
01:04:39,551 --> 01:04:43,680
It's kind of on my team. Yeah. I do want
to do all that classic exit. You're right.

1105
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,700
Classic example. If I approach
you and I'm like, Echo Dude,

1106
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,320
you're just entitled, you are entitled,
you don't have a good attitude.

1107
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,310
What attitude do you have now? Yeah.
What? What attitude do you have now?

1108
01:04:56,311 --> 01:05:00,210
Now you're like, oh, what are you talking
about? I'm entitled, I'm entitled. Yeah,

1109
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:02,310
you're damn right. I'm entitled
because look at what I've been doing.

1110
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:06,270
I've been no. Whereas if I, if I take a
different approach with you and say, man,

1111
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:09,280
look, I think you've got a
lot of potential. You know,
I think you got a lot of, no,

1112
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:11,760
you got a lot of things going on at home
and I know you've got that girlfriend

1113
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:13,800
and I know you're doing this and that,
but you know what?

1114
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,260
I think you've got some potential here.
Let me tell you what it's going to lead.

1115
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:17,980
You know,
I know you don't want to be carrying

1116
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,190
shingles were asked your life and
on your knees smacking nails, right?

1117
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,240
But maybe you could be running a
crew and this is how I want to grow.

1118
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:28,060
Do you kind of want to get in the
game with me? Cause I think you might.

1119
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,390
You see what I'm saying? That's all
it takes. You understand me? Yes.

1120
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,400
Good question. Thanks. And
Good luck with that company.

1121
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:41,830
Small business owners get getting after.
It's hard. Running a small business.

1122
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:46,000
It's hard work. You are, the buck stops
with you whether you like it or not.

1123
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,730
Because even if you, hey,
you know what you mean?

1124
01:05:47,731 --> 01:05:50,470
If you don't want to take
extreme ownership, if you're
a small business owner,

1125
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:56,050
eventually you're going to get put on
you. It's on you, it is on you. So it's,

1126
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,900
it's uh, it's great. I love,

1127
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,530
I love the small business owners getting
after it out there. Next question.

1128
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:07,630
Thoughts on how to deal with
toxic slash negative people?

1129
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:13,810
Oh, those people. Yeah. So first of all,

1130
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:18,900
it's important to recognize that those
people exist everywhere and everybody's

1131
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:21,310
got to deal with me.
If you run into one of these people,

1132
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:27,060
don't get all surprised as if they're
a lone ranger out there being negative.

1133
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,250
No, there's negative
rangers all over the place.

1134
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:33,430
So we gotta do you gotta
know how to deal with them?

1135
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:38,650
And it's so, so when you're dealing
with someone like that, first of all,

1136
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:44,290
confronting them, of course,
as you can probably predict,

1137
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:47,920
is not usually the best option
because all you're doing is you're,

1138
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,280
you're attacking their heavily defended
position, which, which is not good.

1139
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:56,460
So one of the techniques that I use when
dealing with these kind of people is I

1140
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,410
absorb,

1141
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:03,670
I absorb their critiques,

1142
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:08,680
I absorb their toxicity,
I absorb their negativity.

1143
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,780
Now obviously this takes a
little bit of strength, right?

1144
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,850
You can't be taking stuff personally.
You have to,

1145
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,860
in order to learn how to absorb
thing, you gotta say, okay,

1146
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:19,480
I'm just going doing this for the
team. Right? But it looks like,

1147
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:25,210
for instance, when they say, oh,
this is horrible. I don't say, no,

1148
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:29,260
it's not horrible. I don't just go right
back at them. I say, yeah, you know what?

1149
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:32,450
We definitely got some room
for improvement, right?
So I kind of just deflect.

1150
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,520
I kind of just absorb, absorb it,
right? It was sore, but a little bit.

1151
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:38,770
Because what they want to do
is they're lashing out, right?

1152
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,470
They're throwing the negativity.
They liked those explosions.

1153
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:44,490
They like to see it hit something and
blow up. They, that's what they're doing.

1154
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,670
That's how they roll.
So you're going to absorb,

1155
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:49,420
you gonna catch it and pull it
in. Right? So when they're like,

1156
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,480
we can never do this, I don't say
we can absolutely do this. No,

1157
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:56,710
cause you didn't.
You're just going,

1158
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,650
you're going to create the explosion that
they're looking for in San. I'm saying,

1159
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:02,280
you know what? We might not be able
to do it. I'm going to give it a,

1160
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,440
I'm going to give it a good solid try. I'm
going to try and make it happen, right?

1161
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:08,560
So we're just deflected a little bit
and they're going to show you some other

1162
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,570
negative thing. And you
know, if they say, oh,

1163
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:17,450
this is stupid, I don't say no, this is
the most brilliant thing I've ever seen.

1164
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:21,710
I don't do that. No. Go head to head.
I'm going to say, you know what,

1165
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:26,060
there's definitely some room
for improvement the next
time around. You're right.

1166
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:28,460
100% oh yeah.

1167
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:33,380
You just got deflected
and those reactions,

1168
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:37,910
they disarm these ultra
negative people and

1169
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:42,700
it kind of takes their,
their fight from the,

1170
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:47,701
and it also makes them look
like emotional extremists.

1171
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,400
So with the group, right, when somebody
calls that out in the group, they,

1172
01:08:51,401 --> 01:08:54,650
they're common across all extreme and
you just absorb it and negate it a little

1173
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:57,630
bit.
It negates their view or it,

1174
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:00,860
I shouldn't say negate cause negate me
is like totally Latins and cross out when

1175
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:04,660
you just absorb it and deflected a little
bit, the rest of the team goes on. Yeah.

1176
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,520
You know, Oh echo, he's just super
emotional and he's a negative.

1177
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:12,410
They see him for what he is,
which is helpful for you.

1178
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,340
Right.

1179
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:17,930
And then once I'm done absorbing their
attacks and taking some of those shots,

1180
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:22,430
no big deal that I'm going to start
to override them somewhat with some,

1181
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,930
with some positivity, which is
going to be directed at them. Right.

1182
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:29,920
So they were all negative,
but I'm going to say, Hey,

1183
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:34,290
what you did there really work well or
you know what? Hey you good job on that.

1184
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:35,011
I didn't know that.
I didn't care.

1185
01:09:35,011 --> 01:09:37,580
I never could have figured
that out like you did. Right.

1186
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:42,700
So I'm going to start getting in their
head a little bit and start filling their

1187
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:46,190
head with some positive stuff. That's
right. That's what I'm going to do. Bad.

1188
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,240
You figured that out better than anybody.
Nicely done.

1189
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,580
And I'm bringing them

1190
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:57,500
from the dark side over to the light.
That's what I'm doing.

1191
01:09:57,501 --> 01:10:02,050
I'm bringing them over. And actually
I used to have the funniest up, uh,

1192
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:05,660
one of my favorite guys in the seal teams.

1193
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,830
He was my,
he was my first deployment to Iraq.

1194
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:13,590
He was the senior enlisted guy
in our task. And it's, and,

1195
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,240
and actually we're just boroughs.

1196
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:21,800
But when one of us would start getting a
little off the reservation on something,

1197
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:25,340
like getting all addicted to some idea
or something, the other one we would,

1198
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,980
we would be looking like
I'd be telling them, look,

1199
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:30,080
we need to do this and this is bullshit.
We need to do.

1200
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:33,080
And he looked at me like he'd be like,
come back,

1201
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,300
come back to the life where over here
it's okay. We're all going to be okay.

1202
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:39,980
So when I would start getting negative,

1203
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:43,010
he would start pulling me
back to the light. Right.
And same thing with, with me,

1204
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:45,680
with him, he would get, he
would get all, you know,

1205
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:51,790
get all matter of fact he's
the guy, remember when we
talked about will simplify,

1206
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:56,810
repeat, no. Simplify, amplify and
repeat. That's it. Yeah, that's it.

1207
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,140
He would also have to bring me back from
the dark side and I have to do it to

1208
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:03,390
him too if he started getting
a little too negative. Um,

1209
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:07,340
good times. But the, the,

1210
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:11,240
the last thing I want to do with someone
that's being super negative is I am

1211
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:13,830
actually want to,
I want to give them some ownership.

1212
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,970
I want to give them some ownership,
some ability to make changes,

1213
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:23,210
some ability to have some kind of
a positive impact on the mission.

1214
01:11:23,731 --> 01:11:27,510
So I'm going to pick something that I
think they can step up and handle, right?

1215
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:32,511
Something that is within their grasp and
realm and ability and I'm going to give

1216
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,790
it to them and,
and then I'm going to give them,

1217
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:39,810
I'm going to give them one to kind
of overload them with help and with

1218
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:43,620
assistance and with guidance
to make sure that they win

1219
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:49,080
and that's going to start spinning them
in a more positive direction. Yeah.

1220
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:55,010
So that's my way to deal with the
big negative people out there.

1221
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:58,860
Just absorb and slowly counter.

1222
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:02,460
I liked it how you're maybe like,
like how you figured that out,

1223
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:07,230
and I said this before, but a good
one is to be like to say, hey,

1224
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:10,740
that's what I like about you. You're
real whatever, x, Y, z. You know,

1225
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:13,470
even that feeling like,
because people said that to me.

1226
01:12:13,471 --> 01:12:15,420
That's what I like about you.
You're real whatever,

1227
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,530
you know and it makes you want to
like continue to be that you know,

1228
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,840
and you're like, Hey, he thinks
I'm, you know, a problem solver.

1229
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:26,460
Someone who I'm going to be aware and
to continue to solve problems. You know,

1230
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:30,450
you put the self fulfilling prophecy in
their own heads and positive things that

1231
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:34,770
you want them to do. Exactly.
Yeah. That's a good times.

1232
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:39,850
Jocko. Next question. The
next question, Johnson do it.

1233
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:43,440
I'm an I n t j personality,

1234
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,760
my drive slash ideas often
cause friction with superiors.

1235
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,180
How can I use my strengths
without creating division?

1236
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,310
Okay. I uh, so for this one
I, I kind of had to look up

1237
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:04,020
this stuff to remember exactly what it
was and the like the I and j t r I n t j

1238
01:13:05,021 --> 01:13:05,854
stuff is

1239
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,130
in introverted intuitive thinking,
judging. This is part of this um,

1240
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:17,720
Meyers Briggs type indicator that
refers to one of 16 psychological types,

1241
01:13:19,001 --> 01:13:19,181
right?

1242
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:24,181
So it's sort of a graph that you can
figure out these what type of of 16

1243
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:31,060
different psychological
types that there are. And so,

1244
01:13:31,061 --> 01:13:32,800
so for this one in particular,

1245
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:36,910
this I n j t which like
I said is introverted,

1246
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:42,390
intuitive thinking and judging and I went
to the interwebs for this and it said

1247
01:13:45,941 --> 01:13:48,840
that as an I n Tj,

1248
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:55,240
your primary mode of living is focused
internal air internally where you take

1249
01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:59,380
things in primarily via your intuition,

1250
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:04,240
your secondary mode is external where
you deal with things rationally and

1251
01:14:04,241 --> 01:14:07,030
logically.
So

1252
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:12,190
speaking of self prophecies,

1253
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,510
this is kind of one of them and I,
you know, as far as I'm concerned,

1254
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:21,540
your personality in anyone's personality
is not set in stone by by any stretch.

1255
01:14:21,831 --> 01:14:26,831
And of course can you have some
natural tendencies as a person,

1256
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,340
of course you,

1257
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:35,380
you do have some natural tendencies and
if your brain was on autopilot you would

1258
01:14:35,991 --> 01:14:38,540
steer towards those
personality traits even more.

1259
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:43,541
But luckily our brain is not on autopilot
and you have your hands on the wheel

1260
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:50,570
had you can control your mind
and you can in this case,

1261
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,420
you know, step back and, and,

1262
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:55,760
and get a grip on things that you know,

1263
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:58,010
according to the question
that caused friction,

1264
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,640
right?
If

1265
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:07,200
as if as an I n g a t you are supposedly
too demanding and these are little

1266
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,160
quotes that they had.

1267
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:14,080
If you're too demanding or not open to
other people are not open to other ideas.

1268
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:18,500
Here's what you do. Real
simple. Get less demanding,

1269
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:20,683
right?

1270
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,840
If you have a hard time listening to
other people listened to other people,

1271
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,003
if you,

1272
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:32,750
and this was another quote I got
from the I n j t personality Matrix,

1273
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:37,010
if you are supposed to have a low
tolerance of emotion in others,

1274
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,230
then get more

1275
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:44,790
tolerance for emotions in others.
This isn't hard.

1276
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:48,720
You identified what the issues are.
You've heard me say this all the time,

1277
01:15:48,721 --> 01:15:51,090
listened to other people,
treat them with respect.

1278
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:56,100
These things are not doing
that, so do them. That's,

1279
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:58,470
that's really simple.

1280
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:02,220
There's no reason to you for you to
fulfill this prophecy of being a person

1281
01:16:02,221 --> 01:16:04,920
that's not open other's ideas.
A person that's not,

1282
01:16:04,921 --> 01:16:07,210
that has low tolerance for other people.
There's,

1283
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,630
there's no reason for you
to be overly demanding.

1284
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,680
You don't have to be this way just
because that's your personality type

1285
01:16:13,681 --> 01:16:16,650
allegedly. That doesn't mean you have to
be that way. He goes, it's kind of like,

1286
01:16:16,651 --> 01:16:21,120
um, you know, the, the,
the horoscope signs,

1287
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,780
right? Sure. And I do people
even talk about those anymore?

1288
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:29,070
I didn't know my dad well, what is
it? Horoscope or astrology? Astrology.

1289
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,330
Is that the same thing? Yeah. Yeah.
Well you read your horoscope, but the,

1290
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:38,520
the based on the magic
of astrology. Yeah. Uh,

1291
01:16:38,521 --> 01:16:43,500
yeah, people still do that.
So, so when I look, when I die,

1292
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,910
it hasn't happened to me in a while, but
when I was younger, um, people would say,

1293
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:51,960
you know, like, oh, what, what sign are
you? And I'd say, Ah, I'm, you know,

1294
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:54,720
I'm a Scorpio. And they say, Oh,

1295
01:16:54,721 --> 01:16:58,490
I could tell you are a Scorpio.
Yeah.

1296
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,530
I totally pegged you as a Scorpio.
I saw that. I go, actually,

1297
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:06,300
I'm not a scroll down.
And I'd say, you know,

1298
01:17:06,301 --> 01:17:10,580
actually I'm a Libra. And they'd
go, oh, go, no, no, have, yeah,

1299
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:13,790
for sure. You're a Libra
all the way. Definitely.

1300
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:17,180
Cause you have this and you're that. And
I go, actually, I'm kidding. I'm, I'm,

1301
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,530
I'm actually a Virgo.

1302
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:23,150
And then they wouldn't trust me anymore
and I was a bastard and whatever.

1303
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:27,650
But my point is,
according to some random Zodiac calendar,

1304
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,220
it's,
you can place those like

1305
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:32,000
okay

1306
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,030
overlays on anybody and you can
kind of make them fit. And I,

1307
01:17:35,031 --> 01:17:38,690
that's what I'm saying is like,
I'm not saying that the, that the

1308
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:42,960
ENTP or s j or element,
Opi or whatever,

1309
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:46,650
I'm not saying that the Myers Briggs
thing is just wrong. I think it's,

1310
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:48,120
I think it's good to have a framework.

1311
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:50,490
I think it's fine to have a
framework and say, Oh yeah,

1312
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,380
I recognize this trait in myself,
or yeah,

1313
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:55,890
I recognize that trading myself or I
recognize that trait in someone else and

1314
01:17:55,891 --> 01:17:59,430
then you can deal with it. I think
that's good. But what I don't,

1315
01:17:59,431 --> 01:18:04,431
what I don't accept is saying
this is what I am and therefore,

1316
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,830
um, I'm not going to change
no wrong answer. If we all
just accepted who we are,

1317
01:18:10,831 --> 01:18:13,380
you know, you're, you're not going
to make any progress, you know,

1318
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:17,970
so you find some weaknesses and your
personality and you fix them. That's,

1319
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:24,690
that's what I'm saying. Adapt yourself,
evolve. Get better, stop creating fiction,

1320
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:29,040
friction, stop creating division,
be humble, listen, take input,

1321
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,330
all those things.
And,

1322
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:35,250
and I'll tell you one last
thing is if you really are, uh,

1323
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:40,340
the,
the I n t j didn't,

1324
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:43,890
that means that you're smart.
It means you're thinking,
it means you're pragmatic.

1325
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:48,891
It means you're an analytical person and
you're supposed to be all those things.

1326
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:50,220
So if you are

1327
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:51,090
okay,

1328
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:54,420
then realize that in order to be
successful member of the team,

1329
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:57,320
you need to put all those little
characteristics into check. Yeah,

1330
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,233
okay.

1331
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:03,480
Pragmatically and make it happen.
It's funny,

1332
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:08,030
I was reading about that very
recently about I and j t and all that,

1333
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:11,720
the break, Scott introvert,
introvert, extrovert

1334
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:13,183
and

1335
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:19,770
yeah. So there's that framework
and, but as it turns out,

1336
01:19:19,771 --> 01:19:23,940
it's like a bell curve where most people
are somewhere in the middle and you

1337
01:19:23,941 --> 01:19:27,900
kind of bounce in the middle there.
So there's extreme introverts for sure.

1338
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:32,700
Extreme extroverts, but usually
it's you, you're in the middle,

1339
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:37,840
you know? Yeah. Cool. There's a framework.
Cool. Another thing with that is,

1340
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:41,610
is just like Gary said, the
self fulfilling thing. So, uh,

1341
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,030
and I always say this just to my friends,

1342
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:47,910
whatever the different
like feeling a certain way.

1343
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,750
I don't think you should have too much
guilt and feeling a certain way. Like,

1344
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:54,870
you know, sometimes there'll be like,
Dang, I've, I felt like, I dunno,

1345
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,310
I felt prejudice or something like that.
And just be,

1346
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:00,180
cause those feelings come
from a bunch of things that,

1347
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:01,470
that a lot of time you can't control,

1348
01:20:01,471 --> 01:20:06,360
but behavior is different so you can feel
one thing and behave if your behavior

1349
01:20:06,361 --> 01:20:08,850
is just based straight up on
your feelings since that's like,

1350
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,210
that's kind of whack, you know,
you gotta be smarter where okay,

1351
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,990
you have these natural feelings. Cool.
So you're an insurer, I whatever.

1352
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:16,651
And so yeah,

1353
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:20,130
you might tend to have certain types of
feelings or lack of tolerance for this

1354
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:24,300
or you're not tolerant for, you know,
this or that. So when you're like, Hey,

1355
01:20:24,301 --> 01:20:29,190
I'm this, therefore it gives me a pass
to behave this way. It's like, Dang,

1356
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:32,910
Bro, you can't do that man.
And if you're intuitive,

1357
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:37,620
but shouldn't you kind of know that?
I guess I would think.

1358
01:20:37,621 --> 01:20:39,750
I would hope so. But yeah, so again,

1359
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:44,430
there's a difference between like feelings
and behavior and usually out would be,

1360
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:47,970
you know how you say like, yeah, if you
want to tough, if you want to be tougher,

1361
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,130
be tougher. Yeah. A lot
of times I'd be like,

1362
01:20:50,131 --> 01:20:54,330
well there's more to it than that in there
is really, but in this case in a way,

1363
01:20:54,331 --> 01:20:56,910
bro, you can really look
at it literally like that.

1364
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:01,770
If you have a lack of tolerance
for emotional bro, just
tolerate it, probably you,

1365
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,260
you self.
I think people do self diagnosed and,

1366
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:08,460
and give themselves a pass
and I know we kind of have,

1367
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:13,490
I think we do it naturally too because
I know this can put it real ambiguously

1368
01:21:14,011 --> 01:21:15,670
cause I don't call anyone out,
but the,

1369
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:19,980
I know this family where the little
girls growing up, they were like,

1370
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:24,480
they kept telling her, hey you're
acting this way because you have a,

1371
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:27,630
I don't know, I forget what I think
aspergers or something. Something. Yeah,

1372
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:29,610
some he goes,
oh that's just your thing.

1373
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,550
And they didn't like cultivating anything.

1374
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:35,010
They were just like real dismissive
about it. That's it. And then now,

1375
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:37,800
every time she acted up, she wouldn't
like try to curb her behavior.

1376
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,070
She'll act up and be like,
that's just my, whatever,

1377
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,810
my Asperger's or whatever that she
liked, embraced it, still behaved,

1378
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,141
you know,

1379
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:49,170
in whatever way she felt like behaving
and then just kind of put it on the

1380
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:53,620
aspergers. Yeah, you can.
It's mind control. Yeah man.

1381
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:55,110
It's mind control.
You got,

1382
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:59,880
I mean obviously you get some people
that have some significant, you know,

1383
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:02,760
a mental problem. Okay, I understand.

1384
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:06,660
But like this person that's
writing a logical question,

1385
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,210
they got mine control. They
just need to say, you know what?

1386
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,060
I'm going to be more open
to other people's emotions.

1387
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:16,140
I'm going to listen to other people's
ideas. Ready to go do it now. Yeah. Oh,

1388
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:20,400
I'm rejecting echos. Echos,
idea at point blank range. Okay.

1389
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:24,390
That's a signal I need to not do that.
I'm open to your ideal. Let me hear it.

1390
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:28,470
It's that easy. That's just my I n t
j acting up and I got to, you know,

1391
01:22:28,471 --> 01:22:32,860
I gotta check that. Got a check. Yeah.
The feelings versus behavior thing. Um,

1392
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,353
I think is,

1393
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:37,380
well it's one of those things where
when you know the problem that's like,

1394
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,240
cause this person's obviously ahead
of the game because they know,

1395
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,900
they know this is what's
causing, okay, I can, you know,

1396
01:22:42,901 --> 01:22:46,920
I can identify when I feel that
stuff coming on. Very important.

1397
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,910
Like it's an ailment, you know,
it's not ailment. It's good still.

1398
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:56,410
All right,
next question.

1399
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,620
Next question.
Is this the last one going out with yeah.

1400
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,100
I think maybe make this the last one off.
Okay.

1401
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:11,080
Jocko. We all know bad things
happen to good people sometimes.

1402
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,760
How do you deal? How do you deal when
those things happen to people around you?

1403
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:17,523
Very true.

1404
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:22,150
That sometimes bad things,

1405
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:27,151
horrible things happen to good people and

1406
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,650
I don't,
I don't know why,

1407
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:35,443
but

1408
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:39,290
life isn't fair that that's,

1409
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:44,320
that's the reality and disease like
cancer in Ms and a horrible diseases and

1410
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:53,090
accidents and
these things.

1411
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:59,090
A good person in the wrong place

1412
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:05,620
in the wrong time can
end up just a victim of,

1413
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:08,210
of,
of feet

1414
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:13,160
and end of reality.

1415
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:20,340
And it can be horrible
and a heart wrenching.

1416
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,833
But

1417
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:31,060
when those bad things happening

1418
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,990
to people around you,
what are you going to do?

1419
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:43,450
How are you going to lead?

1420
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:48,550
Are you going to get angry?
Aren't you going to get frustrated?

1421
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:50,350
Are you going to lash out at people who,

1422
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:55,380
who are you going to lash out at anyways
or are you going to start going down

1423
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:58,510
the spiral of negativity

1424
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:05,390
or are you going to let this horrible
situation dictate the way you feel and the

1425
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:09,250
way you handle it?

1426
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:16,770
Are you going to fall over and fall down,

1427
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:18,750
fall apart

1428
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,790
or or are you going to lead,

1429
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:34,150
nor are you going to face this issue
with courage and with resolution?

1430
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,910
Okay.

1431
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:43,260
I say lead,
lead,

1432
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,620
step up to the challenge.

1433
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:49,860
Be the one that other people look to

1434
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:56,010
absorb.
That impact absorbed that negativity.

1435
01:25:56,160 --> 01:26:00,780
Draw fire, draw fire. That's,

1436
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:05,780
that's when a member of a platoon for
for tactical reasons steps into the open

1437
01:26:05,781 --> 01:26:07,460
to draw enemy fire.

1438
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:11,720
Maybe to give another part of his team
the chance to move or or distract the

1439
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:16,580
enemy, but that's what I say,
draw, fire, bring that pain to me.

1440
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,140
Yeah,

1441
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:23,060
I can handle it when, when,

1442
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:27,890
maybe others cannot.
And when,

1443
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,990
when bad things are happening,

1444
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:34,370
I am going to try and
be the one good thing.

1445
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:39,410
The thing standing tall
that can be relied upon.

1446
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:40,980
Okay.

1447
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:45,980
Because I know that that
attitude will spread.

1448
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:51,000
It will bolster those around me.

1449
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,760
Okay.

1450
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:55,490
And,
and we will fight.

1451
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:57,673
Okay.

1452
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:01,190
And in fighting we will win.

1453
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:04,203
Okay.

1454
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:07,380
And if not,
the battle and if not the war,

1455
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,430
we will win because our spirit,

1456
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,110
it will never surrender.

1457
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,093
Yeah.

1458
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:17,103
In that,

1459
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:24,180
that is the ultimate victory to hold your
head high and even even in the face of

1460
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,890
inescapable defeat

1461
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:37,970
to stand
and to fight.

1462
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:42,620
That
is to win.

1463
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:56,970
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1464
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:57,913
Okay.

1465
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,550
Echo. Yes. Let's close this
thing out a little bit.

1466
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:07,200
Before we do that though,

1467
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:12,300
let's talk about how the people
that are listening to this,

1468
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:14,190
if you want to listen to more of it,

1469
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:19,410
what's the best way to
support the podcast?

1470
01:28:19,411 --> 01:28:24,300
What's the best way to get in
the game here with the boys?

1471
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:27,690
Help that help us keep rolling this
thing out. What's the best way to go?

1472
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,940
What do we need to clarify or get in
the game means a lot. Yeah. Cause it's,

1473
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:38,070
you're getting in the game and flourishing
in the game really. And to do that,

1474
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:43,830
you may or may not need supplementation.
If you do you like that, like a little,

1475
01:28:43,831 --> 01:28:47,090
oh, you went there, what do you call
it? Like a transition anyway. Um,

1476
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:50,760
so supplementation, right? I
need more krill oil by the way.

1477
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:54,450
You should have told me that
before we met today. Yeah. Yeah.

1478
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:59,400
As opposed to right now. Nonetheless
on it, on it has best supplements.

1479
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:02,040
Everyone knows that. I,
I think everyone knows

1480
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,120
that by now.

1481
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:08,010
But if you want 10% off and
you're new to on it or are you in,

1482
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:10,260
if you have on it stuff and you'll just,
when you're getting more,

1483
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:13,560
you want 10% off,
go on it.com/jocko 10% off.

1484
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:17,280
If you really want to step
up your supplementation game.

1485
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:21,540
I think I mentioned this once before,
but nonetheless,

1486
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:27,150
it's called stay on it. It's so, you know
how I don't have krill oil right now.

1487
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:32,300
I didn't stay on it. Stay on it is boom,
you hit, it's like the monthly ones. Yeah,

1488
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:37,340
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And
in this case it's like, um,

1489
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,990
it's good because it is one of those
things that you need to come back every

1490
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:46,770
month. You need, you need cro. Yeah.
Every month. Every month. Yeah.

1491
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:51,180
And like warrior bars, you need varying
levels of warrior bars per month.

1492
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:54,550
Sometimes more, sometimes lessons.
This is true, but yeah. [inaudible]

1493
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:58,890
dot com slash Jocko 10% off. Boom.
Check out all their stuff. Very good.

1494
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:03,540
Also,
Amazon troop tool does not work anymore.

1495
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:08,010
The Trooper Casey didn't know Troy
by the empire. Yeah. Which, you know,

1496
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:11,130
it had a good run and you
know, cool. But nonetheless,

1497
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:14,910
we are still doing the Amazon thing
and people do support through Amazon,

1498
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:17,700
which is good. Very
good. It's awesome. Yeah.

1499
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:21,450
So what does it cost them to
support the podcast through Amazon?

1500
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:25,380
It costs three seconds of their time.
That's appreciated.

1501
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:29,640
And that's just a one time investment
potentially. If you, you know,

1502
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:31,860
you save it to them, you click
on the k, you go to the website,

1503
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:36,240
check out podcast.com or [inaudible] dot
com click on the Amazon link before he

1504
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:40,650
do shopping,
it'll take you to the m two Amazon.

1505
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:44,840
Save that save the resulting linked in
like a bookmarks is a favorite bookmark

1506
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:48,660
favorite so you can support every time
you shopped and it costs you nothing.

1507
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,990
That initial three seconds of your life.
You know,

1508
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:56,040
I lot of people been doing
that and that's, that's
solid right there. Thank you.

1509
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:57,780
Um, but yeah, do it that way.

1510
01:30:57,781 --> 01:31:02,781
You can support and also subscribe
on iTunes if you haven't already and

1511
01:31:04,231 --> 01:31:05,400
subscribe on Youtube.

1512
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,990
I know I've been saying this for year.

1513
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,570
You're actually um,
trust level and no man,

1514
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:18,070
you're starting to cost yourself there. I
think it's my fault. Actually Know Matt,

1515
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:20,510
you've been,
you've been giving me trust and brought,

1516
01:31:20,511 --> 01:31:24,240
I haven't been throwing it back
at me. I Dunno. Nonetheless,

1517
01:31:24,241 --> 01:31:27,750
I know I've been saying it
and where you're getting as
you're going to make more

1518
01:31:27,751 --> 01:31:32,670
videos now. Yeah. I'm going to tell you,

1519
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:34,650
just trust me on this.

1520
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:39,420
Everybody that listened to his podcast
wants you to make more videos. No.

1521
01:31:39,421 --> 01:31:42,360
Feel any pressure about that. Maybe that's
just not your, maybe you just don't,

1522
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:45,000
you know, you don't want to
make it happen. That's okay.

1523
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:48,960
We want you to know that we all,
all of us,

1524
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:54,030
we all want you to make
more videos. That's the vote
from US troopers over here.

1525
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:56,960
So you got your thing,
you know,

1526
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:01,970
hopefully find some time and
make some bad ass videos.

1527
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:06,950
I'll, um, I'll try. Thanks for
calling them bad ass the welding.

1528
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:10,630
That's my bro. That's
motivating. Thanks. Well,

1529
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:15,190

find some discipline to make some more

1530
01:32:15,191 --> 01:32:19,990
videos for, for us. Okay, I'll,
I'll do it. Um, but yes, tonight,

1533
01:32:28,331 --> 01:32:30,160
That's the most basic level of,

1534
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:35,730
of joining the movement
is that Tuesday night,

1535
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,310
maybe around 11 o'clock, depending on
where you are, depending on where you are.

1536
01:32:42,311 --> 01:32:45,970
Maybe it's two o'clock in the morning,
Wednesday night, had a little icon,

1537
01:32:45,971 --> 01:32:49,780
comes up with a little one
next to it that you got a new,

1538
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:54,700
a new podcast listen to,
which is, which is good to go.

1539
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,330
Yeah. That one is um,
what do you call that?

1540
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:02,260
It's like a Q or something in what they
expect is what's called the variable

1541
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:05,830
reward. Anyway, that's a whole
different thing. Nonetheless.

1542
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,280
He was brought up variable reward go.
What is this?

1543
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,640
Is this like the endorphins thing where
you see it and you get all excited? Yeah,

1544
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:14,800
it cut out. So variable
reward. It's like when you,

1545
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:20,070
it's like the really,
the iconic cases,

1546
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:24,120
any like Facebook or whatever you see
the one that, the alert, I don't know.

1547
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:28,390
I don't know what it is.
It could be someone talking good about me.

1548
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:32,350
It could be someone invited me to
play a game. It's a variable reward.

1549
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:35,680
Like it could be a fun thing with
a high payoff. Could be low payoff,

1550
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:38,570
but I know it's something, you
know, I don't know what it is. Like,

1551
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,630
well they decided they want
to click on it. In this case,

1552
01:33:40,631 --> 01:33:42,880
I'm going to go ahead and say I'm,

1553
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:47,800
I know it's going to be a
high value reward when I see
that little one and I go,

1554
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:51,340
yes, I get to listen to the podcasts.
And I know some people said it was weird.

1555
01:33:51,341 --> 01:33:52,270
I listened to podcast,

1556
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,660
I have to listen to podcasts so
I know what we talked about. B,

1557
01:33:55,661 --> 01:33:59,520
what we could do better. Yeah. See
where we need to get better. Yeah.

1558
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,640
All those things. So I got to listen to
it. Yeah. Sometimes even when people,

1559
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:08,080
you know, like a lot of times key,
the podcast comes out the next day.

1560
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:10,150
A lot of,
lot of fun.

1561
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:14,620
Twitter are bringing up stuff
that you said or whatever,

1562
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,490
and he'd be like, oh wait. Yeah, I
didn't know it came off like that.

1563
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:21,490
Whether it's true or not or whatever. It's
kind of like, so when you listen to it,

1564
01:34:21,491 --> 01:34:22,570
you're like way more in tune.

1565
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:27,280
Now this might be a backhanded
compliment or not, I'm not sure.

1566
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:32,890
But when you say something
cool on the podcast,

1567
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,720
everybody loves it.
Everyone goes nuts. Yeah.

1568
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:39,970
And I'm not trying to say that you
don't say cool things often cause I,

1569
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:41,770
I think you say a lot of cool things,

1570
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:44,890
but the ones that people
capture and they go, yeah,

1571
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,660
Echo said this and they do like,

1572
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:50,470
and they just flood the Inter webs
with Echo Charles, his greatness.

1573
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:54,220
You know what that's like?
It's like one,

1574
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:58,280
a two year old says like a word or like
a one and a half year old says a word.

1575
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,320
Oh my gosh.
They said I love you.

1576
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:08,310
Everyone says I love you. It's just the
fact there's not much for your recording.

1577
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:12,680
You said something like pretty
legit before we recorded
today. What did you say?

1578
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:16,790
I don't know. Yeah, you do know
what you said. Say it again.

1579
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:19,490
You get all the people excited anyway.

1580
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:25,220
It might've been something about the Junco
store. It was a gem. I don't remember.

1581
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:30,470
Okay. Always record. Always
record tenacious d fans out there.

1582
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:34,370
You know exactly what I'm talking
about. Alright. Nonetheless,

1583
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:36,650
Jacqueline Stone,
we could talk about that.

1584
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:39,320
That's a good way to get
in the game for sure.

1585
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:44,810
That's where all the shirts and stuff are.
That wasn't really built up.

1586
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:49,460
I'm sitting here and here's the thing
about the shirts. What's on the shirt?

1587
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:53,390
There's a, there's a hidden or not.
So he didn't meaning. So you know,

1588
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,550
a lot of times, you know, you
know what the meaning, you know,

1589
01:35:55,551 --> 01:35:58,160
if you listened to this and you're kind
of in the game, you know the meaning,

1590
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:01,490
you know, but it's not just a shirt with
the design, there's meaning behind it.

1591
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:05,140
So that's so, so, so,

1592
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:09,070
so if you listen and you know,
right.

1593
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:13,280
And if you don't listen to it, it
makes no sense. It makes less sense.

1594
01:36:13,281 --> 01:36:16,930
Put it that way. But yeah, exactly
right. There could be some,

1595
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:21,270
there could be some shirts that make
no sense to anybody. And that's,

1596
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,753
did you see,

1597
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:28,050
I put out the old band when I was
a kid and I tweeted this picture,

1598
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:32,570
the tee shirt that we had made.

1599
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:36,590
My buddy had the silk screen still,
so I held it up to the light.

1600
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:38,210
I took a picture,
I posted it.

1601
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:43,430
The name of the band was Bronson's
children as in Charles Bronson,

1602
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:45,860
who when I was a kid,
Charles Bronson,

1603
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:49,250
I thought that he was the man and I
thought it was a man cause you had awesome

1604
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:52,900
movies but that I didn't care about
that. He was a war hero. He was a,

1605
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:56,090
he was in the World War II.
You Purple Heart.

1606
01:36:56,180 --> 01:37:00,410
He was a tail gunner just to
just a bad ass guy. And so we,

1607
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:03,800
me and my buddies, we thought Charles
Bronson was the man. So we had our van,

1608
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:05,510
we called it Bronson's children.

1609
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:11,210
So we run that shirt blue. That might
be something people are going to like,

1610
01:37:11,211 --> 01:37:13,400
but who's going to look at that and know,

1611
01:37:13,401 --> 01:37:15,110
have any idea what
they're going to be like,

1612
01:37:15,111 --> 01:37:16,860
hey that kind of looks
like Charles Ronson.

1613
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,920
Cause it doesn't even kind of
look like John. It's straight up.

1614
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:22,610
Looks like dropping off. Well
yeah they won't. No, no, no.

1615
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,600
The Dia State of Charles Bronson.
I Dunno. His likeness. Yeah,

1616
01:37:26,601 --> 01:37:30,520
we'd be definitely using
this likeness. Yeah. Yeah.

1617
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:35,120
But actually Jill Ireland, she, she died
as well. I don't know who's, I dunno.

1618
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:39,500
I Dunno who's left the Bronson family.
I don't know. Maybe we could Debbie.

1619
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:41,060
Good way to get in contact with them,

1620
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:44,790
start producing their
shirts and get sued bio that

1621
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:51,700
Bronson's children would get sued,
you know, cause you're Brunson stilts

1622
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,750
variable reward there. Yup. Okay.

1623
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:02,760
I think the shirts are cool. Currently the
bronze and children one that's, that's,

1624
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:07,350
that's a deep one. Two that's good. Um,
but the end, they have layers like I said.

1625
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:11,260
And I'm saying that's a good way to
support. If you don't like shirts,

1626
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:16,170
don't get the shirts. I would say go,
go that, go Jocko store.com. Go there,

1627
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:19,620
look at the shirts. You don't like them,
don't get nothing. Would just look,

1628
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:23,870
could you get a rash card there if you're
so inclined to get a rash guard and

1629
01:38:23,871 --> 01:38:26,040
you can get her escort for sure.
The rash guards are good.

1630
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:29,310
I think that's almost like on a
factual level where they're good.

1631
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:31,630
Well there's a lot of people that are,
are,

1632
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:36,820
have experienced the 19% increase in their
jujitsu skills or strength levels and

1633
01:38:36,821 --> 01:38:40,030
running. So I had,

1634
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,970
so now all my training partners,

1635
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:47,140
or at least a lot of them are wearing
trooper rash guards when they fight me.

1636
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:50,230
So I'm having to fight these guys that
are coming at me and they all look the

1637
01:38:50,231 --> 01:38:50,561
same.

1638
01:38:50,561 --> 01:38:54,010
They're all monster guys with trooper
tee shirt or a trooper rash guards on it

1639
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,080
is not fun.
I'm getting beat up by my own people.

1640
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:59,460
19% more than you were at 90% more

1641
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:05,160
seraph man. It's rough being
Jocko sometimes the um, but yeah,

1642
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:06,400
the rest goes good.
I had a good car,

1643
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:11,430
like kind of email conversation and it's
telling me how wakes up in the morning

1644
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:16,260
does a run, this is in, oh, I'm
totally forgetting where it was,

1645
01:39:16,261 --> 01:39:21,150
but just kind of the serenity,
contrast it with the trooper rash guard.

1646
01:39:21,151 --> 01:39:24,860
It was, it was nice
nonetheless. You know, uh, the,

1647
01:39:24,861 --> 01:39:29,010
the rash guards are good
if you're into it. Jujitsu,
surfing, running and crossfit.

1648
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:31,510
And I know you thought of this and I
know we thought of this, but you know,

1649
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:35,170
I talked Tobar Right now. Yeah, 2016

1650
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:39,460
and we need,
we need hoodies.

1651
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:44,680

1653
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:53,730
people are going to need true blue
hoodies for Halloween. Just Fyi.

1654
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:58,340
I myself included, we are
going to need them. Yeah.

1655
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:00,880
So yeah, hoodies coming out. Um,

1656
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:06,730
we went, I did like an, it wasn't
a poll. What he do, you know,

1657
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,720
you can do a poll on Twitter.
I said pull over or zip up.

1658
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:15,250
Pull over one. Yeah, for
sure. I strangely, I like me.

1659
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:19,080
Well that's jacked up.
Actually,

1660
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:22,750
I asked you a long time ago when it was
just like a theory and an idea and you

1661
01:40:22,751 --> 01:40:26,740
were like, pull over. I didn't agree,
but I didn't agree. I was like pull over.

1662
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,190
You don't know there's a
buck. I'm, but yeah, I,

1663
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:35,410
I think they're both cool for sure. But
um, pullover won by a landslide to, yeah,

1664
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:40,180
it's crazy. No doubt. Um,
nonetheless hope. Yeah, pull
over there you go on the way.

1665
01:40:40,181 --> 01:40:44,710
Two weeks, they should be solid.
Um, and then, you know, other stuff,

1666
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:49,060
some girls, tanks, tee shirts
coming out, um, girls tee shirt,

1667
01:40:49,061 --> 01:40:52,150
girl's tee shirts.
You're getting abused by the girls.

1668
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:54,100
I will say persuaded.

1669
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,500
I see them rough.

1670
01:40:56,660 --> 01:41:01,420
You up persuaded they chose not to
flank but persuaded nonetheless.

1671
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:05,030
They're all about the direct
action for sure. Well,

1672
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:09,500
I'm still some women's stuff on there
and more in in some patches. Um,

1673
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:12,910
again,
with the size of the velcro patches,

1674
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:17,530
the two by three is on the way right
now they're four by four across three

1675
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:22,180
inches down. That's big for the
standard Velcro interchangeable.
Right, right. Yeah.

1676
01:41:22,181 --> 01:41:26,200
So just know that they're on their
way. Yeah, good. I mean it's, you know,

1677
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,850
four with three is fine I guess,

1678
01:41:27,851 --> 01:41:31,710
but not free if you're interchangeable
and you got the two by three for all the

1679
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:35,560
military guys and law
enforcement they need,

1680
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:37,330
they need three by two and this is,

1681
01:41:37,331 --> 01:41:41,830
I should have told you that and made it
a little more clear. Yeah. But anyways,

1682
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:45,340
nonetheless. Yeah. So the
main thing go there, Jocko.

1683
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:50,020
store.com is just the store with
everything. Again, if you don't like it,

1684
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:54,490
don't get it. But look, you might like
that one and bumper stickers anyway.

1685
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:57,370
Also on Amazon,

1686
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:03,340
you can go and get yourself some
Jocko white day. Yeah. And it's sell.

1687
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:08,290
It sold a lot better. It's
sold, it's selling amazing.

1688
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:13,860
And we got a massive order on the way
and we've also got some restock coming.

1689
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:19,440
So it came originally in these really
nice tins that costs a lot of money to

1690
01:42:20,261 --> 01:42:22,510
make.
And so that's cool.

1691
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:25,750
You want to have one of those tens
but if you're doing your reload,

1692
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:29,290
you're going to be able to buy in the
next few weeks you'll be able to buy a

1693
01:42:29,291 --> 01:42:31,630
reload a box with a hundred in it,

1694
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:35,650
a hundred so you don't need like another
two and another 10 you can use the same

1695
01:42:35,651 --> 01:42:39,130
Tim refill it. So that's
common. And you know what?

1696
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:43,870
If you're uncertain of whether
or not you need the white tea,

1697
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:48,040
it's real easy. Go to Amazon, you
go to Amazon, you read the reviews,

1698
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:51,900
you will be convinced
because they are perfectly,

1699
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:55,990
the Jocko white tea is performing
miracles. Evidently yes,

1700
01:42:56,650 --> 01:43:01,000
across the board. So those were awesome.
Go read. Those are funny as hell. So,

1701
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:04,000
and let's see.
Also,

1702
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:07,960
if you haven't gotten extreme ownership
book by myself and my brother Lafe Babin,

1703
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:11,380
just go ahead and grab that
book and own that book.

1704
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:15,550
Take extreme ownership of
the book, extreme ownership
and you'll be good to go.

1705
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,190
And,
and also if you have it,

1706
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:22,480
but there's other people that need it.

1707
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:26,500
Sometimes you need to take ownership of
that situation as well and you just need

1708
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:27,520
to buy them a copy.

1709
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:32,050
And also extreme ownership.

1710
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:36,820
The muster in San Diego,
California, October 20th and 21st

1711
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:41,920
it's a leadership conference or are we
talking about combat leadership and the

1712
01:43:41,921 --> 01:43:46,921
application of those principles from
combat and how you use them on the

1713
01:43:47,351 --> 01:43:51,500
battlefield, how you use them in
business and how you use them in life.

1714
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:56,510
So register, come on out. We'll
see. Then it's getting close.

1715
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:59,450
Obviously Labor's going to be there.
Andrew Paul,

1716
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:04,100
who was on the podcast going to be their
echo. Charles will be in the house.

1717
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:09,530
So come on out and let's,
let's crush that as always,

1718
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:13,610
if you do want to keep it real,
real,

1719
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:17,360
real with echo and with myself,

1720
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:22,390
we kind of rolled deep on the interwebs
and we're there on Twitter for me,

1721
01:44:25,491 --> 01:44:29,120
primarily Twitter,
also Instagram,

1722
01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:33,980
also that face book,
he is there and we're both on.

1723
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:38,390
Echo is at echocharles
and I am at Jocko Willink.

1724
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:42,740
And last but not least,

1725
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:48,090
thank you
out there.

1726
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:53,210
You listening engaging troops overseas
and that are deploying overseas to hunt

1727
01:44:57,841 --> 01:44:59,820
down evil.
Thank you.

1728
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:06,880
Police and law enforcement with an
incredibly hard job risking your lives to

1729
01:45:08,151 --> 01:45:12,500
keep us safe.
Thank you

1730
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:16,720
firefighters.
Of course,

1731
01:45:16,721 --> 01:45:19,450
that literally run toward fire.

1732
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:23,080
Thank you.

1733
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:27,910
And to the working men and women building,

1734
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:32,080
creating, fixing, buying, selling,

1735
01:45:32,081 --> 01:45:36,070
designing,
making this world

1736
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:42,190
thanks to each of you
for what you are doing,

1737
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,880
for doing your bit the best you can.

1738
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:54,390
And finally,
thank you all

1739
01:45:56,110 --> 01:45:56,943
okay

1740
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:01,360
for getting after it.
So until next time,

1741
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,270
this is echo and Jocko.
