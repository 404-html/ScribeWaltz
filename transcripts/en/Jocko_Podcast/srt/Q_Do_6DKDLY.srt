1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,790
Going to your book a little bit. I'm
gonna, I'm going to, um, pick up.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,520
Going back to that first thought.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,690
Standing up means voluntarily excepting
the burden of being your nervous system

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:14,830
responds in an entirely different manner.

5
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:18,310
When you face the demands
of life voluntarily,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,030
you respond to a challenge.
Instead of bracing for a catastrophe,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,230
you see the gold,

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,880
the dragon hoards instead of shrinking
and terror from the all too real fact of

9
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,714
the dragon,

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,960
you step forward to take your place in
the dominance hierarchy and occupy your

11
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:39,370
territory. Manifesting your willingness
to defend, expand, and transform it.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,110
To stand up straight with your
shoulders back is to accept the terrible

13
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:48,010
responsibility of life
with eyes wide open. Great.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,120
The reason I pulled that
one out in particular is the
feeling that you have as a

15
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:56,290
soldier or as a,
as a military person,

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,550
a feeling that you have going on and
off offensive operation where let's say

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,310
you're a bad guy and I'm gonna come and
get you at night. Well, first of all,

18
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:08,020
you don't know and I'm sneaking up on
you and I have all this power, right?

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,190
I feel good about it,

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,660
I'm going to get you the opposite of
that is when I'm doing a convoy or I'm

21
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:15,670
going on a patrol where now
the bad guys are out there,

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,030
they're waiting to attack me.
And that is a defensive posture.

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,330
And your attitude about
that type of thing is bad.

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,230
Now we would train our guys that we,

25
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,840
we made a specific point with
my guys. I would say, look,

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,620
when you're on patrol, we're on
the offense, we are scanning,

27
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:34,330
we are looking to get the,

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,360
to get us to be standing up straight and
to get the mentality of we want to do

29
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:43,480
this and we're moving towards the
target as opposed to we're being chased.

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,243
That's a big deal.

31
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,510
Absolutely. That's a big deal. Yeah. And,
and that's, that's, what would you say?

32
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,760
That's an extreme example of what's
necessary under normal conditions in life.

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,420
So one of the things that happens if
you're treating someone who has a phobia,

34
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:03,040
say like agoraphobic. So they become
afraid of virtually everything. Um,

35
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,620
maybe they're afraid of an elevator.
It's one of many fears.

36
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:07,760
And so you think well,

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,540
and they're afraid of an elevator because
they've actually gone in elevators and

38
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,361
have panic attack.

39
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:16,200
So it's weird because what you do to cure
them is to get them to go in elevators

40
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,710
and you think, well wait a second.
That's actually what caused the problem.

41
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,160
So how can getting them to do that again,
make it better.

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,370
And the answer is because they've gone
in elevators their whole life, right?

43
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,050
And yet they still become terrified.

44
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,010
So how can getting them to go in an
elevator cure them for a long time?

45
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,700
People thought, well you get them to
relax while they were in the elevator.

46
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,630
And the pairing of the relaxation with
being in the elevator taught them to not

47
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:41,240
be afraid. That was the first
theory. But then people learned,

48
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,880
didn't know you could just get them to
go in the elevator without having them

49
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,140
relax.
And it also worked.

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,560
And eventually psychologists sorted this
out and what they figured out was that

51
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,410
voluntarily encountering something
you're afraid of is not the same thing as

52
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:59,090
running from it. Like it's seriously not
the same thing. So you say to the person,

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,980
you're afraid of the elevator,
let's can you go look at an elevator?

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,670
And they usually say yes and maybe they're
so terrified because they're so far

55
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,290
gone in their illness that they can't say,

56
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,080
well how about we look at a bunch of
pictures of elevators since like virtually

57
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:11,980
everyone can do that.

58
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,040
So let's say let's look at pictures
of elevators till your board.

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,040
That actually doesn't take very long
because it's actually quite boring.

60
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,170
So then the next thing would be,
well let's go.

61
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,200
You have to have the person trust
you. And so the rule is, look,

62
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,550
we're going to do some things that are
going to push you like competition,

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,000
but you can stop whenever you want and
we're not going to push you any farther

64
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,030
than is good for you and
all stop anytime you want.

65
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,650
I often practice with my clients,

66
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:39,040
like I taught one client a while back
to not be afraid of needles and he was

67
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,800
afraid of needles.
And I'll tell you what that meant.

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,150
He had dental surgery with no anesthesia.
Oh right,

69
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,870
okay. So that gives you some level
of what it's like to be afraid.

70
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,810
It's like all do the dental surgery, but
you're not putting that needle in there.

71
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,350
It's really,
it's like I'm no needles so,

72
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,340
so I taught them how to not be afraid
of, of needles, you know, and it,

73
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,610
it didn't take very long.
But the first thing I did,

74
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,750
I told him I was going to bring a
needle into the office. That was all,

75
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,170
I told him the first week is next week
I'm going to bring a needle in here and

76
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:14,620
I'm going to keep it sheets and it's
going to be sitting on a shelf and that's

77
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,450
where I'm going to put it.
And when you come in here,

78
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:19,960
you can look at it and if you want me
to put it away then I'll put it away.

79
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:23,350
It's under your control.
And then so he was okay with that.

80
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,810
So he came in and said
there's the needless, do you
want to look at it and said,

81
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,870
no, but Kenyon, it's like all look at it.
So he looked at it and then they said,

82
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:32,890
look like I'm going to pick up the needle
and now what you're gonna do is you're

83
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,680
going to tell me to put it down
and I'm going to put it down.

84
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,360
So I picked it up and he got nervous,
like right away, and he said, well,

85
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,130
you put that down. I put
it down right away. I said,

86
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:47,131
we do that 10 times so that the bottom
part of your nervous system actually

87
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,880
knows that that's what's going to happen.
Said now,

88
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,670
and then the next thing we'll do is
we're going to practice you saying you've

89
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:59,050
had enough and leaving the office. So
I'd pick up the needle and then he'd say,

90
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:01,390
okay, so now you say you've
had enough, I'm leaving.

91
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,640
And so he said that and
then I'd let him leave.

92
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:07,450
We did that like 10 times so that he knew
that he could just say he'd had enough

93
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,730
and leave. So that mean he didn't
have to be a prey animal. Right.

94
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,350
So we're getting them out of that mode
and it didn't take very long until,

95
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,590
well then I could bring the
needle close to him and I said,

96
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:21,220
make sure you watch it. You can't
pretend it's not there. Right.

97
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,460
I'll bring it close to him and touch
and touch them with the sheath needle.

98
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,450
So we did that a bunch and then finally
I unsheathed it and I'd bring it close

99
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:32,020
and he tolerate that or stop me
and then I'd touch them with that.

100
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,350
And then the last part of it was that,
um,

101
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,920
I put it under a piece of paper so he
couldn't see it and then I'd bring it

102
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,370
close to him. Right. Cause that
was, that was the unknown. Right.

103
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,770
You don't know what the hell is going
on underneath the piece of paper,

104
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,130
but he got to the point where he could
go and have a needle. It took them about,

105
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,240
it was very brave of him to do this
because, well, what had happened, he got,

106
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,300
what had happened to him is he had a
very bad experience with the childhood

107
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:59,870
dentist, held him down,
held him six people,

108
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:04,070
held them down to give him a needle.
It's like wasn't so good.

109
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,580
It had some long term consequences.
But see what happens. So when you,

110
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,390
when you do that with people,
you don't teach them to be less afraid.

111
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,200
You teach them to be braver.
That's different.

112
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,560
And so like I had a client once the
doors open on the elevator and she looked

113
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,650
and she said, that's death. Like
that's a tube. And I thought, wow,

114
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,650
that's an amazing response.
And her idea was she'd go in there,

115
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,410
her heart rate would accelerate,
she'd have a heart attack and she die.

116
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,800
So as far as she was concerned, walking
in, there was death. Right. Okay.

117
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:34,400
So for me it was an elevator, but for
her it was death. It's like, okay,

118
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:38,240
well what do you do about
your fear of death? Well,
we're not getting rid of that.

119
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:42,920
It's like, you know, and you could die
in the elevator. You actually could,

120
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,970
probably, you won't. But people do die in
elevators. And her idea was that, well,

121
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:50,180
if anyone has ever died in an
elevator in the history of mankind,

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,780
that's a good reason for me not to be
in the elevator. It's like, fair enough.

123
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,050
You know? And why aren't you terrified
out of your skull all the time?

124
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,350
Because while you're wondering around,
you might have a heart attack like that,

125
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,110
we'll probably in fact
happened to you at some point.

126
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,740
So why aren't you terrified of that at
every moment? Well, that's the mystery.

127
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,180
While,
so you treat people and,

128
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,020
and you see with that client
what I eventually did with hers,

129
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:17,000
we went and watched an embalming. She
was terrified of death. Like, seriously?

130
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. No
kidding. But you know, so you get,

131
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,640
you don't get less afraid.
You get braver.

132
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,850
That's better because there's
plenty of things to be afraid of.
