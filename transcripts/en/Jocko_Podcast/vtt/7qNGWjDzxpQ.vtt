00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.990
Do I ever feel like Sisyphus?

2
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.450
Yeah,
of course do.

3
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.240
I've been waiting for people to start saying like,
oh,

4
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:21.440
you put another picture of the sweat and have a squat rack.
Really,

5
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.573
<v 1>but</v>

6
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.930
<v 0>I don't know if they understand.</v>

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.330
I've been getting on that squat rack,

8
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.150
grinding it out for 25 years,

9
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.110
and I'm not bored with it yet.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.650
It might seem like that's an unwinnable battle,

11
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.410
but really to me,
it's not about winning.

12
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.570
It's the battle itself.
It's the struggle.

13
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.840
It's the daily test.
That's what life's about.

14
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.910
Not just physically,

15
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.070
but mentally getting that rock to the top of the mountain.

16
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.090
That's not what my goal is.

17
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.620
My goal actually is she'd go rock

18
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.200
because pushy.
