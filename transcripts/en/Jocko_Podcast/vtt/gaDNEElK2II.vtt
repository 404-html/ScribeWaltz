This is Jocko podcast number one 72 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.340
Jocko Willink.
Good evening.
Good evening.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.840
The president of the United States takes pride in presenting the distinguished

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.320
service cross posthumously to Fred Garland,

5
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.350
Bragg junior first lieutenant us army for extraordinary heroism,

6
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.180
inaction and connection with military operations involving conflict with an

7
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.210
armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam while serving with Battery Bravo

8
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.020
Fourth Battalion 42nd Artillery.
Fourth Infantry Division.

9
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.780
First Lieutenant Brag,

10
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:49.781
distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 12 July,

11
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.010
1967 while serving as artillery forward observer with an infantry company while

12
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:59.810
on a search and destroy mission near the Cambodian border in central highlands.

13
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

14
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.450
<v 1>When his company was surrounded and the company commander was killed,</v>

15
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.010
Lieutenant Brag immediately took command and directed extremely deadly artillery

16
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:11.230
fire on the insurgent forces.

17
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.390
He bravely moved among his men giving encouragement and regrouping them into a

18
00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:17.650
more secure defense.

19
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.150
Although he was fully exposed to intense mortar and automatic weapons fire.

20
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.240
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

21
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.410
<v 1>seriously wounded.</v>

22
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.400
He continued to direct air strikes on the advancing enemy until a mortar round

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040
destroyed his only remaining radio staying in the open.

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.850
He poured round after round of deadly fire into the advancing enemy force.

25
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.540
<v 0>Okay?</v>

26
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.540
<v 1>He gave his life while bravely leading his men in the face of overwhelming odds.</v>

27
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.870
<v 0>Okay?</v>

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.040
<v 1>First Lieutenant Brags,</v>

29
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:56.041
extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty at the cost of his life were in

30
00:01:56.411 --> 00:02:00.940
keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great

31
00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:04.960
credit upon himself,
his unit and United States Army

32
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.440
Headquarters,
U s Army,
Vietnam,

33
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.280
September 14th,
1967

34
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.810
so there is some leadership,

35
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.743
<v 0>okay.</v>

36
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.200
<v 1>And obviously some heroism,
a lot of heroism.</v>

37
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.300
But that leadership taking command,
directing fire,

38
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.360
regrouping is men returning fire into it and advancing enemy force directing his

39
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:43.950
men despite overwhelming odds.
That is leadership.

40
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.920
That is leadership from one officer in the United States army.

41
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:56.971
But obviously there are countless examples of that leadership,

42
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.700
leadership,
and leadership.
And it's so

43
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.970
<v 0>okay,</v>

44
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.840
<v 1>clear.
And it's so obvious when you see it,</v>

45
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.100
especially from the outside.
But

46
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.650
it is hard

47
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.180
to actually emulate that leadership and to perform it,

48
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.150
especially when you're caught up in that moment.

49
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And so we have to continue to work on it at all times and at every level.

50
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.190
And today we're going to talk about a book.

51
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.780
It's a field manual actually that I think can help us a lot with our leadership,

52
00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:41.360
and it's an older manual,
which comes as no surprise.

53
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.330
This one comes from 1951

54
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.210
but I think you're going to see that the lessons apply just as much today as

55
00:03:50.211 --> 00:03:53.300
they did more than half a century ago.

56
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.730
The book is FM 22 tack 10 leadership.

57
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.610
And here we go.
Let's go to the book

58
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.030
talking about the purpose of the study of leadership.
Today,

59
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.530
more than ever in history,

60
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.910
the army is in need of leadership of the highest caliber with the increase in

61
00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:16.290
the complexity of warfare.
The science of wars,

62
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.560
increasingly dependent upon human guidance.

63
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.720
No matter how complicated it may become,

64
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.810
war is always waged by men.

65
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.140
<v 0>Okay?</v>

66
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.850
<v 1>The man who leads and the men who are led win wars,</v>

67
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.720
every member of our military force must be a leader actually,

68
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.040
or potentially,

69
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.803
<v 0>okay.</v>

70
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.210
<v 1>Now you could say those same words right now about what's happening right now,</v>

71
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.930
and sometimes people want to ask me,
well,

72
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:50.400
what about when the drones are ready?
You know what I mean?
Yes.
And,
and you know,

73
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:52.320
when you see the progress that's happening right now,

74
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.730
when you see some of those robot things that are,

75
00:04:55.731 --> 00:05:00.030
are doing pretty good and we start mountain some weapons on those things.
Yeah.

76
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:02.850
There's gonna be a point where those things will start fighting each other and

77
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:07.020
they'll replace humans on the battlefield to a certain extent.

78
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.730
Because the bottom line is what happens when you run out of robots.
Yeah.
Right.

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.480
When you run out of robots who's left humans and you're not gonna be able to

80
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.990
manufacture enough of those things,
so sure that,

81
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.030
I'm sure there'll be battles that take place with just robots fighting other

82
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.070
military robots or our robots fighting other fighting humans or something.

83
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:32.550
But sometimes it's going to humans against robots and sometimes it's going to be

84
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.220
humans against humans.
You're never gonna be able to get away from that.

85
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.610
In my opinion.
I don't,
I'm not happy about that.

86
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.140
I'm not happy about that at all.
Like I'm,
I'm down.

87
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.930
If you want to have robot wars,
cool.
Bring it.
You know,

88
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.270
I would rather that's better.
That's better for us.

89
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:51.210
We have good technology will go toe to toe.
Yeah.

90
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.500
And we'll create some,
some killer robots.

91
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.830
And I know people scared of them.

92
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.380
<v 2>Right.
Every time a robot does something cool,</v>

93
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:05.300
I get 5 million tweets of it that are telling me,
hey,
watch out.

94
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.440
And then they show the one's slipping on a banana peel falling down.
Right.

95
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.190
And even worse,
since I was in the seal teams,

96
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.810
put any of those spray of squirt gun at those things.
You know what I mean?

97
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.520
That things are going to fry.
So bring it on robots.

98
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.270
But no I'm not.
I'm not anti robot.
And I think you,
you know,

99
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:30.160
you just have to put a system in there that can stop them.
You know,

100
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.130
you have to be poor little kill switch on them like you have on a,
on a jet ski,

101
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.470
terminator,
Terminator,
salvation.
That was the whole deal.
Kill switch,

102
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.200
a little program or whatever.
Did they try to eliminate it?
Because you know,

103
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:49.340
if I had a kill switch I'd figure it out.
Yeah.
Could a robot do that?

104
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.080
Yeah.
I wonder,
I mean,
you know,
robots and Ai,
right?
They,

105
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.720
they go for like a trial and error kind of learning kind of where,
I mean,

106
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.460
they can do that like people can.
So if you,

107
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:06.260
maybe if the humans implemented it and it didn't hundred percent succeed,

108
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.780
then the robot would be like,
okay,
this is what happened.

109
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.080
Then analyze it and then yeah.
Then creates it defense.

110
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.450
My point is,
my point is,
hey,
seriously,
like I know that,

111
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.160
I mean look at drones.
Yeah.
Fully.

112
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:20.990
We're not going to have fighter pilots have much longer.

113
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.980
Like Dave Burke out of a job.
Good deal.
Yeah.
Get out of a job.

114
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.080
We're not going to need Dave Burke anymore.
Dang Bro.
Hey,
why would you,

115
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.243
you could have,

116
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.310
and I've had the little bit of this conversation with Dave and he's,

117
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:38.920
you know,
he's trying to,
he's trying to hang on to it.
Brock,

118
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.520
he's trying to hang on to the glory days.

119
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:44.360
He still thinks he's Tom Cruise 1987 but here's the real deal.

120
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.580
If you look at it pragmatically in another generation,

121
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.400
there won't be any more pilots,
in my opinion.

122
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.630
And I think that's what Dave said too,
is like we're a,

123
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.140
I think he said a couple of generations.
I was,
as I said,
hey man,

124
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:01.760
this isn't going to take a couple of generations.

125
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:04.280
We already have drones that are flying around.

126
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.610
So people are always going to have to fight.
I hate to say it,

127
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.810
but you have to be prepared.
And even if you build a robot army,

128
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.140
there's a chance that the robot army gets overrun or uh,

129
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.060
or destroyed somehow and then guess who's left you with a,

130
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:25.250
with a weapon.
So

131
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.820
with a weapon and with groups of human beings that need to be led

132
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.880
back to the book in the ultimate sense sense,
leadership is not inherent.

133
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.640
It depends upon traits which can be developed and upon the application of

134
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:46.040
techniques which can be learned.
This is important.

135
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.510
People always asking all the time is leadership,

136
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:53.060
are you born or made?
And I always say yes,
both.

137
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.010
And you have some natural skills and they say the same thing here,
but there are

138
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.580
<v 1>plenty of skills and techniques that you can learn as a leader that will make</v>

139
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.970
you a better leader.
Back to the book,
it is an art which can be acquired,

140
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:03.571
cultivated,

141
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.020
and practiced by anyone who possesses the mental and physical ability and the

142
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.060
moral and ethical integrity expected of a commissioned or noncommissioned

143
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.200
officer.
Developing the art,

144
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.460
which I agree with it is an art is a continuing process which involves the

145
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.760
recognition in practice of the basic traits of leadership and the understanding

146
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:28.590
and application of sound leadership,
principles and techniques.
Okay,
clear enough.

147
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:34.050
We can become better leaders.
Despite this guide.

148
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.450
It constantly must be borne in mind that successful leaders of the past,

149
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:41.520
we're not all have the same pattern,

150
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.960
nor did they all use the same methods of attaining success.
All of them,

151
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.823
however,

152
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:52.010
consciously or unconsciously understood the basic concepts of leadership and

153
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:55.770
successfully practiced.
Many of the techniques presented in this manual

154
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.363
<v 0>boom.</v>

155
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.240
<v 1>And this,
to be honest with you,
is Oh,
one of the most simple,</v>

156
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.200
straightforward,

157
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.170
<v 0>yeah.</v>

158
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.220
<v 1>Kind of guides to leadership,
which,
which makes it awesome.</v>

159
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.300
Starting off with characteristics of leadership.

160
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.450
Essential nature of leadership in the military profession has no monopoly on

161
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.630
leadership in every walk of life,
in every industry,

162
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.390
in every government,

163
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:29.100
in every phase of human endeavor,
there are leaders and there are followers.

164
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.730
Progress and success are dependent upon the quality and efficacy of leadership.

165
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.620
Elements of leadership.
Leadership is the art of influencing human behavior,

166
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.570
the ability to handle men,
the art of influencing behavior.

167
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.770
The very essence of leadership in turn involves understanding,
analyzing,

168
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:51.420
predicting,
and controlling man's behavior.

169
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.690
Also involved in successful leadership is the will to lead together with the

170
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:00.810
character,
which inspires confidence.
So you know,

171
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:03.530
we're getting it when you're starting to about character,

172
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.080
like these things are things that in the will to lead,

173
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.230
like you're going to be born with some level of those things.

174
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.510
I guess maybe character,
obviously you can develop that,

175
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:17.100
but certain people are born with a stronger will and I'm sure you see it with

176
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:21.510
your kids.
I see with my kids and when I see my kids interacting with other kids,

177
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.550
you can see all this kid's got a strong will to win.

178
00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:26.950
Like they're not going to stop sometimes.
Not even to their own benefit.
Yeah.

179
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.260
I mean they're just not going to stop.
Yeah.
Undoubtedly.

180
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.880
There are certain inherent characteristics which may aid in the development of

181
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:37.710
leadership.
Okay.
This is what I say all the time.

182
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.550
Yet there are assuredly certain men possessing desirable leadership traits who

183
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:48.480
have never attained the statue of the stature of great leaders.
So yeah,

184
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:51.780
you can be naturally gifted leader and guess what?
You're in charge of nothing.

185
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.621
Likewise,

186
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:58.360
there are men deficient in certain of these traits who have attained this

187
00:11:58.361 --> 00:11:59.194
stature.

188
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.850
Any theory that's that leadership is solely inherited,

189
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.110
must be rejected.

190
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.280
Leadership is intangible only to the extent that we make it.

191
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:13.690
So any reasonably intelligent,
morally sound,
forceful man,

192
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.010
no matter how inner inexperienced can become acquainted with the coe component,

193
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.750
elements of leadership,
these elements maybe studied,
practice,
learned,

194
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.020
and applied just as any other human accomplishment maybe learned or mastered.

195
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.740
Now
we have limitations.

196
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.510
You know who Alex Honnold is?

197
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:40.060
He's the guy that climbed El Capitan Free Solo.

198
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.200
Did you see that movie?
What?
Free three solo is the name of the movie.
Okay.

199
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.680
El Capitan.
Have you ever been to Yosemite?
Okay.

200
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:52.510
It's a 3000 foot straight up granite wall.

201
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.180
He climbed the whole thing in three hours with no ropes just hanging on.

202
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:03.460
So my point in bringing up Alex Honnold is that he has a natural gift for

203
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:06.160
climbing,

204
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.960
which he then completely worked and trained and took to the next level.

205
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.790
But
that's the way it is with leadership.

206
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.780
Like there's going to be some people that just have this great natural ability,

207
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.390
which Alex Honnold certainly had a great national ability,

208
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:28.420
but then he worked on it even more.
But even if you took someone that was there,

209
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:30.820
there's people that may want to do what he did,

210
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.720
but they're not physically capable of doing it.
It's just,
uh,
you know,

211
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:37.600
you don't have the physical attributes that are needed.

212
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.380
You don't have the mental attributes because what he did was a mental game too.

213
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.990
You're up 2,800 feet.
Yeah,

214
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.710
so check that out.

215
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.960
Going on back to the book,
the leader and the small group,
every leader,

216
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:57.280
whether civilian or military,

217
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.300
actually maintains close personal contact with only a small group,

218
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:05.890
regardless of the number of men ultimately controlled by him.
Inevitably,

219
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:11.130
he must depend upon that small group in order to make his will known and to

220
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:14.920
execute his purpose.
In the realm of the military,

221
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.520
we refer to the small group as immediate subordinates and staff.

222
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.000
And also this is,
this is decentralized command 100%.

223
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.430
Like you can't control everyone.
You know,

224
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:27.760
if you're in charge of 50 people in a platoon,
you can't control them all.

225
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:31.360
It doesn't work.
You have to use your subordinate leadership to make it work.

226
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.300
Next military leadership.

227
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.310
Military leadership is the art of influencing and directing men to an assigned

228
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:43.390
goal in such a way as to obtain their obedience,
confidence,
respect,

229
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.920
and loyal cooperation.

230
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.060
It is indispensable to success in combat.

231
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.880
Like all leadership.
It is dependent upon personal traits.

232
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:55.640
And upon the application of recognize techniques,

233
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.940
the personal traits can be developed and the techniques can be learned.
Now,

234
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.800
this is important because you might think that,
oh,

235
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.220
uh,

236
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.220
Jockos talking about military leadership now in 2018 and it's a softer,

237
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:14.540
gentler form of leadership that it used to be,
right?

238
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.920
You might think that that,
um,
it's not,
that's the thing.

239
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.040
It's not at no time in the u s military was the best way to lead to bark orders

240
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:27.980
at people.
And that's what they're saying.
This is 1951.

241
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:31.760
So this is post World War II.
Geysir came back from,
from World War II,

242
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.100
from insane fighting,

243
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.280
and they put together this manual and they knew that leap military leadership is

244
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:41.780
the art of influencing.

245
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:48.320
And it goes a little bit deeper right here.
There are two kinds of leadership,
uh,

246
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:50.540
for Tyrian and persuasive.

247
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.040
One Who is predominantly of the authority authoritarian type,

248
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.870
normally is recognized by the dogmatic use of authority or power.

249
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.980
The persuasive type of leadership takes into consideration the human element

250
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.660
with all its complexity.

251
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.770
And with all this differentiation of the physical,
mental,

252
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:14.570
and moral capabilities and limitations of the individual,
to a great extent,

253
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.580
the persuasive leader basis,

254
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:21.260
his skill and leadership upon the example and ability with high standards of

255
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:25.460
discipline and efficiency for himself as well as for her followers.

256
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.700
This manual is concerned solely with the development of the persuasive type of

257
00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:32.000
leadership.

258
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So they got a whole book here and they're gonna spend zero time talking about

259
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:42.590
here's the best way to bark an order at someone because that is not an effective

260
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:43.610
way to lead.
Hmm.

261
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.360
So even in 1951 common out of World War II coming out of the sustained for years

262
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:53.330
of combat,
the military leaders got together and said,
Oh yeah,

263
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:55.940
do we needed to talk about how to bark orders at people?
No,
we don't.

264
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.460
We need to talk about how to persuade,
how to influence.

265
00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.663
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

266
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.410
<v 1>The exercise of command command is the authority that a member of the military</v>

267
00:17:08.411 --> 00:17:12.970
profession lawfully exerts over subordinates by virtue of his rank and

268
00:17:12.971 --> 00:17:17.320
assignment.
Leadership can be exercised by any one at any time,

269
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:21.820
irrespective of the framework of command.
So I'm gonna say that again.
So yeah,

270
00:17:21.821 --> 00:17:24.970
you can use your rank.
That's what they're saying.
Like,
Hey,
you can use your rank,

271
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.900
you have subordinates,
and you can use your rank to order them around.

272
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.960
But leadership can be exercised by anyone at any time,

273
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.930
irrespective of the framework of command.

274
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.960
It is recognize that in any group,

275
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.930
some individual will emerge as the leader.

276
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.470
Even though no command or organizational structure is present,

277
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.920
you put some people together,
there's going to be a leader,

278
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.813
<v 2>they're going to come out.</v>

279
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.240
And this is something I learned when I was running trade ed and Brian and seal

280
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.170
seal platoons.

281
00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:00.150
At first I was really expecting that the platoon chief and the platoon commander

282
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:04.830
would be the leaders and it didn't take me very long to realize,
hey,

283
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:08.760
I'm happy if I get,
if I get a couple of liters in there of any,
any rank,

284
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.970
the platoon's going to do fine as long as the chief and lieutenant don't have

285
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:16.620
big egos and they can,
they can figure out like,
oh goodness,

286
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.870
this kid actually knows more than I do.
I'm just gonna let them run with it,

287
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.650
which is the smart thing to do.
If they can allow their egos,

288
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:25.560
if they can subordinate their egos in that scenario,

289
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.900
then they'll be fine.

290
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.920
If they can't subordinate their egos and they feel like their ego has to be on

291
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:32.490
top,

292
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.820
then they shut that person down and they run things badly and it turns out to be

293
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:38.640
a disaster.
But so here,
once again,

294
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:44.630
no one expects the U s army to be saying in 1951 hey,

295
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:48.570
rent.
The leadership can come from anywhere in the chain of command.

296
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.410
Back to the book.
The leader's responsible not only for initiating action,

297
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:58.140
but for supervising all activities within his command.

298
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.210
The objective of military leadership is the creation and maintenance of an

299
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:07.890
organization which will loyally and willingly accomplish any reasonable task

300
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:12.891
assigned are indicated and we'll initiate suitable action in the absence of

301
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:14.424
orders.

302
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.750
The proper application of the principles of leadership to a command can create

303
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.030
an efficient well disciplined organization,

304
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:23.850
possessing high morale and a spree decor.

305
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.140
And here's going into some of the responsibilities of leadership.
And by the way,

306
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:31.860
I'm,
you know,
I always say,
well,
I'm skipping a bunch here.

307
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.980
I'm actually skipping very little right now because this book is so

308
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.690
straightforward that it's all,
it's almost all important,

309
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:45.620
at least at this juncture in this reading responsibilities of leadership.

310
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:49.920
The responsibilities of the leader are two fold accomplishment of his mission

311
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.730
and the fulfillment of the responsibilities to to his men.

312
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.390
Man is the fundamental instrument of war.

313
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.700
Other instruments may change,

314
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:04.620
new weapons may be created and new modes of defense may be devised.
But man,

315
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.040
the fundamental instrument remains constant.

316
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.700
So there you go.
They agree with me,

317
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.320
the robot's cool.
That's fun.
For Awhile,

318
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.280
how many of them can you build?
Can you build them fast enough?
You know,

319
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.100
and at the end they'll robot thing at the end.
It's like,

320
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:27.060
what you're kind of fighting for isn't a robot decision.
You know,

321
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:28.110
like the thing like,
okay,

322
00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:31.080
I'm going to send these robots to accomplish this or to take out this,
you know,

323
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.800
the,
that thing that they're trying to fight for or against or whatever.
That's a,

324
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.940
that's a man thing.
It's always going to be a man.
Well,

325
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:42.270
we hope it is because when we started getting into Ai,

326
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.250
yeah.
Ai starts to become conscious when it becomes aware.
Yeah.

327
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.460
Then we could have some scenarios

328
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.860
<v 3>go down there.
Oh,
you a little bit sketchy and what been,</v>

329
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:54.790
what do you got to defend your man stuff?
Yeah.
For sure.
You against the robots,

330
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:55.571
which is the,
you know,

331
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:58.830
I guess there's multiple scenarios you can kind of imagine where the one you're

332
00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.140
talking about or I think you were,
it was okay.
Still man against man,

333
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:06.040
but we're just going to use robots to do it.
Yeah.
Even though,
I mean,

334
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:10.450
as of right now anyway.
Yeah.
I guess it could happen.
It doesn't look well.
Anyway,

335
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:11.590
that's a whole nother thing.
But yeah,

336
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:15.490
men against men using robots and then you get man against robots.

337
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:20.290
Robots figure out some stuff.
If it's,
if it's smart,
it's like,
wait,
wait,
wait,

338
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:23.350
wait.
We don't have to fight each other.
In fact,
we're better together.

339
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:28.360
Whereas the robot,
because robots don't have egos anymore,
not that they ever had,

340
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:33.310
but they don't have egos where now you know,
one robot,
he was like,

341
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:36.250
Hey,
I want to be the leader and the other robot,
they don't have it like that,

342
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.971
so they can be,

343
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:39.580
they can go fight each other and then just take it takes one little,

344
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:40.120
what do you call it?

345
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.710
Precedent or two robots kind of accomplished like commission and other robots.

346
00:21:43.711 --> 00:21:46.900
See,
hey wait,
we could have done that if we just work together.
Hey,

347
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:51.901
I learned from it all powered through and then they look at like the man,

348
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.600
it was like,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait a second.
Yeah.

349
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.800
Given that little thing we just learned,

350
00:21:56.801 --> 00:22:00.820
this man is sorta in the way and then they kind of rube best way to oppose this

351
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:04.270
mission would be to get rid of that dude.
Yep.
And then the other,

352
00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:07.300
and then what you get rid of one man.
Oh shoot.
Other men respond.

353
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.820
They got to kind of jump in and go,
oh,
here's more of these men.

354
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.320
Let me recruit more of our new robot.
Our robots.
Exactly right.

355
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:18.010
But at the end of that little scenario,
so sorry for bringing this up.

356
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:23.910
This scenario,
the man has to fight for the fan interest and you know,

357
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.000
talking a little,
that's never,

358
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:29.020
I mean it's hard to imagine that that ever change the fundamental instrument of

359
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:31.660
war is man.
And that remains constant.

360
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.660
So back to the book,
the leader must be concerned with the desires,

361
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:39.220
needs and mental state of his men.

362
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.420
If the leader knows and understands certain basic principles of human behavior,

363
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.710
if he appreciates that most men reacting fixed and definite ways under given

364
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:50.860
stimulus or influence.
If he recognizes,

365
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.270
develops and applies those traits of character which will produce the correct

366
00:22:55.271 --> 00:22:59.290
reactions in his men,
he will possess the basic tools for managing man.

367
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:00.640
He will be leader.
Now,

368
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:05.641
what I just rattled through so quick is is so important.

369
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:11.170
That's basically what this podcast is about.
I'm going to read it again.

370
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:17.250
If the leader knows and understands certain basic principles of human behavior,

371
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:25.770
if he appreciates that most men react in a fixed and definite ways under a given

372
00:23:27.221 --> 00:23:30.970
stimulus or influence.
If he recognizes,

373
00:23:30.971 --> 00:23:35.140
develops and applies those traits of character which will produce the correct

374
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:36.580
reactions in his men,

375
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.530
he will possess the basic tools for managing men.
He will be a leader.

376
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.250
That's what this podcast is actually about.
Understanding

377
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.240
<v 1>those things</v>

378
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:53.390
since effective leadership in battle is the ultimate goal of military
leadership.

379
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:57.770
It is obvious that regardless of the leader's ability to dominate or persuade,

380
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.070
his success inevitably be inevitably depends upon his skill in the tactical

381
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:04.280
control of his unit.

382
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:08.390
Tactical control is a technique developed by study and practice.

383
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.800
Next accomplishment of the mission.

384
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.110
The primary duty of the leader is the accomplishment of his assigned mission.

385
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.670
Everything else,
even the welfare of his men,
his subordinate.

386
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.040
Okay,
so

387
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.860
here's where I will throw this out at you all day long.

388
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.680
1951 book,
I'm going to throw a Trump card on you.

389
00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.830
Okay?
You have your mission.

390
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:41.550
If you put the welfare of your men below,

391
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:46.090
you're assigned to mission.
What happens on your next mission?
Failure.

392
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.180
You don't have any men left.
Yeah,
you don't have any loyalty.

393
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.340
You've sacrificed your guys.

394
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:55.120
They're looking at you like you let him into a bloodbath.
So,

395
00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:57.580
<v 0>okay,</v>

396
00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.180
<v 1>you,
you have to actually,
this is one of the,
this is the,
you know,</v>

397
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.120
this is the big,
this is the opening chapter of the dichotomy of leadership.

398
00:25:04.121 --> 00:25:08.410
It's called the ultimate dichotomy because this is the hardest thing to balance

399
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.110
because yes,
you do have to accomplish your mission,
but yes,

400
00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:12.760
you do have to take care of your men.

401
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.600
And I don't believe that the welfare of your men is subordinated to executing

402
00:25:16.601 --> 00:25:20.980
the mission.
I don't believe that because if you do that one time,

403
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.190
who's going to get just one mission?
And by the way,

404
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.430
if I order you to take your men and,

405
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.300
and that's the one mission you get and it get,
it destroys all your men in you.

406
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.680
What happened to the next guy that I try in order to do that too?
They're,

407
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.710
they're not going to be loyal to me because I already have shown that don't care

408
00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:41.770
about the lives of the troops.
Now,

409
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.860
are there times where a mission is so strategically critical that there will be

410
00:25:49.541 --> 00:25:54.100
great sacrifice including this sacrifice of everyone involved?
Yeah,

411
00:25:54.101 --> 00:25:58.120
that can happen.
It doesn't happen very often,
but like the,
the,
um,

412
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.270
the Chernobyl disaster in Russia,
the,

413
00:26:01.271 --> 00:26:05.500
I think it was like the first 87 firefighters that were there,

414
00:26:05.501 --> 00:26:07.210
they just all fought the fire until they died.

415
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.400
They just did their best and every one of them knew they were going to die and

416
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:12.730
they just went in there and fought and didn't do their best to control that

417
00:26:12.731 --> 00:26:16.840
situation.
So whoever ordered them in there was like,
Yep,
we're going in there.

418
00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:18.610
And they all said,
Yep,
we've got to do the best we can.

419
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.950
And then they just started bringing in military guys who go in and shovel sand

420
00:26:23.951 --> 00:26:26.830
on the fire for two minutes and 20 seconds.

421
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.540
And in that two minutes and 20 seconds,

422
00:26:28.541 --> 00:26:33.370
they got their lifetime dose of radiation and then they were done.

423
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.790
They,
I know,
I'm throwing these out there like I'm no one,

424
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:38.680
but it's something like that.
That's what happened.

425
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.500
So yes,
you have to take care your men.

426
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.500
And if you don't take care of your men while you're trying to accomplish your

427
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:46.860
mission,

428
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.590
you're going to end up in a situation where you don't have any men left or you

429
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:52.590
don't have any loyalty,
and it actually goes into that a little bit.

430
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:54.390
Next to your duties,
duties to the men.

431
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:59.550
The next responsibility of the leader lives with his,
with his duty to his men.

432
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.960
It is rarely possible to accomplish any mission without attention to the morale

433
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.070
and the sprit of the men in the military service.

434
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.730
The follower is dependent upon his leader.

435
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.080
He can do little to improve his lot if his leader,

436
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.530
if his leader neglects him,
so you've got to take care of your people.

437
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.363
That's the bottom line.

438
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.790
There are four characteristics of a command that are accurate indications of

439
00:27:26.101 --> 00:27:30.810
success or failure in the exercise of leadership.
Number one,

440
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.653
discipline.

441
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:39.410
Military discipline is a state of order and obedience existing within a command.

442
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:44.070
It involves the ready subordination of the will of the individual for the good

443
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:44.904
of the group.

444
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.940
Military discipline is an extension and a specialized application of the

445
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:55.310
discipline of any organized society.
Now pay attention.

446
00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.860
True discipline demands habitual but reasoned obedience to command and obedience

447
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:09.441
that preserves initiative and functions unfalteringly even in the absence of the

448
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:15.000
commander.
So,
so even though this discipline is ob as about obedience,

449
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.460
it's about reasoned obedience.

450
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.250
It doesn't eliminate initiative,

451
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.210
it doesn't take away your ability to think.

452
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.000
That's the kind of discipline that is needed.

453
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.120
Discipline is created within a command by training,

454
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.040
by judicious use of punishment and reward and by instilling a sense of

455
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.970
confidence and responsibility and each individual discipline demands correct

456
00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:39.990
performance of duty,

457
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.320
the need for discipline as best inculcated in an individual by appealing to his

458
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:49.980
sense of reason.
In other words,

459
00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:52.170
making sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing.

460
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.100
In the few instances where appeal to reason fails,

461
00:28:56.101 --> 00:29:00.720
the use of punishment is effective in causing the recalcitrant individual to

462
00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:03.840
conform and perhaps to appreciate the need for discipline,

463
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.280
commendation and earned praise from the senior to a subordinate,

464
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.220
either individually or collectively for task well done,

465
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:16.020
served to strengthen the disciplinary bonds which bind together the smooth

466
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.450
functioning team.
So there you go.

467
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.860
Number one most important thing is good old discipline.

468
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.830
Next thing.
Morale.
Morale is a mental and emotional state.

469
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.700
The importance of morale cannot be overestimated since it is a great

470
00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:35.070
contributing factor to the efficiency of a unit.

471
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.100
Good morale is an indicated by zeal or the voluntary effort which give to their

472
00:29:41.891 --> 00:29:46.891
tasks over and beyond the perfunctory obedience to commands and regulations and

473
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:52.381
a basic sense of personal worth founded on confidence in leaders training

474
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:58.081
weapons and equipment and last satisfaction or the pride of the individual in

475
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:01.000
the accomplishment of the assigned mission.

476
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.240
So that's important that even if you are able to bark orders at people and get

477
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:10.300
them to do what you want me to do,
they're not going to do it with any zeal.

478
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.450
They're just going to do the bare minimum and the bare minimum is not going to

479
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:14.980
be good enough in a combat situation.

480
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.770
Esprit de Corps is the mental and emotional state of the unit.

481
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.600
It is distinguished from morale,

482
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:26.500
which is described as the mental and emotional state of the individual.

483
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:31.120
Esprit de Corps is not a simple summation of the morale of the individuals in

484
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:31.840
the unit.

485
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.840
Rather it results from the total interaction of the personnel of the unit toward

486
00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:42.040
one another and with the circumstances in which the unit is placed.

487
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:48.140
So you get morale,
which is hey,

488
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:53.230
how we do individually and then you combine that together and then you know

489
00:30:54.051 --> 00:30:57.400
it's,
it's the,
the uh,
the,
the sum is greater than the parts.
So you did just,

490
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.890
you just don't add up the morale of the individuals that you take all of that

491
00:31:00.891 --> 00:31:03.240
morale and then you put it through the,

492
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.750
the calculus that is a little bit hard to quantify that results in a spree decor

493
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.720
when the unit is spree is high.

494
00:31:11.721 --> 00:31:15.770
The collective goals of the unit overshadow those of the individual members.

495
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.660
In such instances,

496
00:31:17.661 --> 00:31:22.550
the personal dissatisfactions of some individuals are overshadowed,

497
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.350
shadowed by the prevailing group spirit unit achievement both past and present

498
00:31:27.351 --> 00:31:29.690
is a strong force in raising a spree decor.

499
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.290
A unit with high esprit De Corps can accomplish its mission in spite of

500
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.810
seemingly insurmountable odds.

501
00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.880
Esprit de Corps is enhanced when the group identification is increased and

502
00:31:40.881 --> 00:31:43.880
conversely is lowered when it is decreased.

503
00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:49.670
It has been proved that pride in the unit was the outstanding manifestation of

504
00:31:49.671 --> 00:31:51.410
good morale in world war two.

505
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:56.420
This was accomplished by good officer to enlisted personnel relationships.

506
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:57.523
Now,

507
00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.980
as much as everyone talks about how bad identity politics are,

508
00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.130
right?
Because we don't want to identify with the group,

509
00:32:07.131 --> 00:32:11.450
we want to be identified as an individual.
But when you're in a military unit,

510
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.380
you want to have some of that collective identity.
You want to say,
hey,

511
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.710
where the hundred and first airborne division and we are proud of that.

512
00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:26.270
Or Hey,
we,
when I was at seal team one as a young seal,
it was like,

513
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.460
you know,
we,
we're seal team one.

514
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.770
Have you ever told you are a little more or a little underground motto?

515
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.980
Team one,
it's not just a number,
it's an

516
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.820
<v 2>attitude,</v>

517
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.220
which is the reason I laugh is because that's just completely ridiculous,
right?

518
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:49.790
To even think that.
But it was,
you know,
we,

519
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.560
we kind of joked about that,
but we kind of took it seriously too.
Well,

520
00:32:53.561 --> 00:32:57.950
yeah know when you're inside.
Oh yeah,
big time.
So that building,

521
00:32:57.951 --> 00:32:59.120
that unit identity,

522
00:32:59.121 --> 00:33:02.270
and you see this all the time and all kinds of groups and it's just unfortunate.

523
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.970
It's unfortunate when it goes over to the political realm and when people start

524
00:33:07.971 --> 00:33:08.781
being the biggest,

525
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:13.100
the best thing that they've got going for them is that I'm a white guy.

526
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.830
Or the best thing that I've got going for me is I'm a black dude.
Yeah.

527
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.340
Like that's not what we,
that's not the group that's not there.

528
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.630
That's not the group identity you want to,
you want to cherish.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

529
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.950
because especially when those are,

530
00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:28.820
and I'm not going to go in that direction obviously because we're talking about

531
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:32.570
somebody else,
but especially if it sounds like you're about to go inside.

532
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:37.130
I'm a little bit,
you said you are.
If you're part of a group in voluntarily,

533
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.410
you know,
so you know,
be like [inaudible]

534
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:46.270
the group's going to be less cohesive if you're like proclaiming that hey this

535
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:50.240
is the group and this is what we're functioning as like this is when we're

536
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:52.790
functioning as a group because of this quality.
You know,

537
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:55.190
meanwhile there's like people that have that quality of that,
right?

538
00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:57.320
We're not part of that group so it's not as cohesive.

539
00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:02.330
It's like okay we all are on team one cause we all pursued this so we're all in

540
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:07.100
it and then boom,
yes we can,
we can have,
you know,
it's not just a number,

541
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.780
it's an attitude and then everyone's going to sign on everybody.
Not,

542
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:16.280
not everyone's side on just,
there is a lot of guys that left.

543
00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:20.930
He won because we had that attitude they were down to team five for,

544
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.380
they were like,
dude,
it's awesome.
Down good.
Every lot less stressful.

545
00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.540
The big thing like team one had uniform,

546
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.280
no one had a uniform inspections on the west coast and,

547
00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:34.350
and team won the first Tuesday of every month you had a uniform inspection.

548
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.850
And then the second Tuesday,

549
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:41.600
the first and the second Tuesday or the first and the third Tuesday of every

550
00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:45.320
month you had a haircut inspection.
This is in the day.

551
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.510
You did not make up that room.
But that was the old school professionalism,

552
00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:53.000
that White,
that's why team one was like the,
they,
you know,

553
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:57.160
what do you know what the other team's nicknamed team one Starlog team teamwork.

554
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.760
Like it was a stall log,
like we were in prison camp because it was so strict.

555
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:07.190
But quite frankly,
that I,
I took a lot away from that,
you know,

556
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:12.191
and I kind of always identified with that professionalism and that was a good

557
00:35:12.771 --> 00:35:15.350
thing,
especially when viewed from the outside.

558
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.700
So there was a little bit of a fascist,
I guess,

559
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.500
lineage.
Right.

560
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.460
And when you hear Jordan Peterson talk about like orderliness and all that
stuff,

561
00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:27.410
we'll team one was all about that kind of thing.

562
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.910
This is a little bit more fascist,

563
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.340
whereas team five for instance,
where we're Jason Gardner was,

564
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.160
they were kind of loose were they were a little bit out there.

565
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.260
<v 1>Is that the time he had blonde hair?
Yeah.
Yeah,</v>

566
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.220
Jason Garner had bleached blonde hair,
but you know we all,

567
00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:47.040
I mean I had long hair at the time in long sideburns and stuff.

568
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:49.910
I thought it was Lemmy from Motorhead and things like that.
Yeah,
yeah,

569
00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:54.390
probably where so
group identity,

570
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.760
unit identity,
so important.

571
00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:01.680
The the guys that we work with over in Iraq,
in Ramadi,
those guys had their,

572
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.960
their battle streamers that they,
a Nair tactical operation center,

573
00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:11.460
they had pictures of pictures,
a World War II newspaper clippings.

574
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.480
They brought him on deployment to hang up in their tactical operations center to

575
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:18.740
hang up in their chow hall.
So when you walked in and out,
if you were a,

576
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:23.700
if you were a soldier from the first of the five oh six or you are a soldier

577
00:36:23.701 --> 00:36:25.830
from the one three seven you would see that stuff.

578
00:36:25.831 --> 00:36:28.410
You would realize you would get that group identity.

579
00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:32.610
You would feel that a spree decor and that's a pretty powerful tool.

580
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:34.831
Last one,

581
00:36:34.831 --> 00:36:39.831
efficiency is the ability to accomplish successfully in assign task in a

582
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:44.070
shortest possible time with the minimum expenditure of means and with the least

583
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:45.000
possible confusion.

584
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:50.001
Efficiency in a command is built by sound training and by effective

585
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:53.370
administration.
It is enhanced by good discipline,
high morale,

586
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.383
and Esprit de Corps.

587
00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.910
I liked that one because it reminded me of the whole show we did on judo and

588
00:37:00.911 --> 00:37:03.490
just talking about the importance of efficiency.

589
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.430
Moving on onto some psychology.
Leadership is closely linked with psychology.

590
00:37:09.431 --> 00:37:13.300
The study of human behavior proved principles of leadership include proved

591
00:37:13.301 --> 00:37:14.590
principles of psychology.

592
00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.920
It is known that human beings tend to react similarly under a given set of

593
00:37:20.141 --> 00:37:24.580
conditions.
From a leadership standpoint,
some of these reactions are favorable,

594
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:29.080
some unfavorable with a knowledge of how human beings tend to respond to a

595
00:37:29.081 --> 00:37:33.460
particular set of circumstances and with a comprehension of the basic factors

596
00:37:33.461 --> 00:37:35.020
that control human behavior.

597
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:40.290
The leader can capitalize on favorable reactions and minimize tendencies toward

598
00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.570
unfavorable ones.
It is evident therefore,

599
00:37:43.571 --> 00:37:47.080
that a knowledge of psychology is helpful to the leader.

600
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:49.463
<v 0>Okay.</v>

601
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:53.330
<v 1>That's something that I have more recently been saying because I just thought it</v>

602
00:37:53.331 --> 00:37:54.200
was human nature,

603
00:37:54.201 --> 00:37:58.850
but now I'm starting to realize that human nature and psychology is one big bowl

604
00:37:58.851 --> 00:38:00.590
of stuff that's all related.

605
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.593
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

606
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:08.580
<v 1>Ethics.
The science of moral duty is closely allied with the art of leadership.</v>

607
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:12.750
In order to set the example for his men and to win their confidence and respect,

608
00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:16.440
the leader must be capable of deciding whether a given course of action is

609
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:18.510
morally right or wrong.

610
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

611
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.360
<v 1>Temporizing with principles and moral standards may secure a temporary advantage</v>

612
00:38:27.411 --> 00:38:30.320
or fleeting popularity.
So if you,
if you,

613
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.800
if you adapt your morals a little bit from time to time,

614
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.900
if hesitate to really impose your,
your,

615
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.010
your actual beliefs on something,
you can get a little popular for a moment,

616
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:48.360
but in the end only strict adherence to high standards of honor and integrity

617
00:38:48.361 --> 00:38:50.610
will prove of value to the leader.

618
00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:56.490
So important.
All right,

619
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.320
now we get kind of into the meat,
we'll call it the meat of this discussion.

620
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.990
Principles of military leadership,

621
00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:10.110
the principals of military leadership discussed below are equally applicable to

622
00:39:10.111 --> 00:39:13.560
all levels of command from the squad to the army group.

623
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:20.210
Principle one no your job to know his job thoroughly.

624
00:39:20.761 --> 00:39:23.070
The leader must possess a wide field of knowledge.

625
00:39:23.071 --> 00:39:27.750
He must understand the technical aspects of the operation of his command.

626
00:39:27.751 --> 00:39:31.260
And the methods and procedures of organization,
administration,
instruction,

627
00:39:31.261 --> 00:39:32.280
and personnel management.

628
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.810
The leader should also possess a sound understanding of human relations further,

629
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.450
he should have a working knowledge of the duties,
responsibilities,

630
00:39:39.451 --> 00:39:42.990
and problems of his subordinates.
If he commands a service unit,

631
00:39:42.991 --> 00:39:46.590
he should have knowledge of combat operations.
So there you go.

632
00:39:46.591 --> 00:39:49.500
Principle one no your job

633
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:52.110
<v 0>principal too.</v>

634
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.510
<v 1>Know yourself and seek improvement.</v>

635
00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.730
It is the duty of every leader to evaluate himself and to recognize his strength

636
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:05.470
and weaknesses and individual who does not know his own capabilities and

637
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:09.910
limitations is not master of himself and can never hope to be a leader.

638
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.351
Likewise,

639
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:15.970
an individual who realizes his deficiencies but makes no effort to correct them

640
00:40:15.971 --> 00:40:17.260
will fail.
As a leader.

641
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.820
The study of leadership principles and practice of sound leadership techniques,

642
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.640
we'll develop leadership ability,

643
00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.440
so know yourself and seek improvement.
That's principle number two.

644
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:31.443
<v 0>Hmm?</v>

645
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.240
<v 1>Going all the way back to Sun Su,
no yourself.</v>

646
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:40.830
Principle three know your men and look out for their welfare

647
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:47.450
by making a conscientious effort to observe the members of his command as often

648
00:40:47.701 --> 00:40:50.850
as possible to become personally acquainted with them,

649
00:40:50.851 --> 00:40:55.050
to recognize their individual differences and to share in their joys and
sorrows.

650
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.550
The leader will have a better understanding of how his subordinates react and

651
00:40:59.551 --> 00:41:01.200
function under various conditions.

652
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:06.060
You will then be able to employ them more effectively by assuring himself that

653
00:41:06.061 --> 00:41:08.160
the members of his command are as comfortable,

654
00:41:08.161 --> 00:41:11.850
well cared for and contented as circumstances will permit.

655
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.590
The leader wins their confidence,

656
00:41:13.591 --> 00:41:17.160
respect and cooperation by neglecting their welfare.

657
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:22.340
The leader indicates indifference and as a consequence forfeits the trust and

658
00:41:22.771 --> 00:41:24.150
confidence of his men.

659
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:30.970
So principle number three
is know your men and look out for their,

660
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.480
for their,
for their welfare,

661
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:37.690
which is because they said the mission was more important,

662
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.790
but what they're saying is take care of your men.

663
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:46.550
Principle four keep your men informed.

664
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.380
The soldier who is well informed about the mission and situation and about the

665
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:55.910
purpose of his particular task is considerably more effective than one who is

666
00:41:55.911 --> 00:41:58.580
not so informed.
The better.
He is informed,

667
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:01.400
the better he can perform his tasks with maximum initiative.

668
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.570
The commander who fails to make essential information available to his men.

669
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:10.550
We'll soon find out that they are performing blindly without purpose.

670
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.201
At the same time,

671
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:15.800
commanders at all levels must realize that security requirements imposed

672
00:42:15.801 --> 00:42:18.830
limitations on information which may be imparted to the mat.

673
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.840
Keep your men informed.

674
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.780
The lesson that I learned in the back of a long sealed patrol,

675
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.640
no one telling me what was going on.

676
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.270
None of us in the back know have any idea where we are,
where we're going,

677
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:36.920
when we're going to stop.
It's a nightmare.
Keep your men informed.

678
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.440
Principle five set the example.

679
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:43.160
Men instinctively look to their leaders for patterns of conduct,

680
00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:47.930
which they may either emulate or use an excuse for their own shortcomings.

681
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:49.560
They're always watching you.

682
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:55.160
The classic example of the military leader that isn't that is is that of an

683
00:42:55.161 --> 00:42:58.970
individual whose appearance and conduct evoke from his subordinates praise,

684
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:04.160
pride and the desire to emulate him by his outstanding performance of duty.

685
00:43:04.161 --> 00:43:07.160
The leader must set the standard for the entire command.

686
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:13.240
The commander who appears in an unfavorable light before his men destroys the

687
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:15.290
respect that must exist,

688
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.700
exist mutually between him and has been before leadership can be exercised.

689
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.300
So don't look like a loser.

690
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.480
Principles six ensure that the task is understood,

691
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:33.080
supervised and accomplished.
So now we're getting into the mission,
right?

692
00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.960
Number six.
Number three was take care of your people.

693
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:38.510
The leader must give clear,

694
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:42.290
concise orders that cannot be misunderstood,

695
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.200
which is I always say simple,
clear,
concise.

696
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.330
I guess I rip them off.

697
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.080
Then by close supervision,

698
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:54.170
he must ensure that those orders are properly executed.

699
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.040
The issuance of an order as the initial and relatively small part of the

700
00:43:58.041 --> 00:43:59.330
commander's responsibility,

701
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:03.650
his principle responsibility lies in supervision to make sure that the orders

702
00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:04.700
properly executed.

703
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.590
It is this responsibility that is most difficult to carry out.

704
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.760
The able leader will make wise use of his subordinates to carry out his

705
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:15.230
supervision effectively.

706
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.830
Any commander of a large unit who fails to make proper and adequate use of his

707
00:44:18.831 --> 00:44:23.210
staff and subordinates demonstrates a fundamentally a fundamental weakness in

708
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:26.870
his leadership capability,
which the weaknesses he's not utilizing.

709
00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.830
Centralized Command.
And,
and for this one,
this is a little,

710
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:36.890
I think what we have to pay attention to is you give the task and then you

711
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:39.260
supervise it and you make sure it's accomplished,

712
00:44:39.261 --> 00:44:41.720
but you have to be careful that you're not giving the task and then micro

713
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.310
managing it because then you're going to lose track because you can't

714
00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:49.050
micromanage everything that's going on.
So you have to supervise,

715
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:51.270
you have to check back in,
but you can't micromanage.

716
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.220
Principle number seven,
train your men as a team.

717
00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:01.830
The duty of every leader includes the development of teamwork through and

718
00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:04.890
thorough through the thorough training of his command,

719
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.620
whether it be squad or an army group.

720
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:12.180
Modern armies are complex organizations involving many different arms and

721
00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:16.590
services all working together as a team.
Toward a common end,

722
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:20.790
each part of the team must understand where it fits into the common effort.

723
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:25.650
The commander who fails to foster teamwork while training his command will not

724
00:45:25.651 --> 00:45:30.510
obtain the desired degree of unit efficiency.
So principle number seven,

725
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.230
train your men as a team.

726
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.533
Principle eight

727
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.710
make sound and timely decisions.

728
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.860
The ability to make a rapid estimate of the situation and arrive at a sound

729
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:48.870
decision is essential to a leader.

730
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.440
He must be able to reason logically under the most trying conditions.
He must,

731
00:45:54.441 --> 00:45:55.350
aside quickly,

732
00:45:55.351 --> 00:45:59.250
what action is necessary in order to take advantage of the opportunities as they

733
00:45:59.251 --> 00:46:00.084
occur.

734
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.070
The vacillating commander not only will be unable to employ his command

735
00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:09.030
effectively,
but would create vacillation lack of confidence,

736
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.660
hesitation and indecision within the command itself.

737
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:18.770
The ability to make sound and timely decisions can be acquired by constant study

738
00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:23.310
and by training in making estimates.
On the other hand,
when circumstance,

739
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.100
when circumstances dictate a change in plan,

740
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:30.990
the able leader will act promptly without fear that the command may consider

741
00:46:30.991 --> 00:46:35.070
such action as of vacillation.
So yeah,
you've got to make good decisions.

742
00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:38.580
And then if you make a bad decision,
you just say,
hey,
that was wrong.

743
00:46:38.581 --> 00:46:41.910
We're moving to this other direction.
Now my boss,
let's roll.

744
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:45.443
Principle nine,

745
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:51.900
seek responsibility and develop a sense of responsibility among subordinates.

746
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:53.490
This is about ownership.

747
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.770
The leader must be quick to seize initiative in the absence of instructions from

748
00:46:58.771 --> 00:47:01.860
his superior by seeking responsibility of the leader,

749
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:05.190
develops himself professionally and increases his potential ability.

750
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:09.600
Proper delegation of authority is a sound attribute of leadership.

751
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:14.370
The commander then holds his subordinate strictly responsible for the results

752
00:47:14.371 --> 00:47:18.360
and rarely the methods of procedure.
So what he's saying there is a,

753
00:47:18.361 --> 00:47:20.790
you tell people what to do,
not how to do it.

754
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.430
You let them figure out the methods of procedure,

755
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:28.290
such action by the commander in genders,
trust,
faith and confidence.

756
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.570
So when I give someone a mission and I don't tell him specifically every little

757
00:47:31.571 --> 00:47:34.000
detail of how I want it done,
there's just let them run with it.

758
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:35.710
That means they know good,

759
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:38.470
I trust them and that develops trust back in my direction for me.

760
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:44.800
If it develops initiative and whole hearted cooperation,

761
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:49.830
reluctance to delegate authority often is the mark of retarded growth in

762
00:47:50.081 --> 00:47:54.190
leadership.
So seek responsibility,

763
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.310
but more important,
give that responsibility,

764
00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.440
give that ownership down the chain of command.

765
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:05.380
Principle 10 employ your command in accordance with its capabilities

766
00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.000
to employ his command properly.

767
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:11.150
Leader must have a thorough knowledge of the tactical and administrative

768
00:48:11.151 --> 00:48:13.340
capabilities and limitations of his command.

769
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.090
He must assign objectives that are possible of attainment.

770
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.760
That's a good one.
Sometimes I see business leaders,
you know,

771
00:48:20.761 --> 00:48:25.761
they're all fired up and they throw things at their teams that are not

772
00:48:25.921 --> 00:48:29.150
achievable and I'll say,
well,
do you think they can really pull it off?
Well,

773
00:48:29.151 --> 00:48:29.850
I don't know if the ball,

774
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:33.240
you don't want to give them that good stretch goal and meanwhile,

775
00:48:33.241 --> 00:48:36.600
no one thinks they can even hit the goal.
So they don't even try.
You know,

776
00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:38.940
you can see this all day with kids.
If they,

777
00:48:38.941 --> 00:48:40.670
if you give them something that's dead,
they,

778
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:44.100
that they figure out that they can't achieve it all,
they'll just stop trying.

779
00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:47.220
And it's the same thing with adults.
It's human nature.
Makes Sense.

780
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.060
Is that what it's called?
The stretch goal?
Yeah.

781
00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:54.870
That's what sales people and other people do.

782
00:48:54.871 --> 00:48:57.770
But sales groups at companies,
they'll call it a stretch goal.
Liquid.
We,

783
00:48:57.771 --> 00:49:00.370
we got our stretch goal.
Gotcha.
Yeah.
We've got a stretch goal.

784
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:03.540
We're going to sell for $80 billion in the next four weeks.

785
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:08.040
The teams like that means we're doing the do you know,

786
00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.710
400 times what we've ever done in a full year.

787
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.390
We're going to do that in two weeks.
That's not realistic.

788
00:49:12.391 --> 00:49:13.960
I'm just going to do what I normally do.
Yeah.

789
00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:21.000
To do less than this may spell failure.

790
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:22.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

791
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:23.800
<v 1>In accomplishing the mission,</v>

792
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.930
recurrent failure brings about collapse of morale,
a spree decor and efficiency.

793
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:30.101
So that's another thing.

794
00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:33.160
When you give these goals that are unattainable and you do it repeatedly,

795
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:36.400
people start thinking,
well,
we're not even good enough.
It starts to hurt morale.

796
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.770
However,
on occasion when the situation demands,

797
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:40.660
men must be pushed without hesitation beyond,

798
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:44.530
they're considered capabilities in order to achieve a quick and cheap victory or

799
00:49:44.531 --> 00:49:48.490
to avoid a costly defeat.
So yeah,
sometimes you got to dig in

800
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.630
and the last principle,

801
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.230
principle 11 when this is going to come as a big surprise,

802
00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:00.110
take responsibility for your actions.

803
00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:06.400
The commander of a unit is responsible for all his unit does or fails to do.

804
00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:14.010
They didn't know about extreme ownership back in 1951 apparently.

805
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:17.820
Yeah,
I guess they called it something else.

806
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:21.600
They didn't come up with as good of a name trumped him with the name.

807
00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:27.170
The leader recognizes and acknowledges this responsibility on all occasions.

808
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:33.490
Any effort to evade this responsibility destroys the bond of loyalty and respect

809
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:37.310
that must exist between the commander and his subordinates.
Take

810
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:39.891
responsibility,

811
00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:44.891
take extreme ownership for your actions for everything the unit does or fails to

812
00:50:45.921 --> 00:50:49.640
do.
You own it all.
All right,

813
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.700
so there's your 11 principles of leadership.

814
00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:55.340
Now it gets into some leadership traits.

815
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.450
Leadership traits are human qualities that are of great value to the leader.

816
00:50:59.451 --> 00:51:03.620
Possession of these leadership traits simplifies the task of applying leadership

817
00:51:03.621 --> 00:51:07.220
principles and assist greatly in winning confidence,

818
00:51:07.221 --> 00:51:08.810
respect and cooperation

819
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:14.810
and individual can benefit by studying the traits considered important to the

820
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:18.950
leader.
By careful self analysis and application,

821
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:24.130
he can develop those traits in which he is deficient and further strengthen the

822
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:28.280
ones in which he is strong.
So you got to look at yourself.

823
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.830
You got to see which one of these traits are good,
which ones are bad,

824
00:51:30.831 --> 00:51:34.370
which one are you good at?
Which one are you weak at?
Need to figure those out.

825
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:40.330
A study of our nation's great military leaders reveals that none possessed all

826
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.010
the leadership traits to the maximum degree,

827
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.960
but that a weakness in some traits was more than compensated for by strength.

828
00:51:47.961 --> 00:51:48.794
And others,

829
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.980
critical self analysis will enable an individual to realize the traits in which

830
00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:58.100
he is strong and to capitalize upon them at the same time.

831
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:01.880
He must endeavor to improve those traits in which he is weak.

832
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.400
The following is a list of traits.

833
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.490
The following list of traits is by no means all inclusive,

834
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.000
but does contain those of paramount importance to the leader.

835
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.810
So this is a great list of traits,

836
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.870
alertness,
vigilance,

837
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:24.710
promptness and wide awakeness.
So you gotta be alert.
As a leader,

838
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.850
you gotta be in the game.

839
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.800
You ever seen a leader that's like not quite in the game?
Yes.
It's just not good,

840
00:52:30.801 --> 00:52:35.360
right?
No,
you got it.
You got to be in the game.
If you're tired,
if you're napping,

841
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.740
you know if you're sleeping,
if you need a rest,
if you're,
if you're daydreaming.

842
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:42.640
You know what I mean?
You know what's funny is you,

843
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:47.570
you know how I have that tendency sometimes if people are talking to me and I'm

844
00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:51.650
not interested in what they're saying and I know you complained about this.
Well,

845
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:56.400
Dean complains about this.
Yeah.
Uh,
leaf has made some comments about this.

846
00:52:56.410 --> 00:53:00.380
They're like,
if you're not,
if you're saying to everybody,
I got everybody.
So,

847
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.630
but when I do that,
people don't think I'm not alert.
Right.
They think like he's,

848
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:08.180
he's just like,
he's alert on something else.
Yeah.

849
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:13.190
You checked out this jock Jocko does not care about what I'm saying right now.

850
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:18.050
Yeah.
So,
but it is rude and I,

851
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:20.960
it is a weakness of mine.
Well,
it's a weakness of mine for sure.

852
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:25.620
So do you do it on purpose?
No,
I don't think it's rude then.

853
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.060
That's

854
00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.510
<v 2>just how,
no,
it's rude.
It's rude for sure.
It's rude for sharing.</v>

855
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:34.020
Can See it's route for sure.
I know that it makes,
I know that it's not a,

856
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:37.470
not a good thing to do.
I know that.
And I don't mean to do it.
Yeah.

857
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.190
That makes it better.
I think it's better.
Well then he can't,
obviously,

858
00:53:41.191 --> 00:53:43.410
it's better that I'm not intentionally doing it.
It's not like,

859
00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:46.440
it's not like you're in mid sentence and I just,
I just go,
you know what?

860
00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:51.110
I just show you the palm and walk away.
Right.
I don't do that.
I just,

861
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:52.290
you'll like,

862
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:54.720
someone will be talking to me and I'll be thinking about something that I need

863
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:56.550
to be thinking about it.
All of a sudden I'll,

864
00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:01.470
maybe I'll turn or all walk or whatever and yeah,

865
00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:04.350
that's disrespectful man.
I shouldn't do that.
That's one of my weaknesses.

866
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.930
But what on the other hand,

867
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:11.310
what if I'm going off on some thing?
You know,

868
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.830
it's possible.
It is possible.
It is possible.
You are correct.

869
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.090
That is a possibility.
Yeah.
So I guess it's like,
it's a spectrum.

870
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:24.280
I mean your way on this side of the spectrum where I need to go off on some

871
00:54:24.281 --> 00:54:28.830
thing and you know,
and you'll still sort of do that sometimes,
but I still,
right,

872
00:54:28.831 --> 00:54:32.580
right.
But it still is not a good thing to,
it'd be better for me to say like,

873
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:36.690
hey man,
you know,
what can you tell me about this later?
Like when I'm 60

874
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.160
because I don't care about it right now and I'm not going to care about it for

875
00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:45.420
another 15 years or whatever.
Okay,
so alertness.

876
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:50.700
Next one is bearing bearing denotes desirable physical appearance,

877
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:55.650
dress and department.
This is important.
Or like just how you,

878
00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:58.740
how you present.
Good.
Right?
What's your bearing or you slouched over?

879
00:54:59.130 --> 00:54:59.850
I went and worked.

880
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:04.850
I went in to talk to some underprivileged kids and these underprivileged kids

881
00:55:05.161 --> 00:55:09.120
weren't,
I would say the type of kids they were,

882
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:14.150
they were underprivileged kids who were really smart and in a bad situation,

883
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:21.110
not under privileged kids who were not quite as smart and kind of just making

884
00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:25.410
their way in that underprivileged world.

885
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:29.160
These kids were getting beat down by their world and I went there and talked to

886
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:30.870
him and I was going to talk about humility.
Right?

887
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:36.690
And as I kind of got towards the humility part,
I was,

888
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.400
I said to myself,
I don't need to talk to these people,

889
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:41.070
these kids about humility adult.
These kids are overly humble.

890
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:43.520
These kids are beat down.
These kids need confidence.
Right?
Right.

891
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.050
And what they needed was they needed to Barry,
right.

892
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.450
They needed to stand up straight.
Right.
That's what they needed.

893
00:55:48.451 --> 00:55:51.360
They needed to sit in their chairs.
Or when they asked the question,

894
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:53.310
I started making them,
Hey,
when you asked me a question,
stand up,

895
00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:56.430
stand up and ask the question.
I wasn't being a jerk.
And I was like,
hey,

896
00:55:56.431 --> 00:55:58.410
we stand up.
You know,
let everyone see you.
Cause they're just,

897
00:55:58.411 --> 00:56:02.610
their confidence was broken by life.
And so you're,

898
00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:07.110
you're bearing is important.
And when someone comes and presents to you and they,

899
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:10.410
they don't seem,
they seem broken.
They seem unconfident.
Yeah.

900
00:56:10.411 --> 00:56:15.180
Your bearings bearings really important.
So that means looking squared away,

901
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.540
that means shown,
you know,

902
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.380
that's why I t you bruiser everyone dressed in the proper uniform.

903
00:56:19.381 --> 00:56:22.830
Everyone had a shaved head.
Everyone had,
you know,

904
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:24.610
everyone did the right things.

905
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.310
So that way when we went to talk to the army and the Marine Corps,

906
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:29.550
they didn't think these guys are idiots.
Yeah.

907
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:35.530
Next courage must be both physical and moral.

908
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:37.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

909
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.340
<v 2>No real expansion needed on that one.
Decisiveness,</v>

910
00:56:40.341 --> 00:56:44.120
the ability to make decisions promptly and when indicated and announce them a

911
00:56:44.121 --> 00:56:46.430
forte.
Dively concisely and clearly.

912
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:55.250
Dependability is the doing of one's duty without supervision.

913
00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:00.680
Endurance,
both mental and physical is necessary to continue and complete.

914
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:02.270
Any reasonable task.

915
00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:08.560
Enthusiasm is positive is the positive zeal or interest in the task at hand.

916
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.170
It is easily communicated to subordinates.
You know,

917
00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:17.540
that's one thing that's so good in the military is you get to see examples of

918
00:57:17.541 --> 00:57:22.340
when people are enthusiastic about a job.
It just changes everything,
right?

919
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:23.060
When you,

920
00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:27.320
when you have people that are not enthusiastic and really all you need is one or

921
00:57:27.321 --> 00:57:30.550
two people that are having a good time and in a soup tune,

922
00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:33.710
you pretty much always have that.
You always have at least someone that's,

923
00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.770
that's just gonna bring it ready to,
to get them ready to go,
ready to go.

924
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
And if it's not you today,
maybe it's you know,
Bill,

925
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:43.640
which apparently bill's been getting a lot of flack recently,

926
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.090
so we'll get bill some credit bills,
bills.

927
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:51.860
Bill has a good day and bill goes to make it happen and everyone sees the bills

928
00:57:51.861 --> 00:57:54.170
crushing it and you're like,
ah,
you know what?
Let's do this.

929
00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.480
Force is the ability to impose one's will upon another.

930
00:58:01.971 --> 00:58:04.970
Now this is an interesting one,
right?
It,
it's an interesting one.

931
00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:10.240
The ability to impose one's will upon another because that doesn't really mesh

932
00:58:10.611 --> 00:58:15.110
too well with the persuasive leadership than I've been bragging to all about

933
00:58:15.111 --> 00:58:19.880
about this book.
You know,
forces like,
hey,
that being said,

934
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:23.723
<v 0>yeah,</v>

935
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.400
<v 2>I understand what they're talking about.</v>

936
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:31.300
I understand that there's people that will not stop until they,

937
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:34.880
they have maneuvered into the position that they want to be in.

938
00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:41.030
So I understand how forced,
and I understand how,
Ha let me put it this way.

939
00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:46.540
If I have a seal platoon and I've got a task that needs to get done and there's

940
00:58:46.761 --> 00:58:51.761
someone in the seal platoon that has a high level of force and I can say,

941
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:56.900
hey bill,
go make this happen.
And bill goes,
got it.
You know,

942
00:58:56.901 --> 00:58:59.060
he's gonna make it happen.
Right?
Yeah.
So there,

943
00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:03.700
and he might not necessarily use force as his primary tool to make it happen.

944
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:07.130
He might go and be butter someone up or get some,
you know,

945
00:59:07.131 --> 00:59:10.610
massage some ego and make something happen that's still using force.

946
00:59:10.611 --> 00:59:13.460
It's just using gay,
an indirect force.

947
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:18.170
So that's where I think we're talking about next is humility.

948
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

949
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:23.780
<v 2>Which is freedom,
arrogance,
and unjustifiable pride.</v>

950
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.300
Talk about humility all the time.

951
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:31.540
Humor is the capacity to appreciate the many amusing or whimsical happenings of

952
00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:37.190
our everyday life,
especially those which pertain to the leader himself.

953
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:41.990
So don't take yourself too seriously.
I did a video the other day,

954
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:47.510
like a Monday morning video you're talking about.
Yeah.

955
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:52.570
And it was April fool's day and I got super serious and I kind of went off April

956
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.550
fool's day is weak or whatever.

957
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:59.810
I just kind of went off of this big thing and a couple of people,

958
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:00.920
I think it was two people

959
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.120
responded with,
you know,
I couldn't even watch this.
You do.

960
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.520
There's nothing wrong with having fun.
I just said,
hey man,

961
01:00:13.521 --> 01:00:17.240
watch the whole video.
I'm laughing at the end.
It's,
it's okay dude,
I get it.

962
01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:21.020
Anything that triggered are so maybe they got triggered.
I Dunno.
Yeah,

963
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:24.470
you said so I think you posted something like a written thing about how you're

964
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:24.831
like,
Hey,

965
01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:28.100
today is like one of those days where I need more recovery or something like

966
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:28.400
that.

967
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.410
Basically indicating that you are going to take a rest day or whatever and then

968
01:00:31.411 --> 01:00:35.570
know,
put a post April fool's day.
That was what,
last year.
Oh No,
you're right.

969
01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:38.170
I did do that this year,
which is weird.

970
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.350
I don't know why probably I always fall for those.
I'm like,
oh yeah,

971
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.220
I was thinking of when date or whatever and yeah,
and you did another one too.

972
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.790
I think it might've been last year and I was like totally falling for it.

973
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.360
April four last year I think I was in Montana and I was eating Moose tracks the

974
01:00:56.011 --> 01:00:58.670
ice cream or that and that made a big joke and I was like,
Hey,
you know,

975
01:00:58.671 --> 01:01:00.790
I've been eating Moose tracks and I just,
I'm,
I'm,

976
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:03.560
I'm thinking maybe I've just been too extreme with his whole deal

977
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.680
and to delight.
No,
no.
Anyways,
so yes,

978
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:12.980
you've got to be able to,
you got to have built,
I think,
I think it's important.

979
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.600
It's not just having fun,
but the important part,

980
01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:20.610
the most important part of humor is realizing that you yourself are going to be

981
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:24.260
the butt of jokes and that's okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

982
01:01:24.261 --> 01:01:26.660
And we were talking about that before where,
you know,
the guy who,

983
01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:29.930
who can't take it and more so than they can't take it,

984
01:01:29.931 --> 01:01:33.650
it's just like you feel uncomfortable joking around with him.
You know,

985
01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:35.080
you can joke around everybody else in them,

986
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.560
but when they're around is kind of like,
hey,

987
01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:38.300
we shouldn't really joke around as much.

988
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:41.090
And that sort of the dynamic one they're around.
Yeah.
And it's not even,

989
01:01:41.091 --> 01:01:44.420
it's not even,
I shouldn't joke around.
I shouldn't joke around about that person.

990
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:45.940
That's what you're talking about.
Yeah,

991
01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.490
because there's some people they love to have fun and then the minute the mirror

992
01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:53.000
shines a dem or the light shines on them and they become the butt of the joke.

993
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.290
They don't like it at all.
And even if,
um,
even if they're like,

994
01:01:57.291 --> 01:02:00.680
they don't respond in this negative will,
even if the person is more,
is just,

995
01:02:00.681 --> 01:02:04.250
they just be quiet,
you know,
that kind of were like,
they don't necessarily like

996
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.490
getting mad,
but they're just making little,
they'd just get quiet.
Exactly.

997
01:02:10.491 --> 01:02:12.500
It's like you just can sort of tell,
you know,

998
01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:15.120
there's like a dynamic when you joke zone,

999
01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:19.200
this wicked land,
no one wants you around,
man.

1000
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:23.700
Sure we'll do the job boss.
Sure.
But man,
no one wants you around.

1001
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:27.150
Go back into your eyes.
Keep your sense of humor,
especially about yourself.

1002
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:34.070
I have,
I have a good time with that.
I have no issue with that.
You know,

1003
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.770
another thing I think is if,
if you,
if somebody says something to you,

1004
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:42.300
like makes a joke about you and it hurts you,

1005
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:43.170
that's,

1006
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:46.770
that's your ego and there's probably truth in what they're saying and so you

1007
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:50.940
need to pay attention to it.
How does ego feed into insecurity?

1008
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:55.260
Because you know how like,
cause a lot of them is insecurity cause it,

1009
01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.600
it over compensates.
Yeah.
So if I'm insecure about,

1010
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.330
if I'm insecure of welfare,

1011
01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:09.150
I'm insecure about my leadership capabilities that I try and blow up and act

1012
01:03:09.151 --> 01:03:13.140
like a big leader.
That's basically it.
Because your ego is like,
Hey,
I can't,

1013
01:03:13.141 --> 01:03:18.141
like I can't deal with this little like shortcoming in whatever way that's in my

1014
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:22.350
mind or whatever.
Right.
So I'm gonna you overcompensate.
That's where you see it.

1015
01:03:22.351 --> 01:03:24.600
And then if someone jokes around about it,

1016
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.690
it kind of like shoe shines light on it.
Ooh,
you don't like that stinks.
Yeah,

1017
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:31.740
but it's all on your own.
Well,
most of the time it didn't like in your own mind,

1018
01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.270
you know how bad it is.

1019
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.740
Next one initiative is the willingness to act in the absence of orders and to

1020
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:43.200
offer well-considered recommendations for the improvement of the command.

1021
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.580
Awesome.
Got To have initiative.

1022
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.650
Next is integrity is the honesty and moral character of the leader that must be

1023
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:54.480
unquestioned.
Intelligence is the intellect of the leader,

1024
01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:57.390
which must be adequate to match to the problems presented by his level.

1025
01:03:57.391 --> 01:04:02.391
Command judgement is the power of the mind to weigh various factors and arrive

1026
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:04.640
at a wise decision and you know what?

1027
01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:07.800
They talked about making decisions and one thing that I didn't really talk
about,

1028
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.610
I didn't emphasize too much is how do you get better decision making?

1029
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.850
You get better at decision making by training you better decision making by

1030
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:18.810
putting yourself into situations where,
hey,
this is what's happening and Oh,

1031
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.180
here's the decision I'm going to make.
Oh,
it was completely wrong.
Cool.

1032
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.450
I just learned not to make that type of decision before.
Let me try it again.

1033
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.180
When I was running a trade at out here for the west coast,

1034
01:04:27.181 --> 01:04:30.570
that was the whole goal was to put guys into situations.

1035
01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:33.420
They had to make a decision.
They would make wrong decisions all the time.

1036
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.790
And then I knew they would not make that wrong decision again because once you

1037
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:42.570
make it and you feel it and it stings and your whole platoon is covered in paint

1038
01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:46.950
ball and they're murdered,
well you won't make that bad decision again.

1039
01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.850
And that was the goal.
Uh,

1040
01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.880
justice is being equitable and impartial in bestowing favors and punishment.

1041
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:59.160
Loyalty must extend both up and down.

1042
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.410
A leader cannot expect loyalty from his subordinates unless he is conspicuously

1043
01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:08.880
loyal to them and to his superiors as a big one.

1044
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:14.580
Right?
If you're running around talking smack about your bosses,

1045
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:17.980
that's showing your team that debt,
you're not

1046
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.740
<v 1>loyal to him.
And we'll,
we could go down the whole road of,</v>

1047
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:25.030
if I have a horrible boss,
does that mean I just am a yes man?
No,

1048
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.610
I'll frame things for the guys to make them realize,
look,

1049
01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:30.040
I know there's some shortfalls here,
but we got who we got.

1050
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:33.860
What we're going to do is build a great relationship with them and then we'll,

1051
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.490
we'll,
we'll at least have some saying what's going on.

1052
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:42.010
So if you see me and it seems like I'm just trying to,
trying to massage my boss,

1053
01:05:42.011 --> 01:05:45.070
his ego.
Guess what I'm trying to do,
trying to massage my boss is eagle.

1054
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:47.980
I want to have a great relationship with them so I can take care of us.

1055
01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:52.630
And besides what do we want to do lose influence over him.

1056
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.780
Do you want him to not listen to anything?
I say no.

1057
01:05:56.830 --> 01:06:00.850
So that's what I'm doing
because if you just,

1058
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:05.410
if your boss is an idiot and all you do is support them a hundred percent your

1059
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:08.330
guys are going to start thinking you're an idiot and that's not good.
Yeah.

1060
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:13.690
So there's a fine line.
That's a tough one to walk.
Yeah.
That's tough one to walk,

1061
01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:15.730
man.
That's good man.
It's like a full,

1062
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:19.180
it's like a full disclosure situation where it's like,
hey,
I get it.

1063
01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:20.560
I get what you guys are saying or whatever,

1064
01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:23.080
but this is why we're doing it kind of thing.
Because like how you say,

1065
01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.730
if you follow the boss who's,

1066
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.230
who's a quote unquote idiot and then you seem like it it.

1067
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.200
And then on the other hand,
if you're like,

1068
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:33.540
be nice to the boss and you know being nice and then when you go to your middle

1069
01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:36.790
and like it's so dumb.
It's like talking kind of behind his back.
You're like,
oh,

1070
01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:39.560
you're two faced a little bit and you don't have to say,
Hey,
the Boston media,

1071
01:06:39.561 --> 01:06:41.560
we're just trying to,
I'm just trying to butter them up.
No,
you say like,

1072
01:06:41.561 --> 01:06:45.010
hey listen,
the boss doesn't always see things the way I see him,

1073
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:45.671
but you know what?

1074
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:48.640
He is the boss and what I'm trying to do is build a good relationship with them.

1075
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:49.900
I'm trying to do a good job,

1076
01:06:49.901 --> 01:06:53.800
said he listens to what I say so that I can influence them and steer them in the

1077
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:56.770
right direction on some of these things so that we can accomplish our mission

1078
01:06:56.771 --> 01:06:58.930
better.
I just got asked this by a swat guy.

1079
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:03.550
I was out with the police out North Carolina in,

1080
01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:09.030
in Charlotte and you know it was the typical question of what do you do when

1081
01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:12.700
your boss is telling you to do something that you don't necessarily agree with

1082
01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.550
and it's like,
okay,
we can talk about that.

1083
01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:19.810
And I went down the whole road because it is a whole road because if your boss

1084
01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:22.750
is telling you something that's insignificant telling you to do something that

1085
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:24.250
really doesn't make that much of difference,

1086
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.460
then you just do it and you've built that relationship a little bit more.

1087
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.290
They take you to do something else as a kind of insignificant.

1088
01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.560
Maybe it's not the smartest thing.
Maybe there's a more efficient way.

1089
01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.890
Is that really what you want to fall on your sword for and create a

1090
01:07:35.891 --> 01:07:38.890
dysfunctional relationship with your boss?
No.
You're like,
hey boss,
got it.

1091
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.510
Sounds like a good idea.
Hey,
we'll make it happen.

1092
01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.550
And then that goes on and you continue to build relationships.

1093
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.140
So then eventually when your boss tells you to do something that is actually

1094
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:51.070
unsafe or unsound or an ethical,

1095
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:52.660
unethical is a different story.

1096
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.730
Cause if someone's telling you do something unethical,

1097
01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.970
well it's actually not a different story because if they're telling you to do

1098
01:07:57.971 --> 01:08:02.950
something unethical and you say,
no,
I will,
no,
I will not do that.
They go,

1099
01:08:02.951 --> 01:08:07.150
cool,
you're fired.
And now who's going to come in?
Yes ma'am.

1100
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:10.930
And now no one's protecting the guys.
So,

1101
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.160
so yes,
you don't just,
you don't just give

1102
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.810
<v 2>blind loyalty,
but at the same time you try and build relationships.</v>

1103
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:22.220
That's what you do.
Yeah.

1104
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:27.160
In jacked your influence later,
whatever.
Right?
In the big,

1105
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:30.940
you put it a real good way a few times where I think it was just at the monster,

1106
01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:34.550
I'm not sure,
I don't know why he said it exactly,
but how you were like,
Hey,

1107
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.730
if I'm a leader and my guy,
and this goes both ways by the way.

1108
01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:42.770
So if I'm a leader and I have a hundred percent solution to a problem and then,

1109
01:08:42.771 --> 01:08:46.520
but my guy comes in and he has a 75 80% solution,

1110
01:08:46.521 --> 01:08:50.330
I'm going with 80 right.
So it could be in these,
in the situation where your,

1111
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:52.520
your question example of what if I disagree with my boss.

1112
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.140
Is that why you're disagreeing?

1113
01:08:54.141 --> 01:08:57.660
Because you're over here with hundreds and he's over here with eight 85 or even

1114
01:08:57.661 --> 01:09:00.290
90 sometimes there's like look how much,
I mean,
you know,

1115
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:05.270
so I disagree with your plan cause you're,
you know,
it could be that.
Got It boss.

1116
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.660
Let's do it.
Yeah,
I'm good.
That goes up and down the chain of command.

1117
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:09.583
You are correct.

1118
01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:14.300
The classic example of this is in band of brothers.

1119
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.330
When Dick winters gets tasked,

1120
01:09:17.331 --> 01:09:21.220
his guys to go over and do reconnaissance across the river,
they go,

1121
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:24.080
they do the reconnaissance,
they get in a firefight,
they lose a guy.

1122
01:09:24.081 --> 01:09:25.730
It's a disaster to come back.

1123
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.920
And then Dick Winters boss says do it again tomorrow night.
And the,
by the way,

1124
01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:35.150
the water like all but over at this point.
And he says,
okay boss.

1125
01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:37.670
And then he goes and tells his guys,
Hey,

1126
01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:43.130
go and go in the cellar of one of these buildings and sit there for four hours

1127
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:45.860
and then come back and I'm going to tell him that you guys didn't see anything.

1128
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:49.610
And that's what they do.
So that is disobeying an order.

1129
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:55.100
That is,
that's what it is.
But it wasn't the right thing to do.

1130
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:58.790
Yes it was.
Why would you put more guys at risk and to say,
boss,

1131
01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:02.390
I totally disagree.
I'm not doing it.
He just said,
okay fine,
you're fired.

1132
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:06.530
Winners gimme another a young officer and I'll make him go do it.

1133
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:10.040
And the other guy who's trying to get up the chain of command,

1134
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:12.290
he does it and then gets another guy killed.
Yeah.

1135
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:17.420
So there are situations and of course is that like the norm?

1136
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:21.380
No,
I'm not saying that's the norm.
I'm saying in an extreme case,

1137
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.110
the war's almost over.
We just lost a guy.
This,

1138
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:28.010
this reconnaissance has no impact on the war whatsoever.

1139
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.170
If they weren't even going to planning to go and fight,

1140
01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.410
it was just a recon just to just to do it.
And so it was like,
no,

1141
01:10:33.411 --> 01:10:35.660
we're not doing that.
Yeah.
So

1142
01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.570
that's it.
Loyalty,
try and build that loyalty up and down the chain of command.

1143
01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:46.580
Sympathy is the capacity of sharing the feelings of those with whom one is

1144
01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:49.180
associated.
Yeah.
You know,

1145
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:52.670
I don't like to talk about feelings very much actually you don't.

1146
01:10:52.671 --> 01:10:54.290
But the thing in practice,

1147
01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.710
like you do that surprisingly good and I don't want to say supporting like I'm

1148
01:10:57.711 --> 01:11:02.711
surprised but sometimes I'm pretty impressed with your sympathetic abilities,

1149
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.230
I guess empathy,
right?
Empathy.
Like I understand where you're coming from and I,

1150
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:08.991
you know,

1151
01:11:08.991 --> 01:11:12.740
I always use the word perspective and I think maybe it's just because it's a

1152
01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:17.490
more of a tougher word,
you know?
Then feelings.
Sure.
But I'll say,

1153
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.300
hey,
you need to cause,
cause let's face it,
it won't sound right if I say,

1154
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:25.470
hey listen,
platoon commander,
you need to really just,

1155
01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:29.340
just reach out and touch the feelings of your men.
Right.

1156
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.140
That doesn't sound right.
Does it from,
no,
no,
it doesn't sound right.

1157
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.750
Factually.
Can I say,
Hey,
listen,
between commander,

1158
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:39.570
you need to understand the perspective that you guys are seeing this from.
Yeah.

1159
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:43.860
You need to see that they're thinking you're just driving them to do something

1160
01:11:43.861 --> 01:11:46.260
that doesn't matter or whatever.
It's the same thing,

1161
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:51.180
but I use tougher works cause you know that's how I roll.
Yeah.

1162
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:56.700
You know when I'll come to you with like this conundrum or something going on in

1163
01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.170
roles,
but you're talking about with humans now with people.
Yeah.

1164
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:02.640
And even you,

1165
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:06.960
your sympathy kind of towards me where it may be on the surface you might sort

1166
01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:09.720
of expect you to be like,
like,

1167
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.470
oh man up or you know something like this,
but you'll like,

1168
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:18.330
you'll kind of give me my do like sympathy.
Even with what you say,
like you'll,

1169
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:22.230
you'll sympathize.
Like you'll be like,
hey,
you're like man,
that is a bummer.

1170
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.210
Or whatever,
you know,
like whatever the words you say.

1171
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:28.890
Well the thing is if I didn't do that then I you have,

1172
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.350
you won't want to listen to what I'm actually about telling you to do.
Yeah.

1173
01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:35.480
Because sometimes the solution is hard.
Yeah.
Right.

1174
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:39.120
Sometimes the solutions to these things are hard.
And

1175
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.130
if you don't open up that door a little bit to build a little something,

1176
01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.510
then you're just not,
you're just going to say,
oh yeah,
it,
what,

1177
01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:53.511
what you'll think is I'm not Jocko and what he says doesn't apply to me.

1178
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:56.760
Yes,
yeah,
that's what's happening.

1179
01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:59.130
Or you need to just cut away or whatever.

1180
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.660
You need to just tell that person no more like,
no,
I have,
you have,
man,

1181
01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.500
that's a rough situation to be in.
I think what's going to happen here,
I mean,

1182
01:13:07.501 --> 01:13:08.910
if you view weigh it out,

1183
01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.810
the only real solution is for you to kind of back away from that scenario.

1184
01:13:12.811 --> 01:13:14.820
You know what I mean?
So it kind of brought you in,

1185
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.140
made you think that I'm human and then we'll,
there we go.
I'm thinking,

1186
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.420
uh,

1187
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:26.190
next tact is the ability to deal with subordinates and superiors in an

1188
01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:29.100
inappropriate manner without giving offense.
Boy,

1189
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:33.540
that seems like so simple,
but man,

1190
01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:37.470
tact people got mad or didn't get mad.
What did I say?

1191
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:42.471
I said tact trumps the truth on a podcast whenever.

1192
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:46.590
Yeah.
And some people when all Sam Harris on me,

1193
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.860
no,
you will never,
ever.

1194
01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:57.870
And then I brought up 48 examples of where,
oh,

1195
01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:01.500
so what you should do is just be truthful at all times.

1196
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:06.630
No ma'am.
Um,
you know,

1197
01:14:06.631 --> 01:14:09.090
there's times where what I thought you,

1198
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.990
your performance I thought was pathetic and embarrassing in disastrous.

1199
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.980
Yeah.
And yet you're in the position,
I need you to do a good job.

1200
01:14:17.981 --> 01:14:20.950
I need your morale to stay high.
I see that you're beat down yourself.

1201
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.270
So instead of telling you all those things,
I preemptively tell you,
hey,
look,

1202
01:14:25.271 --> 01:14:26.710
this was a really hard task.

1203
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.160
And I know it was challenging and you probably weren't quite ready because I

1204
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:31.540
didn't give you enough information.

1205
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:36.250
But here's some things I think will help next time around.
Right.

1206
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.390
I didn't tell you the full truth.
I mean,
I didn't lie to you either.

1207
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:45.490
So maybe that's,
so maybe that's the difference between Sam Harris and Jordan,

1208
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:50.500
because what Jordan Peterson says is tell the truth or at least don't lie.

1209
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:53.620
So there's,
there's a little gray area between those two.

1210
01:14:53.621 --> 01:14:57.370
Let's spark another debate between those two guys.
Yeah.
Shoot.

1211
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:58.990
I kind of in a way agree with both,

1212
01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:03.160
if I even understand them 100% but yeah,
like the,
you know,

1213
01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:05.770
cause there's all kinds of lies and the lying by omission.

1214
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.910
And then the other one they say white lies and then they say,
but uh,

1215
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:12.310
I think it's black lies.
What is that I for?

1216
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.590
But lying by omission or whatever,
it's like you're telling the truth,

1217
01:15:17.591 --> 01:15:20.410
but you're leaving out stuff to kind of lead them in a certain direction or

1218
01:15:20.411 --> 01:15:23.260
whatever to make them think certain stuff.
There's,
then there's that,
you know,

1219
01:15:23.261 --> 01:15:25.460
so it's like,
all right,
it Kenny,
like I said,

1220
01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:30.100
if you get into a lot of gray area there,
and I guess there's times where,

1221
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.270
you know,
the classic example that I guess Sam Harris talks about is,

1222
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:39.970
should you tell your wife when your wife comes out and says,
do I look fat?

1223
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:43.120
What you should say is yes,

1224
01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.060
maybe no,
that enthusiast.
Right,
right,
right.
But to his point,

1225
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.360
if you don't say that,
well then yeah,
you let her,

1226
01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.120
you can let her continue on whatever path she's on.
But that's not good.

1227
01:15:55.121 --> 01:15:57.670
And ends up in a bad way.
So,
so a little bit of credit there,

1228
01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:02.410
but to give a little push back on Sam,

1229
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.750
if you are just straight up a jerk about it.
Well guess what?

1230
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:09.580
We haven't done what we just talked about,

1231
01:16:09.581 --> 01:16:14.440
which is I haven't built a little bridge and connected and said,
you know,

1232
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:19.500
and so now all she's going to do daily and then now we have an anger situation

1233
01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:21.880
now and they might not listen to anything that you're going to say and now we

1234
01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:26.020
might ruin a relationship based on the fact that we went to hardcore.
Now,

1235
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:27.070
to Sam's point,

1236
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:31.150
if you don't ever indicate any kind of truth and you just let a person continue

1237
01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:35.860
on a path that uh,
bad for them and is bad for their,
in this case,
their weight,

1238
01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.850
well then that's not good either.
But the key component,

1239
01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:41.980
if you have tact and you build the relationship,

1240
01:16:41.981 --> 01:16:45.820
because basically I think I had this conversation with Lafe a little while ago.

1241
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:48.910
You know,
when you're dealing with someone,
when you're dealing with a team,

1242
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.790
you're either forwarding and improving the relationship or you know,

1243
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:57.760
you could be neutral or you're making it go backwards.

1244
01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:03.480
What we want to be doing is improving the relationship at a minimum.

1245
01:17:03.611 --> 01:17:07.610
We want to remain neutral and every other aspect of going backwards in the

1246
01:17:07.611 --> 01:17:10.970
interrelationship is bad.
So we're business partners and we have a,

1247
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:12.530
we have a discussion about something.

1248
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:16.920
I want the result of that discussion to be that our relationship improved.
Yeah.

1249
01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.410
At a minimum I wanted to be neutral and worst case we've actually gone backwards

1250
01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:26.150
cause that's not not good.
So now when you start talking about your spouse,

1251
01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.610
we want that relationship to improve.

1252
01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:33.530
We don't want it to go backwards and neutral is a minimum.
So when we,

1253
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:36.110
when we get asked the question,
do I look fat?

1254
01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:40.150
And the answer is absolutely yes.
That's going to be,
that's good.

1255
01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:44.680
That's not going to lead to,
that's not going to lead to the,

1256
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.650
the,

1257
01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:49.280
it's not going to lead to your spouse respecting and listening to what you're

1258
01:17:49.281 --> 01:17:53.060
saying.
It's going to lead your spouse saying,
oh,
you're a jerk.
Yeah.

1259
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:56.960
You don't know how hard it is for me.
You're not part of my team.

1260
01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.860
You're on a different team.
And therefore,
since we're on different teams,

1261
01:18:00.861 --> 01:18:02.750
I don't need to listen to anything that you say.
Yeah.

1262
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:08.000
So there's better way to go about it then.
That's called tact.

1263
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.230
Yeah.
And then to have these talks with my brother,

1264
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.720
she'd from time to time.

1265
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:19.730
And so an example is like if you,
like if you're a corrector,

1266
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.450
you know,
guy like you use a word wrong or sale,
we're pronounce a word wrong,

1267
01:18:23.451 --> 01:18:27.880
like the guy who's so quick to always correct in front of people,

1268
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:30.800
whatever.
You know you're a corrector.

1269
01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:35.810
Usually those correctors people,
those correct.
Or people are there.
Right.

1270
01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.500
You know,
and then they're telling the truth.
It's true.
It's correct.
You know?

1271
01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.440
So what they're saying is correct and they're lonely

1272
01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:48.770
because look no tact.
Right.
So that what they're saying is correct.

1273
01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.220
What they're doing is not correct.
Like you shouldn't do that.

1274
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.350
And that's like essentially what tact is.
You know,
it,

1275
01:18:55.351 --> 01:18:58.310
it's not like you were saying,
hey,
did I say that right?
And you're like,
hey,

1276
01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.390
you know,
you didn't say that.
Right.

1277
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:03.610
And it's different to to pull someone aside and say,
hey man,
hey,

1278
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:08.150
just want to let you know you mispronounce this word right now.
Yeah,

1279
01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.190
there's an eye.

1280
01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.650
I don't like the fact that I mispronounced words and I do it on this podcast on

1281
01:19:12.651 --> 01:19:17.300
a fairly regular basis.
And occasionally someone will hit me up and say,

1282
01:19:17.301 --> 01:19:21.060
hey you,
you mispronounce this word or that word.
Someone sent me a,
uh,

1283
01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:23.450
either an email or something the other day that was like,

1284
01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:25.130
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1285
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:28.280
<v 2>you mispronounced words.
This would not be that hard to fix.</v>

1286
01:19:28.281 --> 01:19:31.320
You should pay attention or whatever.
Something like that was pretty,
pretty,
uh,

1287
01:19:32.230 --> 01:19:36.680
pretty straight forward.
Right.
And I was like,
yeah,
you know,
that's a bummer.

1288
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:38.630
Um,
cause the thing is,

1289
01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.220
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1290
01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:46.220
<v 2>I don't like mispronouncing words and yet the corrective measures for not</v>

1291
01:19:48.691 --> 01:19:49.920
mispronouncing words.

1292
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:51.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1293
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.540
<v 2>Is it,
for instance,
if we're going and I'll,</v>

1294
01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:58.440
all of a sudden I'm saying something wrong and I'm like,
hold on,
let me go back.

1295
01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.600
Let me interrupt.
What I'm my thought pattern.

1296
01:20:00.601 --> 01:20:04.860
Let me interrupt what I'm saying to try and figure out if I pronounce this thing

1297
01:20:04.861 --> 01:20:07.110
right or wrong,
I lean,

1298
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:13.350
it's better to just flow and get corrected later.

1299
01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:18.210
So I apologize for my mispronounced words.
Yeah,
my bust.

1300
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:22.820
I should do a better job.
Like that guy who emailed me that,
I'm sorry.
Uh,

1301
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:25.650
the last one is on the selfishness.

1302
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:31.400
Unselfish unselfishness is the study to avoidance of caring for or providing for

1303
01:20:32.131 --> 01:20:37.131
one's own comfort or advantage at the expense of others.

1304
01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:44.430
Anytime that you as the leader are getting the good deal,

1305
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:46.380
while you're people are getting shafted,

1306
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.390
they notice it and they don't like it.
They didn't like it at all.

1307
01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.080
So,
and it's weird because the military does that.

1308
01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:00.120
That's the way the military operates.
The officers get paid more money,

1309
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.420
the officers live in officer's quarters.

1310
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:09.060
The EAD dogs are down in the bilge of the ship and the hot,

1311
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.710
nasty and just that's the way it is.
So there's a little bit of that,

1312
01:21:13.711 --> 01:21:15.840
but there's,

1313
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:21.200
there's a saying in the military rank has its privileges and it's sort of a

1314
01:21:22.231 --> 01:21:26.340
snobby thing to say in my opinion.
But anyways,

1315
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.680
I guess the point I was going to make is when I had,

1316
01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:30.990
when I had officers that were,

1317
01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.200
that I really had a lot of respect for and they would always downplay that and

1318
01:21:34.201 --> 01:21:37.740
never rub it in your face basically because there is a separation,
hey,

1319
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:39.720
these guys are in a leadership position,

1320
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:43.080
they have more responsibility and therefore they're getting paid more and

1321
01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:44.970
they're getting treated a little bit elevated.

1322
01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.870
But when someone would rub that in your face,

1323
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.450
boy that just does make you mad.

1324
01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:55.750
<v 3>What's the expression when you know your boss or you're with someone who</v>

1325
01:21:55.751 --> 01:21:59.650
outranks you?
It's the,
not necessarily,
it's not in the military,
I don't think,

1326
01:21:59.651 --> 01:22:03.080
but it's something like in this story it's like I have a few more letters you

1327
01:22:03.081 --> 01:22:05.440
might title or something like that,
or a few more now.

1328
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:08.620
Like especially like my title has a few more letters in it,
whatever.

1329
01:22:08.621 --> 01:22:13.600
It's something like that.
Oh yeah.
My boss told me that one time.
Dang.
Yeah,

1330
01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.490
like straight up like I was,
this is in the club days.

1331
01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:20.290
I think I told you this tells you that straight up.
Yeah.
Well here's the thing.

1332
01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.060
So in,
in our club there was an area you couldn't go in if you're,

1333
01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:28.480
he'd had a dress code in this area.
It was like a dumb Jesco too,
by the way.
But,

1334
01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.510
and we all knew it.
Everyone knew it,
that it was kind of dope.
He was like,

1335
01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:32.180
you couldn't wear it.

1336
01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:36.490
<v 2>Jeans.
Yeah,
like jeans.
What about origin jeans?</v>

1337
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:41.760
<v 3>Way before dinner jeans,
unless you couldn't wear jeans,
so whatever.</v>

1338
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:45.480
So one day I was,
it was like I wasn't working and I was wearing jeans.

1339
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:49.050
All my friends were not wearing jeans there with there.
So I kind of go,
right.

1340
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.080
And then my boss was working and he said,
hey,

1341
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:55.920
like you can't be in here with jeans on.
So I'm like,
all right,
Dang.
Okay.

1342
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:58.410
You know,
in front of everybody,
but cool man.
All right.

1343
01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.220
So I left and then it was like a week later he was off.
Same deal.

1344
01:23:02.221 --> 01:23:06.130
That is the roles were reversed.
Oh yeah.
He's up there genes full

1345
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:10.990
<v 2>on like doing it and kick him out.
Jokingly I said,
hey,</v>

1346
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:14.650
you can't be here with jeans,
you know,
and that's what he told me.
He said,

1347
01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:18.090
I have a few more letters in my title day.

1348
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:23.200
He still mad at your
district level for him to go up or down?

1349
01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.330
Well yeah,
I'll put it this way.

1350
01:23:25.331 --> 01:23:28.630
It would have went down if it wasn't that zero already.
So yeah,

1351
01:23:28.631 --> 01:23:32.980
when it went down.
Yeah.
Don't do that.
Be Unselfish.

1352
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:37.000
And the other thing is when you do on selfish things like that,
people notice it.

1353
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:40.660
And if you're doing them,
because hey,
if they also noticed this,

1354
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:44.620
if you're doing something on selfish because you want credit for it,

1355
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:49.960
that doesn't work either straight.
It's like if you're like op there,
you know,

1356
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:53.440
if you're doing something because you want that outcome,
if you're,

1357
01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.510
when you do something for your troops,

1358
01:23:55.511 --> 01:23:57.760
you should do it because you care about your troops,

1359
01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:02.230
not because you're trying to build up a good,
uh,
yeah.

1360
01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:04.900
Good image with your troops.
Sick to know,
man,

1361
01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.830
you guys have been busting your ass for me and I'm going to handle this thing

1362
01:24:08.831 --> 01:24:13.030
over here so you guys can go get some time off.
Go.
It's not,
it's not,
hey,

1363
01:24:13.031 --> 01:24:16.270
if I do this thing for those guys,
Dell,
Dell increased a liking me more.

1364
01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:21.760
Don't do that.
You can tell when guys do that to men.
So everyone can tell.

1365
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:25.160
People don't think people think,
no one notices.
You know,

1366
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:31.360
they noticed that more than the good.
Did what?
Okay,
what about this Phil?

1367
01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:34.470
What about if they,
um,
you know,
highlight and this is a common one where,

1368
01:24:34.471 --> 01:24:39.420
where you make a donation,
right to whatever charity or cause or whatever.
Right?

1369
01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.680
And you said,
we chose,
you know,
and they celebrate.

1370
01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:45.640
We just made this donation to this charity or whatever.
Like how about that?

1371
01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:49.960
Cause that's what you're,
it's kind of doing,
you're publicizing well,
okay,

1372
01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:51.400
I get that people do that.

1373
01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:56.260
And then you take that and you compare that to someone that says,

1374
01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.030
oh well,
like they investigate some politician and then they go,

1375
01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:04.540
there's politicians are,
you know,
a horrible person.
And then investigate them.

1376
01:25:04.541 --> 01:25:07.930
And they find out that he's donated millions of dollars to all these different

1377
01:25:07.931 --> 01:25:09.730
charities,
but never said a word about it.

1378
01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:14.160
Your respect for that person goes up as opposed to someone that's donated

1379
01:25:14.161 --> 01:25:15.430
millions of dollars and he's like,
Hey,

1380
01:25:15.431 --> 01:25:19.930
let's do another photo shoot of me donating.
There's the big giant,
you know,

1381
01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:25.630
four by six check,
Eh,
$100,000 thing on it.

1382
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:29.200
It's at the front of their website.
Front page.
Yeah.

1383
01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:31.690
So at the end of the day it's more about like,
okay,

1384
01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:34.600
so what message was sort of sent and received?

1385
01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:37.270
Like he's the message is the front running message.

1386
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:41.560
The fact that I am so generous that I donate and I do these things,

1387
01:25:41.561 --> 01:25:45.970
or is the message that,
oh my gosh,
it's so good now that this charity,

1388
01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:48.220
whatever it gets the help that they want kind of thing.

1389
01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:52.990
You know what people underestimate all the time.
People underestimate

1390
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:58.690
how well other people can see what's going on.

1391
01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:03.200
I get sleep,
I see people and I say,
man,

1392
01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:07.760
do you really think that anybody you're fooling anyone?

1393
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:10.100
And it usually happens,

1394
01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:15.380
usually happens with people that are,
well,
they're obviously,
they're smart,

1395
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:18.970
but they're there so they think they're so smart,
right?

1396
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:22.460
They think they're so smart.
And I always think to myself,
man,

1397
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:25.850
do you really think that anyone is,

1398
01:26:25.851 --> 01:26:30.020
do you think they're getting this over on anyone?
So we make these mistakes.

1399
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:33.080
Like this is a classic example where you do something cool but you're just doing

1400
01:26:33.081 --> 01:26:37.870
it because you want that credit.
Everybody sees that.
Everybody sees and goes,
Nah,

1401
01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.470
yeah,
he's just doing that to try and look cool.

1402
01:26:39.471 --> 01:26:40.880
Because you know why they know that?

1403
01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:44.420
Because two days ago you screwed them and now you're trying to be all cool.

1404
01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.850
But people make that mistake all the time.

1405
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.800
I'm a hyper sensitive to what other people are like how they perceive.

1406
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.920
I realized that any facade that I put up is just a,

1407
01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:01.370
it's anyone basically.
Anyone can say,
sure you might fall a couple people,

1408
01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:05.750
but people just look at you go,
that's garbage.
I don't believe you,

1409
01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:09.220
<v 3>but it's in a tea and I'm agreeing with you,
but I,</v>

1410
01:27:09.221 --> 01:27:13.510
I'm not agreeing with you and being like you and I don't do that,
bro.
I to me,

1411
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.830
everyone does that.
Literally everyone does it.
And literally everyone is,

1412
01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:21.970
is not like less aware how you say,
it's like we're under what?

1413
01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.430
What'd you say you ate?
Underestimate.
Just how much.
Yeah.

1414
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:27.010
So as to meet everyone and that's why the most,

1415
01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.830
<v 2>that's why the important thing is when you're doing things,</v>

1416
01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:34.900
do them from the place of honesty.

1417
01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:37.600
Right.
Do you know I'll,
I'll say things like,

1418
01:27:37.601 --> 01:27:40.990
I'm trying to think of a good example where I'll say,
hey,
you got to do this,

1419
01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:46.330
and then I'll say,
you've got to do this now.
See what you got to actually meet.

1420
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:47.620
We'll just take it.
I mean,

1421
01:27:47.621 --> 01:27:50.920
the real easy example is like take ownership or something,
right?
I'll say,
yeah,

1422
01:27:50.921 --> 01:27:54.550
you got to take ownership of that,
but I'm not saying,
Hey,
take ownership of that,

1423
01:27:54.551 --> 01:27:58.570
because then everyone will think that you're a Marger and then no one will be

1424
01:27:58.571 --> 01:28:00.850
mad at you.
No,
that's not why you're doing it.

1425
01:28:00.851 --> 01:28:04.360
You're taking ownership because you have to actually believe that you're the one

1426
01:28:04.361 --> 01:28:08.050
that's in charge of that thing,
that you were truly responsible for.

1427
01:28:08.051 --> 01:28:10.000
What had happened when somebody asks me if,

1428
01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:12.520
if I would've taken extreme ownership,
if I would've gotten fired,

1429
01:28:12.521 --> 01:28:16.560
would that have changed my view?
It's like no.
My view was an,

1430
01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.810
is that as the leader,
I'm responsible for everything that happens.

1431
01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:25.300
Truly responsible.
Not,
not.
Hey,
oh,
I read in a book,

1432
01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.960
I read in the,
the FM 10 tack 22 that,

1433
01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:31.300
that I'm supposed to be responsible.

1434
01:28:31.301 --> 01:28:33.790
So I'm gonna raise my hand and say I'm responsible.
No.

1435
01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:37.790
You have to truly believe in it.
In that thing.
Yeah.
And,

1436
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:43.120
and what's good is if you can do that exercise with yourself and say yourself,

1437
01:28:43.121 --> 01:28:46.810
wait a second,
why am I saying this?
Do I truly believe what I'm saying?

1438
01:28:47.230 --> 01:28:50.500
And if you don't,
you have to say,
wait a second.
This isn't,
that's not right.

1439
01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.920
It's not right to do that.
You need to actually believe what you're saying.
Yeah.

1440
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:56.343
And then

1441
01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:59.420
<v 3>after you realize that you,
you know you're not right,</v>

1442
01:28:59.421 --> 01:29:02.280
you look up and realize that everyone else is already

1443
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.610
<v 2>there.
Everyone else already sees that.
You don't believe.
Here's another one.</v>

1444
01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:10.020
When guys,
when a girl breaks up with a guy and the guy's all heartbroken,
right?

1445
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:14.490
And they'll say,
you know,
I don't know what to do and now and I'll say,
look,

1446
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:19.890
you have to not,
you have to not care.
And so what they think,

1447
01:29:19.891 --> 01:29:24.330
I'm saying his act like they don't care.
But I'm not saying that.

1448
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.410
I'm saying you have to not care.
You have to actually not care.

1449
01:29:28.411 --> 01:29:30.300
You have to actually say,
hey,

1450
01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:34.950
this person was not who I thought they were an I don't care that they're gone

1451
01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:38.670
and I'm going to move on.
If you say that that's your best possible outcome.

1452
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:42.570
If all you're doing is acting that way and it still drives you crazy,

1453
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:46.230
it goes back to what we just said.
If you're just acting that way,
guess what?

1454
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:49.950
The female in the situation absolutely knows that you're just trying to act that

1455
01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:52.890
way.
They have the,
I mean,

1456
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.790
human beings have a certain level of perception of,

1457
01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:00.840
of the way other people's emotions are like you can perceive it unconsciously.

1458
01:30:01.831 --> 01:30:05.610
They perceive it unconsciously or consciously.
You know,
it's like you're like,

1459
01:30:05.611 --> 01:30:09.570
I have a dog,
my dog can kind of know what I'm thinking.

1460
01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.040
And that's a damn dog with the brain.
Like the size of a walnut or whatever.

1461
01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:17.310
How big a big a dog's brain is,
right.
Not Big.

1462
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.420
My dog can't speak English.
Right.
But my dog,

1463
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:24.840
if I come home and I,
I go,

1464
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.030
I act a certain way.
Like he knows it.
Yeah.

1465
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:31.800
And so when you act like when you're acting like you don't care,

1466
01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:35.190
that girl can see that you care and it doesn't work.

1467
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.600
You have to actually not care when you are trying to do something good for your

1468
01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:44.490
troops cause you want to win score points with them.
Yeah.

1469
01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:49.170
They know that when you're trying to prop up.
So,
so this is,
okay,

1470
01:30:49.171 --> 01:30:51.570
this is a good example.
When I said,
Hey,

1471
01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.480
I'm trying to build a relationship with a boss.

1472
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:57.240
That's why I'm going to act this way.
Right.

1473
01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.580
That's different cause that boss is going to say,

1474
01:30:59.581 --> 01:31:04.070
oh he's just trying to butter me up.
It's like,
no,
actually,
oh Bossy,

1475
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.130
you want it done that way.

1476
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:08.700
I believe that's the best thing we can do is try and get it done that way.

1477
01:31:08.701 --> 01:31:11.700
So here I go,
I'm gonna make it happen.
It's not,
hey,

1478
01:31:11.701 --> 01:31:14.820
I'm going to skate around and sneak around and try and fool.

1479
01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:17.590
You know I'm going to believe in what I'm doing.
Yeah.

1480
01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:21.030
I'm going to believe that you have some higher intention that you're focused on

1481
01:31:21.031 --> 01:31:24.480
and that's cool with me.
Yeah.
Yeah man.

1482
01:31:24.481 --> 01:31:26.550
That thing you have to take it to the next level,
man.

1483
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:30.930
You have to take it to the next level.
You've got to believe what you're doing.

1484
01:31:31.770 --> 01:31:33.870
You've got to believe it in when you don't.

1485
01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.900
People know every assume that everyone knows.

1486
01:31:36.901 --> 01:31:38.970
It brought my brother we were talking to with me,

1487
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.420
Greg Macintyre and my brother yesterday.
A great treat for whatever great chain.

1488
01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:47.910
And we're basically con like telling my brother,
hey,

1489
01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:51.590
like come back to Jujitsu.
He's been out of the game for awhile and then,
so he's,

1490
01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:56.460
he's making up this total story,
God and our to hear it.
And you know,

1491
01:31:56.461 --> 01:32:00.160
he's good at those debates,
you know?
And he's like,
it's always about this

1492
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.860
<v 3>and this and this and like me and Greg chain or like,</v>

1493
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:05.170
not really saying that much stuff.

1494
01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:09.160
He didn't be like two of his excuses that he knows since he's like sort out of

1495
01:32:09.161 --> 01:32:12.790
shape.
Right.
Or is the,
since he's actually wait to get back in shape,

1496
01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:16.780
that's what we were asking.
But when you ask it direct like that,
it sounds dumb,

1497
01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.990
you know,
so he's like,
no.
Well it's,
no,
it's not that.
It's,
you know,

1498
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:24.010
so if I'm like so exhausted,
you know,
I like,

1499
01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:27.850
I like training and I like kind of conversating with it with everybody at the

1500
01:32:27.851 --> 01:32:32.140
end and stuff like that.
So if I'm like so exhausted from training,

1501
01:32:32.141 --> 01:32:34.270
not only is that experience kind of diminished,

1502
01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.840
then I'm too exhausted to have like a home,
a good conversation.

1503
01:32:38.890 --> 01:32:42.550
He said it way more.
Like,
could you laugh at them?
I will,
Bro,

1504
01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:46.660
if I wanted him to.
Yes,
I was laughing on the inside talking about this.
Right?

1505
01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:50.230
Yes.
And well,
the good thing is,
well Kel,
okay,
so me and,

1506
01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:52.370
and he was right as Greg was sort of leaving,
right?

1507
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:56.530
So I'm looking at Greg's face and Greg has that look on his face that we all

1508
01:32:56.531 --> 01:33:00.960
kind of get,
but Greg really get to that tastes kind of like,
all right bro,

1509
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:04.600
whatever you say kind of thing.
I'm totally not believing right.

1510
01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:08.230
And I'm their madness.
I'm like,
Brad,
can you hear yourself?

1511
01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.920
Like that's not even a believable thing,
you know?

1512
01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:14.320
Can you be so exhausted that you can't talk afterwards?
Can you do that?

1513
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:17.400
Especially,
I'm sure you can if you ran a,
I don't know,

1514
01:33:17.401 --> 01:33:21.120
a hundred marathons with no legs.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
he,

1515
01:33:21.121 --> 01:33:24.520
he can't put it down there.
And we all know that.
So anyway,
so,

1516
01:33:24.610 --> 01:33:27.790
so Greg sort of leaves and leaves it at that and I'm sitting there like kind of

1517
01:33:27.791 --> 01:33:32.500
looking at him and I was like,
just like,
all right,
thanks.
That's,
that's not true.

1518
01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:36.640
You know,
we,
I know why you're not going to go,
it's not a big deal.
You know,

1519
01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:39.990
we have friends that do that same thing like,
oh yeah,
sure I'll be back,

1520
01:33:39.991 --> 01:33:43.090
but I just don't,
I don't want to go tomorrow because of this and that and this.

1521
01:33:43.091 --> 01:33:46.510
And were like,
Bro,
those aren't even like applicable excuses.

1522
01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.470
And he was like,
he's like,
you're right.
He's like,
you're right.
You're right.

1523
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:52.720
100% right.
100 he totally admitted it.

1524
01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:57.040
He back on the map because he was not here today.
No,
no.

1525
01:33:57.850 --> 01:34:00.990
Get back on the mat.
He got good quick to that.

1526
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.540
And that's kind of part of the whole picture.
You know,

1527
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.370
it's like your waist almost.
You think that he will,

1528
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:11.080
he learned,

1529
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:16.060
learned anything from you just by being your twin brother?
No,
no,

1530
01:34:16.061 --> 01:34:17.980
I don't think so.
It's kind of seemed that way to me.

1531
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:21.580
Although his game is very different from yours.
Yeah.

1532
01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:26.300
And maybe from like Troy,
he's like has an analytical mind,
you know?

1533
01:34:26.301 --> 01:34:30.600
So if like if I do it,
like if he asks,
oh here's another thing.
Yes.

1534
01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.770
Kind of indirectly from being my twin brother.

1535
01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.230
So me and him can communicate like spot on.

1536
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:40.060
It's like we won't run into misunderstandings very often.
So if he has,

1537
01:34:40.061 --> 01:34:43.560
if he's lying about not training Jujitsu,
that was without weakness.

1538
01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:47.270
You were talking about you underestimating other perception.

1539
01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:51.250
I was hit that which he has obviously like we all do,
but yeah,

1540
01:34:51.251 --> 01:34:56.130
so if he has a question or he hears me talking about some something Jujitsu

1541
01:34:56.131 --> 01:34:57.980
wise,
he picks up it I think in that

1542
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.960
<v 1>way real quick.
And you know he's,</v>

1543
01:35:00.230 --> 01:35:05.230
you know how to explain things really well to him because you have 40 years of

1544
01:35:05.661 --> 01:35:10.550
common language and experience to say,
Hey,
remember when I do this or hey,

1545
01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:12.050
remember in football on that or hey,

1546
01:35:12.051 --> 01:35:15.320
remember when whatever you've got all this stuff he can communicate through to

1547
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:19.910
the tone.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
So yeah,
so I'd say there's the,
there's that,

1548
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:21.830
you know,
but yeah,
he did.

1549
01:35:21.831 --> 01:35:26.420
He got the interesting thing about underestimating the way that everyone else

1550
01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:31.400
thinks is when you do that,
you first of all,
it's there.

1551
01:35:31.401 --> 01:35:32.234
They know.

1552
01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:37.010
And if you actually just live your life in a way that you're not trying to put

1553
01:35:37.011 --> 01:35:38.750
up fronts and your life is going to be better.

1554
01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:43.100
And if you live your life thinking that,
guess what,

1555
01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.250
at a minimum people are going to,
someone's going to know that this is a front.

1556
01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:48.590
If you do that.
It's kind of like when I told the,

1557
01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:51.860
the told a bunch of soldiers,

1558
01:35:51.861 --> 01:35:55.340
officers that they had a psychopath in their platoon.

1559
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:58.790
I'm like every,
if you're,
if you've got 40 get,

1560
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:03.110
I've went through this with Jordan where I asked him,
I said,
hey,
as I said,

1561
01:36:03.111 --> 01:36:07.460
if you have 40 people in a military unit,
in a platoon,
in an infantry platoon,

1562
01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:12.440
is one of them a sadist?
And he's like,
absolutely.
Absolutely.

1563
01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.720
And then I,
he said one in a hundred is good,

1564
01:36:14.721 --> 01:36:18.820
but in the military you've already eliminated a bunch of,
you know,
we are.
Yeah,

1565
01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:21.500
you've eliminated all nonsales cause there's no,

1566
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:26.330
there's no one that's like not at least has some tendency to,

1567
01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:29.280
to be able to kill people.
Right.
Those people are in the platoon.

1568
01:36:29.281 --> 01:36:32.450
So you've eliminated a bunch of people that have zero chance of being a sadist.

1569
01:36:32.451 --> 01:36:35.000
They're not in there.
So one out of 40 is not bad it.

1570
01:36:35.001 --> 01:36:40.001
So if you treat your platoon as if you have a sadist in there,

1571
01:36:40.221 --> 01:36:42.680
then you'll eliminate that problem from getting out of hand.

1572
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:43.880
So that's what you do.

1573
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
So if you treat your life as if people will see through the lies and the fronts

1574
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:50.630
that you're trying to put up for them,

1575
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:55.040
you'll do better in life and you'll have a better platoon and you'll have a

1576
01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:58.400
better life.
That's good.

1577
01:36:59.690 --> 01:37:02.810
All right.
Leadership techniques.

1578
01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:05.930
It is important to note that in small units,

1579
01:37:05.931 --> 01:37:09.290
the leader can influence and direct his men through close personal contact.

1580
01:37:09.291 --> 01:37:10.280
Whereas in large units,

1581
01:37:10.281 --> 01:37:13.580
he must rely in great measure upon his staff and subordinate commanders to

1582
01:37:13.581 --> 01:37:17.600
assist them in making his leadership effective.
The larger the unit,

1583
01:37:17.601 --> 01:37:20.870
the more complex the problems of leadership,
but the greater cause,

1584
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:25.930
the greater become the means available to the commander to assist him in the

1585
01:37:27.561 --> 01:37:30.800
exercise.
It was leadership.
So as you grow,
problems get more complex,

1586
01:37:30.801 --> 01:37:32.990
but you end up,
when you have more people,
you have more tools.

1587
01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:38.210
The larger unit commander must consider carefully the leadership aspect of all

1588
01:37:38.211 --> 01:37:42.410
basic policies,
which he prescribes or tolerates.
Okay.
This is what's interesting.

1589
01:37:42.411 --> 01:37:45.080
So we work with companies that grow really quickly,

1590
01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.620
especially nowadays in the startup world and the tech world.

1591
01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:53.840
And this is where they have a tough time transitioning because when you're in a

1592
01:37:53.841 --> 01:37:54.674
room,

1593
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:59.700
you're not in an office and you got six people in there,
guess what?

1594
01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:04.050
You're leadership is really easy,
right?
You're,
you're talking to,
you know him,

1595
01:38:04.051 --> 01:38:06.930
you communicate with them.
It gets to 20 people.
Okay?
It's a little bit tricky,

1596
01:38:06.931 --> 01:38:08.700
but still,
you're all in a room.
You're meeting,

1597
01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:11.610
you're seeing each other every day,
30 40 hey,
guess what?

1598
01:38:11.611 --> 01:38:14.910
We're still all pretty much in a room.
Everyone's having lunch.

1599
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.140
We're still a unit.

1600
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.560
All of a sudden it kicks out 200200300 and this is where if you don't insert

1601
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:27.120
good decentralized command,
good leadership tactics in there,

1602
01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:30.180
that's where these tech companies were.

1603
01:38:30.181 --> 01:38:33.510
And it's not just tech companies that any growing company loses it,

1604
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:37.830
they lose it because they haven't put the command structure in place.

1605
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:41.880
So that the vision of the commander and the vision of the leadership gets

1606
01:38:41.881 --> 01:38:44.430
distilled all the way down through the chain of command.

1607
01:38:44.431 --> 01:38:48.960
And now you have people do and things that they shouldn't be doing.
And,
and,
and,

1608
01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:51.300
and I don't necessarily mean they're doing something illegal.

1609
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:54.090
I'm saying they're doing things that don't support the strategic goals of the

1610
01:38:54.091 --> 01:38:56.130
company and it's a problem.

1611
01:38:58.650 --> 01:39:00.420
But as those companies grow,

1612
01:39:00.421 --> 01:39:03.840
what they don't realize is just like this book says,

1613
01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:08.100
you have more tools that you can put into place.
You've gotta,
you've gotta,

1614
01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:12.810
you've got a communications department inside your company whose job is internal

1615
01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:13.644
communications.

1616
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:17.610
So you could be making what you could be making videos and explain to people

1617
01:39:17.611 --> 01:39:20.430
what's going on and given an update.
And you can,
you can do all those things.

1618
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:25.290
You have that capability.
You have VTCs,
right?
You've got video calls,

1619
01:39:25.291 --> 01:39:26.124
you can make you,

1620
01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:30.030
you've got subordinate leadership that can go out there and get in the field and

1621
01:39:30.031 --> 01:39:34.890
make things known.
So there's a way to overcome these problems if you address,

1622
01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:37.260
if you don't address them and you can,
you think,

1623
01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:42.030
if you think you can keep leading a 2000 person organization as if you were

1624
01:39:42.031 --> 01:39:43.080
leading 20 people,

1625
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.050
you're going to have a major issues and then it's not gonna work.

1626
01:39:46.650 --> 01:39:51.390
It's not going to work
back to the book.
Over a period of time,

1627
01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:53.280
the leader will develop techniques of his own,

1628
01:39:53.281 --> 01:39:56.610
which will be better suited to his own personality in which he himself will be

1629
01:39:56.611 --> 01:39:59.880
able to employ effectively.
So yeah,

1630
01:39:59.881 --> 01:40:02.220
you're all going to get your own little leadership techniques.

1631
01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:05.850
And what's I'm telling you where I'm really lucky is I've worked with so many

1632
01:40:05.851 --> 01:40:10.510
different leaders that I just don't know my techniques.
I say,
Hey,
you know,

1633
01:40:10.511 --> 01:40:11.430
what's a good thing to do here?

1634
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.000
My buddy bill used to have an issue with us and you could,
you know,

1635
01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:20.470
so that's kind of Nice.
Now here are some,
uh,

1636
01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.690
leadership techniques.

1637
01:40:21.691 --> 01:40:26.691
These are leadership techniques that apply back to these principles.

1638
01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:31.320
These are applicable to all leaders.
Okay?
So when it comes to knowing your job,

1639
01:40:31.321 --> 01:40:32.250
principal want wanna know your job.

1640
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:36.360
Seek a well rounded military education through attendance at service schools and

1641
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:39.810
through regular independent reading research and study.

1642
01:40:39.930 --> 01:40:42.480
So how do you know your job?

1643
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:45.030
You study another one.

1644
01:40:45.031 --> 01:40:47.850
Keep abreast of the latest techniques in the field of communication in order.

1645
01:40:47.851 --> 01:40:52.350
Facilitate control of your unit and disseminate information.
Three,

1646
01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:55.960
seek out and foster association with capable leaders.

1647
01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.760
Observe and study their actions and application of leadership techniques for

1648
01:41:00.761 --> 01:41:03.980
broadened your field of knowledge through association with officers and men of

1649
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.350
other armed services.

1650
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:12.470
Five seek the opportunity to apply knowledge through exercise.
A command.

1651
01:41:12.471 --> 01:41:16.010
Real leadership is acquired only through constant practice.

1652
01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:19.760
Six avoid over specialization in too narrow field.
Seven,

1653
01:41:19.761 --> 01:41:22.490
keep abreast of current military developments.
Eight,

1654
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:26.000
familiarize yourself with capabilities and limitations of all elements of your

1655
01:41:26.001 --> 01:41:30.170
command by study and through frequent visits to subordinates.
So that's cool.

1656
01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:31.760
No your job.
And I'll tell you what,

1657
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.570
one thing that's impressive as I get to work with a lot of leaders and some of

1658
01:41:35.571 --> 01:41:39.860
these leaders come up through their industry and man,
they are knowledgeable.

1659
01:41:40.670 --> 01:41:43.850
It's impressive,
it's impressive.
But

1660
01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:47.040
where the shortfall is there,

1661
01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:50.010
they're super knowledgeable about their field,

1662
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:53.670
but they don't have the leadership knowledge.
Gotcha.

1663
01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:58.320
So that's what's beneficial about things like this.

1664
01:41:58.321 --> 01:42:00.360
Podcasts like extreme ownership,
like dichotomy,
leadership,

1665
01:42:00.361 --> 01:42:03.570
like the putting this information where people can actually read it and

1666
01:42:03.571 --> 01:42:05.610
understand that they can study because they know their job,

1667
01:42:05.611 --> 01:42:07.230
they know their technical field.
You know,

1668
01:42:07.231 --> 01:42:12.231
that's another thing with e f Overwatch right now is like we're bringing in

1669
01:42:12.241 --> 01:42:17.241
people that don't necessarily have the technical skill inside of a field,

1670
01:42:18.450 --> 01:42:20.550
but they have the leadership experience.

1671
01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:23.940
And it's a lot easier to teach someone in a technical skill than it is to teach

1672
01:42:23.941 --> 01:42:25.500
them leadership.
Because to get leadership,

1673
01:42:25.501 --> 01:42:27.090
the only way you get better leadership is leadership.

1674
01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:34.320
So we're very,
it's been very successful so far and,

1675
01:42:34.321 --> 01:42:37.770
and now we're starting to see employers that say they were a little,
you know,

1676
01:42:37.771 --> 01:42:41.460
you're hesitant because you think,
how do you know anything about whatever.

1677
01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.940
How do you know,
how can someone that's not from this field lead in this field?

1678
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:49.110
Give the person an overview of what the,
what the field is.
Yeah.

1679
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:53.040
And then they take their 22 years,
24 years,

1680
01:42:53.041 --> 01:42:57.060
26 years of real leadership experience and they apply it.
Yeah.

1681
01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:00.640
It's kind of like the human resource department a little bit in a,

1682
01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:05.460
in a small amount of,
right.
Like where,
what about HR?
Hr,
yes.
Legal.

1683
01:43:05.970 --> 01:43:06.211
You know,

1684
01:43:06.211 --> 01:43:09.480
you have this department that they don't really know anything about software or

1685
01:43:09.481 --> 01:43:13.110
nothing like that
and that's your bakery.

1686
01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:16.380
That's a big deal when people are working together,
you know,
kind of thing.
Yeah.

1687
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:19.680
Good,
good,
good analogy.
Okay.

1688
01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:24.030
Here's some things and techniques for principal to know yourself and seek self

1689
01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:26.370
improvement.
Ah,
one,

1690
01:43:26.371 --> 01:43:30.660
analyze yourself objectively to determine the strong and weak points of your

1691
01:43:30.661 --> 01:43:35.310
character.
You could make that into a little drill,
right?
Actually,
look,

1692
01:43:35.311 --> 01:43:38.580
actually go down that list of characteristics and say,
which where are you at?

1693
01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:43.500
Yeah.
To recognize your weak points and make an effort to overcome them.
Three,

1694
01:43:43.501 --> 01:43:44.820
solicit when appropriate.

1695
01:43:44.821 --> 01:43:48.480
That candid opinions of others as to how you can make the most of your desirable

1696
01:43:48.481 --> 01:43:50.700
qualities and eliminate your undesirable ones.
Be.

1697
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.990
Because when you asked that question,
if you ask it honestly,

1698
01:43:53.991 --> 01:43:57.140
you're going to get some answers.
You don't want to hear what your weak points.

1699
01:43:57.170 --> 01:44:01.070
Yeah.
No one wants to hear about those.
We do not even from themselves,

1700
01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:03.080
from themselves.
And it's,

1701
01:44:03.110 --> 01:44:08.110
it's so rare that someone truly wants to hear what they screwed up.

1702
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:12.610
It's,
it just doesn't hardly exist.
Yeah.
So,

1703
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:17.300
so what that means is everyone knows that and since everyone knows that they are

1704
01:44:17.301 --> 01:44:21.020
not going to give you an honest feedback.
So when you say,
hey,

1705
01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:24.410
how'd I do on that last task?
They go,
Oh man,
you did good.
They're lying.

1706
01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.990
They're not even being tactful.
They're lying.
They're telling a lie.

1707
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:32.060
They're telling a lie to you.
Cause if they,
if they wanted to be tactful,

1708
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:34.100
they gets to be tactful and say,
Hey,
you know what?

1709
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.920
I know it was a tough project and you pulled it off,
which was commendable.

1710
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.370
But there were some definite areas for improvement.
And he know what,

1711
01:44:43.371 --> 01:44:47.090
luckily I kept a list.
Let's go through it.
Boom.

1712
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:53.800
Next profit by studying the causes for past success or failure of other leaders,

1713
01:44:54.951 --> 01:44:59.910
past and present.
Develop a genuine interest in people.

1714
01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:02.970
Acquire the human touch.
Practice the golden rule.

1715
01:45:03.210 --> 01:45:05.940
Mastered the art of good writing and speaking.

1716
01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:08.643
How do you do that?

1717
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:13.280
Write and speak and read and listen.

1718
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:15.051
And last one,

1719
01:45:15.051 --> 01:45:20.051
cultivate cordial relations with members of other arms and services and with

1720
01:45:20.421 --> 01:45:24.110
civilians.
Cool.
That's how you get to know yourself.

1721
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:28.670
Some things,
some techniques for knowing your knowing your men.
Principle three,

1722
01:45:28.671 --> 01:45:31.400
know your men and look out for their welfare.
Number one,

1723
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:34.220
see the members of your command and let them see you.

1724
01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.980
Stay locked up in the ivory tower.

1725
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:44.000
Be Friendly and approachable.
Approachable,
yeah.
Important,
important.

1726
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.630
Develop an intimate knowledge and understanding of your subordinates through

1727
01:45:47.631 --> 01:45:50.480
personal contact and available records and small commands.

1728
01:45:50.481 --> 01:45:54.170
It is imperative not only that the leader know the name and address of his

1729
01:45:54.171 --> 01:45:55.004
subordinates,

1730
01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:58.640
but also that he's familiar with their characteristic characteristics.
Cool.
No.

1731
01:45:58.641 --> 01:46:00.980
Your people literally know your people.

1732
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:04.790
Interest yourself and living conditions of the members of your command,

1733
01:46:04.791 --> 01:46:07.010
including their family environment,
food,
clothing,
ability.

1734
01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.340
Make ample provision for and give personal invisible attention to the various

1735
01:46:12.341 --> 01:46:13.210
personal services,

1736
01:46:13.211 --> 01:46:16.900
particularly those concerned with the personal problems of individuals.

1737
01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.710
Provide for the spiritual welfare of your command by supporting religious

1738
01:46:20.711 --> 01:46:21.400
activities.

1739
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.210
Protect the health of your command by active supervision of hygiene and

1740
01:46:25.211 --> 01:46:28.510
sanitation.
Support actively a safety program.

1741
01:46:28.630 --> 01:46:32.080
Determine the mental attitude of members of your command by frequent informal

1742
01:46:32.081 --> 01:46:36.520
visits and by using fully and fully all available sources of information

1743
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:43.330
administered justice in partially to all without fear of favor.

1744
01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.010
When punishment is necessary,
the commander should be fair,

1745
01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:50.640
consistent and impersonal.

1746
01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:55.290
<v 2>Punish in private,
private with dignity and with human understanding,</v>

1747
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:58.290
never awarded degrading punishment.

1748
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:02.880
Avoid punishing a group for the faults of the individual.

1749
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.620
Always make the individual feel that the punishment is temporary and that

1750
01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:12.621
improvement is expected and I think when he says expected or that when they say

1751
01:47:12.691 --> 01:47:16.230
expected,
I don't think they're talking about like,
Hey,
I expect you to do better.

1752
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:18.090
It's more like,
hey man,

1753
01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:22.110
like I know you can do better because that's what they're talking about.

1754
01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.350
And it's an interesting one.

1755
01:47:23.351 --> 01:47:26.210
The avoid punishing a group for the fault of the individual because the military

1756
01:47:26.211 --> 01:47:27.060
is famous for doing that,

1757
01:47:27.061 --> 01:47:32.010
especially in like bootcamp scenarios where we're going to keep doing these

1758
01:47:32.011 --> 01:47:35.130
until we can all do them in unison,
whatever jumping jacks.

1759
01:47:35.131 --> 01:47:39.960
But beyond those scenarios,
that's a,
that's not always the best call to make.

1760
01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.980
Yeah,
because that's like,
it's one of those,

1761
01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:47.230
in football they'd do that to real like obvious.
Like I like you,

1762
01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:51.330
if you mess up everyone else does the bell from bear crawls and you stand and

1763
01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:56.331
watch a psychological punishment to the guy more than the team.

1764
01:47:56.581 --> 01:47:59.690
Yeah.
So it's like,
it's like a different approach,
but you know,

1765
01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:03.230
I get it for that very reason.
By the way I it,

1766
01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:07.800
it works in the bootcamp environment where the or the team training environment

1767
01:48:07.801 --> 01:48:12.801
where you're trying to create this overall cohesion by making everyone rely on

1768
01:48:16.981 --> 01:48:21.981
each other and be able to count on each other as if to say in a demonstrated

1769
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:24.450
way,
like when you mess up,

1770
01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:28.530
this affects the team and put the peer pressure on everyone to step up their

1771
01:48:28.531 --> 01:48:33.060
game.
Right.
If we don't make this time,
if everyone doesn't make this time,

1772
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:36.360
then we're all gonna get punished.
Okay.
So we don't want that on our backs.

1773
01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.970
But when you get into a business situation,

1774
01:48:38.971 --> 01:48:42.450
you start punishing people for the group failure.
That's,

1775
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.130
that's not as effective in building in fact what they're going do.

1776
01:48:47.131 --> 01:48:48.750
Sometimes it starts ripping things apart.

1777
01:48:48.930 --> 01:48:53.400
They're going to be careful with that one.
Haiti.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,

1778
01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:54.293
next.

1779
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:58.340
Ensure fair and equitable distribution of privileges such as past as leads and

1780
01:48:58.341 --> 01:48:59.250
rotation and courage,

1781
01:48:59.251 --> 01:49:02.520
educational development by providing educational opportunities for members of

1782
01:49:02.521 --> 01:49:03.354
your command.

1783
01:49:04.890 --> 01:49:09.510
I often ask groups this,
leaders in companies,

1784
01:49:09.511 --> 01:49:10.260
I'll say,

1785
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:15.260
who here had someone that truly took a vested interest in you and helped you

1786
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:22.260
move up the ranks through the chain of command in your industry?

1787
01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:26.210
And everyone will raise their hand just about,
you know,

1788
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:30.480
99% of people raise their hand and I'll say,
how good did that feel?

1789
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:34.140
One to 10,
to have someone that was completely invested in helping you.

1790
01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:37.980
Uh,
who's,
who's a nine or above,
everyone raises their hand.

1791
01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:40.830
Imagine how good that feels when you do that.

1792
01:49:40.831 --> 01:49:45.831
For someone else because it's real easy to forget that someone helped you.

1793
01:49:46.801 --> 01:49:48.190
It's easy to forget

1794
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:53.050
<v 1>that you got hoisted up to your position of power by other people that were</v>

1795
01:49:53.051 --> 01:49:57.250
willing to sacrifice their time and their energy to improve your lot in life.

1796
01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:00.970
So when you get the opportunity to improve someone else's lot in life,
do it.

1797
01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:02.073
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

1798
01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:06.870
<v 1>Next techniques for keeping your men informed,</v>

1799
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:13.420
explained to your principal subordinates why any particular task must be

1800
01:50:13.421 --> 01:50:17.620
accomplished and how you propose to do it.
So importance of understanding why.

1801
01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:22.330
Assure yourself by frequent inspections and visits that subordinates are

1802
01:50:22.331 --> 01:50:24.760
transmitting necessary information to the men.

1803
01:50:25.730 --> 01:50:26.140
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1804
01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:28.630
<v 1>so you just can't expect it.
You got an inspected.</v>

1805
01:50:29.230 --> 01:50:32.500
Keep your principal subordinates informed of plans for future operations.

1806
01:50:32.501 --> 01:50:34.480
Subject only to security restrictions.

1807
01:50:34.481 --> 01:50:38.020
Disseminate information concerning the capabilities of our weapons compared to

1808
01:50:38.021 --> 01:50:42.850
those of an active or potential enemy,
where an enemy has an initial advantage.

1809
01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:44.620
Show how this can be overcome.

1810
01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:48.310
Be sure the troops are informed of the capabilities and limitations of

1811
01:50:48.311 --> 01:50:50.860
supporting units,
arms and services.

1812
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:54.340
Be alert to detect the spread of false rumors.

1813
01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:58.140
Stop rumors by replacing them with

1814
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.930
<v 0>the truth.</v>

1815
01:51:01.150 --> 01:51:04.990
<v 1>Build confidence in a spree decor by exploiting all information concerning</v>

1816
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.840
success,
successes of the command.
That's,
that's a big one,

1817
01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:11.440
is a lot of times businesses,
companies,
people,
they do things.

1818
01:51:11.441 --> 01:51:14.320
Things go well and they don't tell anybody about it and it gets lost.

1819
01:51:14.321 --> 01:51:17.410
Whereas if you want to build morale and you want to get momentum,

1820
01:51:17.530 --> 01:51:19.600
you've got to tell everyone,
hey,
we're out here and we're crushing it.

1821
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:20.803
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

1822
01:51:22.290 --> 01:51:27.290
<v 1>Principle five how to set the example,
number one,</v>

1823
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:31.670
be at all times physically fit,
mentally alert,
well-groomed,

1824
01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.200
and correctly dressed.

1825
01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:35.953
<v 0>There you go.</v>

1826
01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:41.420
<v 1>That's how you set the example to master your emotions.</v>

1827
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:47.300
The commander who is subject to intemperate bursts of anger or to periods of

1828
01:51:47.301 --> 01:51:51.650
depression will have difficulty in gaining and holding respect and loyalty of

1829
01:51:51.651 --> 01:51:54.820
his subordinates.
So true.
Hm.

1830
01:51:56.420 --> 01:52:01.070
Maintain an optimistic outlook.
The will to win is infectious.

1831
01:52:01.071 --> 01:52:03.590
The leader fosters it by capitalizing on his units,

1832
01:52:03.591 --> 01:52:07.370
capabilities and success is not on his limitations or failures.

1833
01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:10.280
Maintain an air of outward calmness.

1834
01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:14.360
The more difficult the situation,
the more important this becomes.

1835
01:52:14.361 --> 01:52:17.450
So when things start going sideways,
you gotta stay calm.

1836
01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:24.490
Conduct herself so that your personal habits are not open to censure course

1837
01:52:24.491 --> 01:52:29.140
behavior and vulgarity are the marks of an essentially and unstable character.

1838
01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:34.900
These together with a failure to be punctual and a tendency towards selfishness

1839
01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:40.110
and self indulgence in luxuries not available to the command in general are

1840
01:52:40.181 --> 01:52:44.140
inevitably resented by all ranks.
So that's what we were just talking about.

1841
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:47.420
But yeah,
man,
you to hold yourself to a little higher standard,

1842
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:51.770
maybe even a lot higher standard because they're watching you

1843
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:56.690
cooperate in spirit as well as in fact,

1844
01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.740
this is what I just talked about and what we just talked about.
It's not just,

1845
01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:05.240
hey,
I'm pretending to do this cause it's gonna make things easier for me.
It's,

1846
01:53:05.241 --> 01:53:09.920
I truly am doing this cooperation must work in two directions.

1847
01:53:09.921 --> 01:53:14.600
It arises from a whole hearted desire by all members to further the effective

1848
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:16.190
operations of the team

1849
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:23.450
exercise initiative and promote this spirit of initiative in your subordinates.

1850
01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:29.420
Be conspicuously loyal to those below you as well as those above you support

1851
01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:30.290
those under you.

1852
01:53:30.291 --> 01:53:34.580
As long as the individuals concerned have been discharging their duties

1853
01:53:34.581 --> 01:53:37.880
competently.
The commander who seeks,
however,

1854
01:53:37.881 --> 01:53:42.500
to protect an incompetent subordinate from correction by a higher commander is

1855
01:53:42.501 --> 01:53:44.330
being disloyal himself.

1856
01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:49.600
Loyalty is a prime trait of leadership and demands unqualified support of the

1857
01:53:50.001 --> 01:53:51.800
policies of the superior officers.

1858
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.350
Whether the individual concerned personally favors them or not.

1859
01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:57.800
That's the whole conversation we just had about loyalty.

1860
01:54:00.150 --> 01:54:03.210
Avoid the development of a click of favorites.

1861
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:05.970
While it is difficult to avoid,

1862
01:54:06.330 --> 01:54:08.820
I liked this one cause they readily admit this is interesting,

1863
01:54:09.150 --> 01:54:11.160
so avoid the development of a click of favorites,

1864
01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.410
but then they kind of throw this on there.

1865
01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:17.430
While it is difficult to avoid being partial to subordinates who have rendered

1866
01:54:17.431 --> 01:54:19.650
loyal and superior service over a period of time,

1867
01:54:19.651 --> 01:54:24.510
that's a temptation to show partiality should be vigorously resisted.

1868
01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:25.171
So they're saying,

1869
01:54:25.171 --> 01:54:27.630
I guess this can be hard because you've got somebody on your team that's just

1870
01:54:27.631 --> 01:54:31.980
doing great things natural.
Yeah,
I always had a hard time with that.
Yeah,

1871
01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.330
makes sense.
I wouldn't be overt about it,
but if you were doing good,

1872
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:41.070
you were going to get some,
some Benny's from,
yeah.

1873
01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.460
Be Morally courageous.

1874
01:54:44.461 --> 01:54:47.640
The commander who fails to stand by his principles where the welfare of his

1875
01:54:47.641 --> 01:54:52.200
command is concerned or who attempts to avoid responsibility for mistakes of his

1876
01:54:52.201 --> 01:54:56.760
command will fail to gain or hold respect of his associates or subordinates.

1877
01:54:58.410 --> 01:55:01.860
And the last one,
share danger and hardship.

1878
01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:06.660
A leader who has elements of his command subjected to danger or to hardship of

1879
01:55:06.661 --> 01:55:07.171
any kind,

1880
01:55:07.171 --> 01:55:11.250
should visit them as often as possible to demonstrate without Austin station

1881
01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:16.140
that his willingness to assume his share of the difficulties.

1882
01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:21.710
So those are some techniques for that principle six,

1883
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:25.220
how do we ensure that the task is understood,
supervised and accomplished?

1884
01:55:25.221 --> 01:55:28.010
Here are some techniques for that through study and practice.

1885
01:55:28.011 --> 01:55:31.610
Develop the ability to think clearly,
to issue a clear,
concise,
positive order.

1886
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:37.170
Isn't it strange that I ended up using the word simple,
clear,
concise,

1887
01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:41.940
and they use the word,
I guess it's not that weird,
but it's,
it's funny to see,

1888
01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:47.610
to encourage subordinates to seek immediate clarification about any point in

1889
01:55:47.611 --> 01:55:50.370
your orders or directors that they do not understand perfectly.

1890
01:55:50.371 --> 01:55:55.371
So that's something that so many people fail to do is everyone just keeps their

1891
01:55:55.501 --> 01:55:58.410
mouth shut.
No,
I don't have any questions.
It's so funny.

1892
01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:03.570
<v 3>These,
and this one really is,
seems so obvious,
like,
oh yeah,</v>

1893
01:56:03.571 --> 01:56:06.210
you're not clear.
Like,
oh,
what do you do if you're not clear?

1894
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:09.990
It's this big mystery what to do.
Everyone knows.
Even if you're a kid,
you know,

1895
01:56:09.991 --> 01:56:12.600
like,
oh,
I didn't understand that.
Like what do you mean?
What do you mean?
Why?

1896
01:56:12.601 --> 01:56:15.690
Why he and the kids always ask why?
Why do I live?
Same thing.

1897
01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:18.840
So it seems super obvious,
but yeah,
when you're in there,

1898
01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.130
you want to keep your mouth shut.
There's all these different human,
yeah,

1899
01:56:23.131 --> 01:56:26.040
you don't want to look stupid.
You don't want to open,
you know,

1900
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:28.650
<v 1>you don't want to be that guy.
I</v>

1901
01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:35.800
question your subordinates and assistance to determine if there's any doubt or

1902
01:56:35.811 --> 01:56:39.380
misunderstanding to the task.
So this is something that we always say.

1903
01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.290
How do you know people understand?
You ask them and you just don't ask them.

1904
01:56:42.291 --> 01:56:43.970
Do you understand?
You're asking me to explain it back to you.

1905
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:49.640
Make every means available to your subordinates to assist them in accomplishing

1906
01:56:49.641 --> 01:56:54.480
their mission.
Principle seven train your men as a team.

1907
01:56:54.481 --> 01:56:57.690
Ensure by inspections and training tests that your command is being trained in

1908
01:56:57.691 --> 01:57:01.710
accordance with the training programs and doctrine prescribed by higher

1909
01:57:01.711 --> 01:57:02.544
authority.

1910
01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:06.750
Make sure the best available facilities for team training are provided.

1911
01:57:07.110 --> 01:57:09.150
Ensure that all trading is purposeful.

1912
01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:13.080
Ensure that each element of the command is acquainted with the capabilities and

1913
01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:15.000
limitations of all other elements,

1914
01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:18.690
thereby developing mutual trust and understanding.

1915
01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:20.080
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1916
01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:24.130
<v 1>ensure each subordinate leader understands the mechanics of tactical control for</v>

1917
01:57:24.131 --> 01:57:25.600
his own echelon of command.

1918
01:57:25.810 --> 01:57:29.050
Predicate team training on modern realistic conditions.

1919
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:35.970
Insist that each officer and enlisted man knows the functions of each other.

1920
01:57:35.971 --> 01:57:39.960
Officer and enlisted man with whom he habitually operates.

1921
01:57:40.650 --> 01:57:44.550
Insist that each of these no one understand each other,
their traits,
peculiarity,

1922
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:46.800
strengths and weaknesses.
So often in companies,

1923
01:57:46.801 --> 01:57:51.420
this is not happening in businesses.
It happens pretty well in the military,

1924
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:54.030
but in businesses you'll have departments.

1925
01:57:54.031 --> 01:57:57.510
They've no idea what another department does.
No idea how they do their job,

1926
01:57:57.511 --> 01:57:59.550
no idea what their job even entails.

1927
01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.180
Lafe and I used to make tea,

1928
01:58:03.210 --> 01:58:08.210
make teams brief what their department did and when we get them in there in the

1929
01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:12.740
room,
you'd see people would just had no idea what the other teams were doing.

1930
01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:14.950
They'd be like,
oh,
I didn't know you guys did that.
Hello,

1931
01:58:14.970 --> 01:58:16.680
you guys been doing that for nine years.

1932
01:58:19.890 --> 01:58:24.060
Demand the highest standard of discipline and teamwork in all training.

1933
01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:28.530
We support that.
Seize opportunities to train with other units,

1934
01:58:28.531 --> 01:58:30.330
both combat and service.

1935
01:58:31.410 --> 01:58:35.940
Principle eight make sound and timely decisions.
This first one here,

1936
01:58:35.941 --> 01:58:36.870
these are techniques again,

1937
01:58:38.610 --> 01:58:43.610
develop a logical and orderly thought by constant practice in making objective

1938
01:58:44.351 --> 01:58:45.700
estimates of the situation.

1939
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.960
Making an estimate is not restricted to the military to employ.

1940
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.770
It is employed in everyday life of all persons.
So how do you make decisions?

1941
01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:58.750
How do you do that?
What and then you come up with is kind of a process that you,

1942
01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:04.000
you flow through in your brain off to add that to the protocol book,

1943
01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:09.360
how to make decisions and so far as time and occasion permit plan for every

1944
01:59:10.571 --> 01:59:13.150
contingency that can reasonably be foreseen.

1945
01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:18.010
Consider the advice and suggestions of your subordinates before making your

1946
01:59:18.011 --> 01:59:18.491
decisions.

1947
01:59:18.491 --> 01:59:23.080
Of course announced decisions in time to allow subordinates to make necessary

1948
01:59:23.081 --> 01:59:23.914
plans.
Boom.

1949
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:29.680
Principle nine is seek responsibility and develop a sense of responsibility

1950
01:59:29.681 --> 01:59:32.770
among risk subordinates.
So this one says,

1951
01:59:32.890 --> 01:59:36.130
learn the duties and responsibility of your immune immediate supervisor.

1952
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:39.970
I actually think you learn your immediate supervisor and his boss.

1953
01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.920
You want to at least know what's going on.

1954
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:46.000
Seek diversified assignments which will give you responsibility and command

1955
01:59:46.001 --> 01:59:48.260
experience.
People always want to stay and we'll do,

1956
01:59:48.261 --> 01:59:49.420
we'll keep doing what they're good at.

1957
01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:52.450
They don't want to venture out into the different world.

1958
01:59:53.170 --> 01:59:57.460
Take advantage of any opportunity which offers increased responsibility.
Do that.

1959
01:59:58.330 --> 02:00:01.000
Oh,
this is a task that needs to be done.
Someone needs running.
I got it.

1960
02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:02.373
I'm on it.

1961
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:09.010
Perform every task larger,
small to the best of your ability.

1962
02:00:10.090 --> 02:00:12.280
And this goes back to whatever,

1963
02:00:12.281 --> 02:00:16.630
a few podcasts ago we were talking about how you do anything is how you do

1964
02:00:16.631 --> 02:00:19.990
everything.
And I gave some slack on that one,

1965
02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:24.130
but these guys got no slack at all.
Perform every task larger,

1966
02:00:24.131 --> 02:00:25.330
small to the best of your ability.

1967
02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:30.730
Your reward will consist of increased opportunity to demonstrate your fitness to

1968
02:00:30.731 --> 02:00:34.390
perform bigger and more important tasks.
What does that mean?

1969
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:37.720
The better you do,
the more work you're going to get.
That's what it means.

1970
02:00:40.150 --> 02:00:44.740
Oh,
tell your subordinates what to do,
not how to do it.

1971
02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:49.300
Hold them responsible for the results.
Delegate and supervise,

1972
02:00:49.301 --> 02:00:52.240
but do not intervene except when urgently necessary.

1973
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:57.430
Avoid usurping the prerogatives of your subordinates.

1974
02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:01.300
This is actually such a concise,

1975
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:06.220
clear rule.
Tell your subordinates what to do,

1976
02:01:06.250 --> 02:01:09.760
not how to do it.
Hold them responsible for the results.

1977
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Delegate and supervise but do not intervene except when urgently necessary.

1978
02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:20.230
Avoid usurping the prerogatives of your subordinates.

1979
02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:24.310
That is really good advice for anyone in a leadership position.

1980
02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.170
If you could follow that advice right there,

1981
02:01:26.171 --> 02:01:27.940
your world is going to be so much better.

1982
02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:33.310
Provide all personnel with frequent opportunities to perform duties of the next

1983
02:01:33.311 --> 02:01:34.840
higher echelon.
Yes.

1984
02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:39.530
T bruiser we made all the junior officers be ground force commander before we

1985
02:01:39.531 --> 02:01:42.390
went overseas kind of experience and then they went overseas.

1986
02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.760
And did it be quick to recognize accomplishments of your subordinates when they

1987
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:49.190
demonstrate initiative and resourcefulness.
Correct.

1988
02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:53.120
Errors in the use of judgment and initiative in such a way as to encourage the

1989
02:01:53.121 --> 02:01:53.954
individual.

1990
02:01:54.270 --> 02:01:54.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1991
02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:56.950
<v 1>Avoid public criticism or condemnation.</v>

1992
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1993
02:01:58.610 --> 02:02:03.020
<v 1>Be Liberal.
However,
openly giving praise for which is which is deserved.</v>

1994
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:08.890
Give unstintingly help give unstintingly of help and advice when you are

1995
02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:13.850
requested by those under your command,
that one's pretty obvious.

1996
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:18.500
Ensure that your personnel are assigned positions commensurate with demonstrated

1997
02:02:18.501 --> 02:02:22.510
or potential ability.
That's important.
Get someone that's got some potential,

1998
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:23.510
put them in a good spot.

1999
02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:26.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2000
02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:29.670
<v 1>Be Prompt and fair and backing subordinates to the limit</v>

2001
02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.430
until convinced otherwise have faith in each subordinate.

2002
02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:36.850
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2003
02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:40.630
<v 1>I think you got to take a little time to make sure you build that up is don't</v>

2004
02:02:40.631 --> 02:02:44.710
dive in with complete faith and give a little task first.

2005
02:02:45.190 --> 02:02:48.040
Demonstrate to your command that you are ready and willing to accept

2006
02:02:48.041 --> 02:02:50.290
responsibility.
Yes.
I want our ship

2007
02:02:53.850 --> 02:02:57.180
principle 10 techniques on how to employ

2008
02:02:58.830 --> 02:03:02.070
your command in accordance with its capabilities.
Number one,

2009
02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:05.790
no understand and apply the principles of war

2010
02:03:07.650 --> 02:03:10.380
and those principles of war of different than what we're talking about right
now.

2011
02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:15.870
The principles of war that they're talking about,
our objective offense,

2012
02:03:16.050 --> 02:03:20.160
mass,
economy of force,
maneuver,
unity of command,
security,

2013
02:03:20.161 --> 02:03:23.760
surprise and simplicity.
Those are the

2014
02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:25.170
<v 0>okay</v>

2015
02:03:25.170 --> 02:03:29.340
<v 1>principles of war that they're talking about.
So you got to know those,</v>

2016
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:32.160
so that means in your company you got to understand the principles that you're

2017
02:03:32.161 --> 02:03:32.994
operating in.

2018
02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:40.580
Keep yourself informed as to the relative operational effectiveness of various

2019
02:03:41.191 --> 02:03:42.450
elements of your command.

2020
02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.400
Be sure the tasks assigned are reasonably possible of accomplishment.

2021
02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.390
Analyze any tasks assigned.
If it means you're disposable,

2022
02:03:51.570 --> 02:03:54.330
if means that your disposable appear inadequate of form,

2023
02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:58.710
inform your media commander and request additional means.
Yeah.
It's not like,
oh,

2024
02:03:58.711 --> 02:04:02.130
I'll get anything done,
boss.
I can do anything.
It's like,
no,

2025
02:04:02.131 --> 02:04:04.200
actually I'm going to need some more support over here and we need some more

2026
02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:06.060
people,
money,
resources,
whatever.

2027
02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:11.970
Make every effort to equalize tasks proportionally over appropriate periods of

2028
02:04:11.971 --> 02:04:16.250
time.
Among the several elements of your command.
No,

2029
02:04:16.251 --> 02:04:19.470
don't just ladened down one group.

2030
02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.250
If you've got one group that's so much stronger than the other group moves and

2031
02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:27.300
people around,
she gets him a equality there.

2032
02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:30.300
And here's the last principal techniques.

2033
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:34.550
Take responsibility for your actions.
Principal 11

2034
02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.040
extreme ownership.
Remember that you are

2035
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:43.040
<v 2>responsible for all your command does or fails to do except justified criticism.</v>

2036
02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:49.960
Adhere to what you think is right and have courage of your convictions.

2037
02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:57.540
So
those are some,
uh,
some heavy hitters.

2038
02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:02.250
What this book does now,
and I'm not going to do it,

2039
02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:06.360
is it actually breaks down how the,

2040
02:05:06.361 --> 02:05:10.140
what different leadership techniques you can use at every level.

2041
02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:15.690
So it talks about,
and you know what,
I haven't said this yet.
This book is free.

2042
02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:19.170
This is online.
You can Google 1951.

2043
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:24.030
Leadership Fm 10,
tack 22.
Was it a,
uh,

2044
02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:28.530
like a pdf?
Yeah,
that's like a pdf.
And so you can,

2045
02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:30.690
you can look it up and you can figure out where you are.

2046
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:34.200
It talks about technique useful to noncommissioned officers.

2047
02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.890
It talks about techniques for,
um,

2048
02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:41.220
regimental and lower unit commanders.

2049
02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:46.250
It talks about commanders of divisions and higher units and it goes through what

2050
02:05:46.681 --> 02:05:49.500
kind of techniques you can use in each one of these positions.

2051
02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:53.220
And they're all solid information,

2052
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:57.240
solid information and points out good.

2053
02:05:57.390 --> 02:06:00.540
Not just what the rules are about the techniques that are used to,

2054
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:03.540
to kind of make them happen

2055
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:10.310
and so solid a bunch of information there that again,

2056
02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:14.400
you can easily give us.
This book is a pretty short read.

2057
02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:15.870
I've read a bunch of it right now.

2058
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:20.700
I mean I actually kind of went crazy with my red with my red pen,

2059
02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:25.920
just circling everything and saying,
hey,
read this too.
But

2060
02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.320
there's a ton of it in here,
but I'm going to skip back to,
um,

2061
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:35.160
there's skip that information and look it up.
Go read it.
It's powerful stuff.

2062
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:38.700
And I'm gonna Kinda just jump ahead to this last little closing part that I

2063
02:06:38.701 --> 02:06:39.534
wanted to cover,

2064
02:06:39.810 --> 02:06:44.810
which is talking about how to train and it just talks about a few things.

2065
02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:49.800
Stress,
realism because we have to make training realistic.

2066
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:53.700
That's what we have to do.
It's what I did when I was in the seal teams.

2067
02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:57.360
It's what you should do in whatever kind of organization you're in.

2068
02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:00.350
If you're an a,
if you're in a business,
you should send me that.

2069
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:04.290
Make your training as close to real as you possibly can.

2070
02:07:05.490 --> 02:07:10.490
Another thing is require repeated drills in the execution of simple tactical

2071
02:07:10.951 --> 02:07:13.740
maneuvers.
What does that mean?
Repetition counts.

2072
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:18.510
You have to repeat things over and over again if you want to get good at them.

2073
02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:23.670
Another important training tips,
stress the importance of each leader,

2074
02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:28.700
so placing himself and his headquarters that he can most readily coordinate all

2075
02:07:29.671 --> 02:07:33.180
efforts of his command and of the elements that may be supporting it.

2076
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:36.340
Where you're located is important,

2077
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:39.850
where you position yourself is important.

2078
02:07:40.450 --> 02:07:43.690
And so you've got to recognize that that's going to change depending on the

2079
02:07:43.691 --> 02:07:44.950
situation.
You've got to learn how to,

2080
02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:50.340
how to address that and how to pick the right spot to be in.

2081
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:54.310
And the last one is last couple of stress.

2082
02:07:54.311 --> 02:07:58.030
The importance of exchange of information by all appropriate means.

2083
02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:03.930
So we got to communicate and the last one is have a well planned critique

2084
02:08:05.590 --> 02:08:09.550
immediately after each field exercise.

2085
02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:14.410
And that again wraps up this very,

2086
02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:21.460
very powerful summation.
Very simple,
very straightforward.

2087
02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:27.190
Um,
I feel like I actually could have talked about each one of these points

2088
02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:33.490
and going over examples that goes,
he's one of them is so important.

2089
02:08:33.670 --> 02:08:35.740
Yeah.
So I don't know,

2090
02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:39.280
maybe we'll do it again or they'll come up again.

2091
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:42.010
But that's what you have.

2092
02:08:42.070 --> 02:08:47.020
And then just that closing point on having a well planned critique after every

2093
02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:49.330
field exercises,
what does that actually mean?

2094
02:08:49.331 --> 02:08:51.880
What that means is always be learning,

2095
02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:55.270
always be learning.
And

2096
02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.380
almost every one of these principles I recognized,
I have heard before,

2097
02:09:02.381 --> 02:09:05.050
I've definitely read them before.
We've covered them here before,

2098
02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:07.870
but I'm still trying to learn,

2099
02:09:07.930 --> 02:09:12.930
I'm trying to still trying to relearn even the same lessons after years of me

2100
02:09:15.311 --> 02:09:17.020
looking at this stuff,
which

2101
02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:21.700
I guess is me just kind of following the principles of themselves,

2102
02:09:21.701 --> 02:09:23.740
which is know your job,
know yourself and seek improvements.

2103
02:09:23.741 --> 02:09:24.760
That's what I'm trying to do.

2104
02:09:24.761 --> 02:09:29.260
And I think that's pretty much what anyone that's listening to this is trying to

2105
02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:33.430
do.
So,
I mean,
I guess Echo,

2106
02:09:33.431 --> 02:09:35.050
speaking of rule number two,

2107
02:09:36.250 --> 02:09:40.720
and speaking of us seeking to constantly improve ourselves,

2108
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.000
what do you know about things that can help us improve our situation?

2109
02:09:49.630 --> 02:09:54.630
Support what we're trying to do in our self improvement journey.

2110
02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:58.180
Journey.
Sure.
Path,
path,
big time.

2111
02:09:58.870 --> 02:10:01.810
And actually you can support this podcast if they wish.

2112
02:10:02.010 --> 02:10:07.010
If you want to while you support your own journey down the path.

2113
02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:12.070
Yes.
Of discipline.

2114
02:10:12.130 --> 02:10:17.130
And keep in mind this path that we are on also brings along others.

2115
02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.770
Even if they're not like on the path with you,

2116
02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.090
your results of being on the path improve them as well.

2117
02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:30.490
I found that out directly.
How many capacities?
Okay,
so let's say,

2118
02:10:30.491 --> 02:10:33.350
you know that sounded like one of those statements that you make where you're

2119
02:10:33.351 --> 02:10:34.250
just wanting a prompt

2120
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.980
<v 3>so you can tell a long story.
Yes,
that's what it sounded like.</v>

2121
02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:39.840
You were ready as he said.
How'd you find out a youth bubble?

2122
02:10:40.230 --> 02:10:43.400
You're not eating well.

2123
02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:48.980
So Ian,
Ian,
a family household in a group setting or whatever,
right?

2124
02:10:48.981 --> 02:10:52.430
Things can get stressful.
I'm not saying they're stressful every single day,

2125
02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:56.340
every moment,
but they can get stressful.
Right.
So,
you know,
like any,
you know,

2126
02:10:56.341 --> 02:10:59.500
you know about stressful situations,
I'm assuming a little bit.
Yeah.

2127
02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:03.680
So when everyone's panicking or whatever,

2128
02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:09.800
stressed out or whatever,
and you get one guy who jumps in there,

2129
02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:14.910
the situation,
not panicking,
not overtly,
uh,

2130
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:19.520
stressed out and he,
he can sort of manage not only himself,

2131
02:11:19.521 --> 02:11:22.490
but his tiny environment.
It's contagious.

2132
02:11:22.491 --> 02:11:24.950
Other people will get that and they start doing that as well,

2133
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:28.100
whether it be in the immediate situation or just in general.

2134
02:11:28.101 --> 02:11:31.610
We just covered this is part of the book,
right?
Yeah.
Big Time.
How that leads,

2135
02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:32.091
first of all,

2136
02:11:32.091 --> 02:11:37.091
the leader can come from any rank and then when they step in that leadership and

2137
02:11:37.551 --> 02:11:42.220
the way that they act will spread throughout his team.
Oh yeah.

2138
02:11:42.290 --> 02:11:46.970
So you're confirming.
Yes.
Big Time.
And that goes for like us big time,

2139
02:11:46.971 --> 02:11:50.900
but huge,
huge,
huge day.
And so it's the soul,

2140
02:11:50.901 --> 02:11:53.270
if you're getting in shape,
right?

2141
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:57.260
The people around you will sort of notice if you're like happier,

2142
02:11:57.380 --> 02:12:01.010
doing things more,
make getting more done around you,
you know,

2143
02:12:01.011 --> 02:12:05.480
taking responsibility for things.
You're taking out the trash,

2144
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:08.690
every other nightmare for whenever it fills up.
I don't know when I,

2145
02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:11.000
it depends on how big your trashes I guess,

2146
02:12:11.001 --> 02:12:14.780
but if you're taking it out when it's full,

2147
02:12:14.781 --> 02:12:17.990
you don't let it overflow anymore.
People notice that.

2148
02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:23.700
I'm just saying and slowly by slowly,
especially if you're happier,
you know,

2149
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:27.290
if you're treating them better and all this stuff,
they'll start doing it too.

2150
02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:31.730
Same thing with extreme ownership.
You know how like,
um,
you know,
if you,

2151
02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:35.420
if you come at a problem like,
hey,
that was my fault it most of the time,

2152
02:12:35.421 --> 02:12:38.880
eventually,
if not immediately they'll say,
well,
you know what,
it's kind of my,

2153
02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:41.090
yeah,
same exact thing.

2154
02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:46.120
So that's why you should be on the path and stay on the path because you're not

2155
02:12:46.371 --> 02:12:49.260
just helping yourself.
You're helping everyone around you.
Sir,

2156
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:54.290
you are one of those things that you're doing on top of taking out the trash

2157
02:12:54.291 --> 02:12:59.080
when it needs to be taken out.
His Jujitsu?
No,
here's that's a,

2158
02:12:59.081 --> 02:13:02.200
it's kind of you.
Just this one of these ones where people might not.
Right.

2159
02:13:02.210 --> 02:13:05.870
Especially if you're a husband,
you want to do Jujitsu now,
but wait,

2160
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:10.340
we have a family of six or more whatever or less,
I don't know.

2161
02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:12.050
And you have responsibilities in there.

2162
02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:17.050
Now you want to add this quote unquote extra curricular activity to these tasks.

2163
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:19.670
That's what you're telling them,
right?
That's the situation.
Right.

2164
02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:24.410
But like I said,
one,
you get the benefits of Jujitsu and you come home,

2165
02:13:24.411 --> 02:13:28.820
you slowly become a different person,
a better person,
a better person,

2166
02:13:30.250 --> 02:13:32.820
a better person in household is a better situation.

2167
02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:34.470
So for everyone in the household,

2168
02:13:34.690 --> 02:13:38.880
everybody and the neighbors and the neighborhood,
your whole street,

2169
02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:44.010
the whole town,
the whole world.
It's better.
Yes sir.
It is.

2170
02:13:44.250 --> 02:13:47.550
And when you do Jujitsu,
you will need a geek and a rash guard.

2171
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:52.080
At least one I think.
Yeah.
What are the best guys in the whole wide world?

2172
02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:54.600
They are origin,
geese,
geese by far.

2173
02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:59.100
And they are made in America 100% sometimes people actually not about the keys,

2174
02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:01.560
but people still ask me,
you know,
some people will be like,

2175
02:14:01.561 --> 02:14:05.010
they don't like they started training and they don't like it.
Don't like,

2176
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:07.600
Oh did you do
it?

2177
02:14:08.630 --> 02:14:12.690
Some people realize immediately like they get submitted and they're like,

2178
02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:16.470
you know,
they'll pull,
they'll post up on Twitter and they'll say,

2179
02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:19.080
I did my first Jiu Jitsu class yesterday.

2180
02:14:19.081 --> 02:14:23.940
I got submitted and beat up and I got submitted by a 15 year old girl.

2181
02:14:24.570 --> 02:14:26.280
You know,
it's the best thing ever,
right.

2182
02:14:26.281 --> 02:14:30.480
Some people say that because I think we're are doing a good job of setting the

2183
02:14:30.481 --> 02:14:35.010
expectations of the fact that it's going to,
you're going to get humbled,

2184
02:14:35.490 --> 02:14:39.630
nay.
One,
you're going to get humbled.
I actually don't care who you are.
Yeah.

2185
02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:43.350
You're going to get humbled because even if you're a d one wrestler,

2186
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:46.230
you're going to come in there and it's gonna be humbling cause you're not gonna

2187
02:14:46.231 --> 02:14:49.350
be able to quite do what you think you're going to be able to do.
I mean,

2188
02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:52.190
you'll kill it.
Yeah.
You'll be able to take someone down.
You'll be able to,

2189
02:14:52.210 --> 02:14:55.230
you'll be,
but you won't be able to make them tap.
You won't really know how to,

2190
02:14:55.231 --> 02:14:57.030
I mean if,
unless the person doesn't know anything,

2191
02:14:57.031 --> 02:14:59.490
but if you're going against a blue belt or a purple belt,

2192
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:04.380
going to be hard for you.
Yeah.
So my first,
um,
it was like,
it wasn't,

2193
02:15:04.381 --> 02:15:08.430
it was technically,
I guess my first or second day in a class setting.

2194
02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:09.540
It wasn't with dean.
You know,

2195
02:15:09.541 --> 02:15:14.040
I tried like to other gyms before he joined the team and I went and they were

2196
02:15:14.041 --> 02:15:17.040
like,
yeah,
you know,
I literally one,
did you get to class that I learned,

2197
02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:20.010
I don't even remember what it was.
So they're like,
yeah,
hey role,

2198
02:15:20.070 --> 02:15:23.910
now it's time to roll.
So I'm going,
I'm going to insist that way smaller than me.

2199
02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:26.550
And he was like within,
he had like a month,

2200
02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:29.950
I think I'm wanting to experience you.
I'm way bigger than us.

2201
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:34.860
And he was a thing for like your example,
he didn't talk me out,

2202
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:39.070
but I literally couldn't do anything gas and I'm so tired,
I'm cute.

2203
02:15:39.071 --> 02:15:42.830
And I'm like two 25 like solid.
He doesn't care.
He's,

2204
02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:47.590
and he's won 50 here's a eats about one 50 yes,
but here's the thing,

2205
02:15:47.650 --> 02:15:52.200
he's like a month or two in is a complete white belt too.
But I'm like new guy,

2206
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:55.440
but I'm weighing more athletic.
Literally I could pick this guy up over my head,

2207
02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:58.380
literally couldn't do nothing,
couldn't even pass his guard.

2208
02:15:58.381 --> 02:16:01.250
And I knew what a guard pass.
I knew like you have to pass this guy's there.

2209
02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:04.770
And he was telling and he told me afterwards,
he was like,
Hey,
like you're,

2210
02:16:04.771 --> 02:16:06.870
you're expanding too much energy,
all this stuff or whatever.

2211
02:16:06.871 --> 02:16:09.240
And I'm thinking in my head,
man,
I don't,
I don't know that.

2212
02:16:09.241 --> 02:16:10.650
I mean obviously cause I'm tired,

2213
02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:15.270
but it just goes to show how much you just don't know about when you go in,

2214
02:16:16.050 --> 02:16:19.200
even though you're,
you're big and strong or whatever.
So yes,
you will get home.

2215
02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:21.780
Yeah.
You expect that part of it.

2216
02:16:22.530 --> 02:16:26.340
And then instead of when you do get beat up,
when you get choked,

2217
02:16:26.341 --> 02:16:29.920
when you get arm lock,
instead of getting mad and thinking,

2218
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.100
<v 2>I'm never going to do this again,
think to yourself,</v>

2219
02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:38.220
I'm going to do this a lot until I can get good enough that some unknown person

2220
02:16:39.310 --> 02:16:44.020
can really
impose their will on me as a human being.

2221
02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:48.500
I didn't like that feeling,
man.
Yeah.
Well yeah,
it just,
it goes to show like that.

2222
02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:53.620
It,
it matters what response you have to it.
That's like the what really matters.

2223
02:16:53.621 --> 02:16:55.720
So yeah,
we are,
we're all going to get beat up.

2224
02:16:55.721 --> 02:16:59.050
We're all going to get submitted multiple,
when I say multiple,

2225
02:16:59.230 --> 02:17:02.590
probably thousands by people who are smaller.

2226
02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:04.150
Who Do you figure you want to start?

2227
02:17:04.151 --> 02:17:07.980
You get submitted 10 times a day when you start oil.
Yeah.

2228
02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:11.200
So you're getting submitted 50 times a week if you're training five days a week.

2229
02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:15.370
Yeah.
Smaller than you.
Bigger than you.
Smaller,
whoever,
all different people.

2230
02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:17.740
So yeah.
So how are you going to respond?
Are you going to respond?
My thing,

2231
02:17:17.741 --> 02:17:20.020
I never want that experience ever again.
Ever again.

2232
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:23.590
Or are you just wanting to be with,
I want that skill,

2233
02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:25.780
whatever this guy obviously has or the,

2234
02:17:25.781 --> 02:17:29.110
all these people obviously have got it from this place by the way.

2235
02:17:29.470 --> 02:17:32.650
I know that too.
Yup.
Am I going to choose to be,
no,

2236
02:17:33.180 --> 02:17:35.470
I don't want that skill somewhere else.

2237
02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:39.460
You don't have to go to like some other country.
Yeah,

2238
02:17:39.461 --> 02:17:42.580
and generally in America you can just go down.

2239
02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:47.320
You can Google maps and you can find nine Jujitsu schools.

2240
02:17:47.590 --> 02:17:50.440
Well,
maybe not me around in San Diego.
You can.
In southern California,

2241
02:17:51.010 --> 02:17:52.690
if you're in other parts of the country,

2242
02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.750
you can probably find to try to options where you are most likely.
Yeah.

2243
02:17:56.950 --> 02:18:00.310
Now you could be way out in the middle.
Nowhere.
Cool.
Get some maths,

2244
02:18:00.370 --> 02:18:04.570
get some friends,
get one of those online programs.
You start learning,

2245
02:18:04.571 --> 02:18:07.570
go to youtube.
Youtube is free.
Free.
Just start.

2246
02:18:07.630 --> 02:18:11.710
Listen to what they're saying and trying it on your buddies and you'll start to

2247
02:18:11.711 --> 02:18:16.340
learn Jujitsu.
Yeah.
Boom.
On the path to get your,

2248
02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:20.080
get an origin g a hundred percent made in America.
Good.
Jeez.

2249
02:18:20.081 --> 02:18:22.110
Here's the engineered for Jujitsu.

2250
02:18:23.970 --> 02:18:28.660
Great train was commenting on his new origin gate,
the new one.
He was like,
oh,

2251
02:18:28.661 --> 02:18:30.490
it's like a pearl.
It's like a thing and I,

2252
02:18:30.491 --> 02:18:33.550
and he doesn't like geek out over that kind of stuff typically.

2253
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:38.410
But he was and for good reason and you know you kind of gloss over like made in

2254
02:18:38.411 --> 02:18:40.510
America.
That's actually a really big deal.

2255
02:18:40.970 --> 02:18:45.970
It's actually bringing back an industry that had left that had left this country

2256
02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:51.850
and bringing it back where we are.

2257
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.020
We have hired the people that got left behind.

2258
02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:59.350
They're not left behind anymore.
They're up there.

2259
02:18:59.410 --> 02:19:01.270
They're making the best games in the world.

2260
02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:06.190
You know a small town in New England bringing back that economy.
Yeah.

2261
02:19:06.670 --> 02:19:09.160
So when you support origin,

2262
02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:12.700
you're actually supporting much more than Jujitsu.

2263
02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:15.100
You're supporting much more than this podcast.

2264
02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:20.410
You're actually supporting America and you're supporting the working people of

2265
02:19:20.411 --> 02:19:21.850
America.
That's what you're doing.

2266
02:19:22.330 --> 02:19:27.330
So we're going to try and continue to drive down this path to continue to grow

2267
02:19:28.461 --> 02:19:33.461
this company where we can bring a significant amount of jobs back to America,

2268
02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:37.010
employ more people,

2269
02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:42.220
and let other people grow and pay and provide for their families.

2270
02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:44.270
That's what the goal is.

2271
02:19:44.271 --> 02:19:49.271
And it feels great to go up to Farmington and be there in the factory and see

2272
02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:54.760
what is being made by this tradition of craftsmanship.

2273
02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:58.820
And you know,
right now we're,
we're bringing on the shoes,

2274
02:19:58.821 --> 02:20:03.580
the boots and same thing.
We got people that,
you know,

2275
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:08.300
haven't been able to work in this industry for 12 years and since they shut down

2276
02:20:08.301 --> 02:20:12.680
the factories up there and outsourced the jobs and sent the machines overseas.

2277
02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:15.840
So that's what actually happened to actually happen.

2278
02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:20.000
And the people talk about the,
the,

2279
02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:23.990
the corporate greed,
right?
Hey,

2280
02:20:24.470 --> 02:20:26.990
it's going to cost me whatever it's going to cost me.

2281
02:20:26.991 --> 02:20:30.140
I can save a little bit of money by shipping these things overseas.

2282
02:20:30.350 --> 02:20:34.910
We'll let all these people go and that's fine.
I don't care.
Well,

2283
02:20:34.911 --> 02:20:37.070
we do care,
we do care.

2284
02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:41.480
And we recognize that the strength of America comes from our economy and the

2285
02:20:41.481 --> 02:20:43.790
strength of our economy comes from the ability of our,

2286
02:20:44.330 --> 02:20:48.530
of the working people in America to have a job and work hard and make the best

2287
02:20:48.531 --> 02:20:52.540
product in the world.
That's what we're doing.
Yeah man.
And overall to it,

2288
02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:56.540
Pete has that cool little series where it'll sort,
it'll show the little,
yeah.

2289
02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:59.040
Yeah.
So he's like,
yeah we have this problem.
So I'm,

2290
02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:00.440
I think I'm going to call this guy.

2291
02:21:00.530 --> 02:21:05.210
And this guy he's talking about is the old school expert who,
you know,

2292
02:21:05.211 --> 02:21:09.380
like it doesn't do it anymore for sure.
But he has all this call,
this knowledge,

2293
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:12.450
he comes in,
boom,
boom.
Solving problems and then,

2294
02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:15.460
and it shows like the interaction between like the workers and Pete and

2295
02:21:15.690 --> 02:21:19.280
everybody,
right?
So it's not like this,
I mean no offense to China,

2296
02:21:19.281 --> 02:21:23.380
but it's not like your typical go to China and you turn and burn these days,

2297
02:21:23.390 --> 02:21:27.710
you know,
no defects or whatever.
Whatever that video series is called origin HD.

2298
02:21:27.711 --> 02:21:32.270
What's the name of the,
of the,
the youtube channel is,
I think its origin.
Bjj.

2299
02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:33.471
So if you go to that,

2300
02:21:33.471 --> 02:21:37.970
you can get behind the scenes on what's being made on,

2301
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:39.750
who's making it on,

2302
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:44.750
on the kind of effort that the team up in origin is putting in to make the

2303
02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:49.160
quality that's up there.
It's,
it's awesome to watch.

2304
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:53.180
It's awesome to watch so that they got a bunch of clothes up there too.

2305
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:57.920
Rash Guards,
um,
you know,
t shirts and all that you can get from origin.

2306
02:21:58.040 --> 02:21:59.480
We also,
yeah,
and,

2307
02:21:59.481 --> 02:22:04.481
and now we have genes which are going to be live like this week we have where

2308
02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:09.260
they're in production.
We hired a bunch of people,
a bunch of more people.

2309
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:14.950
So don't just run out and buy a pair of jeans made in China by somebody in a

2310
02:22:15.411 --> 02:22:16.244
sweat shop,

2311
02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:21.670
buy a pair of jeans here that are made in America from the dirt until they're on

2312
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:25.950
your legs.
All that made in America.

2313
02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:31.140
So yeah,
you can get that.
We also have a,
we also have supplements,

2314
02:22:32.730 --> 02:22:35.730
supplements that,
supplements that.

2315
02:22:35.731 --> 02:22:38.610
I basically wanted to make exactly how I wanted them.

2316
02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:41.790
That's basically what they are saying,
Hey,

2317
02:22:41.791 --> 02:22:45.570
this is what has always worked for me.
These things,
put them together,

2318
02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:50.130
combine them,
um,
and,
and,
and make them,

2319
02:22:50.310 --> 02:22:52.770
and also,
by the way,
if it's something that I'm going to eat,

2320
02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:54.840
make it taste good and here's how we're going to do it,

2321
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:58.230
we're going to sweeten it with monk fruit,

2322
02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:03.390
which is a fruit.
Obviously it's not a camp.

2323
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:05.250
There's not some,
you know,

2324
02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:10.380
group of whatever scientist in a laboratory trying to create something that

2325
02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:14.400
tastes good through a bunch of cancer causing crap.
No,
I'm taking a fruit,

2326
02:23:14.430 --> 02:23:16.770
putting it in there.
That's why milk tastes so good.

2327
02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:22.500
Is there any better way to get additional needed protein?
No,

2328
02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:27.030
there is not a little better way.
Now my house where I live,

2329
02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:32.440
my family now,
it's who can make the best milkshake,
right?

2330
02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:37.830
I mean my wife comes in the other day,
she's holding the Gob and she's like,

2331
02:23:37.831 --> 02:23:41.940
she gets,
she lets me tasting.
I'm like,
what in God's name?
It's so good.

2332
02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:45.780
So good.
I don't even want to eat anything else.

2333
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:50.190
It was coconut milk,
vanilla gorilla,

2334
02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:55.680
three ice cubes,
one chunk,
like a quarter of a banana.

2335
02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:59.850
The thing tasted like,
uh,
uh,
uh,
Gore made dessert.

2336
02:24:01.070 --> 02:24:05.640
Redonkulous if you [inaudible] this is a little added thing.
I put some,

2337
02:24:05.730 --> 02:24:09.620
uh,
like MCT oil or coconut frozen a little,
you'll hear,
you know,

2338
02:24:09.630 --> 02:24:12.360
like just a little bit,
not like too much or whatever.
And it's weird.

2339
02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:15.660
So it more adds to the texture than it does the taste.

2340
02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.830
But that's like a little sneaky way to make your tastes more quality than,

2341
02:24:19.890 --> 02:24:24.230
than the other competitors.
It's ridiculous that it could be good for you.
Yeah,

2342
02:24:24.390 --> 02:24:28.880
it is.
Cause you feel like you're just ate an ice cream shake.
Right.

2343
02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:32.970
But you didn't,
you got high quality protein,
you got probiotics.

2344
02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:37.710
Oh,
it's getting ridiculous.
Sneaky thing you do with your kids by the way.

2345
02:24:37.711 --> 02:24:41.370
You can use where you can walk to or whatever,
whichever.
By the way,
strawberry,

2346
02:24:41.850 --> 02:24:45.990
strawberry milk for adults is coming.
It should be out pretty soon.

2347
02:24:46.050 --> 02:24:49.500
And I've tried it.
It's,
it's absolutely,

2348
02:24:49.501 --> 02:24:52.860
completely and utterly ridiculous how good it tastes and that it can be good for

2349
02:24:52.861 --> 02:24:57.340
you.
Yeah,
it's totally ridiculous.
Did they send you a sample of it?
Of the,

2350
02:24:57.690 --> 02:25:00.930
of the strawberry adult milk?
Oh No,
no,
no.

2351
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:04.980
I can't believe it.
Okay.
So anyways,
there you go.

2352
02:25:05.010 --> 02:25:06.390
So what you do with your kids is,

2353
02:25:06.391 --> 02:25:08.130
you know how you got to threaten them with punishment.

2354
02:25:08.131 --> 02:25:10.140
Every once in a while I'll say,
hey,
no dessert.

2355
02:25:10.290 --> 02:25:12.570
Or you want to use it as an incentive.
Like,
Hey,

2356
02:25:12.571 --> 02:25:14.640
if you can clean up your room within the next,
you know,

2357
02:25:14.641 --> 02:25:18.260
three minutes or whatever,
you can have a mall,
I'll give you a yes.

2358
02:25:18.261 --> 02:25:20.850
And don't even say multiple.
Just get hockey.
I'll make you a,

2359
02:25:20.851 --> 02:25:23.990
unless they already know,
unless they're in the know then it,
but you

2360
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:27.550
<v 3>said,
I'll give you a special dessert or treat or whatever.</v>

2361
02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:32.150
You make it with the milk.
You put the little bit of Amse,
DOL,
you know,

2362
02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:35.170
you make it taste all gourmet the way you did.
So boom,

2363
02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:37.420
they clean up their room within three minutes.
By the way,

2364
02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.520
whenever time parameters,
you get home,

2365
02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:44.820
they get the Malke all thinking they won,
they won the game.
You know,

2366
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:48.860
I did that little task that you told me that and I,
and I saved the deal.
Right.

2367
02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:52.010
God,
my dessert.
You want to,

2368
02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:56.620
to the whole team one team,
one whole team.
I like it.
Uh,

2369
02:25:57.340 --> 02:25:59.170
don't forget about joint warfarin.
Krill oil.

2370
02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:04.230
Recently Leif Babin forgot about joint warfare and he got off the mat and he,

2371
02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:06.700
he texted me,
he's like,
Bro,

2372
02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:09.220
I didn't take joint warfare for like three days for whatever.

2373
02:26:09.221 --> 02:26:13.330
He's traveling or wants something.
And he's like,
I got done rolling.

2374
02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:16.090
And I was like,
man,
why am I so jacked up?
Oh yeah.

2375
02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:17.890
Because I haven't taken any joint warfare.

2376
02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:21.930
Got Back on the joint warfare back on the good to go train.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2377
02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:25.000
Which was ironic and I addressed this on that.
Uh,

2378
02:26:25.001 --> 02:26:29.880
there was a post that he made his out,
the one that they,
yeah,
so I'm meeting,

2379
02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:31.900
we posted it cause he was like,
I can't even believe this.

2380
02:26:31.901 --> 02:26:35.860
It's ridiculous the difference that you notice yet.

2381
02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:37.210
And like I said,

2382
02:26:37.211 --> 02:26:41.650
the irony there is early on it wasn't with joint where it feels with Krill oil.

2383
02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:46.180
I forgot mine in New York.
Oh yeah,
in New York.
And Jenna comes in,
you know,

2384
02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:49.050
actually I told [inaudible],
I told her a bunch of people,
but you know,

2385
02:26:49.290 --> 02:26:50.940
no one really wanting to give me any

2386
02:26:54.330 --> 02:26:58.000
because I traveled with like the number of that I need for that time period that

2387
02:26:58.001 --> 02:27:00.710
army gone for.
I can't spare any.
It's really neutral.

2388
02:27:00.730 --> 02:27:05.720
Running around with like extra krill oil.
Should you
change,

2389
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:08.110
you're not going to be by water in the field.
I carried it.

2390
02:27:08.111 --> 02:27:13.030
I'm drinking it unless you're going to die.
Maybe I'll say really?
Yeah,
exactly.

2391
02:27:13.650 --> 02:27:16.660
In high school when I went,
me and jade would,
when my brother,

2392
02:27:16.690 --> 02:27:17.890
me and my brother would lift.

2393
02:27:18.130 --> 02:27:22.930
So we were real like discipline with the post workout meal.
Right.

2394
02:27:22.931 --> 02:27:26.620
And it wouldn't,
I wouldn't say it would be measured out,
but there'd be enough,

2395
02:27:26.621 --> 02:27:28.900
you know,
you'd have to have a specific amount for the postworkout meal.

2396
02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:34.060
So if we were to go buy Sushi or go buy something like good and they'd be,

2397
02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:37.600
you know,
my brother,
I would ask,
oh,
let me get something,
let me taste it.

2398
02:27:37.630 --> 02:27:42.340
We'd say,
I can't spare the nutrients so I can't give you any I want to share,

2399
02:27:42.350 --> 02:27:46.210
but I can't square the nutrients from my,
from my workout,
whatever.
So that's no,

2400
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:51.040
that's what you did.
That's what you do with your CHRO.
None the less that,
uh,

2401
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:54.340
after a few hours of,
of failure,
you know,

2402
02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:58.810
getting more krill oil general Leif Babin came through with the Krill oil.

2403
02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:02.920
Nice.
Yeah.
So it's kind of newer back in the game.
Oh,
huge time.

2404
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:04.510
So it was just ironic that leaf,

2405
02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:09.400
Jenna's husband went through the same deal.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2406
02:28:09.401 --> 02:28:13.080
You gotta be careful with that.
You don't want to run down,
fall off.
And you do,

2407
02:28:13.090 --> 02:28:14.740
you mentioned where your kid mark,

2408
02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:18.670
if you've got kids getting more of your kid milk,
don't even play around,

2409
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:20.990
don't even play around.
What are you gonna give them

2410
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:25.310
<v 2>a Hershey's syrup to make chocolate milk?</v>

2411
02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:29.060
You'd give them Nestle's Quik to make chocolate milk.

2412
02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:33.800
Why don't you just give them a big glass of type two diabetes?

2413
02:28:35.570 --> 02:28:38.810
Because that's what you're doing.
Or you can say,
hey,

2414
02:28:38.811 --> 02:28:43.760
here's something that tastes better and is incredibly good for you.

2415
02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:47.180
Yes.
So there you go.
Where your kid mark,
you can get some of that.

2416
02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:52.700
Also you want to represent while on the path jock was a store.

2417
02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:57.500
It's called Jocko store,
obviously original.
Yeah,
we all know that.

2418
02:28:57.680 --> 02:28:58.513
I think by now,

2419
02:28:58.610 --> 02:29:02.810
well actually maybe not everybody on the less Jocko store.com that's where you

2420
02:29:02.811 --> 02:29:06.290
can get your discipline equals freedom tee shirts,

2421
02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:09.860
rash guards knew and out.
By the way,

2422
02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:14.980
if a new rash guard out stand by to get some stand by to get some Jujitsu or

2423
02:29:16.161 --> 02:29:17.540
well where it is you're doing wait,

2424
02:29:17.541 --> 02:29:20.480
stand by to get the new rash guard or that's what the grass card says.
Well

2425
02:29:22.450 --> 02:29:27.080
good.
All right,
cool.
T shirts,
rash guards,
hats,
truckers had CBDS,

2426
02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:31.480
lightweight hoodies.
For those of you that live in the lower 48 states.
Nope.

2427
02:29:31.481 --> 02:29:35.300
Brady Lanter texted me.
He was like [inaudible] he's in Michigan,

2428
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:40.060
he's in Michigan.
He said today is lightweight Hoodie Day.
So yeah.

2429
02:29:40.370 --> 02:29:43.610
Well he also did a good job of posting that little thing of him out in the

2430
02:29:43.611 --> 02:29:45.410
freezing cold and he was like,

2431
02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:50.230
we just need a lightweight up here cause he's hard to go.
Oh,
okay,
here's our car.

2432
02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:53.570
Well,
right.
Hey,
if you're not as hardcore as Brady in those circumstances,

2433
02:29:53.571 --> 02:29:56.840
we have heavy weighted,
he's two.
So boom,
light and heavy,
whatever you need,

2434
02:29:56.841 --> 02:30:00.860
whatever you like.
A lot of cool stuff on there.
If he likes something good.

2435
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:04.460
So don't forget about Jocko white tea,
which I am currently drinking.

2436
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:07.490
And the reason I'm drinking it as nominally cause it tastes good,

2437
02:30:07.491 --> 02:30:12.350
but also because I like having an 8,000 pound dead lift factually 100%

2438
02:30:12.351 --> 02:30:14.720
guaranteed.
If you don't,
if you,

2439
02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:19.400
if you drink a Jocko white tea and you can't dead lift a thousand pounds,

2440
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:24.920
you can send me the empty can and I'll send you the nickel for the can.
Yeah.

2441
02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:29.780
So that's,
don't forget to subscribe to the podcast because if you don't,

2442
02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:34.740
then you just don't have to know what you're thinking.
World subscribe.
Yeah.

2443
02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:36.830
If you don't subscribe,
then you're not subscribed,

2444
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:41.480
which isn't good because it gets,
when we launch it,
occasionally rare occasion,

2445
02:30:41.481 --> 02:30:44.960
we launched something randomly for like some kind of an event,

2446
02:30:44.961 --> 02:30:48.380
some kind of a situation for launch the rent.
So if you're just expecting,
oh,

2447
02:30:48.381 --> 02:30:50.480
it's Wednesday,
I know what I'm going to get,
get the podcast,

2448
02:30:50.481 --> 02:30:53.160
then you'd jump on there.
There was another one waiting for you.
Yeah.

2449
02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:56.060
So if you want to get those,
no,

2450
02:30:56.061 --> 02:30:59.450
those subscribe to the podcast wherever you subscribed to a podcast and don't

2451
02:30:59.451 --> 02:31:03.860
forget about the warrior kid podcast,
which is awesome.

2452
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:06.531
For some reason,

2453
02:31:06.531 --> 02:31:09.590
I always clear myself hot to say that warrior kid stuff is awesome.

2454
02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:14.930
I think it's because I'm saying it as like a dad.

2455
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:19.310
You know what I mean?
I'm not saying it directed at myself.
Yeah.
Look,

2456
02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:23.910
I don't mean like,
Hey,
I'm great at the warrior kid podcast.
I'm,
I'm lost.

2457
02:31:23.930 --> 02:31:27.060
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying it as a dad.

2458
02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:29.430
If you can get your kid to listen to warrior could podcast,

2459
02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:34.920
it will benefit them greatly and trying to figure out the ways of the world.

2460
02:31:34.990 --> 02:31:39.360
Yeah.
And how to live in this crazy world that we have.

2461
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:44.630
And also there's a warrior kid that makes soap in central California.

2462
02:31:45.690 --> 02:31:48.630
Well,
I guess it's southern California,
but anyways,
Irish oaks,

2463
02:31:48.631 --> 02:31:53.610
ranch.com young aid and running a business that he's 13 years old.

2464
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:58.260
Pretty soon he's not going to be a kid anymore,
but in the meantime,

2465
02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:01.320
get some of his soap so you can stay clean.

2466
02:32:02.010 --> 02:32:05.340
And we got a youtube video channel,
is that what it's called?

2467
02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:12.760
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
Two video channel.
Yeah,
right.
As opposed to youtube what?</v>

2468
02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:16.560
<v 2>Jay Audio Channel.
Audio channel.
Well anyways,</v>

2469
02:32:16.561 --> 02:32:19.530
on that video channel on Youtube,

2470
02:32:19.710 --> 02:32:23.340
which the video channel is called Jocko podcast.

2471
02:32:24.270 --> 02:32:27.030
That's the video channel,
right?
So if you go to that,

2472
02:32:27.031 --> 02:32:31.470
you can watch a bunch of videos that Echo Charles made and you can watch this

2473
02:32:31.471 --> 02:32:35.280
podcast.
You can see what Echo Charles looks like.
He looks like,

2474
02:32:35.460 --> 02:32:40.440
not like what he sounds epidemic evidently.
And also he makes he,

2475
02:32:40.441 --> 02:32:45.330
he's he,
what do you,
what do you experiment with?

2476
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:50.010
Yeah,
he makes videos with his own personal skills.

2477
02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:54.660
Right?
You have such an eloquent,

2478
02:32:55.110 --> 02:33:00.000
interesting thing is I feel like a lot of times when you make videos,
you're not,

2479
02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:04.140
you're experimenting in a way you're not,
it's not like,

2480
02:33:04.410 --> 02:33:08.910
it's not like I'm saying,
hey,
make this video and here's the effect that we want.

2481
02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:14.720
You're just over there just making videos and they just with your own vision.

2482
02:33:14.910 --> 02:33:15.743
Yeah.

2483
02:33:15.930 --> 02:33:18.630
<v 3>Well the goal.
Okay,
so the goal,</v>

2484
02:33:18.631 --> 02:33:22.140
well the goal for the whole youtube thing is sure.
The video version.

2485
02:33:22.170 --> 02:33:25.470
You want to watch the podcast,
which do,
you know men that's,
I dig it now.

2486
02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:29.460
A lot of people do that.
I did get,
um,
and then the excerpts,

2487
02:33:29.461 --> 02:33:33.270
we have excerpts on there too.
If you don't,
you know,
you can watch it.

2488
02:33:33.271 --> 02:33:37.470
You can share those.
Yeah.
Cool.
But yeah,
and then sure,

2489
02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:41.790
I'll take an excerpt.
Essentially take an excerpt and kind of video wise,

2490
02:33:41.791 --> 02:33:43.170
have some fun with it,
you know,

2491
02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:48.030
add some facts and music and stuff and yet it's very much experimental.

2492
02:33:48.031 --> 02:33:53.031
But what we should make a video of what my life would be like if everything was

2493
02:33:53.340 --> 02:33:57.120
reflective of how your videos are everywhere.
When things were exploding.

2494
02:33:57.210 --> 02:33:58.220
Thought about that.
Yeah,

2495
02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:02.510
that kind of funny actually that that warpath media that's essentially kindness

2496
02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:03.631
into the thing.

2497
02:34:03.631 --> 02:34:06.120
It's like if you're on the warpath and here's all the things that you're doing,

2498
02:34:06.121 --> 02:34:09.610
so it showed like you know the little videos like video clips of me when I,

2499
02:34:09.690 --> 02:34:13.170
or not of me that I got a view just doing their stuff.

2500
02:34:13.171 --> 02:34:16.080
Do you get to and writing and stuff so it probably,

2501
02:34:16.081 --> 02:34:18.400
if you're on the warpath that's kind of what it represents

2502
02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:19.990
<v 2>a little bit.
Assume scenes.
Yeah,</v>

2503
02:34:20.330 --> 02:34:24.670
just a path of destruction in a constructive way check,

2504
02:34:24.671 --> 02:34:27.070
so you can do that.
You can also get psychological warfare,

2505
02:34:27.071 --> 02:34:32.071
which is a little bunch of tracks to help you overcome moments of weakness,

2506
02:34:32.531 --> 02:34:37.030
which apparently are quite effective because I've had many people explained to

2507
02:34:37.031 --> 02:34:40.600
me that they utilize them regularly,

2508
02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:43.750
so psychological warfare,
iTunes,
Google play,

2509
02:34:44.210 --> 02:34:48.640
MP3 platforms of all kinds.
You can,
you can check that out.

2510
02:34:48.970 --> 02:34:52.720
Also check out flipside canvas,
which is Dakota Meyer.

2511
02:34:52.721 --> 02:34:55.630
If you haven't listened to episode one 15 of this podcast,

2512
02:34:55.631 --> 02:34:59.740
it's one of the most popular podcasts,

2513
02:35:00.190 --> 02:35:01.930
one of the heaviest podcasts.

2514
02:35:03.130 --> 02:35:08.130
What of most impactful podcasts and there's a lot of impactful podcasts and I

2515
02:35:08.591 --> 02:35:13.580
guess that's saying a lot,
but uh,
Dakota's making,
what are they,

2516
02:35:13.581 --> 02:35:16.480
what was he making?
One of those things called canvas.

2517
02:35:16.481 --> 02:35:21.481
Canvas is Bart art hanging in pieces and they,

2518
02:35:22.990 --> 02:35:26.170
he's got a bunch of different ones but he actually has made some kind of based

2519
02:35:26.171 --> 02:35:27.790
on this podcast,

2520
02:35:28.390 --> 02:35:31.720
he's got one that says discipline equals freedom and he's got one that says
good.

2521
02:35:32.410 --> 02:35:37.180
He's got one that says time is running out and he's got one that says get after

2522
02:35:37.181 --> 02:35:39.430
it.
So if you want to get one of those,

2523
02:35:39.431 --> 02:35:42.850
if you want to post that thing up then you can post it up.

2524
02:35:42.910 --> 02:35:46.510
You can just have a giant get after it on your ceiling where you sleep when you

2525
02:35:46.511 --> 02:35:47.090
wake up in the morning,

2526
02:35:47.090 --> 02:35:50.410
the first thing you see is a giant sign that says get after it.

2527
02:35:51.010 --> 02:35:53.380
So check out that.
Yes,
very good ones too.

2528
02:35:53.381 --> 02:35:55.700
I was looking at was actually browsing like a bunch of them.

2529
02:35:56.030 --> 02:36:00.730
Those are good men and made in America.
I forgot to say that,
but once again,

2530
02:36:00.731 --> 02:36:05.110
same thing.
Same thing as origin,
but now we're in Texas.
We're building,

2531
02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:08.620
we have the factory where making them,
we're printing them.

2532
02:36:09.270 --> 02:36:10.480
It's all American made,

2533
02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:15.660
so you're not just supporting Dakota who is an awesome guy to support.

2534
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:21.250
You're also supporting just America in general,
which is a positive thing.

2535
02:36:22.750 --> 02:36:27.070
Also expanding our,
our home gyms.

2536
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:29.230
This is what we're going to do.

2537
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:34.230
We're going to go to audit.com/ [inaudible] and get your stuff there.

2538
02:36:35.410 --> 02:36:39.970
That's where you get good stuff.
Rings,
Kettlebells,
Kettlebells,

2539
02:36:39.971 --> 02:36:44.350
big deal.
That's like a staple.
The rings in the kettlebells.
Big staple in

2540
02:36:48.490 --> 02:36:53.110
a lot of good stuff on there.
Some those elk bars.
Oh yeah,

2541
02:36:53.210 --> 02:36:56.470
yeah.
Those are a big deal to those will come in the,
in the clutch.

2542
02:36:56.471 --> 02:36:59.860
When you want a little snack,
you need a little something.

2543
02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:03.730
Get yourself one of those elk bars especially,
and if you're,

2544
02:37:04.270 --> 02:37:05.920
if you're lifting kettle bells,

2545
02:37:05.921 --> 02:37:09.970
you probably going to need some elk bars to supplement the scenario.
Oh yeah.

2546
02:37:09.971 --> 02:37:14.530
Big Time.
A lot of good stuff on there.
Like the,

2547
02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:18.950
like the
characters or whatever.
Right.

2548

Yes.
Yeah,

Do you,

2550
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:29.420
do you feel pride when you say that answers Oquist yes.
Yes.

2551
02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:33.740
As if like that makes you better than me.
A little bit.
Yeah.
Yes,

2552
02:37:33.741 --> 02:37:35.600
they do little bit,
but the,
yeah,

2553
02:37:35.601 --> 02:37:40.080
we'll what our wars doesn't really hit me like strong.
Yeah.

2554
02:37:40.190 --> 02:37:44.930
Yeah.
All right.
No it's good.
But it doesn't,

2555
02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:49.220
I don't know.
Well they have the Mar.
What about marvel?
Cause they have like a um,

2556
02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:53.530
uh,
iron man one to her
doesn't really.
Yeah,

2557
02:37:53.540 --> 02:37:57.130
that doesn't surprise me.
But it's dope though.
Yeah,
no,

2558
02:37:57.131 --> 02:37:59.280
I saw which one did you get?
Did you get Darth Vader know?

2559
02:37:59.290 --> 02:38:01.370
You've talked about the storm trooper?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2560
02:38:01.420 --> 02:38:03.550
I'm going to get the Darth Vader one for sure.
Let me get all that much.
Does,

2561
02:38:03.551 --> 02:38:07.480
how much does Darth Vader way,
um,
is that the biggest regret that,

2562
02:38:07.481 --> 02:38:10.300
because what's the biggest,
like a 48?
No,
it's bigger.

2563
02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:14.490
It's bigger than a 48 kilogram.
Oh No,
no,
no.
Oh,
sorry.
Sorry.

2564
02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:18.070
I was going to say that's the biggest I have.
It might be the seventh step up.

2565
02:38:18.071 --> 02:38:22.000
This arms race,
war
40 kilograms,

2566
02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:26.140
so all it's over a hundred pounds,
six pounds.
What's your biggest?

2567
02:38:26.170 --> 02:38:29.850
My biggest one is the big foot one.
90 90 pounds or something like that.
Okay,

2568
02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:34.990
that's cool.
Whatever.
But last anyway on.com a lot of good stuff on there.

2569
02:38:34.991 --> 02:38:36.040
Get something.
Hey,

2570
02:38:36.041 --> 02:38:40.870
I've got a bunch of books to Mike and the dragons book for younger kids where

2571
02:38:40.871 --> 02:38:44.200
they learn to deal with and overcome fear.

2572
02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:48.520
Weigh the warrior kid and Mark's mission and now we have booked three coming out

2573
02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:53.590
and actually a little kid posted a book review of way the warrior kid and we

2574
02:38:53.591 --> 02:38:58.360
have to repost it,
but it's legit,
you know,
little kids,
a BMX racer,

2575
02:38:58.710 --> 02:39:02.560
he talks about all the rules of the way the warrior kit and how they apply to

2576
02:39:02.561 --> 02:39:06.850
his life.
How he has to take care of his BMX bike,
take care of your gear,

2577
02:39:07.090 --> 02:39:09.640
has to eat properly,
has to get up early,
get on the plan.

2578
02:39:10.180 --> 02:39:15.180
So pretty cool to see if you want your kids to be on the plan or if you want

2579
02:39:15.191 --> 02:39:19.330
your neighbor kids to be on the plan or if you want your kids at the school get

2580
02:39:19.331 --> 02:39:23.140
this book series of books where the work at Mark's mission and book three coming

2581
02:39:23.141 --> 02:39:27.460
out.
It'd be on the LBR available for preorder very soon.
I'll let everyone know.

2582
02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:31.840
It's called a where there's a will and then the discipline equals freedom field

2583
02:39:31.841 --> 02:39:32.674
manual.

2584
02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:38.030
Just how to get after it mentally and physically.

2585
02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:39.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2586
02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:44.410
<v 2>And emotionally.
Sure.
Feelings with it.</v>

2587
02:39:44.710 --> 02:39:49.000
The fact that that book is continuing,

2588
02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:53.530
it's continuing to get the best feedback on that book.
Yeah,
so it was cool.

2589
02:39:53.531 --> 02:39:55.810
Now people are posting no pictures of it.
Yeah.
Okay.

2590
02:39:55.811 --> 02:39:59.530
This page got me through today,
so there you go.

2591
02:39:59.790 --> 02:40:04.000
Just one goes freedom field manual.
Get that one.
It's not on audible.

2592
02:40:04.510 --> 02:40:09.190
It's on iTunes.
Amazon music,
Google play on MP3 platforms.

2593
02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:11.080
Don't forget about extreme ownership.

2594
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:14.010
The first book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin

2595
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:17.730
<v 1>about what we learned in combat and he how you can apply it to your business and</v>

2596
02:40:17.731 --> 02:40:18.930
your world and your life.

2597
02:40:18.931 --> 02:40:22.590
And then we followed that up with the dichotomy of leadership at which we are

2598
02:40:22.591 --> 02:40:25.590
now getting multiple reports from the battlefield.

2599
02:40:25.591 --> 02:40:28.560
That the dichotomy of leadership,
it's is a little bit better.

2600
02:40:28.770 --> 02:40:31.980
<v 2>People think,
Eh,
I am,
I am.</v>

2601
02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:35.460
I kind of felt that way.
But you know,

2602
02:40:35.461 --> 02:40:39.570
extreme ownership has the core like it's always going to have,

2603
02:40:39.571 --> 02:40:41.100
it's always going to be the bigger brother.

2604
02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:47.340
But you never know man dichotomy sometimes that that other kid,
right?
Yeah,

2605
02:40:47.341 --> 02:40:50.730
that was,
the other kid has the,
has a little bit,
he can learn lessons.

2606
02:40:50.850 --> 02:40:52.440
That's exactly what happened with dichotomy.

2607
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:55.380
We learned lessons after we wrote extreme ownership and said,

2608
02:40:55.381 --> 02:40:56.214
you know what the most,

2609
02:40:56.310 --> 02:40:59.910
you know what the hardest thing for people to do is balanced the dichotomy of

2610
02:40:59.911 --> 02:41:03.750
leadership.
That was chapter 12 in extreme ownership.
Then it became a whole book.

2611
02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:09.270
So it was kind of like Rambo.
Right.
You know?
So Rambo,
when people say,
who do you,

2612
02:41:09.271 --> 02:41:14.170
what do you think your ramble,
they're talking about Rambo first blood part too,

2613
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:18.210
right?
Dichotomy is kind of like Rambo where like people are like,
oh,

2614
02:41:18.211 --> 02:41:19.650
I love the dichotomy it up.
But,

2615
02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:24.340
but the people who know know that first blood is the real movies.

2616
02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:27.700
The real oh g one that ramble is not better.
Ramble.

2617
02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:31.770
Ramble gets a lot of glory.
They get the praise and it's awesome.
Well,

2618
02:41:31.771 --> 02:41:36.540
one thing that I guarantee you is the dichotomy of leadership is not jaws to
yes.

2619
02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:41.600
Which no one talks about jaws to Dolan cares about Johnston was one is epic

2620
02:41:42.901 --> 02:41:43.120
thick.

2621
02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:43.953
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2622
02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:49.740
So the dichotomy of leadership is it is epic in its own right and it can stand

2623
02:41:50.711 --> 02:41:53.530
on its own.
Yes.
But it's still going to be,
it's still on the shadow.

2624
02:41:53.531 --> 02:41:55.330
It seems to be coming out from the shadow.
I guess that's what I'm saying.

2625
02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:58.150
Just like Rambo.
Okay,
well that's good.

2626
02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:01.150
Don't forget about echelon front.

Maybe,

Give them a gentle massage.

2642
02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:09.610
Don't be mad at me.

I'm trying to take ownership right now,

2643
02:43:09.611 --> 02:43:10.810
telling you that it's gonna sell out.

2644
02:43:10.811 --> 02:43:13.510
I'm taking ownership of the fact that it's going to sell out and I'm trying to

2645
02:43:13.511 --> 02:43:17.800
communicate it to you.
Hopefully you listen.
So that's that ETF online.

2646
02:43:17.801 --> 02:43:22.801
If you can't make it to the monster or let's say you got 300 people in your

2647
02:43:22.961 --> 02:43:26.590
company or 3000 people in your company and you want to bring him all the muster

2648
02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:30.850
and you,
you can't or you want to bring echelon front end,
but echelon front,

2649
02:43:31.180 --> 02:43:34.520
we can't travel to the nine countries that your company is located in.

2650
02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:38.350
So guess what?
That's why we made,

2652

2653
02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:56.830
So it's online,
but it's not just watching videos,
it's,
yes,
there's videos,

2654
02:43:56.831 --> 02:43:58.960
but it's also interactive where you,

2655
02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:02.800
where you get put into leadership scenarios and then you have to figure out what

2656
02:44:02.801 --> 02:44:05.290
to do.
And if you choose the wrong scenario,

2657
02:44:05.291 --> 02:44:10.210
you're going to lead your company or your platoon into a bad situation.

2658
02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:15.610
So check it out.
F online.com and I already talked about this,

2659
02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:16.640

you don't,
you'd,

2665
02:44:42.970 --> 02:44:46.390
I recommend you don't hire just based on experience,

2666
02:44:47.230 --> 02:44:48.190
recommend you,

2667
02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:53.310
you hire people based on the talent that they have on especially the leadership

2668
02:44:53.921 --> 02:44:58.921
capability that they have and if you want to stay in the game with us.

EMT is correctional officer's border patrols,

2676
02:45:23.850 --> 02:45:28.470
all first responders,
including the dispatchers.
I spent some time,
as I said,

2677
02:45:28.471 --> 02:45:31.530
with the police out in North Carolina recently.
And uh,

2678
02:45:32.250 --> 02:45:37.250
what a tough job and what a great bunch of people out there putting it all on

2679
02:45:37.891 --> 02:45:40.890
the line to protect us here at home.

2680
02:45:41.220 --> 02:45:46.220
And of course to our military men and women,

2681
02:45:46.860 --> 02:45:51.860
like the one that I opened up this podcast with Fred Garland,

2682
02:45:52.530 --> 02:45:57.530
Bragg junior first lieutenant U s army killed in action in Vietnam on July 12th,

2683
02:46:00.990 --> 02:46:01.823
1967

2684
02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:02.730
<v 0>okay.</v>

2685
02:46:02.730 --> 02:46:05.230
<v 1>But a hero.</v>

2686
02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:06.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2687
02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:10.010
<v 1>A leader and an example to all</v>

2688
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:13.370
<v 2>of us that regardless of the odds you are facing,</v>

2689
02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:18.810
you can stand up and you can fight.

2690
02:46:19.650 --> 02:46:20.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2691
02:46:20.270 --> 02:46:24.170
<v 2>And to everyone else out there,
you can do the same thing every day.</v>

2692
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:29.230
Stand up to whatever challenges you face and get after it

2693
02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:33.470
going.
Until next time.

2694
02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:37.970
