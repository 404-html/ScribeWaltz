00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.960
This is Jocko podcast number one oh six with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.450
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo and good evening.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.620
Now in podcast one oh five we finished just as the one seven Cav flew out of the

4
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:25.301
eye Drang valley after keeping it together during a vicious three day fight

5
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.170
where they suffered to massive casualties,

6
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.030
79 killed in action,
121 wounded the dam.
And on top of that,

7
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.420
the battlefield was littered with enemy dead with the estimates of enemy dead to

8
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:49.601
be between 500 and a thousand and we stopped there where the where the one seven

9
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.290
Cav left the battlefield.
So if you haven't listened to one oh five yet,

10
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.320
go back and listen to that before continuing with this podcast.

11
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:05.291
One Oh six because even though the one seven left the battlefield,

12
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.200
the battle wasn't over yet,
and one of the,

13
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.890
one of the events that I didn't really talk about in the first I drank podcasts

14
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.460
on on one oh five was the fact that two other battalions had arrived on the

15
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:25.811
ground to reinforce the one seven and it was the second battalion fifth cavalry

16
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.220
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Tali and the second Battalion Seventh

17
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.600
Cavalry led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Dade.

18
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.730
<v 0>Now most of the battalions men from those two battalions had landed at Lz</v>

20
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.733
Victor,

21
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.720
which was about two miles away from x ray and they had patrolled to x ray on

22
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:57.320
foot arriving for the most part without incident.

23
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.380
And then things seemed to settle down a lot.

24
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:05.381
An x ray one seven left and once one seven had left the battlefield to seven and

25
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:08.600
two five we're still there.

26
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.160
<v 0>So at that point,</v>

28
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:16.161
that portion of the battle was over and two,

29
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:21.171
seven and two five could have likely been extracted via helicopter pretty

30
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:25.080
securely.
Just at one seven had been,

31
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
it seems that General Westmoreland did not like the idea of two,

32
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:34.050
seven and two five pulling out.

33
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.400
He thought that that would appear as a retreat.

34
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.100
So he ordered that two,

35
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.190
five and two seven secure Lz x ray for the night,

36
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:49.191
and then the next day they would move by foot patrol to another LLC called Lz

37
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.930
Albany,
which was about 2.5 miles to the north.

38
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.560
And then B 52 bombers were going to rain down bombs on Lz x ray and the

39
00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:02.850
surrounding areas.

40
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.240
They didn't expect a lot of resistance because things had settled somewhat down

41
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:12.630
so much on Lz x ray that if you remember,

42
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:14.520
even towards the end of the last podcast,
there was,

43
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:17.190
reporters came in and landed at Lz x Ray,

44
00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:19.530
and we're doing camera shots and interviewing people.

45
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:21.180
So it was pretty settled down.

46
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.900
They felt like it was over and they didn't expect much resistance on this

47
00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:31.320
movement from Lz x ray to Lz Albany.

48
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.053
<v 2>Okay,</v>

49
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.540
<v 0>so let's go back to the book.</v>

50
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.370
The book is we were soldiers once and young by General Hal Moore and Joe

51
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.260
Galloway.
And like I said,
there wasn't much resistance expected.

52
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.330
And here's what it says in the book.

53
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.310
The word among Bob McDade troopers was that it was going to be a walk in the
sun,

54
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.660
a stroll over to another landing zone where the helicopters would come in and

55
00:03:57.661 --> 00:03:58.494
extract them.

56
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.630
The first leg of the journey home to on k base,

57
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.810
the word was wrong.

58
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.963
<v 2>Okay.</v>

59
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.730
<v 0>And these guys,
even though there hadn't been much fighting going on,</v>

60
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.090
they were actually a little bit tired because they had been awake on the ground.

61
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:25.860
So here we go.
Just before Alpha company,
second battalion moved out,

62
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.890
it's commander Captain Joe [inaudible] put out an unusual order.

63
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.930
His executive officer,
Lieutenant Larry Gwynn,

64
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:40.380
who we're going to hear a lot from lieutenant lyric.
Gwyn remembers it well,

65
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.310
the company had been on 100% alert for over 52 hours.

66
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.470
We were in such a state of exhaustion.

67
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.880
The captain's a denas directed that each man take two,

68
00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:54.660
eight p c tablets,
aspirin with caffeine,
uh,

69
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:59.460
move designed to increase the mental alertness of the troops.
So there you go.

70
00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:02.490
Take a little caffeine,
little aspirin,
get you guys,

71
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.130
get your head's in the game cause they'd been awake for a long time and again,

72
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:06.000
they're not expecting much,

73
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:09.430
but they still been on the ground in a hot Lz for awhile.

74
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.220
Back to the book,
Lieutenant Alley,

75
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.610
the battalions communication officer was with headquarters company.

76
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.830
We were told that this would be a tactical move.

77
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.610
There was a lot of stuff on the battlefield,
equipment supplies,
captured,

78
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:27.200
stuff that had to be policed it up and blown up all in a hurry up situation.

79
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.830
I was personally carrying an RC two 92 antenna in addition to my regular combat

80
00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:37.280
load.
I weighed about 140 pounds.

81
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.040
My normal combat load was 40 or 50 pounds.

82
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.250
The two nine two antenna weighed 60 pounds.

83
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.630
The temperature must've been 96 and the humidity was the same.

84
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.160
We were moving as fast as we could through the elephant grass and scrub oaks,

85
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.080
some high canopy.
We were humping,
everyone was as tired as could.

86
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.170
So we're already in a rough situation.

87
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.710
We've been on the ground for 52 hours and we're going to move

88
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.720
two and a half miles.
Doesn't sound very far,
but when you're carrying,

89
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.540
so he's already,
he's carrying a hundred pounds is 40,

90
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.100
50 pound combat load pluses,

91
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.420
antenna and everyone else is carrying all kinds of extra stuff,

92
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.720
but they're pulling off the Lz.
It's 96 degrees out,

93
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.310
96% humidity and walking through the jungle is never easy.
It's up and down.

94
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:24.860
Little terrain features,
uh,

95
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.550
going through various foliage is hard.

96
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.740
So this is not easy.
Not the biggest guy to buy the 140 150 pounds,

97
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:38.690
which guys were smaller back then than they are now.
100 pounds.
That's,

98
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:43.100
that's no joke.
That's no joke.
Back to the book,

99
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:47.480
Lieutenant Gary Gwyn of Alpha Company says the jungle around us got heavier and

100
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.290
heavier.
That's when things got a little scary.

101
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.530
There was a sudden absence of any air cover.

102
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.510
The guys were silent and I wondered where our Hilos and our Air Ariel rocket

103
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.320
artillery ships were.
We had not changed formation tactically,

104
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.700
but physically we had to move in much tighter to maintain visual contact because

105
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:12.350
of the undergrowth.
The terrain forced our flaker flankers in.

106
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.140
So at this point there they,
they'd had a bunch of air cover,

107
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:19.520
they don't have any air cover right now and now the terrain is making them get

108
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:23.810
closer and closer together.
Because if you and I are on on patrol,

109
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.260
I don't,
I want to keep you in visual range.
I want to be able to see you.

110
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.990
And so if all of a sudden there's elephant grass,

111
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.180
well the only way to to keep visual of you is for you to get close to me and for

112
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.280
immediate close to the next guy.

113
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.310
And so everyone starts to compress and he's talking about the flankers being out

114
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.950
there.
A lot of times when we patrol information,

115
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.820
you'll put people out on the flanks within visual range,

116
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:45.890
but they'll be stretching the visual range,

117
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.560
but they're out there to make sure that there's no one sneaking up on you.

118
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.400
And so they've,

119
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.840
it's getting dense now to the point where they can't keep their flankers out.

120
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.450
So now you're losing some of that flank security.

121
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.540
Back to the book,
Gwen says,

122
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:04.010
Alpha Company's column order integrity had been good until two prisoners were

123
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:07.070
captured and everything came to a sudden Holt

124
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.420
when I arrived.
So Jeanie's,
sue Jeanie's was interrogating the two.

125
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.760
They were in mint condition,
new weapons,
grenades,
new gear,

126
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.610
but both were feverish,
terrified and shaking.

127
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.590
None of us in company headquarters had seen alive North Vietnamese up close.

128
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.990
These were not the last we would see this day.

129
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.260
We gave them water and advise the battalion headquarters.

130
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.210
So all of a sudden they got a couple of prisoners.

131
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.220
Little scary to me when the prisoners that we take have brand new weapons,

132
00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:42.370
new grenades,
new gear,
I mean we at least know that they're fresh.

133
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.740
Maybe they're not combat hardened,

134
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:47.170
but we know that they've got some good no well supplied,

135
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.060
which is a scary thing in this type of war.

136
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.043
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

137
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.460
<v 0>So this is,
this is kind of rear looking back,</v>

138
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:59.190
hindsight of course being 2020 this is,

139
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:04.260
this is an error or a or a mistake that gets made right now.

140
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.880
And of course mistakes happen all the time and they don't get capitalized on by

141
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.360
the enemy.
Sometimes by luck,
sometimes by skill of the enemy.

142
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.860
This is one of those mistakes that it gets capitalized again,

143
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:20.940
whether it's by luck or plan,
probably by luck,
maybe it's a little bit of both.

144
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.840
You wouldn't think much of it if things didn't go the way they did.
You know,

145
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:26.760
late life.
And I used to have this conversation a lot.

146
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:31.761
I mean you don't know when things are going to go wrong and and seriously you

147
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.920
can be on the battlefield and you can,
you can say,
hey,

148
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:38.700
everyone go left and everyone goes left and everything turns out great.

149
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.390
Or you can say everyone would go right and everyone go right and everyone thing

150
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.283
turns out great.

151
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.490
If you go left and you happen to go to where the enemy was waiting in ambush for

152
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:51.060
you to go,
now you're,
you're,
you just made a bad tactical call.
The,

153
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.670
the thing that made it a bad town halls at the enemy happened to be there.

154
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.900
You couldn't know that.
Gotcha.
And if you'd have been,
if you'd said go right,

155
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.210
you'd made the greatest call ever because the enemy was over there waiting for,

156
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.990
again,
you don't know where the enemy is going to,
you don't have that luxury.

157
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.400
So sometimes you make the best tactical decision you can make and it turns out

158
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:12.000
bad.
Now we can look back at this hindsight being 2020 of course,
and,

159
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.470
and critique what's about to happen.
So we'll,
we'll,

160
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.410
we'll talk a little bit more about it.
Here's what goes down.
Back to the book,

161
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.540
Captain George Forest to commander of Alpha Company,

162
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:25.020
First Battalion Fifth Cavalry was more than 500 yards to the rear.

163
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:29.130
So these guys are in a long column of March Group of people.

164
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.510
Mcdade asked all the company commanders to come forward.

165
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.790
So McDaid is the company,
is the battalion commander.

166
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:38.430
And he tells all the companies commanders to come forward.

167
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.090
So he's McDade up at the front of this column and who knows how big they are.

168
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.930
You know,
he says he's 500 yards to rebut this pole thing probably spanned out

169
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.610
probably six 700 maybe even 800 meters.

170
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.420
We're getting close to a kilometer in length of people to spread out.

171
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.780
Just so everyone understands.

172
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.670
It's hard to control 40 guys in a,

173
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:06.710
in a line of March with any kind of control that spread out over 200 meters.

174
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.130
That's challenging.

175
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:13.310
You get 500 600 guys spread out over almost a kilometer.

176
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.470
We have a serious command and control issue.

177
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.040
So now what he's doing to overcome this issue is telling all the,

178
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.860
all the company commanders,
so there's three companies that are out there.

179
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.030
Actually there's more than that,
but there's multiple companies out there.

180
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.190
He tells all the company commanders,
Hey,

181
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:32.430
come to my position at the front of this thing so we can talk about what's

182
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:36.090
happening.
Back to the book,
Captain Fez Meyer,

183
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.770
the Charlie company commander,

184
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:42.771
was also moving up the count column to toward McDade position with him or his

185
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:48.000
two radio operators,
his artillery artillery,
Forward Observer,

186
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.290
Lieutenant Sydney Smith,

187
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.440
and his radio men as well as for first Franklin Hanse.

188
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.480
So,
so I want you to think about that or let me explain this to you a little bit

189
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:02.140
more.
Here's the Charlie company commander.
He's moving forward.

190
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:07.141
So he's leaving his company and with him he brings his two radio operators.

191
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.940
Hmm.
So who does that leave with a company?

192
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.200
There might be one platoon guy left that's a radio operator,

193
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.850
maybe one in each platoon.
But there,
there's,
he's pulling the,

194
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.080
the communications node out of the company right there.

195
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.230
He brings forward his artillery observer.

196
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.720
So this is the guy that's going to be able to place artillery.

197
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.350
Other guys can pick up the slack,
but not as well as this guy can do it.
Uh,

198
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.340
he brings Lieutenant Sydney Smith and his radio men.
So that means that,
so sorry,

199
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.560
the artillery observer is Lieutenant City Smith,

200
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:43.720
but that guy brings his radio mint as well.

201
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.600
So there's another guy out of the loop.
And then the first sergeant,

202
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.990
the company First Sergeant.
So now that's the leadership.

203
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.380
The company leadership is now from,
from Charlie company has now gone.

204
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.540
They're moving up forward to talk about it.

205
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:03.010
And so here,
uh,
they give a kind of an overview of what's going on.

206
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.630
Here it is.
This is what,
back to the book.
This is what was happening.

207
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.270
Sudanese Alpha company was moving forward toward the Albany clearing.
So they've,

208
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.780
they've now approached,
they're kind of approached this,
this Lz Albany.

209
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.070
That's what they're talking about.
The Albany clearing,
um,
Alpha company.

210
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.760
The genie's Alpha company was moving toward the Albany clearing.

211
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.210
Colonel Mcdade and his battalion command group were with Alpha Company.

212
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:31.490
The other company commanders had left their companies under orders and we're

213
00:13:31.491 --> 00:13:34.550
moving up to join MCDADE for a conference.

214
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.970
So the other company commanders are not with their companies anymore.

215
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.110
The battalion was strung out along the line of March for a distance of at least

216
00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:44.990
550 yards.
So half a kilometer.

217
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.790
The men of Delta company,
we're lolling around on the ground.

218
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.570
Charlie company had flankers off to each side,
but we're mostly taking a break,

219
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.830
a sitting or lying down.
George Forrest's men at the tail of the column,

220
00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.190
we're in a wedge formation and also had flank security posted.

221
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.930
The Metta battalion were worn out after nearly 60 hours without sleep and four

222
00:14:05.931 --> 00:14:10.370
hours of marching through difficult terrain visibility in the chest,

223
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:13.370
high elephant grass.
Was it very limited.

224
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

225
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.250
<v 0>Bad situation to be in.</v>

226
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.553
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

227
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.220
<v 0>Here's Lieutenant Gwinn talking.
We had been there a short time,</v>

228
00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:27.340
five minutes when I heard some rounds fired near our first platoon.

229
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.490
I thought they must have caught up with those Nva stragglers.

230
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:36.010
Then everything opened up,
opened up the firing,
just crescendoed.

231
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.420
They hadn't found the stragglers.
They had run right into the north Vietnamese.

232
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.390
I was out in the grass away from the trees when it started.

233
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.940
The rounds were so fast and furious overhead,

234
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:50.830
they were knocking bark off the trees.
I ran to them one round,
struck the tree.

235
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:54.710
I was crouched next to an inch over my head.
I said,
Holy Shit,

236
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:58.670
and ran to join Joel.
We all got down.
Then I heard this sickening.

237
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:03.290
Womp of mortar fire landing where I had seen our second platoon disappear.

238
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:06.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.530
<v 0>The most savage one day battle of the Vietnam War had just begun.</v>

240
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:11.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

241
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.620
<v 0>The second battalion,
seventh cavalry had walked into a Hornet's nest.</v>

242
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.570
The North Vietnamese reserve force,
the 550 man,

243
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.530
eighth battalion,

244
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:26.531
66 regimen had been bivouacked in the woods off to the northeast of MC dates

245
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:27.494
column.

246
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.150
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

247
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.170
<v 0>so you've got fresh soldiers that had been waiting.
They were the reserves.</v>

248
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.230
That whole earlier battle and the,
I drank with the one seven Cav,

249
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.890
this,
this Vietnamese group,
the 66 regimen,

250
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.920
eighth battalion 1666 regimen had been waiting in reserve and now they just so

251
00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:50.150
happened to be in the line of March where these were the two with a two five is

252
00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:50.984
coming through.

253
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

254
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.770
<v 0>Or sorry,
the two seven is coming through.</v>

255
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.580
Here's what Colonel Anne who,
again,
this was the Vietnamese commander.

256
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.630
Here's what he had to said.

257
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.250
Say I think this fight of November 17th was the most important of the entire

258
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:12.200
campaign.
I gave the order to my battalions.
When you meet the Americans,

259
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.760
divide yourself into many groups and attack the column from all directions and

260
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:19.100
divide the column into as many pieces.

261
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.780
<v 1>Okay?</v>

262
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.280
<v 0>Move inside the column,</v>

263
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:27.550
grabbed them by the belt and thus avoid casualties from the artillery and air.

264
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.420
<v 0>We had some advantages.
Now let me just talk about that one real quick.
Okay.</v>

266
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:36.440
Two things.
First of all,
get the battalion split up right,

267
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.670
and if you here,

268
00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:40.850
and I always talk about the common theme of keeping things together,

269
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:42.230
keeping people consolidated,

270
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:44.390
keeping your groups where they can mutually support each other.

271
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.010
His goal is the opposite of that.

272
00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:48.890
Get them split up so they can't support each other.
That's number one.

273
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.690
So contrary to that,

274
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.140
what you should always be doing as a leader is trying to keep your forces as

275
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:55.940
consolidated as possible so that they can,

276
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.230
they can maneuver well together and most important support each other to cover

277
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:04.700
and move.
Now the second part of this is move inside the column,

278
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.720
grabbed them by the belt and thus avoid casualties from artillery and air.

279
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.330
That's something that we still see to this day.

280
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.150
We talked about it with the Cheshin conflict.

281
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:19.150
That was the Chechens mode of Operandi modus operandi to take to get inside and

282
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:22.670
be right next to the Russians.
They called it hugging.

283
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:26.270
They would get in there and and get in the same building as the Russians so you

284
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:28.910
can't call fire on your own building,
so that's what the,

285
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.700
that's what the Vietnamese were trying to do.
Now,

286
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:34.520
what's beautiful about these statements,
think about these two statements.

287
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.150
This is beautiful commander's intent.

288
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.530
Here's all I want you to do.
Split them up,
get close to him.

289
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.200
That's what I want you to do.
He's not saying how to do it.

290
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:47.930
He's not telling each individual group would where to move and what to do.

291
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.070
He is and split them up

292
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.720
<v 3>and get close to them and stay close to him.</v>

293
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.350
This is gives the guys on the battlefield incredible flexibility to execute that

294
00:17:58.081 --> 00:17:58.914
plan.

295
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.400
Back to the book we had some advantages is on continuing.
We had some advantages.

296
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.720
We attacked your column from the sides at the moment of attack.

297
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.370
We were waiting for you.

298
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.240
This was our reserve battalion and they were just waiting for their turn.

299
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.090
The eight battalion had not been used in fighting in this campaign.

300
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:23.270
They were fresh Spec for Dick Ackerman was the right flank point man in the

301
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:27.030
recon platoon,
which was itself.

302
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.340
The point of the battalion says Ackerman,

303
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.620
we were going to the left to a clearing.

304
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.770
We had gone about a hundred feet when we heard some shots,

305
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.070
then more shots and finally all hell broke loose.

306
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.000
The main brunt of the attack was right where we had been standing.

307
00:18:42.001 --> 00:18:44.760
Just a few minutes before we hit the dirt.

308
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.930
I was laying in the middle of a clearing and bullets were kicking dirt in my

309
00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:51.690
eyes and breaking off the grass.

310
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.080
Ackerman's first sergeant was standing,
shouting and giving directions.

311
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.360
His shirt was off and he was in a tee shirt.

312
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.840
He lifted his left arm to point and I could see where a bullet had ripped him,

313
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.170
ripped open the side of his arm and part of the side of his chest.

314
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.600
He was still giving orders.

315
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.990
We were then ordered to another part of the circle that was weak.

316
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.490
It was facing the main area of attack.
There were people running everywhere.

317
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.090
We couldn't just open fire in that direction because our guys were there.

318
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.900
We were on semiautomatic and picking off whoever we could be sure of as a

319
00:19:25.941 --> 00:19:26.774
target.

320
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.980
<v 1>Okay,</v>

321
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:32.450
<v 3>so this just turns into he'll go immediately into chaos.
And again,</v>

322
00:19:32.451 --> 00:19:37.310
this is why consolidation of your forces is so important because the minute you

323
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:40.310
have an enemy in between you and other friendly forces,

324
00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:43.400
your field of fire is completely shut off and you're unlikely when you're,

325
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.570
when you are pulling the trigger,

326
00:19:44.571 --> 00:19:47.780
you have a good chance that you're going to shoot some of your own guys.

327
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.740
So that's what again,
why consolidations of forces is very,
very important.

328
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.430
Now I say this all the time,
I'll make the caveat again.

329
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.500
Are there times where you can get away with,

330
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.950
with splitting your forces and there's other times that it makes sense of?
Yes,

331
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.761
absolutely.

332
00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:05.240
There are times that it makes sense and we did all kinds of operations overseas

333
00:20:05.241 --> 00:20:08.660
where we had different units out on the battlefield that were split up and

334
00:20:08.661 --> 00:20:11.060
maneuvering from different areas we did all the time.

335
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.000
But you have to know and understand the risks.

336
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.340
You have to know and understand the risks of splitting forces of having enemy in

337
00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:23.390
between of trying to consolidate back together,
which is very,
very difficult.

338
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.560
You just have to really think about what the risks are and how you can mitigate

339
00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:30.170
those risks.
Sometimes you can do it with a terrain feature.

340
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.870
You can put guys in a certain area where,
hey,

341
00:20:32.871 --> 00:20:37.310
I have free fire because you're down behind a knoll or urine a ravine where I

342
00:20:37.311 --> 00:20:39.640
know that I can't shoot you that.

343
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.660
That's the type of thing that you can do to mitigate,

344
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.170
but it is something that people think they can get away with and you know,

345
00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:48.100
matter of fact we were doing

346
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.210
<v 0>FTX sure.
And it was interesting.
We had one of the,</v>

347
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:55.390
one of the females during the planning phase,

348
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.900
we have in plan just a a a couple operations just to sort of get used to

349
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:06.280
planning before we start the actual FTX.
This is for those who don't know.

350
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.820
We have a company called echelon front and sometimes we do field training

351
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:12.040
exercises with the companies we're working with.

352
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:16.540
To get them took to help instill in them the fundamental

353
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.690
principles of combat leadership.
So it was funny this,
this one female,

354
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.640
she had come up with this plan and they were going to enter this target building

355
00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:29.680
from two different directions and tell him about the classroom,

356
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:35.080
the classroom portion of the day before.
And she actually,
I said,
well,
you know,

357
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:38.320
we've said keep it simple and it can be a little bit confusing if you start

358
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:42.640
entering a building from two different sides and you're now you've got guns

359
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:45.370
pointed at each other and you know,

360
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:48.580
you've got to be careful that you don't shoot each other.
And,

361
00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.950
and she literally said,

362
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.420
I just don't see how it's going to happen that we could go into this building

363
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:58.540
and we're just going to start shooting each other.
Yeah,
of course.

364
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

365
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.320
<v 0>I smiled on the inside and said,
okay.
And,</v>

366
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.330
and literally the next day during the FTX phase of the training,

367
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.600
which we're using,
uh,

368
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.730
air soft weapons and you're shooting at bad guys,

369
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.400
they came up with a plan,

370
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.140
entered a building from two sides and she entered the building and literally

371
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:26.340
shot one of her own people.
She did exactly what she didn't think could happen.

372
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.950
And that's what people have to understand.
Now you might think,

373
00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:33.270
oh well it's this girl or this female.
And she was,
she's not a military person.

374
00:22:33.271 --> 00:22:36.150
And it's,
you know,
that's why it happened.
No,

375
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.320
I saw seals do it on the regular,
you're all hyped up.

376
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.250
You go in that room,
you see a person moving crack,
crack him,

377
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.540
fire a couple of shots,
and then you realize what happened.
So,

378
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.300
so that's what's going on here.
Split forces.
Things are going crazy.

379
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.130
Now here we go.
Ackerman's back to the book.

380
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.870
Ackerman's recompile tune leader lieutenant pain.
He says,

381
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.010
all hell broke loose up along the north side of the ELC.

382
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.960
I turned to my right and observe some American soldiers moving toward the

383
00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:13.410
northwest to set up positions and they went down in a hail of bullets.

384
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.150
Within minutes we were all under heavy attack and my radio operator and I were

385
00:23:18.151 --> 00:23:22.170
pinned down in the middle of the Lz with the most of the fire with most of the

386
00:23:22.171 --> 00:23:25.830
fire coming from the north and northwest lieutenant pains.

387
00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:29.940
Radio Opera came alive as the Alpha Company platoon leaders reported heavy

388
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.120
fighting pain says mortar rounds began falling,

389
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:37.260
which was a new experience to everyone since we had never had any kind of mortar

390
00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:41.040
fire against us.
The noise level was unbelievable.

391
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.700
I remember pressing my body flatter against the ground than I have ever been in

392
00:23:44.701 --> 00:23:49.701
my life and thinking that certainly the highest thing sticking up where my heels

393
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.130
mortars continue to fall in small arms and machine gun fire continued at a

394
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:57.320
hectic pace.
Finally,

395
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.240
my mind seemed to adjust and I once again began to think about the situation we

396
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:04.310
were in and what we were going to do.

397
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.850
So you see there's a leader he's pinned down,
and this was something that,

398
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:11.180
that the insurgents in Iraq would do as well.

399
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.360
They're going to hit you with multiple different weapons systems,
you know,

400
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.210
in a combined coordinated attack.
So if you can imagine,

401
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.230
if you start hitting people with mortars,
well everyone needs to get down.

402
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.281
You need to get down,

403
00:24:22.281 --> 00:24:27.170
you need to take cover while you're taking cover that cover.
They're gonna move,

404
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.200
they're going to maneuver in,
they're gonna maneuver in with with heavy weapons,

405
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:32.000
or they're going to move,
maneuver him with an assault squad,

406
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:34.550
or they're going to maneuver in with a vehicle borne IED.

407
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:37.550
So this is same thing happening here as you're getting mortared,

408
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:40.070
which these guys aren't used to,
which they're not,

409
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:42.260
that there's that much you can do to get used to it,
cause it doesn't matter.

410
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.820
It doesn't help you defend it.
You can be used to it.

411
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:45.590
You still have to get down and you still have to take cover.

412
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.820
These guys are taking cover.

413
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:55.090
And what I found interesting about this was you can see in his mind for a couple

414
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.640
seconds,
maybe 30 seconds,
he's just going,
holy crap.
I'm going to die.

415
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.940
And then finally he says,
my mind seemed to adjust and once again he'd be in.

416
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.300
Think about the situation we were in,
in what we're going to do now.

417
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:07.400
This is where combat experience is helpful.

418
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.530
If you haven't been in this situation before,

419
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.430
it's going to take you a few seconds to adapt and be like,
Oh Dang,

420
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:17.000
I need to do something.
If you haven't been in that situation before,

421
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.300
you could end up with some your,
it's going to take you some time to Justin,

422
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:22.340
it's like we talk about with self defense,
what Jujitsu.

423
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.390
If you've never been grabbed before and you've never been ground on before,

424
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:31.190
you've never had an humble,
someone pulled you before.

425
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.540
It's your mindset takes time just to get through that before you even start

426
00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:37.610
thinking about actually defending yourself,
you're just getting used.

427
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.440
You're just saying a whole crap.
Why is this happening?

428
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.750
However you train all the time.
Then you're used to it.
You Go,
oh,
okay.

429
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:46.310
Someone's got me.
Here's what I'm gonna do to get out.

430
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.990
Same thing with getting punched in the face.

431
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:51.320
If you've never been punched in the face before,
it takes some getting used to.

432
00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.930
You're going to get punched three,
four,
five times before.
You're like,

433
00:25:53.931 --> 00:25:58.280
wait a second.
I needed to defend myself.
If you've been punched before,
boom,
oh,

434
00:25:58.281 --> 00:26:01.400
I just got punched.
Here's my reaction.
Here's what I'm going to do,
and you'll,

435
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:05.000
speaking of Jujitsu,
going back to getting inside,
that's the same thing.

436
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.040
Getting close to someone.
What they were trying to do,

437
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.190
what the North Vietnamese were trying to do.
Get close,
stay close.

438
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.240
That's the same thing that you did too,

439
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:14.810
is you're trying to avoid the big punches.
You get in close,
you stay close,

440
00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:17.780
you keep the person close to you.
That's how you avoid getting knocked out.

441
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.520
Same thing,
so train,
train hard.

442
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:29.000
Back to the book.
Alpha companies Alpha,
the Alpha Alpha Company's commander,

443
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.200
Captain [inaudible] Jeanie's was in the trees headed to where he had seen the

444
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:37.370
battalion command group disappear.
Just as I noticed a small clearing up ahead.

445
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:41.180
I heard one or two shots to my rear back where my first and second platoons
were.

446
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.350
I looked back,

447
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:47.310
there was a pause of several seconds and then slowly all hell began to break

448
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:51.030
loose.
I remember we were reading the book

449
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.890
<v 1>okay.</v>

450
00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:58.150
<v 0>By Ernie Pyle and he talked about the expression all hell broke loose because</v>

451
00:26:58.151 --> 00:27:00.080
we've,
we just heard it like five times.
Yeah.

452
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.310
And he's talking about how it gets overused,

453
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:08.290
but it's real and you can tell what these guys,
it's just absolutely real.

454
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.390
That all hell is breaking loose.

455
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.070
I don't want to say this too because I didn't mention this about Dade Mcdade

456
00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:18.040
who's the battalion commander.
Mcdaid is the battalion commander.

457
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.330
He had just taken over the battalion like a few weeks before and he had moved

458
00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:27.080
from some admin position inside the inside the,
the,

459
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.170
the,
I don't know if it was inside the battalion or inside the brigade,

460
00:27:32.171 --> 00:27:36.280
but he had moved from like a sort of an administrative position into battalion

461
00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:38.020
command.
Hmm.
So in other words,

462
00:27:38.021 --> 00:27:41.500
he wasn't charged of in charge of any troops and then all of a sudden he was in

463
00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:43.960
charge of troops.
And then three weeks later they're going into combat.

464
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.520
Now that being said,

465
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.890
he also said that this guy hadn't been in charge of any troops in like 10 years.

466
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.240
So he,
he,

467
00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:57.160
he had apparently done his platoon commander and his company commander in World

468
00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.670
War two and Korea.
So McDaid is an experienced combat leader,

469
00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.770
but he's out of practice.
Yeah.

470
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.660
He's out of practice and more probably more important or just as important to to

471
00:28:07.661 --> 00:28:09.550
being out of practice is he just took over.

472
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.240
So part of being a battalion commander is that you train and prepare your troops

473
00:28:16.181 --> 00:28:19.660
for combat.
You get to know all your man.
You get to understand their weaknesses.

474
00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:23.290
You just can't jump in and take over and all of a sudden have the knowledge that

475
00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:25.120
you would have if you were preparing everyone.

476
00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:29.020
That's why training is so important.
That's why we train.
Yeah.
So if you are,

477
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:34.000
if you are not given the opportunity to train and learn your troops,

478
00:28:34.001 --> 00:28:36.130
you're at a huge disadvantage.

479
00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.240
You're an and you haven't had time to train them up to the year standards.

480
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.260
You know,
this guy was in World War II and Korea.
He understands combat.

481
00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.710
And so to think that he wouldn't put his guys through a,
you know,

482
00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:51.400
a certain level of training to get them up to speed and make sure they do things

483
00:28:51.401 --> 00:28:53.810
like,
like make sure that there's uh,
uh,

484
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.880
other people in the chain of command that can step up and lead having a

485
00:28:57.881 --> 00:29:00.970
succession plan.
So,
so like him calling people forward,

486
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.740
maybe if he had trained the battalion,

487
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.170
but he knew that there was other guys in there that we'll be able to take
charge.

488
00:29:05.171 --> 00:29:06.730
He didn't realize that there wasn't like a little,

489
00:29:06.731 --> 00:29:10.170
a little hesitation there that was going to happen,
which is what happens.
Yeah.

490
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.610
So he doesn't know his,
his team well enough.
Yeah.

491
00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.190
For this situation.
And that's not good.

492
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.833
<v 1>No.</v>

493
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.560
<v 0>Back to the book captain suit.
Jeanie's says Larry,</v>

494
00:29:26.561 --> 00:29:29.980
Gwen and I hit the edge of Albany on the northeast side of the clearing.

495
00:29:29.981 --> 00:29:32.560
As the column began to receive intense fire,

496
00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.900
we began receive sporadic sniper fire.

497
00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.290
Part of the [inaudible] had already reached the island and the island that

498
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:42.040
they're talking about is there like an island of of woods,
an island of trees.

499
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.410
I yelled across the opening for someone to cover us.

500
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.120
We ran to the island at this point.

501
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:49.360
I called my first and second platoon's on the radio almost immediately.

502
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:51.550
I lost communications with first platoon.

503
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.050
The platoon sergeant for the second platoon came on the radio.

504
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.210
That was Sergeant First Class William,
a feral 38 from Stanton,

505
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:02.044
Tennessee.

506
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.410
He was a veteran of world war two and Korea had been a prisoner of war in Korea

507
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.420
and could have chosen to remain in the states.

508
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:15.700
He did not have to deploy with Vietnam with us.
Everyone called him.

509
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.713
Pappy.

510
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.670
Pharaoh kept asking captain [inaudible] where he was telling him that they were

511
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:25.390
mixed up with the north Vietnamese and had several wounded and killed.

512
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.180
I couldn't pinpoint his location.

513
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.750
I knew where he should have been directly east of our island,

514
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.560
pappy then radio that he was hit that there were three or four men with him all

515
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:41.860
hit.
I could hear the firing at his location over the radio.

516
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.290
I never heard from pappy again.
He did not survive.

517
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.493
<v 2>Okay.</v>

518
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.740
<v 0>This confusion that happens is Fargo war stuff.
Yeah.
This is,</v>

519
00:30:56.741 --> 00:31:00.730
this is complete fog of war stuff and by the way,
the enemy gets a vote.

520
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.830
The enemy gets a vote.
The enemy can do things like this that you don't expect.

521
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:07.570
The enemy can hit you from multiple sides.

522
00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:11.050
The enemy can have a strategy or a tactic to getting close.

523
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.430
That's what the enemy's going to do.

524
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

525
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.980
<v 0>You don't know what the enemy's going to do actually.</v>

526
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.360
You don't know what they're gonna do.

527
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.880
You don't know that we're going to have mortars this time.

528
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.033
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

529
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.391
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

530
00:31:26.391 --> 00:31:30.230
Lieutenant Colonel Mcdade himself recalls when things began happening,

531
00:31:30.231 --> 00:31:32.990
I got in with Alpha company.
I know.

532
00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:37.130
I was trying to figure out what was going on.
I moved very fast.

533
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.220
Let's get over there in those trees and let's all get together.

534
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.670
The enemy seem to be all over the woods.

535
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:49.760
We had good tight control in the immediate area and we're trying to figure out

536
00:31:49.761 --> 00:31:51.620
where everybody else was.

537
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.570
One of the things I was very concerned with was people being trigger happy and

538
00:31:56.571 --> 00:31:58.730
just shooting up the grass.
I was telling them,

539
00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.120
make sure you know what you are shooting at because we are scattered.

540
00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.750
So notice how he says this.

541
00:32:05.751 --> 00:32:08.480
We had good tight control in the immediate area and we're trying to figure out

542
00:32:08.481 --> 00:32:11.060
where everyone else is.
This is horrible.

543
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.110
It shows you two things when you have good tight control over people,

544
00:32:15.111 --> 00:32:18.050
you're okay.
Yeah.
If you know where your people are,
your okay.

545
00:32:18.051 --> 00:32:23.051
There's one of the worst feelings on the battlefield is not knowing where your

546
00:32:23.511 --> 00:32:27.920
guys are.
That is one of the worst feelings on the battlefield,

547
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.720
not knowing where your guys are

548
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.610
and sitting there trying to figure out where everyone else is,

549
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.710
which I guess those two are the same things and so the biggest concern he has

550
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:42.410
right now,
he's like,
he's so concerned about friendly fire.

551
00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:43.563
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

552
00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.170
<v 0>Keep control of your people.</v>

553
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.660
Back to the book.
The battalion operations officer,

554
00:32:52.661 --> 00:32:54.610
captain spires believes that the,

555
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.660
the fact that the commanders were absent from their companies when the fight

556
00:32:58.661 --> 00:33:02.850
started contributed to the confusion,
it had the most effect.

557
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.180
I think on Charlie company,
their commander,

558
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.530
Captain Skip Fest Meyer was up with us and Don Cornet,

559
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:13.860
the Charlie company executive officer was killed early on,

560
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.730
so they had no commander and they just disintegrated.

561
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.810
So leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

562
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.180
Talk about that all the time.
This is why,

563
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.360
this is why when you see a platoon or a company that doesn't have any

564
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.920
leadership,
they fall apart.
Now,

565
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.420
if you are well trained and if you have a good succession plan and if you've

566
00:33:37.421 --> 00:33:39.970
done drills where the company commander gets killed and you take them out and

567
00:33:39.971 --> 00:33:42.070
other people have to step up and lead,
yes,

568
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.440
that is how you prepare for these situations.

569
00:33:44.441 --> 00:33:46.240
You have to prepare for those situations.

570
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.400
You have to prepare for leaders to go down.

571
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:49.403
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

572
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.190
<v 0>But if you have no one that steps up,</v>

573
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.970
you're going to be in a real hard way.
Real fast.

574
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.833
Back to the book.

575
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.820
The entire area was now alive with North Vietnamese soldiers who had obviously

576
00:34:05.821 --> 00:34:07.920
cut through the battalion's line of March,

577
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.590
severing the head of the battalion from the body.

578
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.050
Gwyn saw three Gi gis coming through the high grass running from the area

579
00:34:16.051 --> 00:34:20.130
swarming with enemy.
I jumped up and screamed to them,

580
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.700
waving my arm.
They saw me and headed directly to our position.

581
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.170
The first man was a captain,

582
00:34:25.171 --> 00:34:28.350
our air force forward air controller who is completely spent.

583
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.920
I pointed out the Battalion Command Group,
which was huddled to our rear at the,

584
00:34:31.921 --> 00:34:34.290
at another ant hill and he crawled toward them.

585
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:38.070
He was followed by the Battalion Sergeant Major Jim Scott,

586
00:34:38.071 --> 00:34:41.730
who dropped down next to me and Scott was followed by a young,

587
00:34:41.731 --> 00:34:46.731
very small PFC who is delirious and holding his guts in with his hands.

588
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.690
He kept asking,
are the helicopters coming?
I said,
yes.
Hang on.

589
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.550
The battalion commander initially thought that the incoming rounds were all

590
00:34:59.551 --> 00:35:02.970
friendly fire.
So think about that.

591
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.380
The battalion commander on initially fought that the incoming rounds were all

592
00:35:07.381 --> 00:35:09.960
friendly fire.
So what's his reaction?
Take cover.
Don't wish you back.

593
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:10.883
<v 2>Mm.</v>

594
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:15.420
<v 0>Which is actually,
if you're getting maneuvered on by an enemy,</v>

595
00:35:15.421 --> 00:35:18.960
the worst possible thing you can do is take cover and not shoot back cause that

596
00:35:18.961 --> 00:35:21.510
means the enemy's gonna maneuver faster on you.
Back to the book,

597
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:25.650
he had been hollering for all of us to cease fire and the word went out over the

598
00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:27.540
command net,
but to no avail.

599
00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:31.050
As the troops on the perimeter could see north Vietnamese,

600
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.620
can you imagine the confusion?

601
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.710
You've got the battalion commander on command that yelling to everyone to cease

602
00:35:38.711 --> 00:35:41.700
fire and meanwhile you can literally see North Vietnamese and you're shooting in

603
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:45.870
engaging them.
This is me,
this is may him.
The sergeant major,

604
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.780
Major and I were looking to the rear.
When I heard a loud blast,

605
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.030
the sergeant major yelled,
I'm hit.

606
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.660
He had taken a round in the back under his armpit and there was a large hole

607
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:55.770
underneath his right arm.

608
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.820
I told him he would be okay to bandage it himself.

609
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.550
This he did ripping off his shirt.

610
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.110
Then he picked up his m 16 and headed back to one of the ant hills.

611
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:11.220
I saw the sergeant major a few times after that and he was fighting like a demon

612
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.590
sergeant major.
Scott says,
I took a bullet through my chest,

613
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.870
not more than 15 or 20 minutes into the battle.

614
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:23.130
I could see enemy soldiers to our left right and front in the in platoon and

615
00:36:23.131 --> 00:36:24.480
company size elements.

616
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:29.670
They were up in trees up on top of ant hills and in the high grass.

617
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.700
We weren't exactly organized.
We didn't have time.

618
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.650
Everything happened all at once.

619
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.580
I didn't see a d a hole being dug up prior to 8:00 PM that night.

620
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.090
We did use the trees and ant hills for cover within a half an hour.

621
00:36:43.091 --> 00:36:46.350
There was an attempt to organize groups in two defensive position in the company

622
00:36:46.351 --> 00:36:50.970
area.
Individuals did this.
No one in particular.

623
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.730
I think that's what saved us.

624
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.870
So this is decentralized command coming at you.

625
00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:01.650
The only thing that gets them together is that individuals stepped up and said,

626
00:37:01.651 --> 00:37:06.270
okay,
we need a former perimeter defense.
Now,
unfortunately a half an hour,

627
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:10.320
an hour had already passed when they got to this point where the individual

628
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:14.160
start making the call.
The other thing is there's a lack of overall direction,

629
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.470
so you get to a point where if everyone knew,
hey,

630
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.510
here's what the position we're going to be in the battalion.

631
00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:24.330
Here's our formation.
If something happens,
here's what we're going to do.

632
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:25.870
We're going to bound towards this area.
You,

633
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:29.550
there's all kinds of contingency plans that could have been done here.
No.
Again,

634
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.310
I'm doing hindsight 2020 which I hate doing,

635
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:38.450
but we are trying to learn and we are trying to talk to all the military people

636
00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:43.560
that are listening that are out doing operations right now.
Think about this,

637
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.440
and I had this,
I probably told the story before,
but when we first got to Ramadi,

638
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.700
my one of the junior officers was taking a patrol out and it was a patrol

639
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:02.280
combined patrol with some Iraqi soldiers and some seals and he was going over

640
00:38:02.281 --> 00:38:07.170
their patrol route with me and he got to this big open field and he said,
yeah,

641
00:38:07.171 --> 00:38:07.591
then where to go?

642
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:09.600
We have to go across this field because it's the only way to get from here to

643
00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:11.940
there.
And I said,
well,
what are you going to do when you get to the open field?

644
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.680
And he said,
well,
we're just gonna get across it.

645
00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.620
It was how are you gonna get across it?
And he said,
well,

646
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:18.450
we're going to walk across it.
I said,
what if you get hit?

647
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.200
And he didn't really have an answer.
I said,
okay,
so here's what you're gonna do.

648
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.240
Leave some guys in the tree line over here.

649
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.690
Have these guys bound across to this little dyke right here.

650
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.350
Then those guys can join him.
Cover,
move,
just cover,
move across this field.

651
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.830
And that's what they did.
And sure enough,
they actually got hit.

652
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.820
They got hit with a pretty significant attack and uh,

653
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.860
with mortars and small arms fire and they covered,
moved out of the situation.

654
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.730
But my point is looking at the terrain beforehand,

655
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.120
having a plan and the next cute in the plan and dictating this situation you're

656
00:38:49.121 --> 00:38:52.390
going to be in instead of letting the,
the situation dictate what happens to you.

657
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.030
Don't do that.
It's not a good answer.
Situation dictates.
That's not a good,

658
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:01.600
we dictate this situation.
Hmm.
Talked about it before

659
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.800
and then have your,

660
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.900
like the Vietnamese command was very broad.
The commander's intent.
Get close.

661
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.780
Split them up.
These guys didn't have a command like that.

662
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.710
What could the opposite?
Command a big bed stick together.

663
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.940
Stick together.
Keep integrity.
Well,
there you go.

664
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.240
Don't let them in clothes.
Okay.
There you go.

665
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.343
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

666
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:31.810
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

667
00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:36.930
Sue genies and Gwyn art agree that it was not long after this.

668
00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.450
The Alpha,

669
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.860
the commander of Alpha Company's Missing Second Platoon Lieutenant Gordon Groves

670
00:39:40.861 --> 00:39:44.680
staggered into the American position from the east.
Here's Larry Gwynne talking.

671
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:49.090
I saw Gordon Gordy grove coming across the field along with two wounded men.

672
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.260
They were the only ones left of his platoon who could move.

673
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:59.060
Grove was distraught.
We got him and his two men with us and our God,

674
00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.820
our medics working on the wounded.

675
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.720
Then Gordy asked for men to go back with him to get his people.

676
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.660
Joel should Dinis said,
Gordy,

677
00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:10.600
I can't send anybody about [inaudible] back out there.

678
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.890
It was clear that to leave this perimeter was deaf.

679
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.140
Everywhere you looked,

680
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:21.010
you could see north Vietnamese Gordy asked permission to go talk to the

681
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:25.240
battalion commander.
So Jeannie said,
go ahead.
He jogged over,

682
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.590
asked Mcdade for help to go get his men got a negative response.

683
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.450
So he came back to our anthill.

684
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:32.930
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

685
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.420
<v 0>so this is one of those classic examples you hear about all the time.</v>

686
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.850
People will try and get you in the,
uh,

687
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.740
the catch 22 question,
like the Gotcha question.
Well,

688
00:40:42.741 --> 00:40:45.200
what would you do if you were in the situation and,
and you,

689
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.640
some of your guys were still out there,

690
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.130
but you didn't have enough people to go get him or you were being overwhelmed.

691
00:40:49.131 --> 00:40:52.520
What would you do?
Well,
here's what these guys did right here.
They're like,
no,

692
00:40:52.521 --> 00:40:54.830
you can't go get them.
Are you sending more people out there?

693
00:40:54.831 --> 00:40:58.730
They're going to die if they die.
If we send 10 guys out there,
15 guys out there,

694
00:40:58.731 --> 00:41:01.430
18 guys out there to go recover this plan,
we're going to lose 18 more guys.

695
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.980
We're going to stay put where to fight as best we can.
From here.

696
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.230
We'll get fire superiority back,

697
00:41:06.231 --> 00:41:09.830
we'll get our shit together and then we'll go get these guys

698
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.451
Gwyn ads.

699
00:41:14.451 --> 00:41:18.050
There was a tremendous battle going on in the vicinity of where we had come into

700
00:41:18.051 --> 00:41:20.450
the clearing and beyond.
They're in the jungle.

701
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:25.400
He was Charlie company caught in the killing zone of the ambush fighting for its

702
00:41:25.401 --> 00:41:28.100
life.
The mortar fire had ceased.

703
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:32.060
The enemy tubes apparently had been overrun by Charlie company B because we

704
00:41:32.061 --> 00:41:33.980
found them all the next,
but

705
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.910
<v 3>there were still hundreds of north Vietnamese calmly walking around the area we</v>

706
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:42.500
were observing now began the sniping phase of our battle.

707
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.790
I call it that because for a long period of time all we did was pick off enemy

708
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:50.210
wandering around our perimeter and this lasted until we started getting air

709
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:51.044
support.

710
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:55.670
Everything that had happened to this point had probably taken less than 30

711
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:56.504
minutes.

712
00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:00.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

713
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.090
<v 3>Gwyn saw major Frank Henry,</v>

714
00:42:03.091 --> 00:42:05.880
the battalion executive officer lying on his back using the radio,

715
00:42:05.881 --> 00:42:09.150
trying desperately to get some tactical air support and succeeding.

716
00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:10.770
The air was on the way,

717
00:42:10.771 --> 00:42:15.360
but there was no artillery or aerial rocket artillery yet Jim spires,

718
00:42:15.361 --> 00:42:20.361
the s three ran over to us and query Gordon Grove Gordy Grove as the situation

719
00:42:21.991 --> 00:42:25.140
outside the perimeter where he had just come from Grove,

720
00:42:25.141 --> 00:42:28.380
told them they were still met out there,
tightened into a small perimeter,

721
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.190
but they were all wounded and dying in the radios,
had all been knocked out.

722
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:37.050
Captain spires asked a second time if you thought anyone was still alive and

723
00:42:37.051 --> 00:42:38.550
none of us said anything.

724
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:44.230
Gwen climbed a top a termite hill and began sniping at the north Vietnamese

725
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.070
visible across the clearing in the trees to the south with Zm 16 rifle.

726
00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.470
There were plenty of targets and I remember picking off 10 or 15 NVA from my

727
00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:54.304
position.

728
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.070
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

729
00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:59.180
<v 3>My memories revolve around the way in which each enemy soldier felt that I hit.</v>

730
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:02.720
Some would simply limp slump limply to the ground.

731
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.330
Some reacted as if they had been hit by a truck.

732
00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.700
Some that I missed on the first and second shots kept on milling around until I

733
00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:11.540
finally hit them.

734
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.960
What we did not know at the time was that they were wandering around the

735
00:43:15.961 --> 00:43:20.400
elephant grass looking for Americans who were still alive and killing them off.

736
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:21.750
One by one

737
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.670
north Vietnamese soldiers climbed into trees and on top of those brush covered

738
00:43:30.671 --> 00:43:34.150
termite hills and poured fire down on the cavalry troops.

739
00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:38.140
Troopers trapped in the tall grass below them.
In the main body of the column,

740
00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:43.600
there was serious firing,
including mortar fire from both sides.

741
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.890
The strike at the head of the column was followed so quickly by the enemy and

742
00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:52.270
circling assaults that the whole business seemed to erupt almost simultaneously.

743
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.380
<v 1>Okay?</v>

744
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.161
<v 3>Without doubt.</v>

745
00:43:55.161 --> 00:44:00.161
Some of some platoons of metates battalion were alert and in as secure a

746
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:05.630
formation as they could achieve in the elephant grass brush and thick scrub

747
00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:06.464
trees.

748
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.910
But the visibility problem made it difficult to maintain formation and one

749
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:14.900
result was that American troop for close to one another then was tactically

750
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:19.040
sound providing juicy grenade,
juicy targets for a grenade,

751
00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:21.980
mortar round or a burst from AK 47 rifle.

752
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:23.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

753
00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.770
<v 3>All down the column,
platoon leaders,
sergeants,</v>

754
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.030
radio operators and riflemen by the dozens were killed or wounded.

755
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.010
The first 10

756
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.930
<v 0>minutes rapidly degrading communication,
cohesion and control</v>

757
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.210
to this whole thing that we've talked about up to this point was like a half an

758
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:46.460
hour,
just a brutal on swap.

759
00:44:46.461 --> 00:44:50.060
That debt kicked off with massive violence of action.

760
00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.020
Captain Fez Meijer ads.

761
00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:59.380
The result was very intense individual hand to hand combat in the confusion.

762
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:05.330
I had no idea exactly where the company was located.

763
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.430
When lieutenant cornet died,

764
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.060
it was virtually impossible for me to talk to anyone in my company.

765
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:17.290
The battle had clearly become an individual struggle for life.

766
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:23.910
Again,

767
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:28.910
that was the goal of the Vietnamese was to make it an individual struggle was to

768
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:29.881
get in close,

769
00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:34.881
was to separate people from the main battalion to split it up into as many parts

770
00:45:35.371 --> 00:45:37.710
as possible so they could pick it apart.

771
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.310
Spec for Jack Smith who was in Charlie company had been a radio operator until

772
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:48.360
about a week or so before this operation when he was shifted to a supply clerks

773
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:49.194
job.

774
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.370
The events of November 17 are etched on his mind.

775
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:56.400
Smith's company commander,
Captain Fas Meyer,

776
00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:00.600
had like the other has been called to the front by Lieutenant Colonel Mcdade.

777
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.370
Subsequently,

778
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.700
many people pointed to this as a major error and in light of what has happened,

779
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:12.150
it was the firing began to roll on all around us.

780
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.040
The executive officer of my company,
a man called Dawn Cornet,

781
00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.310
a very fine officer,

782
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:22.110
jumped up and in the best style of the infantry school yelled,
follow me.

783
00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:23.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

784
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:27.440
<v 0>Elements of our first and second platoon's ran right towards a series of ant</v>

785
00:46:27.441 --> 00:46:27.980
hills.

786
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:32.450
Within 10 feet of them we saw where the machine gunners behind them firing point

787
00:46:32.451 --> 00:46:33.350
blank at us.

788
00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.300
Men all around me began to fall like mown grass.

789
00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:41.300
I had never seen people killed before.

790
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.330
They began to drop like flies and die right in front of me.

791
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:46.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

792
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.400
<v 0>These were the only friends I had and they were dying all around me.</v>

793
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.240
Private First Class,

794
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.520
James H Schaden was in Forbes,

795
00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:06.320
Delta company,
mortar platoon.

796
00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.120
The intensity of the fire increased to the point where Shannon couldn't hear

797
00:47:11.121 --> 00:47:12.950
anything but weapons firing.

798
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:14.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

799
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.340
<v 0>And here's what he says.
Tone Johnson came crawling with me,</v>

800
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.380
hitting the cheek and the back of the hand.

801
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:23.460
The trees were full of north Vietnamese,
but spotting one was almost impossible.

802
00:47:23.461 --> 00:47:28.410
They blended in so well.
I kept raising up to try and detect a good target.

803
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.040
Matthew Shelton,
who was laying

804
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.270
<v 3>next to me,
kept jerky me down.
As I raised up again,</v>

805
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:37.180
a bullet pierced my helmet straight through front to back.

806
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:42.190
I went down again and came back and the,
and as I came back up,

807
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:45.700
a bullet struck the tree beside my head from behind.

808
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.950
I don't know where,
if we were surrounded or it was our own men,

809
00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:55.200
they were firing wild.
Anything that moved,
somebody shot at it.

810
00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:00.240
One trooper crawled up next to me shooting through the grass a few inches off

811
00:48:00.241 --> 00:48:04.320
the ground toward where our own people lay.
Never thinking what he was doing.

812
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.900
I told him to be sure he knew what he was shooting at.

813
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.000
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

814
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
<v 3>the firing eventually began to slack off shad and has no idea how much time</v>

815
00:48:14.911 --> 00:48:18.450
elapsed.
There was no way to keep track of time and a fight like this.

816
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:20.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

817
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:25.310
<v 3>Men were wounded and dead all in the area.
Six were alive that I know of.</v>

818
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:29.480
Sergeant Tyler,
Pfc Carter,
Pfc Johnson,

819
00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.990
Pfc Shelton,
Pfc cones,
and myself.

820
00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:39.160
Tyler gave the only her order I heard during the entire fight try to pull back

821
00:48:40.461 --> 00:48:42.290
before they finish us off.

822
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:44.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

823
00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.990
<v 3>Shelton froze to the ground and would not move.</v>

824
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.330
The five of us proceeded to try and pull back with the snipers were still in the

825
00:48:52.331 --> 00:48:55.240
trees.
Soon I was hitting the right shoulder,

826
00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:57.640
which for a time rendered it useless.

827
00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:02.710
Tyler was hitting the neck about the same time he died an arm's length from me

828
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.240
begging for the medic Spec for William,
pleasant,
who is already dead.

829
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:10.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

830
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.240
<v 3>The last words Tyler ever spoke.
War.
I'm dying.</v>

831
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:15.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

832
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.660
<v 3>Sergeant Tyler 35 was from Columbia,</v>

833
00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:20.530
South Carolina.

834
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.810
The helplessness I felt is beyond description.

835
00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.190
Within a few minutes I was hit again in the left knee.

836
00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:33.890
The pain was unbearable.

837
00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:35.670
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

838
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.740
<v 3>Colin's who's hit in the feet and ankle.</v>

839
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:43.740
We were wounded and trapped.
I could see we were getting wiped out.

840
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

841
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.900
<v 3>A buddy helped me bandage my leg.</v>

842
00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.510
He got the bandage off a dead Vietnamese.

843
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.660
I got behind a log and there was a Vietnamese,
they're busted up and dead.

844
00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:02.190
This was behind us.
So I knew we were surrounded.

845
00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:11.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

846
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.820
<v 3>It's
for me,</v>

847
00:50:14.821 --> 00:50:18.180
it's crazy to think these are Americans to really is,
you know,
it's,

848
00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:21.860
it's crazy to think you,
you always think naive.

849
00:50:21.861 --> 00:50:26.280
We sold that Americans have the upper hand all the time,
but you know,

850
00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:29.150
here you are.
You do.
You don't,

851
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:31.580
you don't always have the upper hand.

852
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.503
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

853
00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.120
<v 3>Has,
she hadn't,
continues on.</v>

854
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:43.140
It appears as if the ground was opening up and swallowing the mortar men.

855
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.870
They say they fell so fast.
Uh,

856
00:50:45.871 --> 00:50:50.160
Brown wave of death rolled over them and on into Charlie company,

857
00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.560
Vietnamese intermixed with them.

858
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:58.010
Then reality set in the enemy held ground beyond the outhill.

859
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.090
The column was cut in half.

860
00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:01.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

861
00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.880
<v 3>Incoming fire drew our attention back to the tree line.</v>

862
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:08.530
The firing increased rapidly.
We returned fire at muzzle flashes.

863
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:12.400
I heard an explosion behind me turning.
I saw Chai,
calm grenades,

864
00:51:12.401 --> 00:51:15.250
landing all flash and smoke,
no casualties.

865
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:19.990
The volume of fire became almost unendurable bullets,

866
00:51:19.991 --> 00:51:23.380
peeled bark from trees,
vegetation disintegrated.

867
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:28.660
I look to Lieutenant James Lawrence for help saw as high his head violently

868
00:51:28.661 --> 00:51:30.850
recoil.
He hit the ground.

869
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:40.650
Here's another description back to the book.

870
00:51:40.651 --> 00:51:44.430
Here's what the Vietnam War looked like in the afternoon of November 17th

871
00:51:44.431 --> 00:51:48.600
through the eyes of two of Captain Forest Alpha company rifleman,

872
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.840
Pfc David,
a Perp,

873
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.270
lavender of Murphysboro,

874
00:51:54.271 --> 00:51:58.260
Illinois and Spec for James Young of Steelville,

875
00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.860
Missouri says lavender.
My platoon was bringing up the rear.

876
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

877
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:06.650
<v 3>We started to maneuver and work our way up the column to help those ahead.</v>

878
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.520
Every time we made a move,
we were hit by mortars.

879
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.750
It was something you can't describe.
People were dropping like flies.

880
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:19.850
The first blast killed a young soldier named Locatelli.

881
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:22.970
Every time we move,
they'd drop mortars on us.

882
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.720
I know we must have had 12 or 15 wounded out of our platoon,

883
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:28.190
including our platoon leader.

884
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:33.050
These were my buddies I had been with in the army for two years.

885
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:38.000
The majority of our whole battalion had been drafted at age 21 and had been the

886
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:39.800
service for over 18 months.

887
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:43.130
All of us were nearly 23 years old,

888
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:44.480
<v 1>okay.</v>

889
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:49.370
<v 3>Debbie came my brothers,
over time
hearing these fellows scream,</v>

890
00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:53.240
hearing them killed,
stuck in my heart and mind ever since.

891
00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.570
The most critical part of this flight was the beginning.

892
00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:01.390
It was the surprise.

893
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.210
They had us in a u shaped ambush

894
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:09.460
and they had us cutoff with mortars,

895
00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:16.170
surprise and violence of action,
surprise and violence of action.

896
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:20.860
Two key elements of firefights.

897
00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.960
And here's what young said the other,

898
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.060
the other individual introduced a moment ago,

899
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:32.850
there was a grassy field to my left 25 or 30 yards and a sniper off on my right.

900
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:37.590
I couldn't see him,
but I saw a tracer bullet go across my hand,

901
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.910
<v 1>okay?</v>

902
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:41.040
<v 3>I felt the wind of that bullet.</v>

903
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.000
The same bullet passed over the back of Smith's neck.

904
00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.590
He was lucky he had his head down.
Our company commander,

905
00:53:49.591 --> 00:53:51.570
Captain Forest came running along our line.

906
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:54.150
He was stopping and telling everybody where to go.

907
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.670
He acted as though he was immune to enemy fire.

908
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.830
I don't know how he kept from getting hit.

909
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:03.843
<v 1>Okay,</v>

910
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.790
<v 3>so captain forest stepping up and leading and what's</v>

911
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.360
things do not happen without leadership so you,

912
00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:17.970
unless he gets up and makes these things happen,
they are not going to happen.

913
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.940
That's what you do as a leader.
You have to make things happen.

914
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.430
Talk about it all the time.
There is an example of it.

915
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.930
Things do not happen unless you make them happen.

916
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:33.373
<v 1>Now,</v>

917
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:39.390
<v 3>if you remember that oftentimes in Vietnam there would be a command and control</v>

918
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:43.890
helicopter and we talked about this on one oh five where the brigade commander

919
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:46.620
actually came and landed for a little bit and then left.

920
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.840
Well that was Colonel Tim Brown and here we have a little section with talking

921
00:54:51.841 --> 00:54:53.910
about what,
what's going on with him.
Back to the book,

922
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:57.790
Colonel Tim Brown's helicopter was running low on fuel and the chopper had to

923
00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:02.460
return to refuel.
Brown says,
I knew they weren't a contact.

924
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.940
I did not know how severe or anything else while I was talking to Mcdade,

925
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:11.250
I could hear rifle fire,
but he didn't know what was happening.

926
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.090
I asked what happened to your lead unit?

927
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.510
He didn't know where's your trailing units?

928
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:23.600
He didn't know and he didn't know what happened to any of the rest of them.

929
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:26.370
Nobody knew what the hell was going on.

930
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.850
We were not in a position to shoot a bunch of artillery or airstrikes in there

931
00:55:29.851 --> 00:55:31.800
because we didn't know where to put them.

932
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:33.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

933
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:38.180
<v 3>Only now that Colonel Brown began rounding up reinforcements to send in to help</v>

934
00:55:38.181 --> 00:55:40.700
Bob Beck dates.
Second Battalion.

935
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:43.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

936
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.480
<v 3>Did you notice what he wants to know is where people are?
Hmm.
That that's,</v>

937
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.080
you've heard me talk about this before.

938
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:53.820
I used to ask the you dumb junior officers,

939
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:56.520
what's the most important piece of information you can have on the battlefield

940
00:55:56.521 --> 00:55:58.110
and they'd sail where the enemy is and how,

941
00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.380
how many there are and what kind of weapons there are and know the most

942
00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:04.200
important piece of information there is on the battlefield is where you are.

943
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:07.020
And I actually tell the same thing to businesses because sometimes business is

944
00:56:07.021 --> 00:56:09.060
don't know where they are because they're not tracking what they're doing.

945
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:10.510
So you're asking him,
hey,

946
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:13.170
where are you and you're in your p and l and your profit and loss.

947
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.560
They don't know.
You ask him where they're doing the nurse,

948
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.980
how were their sales performance is?
They don't know,
well,

949
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:22.830
how are we going to make any changes?
You need to know where you are.

950
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.100
Most

951
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.750
<v 0>important piece of information there is,</v>

952
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:32.280
here's McDade talking again,

953
00:56:32.281 --> 00:56:35.250
this is the kernel or the battalion commander,

954
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:39.720
Lieutenant Colonel in charge on the ground.
In that first hour or so,

955
00:56:39.721 --> 00:56:42.630
the situation was so fluid that I was acting more as a platoon leader.

956
00:56:42.631 --> 00:56:46.440
Then a battalion commander,
that's a flag red flag,
right?
You're acting.

957
00:56:46.441 --> 00:56:50.160
If you're acting as a platoon leader and you're in charge of a platoon is 40

958
00:56:50.161 --> 00:56:50.994
guys,

959
00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:55.860
a battalion is 500 600 and he's acting as a platoon leader who's running the

960
00:56:55.861 --> 00:57:00.090
battalion.
We were trying to secure a perimeter.

961
00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.700
I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on myself.

962
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.730
I don't think anybody in the battalion could have told you what the situation

963
00:57:05.731 --> 00:57:06.900
really was at that time.

964
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.190
I can see where this might have left Tim Brown.

965
00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.860
The brigade commander in the dark about what was going on.

966
00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.440
I didn't know myself until things quieted down.

967
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:19.230
The Battalion Commander ads,

968
00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:22.950
I could have yelled and screamed that we were in a death trap and all that crap,

969
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.530
but I didn't know it was as bad as it was.

970
00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:30.000
I had no way of checking visually or physically by getting out of that
perimeter,

971
00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:34.830
so all I could do is hope to get back in touch.
I wasn't going to screen that.

972
00:57:34.831 --> 00:57:38.670
The Sky was falling and especially in a situation where nobody could do anything

973
00:57:38.671 --> 00:57:39.630
about it anyways,

974
00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:48.550
so if you don't know what's going on,

975
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:51.660
that means there's a bad problem that that that's,

976
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:56.730
that's my assessment and also it's also if you,

977
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.790
I'm not trying to say that you should cry wolf because you shouldn't,

978
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:05.910
but when things are going sideways,

979
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:08.580
<v 2>okay,</v>

980
00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:11.490
<v 0>you can wait for them to develop.
If you have a great grip of what's happening,</v>

981
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:13.260
if you don't know what's happening,

982
00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:17.130
you better spend some people up to come help you at least get him spinning.

983
00:58:17.131 --> 00:58:18.150
At least get them turning.

984
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:22.140
That happens a lot where the guy on the ground might not fully understand what's

985
00:58:22.141 --> 00:58:26.340
happening.
Make the call and say,
Hey,
I need,
I stand by it or support,
stand by,

986
00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:29.130
get QRF spun up,
you know you make those calls.

987
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:33.240
That doesn't mean send to anybody but get them ready,
get them closer,

988
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.580
get them on standby QRF,
quick reaction force.

989
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:37.620
So if I'm on the ground all of a sudden are getting shot at from multiple

990
00:58:37.621 --> 00:58:40.140
different directions.
I'm not really sure what's happening.

991
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.720
I might not say send the QRF but I'll say,

992
00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.050
hey have the QRF move to position Alpha,

993
00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:51.300
which is very close to where I am in case I do need them in 15 minutes or and a

994
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.690
half an hour or an hour or right now I've at least made that progression.

995
00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:00.120
Is that like for just provide some general awareness?
Yeah,

996
00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.990
so you're QRF quick reaction force.
They might be,

997
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.660
they might be 30 minutes away and they might need 15 minutes of notification

998
00:59:09.661 --> 00:59:12.690
time.
Yeah.
Does that means if you called them right now,

999
00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:17.670
they're going to be here in 45 minutes,
45 minutes from bad firefight.

1000
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:18.533
Is not going to help you.

1001
00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:23.480
So your first call now you might bring them in and you preplan this.

1002
00:59:23.481 --> 00:59:26.000
This is when I talk about pre planning.
We would always preplanned,
hey,

1003
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:28.430
if we need QRF,
we're going to call you to this point here.

1004
00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:31.380
We'll call you to this point here.
If we need to bring you on on standby,

1005
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.750
we'll call you to this point.

1006
00:59:32.751 --> 00:59:35.690
Let's say this point is 500 meters away from where we actually are.
Yeah,

1007
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.860
and then we have one that's right where we are like you come to this building,

1008
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:41.570
if we call queue or after you come to this building,

1009
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.850
we're going to try and get into that building.

1010
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.830
If you don't hear from us and we just called for QRF,

1011
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.210
come to that building will be inside it.

1012
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:50.010
The best of our ability as they get closer,

1013
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:52.310
hopefully you can establish communications with them directly,

1014
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:56.690
but if you start losing control of the situation,
this is the thing.

1015
00:59:56.691 --> 00:59:59.270
When you start losing control of the situation,

1016
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:04.820
you call it the QRF and say hey,
move to the staging point.
So now they're moving.

1017
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:08.870
You Do,
you started that 45 minute clock right now they've all spun up.

1018
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:09.980
They're all getting in their vehicles.

1019
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.260
They woken up to the people that need to get out,

1020
01:00:12.261 --> 01:00:13.550
they get in their vehicles and they drive.

1021
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:18.200
So now they might get to the 500 meters away and I had the situation under

1022
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:21.380
control and I say,
hey,
we don't know if you come in,
we're okay.

1023
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.530
Hold off on what you got there.
Bombed.
But they don't care.

1024
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:29.000
They'd rather have that because maybe in 30 minutes things that develop to a

1025
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:31.850
point where I need them and now they can get there in 15 minutes instead of in

1026
01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:35.210
45 yeah.
Okay.
So again,

1027
01:00:35.211 --> 01:00:37.480
we're not trying to spin up and waste assets,
right.

1028
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:40.580
But in and actually know who did this,
a very similar in the,

1029
01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:43.430
in the previous podcast,
the guy that called broken Arrow,

1030
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:46.030
which means troops are about to be overrun.
He didn't wait for anyone to tell me,

1031
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.200
he just called it.
He's like k broken Arrow now.

1032
01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:50.070
It takes some time for those guys to show up there.

1033
01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:51.470
And by the time they got there,
they needed him.

1034
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.730
Similar thing.
Now.

1035
01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:01.760
Yeah,
they don't advocate yelling or screaming.

1036
01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.600
Sometimes you might have to though,
you know,

1037
01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:06.940
you might need to get that information and people aren't paying attention.

1038
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.401
What you're saying,

1039
01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:10.630
it can be impactful if you've ever been sitting in and it's in its operation

1040
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.000
center where you hear people yelling,
it gets attention because most,

1041
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:16.280
most military guys don't yell and scream for no reason.

1042
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.420
They're yelling and screaming cause there's,

1043
01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:18.830
there's a reason why they're yelling and screaming.

1044
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.843
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1045
01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:28.000
<v 0>Don't recommend it.
I don't recommend it,
but I've heard it.</v>

1046
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.260
You know,
I prefer the comm guys.
If you've got to yell and scream,

1047
01:01:32.261 --> 01:01:34.780
then calm down and talk about what you actually need.

1048
01:01:34.781 --> 01:01:36.460
You can't just continue to yell and scream because you'll,

1049
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.550
you won't get through clear communication.

1050
01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:44.630
You'll come Austin office too emotional and you know,

1051
01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:47.980
you just become hard to understand when you're screaming and yelling,
calm down,

1052
01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:52.330
get their attention,
give simple,
clear,
concise direction of what you want.

1053
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:56.470
Back to the book,
each and every man's still alive on that field.

1054
01:01:56.471 --> 01:02:00.610
American and North Vietnamese was fighting for his life in the tall grass.

1055
01:02:00.611 --> 01:02:03.940
It was nearly impossible for the soldiers if either side to identify friend or

1056
01:02:03.941 --> 01:02:08.941
fro accepted extremely close range Americans and all of drab and north

1057
01:02:10.001 --> 01:02:13.660
Vietnamese in mustard.
Brown were fighting and dying side by side.

1058
01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.160
It may have begun as a meeting engagement.
A hasty ambush or surprise attacked

1059
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.760
<v 3>a battle of maneuver and in fact it was all those things.</v>

1060
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:28.560
But within minutes the result was a wild may lay a shootout with just

1061
01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.460
gunfighters killing not only the enemy,
not only the enemy,

1062
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:35.220
but sometimes their friends just a few feet away.

1063
01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:40.620
There would be no cheap victory here this day for either side.

1064
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.810
There would be no victory at all.

1065
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.390
Just the horrible certainty of death in the tall grass.

1066
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.510
<v 1>Unbelievable,
horrible,</v>

1067
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:58.583
horrible.

1068
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.220
<v 3>Back to the book,
just forward of the headquarters section of the column.</v>

1069
01:03:03.221 --> 01:03:05.170
Charlie company was beginning to die.

1070
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:10.890
Charlie Company's talking about Charlie Company.
A whole company meant 150 guys.

1071
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.880
Spec for Jack Smith was with the lead elements in,

1072
01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.620
in the Charlie company formation,
nearly tenant.
Dawn Cornet,

1073
01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.000
the acting company commander.

1074
01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:23.730
When the company charged into the teeth of the enemy machine guns.

1075
01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:24.690
In the first seconds,

1076
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:28.680
Smith saw one of the radio operators fall dead with a bullet through his chest,

1077
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.480
his eyes and tongue of bulging out.
The men of Charlie company,

1078
01:03:33.481 --> 01:03:35.160
we're firing in all directions.

1079
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.610
Smith recalls within a span of perhaps 20 minutes,

1080
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:42.090
every one around me was dead or wounded except me.

1081
01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:48.350
You have to understand that in our area,
the elephant grass was chest high.

1082
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:52.850
Once you hit the dirt,
your world was about as big as a dining room table.

1083
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:54.090
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1084
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:58.920
<v 3>Your world's completely confined to that area and the six or seven men around</v>

1085
01:03:58.921 --> 01:03:59.754
you.

1086
01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:00.440
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1087
01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:03.050
<v 3>At that point,
we were isolated.</v>

1088
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:08.030
Alpha company was in the same shape.
Then the north Vietnamese swept through,

1089
01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.990
I believe they came between Alpha and our company began to shoot people.

1090
01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.400
We didn't know if the noise was from five feet away.
As they began to shoot,

1091
01:04:16.401 --> 01:04:18.830
people was friendly or enemy.

1092
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.193
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1093
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:27.140
<v 3>Smith saw soldiers take machine guns lie flat on the ground to begin firing into</v>

1094
01:04:27.141 --> 01:04:27.974
the grass.

1095
01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:32.600
Often they were firing right into the muscles of other American machine guns.

1096
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:34.970
People were screaming to stop the shooting.

1097
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:38.090
It began to have all the elements of a massacre.

1098
01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:39.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1099
01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:44.560
<v 3>Nobody was in control because all the officers were to the front and our radio</v>

1100
01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:47.920
operators had fallen dead on their radio sets.

1101
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:50.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1102
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:55.500
<v 3>No leadership,
no communication.
You know,</v>

1103
01:04:55.501 --> 01:04:58.110
I talked to businesses and I explained this to my,
there's your point.

1104
01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.120
You hear it is loud and clear.

1105
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.610
Tell these businesses where I go and talk to businesses,

1106
01:05:02.611 --> 01:05:04.440
they talk about this problem and that problem.
The other problem,

1107
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.570
the problem is leadership.
That's what the problem is.

1108
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:07.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1109
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:08.580
<v 3>The problem is leadership.</v>

1110
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:11.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1111
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.270
<v 3>And this situation like this where the leaders are not there to lead.</v>

1112
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:19.150
You've got serious problems on your hands,
especially once again,

1113
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:22.960
if you haven't trained people to lead to step up and lead when the leader's
gone.

1114
01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.170
Hmm.
If you haven't trained people to do that,
you're going to have problems.

1115
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:28.090
No one is going to lead

1116
01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:40.820
back to the book.
Pain fought the north Vietnamese had done a match,

1117
01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:44.700
much jet or better job of anticipating and preparing for the attack,

1118
01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:50.090
but the Americans who survived the initial onslaught began to rally in one

1119
01:05:50.191 --> 01:05:52.470
respect.
You could think of it as little little big horn.

1120
01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:57.240
We were surrounded with our pacs in front of us shooting it out during the

1121
01:05:57.241 --> 01:06:01.830
course of that long afternoon,
I never saw a soldier not do his duty.

1122
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I never saw anyone who cowered in the face of the enemy.

1123
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:07.230
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1124
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:10.440
<v 3>Our backs were against the wall and it was a matter of survival.</v>

1125
01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.840
Every person I saw rose to the occasion,

1126
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:17.520
so this is the American troopers are doing what American troopers do.

1127
01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:18.383
Fight

1128
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.460
even in these terrible situation.
No one cowers.
No one stands down

1129
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.150
back to the book.
Shortly after word of the command came over,

1130
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:33.010
the battalion net throw smoke.

1131
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:37.150
Lieutenant Gwinn moved a little away into the grass and the men in Albany

1132
01:06:37.151 --> 01:06:42.130
perimeter all began to throw smoke grenades.
I saw skip fas,
Meyer,

1133
01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.410
Charlie company commander throwing smoke.

1134
01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.650
I had no idea what the hell he was doing up here.

1135
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.010
Our perimeter was marked with colors,
with all colors of smoke,

1136
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:55.330
delineating our positions and shortly after the air strike started,

1137
01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:01.900
they were the,
they were a one e sky Raiders with napalm.

1138
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.270
The first napalm canisters fell right at the point where some genius and I had

1139
01:07:07.271 --> 01:07:09.160
left the jungle and came into the clearing.

1140
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:13.510
We could see masses of North Vietnamese on the other side.
I was sure.

1141
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.970
I was very sure they were going to come across at us.

1142
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:19.330
I think they were cleaning up over there,
shooting down at the ground,

1143
01:07:19.331 --> 01:07:20.740
dispatching our wounded.

1144
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:25.030
That first strike was right on target with two napalm cans.

1145
01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.800
I saw them hit the tops of the trees and jellied napalm was coming down through

1146
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:31.750
the limbs and the Nva were jumping,

1147
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:34.720
trying to get away and being engulfed in flames.

1148
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:38.010
I saw that time and time again.

1149
01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:44.320
Lieutenant Gwinn remembers a cleaned out swath after swath,

1150
01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:48.880
those fuckers would jump up and try to run.
They didn't make it by now.

1151
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:51.850
The Americans were cheering and laughing at each strike.

1152
01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:55.390
The cheering stops when they dropped two canisters directly onto the position

1153
01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:58.600
where the remnants of the second platoon had been making their stand.

1154
01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.040
It might've been me,

1155
01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:05.510
but all I could hear was the cracking of unexpended rounds burning in the flames

1156
01:08:05.511 --> 01:08:07.100
that engulfed are men.

1157
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:13.560
None of us know if there were any alive at the time,

1158
01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.180
<v 1>but</v>

1159
01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.740
<v 3>none of us wanted to think about it.</v>

1160
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:35.100
Spec for Dick Ackerman of the reconstitution remembers our artillery was

1161
01:08:35.101 --> 01:08:38.310
supporting us so close that we would occasionally get some shrapnel.

1162
01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.220
There were planes flying,
close air support.

1163
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.620
We started digging in everywhere we could.

1164
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.160
My entrenching tool was attached to my pack,
left out in the clearing,

1165
01:08:47.161 --> 01:08:50.880
so I used my band at my fingers in someone else's tool when it was available.

1166
01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:56.650
The comfort of a trench just big enough to hold your body is unbelievable.

1167
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:02.390
No more than 200 yards away.
In that tortured column,
a desperate Americans,

1168
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:06.590
one man prayed for a miracle and the u s air force delivered it.

1169
01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:12.460
Pfc Jim Shaden Delta Company who had booby trapped his own body with a hand

1170
01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:17.660
grenade was badly wounded and unable,
unable to move.

1171
01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:21.730
He was directly in the path of a group of North Vietnamese soldiers,

1172
01:09:21.731 --> 01:09:25.120
methodically sweeping the ground,
killing his wounded buddies,

1173
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.740
and here's what he says.
Before the North Vietnamese got to me,

1174
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:34.310
half a dozen of them,
a pilot came over at tree top,

1175
01:09:34.311 --> 01:09:39.311
lever level turned straight up and drop the canister of napalm dead center on

1176
01:09:39.561 --> 01:09:42.370
them.
I never cease to be amazed,

1177
01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:47.490
amazed at the accuracy of that drop the heat of the napalm rolled across my face

1178
01:09:48.641 --> 01:09:51.370
and body like an open door on a furnace.

1179
01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:57.360
I owe this pilot more than it is possibly possible for a human to pay.

1180
01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:58.870
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1181
01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.180
<v 3>may God bless all pilots.</v>

1182
01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:13.060
Now we hear from Captain Abuse Tallies.
Bravo company.

1183
01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:15.120
First Battalion Fifth Cavalry was a,

1184
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:19.810
was assigned the mission of attacking to relieve the pressure and attempt to

1185
01:10:19.811 --> 01:10:24.811
link up with the beleaguered battalion ref reinforcements were also on the way

1186
01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:29.110
for the battalion command perimeter at the head of the column during the

1187
01:10:29.111 --> 01:10:32.560
afternoon.
Captain Myron to Derek's battle.

1188
01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:37.330
Wearied veterans of the fight at Atlantic zone x Ray Bravo company,

1189
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.530
second Battalion Seventh Cav guiding a warning to prepare for a night air

1190
01:10:41.531 --> 01:10:43.330
assault into a hot landing zone.

1191
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:49.850
The Bravo Company troopers delighted to have survived the hellish fighting on x

1192
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:54.380
ray and enjoying a well deserved rest and a lot of cold beer back at Camp

1193
01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:59.120
Holloway were stunned when they were told they were being thrown back into a

1194
01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.980
desperate situation.
So suddenly,

1195
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:05.981
so if you remembered to Derek from podcast one oh five from two seventies Bravo

1196
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:07.010
company to seven,

1197
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:12.070
they went in and helped turn the situation around at Lz x Ray.

1198
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.310
They fought hard

1199
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.340
<v 0>and then they got extracted and now they're getting told,
oh,</v>

1200
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:22.980
there's a bad situation going on again and we needed to put you back on back in,

1201
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:23.873
back on the flight.

1202
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:28.080
Back to the book specialist John Worldliness,

1203
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:35.340
Bravo company,
mortar observer was doing some serious celebrating.

1204
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.970
He had not only survived x ray without a scratch,
but this day,

1205
01:11:38.971 --> 01:11:43.650
November 18th was his birthday.
I was 22 years old.

1206
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:46.470
We were fed and showered.
New clothes were available.

1207
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:50.310
I spent the afternoon at the men's,
at the enlisted men's club,

1208
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.330
drinking beer with the platoon and exchanging stories and celebrating my

1209
01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:55.164
birthday.

1210
01:11:56.250 --> 01:12:00.360
Around 4:00 PM to Derek came in and told us to saddle up.

1211
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.550
We were going to rescue the battalion

1212
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.460
at about 1600 hours.
Lieutenant Rick Risk Score,

1213
01:12:08.461 --> 01:12:13.410
La recalls captain to Derek walked up,
get the company together.

1214
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.200
Battalions catching hell.
We may have to go in.

1215
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:20.580
You're the only platoon leader left and the company help all the platoons get

1216
01:12:20.581 --> 01:12:21.414
their shit together.

1217
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:26.040
Men spilled out to the clubs and double timed their equipment.

1218
01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.160
They worked quickly throwing on their harnesses.

1219
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:33.690
No protests but their eyes filled with disbelief again.

1220
01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.480
Did Derrick then issued the the shortest frag order and Bravo company history

1221
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:43.100
will be landing from the southeast.
Open fired.

1222
01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.300
Anything on your left run to your right.

1223
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:50.220
A hostile landing with one side of the landing zone held by the North Vietnamese

1224
01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:52.230
sit rep from the ground.

1225
01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:57.150
Grim expect to be sandwiched between friendly and enemy fires.

1226
01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1227
01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:03.540
<v 0>At about 5:45 PM rest score,
La gathered the platoons.</v>

1228
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:07.440
They Preston close listening intently for word

1229
01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.490
Sergeant First Class,
Allston,
Allston,

1230
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:15.710
the mortar platoon sergeant,

1231
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:21.310
Sergeant Staff Sergeant Martin Spec for Vincent Specialist Worldliness,

1232
01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:28.420
the towering sergeant leary Melton 80 or more young faces hollow wise.

1233
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:32.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1234
01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.580
<v 0>Do you know the battalion and is in the shit?</v>

1235
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:39.140
I said we have been selected to jump into that shit and pull them out.

1236
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:43.880
If you fight like you did an x ray,
you'll come through it.
Stay together.

1237
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:48.860
Come out of those choppers.
Ready to get it on across the field.

1238
01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:53.000
The first lift ships were sweeping in head them up captain to direct grout.

1239
01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:59.380
I turned and walked ahead Fantino trailing with the PRC 25 the road stretched

1240
01:14:00.441 --> 01:14:04.430
out past the permanent hooches of the rear echelon at Holloway.

1241
01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:08.270
Word spread that we were on a suicide fight.

1242
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:12.070
Tumbling out of cozy bunks.
Holloway's

1243
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:17.070
<v 3>finest line the road to watch us depart Hawaiian shirts,</v>

1244
01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:21.130
aviator shades,
genes,
beer cans in hands,

1245
01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.820
cooks and bottle washers.
The ship Burgers,

1246
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:28.930
Projectionists Club runners,
same army,

1247
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.820
different species.
The company picked up pace,

1248
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:36.130
a tight,
dirty brown column.

1249
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:40.540
A few of the men carried a k trophies from x-ray.

1250
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:45.940
No one had shaved noted risk score low,
but our weapons sparkled.

1251
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.760
What outfit are you?
One spectator asked the hardcore of Bravo company.

1252
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:56.050
Second of the seventh.
Where are you headed to kick ass?

1253
01:14:56.051 --> 01:15:00.850
I yelled back.
A deep rumble ran through the ranks.
Men Yelling,
cursing,

1254
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:05.950
not a man among us would swap places with these large asses.

1255
01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:11.950
As we passed,
I asked Fan Tino,
how are we looking back there?
His reply,

1256
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:15.700
no stragglers,
sir.
Every swinging Dick is with us.

1257
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:21.010
As we made a column right to the pickup point,
I looked back at our crew.

1258
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:26.320
No outfit in the army had ever rendered a route step any better than these men

1259
01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.154
at this moment.

1260
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.570
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1261
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:32.980
<v 3>We piled onto the Hueys without the usual loading instructions and skated away</v>

1262
01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:34.440
into the fading gray light.

1263
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:36.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1264
01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:41.600
<v 3>At 6:45 PM the first lift ships roared into the small Albany clearing and</v>

1265
01:15:42.601 --> 01:15:45.930
captain to Derek's troopers bailed out into the tall grass.

1266
01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:49.470
The cavalry had written to the rescue,

1267
01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:53.010
but the killing and dying and terror continue to,

1268
01:15:53.011 --> 01:15:57.660
I'm baited in outside the American perimeter as the long night began.

1269
01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.670
Once again,
that's the American soldier right there.
Barely survive.

1270
01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:12.820
X Ray get called to go back in and they pick up the pace.

1271
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:17.913
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1272
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.700
<v 3>back to the book captain to Derek Road of the flight in and the situation on the</v>

1273
01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:25.720
ground or assaulting Albany.
We picked up five bullet holes in the helicopter.

1274
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.800
Things were bad.

1275
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:30.130
I found out when I landed that the battalion was shot up pretty bad,

1276
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:32.110
so we came in the nick of time.

1277
01:16:32.111 --> 01:16:35.170
Did they rescue the main part of second battalion?

1278
01:16:35.171 --> 01:16:36.880
Seventh CAV was on their last ditch.

1279
01:16:36.881 --> 01:16:40.300
Standard Albany little big horn revisited

1280
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:46.540
and here's Russ score talking,
looking sideways.

1281
01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:50.290
I saw a trickle of blood down the pilot sleeve.
This is as they're flying in,

1282
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.950
the choppers dropped a few feet.
The pilot yelled at the gunner,

1283
01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:57.340
the gunner smelled.
Get Out.
I hesitated,
get the fuck out.

1284
01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.220
Four of us dropped the bone jarring 10 feet.

1285
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:05.870
Now inside the battalion command group,
perimeter rescue,

1286
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.850
Orla took stock and here's what he says.

1287
01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.170
The battalion sergeant major sat against a tree with a bandage chest.

1288
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:14.480
We got hit bad,
sir.
Real bad.

1289
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:19.700
The wounded were gathered 30 yards from the CP.
Only half my platoon had arrived.

1290
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:23.150
The other ships turn back because of the ground fire and darkness.

1291
01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:23.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1292
01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.640
<v 3>The perimeter was an oval island of trees.</v>

1293
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:28.530
Three platoons could man the perimeter,

1294
01:17:28.531 --> 01:17:31.990
but with the exception of our people and pat pains,
recompile tune,

1295
01:17:31.991 --> 01:17:33.690
there was no unit cohesion.

1296
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.110
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1297
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:38.200
<v 3>Colonel McDade slumped against a tree.
He looked exhausted.</v>

1298
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:41.480
He was exceptionally silent.
Major Frank Henry,

1299
01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:46.390
his executive officer was reassuringly active.
A short fireplug of a man.

1300
01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:50.790
Henry waved a welcome working the radios.
Captain Joe Price,

1301
01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:54.840
the fire support coordinated coordinator Crouch beside him.

1302
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:57.970
Clumps of survivors sprawled inside the perimeter,

1303
01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.040
including several company commanders.

1304
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1305
01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:05.040
<v 3>Lieutenant Larry.
Gwen watched the reinforcements arrived.</v>

1306
01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:09.570
I saw Rick risk score law come swaggering into our lines with a smile on his

1307
01:18:09.571 --> 01:18:14.571
face and [inaudible] on his shoulder and his m 16 in one hand saying,

1308
01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.780
good,
good,
good.
I hope they hit us with everything they've got tonight.

1309
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:23.430
We'll wipe them up.
His spirit was catching.

1310
01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:28.530
The troops were cheering as each load came in and we really raised a racket.

1311
01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:32.490
The enemy must have fought that an entire battalion was coming to help because

1312
01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:34.230
of all are screaming and yelling.

1313
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:37.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1314
01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:42.250
<v 3>Major Henry directed that.
I round up some men and police all the ammo resupply,</v>

1315
01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:44.800
which the choppers brought in on the last flight.

1316
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:46.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1317
01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:48.430
<v 3>He was lying in crates on the far side of the ELC.</v>

1318
01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:52.570
Somehow we got it all into the perimeter.
As I came back with the last load,

1319
01:18:52.571 --> 01:18:55.050
I passed right over the body of that North Vietnamese.

1320
01:18:55.051 --> 01:18:56.470
I'd killed early in the fight.

1321
01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:57.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1322
01:18:57.830 --> 01:19:00.740
<v 3>There wasn't much of him left and I didn't give a damn.</v>

1323
01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:03.923
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1324
01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:08.250
<v 3>so
I mean there you go.
There you see one.</v>

1325
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:12.540
One liter makes a difference.
One liter makes a difference here.

1326
01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:15.600
These guys are completely surrounded,
dead and wounded everywhere,

1327
01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:20.190
and Rick Ross score luck comes in and says,
good,
I hope they bring it tonight.

1328
01:19:20.191 --> 01:19:21.270
We'll wipe them out.

1329
01:19:24.730 --> 01:19:25.430
Back to the book.

1330
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:28.450
Lieutenant Pat paid of the [inaudible] tune was just as happy about the

1331
01:19:28.451 --> 01:19:29.650
reinforcements as Quinn.

1332
01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.620
We were all very surprised to see those helicopters come in.

1333
01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:35.970
We were only securing one side of the Lz,

1334
01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:38.910
so when the guys would jump off the helicopter,
we hollered at them,

1335
01:19:38.911 --> 01:19:39.780
which way to come.

1336
01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:40.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1337
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:44.870
<v 3>I had a feeling we'd actually been rescued that in the fact that the cavalry had</v>

1338
01:19:44.871 --> 01:19:46.550
arrived.
Just like in the movies,

1339
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:50.060
I admired the courage it took to land in Albany.

1340
01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:54.590
Lieutenant Rusk score was one of the best combat leaders I ever saw during two

1341
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:57.320
tours in Vietnam.
He walked around at pepped,

1342
01:19:57.321 --> 01:20:00.680
everyone up by telling them they've done a good job,
that there was support.

1343
01:20:00.681 --> 01:20:04.580
Now that things were under control,
he never raised his voice,

1344
01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:06.290
almost spoken of whisper.

1345
01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:11.160
We're awfully glad to see him and the others from Bravo company,

1346
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:16.230
well got in there and told everyone are you did a good job.

1347
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.630
Didn't get all negative.
Although he's actually,

1348
01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:23.730
and he talks about it and I think,
I think I'm going to cover it,

1349
01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:26.220
but he talks about what he was actually thinking was like,

1350
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:30.660
this is going to be really problematic.
In his mind,
he was thinking,
this is bad,

1351
01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.310
really bad,
but he didn't show that.
He showed,
hey,
we're good.
Bring it.

1352
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.200
You're,
you're,
you're good now.
Good job.
Get ready to get it on.

1353
01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:48.180
Talking a little bit about the,
the air support that they're getting.

1354
01:20:48.181 --> 01:20:51.810
Back to the book chief warrant officer Hank Ainsworth had been overhead in the

1355
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:55.260
second Battalion Command chopper all day and here's what he says.

1356
01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:59.190
I was overhead when the fight started in orbited overhead to late that night.

1357
01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.500
I was on a freak talking to major Frank Henry.
Later that evening,

1358
01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:08.010
he called me.
Henry said,
we have critically wounded down here.

1359
01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:09.900
If we don't get them out,
they're going to die.

1360
01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.230
I called Medivac and they came out,
made a pass,

1361
01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:16.950
drew fire and refuse to land to land.

1362
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:20.580
Frank Henry knew exactly what to do about that situation.

1363
01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:25.760
He told Hank Ainsworth to call the 229th Huey slicks the old reliables Ainsworth

1364
01:21:27.751 --> 01:21:32.130
notified the two 29th pilots told them that Lz Albany was hot,

1365
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:33.660
but that second battalion,

1366
01:21:33.661 --> 01:21:37.650
seventh cavalry had critically wounded men who would die if there were not

1367
01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:38.484
evacuated.

1368
01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:42.990
Says Ainsworth the whole damn unit volunteered.

1369
01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:48.800
I told them we only needed two ships despite Ainsworth's call for only two ships

1370
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:54.170
for Huey slicks lifted off from Camp Holloway Turkey farm at 9:50 PM for the 40

1371
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:55.410
minute flight to Albany.

1372
01:21:55.710 --> 01:22:00.270
Captain Bob Stinnette was again in the lead followed by a captain Bruce Thomas,

1373
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:05.040
Chief Warrant Officer Can Faba and Warren Officer Robert Mason,

1374
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.520
and here's what stinnette says.

1375
01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.820
Normally the Huey pilot's throttle back their engine to as soon as they touch

1376
01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:14.520
down to conserve fuel fuel.
Not Tonight.

1377
01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:20.080
Something told me not to do that,
to keep the engine turning at a full flight.

1378
01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.190
Rpms.

1379
01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.180
They told us the wounded war ambulatory when we got in there,

1380
01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.800
they were all stretched your cases,

1381
01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.400
my crew chief and Gunnar had to get out and raise the seats so we could get all

1382
01:22:30.401 --> 01:22:35.170
the stretchers in.
Then all hell broke.
Loose.
Fire was coming in from everywhere.

1383
01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:39.910
I immediately pitched.
I immediately pulled pitched and with the Rpms at flight,

1384
01:22:39.911 --> 01:22:43.750
the ship instantly jump 30 feet in the air and kept going up.

1385
01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:47.950
We went so fast that the crew chief and gunner got left behind on the ground and

1386
01:22:47.951 --> 01:22:52.210
I'd even know it.
We just flat left them.
We had the wounded inside.

1387
01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.360
When we got back,
we counted 30 holes in my machine.

1388
01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:57.700
That was enough for me and my Huey,

1389
01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:03.480
the lift of three that went in after dog after me took in medical stuff and

1390
01:23:03.821 --> 01:23:07.360
brought back more wounded and my crew major,

1391
01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:09.910
Frank Henry was on the flashlight at the time.

1392
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:16.030
Joel [inaudible] watched it with awes,
the brave aviators wrist,

1393
01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:17.830
everything for the wounded at Albany.

1394
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:20.950
I remember thinking they were the bravest pilots I'd ever seen.

1395
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:25.780
They were sitting docks and I fully expected to see them shot down at any
moment.

1396
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:29.920
They were guided in by Frank Henry.
You could see the tracers.

1397
01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:31.990
The aircraft didn't hesitate a bit.

1398
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:36.730
They landed loaded and we're gone in seconds.
So again,

1399
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:40.690
you see what w that's the American fighting spirit.
Oh,

1400
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.960
we got a hot LZ where we probably going to get shot down,

1401
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.870
but we've got wounded Americans on the ground.
We're going to get them.

1402
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:51.430
Everyone in the unit volunteers.
We only need two aircraft guests.

1403
01:23:51.431 --> 01:23:52.360
What we're bringing four.

1404
01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1405
01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:01.150
<v 3>Back to the book.
After midnight,</v>

1406
01:24:01.151 --> 01:24:03.340
several shots rang out from inside the perimeter,

1407
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:08.050
a trooper 20 yards behind risk score low inside the perimeter had rattled off a

1408
01:24:08.051 --> 01:24:10.600
panic.
He three rounds rest score low,

1409
01:24:10.601 --> 01:24:13.330
walked back and cost out the group in the middle of the perimeter.

1410
01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:17.410
If I hear one more round out to you,
we will turn our weapons around and open up.

1411
01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:22.450
No one fires from inside the perimeter.
If you want to fire out to the perimeter,

1412
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.810
if you want to fire,
get out to the perimeter line whispered.

1413
01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.930
Communication took place all night between isolated elements outside the

1414
01:24:28.931 --> 01:24:30.970
perimeter.
If there was heroism,

1415
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.840
it was out there in the tiny groups of wounded and those who had bandaged and

1416
01:24:34.841 --> 01:24:36.100
protected them through the night.

1417
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.270
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1418
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:41.380
<v 3>they were just like hunting buddies said Russ Korla surviving by instinct,</v>

1419
01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.760
looking out for each other.

1420
01:24:43.770 --> 01:24:44.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1421
01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.280
<v 3>Lieutenant Larry Gwyn of Alpha company recalls that late that night,</v>

1422
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.220
one of Alphas missing men crawled into the American perimeter.

1423
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:53.130
And here's what he says.
Sergeant James,

1424
01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:58.020
a Malarkey from our first platoon made it back to our lines,

1425
01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:02.430
his story.
The NVA had been shooting our wounded one came up to him,

1426
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:06.270
stuck a pistol in his mouth and fired the bullet,

1427
01:25:06.271 --> 01:25:08.910
exited through the back of his throat,
knocked him out,

1428
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:10.140
and they left him for dead.

1429
01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:11.450
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1430
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:15.860
<v 3>he survived.
And when he woke up that night,
he started crawling to us.</v>

1431
01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:20.333
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1432
01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:25.660
<v 3>The next day was a real nightmare as we went out to find our dead and missing.</v>

1433
01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:29.080
I think each of us cracked up a little bit that day.

1434
01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.050
As the true picture of the action began to unfold,

1435
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:34.510
then it came across the radio.

1436
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:39.070
Bravo company had found an one other survivor from our second platoon.

1437
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:43.780
He had been badly wounded in the legs and it propped himself up against a tree.

1438
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:48.070
He had been burned by napalm waiting in the night and some north Vietnamese had

1439
01:25:48.071 --> 01:25:50.350
put a pistol to his eye and pulled the trigger,

1440
01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:56.650
shot him in the eye,
blinded him,
but he was still alive.

1441
01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.620
I saw him being brought in by stretcher,
smoking a cigarette,
all fucked up.

1442
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:08.250
So at this point,
things had backed off a little bit.

1443
01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.930
They backed off and they actually did the mad minute,

1444
01:26:12.931 --> 01:26:16.560
which is something that Hackworth talks about and it's something that they did

1445
01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.580
in the first part of this book,
which is,
Hey,

1446
01:26:20.581 --> 01:26:24.990
everyone in the perimeter is just going to shoot a bunch of rounds like at six

1447
01:26:24.991 --> 01:26:25.920
30 in the morning,
boom,

1448
01:26:25.921 --> 01:26:30.921
everyone fire a full load out or a full magazine or a couple magazines at likely

1449
01:26:31.711 --> 01:26:32.544
targets

1450
01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:37.530
and they did that and that seemed to calm things down.

1451
01:26:37.531 --> 01:26:42.531
They kind of did that once things had already calmed down a little bit and

1452
01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.793
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1453
01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.770
<v 3>it was,
it was.
It indicated that maybe things were calming down a letter.</v>

1454
01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:50.150
Here's another thing.
Back to the book,

1455
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:53.600
the Nva came into the ambush area that night to to recover their dead wounded.

1456
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:56.150
When they found any of our guys alive,

1457
01:26:56.330 --> 01:27:00.620
they would beat them to death bayonet them or machete them to avoid shooting and

1458
01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:01.970
drawing fire from us.

1459
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.040
That was during the night.
They did that.
Like I said,

1460
01:27:08.041 --> 01:27:09.300
they did the madmen and here's what,

1461
01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.500
here's what lieutenant risk score Orla said about the mad minute.
He said,

1462
01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:17.820
this decision was regrettable rifle fire shattered the silence and the perimeter

1463
01:27:17.821 --> 01:27:19.770
was ringed with reckless firing.

1464
01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:24.420
Little fought had been given that the remainder of our survivors were sprawled

1465
01:27:24.421 --> 01:27:27.210
among the trees and ant hills within 500 yards.

1466
01:27:27.211 --> 01:27:30.420
The effective range of RM sixteens.
What the fuck is happening?

1467
01:27:30.570 --> 01:27:34.170
Are you shooting at us?
The frantic radio calls started coming in.

1468
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:35.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1469
01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:39.280
<v 3>How many troops were killed or injured by our wake up call?
We'll never be known.</v>

1470
01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:44.440
Thank God for the trees,
the ant hills and the on even terrain.

1471
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:47.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1472
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:49.890
<v 3>Captain at Dudley to de mi,</v>

1473
01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:54.420
Third Brigade Fire Support Coordinator remembers flying out to Albany at first

1474
01:27:54.421 --> 01:27:57.210
light the next morning.
Tim Brown,
myself,

1475
01:27:57.211 --> 01:28:01.920
Mickey parish took a while to get through the smoke hanging over the whole area.

1476
01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:05.580
Not much had really taken place in terms of policing the area.

1477
01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:10.820
The image is still vivid in my mind is the carnage folks.

1478
01:28:11.011 --> 01:28:14.190
We're still sitting around in a daze.
They hadn't done much,

1479
01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.160
hadn't even taken ponchos and covered up these bodies.

1480
01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:18.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1481
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:21.800
<v 3>I could handle the conversation.
I could handle grown men crying,</v>

1482
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:24.320
but we were talking 12 hours later,

1483
01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:25.790
<v 1>okay.</v>

1484
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:30.350
<v 3>Sitting there feeling sorry for themselves.
Colonel Brown was very pissed off.</v>

1485
01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.260
Even if you do get caught in a bad situation,

1486
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:35.150
you have to do something to recover.

1487
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:40.070
It was young kids who paid the price in later years.

1488
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.920
I used to stress that to my young battery commanders.

1489
01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.760
It isn't us who die in combat.
It's those young kids who die.

1490
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.810
Those kids,
we are responsible for training and leading.

1491
01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.160
It's our job to get the job done and get those kids home safe.

1492
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:06.580
Then here,
they're wrapping up this again.

1493
01:29:06.581 --> 01:29:11.581
Now this the battle turned and and really the Vietnamese laughed after these

1494
01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:14.980
massive airstrikes.
It started

1495
01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:17.843
<v 2>and</v>

1496
01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.560
<v 3>here's another image of the cleanup back to the book specialist for John</v>

1497
01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:29.270
Wooliness of Bravo Company,
second battalion,
Seventh Cavalry Mortar Platoon,

1498
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:34.070
and most of the rest of [inaudible] men were involved in this McCobb depressing

1499
01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.950
duty.
It was incredible carnage.

1500
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:42.450
We went into areas where lots of artillery had come in during the night and we

1501
01:29:42.451 --> 01:29:44.970
saw our guys had been blown up in the trees.

1502
01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:50.140
The bodies were already decomposed and it had only happened night before.

1503
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.600
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1504
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.540
<v 3>we were in shock.
It was the first,</v>

1505
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:59.460
last and only time I ever saw anything like it and I pray never again.

1506
01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:01.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1507
01:30:01.650 --> 01:30:03.210
<v 3>The stench was unbelievable.</v>

1508
01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:07.220
We started hauling in the whole body's first.

1509
01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:10.220
Then we brought in the pieces and parts

1510
01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:17.130
two chinooks came in and we loaded one with about 20 corpses neatly arranged in

1511
01:30:17.981 --> 01:30:18.814
litters.

1512
01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:19.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.180
<v 3>The pilot began preparing to take off.</v>

1514
01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.960
One of our officers pointed him 16 at the pilot and told him to keep the board

1515
01:30:25.961 --> 01:30:27.670
on the ground.
We weren't through.

1516
01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:29.720
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1517
01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.670
<v 3>bodies were loaded floor to ceiling.</v>

1518
01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:37.490
When the ramp find the closed blood poured through the hinges,

1519
01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:44.250
I felt sorry for the poor bastards who would have to unload this chopper back at

1520
01:30:44.251 --> 01:30:45.084
Holloway.

1521
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:53.040
The nightmares bored of this battle have never faded him.

1522
01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:06.053
<v 2>The</v>

1523
01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.050
<v 3>final division headquarters account</v>

1524
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:18.520
reported that the two seven Alpha and Bravo companies and the one five battalion

1525
01:31:19.251 --> 01:31:22.700
suffered 151 men killed in action,

1526
01:31:22.701 --> 01:31:26.480
121 wounded and for missing in action.

1527
01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:33.460
And on April 6th,

1528
01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:35.740
1966 so quite some months later,

1529
01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:40.890
how Moore who was at that time had become the third brigade commander,

1530
01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:46.090
went back to Lz Albany and recovered the bodies of all four members of two,

1531
01:31:46.091 --> 01:31:46.960
seven who were

1532
01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.250
brought back on a Hilo and begin the

1533
01:31:53.890 --> 01:31:56.080
long journey home to America.

1534
01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:03.380
Now this was,

1535
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:06.320
as I said,
kind of the,

1536
01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:09.800
the tipping point in the Vietnam War.

1537
01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:14.750
And this battle had a impact strategically.

1538
01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:18.080
One thing that came from this battle,

1539
01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.540
and it'll talk about a little bit more in the book,

1540
01:32:20.541 --> 01:32:25.541
but the body count came back and the body cam came back basically as 10 to one

1541
01:32:26.031 --> 01:32:27.350
or maybe 12 to one.

1542
01:32:27.351 --> 01:32:32.351
So for every 10 or 12 north Vietnamese soldier that was dead,

1543
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.590
there was only one American guild.

1544
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:41.530
And our generals liked that ratio.
They thought,

1545
01:32:41.531 --> 01:32:44.290
hey,
you know,
we can win a war of attrition.

1546
01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:48.173
<v 1>And</v>

1547
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:54.040
<v 3>one of the comments that comes in in the book as they go back in and interview</v>

1548
01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.110
General Gi App,
who's the,

1549
01:32:56.170 --> 01:33:00.410
the senior general of the North Vietnamese army,

1550
01:33:00.411 --> 01:33:02.950
and he's got a book actually that we're going to do on the podcast at some
point,

1551
01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:06.970
he's the mastermind or the strategy,
and he said,

1552
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.560
we thought that the Americans must have a strategy.

1553
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:16.900
We did.
We had the strategy of a people's war.

1554
01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:18.483
No,

1555
01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:23.590
part of what that means is that the strategy of the people's war means we're

1556
01:33:23.591 --> 01:33:25.930
going to,
we're going to suffer some casualties,
and we're okay with that.

1557
01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.830
So our strategy of saying,
well,

1558
01:33:29.831 --> 01:33:32.650
we'll get them into a war of attrition and were okay with it.
They don't care.

1559
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.230
Human life has less human.

1560
01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:38.870
A human life has less value for them at this time.
They,

1561
01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:41.950
they're the commanders sure as hell didn't care.
You know,

1562
01:33:41.951 --> 01:33:43.870
we talked about that last time.
They're losing guys on the,

1563
01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:47.170
from malaria on the trail,
you're going to lose five,
six guys.
They don't care.

1564
01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.630
They've got a war to win.

1565
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:57.870
So talking about some of the other sort of strategic things or strategic

1566
01:33:58.541 --> 01:34:00.730
implications from this.

1567
01:34:05.190 --> 01:34:06.023
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1568
01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.530
<v 3>Night 1967 so this is a couple of years later,
back to the book.
In mid December,</v>

1569
01:34:11.531 --> 01:34:15.070
President Johnson convened a White House meeting of his top advisors.

1570
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.750
Will Bundy says that McNamara is option number one get the hell out of Vietnam.

1571
01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:22.690
Now,
while the getting is good was never seriously considered,

1572
01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:24.430
nor was it pressed by Mcnamara.

1573
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:28.240
Option number two,

1574
01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:32.830
the huge buildup of American combat and support troops was readily approved by

1575
01:34:32.831 --> 01:34:36.040
all including Mcnamara
ever.

1576
01:34:36.041 --> 01:34:41.041
The numbers cruncher Mcnamara told the gathering the military solution to the

1577
01:34:41.261 --> 01:34:46.261
problem is not certain the odds of success are one out of three or one out of

1578
01:34:46.631 --> 01:34:47.464
two

1579
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.770
Mcnamara did push for a bombing pause to prepare us opinion,

1580
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.770
public opinion for the combing escalation.
So

1581
01:34:59.150 --> 01:34:59.930
<v 0>again,
we'll,</v>

1582
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:04.930
I'm sure at some point on this podcast we will dive deep into the political

1583
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:06.710
<v 2>okay</v>

1584
01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:10.850
<v 0>manipulation,
the political decision making that happened during the Vietnam War.</v>

1585
01:35:10.851 --> 01:35:12.830
But this is,
this is what they're talking about.

1586
01:35:12.831 --> 01:35:17.780
It's interesting to hear McNamara even back in 1967 to saying,

1587
01:35:17.781 --> 01:35:21.560
hey,
we got like a one in three,
maybe one and two odds of winning.

1588
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.640
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1589
01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:27.630
<v 0>does this not?
That's not,
that's not good odds.
We don't like those odds.</v>

1590
01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:32.563
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:36.100
<v 0>Here's,
here's how more talking again,</v>

1592
01:35:36.101 --> 01:35:38.500
back to the book in late June,

1593
01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:42.460
1966 my turn was up as commander of the Third Brigade when my replacement or

1594
01:35:42.461 --> 01:35:45.460
colonel straight out of the Pentagon showed up to take over.

1595
01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.100
My Brigade was in the field fighting near Dong tray.

1596
01:35:48.670 --> 01:35:52.590
It would have been criminal in those circumstances to relinquish my command to

1597
01:35:52.591 --> 01:35:54.100
them.
Two man who still,

1598
01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.090
who still pissing state side water and I flatly refuse to do so.

1599
01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:01.750
The change of command was delayed 10 days until the fight was over.

1600
01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:07.570
A month later on August 8th,
1966 my replacement's sent my replacement,

1601
01:36:07.571 --> 01:36:08.560
sent Alpha Company,

1602
01:36:08.561 --> 01:36:13.360
First Battalion Seventh Cavalry back in the I drank valley by itself and 25 men

1603
01:36:13.361 --> 01:36:15.010
were killed in one terrible day.

1604
01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.100
So not a good turnover situation.
And again,
this is where,
this is where the beer,

1605
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.650
people always talk about what I talked with businesses.
They go,

1606
01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:27.380
we have a big bureaucracy here that you don't understand.
Like,
no,

1607
01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.630
we understand the military understands pornography better than anybody.

1608
01:36:29.631 --> 01:36:34.631
We probably got the biggest and most most firm in place,

1609
01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:38.120
bureaucracy in the world.

1610
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:39.263
<v 2>Hmm,</v>

1611
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:42.410
<v 0>and this is part of it right here.
Back to the book.</v>

1612
01:36:42.411 --> 01:36:45.890
I had hope that my next assignment would be to the infantry school at Fort

1613
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:48.560
Benning where I could pass along what I learned in Vietnam for the young

1614
01:36:48.561 --> 01:36:51.530
officers who are headed for combat.
It was not to be,

1615
01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:55.310
in fact only one of the hundreds of officers who had gone through air mobile

1616
01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:59.780
trading and a year in the field with the First Cavalry Division was assigned to

1617
01:36:59.781 --> 01:37:00.830
the infantry school.

1618
01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:05.810
I was sent instead to Washington DC where I was told my neck next job would be

1619
01:37:05.811 --> 01:37:10.340
Latin American desk at the US State Department.
This is,
this is an embarrassment,

1620
01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.051
right?

1621
01:37:12.051 --> 01:37:17.051
Here's this guy basically created or helped create or help test the,

1622
01:37:18.071 --> 01:37:22.460
the idea of air mobile,
helicopter assault.

1623
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:24.500
And then he did it for a year in the field,

1624
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:27.140
commanded at the battalion and that the brigade level,

1625
01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.050
and instead of putting them in the infantry score,

1626
01:37:30.051 --> 01:37:33.860
he could teach the stuff that he learned.
They send them to be the,
the,

1627
01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.690
the Latin American desk.

1628
01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.313
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:41.290
<v 0>And I'll tell you what's awesome.
This was awesome when I was in the seal teams,</v>

1630
01:37:41.291 --> 01:37:44.230
I went to [inaudible] when I came home,
guess where I went?

1631
01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:48.040
I took over the west coast seal training for the guys that were getting ready to

1632
01:37:48.041 --> 01:37:51.850
deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan.
I did what he wanted to do,
which is perfect.

1633
01:37:51.851 --> 01:37:55.180
And then luckily we have the little,
a little less bureaucracy.

1634
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:59.460
I was able to talk to my boss and say,
Hey,
this is what I should be doing.

1635
01:37:59.461 --> 01:38:02.250
He said,
yeah,
you're right.
And put me in that position.

1636
01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:03.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1637
01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:06.130
<v 0>But it didn't happen and here's all this knowledge going.
And they said,</v>

1638
01:38:06.131 --> 01:38:07.780
only one officer out of a hundred.

1639
01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:08.843
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1640
01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:17.280
<v 0>That's another thing,
like when you hear,
you know,
people in the business world,</v>

1641
01:38:17.281 --> 01:38:18.990
they say,
well,
the military is this great organization.

1642
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:23.130
The military has all kinds of problems.
Hmm.
Military is no perfect,

1643
01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:27.460
no perfect example of the way to run things.
Parts of it are,
hmm.

1644
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.590
But you can't look at the military to whole and say that that even remotely make

1645
01:38:31.591 --> 01:38:32.790
sense in any way,
shape or form.

1646
01:38:32.791 --> 01:38:34.710
And I could point a thousand things out to you today.

1647
01:38:34.711 --> 01:38:39.450
The military is the same way,
doing dumb stuff.
I mean,
it's a great organization,

1648
01:38:39.451 --> 01:38:42.300
has got great people.
There's,
there's unbelievable leaders in there,

1649
01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:43.440
but there's also idiots.

1650
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:44.623
<v 1>Mm.</v>

1651
01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.630
<v 0>The military is made up of people of human beings.</v>

1652
01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.750
Brilliant.
Once dumb ones.

1653
01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.110
Back to the book for the next year,

1654
01:39:01.111 --> 01:39:04.140
I watched Bob Mcnamara and John McNaughton,

1655
01:39:04.141 --> 01:39:08.130
both brilliant men go through hell as they struggled unsuccessfully to get a

1656
01:39:08.131 --> 01:39:11.940
handle on the war and the pacification progress in Vietnam.

1657
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:13.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1658
01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:16.590
<v 0>At the end of that year,
neither of them was either.</v>

1659
01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:20.630
Neither of them was any closer to finding or creating such a handle.

1660
01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:22.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1661
01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:27.180
<v 0>An office wit summed up what was happening in Vietnam,
sadly and succinctly.</v>

1662
01:39:28.890 --> 01:39:29.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1663
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:31.110
<v 0>Although we have redoubled our efforts,</v>

1664
01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:37.280
we have lost sight of our objective to a porn.

1665
01:39:37.531 --> 01:39:41.400
All this troops in there,
porn,
oldest money in there,
putting all this,

1666
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:45.360
all these assets in there.
We've,
we've redoubled our efforts,

1667
01:39:45.361 --> 01:39:48.420
but we've lost sight of our objective.

1668
01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:54.140
Back to the book.
What then had we learned with our sacrifices in the,

1669
01:39:54.141 --> 01:39:54.974
I drank valley.

1670
01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1671
01:39:56.150 --> 01:39:59.900
<v 0>We had learned something about fighting the north Vietnamese regulars and</v>

1672
01:39:59.901 --> 01:40:01.640
something important about ourselves.

1673
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:06.320
We could stand against the finest light infantry troops in the world and hold

1674
01:40:06.321 --> 01:40:07.154
our ground.

1675
01:40:07.930 --> 01:40:08.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1676
01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.640
<v 0>General Westmoreland fought.</v>

1677
01:40:10.641 --> 01:40:14.000
He had found the answer to the question of how to win this war.

1678
01:40:14.150 --> 01:40:19.150
He would train one American life for 10 or 11 or 12 north Vietnamese lives day

1679
01:40:21.351 --> 01:40:24.770
after day until [inaudible] cried.
Uncle

1680
01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:29.760
Westmoreland would learn too late.

1681
01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:31.290
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1682
01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:32.160
<v 0>That he was wrong.</v>

1683
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.000
That the American people didn't see a kill ratio of 10 to one or even 20 to one

1684
01:40:39.401 --> 01:40:40.990
as any kind of bargain.

1685
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:43.463
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:48.390
<v 0>But we had validated both the principal and the practice of air mobile warfare.</v>

1687
01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:54.340
1 million American soldiers would ride to battle Huey helicopters

1688
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:59.340
<v 3>for the next eight years and the familiar wa Wah will have their rotors would be</v>

1689
01:40:59.531 --> 01:41:02.020
the enduring soundtrack of this war.

1690
01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:08.120
Finally,
even though it took 10 years,

1691
01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:13.360
cost the lives of 58,000 young Americans and flicked it humiliating defeat on a

1692
01:41:14.091 --> 01:41:16.430
nation that had never before lost a war.

1693
01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:21.640
Some of US learned that Clausewitz had it right on hundred and 50 years earlier

1694
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:24.350
when he wrote these words,

1695
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:26.733
<v 1>okay,</v>

1696
01:41:27.090 --> 01:41:31.020
<v 3>no one starts a war or rather,</v>

1697
01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:36.140
no one in his senses ought to do so without first being clear in his mind what

1698
01:41:38.101 --> 01:41:43.101
he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

1699
01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:50.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1700
01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:55.243
<v 3>Clausewitz</v>

1701
01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.380
to be clear in your mind,

1702
01:42:01.890 --> 01:42:05.340
in what you intend to achieve.

1703
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:10.863
No.

1704
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:15.220
What you are going to do that doesn't seem like too much to ask.

1705
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:19.350
Certainly in war

1706
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:30.350
and you wouldn't think it would be too much for people to ask in their lives

1707
01:42:31.110 --> 01:42:31.943
either.

1708
01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:38.420
They're precious lives as precious as these 58,000

1709
01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:40.640
<v 1>okay.</v>

1710
01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.220
<v 3>That died in Vietnam
heroes,</v>

1711
01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:53.460
but how often do we see people going through their lives without knowing what

1712
01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.520
they are trying to do without having any intent,

1713
01:42:56.521 --> 01:42:59.280
without having a clear mission.

1714
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:05.050
I'm talking to on an individual level as a person,

1715
01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:11.980
people go through their lives without knowing what it is they want to do,

1716
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:15.140
what they want to accomplish.

1717
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:25.810
So know what your mission is,

1718
01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:32.790
know what your intent as the commander of your life,

1719
01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:37.820
know what your intent is and then fight with everything you've got

1720
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:43.663
to win.

1721
01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:51.170
<v 1>Yeah,
and I think that's</v>

1722
01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:55.130
<v 0>all I've got for tonight.
So</v>

1723
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:58.850
that go maybe if you want to

1724
01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.600
shed some light on how people can

1725
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:09.250
maybe help themselves a win that war and maybe support the podcast if they want

1726
01:44:11.451 --> 01:44:15.770
to.
They want to
that point though,

1727
01:44:16.610 --> 01:44:21.530
in my opinion is a good,
it's a good one.
It's a good way to think about you.

1728
01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.810
People go through the lines,
I don't even know what they're trying to do.
Yeah.

1729
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:27.770
And it sounds the same thing as going to war without knowing what the outcome is

1730
01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:30.620
supposed to be.
Yeah.
Goal.

1731
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:36.280
But it sounds kind of like a bs when you say it,

1732
01:44:36.761 --> 01:44:40.570
you know,
like,
Hey,
go through.
Like,
you know,
when you go through life,

1733
01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:44.620
should you have a goal,
a real obvious yes.
You're going to say,
no,

1734
01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:47.710
you shouldn't have a goal kind of thing.
So it seems obvious,

1735
01:44:47.711 --> 01:44:50.860
but you know how you live day to day.
You,
you know,

1736
01:44:50.861 --> 01:44:53.050
you might have a goal for the day,
maybe two,
maybe three,

1737
01:44:53.051 --> 01:44:58.051
but Brett life is for life is a full spectrum of stuff we're or get.

1738
01:44:58.801 --> 01:45:01.030
It's so shocking because what you're saying is absolutely true.

1739
01:45:01.090 --> 01:45:04.660
You wouldn't think that people would be going through life without knowing where

1740
01:45:04.661 --> 01:45:05.890
they're trying to get to yet.

1741
01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:11.400
But you wouldn't think that a nation would go to war without clear intention of

1742
01:45:11.531 --> 01:45:13.900
where they want to end up and how they're going to get there.

1743
01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.340
At least an idea of how are you gonna get there.

1744
01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:20.280
Now I have a little bit of like when Klaus Fitz says how you're going to conduct

1745
01:45:20.281 --> 01:45:22.840
a war,
that's not necessarily true because you don't know.

1746
01:45:22.841 --> 01:45:26.010
You can't know how you're going to conduct a war before the war starts and you

1747
01:45:26.011 --> 01:45:29.470
can have an idea,
but you can't know fully.
Just like if you were to say,
Hey,

1748
01:45:29.471 --> 01:45:33.760
my goal is to x in my life and you don't know how you're going to be able to do

1749
01:45:33.761 --> 01:45:35.620
that because he's talking about,

1750
01:45:35.621 --> 01:45:37.860
because you've got to adjust because you're going to make an adaptation as

1751
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:40.630
things are going to come up,
things are gonna change.
The battlefield changes,

1752
01:45:40.631 --> 01:45:42.850
your life changes,
things pop up.
I mean,
things happen.

1753
01:45:42.851 --> 01:45:47.470
So I think that that idea that you're going to know how you're going to execute

1754
01:45:47.471 --> 01:45:50.650
something is,
is farfetched.

1755
01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:53.140
I think actually I should use the word idea.

1756
01:45:53.170 --> 01:45:54.940
You should have an idea of how you're going to do it.
Yeah.

1757
01:45:55.210 --> 01:45:57.700
You just have an idea like,
okay,
well this is what I need to get done.

1758
01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:02.410
This is what I want to achieve in my life.
Yeah.
I want to make,
I want to do this.

1759
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:08.220
What's a simple one?
I want to own a house.
That's a simple one.

1760
01:46:08.221 --> 01:46:11.490
That's a good place to start.
I want to own a house.
Okay.
Well,

1761
01:46:11.970 --> 01:46:14.760
let's think about how we're going to get there.
You know,
that's,
that's,

1762
01:46:14.761 --> 01:46:17.340
let's think about how we're going to get there.
You have to build your credit.

1763
01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:19.890
You have to,
how do you build your credit?
You have to,
you have to borrow money.

1764
01:46:19.891 --> 01:46:21.390
Some people,
some people,
they go to buy a house.

1765
01:46:21.391 --> 01:46:22.410
They've never borrowed money before.

1766
01:46:22.411 --> 01:46:24.150
You can't borrow money if you've never borrowed money.

1767
01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:26.580
You can borrow money for a house if you've never borrowed money for a car or a

1768
01:46:26.850 --> 01:46:30.870
or a or some smaller object before,
so you've got to establish your credit.

1769
01:46:30.871 --> 01:46:32.490
Then you've got to have two years worth of income.

1770
01:46:32.491 --> 01:46:34.530
Then you've got to have a big fat down payments and rent,

1771
01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:36.570
so there's things you got to do this thing now.

1772
01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:38.370
Now that might change along the way.

1773
01:46:38.371 --> 01:46:40.470
The idea is that you've got to move towards that goal,

1774
01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:44.430
but that's what was so nice about hearing the Vietnamese commander's intent.

1775
01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:49.680
Get close,
split them up.
Boom.
You go make that happen.
Hey,
guess what?

1776
01:46:49.681 --> 01:46:54.060
You want to buy a house one day?
Save money.
Have good credit.
Yeah.
Okay,

1777
01:46:54.061 --> 01:46:55.380
well you got to make money.
How you can make money.

1778
01:46:55.381 --> 01:46:59.340
You might make it drive an Uber.
You might make it delivering pizza.

1779
01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:02.130
You might make,
cause you got your real job,
but that support in your family,

1780
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:03.780
but then you need a little extra to throw in there.

1781
01:47:03.781 --> 01:47:06.000
Well that's why you end up driving Uber or you end up with whatever it is you're

1782
01:47:06.001 --> 01:47:06.361
going to do.

1783
01:47:06.361 --> 01:47:08.730
Are you ready to be to make your some money on the side that you can start

1784
01:47:08.731 --> 01:47:11.000
stashing away?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1785
01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:17.380
<v 4>At the end of the day,
you do have that goal,
you know,
so it is,</v>

1786
01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.920
yeah.
How you conduct yourself.
It's not gonna be cut and dry for sure.

1787
01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.790
But you know,
in these examples like uh,
you know,
you want to buy a house,

1788
01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.260
that's a goal.
That's a specific goal.

1789
01:47:26.261 --> 01:47:28.730
But that's just one teeny tiny goal in life.
If you're,

1790
01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:32.890
of course you're not going to run into somebody who their only goal in life is

1791
01:47:32.891 --> 01:47:33.410
to buy a house.

1792
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:36.350
<v 0>No,
no,
no.
I said a civil war.
Yeah.
It cause some people like,</v>

1793
01:47:36.351 --> 01:47:39.170
hey don't buy a house.
It's stupid.
You should rent and stuff.
That's fine.

1794
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:41.300
I'm not telling everyone what their goal should be.

1795
01:47:41.301 --> 01:47:44.390
And if you want to keep renting,
keep renting.
Maybe that's for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1796
01:47:44.391 --> 01:47:47.630
Fully.
Not for me yet.
Maybe it's for you.

1797
01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:49.400
There's other things you want to put your money.
That's cool.

1798
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:53.560
You're doing some other something else smart with your money.
That's fine.
Yeah.

1799
01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:56.450
Like buying rims or something like that.
Either way

1800
01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:58.500
<v 4>though.
If you,
uh,</v>

1801
01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:03.600
consider like just what lint closet of how do you see anything?
What,

1802
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:07.560
what he's saying and compare it to life,
right?
Where buying house.
Sure.

1803
01:48:07.561 --> 01:48:10.950
That's one of many goals you can have in life because life is full.
Like miss it,

1804
01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:14.970
but so it Kinda,
when you really think about it,
right,
it's hard.

1805
01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:19.790
It's hard to like designate some specific goals and then that's all you're going

1806
01:48:19.791 --> 01:48:19.910
to,

1807
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:20.880
<v 0>okay.
Let's say you're gonna,</v>

1808
01:48:21.010 --> 01:48:25.130
you're going to say you're going to be financially secure and independent.
Okay.

1809
01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:27.970
That would be a much bigger boss.
Right?
Well,
yeah,
that's an awesome goal.
Bath.

1810
01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.770
And the younger you make that goal,
the better chance you have of achieving it.

1811
01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:32.300
Yeah.
Cause now you're not wasting your money.

1812
01:48:32.301 --> 01:48:34.220
You're actually saving for a house so you can get that house paid off.

1813
01:48:34.221 --> 01:48:36.130
So now you don't have a mortgage anywhere.
You know?
He's like,
yeah,
yeah.

1814
01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:38.330
That's a bigger goal.
That's a broader goal.
Just like when you,

1815
01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:41.840
when you go to war,
you need to know what it is you're going to war for.

1816
01:48:41.841 --> 01:48:44.780
What are you going to do and when are you going to stop and what's your intended

1817
01:48:44.781 --> 01:48:45.400
result?

1818
01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.950
<v 4>Yeah.
So you get to,
in a way,</v>

1819
01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:52.480
you got to fill your life with a bunch of goals,

1820
01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:57.270
<v 0>Jim.
Cause like if you have small goals that lead to the big goal,
right?</v>

1821
01:48:57.330 --> 01:49:01.320
So for instance,
you want to be financially secure and stable.

1822
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:03.960
What are you going to do?
You're going to save some of your money.
Okay,

1823
01:49:03.961 --> 01:49:06.480
that's one thing.
And you're going to buy a house.
That's another thing.

1824
01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:08.880
You're going to pay off your car and you're not going to buy expensive.

1825
01:49:08.970 --> 01:49:13.290
Dumb cars are going to buy cheap cars until you have the money to buy them with

1826
01:49:13.291 --> 01:49:14.820
cash.
You know,
you're going to make all these little things.

1827
01:49:14.821 --> 01:49:16.320
You're going to work extra,
you're going to,
you know,

1828
01:49:16.321 --> 01:49:18.480
you're going to do these things.
So you're right,
you have,

1829
01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:21.900
you have your broad goal.
Yes.
You have your longterm goal.
Yes.

1830
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:24.630
And then you've got your short term goals that lead and are strategically

1831
01:49:24.631 --> 01:49:27.090
aligned with that longterm goal.
It's the same thing in war.

1832
01:49:27.091 --> 01:49:30.690
You have to have those,
both those things going on.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1833
01:49:30.691 --> 01:49:35.140
And then on top of that,
you should have one,
I have the last word today.

1834
01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:37.740
Don't you know,
I'm making this

1835
01:49:39.670 --> 01:49:43.200
every time I concisely close out what you're trying to say.
You add,

1836
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:48.190
<v 4>cause it's not that,
I mean it is that,
but then you're talking about life now,</v>

1837
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.670
then here,
ears kind of the point where you say,
okay,

1838
01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:54.910
you say one example is financial.
Um,

1839
01:49:55.450 --> 01:49:59.020
like you want to buy a house,
you want to be financially secure.
That's one goal.

1840
01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:02.410
But in life there's more to life than just financial.
So you want your health,

1841
01:50:02.411 --> 01:50:04.990
you might your,
you know,
relationships you want,
you're like,

1842
01:50:04.991 --> 01:50:09.991
there's all these things that you kind of hope or want to be solid.

1843
01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:13.780
We'll say so.

1844
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:18.790
But most people don't really put it in perspective that clearly,
okay,
I,
yes,

1845
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:23.470
you know,
I'm gonna write this down.
I want this goals.
If you have goals,
yes.

1846
01:50:23.471 --> 01:50:27.490
If you have goals in those areas,
then you can,
you know,

1847
01:50:27.491 --> 01:50:31.330
you can avoid a maneuver towards I'm exactly right.
And avoid distractions,

1848
01:50:31.331 --> 01:50:35.200
all this stuff.
Right.
And fight and fight towards those goals.
It sounds obvious,

1849
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:37.570
but that's what I'm saying.

1850
01:50:37.571 --> 01:50:40.360
It's like hard to like designate each goal

1851
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:45.910
in life.
Oh,
I didn't say this was going to be easy.
Yeah,
that's the,

1852
01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:47.900
it's not that hard.
If you sat down for 20 minutes,

1853
01:50:47.901 --> 01:50:49.550
I bet you could come up with some solid life goals.

1854
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:53.750
That's kind of the point I was making where it's you're busy cruising and to

1855
01:50:53.751 --> 01:50:58.580
come up with life goals.
Really it's about this being distracted.

1856
01:50:58.581 --> 01:51:02.120
I think that's what it is.
You know?
And if the clearer your goal,

1857
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:05.780
the more I think control you can have over being distracted or not.

1858
01:51:05.781 --> 01:51:07.790
Cause like if your goal isn't that clear,

1859
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:11.000
it's almost like it's not going to be clear or it is,

1860
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:14.310
you won't really be clear when you're being distracted or not kind of thing.

1861
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:18.550
People don't,
and I'm saying people,
I mean myself,

1862
01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:24.420
we don't live our lives like just in constant pursuit of all our specific goals.

1863
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:30.670
It's like a lot of life is minute to minute man.
No,
no,
no.

1864
01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:33.070
It is grab telling you a lot of life.

1865
01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.160
You can have some sections that you can carve out so you can live like that.

1866
01:51:36.161 --> 01:51:38.860
But that's not where you are.
I'm not saying this should be how you're rolling.

1867
01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:41.330
Yeah,
no,
no.
That's not how it should be.
That's what I'm saying.
So,

1868
01:51:41.590 --> 01:51:45.910
and you'll notice in life,
I think like any,
any solid goal that you've achieved,

1869
01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:46.990
you'll notice that,

1870
01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:50.960
that it took that clear goal and you just didn't get distracted and you just

1871
01:51:50.961 --> 01:51:53.380
fought for it.
So it's like you've done it for yourself.

1872
01:51:53.381 --> 01:51:56.050
And there's also just like being on the path.
Yeah,

1873
01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:57.760
that's what I'm thinking about Jujitsu.
Right.

1874
01:51:58.910 --> 01:52:03.050
My goal in Jujitsu was never to get a black belt.
I never said like,

1875
01:52:03.110 --> 01:52:06.590
I want to be a black belt in Jiu Jitsu.
It never,
I never even thought that.
Yeah.

1876
01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:10.760
I just wanted to get better at this thing.
Right.
Oh,
okay,
so you're not take,

1877
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:13.380
Eddie has never you.
It was never,

1878
01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:15.980
my main goal was not to get a black button it,

1879
01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:21.040
my goal was to train Jiu Jitsu and get better at Jujitsu and therefore comes,

1880
01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:27.020
my goal was like even finances.
I wasn't like,
Hey,

1881
01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.270
I want to make x amount of money.
I was like,

1882
01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:33.020
I want to be able to do whatever I want to do,
so let's move in that direction.

1883
01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:36.800
Yeah.
That might not even have a financial value.

1884
01:52:36.801 --> 01:52:38.360
Like there's some people that do whatever they want to do,

1885
01:52:38.361 --> 01:52:40.130
but they have a very low income,

1886
01:52:40.131 --> 01:52:43.670
but they set themselves up in such a way that they're allowed to do what they

1887
01:52:43.671 --> 01:52:47.660
pretty much want to do.
Check.
All right.
Are you done?
Last word,

1888
01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:52.130
last word anyway?
Oh yeah.
Support.
Right.
That's what we were new.

1889
01:52:52.131 --> 01:52:54.220
We were talking about.
All right.
Yeah.
You can surprise them.

1890
01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:58.910
I wanted to hear you talk about when you pursue goals you may or may not need

1891
01:52:58.911 --> 01:53:02.420
support.
I recommend support supporting yourself,

1892
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:07.000
supportive others from others for others.
Two Way Street.
Okay.

1893
01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:08.893
Anyway,

1894
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:14.020
if one of your goals is to maintain physical shape and capability is important.

1895
01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:20.370
I work out,
right?
You work out.
Yup.
Right.
Yeah.

1896
01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:22.460
Good.
So I work out right.

1897
01:53:22.461 --> 01:53:27.461
And you know how so my wife will give me grief sometimes cause I'll just like

1898
01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:32.170
work out at the wrong time,
you know,
cause in my mind like working out,

1899
01:53:32.171 --> 01:53:36.680
it's important,
right?
So I can like look,
yes,
I can loosely justify,

1900
01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:41.630
oh yeah,
you know,
yeah it's dinnertime but hey my health.
Right.

1901
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:44.360
And sometimes little she'll frame it like,
oh yeah,

1902
01:53:44.361 --> 01:53:48.500
you choose to like work on your uh,
work on your body or something like that.

1903
01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:52.820
And I say,
no,
it's health.
It's capability.
It's true.

1904
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:55.850
But the point there is,

1905
01:53:57.470 --> 01:54:01.670
it's important no matter how you frame it or your way frames that it's
important.

1906
01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:05.750
Yeah.
You wouldn't do it strategic anyway.
While doing that,

1907
01:54:06.710 --> 01:54:07.700
you take krill oil,

1908
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:13.750
take stuff that helps maintain the structural integrity of your body and the

1909
01:54:14.991 --> 01:54:18.080
good news is Jocko and supplements for that Krill oil,
Jocko,

1910
01:54:18.081 --> 01:54:23.000
super krill and joint warfare.
I've been taking these consistently and solid.

1911
01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:27.680
Legit.
Thank you.
Jocko.
Also,
jockey has a new one called discipline.

1912
01:54:27.681 --> 01:54:32.120
It's a pre admission if your,
if your mission is a workout,

1913
01:54:32.121 --> 01:54:33.040
it's a pre workout.

1914
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:38.180
If your mission is a studying to pre study,
studying,

1915
01:54:38.690 --> 01:54:42.200
pre studying supplement,
you know,
pre mission little uh,

1916
01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:47.190
cognitive enhancers in there.
A little bit of caffeine,
micro dose,
right?
Like,

1917
01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:50.690
yeah.
Yeah.
You don't want to get all strung out on caffeine.

1918
01:54:50.690 --> 01:54:55.690
It's just the perfect amount of essentially also if you are owing,

1919
01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:59.780
let me tell you where to get these things.
Yeah,

1920
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:02.210
because they're not just floating out there.
Anyway,

1921
01:55:02.211 --> 01:55:04.160
I go to origin main.com that's where you get them.

1922
01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:08.000
Also an origin main.com you can get cool gies.
A lot of people still know,

1923
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:11.360
still asking me.
Maybe not every day,

1924
01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:16.040
maybe not other every other day,
but they still ask me what,
Gee,
should I get?

1925
01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:16.381
I started,

1926
01:55:16.381 --> 01:55:21.130
did you get to what you should I get here's ones origin geese,

1927
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.200
100% not even 99% a hundred percent or dinkies a big range to choose from.

1928
01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:32.750
Um,
they also got rash guards in there.
Compression gear for any other activity.

1929
01:55:32.751 --> 01:55:34.730
You like some fashion stuff on there too.

1930
01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:41.100
Going into fashion style.
Come on,
breathe a little bit.
Little bit at all.

1931
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:43.220
Little bit also.

1932
01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:48.030
Oh you mean the plain black victory and may tee shirt and we have,

1933
01:55:48.130 --> 01:55:50.610
oh okay.
Cause that's my level of passion.

1934
01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:55.350
Well it happened to be on Jocko store.com but I'll get to that first things

1935
01:55:55.351 --> 01:55:58.230
first.
Just check if you're doing,

1936
01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:01.080
did you say that origin stuff is made here in America?
No big deal.

1937
01:56:01.710 --> 01:56:03.800
It's no big deal.
This made in America.
Yeah.

1938
01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:07.670
I think it's a big deal but I don't like,
oh you're not going to focus on it

1939
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:16.790
because you know the quality kind of leads with this one or they could go hand

1940
01:56:16.981 --> 01:56:21.210
in hand is is it good quality because it's made in America?
Yes.

1941
01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:26.400
Is it made in America because it's good quality?
No.
Well,

1942
01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:27.293
both

1943
01:56:28.730 --> 01:56:33.440
good quality because it's made in America by qualified craftsman.
Yes.

1944
01:56:33.441 --> 01:56:37.080
I think that's really the case check.
And some of it is,
one of my buddies just,

1945
01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:38.760
uh,
he's,
he was on deployment,

1946
01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:43.820
had an origin g shipped over on deployment and he came home from deployment and

1947
01:56:45.091 --> 01:56:49.350
he'd been training while he was on deployment and he's like,
Bro,

1948
01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:53.160
that origin g is the best thing ever.
And I was like,
yeah,
no.
Yeah,
it is.
Yeah,

1949
01:56:53.161 --> 01:56:57.570
for sure.
So anyways,
and it's made in America.
So yeah,
from the cotton,

1950
01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:03.070
the cotton that's grown here in America,
what do you call,
uh,

1951
01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:08.940
processed here in America?
Woven in America.

1952
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:13.320
Made into,
again,
America.
You can wear it wherever you want,
but it's all,

1953
01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:17.850
you can't wear you wherever you are actually more or less with no,

1954
01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:20.760
there's certain things you're not allowed to do with your gig.
Yeah,
I agree.

1955
01:57:20.761 --> 01:57:25.310
I agree.
Club,
no.
Geek
grocery store.
No Gay.

1956
01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:29.770
Yeah.
Have you ever want to get her grocery store?
No.
Me Neither.

1957
01:57:30.630 --> 01:57:35.100
I've never worn my geeky outside of a Jujitsu Academy.

1958
01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:38.490
I'm confirming what the boy's brain right now.
What about the kind?

1959
01:57:38.491 --> 01:57:42.690
You're either going to Jujitsu or leading you to change their,
yeah,

1960
01:57:42.691 --> 01:57:45.270
you change it.
What if I just started rolling in the gay all the time?

1961
01:57:46.230 --> 01:57:51.100
Like every wearing outside.
That's awkward.
You know what little kids do it?
Yeah,

1962
01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:55.170
that's what it throws the Keon.
She's no problem with that.

1963
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.950
Walking around the supermarket.
No,
she's warm.
She's ready.

1964
01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:02.080
Representing so geek choke.
Somebody cause he keel.

1965
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:07.920
Wearing a geek in the store can be tactically sound.
You know,

1966
01:58:08.010 --> 01:58:09.810
achieving her goals.
Number one,

1967
01:58:10.570 --> 01:58:13.770
you gotta demonstrate every once in a while not being distracted.
It's good.

1968
01:58:14.490 --> 01:58:17.880
Nonetheless.
You're going to get a GE again.
I'll say it now.
I'll say it again.

1969
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:22.050
All made in America.
In America or domain.com boom.
Select whatever you want.

1970
01:58:22.051 --> 01:58:25.950
Get to.
I have two to three actually.
Wait,
no,

1971
01:58:26.010 --> 01:58:30.540
then you discipline equals freedom gig.
Got Dalen so three all together.

1972
01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:35.250
Boom.
Origin.
You want me to get a black one too?
By the way,
that's you know,

1973
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:39.420
also working out.
You're doing Jujitsu.

1974
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:43.750
Maybe you're doing weightlifting,
maybe you're running,
whatever.

1975
01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:46.450
I say do kettle bells and when you do kettle bells,

1976
01:58:46.451 --> 01:58:48.380
get the colon from on it on it,

1977
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:51.160
on [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko look for the primal bells.

1978
01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:55.060
My opinion actually the Zombie ones are pretty dope too,
but get those.

1979
01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:58.930
That's what I think makes it work out more interesting.
I did one yesterday.

1980
01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:03.970
It was interesting.
Kind of hard to um,
but nonetheless,
yeah,

1981
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:05.170
get,
get them from there.

1982
01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:08.830
They got a lot of cool stuff on there for interesting workouts.

1983
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:11.200
Do you want to switch it up?
If you want to do the same,

1984
01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:13.510
like if your workout is boring or something like that,

1985
01:59:13.511 --> 01:59:17.440
you'd like to get some battle ropes.
Go through one of those workouts.

1986
01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:22.470
You did one like that before or a battle ropes workout before.
Yeah.

1987
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:26.450
Interesting.
It kind of makes your like Seretse kind of sore.

1988
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:31.840
You know what that is?
Your intercostal muscles.
Yeah.
Kinda down there.

1989
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:35.800
None the less anyway on it.com/shop or the three,
get them solid site.

1990
01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:39.970
Also when you are getting this book,

1991
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:45.310
we were soldiers once and young.
Actually I thought it was,

1992
01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:48.100
we were soldiers once and young and I was like,
wait,
no,
it's,

1993
01:59:48.101 --> 01:59:53.101
we were soldiers once and young and young and by the way we were young kind of

1994
01:59:53.531 --> 01:59:56.890
thing.
Anyway,
there you get that book.
Good Book.
Outstanding Book.

1995
01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:01.290
<v 0>When you see like my wife will,</v>

1996
02:00:01.340 --> 02:00:04.990
we'll do something that there'll be like young seals at.
Yeah.

1997
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:09.740
And my wife's always like,
oh,
they look so young.
They look so young.
You know?

1998
02:00:09.741 --> 02:00:12.850
And that's what you always think.
You just think that these kids are so young.

1999
02:00:12.851 --> 02:00:16.720
And then I was one of those kids and yeah,
they are young.

2000
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:19.180
That's who fights wars.
Young kids.

2001
02:00:20.110 --> 02:00:24.530
1819 2022 years old.
23 years old.
That's who fights wars.
Yeah.

2002
02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:26.470
Yeah.
And it's crazy.

2003
02:00:26.471 --> 02:00:31.000
And Jp kind of talks about this where your maturity kind of gets on this like

2004
02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:36.070
fast track when you jumped in the military.
It doesn't,
it doesn't.
It doesn't.

2005
02:00:36.071 --> 02:00:39.270
It doesn't.
Because you're also institutionalized.
Oh yeah.
That's true.

2006
02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:41.590
You don't like when you're in the middle.

2007
02:00:41.591 --> 02:00:43.690
That's what hurts some guys when they get out of the military,
they're like,

2008
02:00:43.691 --> 02:00:45.660
wait a second,
I don't wait.
Where's my paycheck is?

2009
02:00:45.670 --> 02:00:48.310
What's to come every two weeks now it's not there anymore.
They used to it.

2010
02:00:48.850 --> 02:00:51.360
Oh you have a mission.
Here's what you're gonna do in that.

2011
02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:53.500
When you're in the military,
you just,

2012
02:00:53.710 --> 02:00:56.140
here's your clothes that you're going to wear.
You know what I mean?

2013
02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:56.680
It makes sense.

2014
02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:58.840
Here's the haircut that you're going to have when you get out of the military.

2015
02:00:58.841 --> 02:01:02.650
Also in,
you're like,
you don't have this direction anymore.
So you do get,

2016
02:01:03.130 --> 02:01:06.190
it matures you in some ways,
but in other ways you get stunted growth.

2017
02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:09.400
That's why he gets him guys doing dumb shit when they're 30 years old,

2018
02:01:09.401 --> 02:01:13.390
38 years old,
42 years old.
They're doing the midlife crisis thing.

2019
02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:17.610
<v 4>But when you think when you,
maybe it's not even a mid level,</v>

2020
02:01:17.611 --> 02:01:19.960
they're just trying to figure it out cause they just haven't had,
right.

2021
02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.390
They didn't do that like at the time as everyone else.

2022
02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:26.030
But you know how you talk about your wife looks at it.

2023
02:01:26.170 --> 02:01:31.170
The younger guys or the seals didn't say oh they look so young that I think

2024
02:01:31.961 --> 02:01:36.010
that's like an indicator that she doesn't feel old.
You know,

2025
02:01:36.190 --> 02:01:37.210
cause you know how like when you're,

2026
02:01:37.450 --> 02:01:40.430
when you kind of look like I do the same thing when I look at college football,

2027
02:01:40.431 --> 02:01:42.200
when I watch college football,
cause I remember when I was,

2028
02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.760
when I was playing football wise,

2029
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:47.420
oh yeah there is a day 26 years old on meeting 26

2030
02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.030
school.
Yeah.
It didn't help.
It was kind of going bald and stuff like that.

2031
02:01:53.031 --> 02:01:55.760
But nonetheless he's 26 26 is young by the way.

2032
02:01:56.930 --> 02:02:01.670
And depending on how old you are because when you're 16 you don't think,

2033
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.890
if I tried to ask my son who's 15 like what,
what,

2034
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:09.610
how far away?
25 years or how,

2035
02:02:09.611 --> 02:02:14.540
how long was it until he was 25 like he oh would understand 10 years he has no,

2036
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.960
he would not be able to like cognitively assess what a 25 year old human being

2037
02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.330
is.
Thinking about these 15 all access.
Not got it going on.
Yeah.

2038
02:02:27.331 --> 02:02:31.760
But I feel like you'd still be able to figure out,
okay,
25 you know,
people,

2039
02:02:31.761 --> 02:02:35.450
when do people die of old age,
quote unquote would be what,
eighties

2040
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:38.900
discipline,
you know,
whenever,

2041
02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:42.560
so you figured 25 it's what?

2042
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:44.810
Less than a 30 year life,

2043
02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:49.110
26 less than a third that would it be considered old technically if they were to

2044
02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.450
think about,
I think 1515 year old would grasp that even the 26 year old was old.

2045
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:56.440
He was,
yeah,
I thought so.
So when I look back and then me,

2046
02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:01.040
I don't feel old as old as I am,
I don't feel like,
oh old.

2047
02:03:01.041 --> 02:03:04.080
I think back when I was in college or whatever,
and I think about the,

2048
02:03:04.090 --> 02:03:06.580
the number of my current age and I think,
Dang,
that's,

2049
02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:11.620
that's all that's an older person being that older person now I don't feel like

2050
02:03:12.831 --> 02:03:15.950
how I thought that older person would have felt right.

2051
02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:19.940
And I really think that now it really comes in,
gets put into perspective.

2052
02:03:19.941 --> 02:03:22.760
When I watch college football and I seem to take off their helmet and like Dang,

2053
02:03:22.761 --> 02:03:26.450
that is a child right there playing college football,
performing,

2054
02:03:26.451 --> 02:03:29.480
outperforming like super good.
But they just look so young.

2055
02:03:29.481 --> 02:03:31.190
I'm just like your wife,
they look so young.

2056
02:03:32.150 --> 02:03:36.790
But it's because I don't feel like an old person.
That's what,
that's good.
Yeah,

2057
02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:39.740
I guess so.
Because you know if you feel like whole person you're like,
yeah,

2058
02:03:39.741 --> 02:03:43.340
they'd look down because they're young.
They're,
I'm an old person there.
You know,

2059
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:46.220
you feel like you,
she could be in there too and they're like,
oh yeah.

2060
02:03:46.221 --> 02:03:49.250
And then you see,
okay he's,
he's young and I'm old.
You know,

2061
02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:51.770
just one of those things on the last back to support

2062
02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:59.210
when you buy this book,
we were soldiers once and young.

2063
02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:00.771
Go to Jocko,

2064
02:04:00.771 --> 02:04:05.180
podcast.com we've got a section that all the books that this book listed by

2065
02:04:05.181 --> 02:04:09.710
episode,
all the books listen by episode plus a few other ones.
Boom.

2066
02:04:09.711 --> 02:04:13.580
Click through there.
We got you taste,
you direct link,
Amazon prime.

2067
02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:19.180
You have prime,
right?
I do one day shipping,
same day she ran sometimes.

2068
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:20.780
Anyway,
get it there.

2069
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:23.480
Good way to support and if you're going to do other shopping,
carry on.

2070
02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:28.190
Good way to support.
Also Jack was the store

2071
02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:40.170
and I'm going to talk about it,
but before I do that,

2072
02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:45.200
I think if you subscribed to the podcast as good way to support what I was going

2073
02:04:45.341 --> 02:04:48.780
to say,
subscribe if you haven't already,
seems obvious,
but subscribe,

2074
02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:52.290
leave a review on iTunes.
If you subscribe to Itunes,

2075
02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:56.730

just get over it.

Leave the review.

2078
02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:07.880
various types of excerpts.
Um,
you know,
so you can share so you don't,

2079
02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:12.660
if you don't want to share the whole two and a half hour podcast with people,

2080
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:17.580
there are excerpts.
If you wanted to share an individual,
a concept with people,

2081
02:05:17.581 --> 02:05:20.040
they can boom,
they can get that concept and you know,
share it,

2082
02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:26.580
internalize it.
You know what I mean?
Also Jack was the store.

2083
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:31.110
It's called chocolate store.
drugstore.com shirts,
tee shirts,

2084
02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:33.510
rash guards,
hoodies,

2085
02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:38.220
some patches on their hats on.
They're just,

2086
02:05:38.250 --> 02:05:41.190
it's the stuff I'll say,
it's cool stuff.

2087
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:44.280
I wouldn't be pushing stuff that I didn't think it was cool

2088
02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:49.080
and it's chocolate proved kind of the pink shirts aren't Jaquobe know.

2089
02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:50.790
But nonetheless nonetheless,

2090
02:05:50.791 --> 02:05:52.680
if you want to get shirts and stuff that that's where it is.

2091
02:05:52.681 --> 02:05:56.460
Jacqueline's store.com uh,
they are good stuff.
They are good.

2092
02:05:58.230 --> 02:06:02.760
They're not like the cheap ones is what I'm saying.
So boom,
you can rest assured.

2093
02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.740
But yeah,
tell me what you think.
If you have one.
Hey,

2094
02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:10.050
people take pictures of themselves with the shirt on and they say this is a good

2095
02:06:10.051 --> 02:06:14.460
shirt and that's good.
I encourage that.
And if you don't like the shirt,

2096
02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:16.703
let me know too.

2097
02:06:19.410 --> 02:06:22.080
There it is also good way to support yourself.

2098
02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.500
One of the better ways in my opinion,
depends on what kind of person you are,

2099
02:06:26.670 --> 02:06:28.800
is psychological warfare.
If you don't know what that is,

2100
02:06:28.801 --> 02:06:33.801
it's an album with tracks with Jocko on each track telling you that in your,

2101
02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:38.580
on your campaign against weakness.
When you read,

2102
02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:42.420
when you hit those roadblocks,
that's what it is.
Rope.
That's what they are.

2103
02:06:42.421 --> 02:06:46.380
Roadblocks,
mental fatigue,
uh,
distractions,

2104
02:06:46.381 --> 02:06:49.530
all this stuff.
These tracks will help you through it.

2105
02:06:49.531 --> 02:06:54.531
It's chocolate telling you pragmatically giving you practical information and

2106
02:06:54.991 --> 02:06:55.824
advice.

2107
02:06:55.830 --> 02:07:00.830
How to get over those roadblocks or around those roadblocks or through those

2108
02:07:01.021 --> 02:07:01.854
roadblocks.

2109
02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:07.020
Psychological warfare track that's going to be directed towards you or make you

2110
02:07:08.011 --> 02:07:12.310
talk about this stuff faster.
Okay.
Well,
here's the thing.
When I,

2111
02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:17.910
you know,
I come across this,
uh,
smart,
right?
Yeah.
See,

2112
02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:23.840
I feel compelled to share the valuable points that I think are valuable that

2113
02:07:24.991 --> 02:07:29.460
I've used or that I felt with each thing.
But then I'm like,
oh wait,

2114
02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:34.500
that'll take a long time to explain.
So sometimes like sometimes I go with it.

2115
02:07:34.501 --> 02:07:36.430
You don't seem to,
sometimes they don't,

2116
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:42.020
but today I'm giving you a down jacket.
No,
no,
no.

2117
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:47.530
I think it's valuable.
Okay,
we'll go with that.
Now Watch how fast I do this.
Yeah,

2118
02:07:47.531 --> 02:07:49.660
but you're not going to give him the whole thing.
You know,

2119
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:54.400
like the Jocko white tea.
You don't,
you didn't demonstrate.
Not Demonstrate.

2120
02:07:54.610 --> 02:07:56.370
Explain.
Yeah.

2121
02:07:56.371 --> 02:07:59.740
Did Jocko white tea guaranteed to get your dead lift to 8,000 pounds.
Boom.

2122
02:07:59.770 --> 02:08:01.300
That's it.
Done next.

2123
02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:06.220
There's three books you can get where the warrior kid gets kids on the path.

2124
02:08:06.370 --> 02:08:11.200
Boom.
Done.
Actually motor shop.
More bone.
That's cool.
No need.

2125
02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:12.461
I don't know men,

2126
02:08:12.461 --> 02:08:17.461
but I think like I read way the word kid to my daughter every single night.

2127
02:08:18.570 --> 02:08:21.760
It's one or two chapters,
not too long,
just one or two chapters.

2128
02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:24.460
So she wants to read the next chapter she wanted,

2129
02:08:24.461 --> 02:08:27.340
she wants me to read the next chapter that night.
I said no tomorrow.

2130
02:08:27.341 --> 02:08:30.070
She's looking forward to it every single night.
That's just the mantra.

2131
02:08:30.190 --> 02:08:35.140
The whole way of the warrior kid is just a background mood for life.

2132
02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:39.160
Yes.
Good thing to know.
Don't be weak like work hard,
all this stuff.

2133
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:40.690
What would explain that whole thing

2134
02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:45.170
does it cause that's the value that I got

2135
02:08:45.710 --> 02:08:46.640
<v 0>where the warrior kid,</v>

2136
02:08:46.670 --> 02:08:49.760
if you want a longer explanation you can email echo and he'll give it to you.

2137
02:08:49.761 --> 02:08:52.580
Extreme ownership.
Same thing.
Combat leadership for business and life.

2138
02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:54.800
That's new version.

2139
02:08:54.801 --> 02:08:59.060
Just came out has a little Q and a from you all from the podcast that's in
there,

2140
02:08:59.630 --> 02:09:03.290
so you can get that.
Also from an individual perspective,

2141
02:09:03.291 --> 02:09:07.310
discipline equals freedom field manual.
It's available everywhere.

2142
02:09:07.370 --> 02:09:10.670
There's no better gift than discipline.
The audio version of that,

2143
02:09:10.671 --> 02:09:15.350
which people ask me about a lot is not on audible.com it is on,

2144

2146
02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.580

also known as the monster.

2154

2155
02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:59.510
