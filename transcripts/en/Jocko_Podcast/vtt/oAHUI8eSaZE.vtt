00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.040
What advice would Jocko give his 17 year old self regarding school,

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.020
social relationships,
parents,
peer pressure,
et Cetera.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.360
Yes.

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.150
This is like the actual Jocko podcast tonight is all these questions are about

5
00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:17.290
Daca.
Actually,
that's kind of what I was asking,
like outside of the military,

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.720
you know,
if I was going to tell myself something,
here's a couple things,

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.060
know I would tell myself to detach.
I'll tell him,
tell him myself to learn that.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.020
I would tell myself that that girl isn't the whole world and those friends

9
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.020
aren't the last fringe are ever going to have and the party isn't going to be

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:37.830
the best party of all time and all those things that you think it was just what

11
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:38.611
we talked about earlier.

12
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:41.340
All of those things that you think are a huge deal when you're young,

13
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
they're not a big deal and I know that's kind of messed up,
but it's true,
man.

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.940
It's true.

15
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.910
The things that you think are a big deal when you're 17 years old or not that

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:55.911
big of a deal and it's really hard to convince someone that's 17 years old of

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.000
that.
Right.
They also also,

18
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:04.740
what they don't recognize is things that are a big deal.
They don't recognize.

19
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.400
They think they're a little deal.
They're doing stupid things,
right.

20
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.850
Whether it's drinking and driving weather,
I mean,

21
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.930
kids still drink and drive now.
Like how dumb is that?

22
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.590
Seems community.
And so people don't think,
you know,

23
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:21.600
nowadays we've talked about social media already too,

24
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:25.980
but people post stuff on social media and you see,
man,
what is wrong with you?

25
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.630
And I guess,
you know,
I've heard now and you know,

26
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.380
we work with a lot of different companies.
When you apply for a job,

27
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:35.340
they go and look at your social media and see what kind of an idiot you might
be.

28
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.470
That's a good move.
But Oh,
it's a great move.
It's a great move.
So,
um,
yeah,

29
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.573
just,

30
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.420
just recognize that some of the little things are actually big and some of the

31
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:47.820
big things are actually little.
And I'd square those things away.

32
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.510
And the UNFI said this before,
when you're young,

33
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.630
you've got to realize that how you act now is directly related to your future

34
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.520
success,
to your future happiness,
to your future.

35
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.860
Financial situation to everything.

36
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.070
So it's hard to make that connection.
Right.

37
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.300
We were young and possible might be impossible.
Some kids get it though.

38
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.080
I'm telling you.
Some kids get it.
I think they're just,
no,
some kids get it.

39
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:17.790
Some of my oldest daughter's friends,
they get it like they're on track,

40
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.310
they're on track,
they're there.
They're like,
Hey,
I'm doing this.
I'm doing that.

41
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.970
They're on track.
They're 16 years old.
They're studying for the sats,

42
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:30.090
they're taking the AP classes.
My daughter included,

43
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.210
like they're on track to make stuff happen.
Yeah.

44
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.840
But I think,
and I'm nothing,
this is the case,

45
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:41.730
but this is probably the case one way or another.
That could be wrong.

46
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.480
I understand.
But okay,
so we talked about this before.
You know,

47
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:47.980
that part of your brain that understands all that that you're talking about

48
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.480
isn't either developed,
you know,

49
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.510
and this is from what I understand how you can influence people.

50
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.970
You just put them on a routine,
kind of like,
okay.

51
00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:01.060
So it's the difference between understanding what I'm doing now and having a

52
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:05.360
tangible no.
Until I know where you're going with us.
And your,

53
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.740
I believe that there are definitely some kids like that that are just,

54
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.440
they're just like,
hey,
okay,
I'm supposed to get good grades.

55
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:12.400
I'm gonna could get grants.
I'm supposed to get there on that track.

56
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.710
I know for a fact kids that are like,
no,
I am going to do this,
this,
this,

57
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.510
and it's gonna lead me here.
Actually,
you know what,

58
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.150
you're right cause this is good.
Blake,
you know,
remember Blake,

59
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.440
he used to do videos for yeah.
So he,
we did like a thing where it was,

60
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.350
I think he's like a Q and a or something,
something like that.
And he was,

61
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
he was talking about that were in elementary school.

62
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:34.300
He remembers feeling like if,

63
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.330
if I don't have perfect attendance and have perfect straight A's,

64
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.890
I won't pass this not passed,
but I won't like be the perfect guy or whatever.

65
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.200
And he said that he would,
um,

66
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.340
it would like create like this track to his whole future in his life would be

67
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:54.300
ruined.
That's how he felt was like,
Whoa,
no,

68
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.390
I'm living like literally minutes,
a minute and third grade.

69
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.620
It'd be like the reason I wanted to do my homework and get good grades,

70
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.450
it's so I wouldn't get in trouble straight,
straight.

71
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.080
It was not to get into college or none of that stuff for sure.

72
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.970
And then get some way.
Most kids are,
in my opinion,
most kids are,
hey,

73
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.050
I don't want to get in trouble.
Some immediate repercussions,
myself included,
hey,

74
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.180
I got a pass this so I can go to the next grade.
Yeah.

75
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.600
We all know what I mean stuff.

76
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.640
Or I don't want to be the guy in class who didn't do his homework,
you know,

77
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:25.680
kind of thing.
It was like it was,

78
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.010
but yeah,
I guess so.
Yeah,
I guess so that's,
that's me trying to,

79
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.150
I got to step outside of myself on that one.
And I guess the final thing,

80
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.040
obviously I'd tell myself discipline equals freedom,

81
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.930
which is basically what we're saying.
Yeah.

82
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.520
Get disciplined in how you live your life and that I think the biggest one there

83
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.000
is to,
whether they totally understand that or not.

84
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.180
Say like what you're doing right right now is the important things in life.

85
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:00.440
The things that you think are important or not are not important.

86
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.120
And then things that aren't,
that you think are not in [inaudible] are important.

87
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.650
So it's kind of like a,
like an iceberg,
you know,
I'll be old,

88
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.880
you know the people that are four knots over that little statement you don't

89
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:11.830
want because people really like the way you say important.

90
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.090
You just said it eight times.
Flurry of glory and rainbows.

91
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.500
Emojis.
All right,
well hey,
I agree with you.
So like the iceberg thing,
you know,

92
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:25.930
you know the iceberg metaphor where it's like people only see the top of the

93
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:29.250
iceberg,
but below that is like this huge iceberg.
So that's what,

94
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.810
that's what important things are in life,
right?

95
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.150
So you think it's just this little small little iceberg.

96
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.360
But when you think of the whole scope of life,
which you have no access to,

97
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:41.080
by the way,
as a kid,
it's that whole iceberg,
you know?

98
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.010
So if you're not focusing on that important part of the iceberg,

99
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.940
well I guess an iceberg situation,
it's not that important,
but another metaphor.

100
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:53.740
But it will sink your ship.
Yeah.
You know,
like in that kind of situation.
Um,
but,

101
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:56.950
and then at the same time,
the things that aren't really important,

102
00:05:56.951 --> 00:05:58.890
meaning they don't have an iceberg under there.

103
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.510
They're just a little floaty things.
You think that's so important.

104
00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:04.600
Nothing's going to melt or get coffee or whatever,
you know,
knock on a scent.

105
00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:07.930
You know,
it's not going to think he's just trying to kind of,
it's a fleeting.
