This is Jocko podcast number one 35 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.440
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.853
<v 1>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.530
<v 0>dear Mrs. Spearing,</v>

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.300
there is grief in my heart and in the hearts of all my comrades for the great

6
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:27.110
sorrow that this war has brought to you and to us.

7
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.740
We all unite to express our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the mother and

8
00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:40.321
family of one who has fallen in a cause as imperishable as will be the names of

9
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:44.200
those who have fallen to defend it.

10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.560
Should there be anything my comrades and I can do to mitigate your grief.

11
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.430
<v 1>Okay,</v>

12
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.350
<v 0>and to allay your sorrow.</v>

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.040
Some little keepsake of Walt as a marine perhaps,

14
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.680
but name it dear lady

15
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.670
and it shall traverse the ocean to you.

16
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.233
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.180
<v 0>because you do not know me.
Please do not think it presumptuous for me to write.</v>

18
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.850
You are Walter's mother.

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.070
I was his inseparable friend and comrade

20
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.630
that makes us to kindred souls in common grief for our nearest and dearest.

21
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.830
Then to this letter fulfills my duty that I am bound by oath and will to

22
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:43.210
perform.
Many months ago,
Walton,

23
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.840
I promised each other that should the god of battles called to one.

24
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.170
The other would console the sorrowing mother.

25
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.603
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.830
<v 0>Now Walt has gone west to home and to you forever.</v>

27
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.240
<v 0>But his figure,
his voice,</v>

29
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.590
his wonderful personality will always be living truths to me.

30
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.740
I myself should the great call,
calm,

31
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.240
we'll go gladly

32
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.740
confident of a reunion and with faith in the eternal truth of that cause for

33
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:24.460
which I die

34
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.810
beneath the green and bellow woods forever connected to the honor of the

35
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:37.200
Marines,
lies waltz with his two comrades,

36
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.560
dead on the field of honor

37
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.620
above their graves.
The stately pines sway in their grand jury,

38
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.110
an imperishable monument,

39
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.770
but greatest of all epitaphs is that engraved within the hearts of his comrades,

40
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.540
a man then whom there was no PIR

41
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.620
in kindliness and understanding in comradeship beyond compare.

42
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.090
We alone know what could have been had circumstances,

43
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.430
so willed it,

44
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.530
whatever befall whatever sorrow fills us.

45
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.650
One thing I swear to you here,
hard by that lonely grave,

46
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.600
the very paper that I write upon taken in a captured German dug out.

47
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.530
I swear that Walt as well avenged that he has died.

48
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.000
Not In vain.

49
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.340
<v 0>For his spirit.
We just on two ultimate victory.</v>

51
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.780
<v 0>You aren't proud.
I know for you are the mother of a murder,</v>

53
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.060
a murder in a holy cause.

54
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.580
<v 1>Freedom
and liberty.</v>

55
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.850
<v 0>Dear Lady,
the very thought that you are in grief.</v>

56
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.530
Tears my heart.

57
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.740
Do not sorrow.

58
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.650
Death after all is not so terrible.
And here

59
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.950
why here
it is glorious.

60
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.143
<v 1>Okay</v>

61
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.073
<v 0>mother</v>

62
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.120
in the name of the 23rd company in the name of the Marines,

63
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.040
I salute you
and all my comrades salute you.

64
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.503
<v 1>Devotedly</v>

65
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.220
<v 0>Saul Segal.</v>

66
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.220
And that was a letter written by Saul Segal

67
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.590
who was in oh three 33 heavy machine gunner.

68
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.660
<v 0>And he was 20 years old when he wrote that letter at the graveside of his marine</v>

70
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:29.554
corps brother.

71
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.043
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.300
<v 0>To Walter spearing was his name,
who was from Philadelphia,</v>

73
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.020
who'd been amongst the earliest of the Marines to ship over the war.

74
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.760
And who was one of the 1,811 Americans killed at the battle of Bell Eau Wood.

75
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.483
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.530
<v 0>And Walter spearing died on June 26 1918 and as you said,</v>

77
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:02.891
that letter was written on captured paper from a German dug out and you're here

78
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:04.910
that writing,

79
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.023
<v 1>yeah,</v>

80
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.870
<v 0>that articulate that,</v>

81
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.930
that poetic writing by a 20 year old Marine Corps machine gunner

82
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.520
and it's a letter that captures

83
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.620
so many different aspects of war

84
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.930
and in capturing different aspects of war.
It teaches us,

85
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.750
teaches us about leadership.
It teaches us about human nature,

86
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.880
teaches us about suffering.
It teaches us about death.
I ended,
teaches us

87
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.303
about life

88
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.390
and tonight back here again to

89
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.400
talk to us about all those different subject as a marine that I was honored to

90
00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:10.161
serve with on the battlefield and who I am now honored to work with once again

91
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:12.540
on a different front.

92
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.190
His name is Dave Burke.
He's been on the podcast before already,

93
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.980
so if you haven't heard that one,

94
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.170
it was podcast number 69 and you should listen to that one first to hear about

95
00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:33.171
Dave's incredible background as a Marine Corps F 18 fighter pilot,

96
00:07:33.451 --> 00:07:38.190
F 16 pilot f 22 pilot f 35 pilot top gun pilot,

97
00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:41.220
topcon instructor,
top guns,
senior instructor,

98
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.460
and of course Anglico team leader on the ground with us in the battle of Ramadi.

99
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.820
And if you've listened to podcasts 69 then you can hear all about that.

100
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.790
And tonight we'll go a little deeper on all these different subjects.
Dave,

101
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.020
thanks for coming back on the show.
Thanks Jack.
I'm stoked to be here man.

102
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.990
You just find these letters like that and it's,
it's incredible.

103
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.940
I know.
I was like,
Hey,
read this.

104
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.750
And you know your reactions like this is a 20 year old marine.
Yeah.

105
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.490
Is it a different time?
Is it the language is different back then.

106
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.363
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

107
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.140
and the language is different and if you just hear the words,

108
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.810
it sounds like a completely different world.

109
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.160
And then when you think about what he's saying,
I know exactly what do you can,

110
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.800
you can feel what he's feeling and it comes through so,
so clearly.
And

111
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.290
I've read letters like that.
I've heard you read letters like that.

112
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:48.860
I've seen letters like that and I've written a letter like that.

113
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.280
It didn't sound that eloquent.
It didn't.
Um,

114
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.900
but I know that and it's incredible that after all this time how powerful that

115
00:08:57.901 --> 00:08:59.940
comes through,
man.
It was,
that's awesome.

116
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.430
<v 0>As you [inaudible] this is another thing that you and I were talking about,</v>

117
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.930
these lessons that exists in history,

118
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.300
in literature and,
and it's funny because it's,

119
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.040
it's things that are written by privates.

120
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.780
It's things that are written by corporals.

121
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.290
It's things that are written by majors and colonels and generals.

122
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:25.680
And it's things that are written by emperors and it's things that are written by

123
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.680
conscripts and everything in between.

124
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.160
And
every time I,
every time I,
even that right there,

125
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:40.161
it's like I get another angle to appreciate and to realize.

126
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.790
And then you start,
you know,
you started,

127
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.450
I'll cover Bellwood on this podcast for sure.
But I mean,

128
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:50.290
when you read about Bellwood at all,
it was just savage battle.
Yeah.

129
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.370
Savage battle.
I mean there's one medal of honor for,

130
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.170
for a guy that his buddy didn't have his gas mask,

131
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.530
so he took off his own gas mask and gave it to him and then,
and then died.

132
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.060
I mean it's,
it's,
it's unbelievable.

133
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.240
And so you were telling me you kind of opened it back up the history books,

134
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.720
the war books.

135
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.420
<v 2>Yeah.
I used to,</v>

136
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.450
certainly as a kid and an early in my career,

137
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.910
I would read military history all the time.
I mean,

138
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:23.280
some of them it was an assignment,
you know,

139
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:25.620
he'd become a lieutenant in the marine corps and there is a kind of a reading

140
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:27.960
list and you want to go through and you do,
some of it are kind of,

141
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.440
they call it professional military education PME.
Uh,

142
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:34.200
but I used to be really interested in it and I just kind of do it on my own.

143
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:37.620
A lot of it was aviation centric,
but I got away from it.

144
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.630
And for the latter half of my career,
I didn't do military history at all.
Uh,

145
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.540
it wasn't,
um,
it just wasn't something that really captivated me.

146
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.020
And in the last year and a half or so,

147
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.450
partially not partially,
mostly because of this podcast,

148
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.350
I've actually gone back and read,
read some of the books and,

149
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:01.440
and you and I've talked about it a lot of different ones.
Um,

150
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.130
with the old breed Eugene sledge.

151
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.850
So that was a book I read a long time ago and it was,
it was incredible book,

152
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:13.380
very powerful.
But I went back and reread that book a little while back

153
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.120
and I had stopped thinking and paying attention to the meanings I was,

154
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.830
I was,
I was almost paying attention to the chronology in the past,
okay,

155
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:28.350
this is happening here,
this is the lesson learned and this is the movement.

156
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:33.351
And it was all kind of very sanitary and I lost what it meant to hear their

157
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:35.220
stories.

158
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.810
And I used to read them and I think I just tried to pay attention to what

159
00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:44.010
happened and not really learn as much from him or from them.
And,

160
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.300
and I've read more in the last year than I had,

161
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.800
honestly,
docker,
py,
the previous five if not more.
Um,

162
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.980
and I'm reading

163
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.580
<v 0>all the time and I'm an,
and once you start sort of digging into that world,</v>

164
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.500
there's,
there's more books than I could ever read in my entire life.

165
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.140
They're everywhere.
Um,

166
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.530
and it has renewed the way I though how much I read,

167
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.710
but it's also changed the way I read.
It's been a really good experience for me.

168
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:18.370
I've learned a lot in the last year.
The,
uh,

169
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.550
and this is another thing that I talked to you about that as we were talking

170
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:26.551
about this subject the other day and I brought up this quote from Musashi.

171
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:29.170
Yeah.
And,
and the quote is,
if,

172
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:33.280
you know the way broadly you will see it and everything.

173
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.410
And to me that is what makes,
that is what has,

174
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.393
um,

175
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.090
I guess recalibrated reading for me is that when you start seeing all these

176
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:50.350
connections and everything,
and,
and part of it quite frankly,

177
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:54.190
comes from the fact that I wrote a book that is about this subject.

178
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.080
And once you go that deep in it,
it's like,
okay,
now I start seeing it everywhere.

179
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.590
And I mean even,
I kind of all started,

180
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.090
it definitely all started with about face for me with about face for me when I

181
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:11.830
was in Iraq and I knew,
I knew about face was a great book.

182
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:14.290
And this is,
this is on my second,
but on my first deployment,

183
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:17.340
my book was with the old breed as a matter of fact.
That was my book.
Yeah.

184
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.840
And I thought,
okay,
but it was so disconnected.
It was such a stretch.

185
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.010
I mean,
my first appointment to Iraq was absolutely,

186
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.960
absolutely nothing like with the old breed other,

187
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.410
the fact that we were American,
like the similarities ended there.

188
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.230
Right.
It was nothing like with the old breed,
nothing you know,

189
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.660
other than in my mind,
okay,
well these are horrible things that are happening.

190
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.990
You just,
it was really hard to make that connection.
I'll tell you what though,

191
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.200
our deployment to her Mahdi the similarities between Ramadi and and about face

192
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:55.420
were incredible.
Not just,
you know,

193
00:13:55.421 --> 00:14:00.190
one of the things that hit me right out of the gate is when Hackworth gets to

194
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:04.060
Vietnam and those guys were getting killed and they're getting killed by sniper

195
00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:06.880
fire,
indirect fire and booby traps,

196
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.310
which we now call ids for whatever reason.

197
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.390
And that one section in the book where they've taken hundreds,

198
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.670
like a hundred something casualties,
and they've,
and they've,

199
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.450
they've contacted the enemy's zero times entity.

200
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.190
It's an enemy killed zero.
And I'm thinking to myself,
this is a nightmare.

201
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.800
This is a nightmare.
And that nightmare,

202
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.850
it shows itself over and over and over again.

203
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.440
And what's so hard is,
and I'll tell you where he hit me again,

204
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.620
it hit me again on,
on Lewis Polar,

205
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:44.070
when Lewis Puller is rotating between the three different sections in one of

206
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:49.330
them was called Riviera.
And he's saying every time they go into Riviera,

207
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.510
they take wounded or they take killed.
And on top of that,

208
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.710
they don't ever see the enemy.
And I'm thinking to myself,

209
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.770
it's maddening,
right?
It's maddening when you look back and you're detached,

210
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:07.700
which were detached now.
And I don't know if culture's different.

211
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.350
I don't know if our culture is different.

212
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.640
I don't know if we value human life more.

213
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:17.390
I don't know that.
But when you read it,

214
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.700
it's maddening to think about that.
And you could see that like Hackworth who he,

215
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:27.170
he didn't like that.
He didn't like that at all.
And that was all that was,

216
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.320
I think maybe it was you that told me when I had Jim Akiyama on and,

217
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.390
or a couple people told me they were like,
you sounded diddy.
Yeah.

218
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.880
And I said,
well,
yes,
I was giddy and,
and here I was.

219
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.590
But it was very interesting to go and talk to Mooky Yama because what was

220
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:51.860
interesting to me is you,
you,
there's the,

221
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:54.650
there's the public persona of some guy that was in the military,
right?
Right.

222
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.950
There's the public persona of some guy that was in the military,
myself included,

223
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.070
you,
all of us.
There's that public persona of,
Oh,

224
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:03.920
this is what this guy is perceived as.
But then there's like,
okay,

225
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:06.350
what about all the people that served with that person?

226
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:11.351
What do they really think and what was Hackworth really like?

227
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.500
And so going to meet moocs.
I was very curious.

228
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:20.501
Now I had read an interview with him where I knew that he had these very,

229
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:26.000
he held him in the highest esteem.
They didn't come as a surprise to me,

230
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.500
but still it was,

231
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.560
it was incredible that the perception that I had of Hackworth was accurate.

232
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.450
It was accurate.
And when you,
when you,
when you heard mark talk about it,

233
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.670
when he said,
we called the Mr Infantry,
I,
I,

234
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.250
I was just thinking to myself,

235
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.280
is there any thing cooler in the world than to be known throughout the army as

236
00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:57.050
Mr Infantry?
Yeah.
You said something that,
that,

237
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.900
that jumped out at me a little bit.
You were,
you were just talking about,

238
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.130
you know,
is,
is culture different?
Something different.

239
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.750
So let me just say this a little bit because you know,

240
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:11.480
I've even thought a little bit about why do I see things differently than I used

241
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:13.340
to?
What,
why have I evolved in a certain way?

242
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:16.220
So did I spend 23 years in the Marine Corps,

243
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.990
23 years as a US marine and a whole bunch of years just wanting to be a marine.

244
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.480
I was in Ramadi for seven months.

245
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.840
So if you just kind of do the math,
it's just not a lot of time.

246
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:36.380
Everything I think about every leadership lesson,

247
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:39.230
every when I hear you talk about a book,
when I read a book,

248
00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:42.620
when I think all of those things,
the frame of reference I had,

249
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:44.870
the thing I think about is those seven months.

250
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.070
And had I not had those seven months of,
and

251
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.120
<v 2>look,
Ramadi obviously was,
it was a maddening place.
It was crazy.</v>

252
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.370
Um,
but if I didn't have that,

253
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.050
I don't think I would be able to appreciate or understand and without that frame

254
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:04.740
of reference,
without that understanding of some connection to that,

255
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.220
it actually makes it difficult.
And I would've never guessed it.

256
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:09.054
If I were to tell you,
hey,

257
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.250
I'm going to look back in my 23 year career and all those things,

258
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:14.130
I heard you listened to my bio.
It's always strange to hear someone read it out.

259
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.830
The,
the,
the,

260
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.120
the most powerful thing in that was seven months in Ramadi,

261
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.830
w that's the thing that outshines all of it because of what you just described

262
00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:30.630
because of that feeling.
Um,
and I don't know if it's that,

263
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.790
that that culture is different or society's differently.

264
00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:36.090
We have different values that we value human life different differently.

265
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.510
But without the frame of reference,
it can be hard to capture.

266
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.040
But if you start to think of it in,
in a different way,

267
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:45.840
and that's sort of what that quote means.

268
00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:49.590
And I know this is kind of a deep thought,
but that's,

269
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.480
you see things differently and you think about things that,

270
00:18:53.481 --> 00:18:55.260
and you start to see things you didn't even know were there before.

271
00:18:55.261 --> 00:18:57.120
And that's why when I went back and read,
look,

272
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.000
I've read a book and I read the exact same book again,

273
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:06.150
and to see and hear and understand things differently the second time when a

274
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:09.000
book,
that was the end for me,
for me it was with the old way.

275
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.880
That was the book that sort of hit me square.
I got to go to Okinawa,

276
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:16.020
I got to walk that ground that and to go back and reread that book recently and

277
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:19.350
have it seemed so different.
That has really stuck with me.

278
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.040
And that was sort of the reason why I got back into reading some of them the

279
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:24.330
same books and some,
some are different,

280
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.440
but there is something about that perspective that changes you.

281
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:30.930
And I would have never guessed that throughout my career.

282
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.830
I always wanted to be a pilot.
It's delivering,
really wanted to do that.

283
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:39.180
I would sort of define my experience based on those seven months and how that

284
00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:40.740
influenced everything that I see now.

285
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.950
And the weird thing is about Rahmati is when you compare Ramadi to pell Lou,

286
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.710
you compare Ramadi to Okinawa,
you compare Ramadi to Normandy,

287
00:19:52.711 --> 00:19:56.490
you compare Ramadi to,
you compare Ramadi to those places.

288
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.360
And our experience was just,

289
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.180
it just pales.
It just absolutely pails.
Yeah.

290
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.380
You and I have talked about this a lot.
Um,
you actually sent me,

291
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.250
I think he sent me a text or an email a couple of weeks ago.
You're like,
Hey,

292
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:14.070
do me a favor.
Um,
just verify.
I got this right.

293
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:17.760
I wanted just to make sure I got your combat experience,
um,
in,

294
00:20:17.761 --> 00:20:19.590
in your first deployment.
Correct.

295
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.500
And it was that I was in combat in Iraq and I was thinking,
yeah,
yeah,
no,

296
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:30.180
you've got it all right.
I,
I,
I dropped a bomb
that was my car.

297
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.760
That was a legitimate combat experience before.

298
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:34.590
That's pre nine 11 or pre nine 11.

299
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.890
And we're one of the few guys with combat combatants.
Yeah.

300
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.970
You had dropped a bomb bomb singular and I,

301
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.570
the thought wasn't just how ridiculous that sounds,
but I thought,

302
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.090
I don't ever Charlie plummer,
bill reader to hear me say that.

303
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.680
I don't want them to almost embarrassed.
And,

304
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.290
and even like you said,
Ramadi,
w w which for me,

305
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:59.650
which was sort of like the world series and the Superbowl combined into one,

306
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:03.370
like the most powerful thing.
And with the old breed,

307
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.480
since we've been talking about that,

308
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.530
you talk about the battle of Okinawa and what they endured.

309
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.770
I mean,
it is so humbling and almost honestly man,

310
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.450
downright a little embarrassing to try to share the same experience.

311
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.530
We saw that with Tom five and I remember Tom five was on the podcast and he was

312
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:24.520
so grateful for,
for,

313
00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:27.400
he was thanking me for what we had done and what we accomplished.

314
00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:32.401
And I'm thinking this is a man that has a purple heart from World War II,

315
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.300
Korea and Vietnam and he's thanking me for what I did.

316
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.330
And um,
you know,
that's,

317
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.290
that's a frame of reference that I think is important and something that podcast

318
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:45.490
does is so extreme.
The wells,

319
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:48.280
it gives those guys a chance to share that story at that.

320
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:53.080
Otherwise they wouldn't get a chance to.
Is there a way to get,

321
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.400
I'm trying to figure out what I was missing,
right.
I was trying to fit,

322
00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.253
I'm trying to figure out what,

323
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.320
how can you get somebody that's a 18 year old corporal to read a book with the

324
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:08.860
perspective,
the,
with the right perspective.
Is that possible

325
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.660
at 18 year old day,
Burke,
it wasn't possible.
I can tell you that for sure.

326
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:17.820
It wasn't.
Um,
and I,

327
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.710
I don't know if that,
if that's the case,

328
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.280
but I do know that if you get an 18 year old de Burgh agent or anybody to to

329
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:33.880
start to read it,
start to think about it,
that actually builds over time.

330
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.510
And that creates some sort of foundation that I think with time of perspective,

331
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:44.200
you can actually reach those,
reach that.
But there's no way at that age,

332
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.420
no matter what you said,
no matter how articulate you are,

333
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:50.590
no matter how powerful the story was,
I don't think you're reaching me.

334
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.120
And I don't mean that to be discouraging,

335
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:57.520
but I think that's a hard lesson.
I think you know,

336
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.830
for certainly what I was going through at that time of my life,

337
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.970
it's just not going to happen.
It's going to,
yeah,

338
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.751
it's when it's too,

339
00:23:07.751 --> 00:23:11.110
cause what you're focused on when your ATM and you read with the old breed,

340
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.330
you're like,

341
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.330
like I remember my earliest memories of with the old breed are these guys were

342
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:23.110
ripping people's gold teeth with pliers.
You're thinking,
whoa,

343
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.930
that's crazy.
Like,
that's the big,
that's,

344
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.710
that's probably the big takeaway from my first read when I was whatever years

345
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:31.480
old yep.
Of with the old breed.

346
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.880
It's you,

347
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.230
you see it for the things that seem not real and you're like,
man,

348
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:41.140
that is incredible in that as awesome.
And um,

349
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.950
I also think that goes to the,
you talked about this a lot,
that,
that sort of,

350
00:23:44.951 --> 00:23:49.640
that feeling of invincibility too when you're young and they'd like immune to

351
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.770
not just the physical risks,

352
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.430
not just the potential of getting hurt or getting injured or getting shot or

353
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:56.151
some of those worse things,

354
00:23:56.151 --> 00:24:00.380
but the mental and emotional risks that go along with experiencing that.

355
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.500
Um,
that's a really hard lesson.

356
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.690
Now the other side of that is,
you know,
when I deployed to Ramadi,

357
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:14.300
almost everybody on my team was a first appointment brand new,

358
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.070
young US marine.
Um,
you met Marcus Perez,
he came to,
uh,

359
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.810
the muster,
you know,
he was a young kid.
Uh,

360
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.320
and you walk in there sort of with this kind of,

361
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:29.930
this bulletproof approach.
And

362
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.290
it's not how it is when you leave.
It's not the same.
And in some ways,

363
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:37.850
like you said,
the scale is,

364
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.910
is different than a Manoppello Lou or Guadalcanal or any of those things,

365
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:46.790
you know,
that that we just talked about.
But when it's happening to you,

366
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.410
it's,
it could be a single round,
a single mortar,
a single shot,
a single wound.

367
00:24:51.411 --> 00:24:52.640
If it's happening to you,

368
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.650
it sort of feels like it's happening to the whole world.
It's really impactful.

369
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.550
And that's probably why,
if I look back on my career,

370
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.100
the thing that's the most powerful experience that I had,

371
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:07.120
that sort of outshines everything,
bye bye so much is,

372
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.570
is that time in Ramadi because I was exposed to things that I never saw as a

373
00:25:11.571 --> 00:25:14.600
pilot and never would have seen had I not been on that deployment.

374
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.800
You know what I was,
I was thinking.
So one of the things,
and I remember probably,

375
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.380
I don't know if it was 10 or 15 podcasts deep into into this podcast,

376
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.450
I remember saying during one of the podcasts,

377
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.880
and,
and I've said it a few times along the way,

378
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.910
I remember saying that these people that I'm talking about in these books,

379
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.760
they're not characters.
These are people.

380
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:45.970
And I think at some point for me that transition in my brain happened where I

381
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:50.270
was saying to myself,
these are,
these are people.

382
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.900
And I think I got a little bit of it in my platoon commander tour because you

383
00:25:55.941 --> 00:26:00.330
know,
there was a,
it was a,
it was a good solid deployment.
Was there risk?

384
00:26:00.331 --> 00:26:03.050
Sure there was rescue.
It wasn't super high risk.
I had,

385
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.940
I had a great crew of guys,
but you know,
there was,

386
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.920
there was stress and there was personalities.

387
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.550
And you start to see that when you read about a guy and you think,

388
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:13.670
I kind of know that guy,
just,
I just know him a little bit.

389
00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:14.750
I just know him a little bit.
And,

390
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.370
and you start to realize that those people in these books,
they're real people.

391
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:25.090
And I think that for me was a huge leap between connecting me to the text that I

392
00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:28.784
was reading.

393
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:33.910
And I'll tell you another thing and straight up voice w w w when I started

394
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.340
thinking about reading these things,
when I started reading these aloud,

395
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.010
when I started reading them and hearing them in my own headset,

396
00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.550
like on the podcast,

397
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.820
<v 0>that was an impact.
And,
and now it's happened.</v>

398
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:50.640
It happened with bill reader happened with Jody Mitic had happened when these

399
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:55.530
guys come on here and they hear me read what they wrote and it hits them.

400
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.990
And so that's another part of it too.

401
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.330
There is an element when you read that's missing.

402
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.520
There is an element of voice that is just more powerful.

403
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.930
It's just more powerful.
And I remember when I read the forgotten Highlander,

404
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.500
when I read that book,
I read it on the plane coming back,

405
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:18.060
calling a guy over in Scotland,
a buddy of mine who I'd done some work with.

406
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.570
He gave me this book and I was on podcast 11 and he goes,
hey,

407
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:24.510
you gotta check out this book.
I won't try and do a Scottish accent.

408
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:27.190
Plus he's a Mumbler Hema.
Like there you go to check up to the book.

409
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.200
And so he gives me this book and I'm sort of thinking,
okay,
you know,
I just,

410
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.610
I wasn't sure,

411
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:37.610
but I had made enough of a enough of a leap in my brain that when I started

412
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:41.910
reading that book,
I said to myself,
wow,
this is going to be,

413
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.660
this is going to be a really powerful podcast.
So I read the book.

414
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.810
So then when we come,
this is podcast number 12 when we can't,

415
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:53.100
when I came in to record it,
I thought,
yeah,
this is going to be really heavy.

416
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.000
But when I read it,
it was like I was getting hit in the head with,

417
00:27:57.001 --> 00:27:58.170
with a sledge hammer.

418
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:03.000
And that's the first podcast that when I got to the end of the book,

419
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.030
I actually didn't know what to say because what do you say?

420
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.260
What do you say about a guy that,
what do you say about a guy that,
that,

421
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:15.690
that put maggots on his flesh to eat away the dead flesh.

422
00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.390
What do you say about that?
What do you say about that?

423
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.680
And so that's the first podcast where I said when I got done with it,

424
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.100
the next time I did a podcast that was heavy like that,

425
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.300
I knew that I had to get myself some weird to go.

426
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.010
I had to give myself some fought about how am I going to make this?

427
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:39.230
How does this become something?
How do I,

428
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.240
how do I get out of this hole?
Cause that's what,
that's what you're doing.

429
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.470
And so there's a level of that as well.
When you hear,

430
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.130
like when you hear a hardcore history podcast,
you'd get great storytelling,

431
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.050
but he's reading quotes from people.

432
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.700
But it's so much more powerful when you hear it audibly.
And we,
you know,

433
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.250
people say that about extreme ownership to people say,
Oh yeah,

434
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:00.270
I love that book and this,
and we'll say,

435
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:04.680
you got to get the audio audio cause it's Lafe and I reading it and you can
hear,

436
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.610
I mean how much is communicated in the tone of voice.
There's a lot

437
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:15.630
when you said earlier about the,
the audible piece of that

438
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.860
when you finish my first podcast.
So when I was on,
it was,

439
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.860
we were talking about this almost a year and a half ago now,
you know,

440
00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:24.270
April I think of last year,
I guess

441
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:30.830
you finished with a letter that cat wrote to Chris.

442
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.770
Now I didn't know we hadn't discussed that and I didn't know how it was going to

443
00:29:34.771 --> 00:29:37.380
finish and uh,
you know,
we spent all that time,
you know,

444
00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:40.830
talking about me and my experiences and things like that.
I knew that letter.

445
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.100
Well I have a copy of that

446
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.010
<v 2>letter and I've read that letter several times.</v>

447
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.470
I had never read that letter out loud to myself.
I never read a tender.

448
00:29:50.471 --> 00:29:52.930
But as I've shared it with Whitney and I've shared that letter.

449
00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.493
<v 3>Okay.</v>

450
00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:00.500
<v 2>Hearing you say a letter that I knew almost line by line.</v>

451
00:30:00.501 --> 00:30:05.390
I know that letter really well made that letter like I'd never heard it before

452
00:30:05.391 --> 00:30:07.160
and I remember it.
Look,

453
00:30:07.161 --> 00:30:10.070
it's hard to hear it because it's Chris and it's hard for me because that's a

454
00:30:10.071 --> 00:30:13.310
really impactful thing,
very emotional thing,
and that is a,

455
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.280
that's a crusher for me,
man.
I know you understand that,

456
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:20.720
but I had never heard it out loud.
And in,

457
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:26.380
there's a book I'm reading now that I have read the preface of the book,

458
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.460
which is only about three pages kind of just explained.

459
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:33.290
I've read it out loud to myself like five times,
and it,

460
00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:33.890
it's,

461
00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:38.890
it's something that I overlooked the impact of hearing it as opposed to reading.

462
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.470
And I read the book and really cool buck.
I think I sent you,
this book's awesome.

463
00:30:42.471 --> 00:30:44.360
You should check it out.
I read the,
the,

464
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.570
the preface out loud to myself and having him read it three or four times

465
00:30:47.571 --> 00:30:50.120
already hearing it,
it was like reading it for the first time.
The,

466
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.460
the voice that you give that makes,

467
00:30:52.461 --> 00:30:56.160
it makes the words become real.
Like,
uh,

468
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.090
like that person who wrote the book is saying out loud.

469
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.110
And that difference there,
it's not subtle.
It's huge.

470
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.730
It's a huge,

471
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.170
huge thing that that is one of the great things about when people do it.

472
00:31:09.171 --> 00:31:12.170
When they do it on podcasts and you're putting somebody else's voice into
action,

473
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.560
most of the time we're reading books by people that are long gone.
Uh,

474
00:31:15.561 --> 00:31:18.350
and you're telling stories that nobody would ever hear.

475
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.450
And even if you read them,
it misses something.
And,

476
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.220
and I think the power of that is huge.

477
00:31:22.221 --> 00:31:24.680
And it brought me right back to our last podcast,

478
00:31:24.681 --> 00:31:29.420
which was you sitting right where you are reading cats letter to Chris.

479
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:33.470
And as it,
like I said,
like I had never heard it before.
It was,

480
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.630
it's a totally different level.

481
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.130
You know what a podcast
was.

482
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.360
Another podcast that,

483
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.540
that sort of caught me was,
uh,

484
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.090
one soldiers war by,
um,

485
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.280
our Katie and that part in the end of that podcast where it's,

486
00:31:59.671 --> 00:32:04.260
again,
that was podcast number 18.
And he's,

487
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:04.950
he's,

488
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:09.780
he's quoting these wounded soldiers that were sitting begging for money

489
00:32:09.781 --> 00:32:11.370
basically.
And

490
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.890
he's talking about how this guy is saying,
you know,

491
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.170
if I would kill all these,
he's talking about this,

492
00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:22.140
this soldiers talking about everyone on the streets in Moscow.
He says,

493
00:32:22.141 --> 00:32:26.010
I would kill every one of these people to bring back my brothers.

494
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.450
You're reading this going,
oh good God.
That is a powerful,

495
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:35.610
powerful book.
Did you see him in the news recently?
No.
He faked his own death.

496
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.340
Oh yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.
Yes.
All of these people we talked about it.
He did.

497
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.080
They hit me up on social media and I was all,
man,
what a travesty.
And yeah,

498
00:32:44.081 --> 00:32:48.050
it was totally bummed out and then sure enough he had faked his own death.

499
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.500
He even food his wife and tell his wife that's,

500
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.670
that takes a lot of courage.
He's a courageous guy already.
But yeah,

501
00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:00.010
to fake your death and not give your wife a heads up about it.
That's,

502
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.460
that's hardcore.
That that's problematic.
Yeah.
And,
and that,

503
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.550
that feeling too,
it's one thing to sort of have that feeling,

504
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:09.710
but to be willing to express that feeling of that,

505
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.710
I would do that to all of these people.

506
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.150
That is,
that's it.
That's saying a lot,
man.
I mean,

507
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:19.430
that is deep to to,
I mean,

508
00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:22.760
I've had some pretty hardcore thoughts certainly in my time.
Like,
no,
I'm fine.

509
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:26.810
I can share that one.
Uh,
but to put it out there,
you know what I mean?
That's,

510
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.380
that gets to the core of,
of just how,

511
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.440
how much people feel from those experiences,

512
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:37.610
just how powerful those feelings are.
And those guys had no mercy.
Those,

513
00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.910
those Russian soldiers,
they had no mercy.
It was that,

514
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:44.540
that part where he's talking about the sergeants beat the corporals,

515
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.020
the captains beat the sergeants,
the majors beat the captain's.
Yeah.

516
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.860
It's just a nightmare.
Yeah.
It's just a complete nightmare.

517
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.480
It makes you wonder how any of that is,
is makes any remotely functional.

518
00:33:56.481 --> 00:34:00.140
Like how does that system function at all under that setting,

519
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.040
under that environment.

520
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:06.430
How could anybody at the bottom of that hierarchy be willing to go do any of the

521
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:10.590
things they went and did you know you,
you're talking about,
you know the,

522
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.510
this thing from,
from bell eau wood there,

523
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.540
they literally know most of you are going to die.

524
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.650
We're going to charge across open fields into machine guns.
We use that example.

525
00:34:20.651 --> 00:34:23.990
That echelon front is something that you would never do.

526
00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:28.970
And that's what they were doing.
I mean,
borderline,
just human waves.

527
00:34:28.971 --> 00:34:33.800
If we do it enough,
we're going to get 50,
75 yards of terrain out of it.

528
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.610
We're going to move the line forward a hundred yards and we're going to send a

529
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.380
wave after wave after wave two.

530
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.310
And guys who lived right like this is Bert borderline a death sentence.

531
00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.260
Um,
what,

532
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.990
what people are capable of doing and under those environments is,
is unreal.

533
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.160
Sometimes World War One,
it just is.
It's just,

534
00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:00.380
you know,
it's,
you know what's funny is I say that about everyone,
every war.

535
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.420
So the board were like unbelievable.
And then you,

536
00:35:03.421 --> 00:35:06.440
you talked about Napoleon and like nothing like that.

537
00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:11.441
And then I read the book on the coldest a war or a colder than hell.

538
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.470
I'm like,
no,
nothing like that.
Like there is,

539
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.650
there is something that has happened in every one of the stories that you've

540
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:21.650
talked about or I think how is that possible?

541
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.710
And they all have their own unique thing about them that just seems unreal.

542
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.160
I'm going to throw in an orange vest and mark by position in 30 below so you can

543
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:37.680
see me so you know where I am because I'm the leader because I'm the leader and

544
00:35:37.681 --> 00:35:38.100
you get

545
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.180
<v 0>Lee.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Unreal.</v>

546
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.600
That being said,
World War One,
no,

547
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.990
I don't.
I don't know that,
that,

548
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.810
I don't know that that is out there.

549
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:57.500
The the complete lack of control that you had as a individual soldier.

550
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:02.760
Yeah.
As a,
even as a platoon commander,

551
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.360
as a company commander,
you had no control over your fate.
That's,

552
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.370
that's what scares me so much about world war one.
It wasn't like,
Hey Jocko,

553
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:14.790
here's,
here's,
here's the situation,
here's what we're trying to accomplish.

554
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.570
Why don't you go figure out the best way to do it?
And I go,
okay,
you know what,

555
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:21.060
cool,
I can do this.
We can,
we can come up with some cool tactics.

556
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.640
We can make some stuff happen.
It was,
hey,

557
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:28.730
tomorrow morning at zero 614,000 of us are going to go at zero 600 and then

558
00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:35.620
guess what's going to happen to zero six 15 another 14,000 yeah,

559
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.020
and guess what's going to happen to zero six 30 another 14,000 and guess what?

560
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.260
Of vast majority.
Then we're going to be wounded or killed and that's that.

561
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.670
So that that to me and,
and I'll tell you what

562
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.030
they call that,
the war to end all wars.

563
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:55.830
I think if there would have been internet

564
00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.280
photographers,
Instagram,
Twitter,
youtube,

565
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.610
that might have been the last war,
right?
That might've been the last war.

566
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.470
If you were a,

567
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.740
and it's not that if you saw that as a leader because I'm just,

568
00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:13.871
when I think about it,

569
00:37:13.871 --> 00:37:17.640
I think about it like you're a general and you're in charge and you organize

570
00:37:17.641 --> 00:37:20.310
this big operation and then you,

571
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:25.450
you give the execute order and then 22,000 men are killed in the first 24 hours.

572
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.610
Who does that?
Who does that now?

573
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.441
And this is,

574
00:37:34.441 --> 00:37:38.550
this is a dichotomy because are there situations where people have done

575
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:42.150
operations and are there situations that warm that it's like,
hey,
guess what,

576
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.420
we are going to do this mission and we don't have a real good chance of coming

577
00:37:45.421 --> 00:37:47.040
back.
And that's the way it is.

578
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.710
And it's a strategic piece of the mission and it,

579
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.300
does that happen?
Could that happen?
Absolutely.

580
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.330
And do people in the military sign up for that?
Would I sign up for that?

581
00:37:57.331 --> 00:38:00.060
If that was what was required?
Well yeah,
that's what we signed up for.

582
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:06.330
But it has a leader like that to be sitting there looking at 25,000 men and you

583
00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:07.320
gained,
you know,

584
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:12.180
75 yards of mud and you know what?
You Go,

585
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:15.600
okay,
that was bad.
We're not going to do that again.
No,
no,
no.

586
00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:19.350
You know what you say,
you know what,
we'll do it harder.
Right.
We'll do it harder,

587
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.230
which is,
which is what makes me,

588
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.960
it makes that war to me just absolutely sickening.

589
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.770
It's sickening.
It is.
It absolutely is.

590
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.220
And the calculus that goes into that is something

591
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.800
<v 2>is completely disconnected from the value of human life.</v>

592
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.650
Completely disconnected of what that impact is.
And then you,

593
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.540
you read this letter,

594
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:45.040
<v 1>okay.</v>

595
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.880
<v 2>And that's 14,000 moms</v>

596
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.760
on that one wave,
that one time.

597
00:38:52.761 --> 00:38:56.570
That's 14,000 of these letters and uh,

598
00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.610
the disconnect of,
of human life.
Um,
yeah.
It's,
it's an,
it's actually hard,

599
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:04.010
kind of hard to fathom.
You you talked about,
you know,
yeah.

600
00:39:04.011 --> 00:39:06.910
The high risk operation,
you know,
we're going to go in,
uh,

601
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.300
into the worst possible situations cause yeah.
And you know what?

602
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:16.010
We all kind of secretly would say,
Hey,
I'm the volunteer for that.
You know,

603
00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:20.930
the high risk,
but as as it,
that's just how we do operations all the time.

604
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.730
That's just what we do.
Yeah,
no,
that's a,
that's a,

605
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.040
that's actually a nightmare.
Yeah.

606
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.470
In the other thing with World War One,
right?

607
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.610
Like World War II,
you're looking at Nazis.
Yeah.

608
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.900
And you're looking at the imperial Japanese army and you're thinking,

609
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.220
we've got real bad guys here.
We got legit bad guys.

610
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:53.800
That's,
that's a factor too,
right?
It Germany,

611
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.310
World War One.
It's like,
well yeah,
we want it a little extra land.

612
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.710
Who's that land for?
You know what I talk about with you?
Don't worry.

613
00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.300
We will work with companies.
And I say,
so,

614
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.820
okay.
CEO says,
I,
you know,

615
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:10.900
my frontline troops aren't doing what they're supposed to do and it's affecting

616
00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:13.420
our bottom line.
And you know,
ask them,
oh,

617
00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:16.300
well you gotta explain to them why it's important.
Right.

618
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.940
And sort of then see yoga goes down and says,
hey,

619
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.120
you guys need to do a better job on the front lines so that the company can be

620
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:27.010
more profitable.
And the frontline people are like,
we don't care if it call you.

621
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.530
That doesn't mean that doesn't matter to me.
Yeah.
I'm making 17 bucks,

622
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.820
17 bucks an hour,

623
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.130
and I got a wife and I've got a kid and I got a basketball game tonight and

624
00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:37.120
we've got a mortgage and I got a house payment.
The company and being profitable,

625
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:39.270
it makes no difference to me whatsoever.
Yeah.

626
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:44.370
So imagine now your World War One and you're going to get an extra 14 miles of

627
00:40:45.431 --> 00:40:46.264
land.

628
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:51.330
That's the goal to get 14 miles of land in some country and it's not for you.

629
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.700
It's for like the government.
Yeah.
It's,
yeah.

630
00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:01.540
It's absolutely,
it's atrocious.
Yeah.
And,

631
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.600
and when you're sending US marines across the Atlantic Ocean to get engaged in

632
00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:12.181
that war is like to keep Germany from encroaching a little bit too far west.

633
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:18.430
You know Brian France.
Yeah,
maybe.
Yeah.
The,
the wide isn't,

634
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.760
that doesn't,
that doesn't resonate.
They have.
I,
have I ever talked about it?
Do,

635
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.590
I don't know if I've talked about,

636
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.530
have I ever talked about the white flower thing?
They didn't in Britain,

637
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.873
the white flour.

638
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.230
So if you were like a able bodied young man,

639
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.750
if you were a military age male,
yeah.
And,

640
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.030
and you weren't wearing a uniform and you weren't like fighting,

641
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.540
women would come up and give you a white flower.

642
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:46.220
It was the mark of shame and the government started that campaign.

643
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.970
Yeah.
The government started that campaign of,
Hey,
you see,

644
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.360
you see someone that's not in uniform military age,

645
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:57.650
male able bodied fighting man.
You go up and give him a white flower.

646
00:41:57.651 --> 00:42:00.890
He's a coward.
Um,

647
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.940
I'm prepping a book right now for the podcast and actually a couple of books,

648
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:09.970
but it's a nightmare because what they're doing is they're,

649
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:16.180
they're executing British soldiers that have that,

650
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.050
that,
that dessert or run away or have shell shock.
Yeah.

651
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:25.490
They're just dysfunctional.
They can't do it anymore.
And it's,
it's awful.

652
00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:26.390
Some of the stories.

653
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.490
These guys are soldiers that had been on the line for a year and they break the

654
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:36.380
break,
which everyone,
um,
Dick winters talks about.

655
00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:38.090
People braved the bravest guys he had.

656
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:42.140
They might break and you've got to get them off the wide Hackworth.
Same thing.

657
00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:43.980
You've got brave guys sometimes you've got to get him off the line.

658
00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.030
World War One,
we got a British soldier.

659
00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:50.450
He's been fighting for a year in the trenches.
He's been getting mortared.

660
00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:54.080
He's been getting bombed that he'd says,
I can't do this anymore.
Okay,

661
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:58.700
we're going to shoot you at dawn.
And they did it.
Yeah.
That's another thing.

662
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:02.390
It's completely insane.
Yeah.
We use the analogy a lot.

663
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.990
We talked about this additional in front.
You're like,
Hey,

664
00:43:03.991 --> 00:43:06.290
it's your folks when you're pushing your folks too hard.
It's like,

665
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.230
it's like driving a car in the red.
You were running this car in the red.

666
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:12.080
You're running them hard and if you keep them in the red too long,

667
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.620
that car's going to break that and then she's going to break.
Now you can,

668
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.380
you can push to the red a little bit.
You can kind of throttle up and,

669
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.880
and do that.
And then you got to bring them back.

670
00:43:19.881 --> 00:43:22.310
And that's sort of one of the leader's job is that it sort of pay attention to

671
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:23.330
that.
And this is the idea of like,

672
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.320
I'm going to run my car in the red until my car explodes and then I'm going to

673
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:31.590
be mad at the car.
I'm gonna blame the car.
Uh,
and the,

674
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.140
the disconnect of the,
and we'd,

675
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.600
like you said that the disconnect of the impact of the human being that,
that,

676
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.470
that that's what leaders are supposed to do.
That's their job is to,

677
00:43:42.471 --> 00:43:46.580
and Dick winters had that he talked about the idea of like,
hey,
when,

678
00:43:46.581 --> 00:43:50.060
when somebody puts their head in their hands that's,
they live physical,

679
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:54.050
they're literally showing you,
hey man,
um,
I'm breaking right now.

680
00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.740
And the willingness to just say,

681
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.360
go do it again and then get to the point of like,
I can't,
and then go,

682
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.740
we're done with you.
We don't have any more use for you anymore.
Yeah.
Um,

683
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.540
that's hard to comprehend.
It's hard to comprehend.
But like I said,

684
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:14.020
I'm prepping these books.
It's awful to read them.
It's awful to read them.

685
00:44:14.021 --> 00:44:18.140
Some of them are of the quotes from the soldiers that were chosen to be the

686
00:44:18.141 --> 00:44:22.520
executioners,
right?
I mean,
well,
what's that?
What's that?

687
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.060
I remember I started one podcast off of that was like the soldiers were picked

688
00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:26.571
to go this,

689
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:30.170
this kid had been in the army for a couple weeks and he had to go shoot a

690
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:34.800
deserter.
That was his one of his first assignments.
What the hell?
Yeah.

691
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:40.070
So there's some kind of a sum or some kind of Af I,

692
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:46.740
you know,
do we value human life more now?
That's the question.
I think the answer,

693
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.190
if you compare today compared to World War One,

694
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:54.960
the answer is 100% yes.
Without a doubt.
100% yes we do.

695
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.250
We do in the military would do and we do everywhere.
I think we absolutely do.

696
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.500
You got a nice long history of podcasts that are just sort of soul crushing.

697
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.520
You know,
we've hit some real home runs there with them to some podcasts.

698
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:12.690
You're like,
wow,
that is,
that is hard.
But you know what,

699
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:18.410
the reason that we hold human life in greater value now is because of that is

700
00:45:18.661 --> 00:45:22.350
because of those stories is because this letter,
I mean there's that,

701
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:27.300
that small piece of having to understand that we are here because of where we

702
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:30.360
came from.
We are here because of what we did and what we endured.

703
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.120
And that's not to say we won't go back to do that again.

704
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.410
That doesn't mean that we can't end up back in that place.
But those,

705
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.380
those stories that,
that legacy of that just

706
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.710
crazy impossible to understand how you can do that to that many people and just

707
00:45:48.111 --> 00:45:51.560
say,
that's just how we do business.
That's just what we do.
Um,

708
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:57.650
we have come a long way and I think we've moved in the right direction.
Now.

709
00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.590
There is a piece that

710
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:06.450
when people go to war,
people die.
Oh yeah.
You know,
that's,

711
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.730
and we,

712
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:13.850
we can't get to a place or to a point or to a belief in our society where that

713
00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:15.860
is not acceptable.
That it's,

714
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:20.640
that is not something we're willing to have happened or an order for us to be

715
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:21.091
successful.

716
00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:25.710
That that is not okay to get to point that any loss of life or any injury or any

717
00:46:25.711 --> 00:46:29.460
sacrifice is not okay.
We can't get to that point.

718
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:34.730
So overshooting that,
uh,
is not good either.
Um,

719
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:38.070
I wouldn't use world war one has a benchmark,
you know,
that's just,

720
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.710
it's not even close.
But the reality is,

721
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:45.510
is that that's not just how war is,
but that's actually necessary.

722
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:50.730
And that's,
uh,
as a leader,
that's a huge burden.
That's a huge burden.

723
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.760
And the burden is to balance the responsibility that you have to do everything

724
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.130
to ensure that doesn't happen to your people knowing full well knowing full well

725
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:07.890
that it will,
and I'll be really,
dude,

726
00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:12.690
I'll be really honest with you.
I did not,

727
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.760
when I went to Iraq,

728
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.720
I did not really grasp that it might happen to my guys.

729
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.110
I just didn't.
And,
um,

730
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.370
<v 1>I just</v>

731
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:35.370
<v 2>didn't give it enough thought that the risk was actually gonna end up with me</v>

732
00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.030
and my guys and that Chris was going to get killed.

733
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.910
And I looked back on that as a leader and I,

734
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.100
I should have thought about that more.

735
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.940
I should have prepared for that more and I should have known what that meant

736
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.530
more than I did.

737
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:56.400
And the reality is is that anybody in this business that goes to combat in any

738
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.770
shape or form has to be prepared for that and recognize it.

739
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.860
That is what happens in combat and that your job as a leader is to do everything

740
00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:12.460
you can to prevent it knowing full well that that is going to happen.

741
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:13.420
That's what happens.

742
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:17.530
How long did it take you once you were on the ground in Ramadi?
Not long so,

743
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:21.970
so the,
the sledgehammer for me,
sir,

744
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.090
I mean I will never forget the day.

745
00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.190
I'll never forget June 20th ever.

746
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.540
The sledgehammer for me was the first day I got there.

747
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:38.200
The guy that I was replacing got in a Humvee,

748
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.630
hit an ID.
Now he,
he,
he,

749
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:44.620
he was wounded but he broke both of his legs in a Humvee that I was supposed to

750
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:47.200
take from him.
We were supposed to do.
The turnover of that Humvee ended up,

751
00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:49.000
obviously not getting that vehicle because it got blown up,

752
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.600
but it was a major in the marine corps and it was like majors in a major aviator

753
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:57.400
in the Marine Corp blown up by an IED.

754
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:03.390
So I got up to speed very quickly and that place had an ability to get you to be

755
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:10.600
aware of the reality of it very fast.
So I think I got there very fast.
Day One,

756
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:14.230
something happened,
but the anticipation about getting there,

757
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.880
that was kind of a sledgehammer for me.

758
00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:20.440
What about reading reports when you were going in?
So

759
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:26.380
I,
I,
we talked about this last time.
My best friend was in Ramadi noodle.
Yeah,

760
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:28.600
Neil Neil was in Ramadi in third battalion,

761
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:30.880
second marines s so make no mistake Jocko.

762
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.960
I objectively understood what was going on.
I mean,
I was aware,

763
00:49:34.961 --> 00:49:38.170
I knew I was getting myself into when I asked to go on that fact tour to Ramadi.

764
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.280
But the disconnect was what it meant.

765
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.460
It's sorta like the same disconnect that we were talking about when you read

766
00:49:48.461 --> 00:49:52.420
these books.
Like you're reading reports but you're,
you're not there mentally.

767
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.493
Well look,

768
00:49:55.180 --> 00:50:00.180
combat for me was dropping a bomb in Iraq and Afghanistan was certainly more

769
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:04.210
aggressive experience for me even though it was a lot more regular pace.
Um,

770
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.940
there was certainly some risk involved.
Um,

771
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.770
but you've talked about the first combat experience on this podcast a lot.

772
00:50:11.771 --> 00:50:13.840
We've talked about just the first combat experience as well.

773
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.080
I did not really get it until I saw it.

774
00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.140
And actually in some ways you could say I didn't get it until I heard it.

775
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.420
You know,
the sounds of combat,

776
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:30.710
what it really sounds like to have a bullet go past your head so close to you

777
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:34.850
can actually sort of gauge how close it was to your head and whether it was

778
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:37.610
closer to the guy next to you three feet away or closer to you.

779
00:50:37.611 --> 00:50:40.550
Who was the sniper actually looking.
I've had those thoughts.
I know you have to.

780
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.620
So the sights,
the sounds of that.
Um,
it's just,

781
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.640
it's hard to replicate and I've actually been mds.

782
00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:52.490
You've talked about the training that you did for your guys at task unit bruiser

783
00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:55.730
and some of the things you did.
I didn't do a lot of those things.
You know,
and I,

784
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:57.860
and I showed up and like this is no criticism,

785
00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:01.850
I'm not throwing the hidden anybody.
This is just the way it was.
I got to that,

786
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.000
that,
that the unit that I deployed with a,
I showed up in October,

787
00:51:05.001 --> 00:51:06.540
I did some training.
Uh,

788
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:10.160
I kinda really joined the unit in earnest in like January and I was in Ramadi in

789
00:51:10.161 --> 00:51:11.600
February.
We kind of,

790
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:16.690
you sort of laugh to me last time I shot my rifle in training once I s I BZ owed

791
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.470
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Oriented my,
my sights on my rifle when I got to Ramadi,

792
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:25.820
you know,
and that,

793
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:28.970
that training range they had just on the outside and made sure my sites,

794
00:51:28.971 --> 00:51:31.760
we're in good shape before I went out on my first patrol the next day.

795
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.800
So in a lot of ways I was just Kinda in over my head with what that was.

796
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:40.910
And then on that deployment,
it just,
yeah,
it's crazy.

797
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:44.350
And it happens.
So there was,
you know,
that's the sort of,
uh,

798
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:49.400
the trial by fire story.
I mean,
that's what it was for me.
But I will say this,

799
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:54.620
um,
I got up to speed quickly in the re the recognition of the reality and look,

800
00:51:54.621 --> 00:51:56.570
people were,
we're getting wounded,

801
00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.960
people are getting killed pretty regularly that you can see.
I'm like,
man,
that's,

802
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.330
that's close to,
that's real.
That's on the street I've been on.

803
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:06.800
That's an a patrol I've done.
That's an,
an opiate I've manned.
So I,

804
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.380
I got to that point very quickly.

805
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.690
And the lessons that I had grown up with as a leader,

806
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:19.880
the way that I,
I was as a leader,
I was able to leverage that.
They,

807
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:25.130
they still worked leadership and combat.
It's,
it's certainly more dynamic.

808
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.780
It'll certainly strike more fear in you,
but the principles don't change.

809
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:35.030
And I was old enough and mature enough and I had enough under my belt to say,

810
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.800
okay,
I need to control this.

811
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.760
I need to control how I react in this setting and I need to do what I do and I

812
00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:42.470
need to do the things that I know what I need to do.
Uh,

813
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:46.310
and I was lucky enough to be able to do that and keep my,
you know,

814
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:48.140
my wherewithal and not get overwhelmed by it.

815
00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:50.750
And I saw guys get overwhelmed by it here and there and it was a place that that

816
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:55.400
could do that to you,
but I was able to fall back on
leadership principles,

817
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:56.263
how you lead a marine,

818
00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.050
<v 0>where you did you think mentally,
right?</v>

819
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:03.120
The mental game of being able to detach and be able to take a step back.

820
00:53:03.121 --> 00:53:06.600
And as a fighter pilot,
did you just say,
oh,

821
00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:10.620
this is what it's like as a fighter pilot.
This is what it's like.
Oh,

822
00:53:10.621 --> 00:53:12.510
I remembered.
It's like landing on an aircraft carrier.

823
00:53:12.511 --> 00:53:14.760
I'm going to be stressed out when it,
oh,
I need to overcome that.

824
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.880
Did you just apply the same mechanisms to,
all right,

825
00:53:17.881 --> 00:53:20.910
now I'm going to be stepping foot on the battlefield and this is how I need to

826
00:53:20.911 --> 00:53:23.130
apply this same mentality,
the same mechanisms.

827
00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:27.600
<v 2>I had enough experience of being and controlling the fear that comes along with</v>

828
00:53:27.601 --> 00:53:31.890
things that are scary,
that it looked different.

829
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.950
It smells different,
it sounded different,
but the feeling was exactly the same.

830
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:36.750
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

831
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.360
<v 0>So that's what I was like.
Like I said,
that's why it's a softball,
cause I'm,</v>

832
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.110
I'm imagining that,
you know,
even even for us,
okay,

833
00:53:43.111 --> 00:53:46.290
so let's say free fall,
like you're going to free fall.
Well,

834
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.470
you're jumping out of an airplane.
And I was,

835
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.530
I thought it would be more scared the first time I jumped out of an airplane,

836
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.680
but I was actually pretty pumped.
So that's not a great example.

837
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:59.760
But there's times in the seal teams where you do something in training where

838
00:53:59.761 --> 00:54:02.040
you're like,
okay,
this is a little bit sketch,
right?

839
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:06.960
This is a little bit sketch and you know,
what do you do?
You do the same thing,

840
00:54:06.961 --> 00:54:10.410
you know,
okay,
this is what I'm gonna do.
I've practiced it,
I've rehearsed it.

841
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.960
I'm going to,
I'm going to execute this thing and we're going to make it happen.

842
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.860
And you learn how to do that.
So when you get in combat,

843
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:20.660
you have a protocol to follow to take that street.

844
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:24.900
If you're good now,
you know,
we see keep people that they,
they,

845
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:29.160
they have the protocol and they aren't able to apply it to the situation.

846
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:33.150
<v 2>Yeah.
I,
I never really freaked out when I was there.</v>

847
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.190
The reality was,
oh,
this is a lot closer to me than I thought it was going to be.

848
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:42.840
The reality was hitting me harder than I expected in my preparation wasn't where

849
00:54:42.841 --> 00:54:44.880
it needed to be to be ready for it.
But when I got there,

850
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.450
I knew that feeling and I felt that several times in my career.

851
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.820
And their response to it is,
is it's all the same.

852
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:56.240
And one of the best things about responding to those situations is that as a

853
00:54:57.931 --> 00:55:02.520
leader,
you're really busy.
There's a lot to do.
You,
you've got a lot going on.

854
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:05.280
A lot of decision you have to make a lot of things you have to be aware of and

855
00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:09.000
that's actually one of the best remedies for all that and you know,

856
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:12.240
it's probably really tough for someone who really junior in the organization

857
00:55:12.241 --> 00:55:14.040
that may feel like he doesn't know what's going on,

858
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:17.980
doesn't have a real sense of those things.
I was never really bored,

859
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.670
you know what I mean?
Of Time.
They have a lot of time now I,
I,

860
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.660
I know the feeling I've had it.
I felt that feeling and I was like,
man,

861
00:55:24.661 --> 00:55:26.160
this is a lot different.
I'm in a Humvee,

862
00:55:26.161 --> 00:55:29.460
I can't see things I'm used to being able to see my situational awareness is

863
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:30.540
different.
How I gathered information,

864
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:32.670
all that is different because the environment's different,

865
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:35.100
the feeling of the same and the responses to the same.
And like I said,

866
00:55:35.101 --> 00:55:38.280
I had the luxury,
if you want to call it that.
I was always busy.

867
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.070
I was at stuff going on.
I had always things to do.
I never,

868
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.270
I didn't just sit there and think,
wow,

869
00:55:42.271 --> 00:55:44.640
this is terrifying and scary and I don't know what to do.
It's

870
00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:50.140
in the aftermath that look back.
Oh man,
that was,
that was crazy.
You know,

871
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:54.720
I remember I have this very vivid memory of,
of doing,
we call them,
um,

872
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.070
presence patrols.

873
00:55:56.430 --> 00:56:00.180
So we take a couple of Humvees and cruise around and in this case it was a,

874
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.570
the town,
it was called [inaudible].
It was a little town in,

875
00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:05.400
in Ramadi there on the south side and just a nasty place.

876
00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:08.700
Just not a good place and a presence,
patrols,
religious,

877
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.870
you're just waiting to get shot at.

878
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.570
And we would weave in and out of of the the streets and you know,

879
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:16.810
the buildings are two or three stories high and we pulled up to an intersection.

880
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:16.960
Were,

881
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.190
were the second vehicle in this two vehicle patrol and the vehicle turns into as

882
00:56:20.191 --> 00:56:23.990
soon as the vehicle in from it yet two vehicles.
Yeah.
Get some,
we're number two.

883
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:27.580
The first vehicle makes a right hand turn.
As soon as he turns.
Right.

884
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:30.540
Guy With an RPG,
I can see him up.
You know,

885
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:35.380
right at my 12 o'clock position and it goes over the hood of our vehicle,

886
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:37.870
hits the wall.
It doesn't detonate,

887
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:42.820
but I think I might've mentioned this before and I'm just yelling,
go,
go,
go,

888
00:56:42.821 --> 00:56:46.320
go,
go.
Uh,
and those are the stories that in the APP,

889
00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.090
when you look back in the afternoon,
I'm like,
man,
that was crazy.
But at the time,

890
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:51.680
you don't really spend a lot of time though.

891
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.120
You're saying you're going to go to the right,
hey,
and you're on the radio here.

892
00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:57.610
Where's the other vehicle?
Hey,
this is what,
just how you're,
you're talking,

893
00:56:57.611 --> 00:56:59.530
you're communicating,
you're doing all the things you're supposed to do.

894
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:01.150
So you can look back on those things.

895
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:03.400
And a lot of times I'll look back and I'm like,
man,
that was out of control.

896
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.910
That was nuts.
Or,
but during those times,
even some of those,

897
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:10.630
those terrifying experiences,
I was just too busy to really worry about it.

898
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:14.310
And I was making decisions.
And I think as a leader,
that's,

899
00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.850
that's actually good because I don't want to sit there and think about all these

900
00:57:18.851 --> 00:57:19.571
things that are scaring me.

901
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:22.800
I want to just respond to it and just make a decision and do something.
Um,

902
00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:25.600
and I actually had a lot of time in my career where I was,

903
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:28.690
I got very comfortable making decisions in difficult environments very quickly.

904
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:31.360
That's aviation in a nutshell.
Um,

905
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.720
and so I think I was able to adapt to that very quick and it's part of the

906
00:57:34.721 --> 00:57:37.510
reason why I was able to get through that,
that deployment the way that I did.

907
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.480
You know,
I had some decompression,
we talked about that after,
after the fact,

908
00:57:40.481 --> 00:57:42.400
but not a lot while I was there.

909
00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:47.200
<v 4>Did you ever punch out of your aircraft,
your rejects?
No.</v>

910
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.753
Is that just a lot?

911
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.140
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean some of it's beyond your control and it's pretty rare.</v>

912
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:56.040
It doesn't happen all that often,
but not me.

913
00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.533
Thank God.

914
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:03.130
<v 4>Check.
You know,
one of the things you were talking when you were talking about,</v>

915
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:04.250
you know,

916
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:09.070
will you basically went on a whole comment there about,

917
00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:11.440
you know,
you got to,
you're in a situation,

918
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.950
going back to the original subject here as a leader,

919
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:18.340
you're in this situation where you're going to take these guys that you care

920
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:21.700
about and you're going to do everything to protect and your,

921
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.660
regardless of how much you want to protect them there,

922
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.470
you're going to put them in situations where they can get killed and that that

923
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.510
the new book coming out.

924
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.490
The first chapter is called the ultimate dichotomy.
It's what it's called.

925
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:39.790
It's the ultimate dichotomy and there's a reason because that is the ultimate

926
00:58:39.791 --> 00:58:43.390
dichotomy.
There's know that for a leader as far as I'm concerned,

927
00:58:43.391 --> 00:58:46.180
if that is the absolute hardest thing that you have to deal with as a leader,

928
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.230
the fact that you care about these guys,
it's your all,
you've been taught,

929
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.350
all you believe,
all you've think all your,
your,

930
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:57.490
your morals and your values are all of these for these guys that are doing

931
00:58:57.491 --> 00:59:02.491
anything for you and you'll do anything for them and you know their families and

932
00:59:03.611 --> 00:59:06.400
you know they're kids and it's like,
yeah,
guess what,

933
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:12.240
take all that and now you're going to send them on missions where there is no

934
00:59:13.211 --> 00:59:16.390
doubt that they can get wounded or they can get killed.

935
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:22.400
You met Marcos at,
uh,
at the muster.
We talked about him earlier and

936
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:26.210
<v 2>this is a kid that would have done</v>

937
00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:32.020
anything for me to this day.
He would do anything for me.

938
00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:33.970
This is a kid that loves me.
I love this kid too.

939
00:59:33.971 --> 00:59:38.971
And that's that feeling that is very hard to explain if you haven't gone through

940
00:59:39.101 --> 00:59:39.280
it.

941
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:44.280
And it's very hard to describe how powerful that is at every single day.

942
00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:49.900
I threw Marcos and the Turd on my Humvee stuck his head up.
You know,

943
00:59:49.901 --> 00:59:51.670
it was an armored Humvee was great,
but at the end of the day,

944
00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:52.900
you know what the target it has to do.

945
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:57.370
He's got to get his head up out of the Turret and man that to 40 golf or 50 cow

946
00:59:57.371 --> 01:00:02.350
or whatever we had on that on any given day and stick his head out of that

947
01:00:02.351 --> 01:00:04.870
Humvee every single day.

948
01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.660
And I thought about that all the time,
all the time.

949
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:12.970
And it is exactly what you just described.

950
01:00:12.971 --> 01:00:15.850
This is someone that would have done anything for me.

951
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.430
This is someone that I loved and would have done anything for.

952
01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:22.210
And every day it was get in the turret and let's go.

953
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.010
That's what you do.

954
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.130
And you do everything you can to prepare them and everything you can to make

955
01:00:29.131 --> 01:00:31.860
sure it doesn't happen.
And the last thing you tell them is,
hey,

956
01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:36.420
get up there and we gotta go.
We gotta go do this.
No,
just can you even fathom,

957
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:40.360
can you even fathom that that happens?
And you do it from Monson,

958
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.920
you do it for months and you'd do it for a year.
And finally he says,

959
01:00:43.921 --> 01:00:47.280
you know what,
I can't do this anymore.
And then you said,
you know what?
Okay,

960
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.030
we're pressing charges against you.
You're going to court marshal,

961
01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:52.470
we find you guilty.

962
01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.310
<v 1>Okay,</v>

963
01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:57.000
<v 2>that's insane.
And to take it a step further,
organize,</v>

964
01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.130
get somebody else in my unit to pull the trigger.

965
01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.990
We're going to get another guy from this unit,
from this battalion,
this fund,

966
01:01:03.991 --> 01:01:08.320
this team to follow through with that,
that order.
It's,
it's not actually,
no,

967
01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:12.910
I can't comprehend that.
I can't understand that.
Um,
I can't,

968
01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.630
I can't either.
I mean,
um,
like I said,

969
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:20.920
I'm doing a podcast about it in the near future.
Yeah.
But for the love of God,

970
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:25.900
that's a trajectory.
It's,
it's,
thank God,
uh,

971
01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:28.480
being in this time period.
Yeah.

972
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.290
And we could talk about this stuff for days.

973
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.940
You've talked about it or would you just the last podcast with the imperial

974
01:01:36.941 --> 01:01:38.800
Japanese doing those experiments.

975
01:01:38.801 --> 01:01:43.750
We talked about the dehumanization and look,
obviously it's,

976
01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:47.980
it's grotesque,
but the dehumanization of your enemy.

977
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.370
I,
I understand how that happens.
I can,

978
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.320
I can understand that we don't get there.
Yeah,
I can.

979
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:58.130
I can see how people can get there.
Yeah,
I can see that.
And I know that,

980
01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.610
that I know the seeds of how that grows and I know that feeling I've had,

981
01:02:00.611 --> 01:02:02.170
that feeling grows over time of,

982
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:06.850
of that disdain and that dehumanization that I said I would never have happened

983
01:02:06.851 --> 01:02:09.080
to me.
And I fell.
And I know that feeling.
So I,

984
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.890
my point is that if you've ever heard me say with our enemy,

985
01:02:11.891 --> 01:02:15.370
we didn't really have to dehumanize them because they dehumanised themselves as

986
01:02:15.371 --> 01:02:20.170
we saw what they did.
I saw the acted and what they did to the civilian.
Totally.

987
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:23.970
It's absolutely you dehumanized yourselves and again,

988
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:26.250
you're going to suffer the consequences of that yet.

989
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.670
And so that's a bridge in my mind.
I can cross,
I understand that.

990
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:35.600
I don't understand how you can get to a point where the value of the human life

991
01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:41.421
of your own men is that you just discard them at the end.

992
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.940
Like,
Oh,
you're done.
Got It.
Lined them up.

993
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:50.930
And that to me is kind of horrifying because I had a small unit,

994
01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.140
I'm gonna have a big unit and I certainly knew my guys pretty well.

995
01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.900
And maybe when you have,
you know,

996
01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.610
a huge unit of a bunch of unnamed people you don't build strong relationships

997
01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.440
with,
but at the end of the day that are wearing your uniform,

998
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:05.340
at the end of the day there they look,
sound talk and are just like you.

999
01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:07.900
A lot of them come from the same place as you.
Um,

1000
01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:11.640
and that's really difficult to accept.

1001
01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:14.810
The human beings are capable of doing that.
Like I said,
when,

1002
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.660
when it's your enemy or,
or it's when it's someone that's different than you,

1003
01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:22.110
you at least can comprehend that.
And you've see,
we've seen that in history,

1004
01:03:22.111 --> 01:03:26.190
but you're your own guys.
Um,
that's,
that's a different level.

1005
01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:33.680
It's a different time period.
Yep.
So going back to,

1006
01:03:33.681 --> 01:03:36.260
or not going back to you,
but going forward,
right?

1007
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:38.630
You got out of the Marine Corps,

1008
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:41.720
I mean obviously we covered a little bit of this on the last podcast we covered

1009
01:03:41.721 --> 01:03:43.250
about,
you know,
what we did,

1010
01:03:43.251 --> 01:03:47.570
we kind of read the text last time you were on the podcast of kind of how the

1011
01:03:47.571 --> 01:03:49.640
transition,
you know,
you got out,

1012
01:03:49.641 --> 01:03:54.641
you came to an event with Leif and I and we hung out and you were sinking

1013
01:03:55.281 --> 01:03:58.520
yourself.
You have this looks like,
uh,
what I want to do.
Yeah.

1014
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.060
But there's been more to it than that

1015
01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.730
that you've kind of briefed me on a little bit
how much time we got.

1016
01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.650
Yeah,
there is,
there's a lot more to it.
Um,

1017
01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:20.700
the work that we do is awesome and I wrote you a letter a few,

1018
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.300
several months ago now,
but I wrote you a letter kind of in some ways,
you know,

1019
01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:27.810
somebody was like,
Hey,
thank you for bringing me part of this team.
And,

1020
01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.740
and there was,
you know,

1021
01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:33.010
I wanted to express some gratitude and I did that to everybody to have been

1022
01:04:33.011 --> 01:04:35.710
brought into something that is really incredible.
And,
and,
and,

1023
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.240
and I wanted that to be clear,

1024
01:04:37.241 --> 01:04:42.241
but I also wanted to kind of explain what I was going through,

1025
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.290
um,
is as part of the transition and

1026
01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.650
what has hit me the hardest is not the things that I expect it to happen that

1027
01:04:53.651 --> 01:04:56.590
have happened and look,
some really good things have happened.

1028
01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.960
This is an awesome company.
We do great things and I get there,

1029
01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:02.500
make an impact and I love being a part of this and I saw it.

1030
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.830
So I sort of expected to be able to do that and be a part of that and see the

1031
01:05:05.831 --> 01:05:08.130
impact of that.
Um,

1032
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.200
but I didn't give much thought at the time to how I was going to impact me and

1033
01:05:13.601 --> 01:05:18.000
what the impact of being a part of this would for,

1034
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.020
for my growth.
And for myself.

1035
01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:23.500
I think we just talked about this earlier today when

1036
01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:29.020
I get introduced to these events all the time and they read my bio sometimes and

1037
01:05:29.021 --> 01:05:33.130
I hear the words of what we're doing and everything and what I've done.
And,

1038
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:38.160
and I was at a point that I can look back and very easily think that I could

1039
01:05:39.011 --> 01:05:42.580
have coasted.
I could have said,
hey,
I,
I,

1040
01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:44.560
I did some good work in the Marine Corps.

1041
01:05:44.561 --> 01:05:47.800
I got a really cool resume and I've kind of got it figured out.

1042
01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:50.680
I don't have that much more to learn it.
I'm going to kind of,
I'm going to glide,

1043
01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:52.720
I'm going to kind of,
you just go straight level for a while.

1044
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:58.530
And the biggest part of this transition for me is the recognition

1045
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:05.230
that what I have done to this point,

1046
01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:08.770
what I accomplished as a marine and,
and the things that I did as a pilot,

1047
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.010
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

1048
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:20.680
Because if I cash in now and I check in the box and I'm done,
and I,

1049
01:06:20.681 --> 01:06:25.681
and I coast from now all define my life by having coasted for the rest of my

1050
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:28.324
life.

1051
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:33.870
And I wasn't really prepared for having to recognize of how much more there is

1052
01:06:35.171 --> 01:06:39.610
for me to learn and how much more there is for me to do.
Um,

1053
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:44.730
and that has been by far the best and the most humbling part about this.

1054
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:50.890
And you got,
you know,
me at this point,

1055
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.860
you know me well enough that I'm not afraid to admit,
you know,

1056
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:58.240
things that are kind of hard to admit.
I'm not afraid to kind of humble myself.

1057
01:06:58.241 --> 01:07:02.790
I'm not afraid to say,
wow,
I got that wrong.
I didn't see that coming.
Um,

1058
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:08.710
this transition has been way,
way more than I thought it was going to be.

1059
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.770
Uh,
and in some ways it's actually put me on my yields a little bit.

1060
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.940
It's been a reminder that
man,

1061
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.660
I'm not even close to have to doing the things that I want to do before I'm
done.

1062
01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:23.200
I'm not even close.
And it's,
that's a hard feeling sometimes.
It's actually,

1063
01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.040
I struggle with that a little bit,
um,

1064
01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:28.750
because a lot of the times people around me to tell it,

1065
01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.990
tell me I've done great things and I hear that a lot and it's great to hear,
but

1066
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.980
I'm not even close man.
And,
and,

1067
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:41.040
and that is something I struggle with every day and I work at every day and I

1068
01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:43.330
have a lot,
a lot,
a lot to do.

1069
01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.150
<v 0>I don't think that you,
you didn't get to where you were without feeling that,</v>

1070
01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:54.100
right?
Yeah.
You don't get to,
you don't get to be,
you know,
the,

1071
01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.730
all the things that you did in your big bio without saying,
without,

1072
01:07:58.731 --> 01:08:00.260
without having the back of your mind.
Like,

1073
01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:02.570
I needed to do more than I need to do better.
Right?

1074
01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.030
<v 2>Yeah,
that's true.
That is true.</v>

1075
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.070
But the magnitude of,
of it,

1076
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.770
it gets bigger over time.
It doesn't smaller.

1077
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:20.980
The magnitude continues to grow.
I know what this is.

1078
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:24.470
This is like when you started Jujitsu and you're like,
well,
you know what?

1079
01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:27.770
He'd give me a few weeks to figure this out.
Right.
And be like,

1080
01:08:27.771 --> 01:08:32.070
two or three months I'll probably be tapping this guy out.
Yeah.
And then no.
Oh,

1081
01:08:32.071 --> 01:08:36.710
two weeks into it,
you're going,
oh my God.
There's a whole nother thing here.

1082
01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:39.890
Yeah.
That might be one of the best metaphors for it.

1083
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.290
You know that that experience,
look,

1084
01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:47.291
the Jujitsu things started because on the podcast I was describing for the last

1085
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:50.900
podcast I was describing flying to you has described it was just shopping dog

1086
01:08:50.901 --> 01:08:53.560
fighting too.
Yeah.
And you're like,
dude,
that sounds exactly like Jujitsu.

1087
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:56.150
And that's kind of what sparked my interest was w is there a way to kind of

1088
01:08:56.151 --> 01:08:59.510
replicate those experiences that I had that I know I can't do it in an airplane

1089
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:02.060
anymore,
but can I,
can I replicate that in some other way?

1090
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.120
And that was what was intriguing to me.
Um,

1091
01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.710
and that was what got me on the path of that.
But look,
I already said this,

1092
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:14.510
I didn't think the magnitude of the panic of,
Oh God,
I'm running out of time.

1093
01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:17.360
I have so much more to do was going to get bigger over time.

1094
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:22.180
And that is sort of what like Jujitsu is,
is,
and,
and I,

1095
01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:26.240
again,
I think we've had this conversation,
well,

1096
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:30.240
I've made fun of you on this podcast when you weren't here.
Yeah.
Have you be,

1097
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:35.180
you know,
you sent me a tax like,
Bro,
this is horrible.

1098
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:37.220
Like,
oh,
well,
what's,
what's going on?
You're like,
well,

1099
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.830
I'm never going to be like really,
really,
really good at Jujitsu.

1100
01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:46.490
Like around your whatever.
You're 46 years old if you know.
Yeah,
get good.

1101
01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:51.180
You know,
get good.
It's all good.
Yeah,
no,
certainly.
Um,
I,

1102
01:09:51.181 --> 01:09:55.040
I think the messages and the lesson for me is,
is that a reminder of,

1103
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.090
of something that I did know,

1104
01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.570
something I have known throughout my life of that feeling of the clock is

1105
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:02.270
running.
You're on the clock right now.

1106
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.970
You don't know when that clock's going to end,
but I'm going to tell you,
Rau,

1107
01:10:04.971 --> 01:10:08.810
you're on it.
And every second that you're not grinding on that clock,

1108
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:11.180
you lose it.
And

1109
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:12.550
<v 1>okay,</v>

1110
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:16.420
<v 2>there's a point where complacency will try to sneak in.</v>

1111
01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:21.130
The complacency will try to crawl up and go,
Dude,
you've been crushing it.

1112
01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.900
Look at what you've done.

1113
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:27.550
And that voice can kind of get loud and they can kind of tell you like,
dude,

1114
01:10:27.551 --> 01:10:29.980
it's time to kind of turn the corner and coast a little bit,
Kinda,

1115
01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:33.160
Kinda glide just a little bit.
You're good.
Um,

1116
01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.100
and I think the best thing that's happened to me is that exposure to,

1117
01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:38.140
<v 1>okay,</v>

1118
01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.720
<v 2>echelon front exposure to it,
to,
to the,
to the team,</v>

1119
01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.860
and exposure to Jujitsu in a way of not like,
oh,

1120
01:10:44.861 --> 01:10:49.420
am I going to be some world champion and Jay,
it's that bro.
The more you know,

1121
01:10:49.421 --> 01:10:53.350
the more you learn,
the less you actually,
no,

1122
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:56.260
because learning just means like,
oh,
there's more out there.

1123
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:59.740
So you go from one to two,

1124
01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:04.150
but what's available is a hundred to a thousand and you get to three and a

1125
01:11:04.151 --> 01:11:07.330
thousand turns into 10,000 and Jujitsu is infinite.

1126
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.140
And so every time I get to whatever the next step is,
the next level,

1127
01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.830
all it really does is,
is this just somebody opening door go,
oh,

1128
01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:18.090
it's actually bigger.
So it's almost like you're getting worse.
You know,

1129
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:21.030
if you do the math,
I think I'm now at level four and above a million.

1130
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:26.110
You're like yesterday there was only four moves.
I didn't know.
Yeah,

1131
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.710
that's exactly right.
Today there's 40 moves they don't know.

1132
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.920
And the other thing is from,
from,
okay,

1133
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.350
for dog fighting in an aircraft,
right.

1134
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:40.170
It seems like there would be some limitation without a doubt.

1135
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.230
Okay.
And we haven't,
we,
you and I have not had this conversation,

1136
01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:45.630
but I've had those thoughts.
They're absolutely,
absolutely is a limit.

1137
01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:50.580
There's only so many things that you can do.
Um,

1138
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:55.120
and that's actually not true,
you know,
and,

1139
01:11:55.130 --> 01:12:00.000
and in an aircraft,
you know,
just,
just by constraints of time,
I mean,
you can't,

1140
01:12:00.001 --> 01:12:04.560
you can't go up and dog fight for four hours a day every now you do that in top

1141
01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:08.790
gun for,
for a few years.
But the opponents that you have,
well,

1142
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.030
I guess you're going to get to the other stuff,
but that's it.

1143
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.770
That's as good as you're gonna get.
Yeah.
But Jujitsu,

1144
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:16.290
you can do that for looking at here,
the parallels are undeniable.

1145
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.840
The parallels there,
and you saw that right away.
You and I talked about that.

1146
01:12:18.841 --> 01:12:22.710
There no question.
That has been the most intriguing thing for me is that it's,

1147
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:24.780
I'm able to replicate those feelings.

1148
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:30.170
But the unlimited nature of how of what's out there.

1149
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.240
If I had a guy in a hornet that I was going to go do BFM with and he was,

1150
01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:41.100
we were going to do these,
this maneuvers and he'd be like,
I like to do this.

1151
01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:44.430
When I'm defensive and it wasn't exactly what he's supposed to do,

1152
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.980
he was going to lose every single time.
I'm like,
Oh,
you,

1153
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:50.430
you're not going to do the best method in this situation.
Good.

1154
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:55.620
I'm going to savage you.
Jujitsu is not,
it's not like that.
Yeah.

1155
01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.760
If there is no,

1156
01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:01.850
this is what works and everything else is inferior and we have the geometry,

1157
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.160
we have the math,
we have the science,
the physics,

1158
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:08.800
and we actually at top gun through a ton of effort and try it on.

1159
01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.490
They're actually figured out this is what you need to do here.

1160
01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.840
This is how you create the most amount of closure.

1161
01:13:12.841 --> 01:13:15.030
These are all the things you do to maximize your aircraft,

1162
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:20.100
and so if somebody deviates from that,
it's just better for you.
That's not true.

1163
01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:20.973
Yes.

1164
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.670
It's been so broken down and so study that there's no possibility that someone

1165
01:13:26.671 --> 01:13:29.550
could come up with something and go,
oh,
I came up with something new.
No,

1166
01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:33.270
it's not happening.
Nope.
Not Happening.
And,
and when you're,
when you're,

1167
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:37.980
when you're a top gun,
I would love to somebody to try something new.

1168
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.690
Go for it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do,
do your worst.
Come up with your best game plan.

1169
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:46.860
Because I know what you need to do in this situation.
And if you don't do that,

1170
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.170
you're just giving me opportunity.
That's what you're doing.

1171
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.220
And so there is a level of that in Jujitsu where,
you know,

1172
01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:55.020
they're all going to put your arms up here,
there's all the,

1173
01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:57.450
you're going to give up your back and there's all these things that you can't
do.

1174
01:13:57.451 --> 01:14:00.360
But for instance,
Jeffy Glover,

1175
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:04.680
he'll give up his back and then he's rolling away from you or dean lister,
he's,

1176
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.720
you're getting him in a triangle,
you think,

1177
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:09.870
and then you're getting your guard passing or getting smashed.
So there's,

1178
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.980
there's times where the things

1179
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.180
<v 4>that you don't expect someone to do,
they do.
And it's problematic.</v>

1180
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.800
<v 2>Yeah.
And,
and I want to be very careful.
Um,</v>

1181
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.820
I'm so new at this that I almost should not be telling you what I think I know

1182
01:14:24.821 --> 01:14:25.654
about this,

1183
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:30.870
but the glide path to get from seeing the inside of an [inaudible] for the first

1184
01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:36.961
time in to being right at the very apex of that community,

1185
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.350
six,
seven years.
Oh really?
Yeah.
That's seven years from,

1186
01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.190
I'm going to introduce you to this airplane now and you know,

1187
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:47.891
you know how to fly,

1188
01:14:47.891 --> 01:14:51.100
but now I'm gonna introduce you to a combat aircraft for the first time in your

1189
01:14:51.101 --> 01:14:53.530
life,
a real combat machine.
You're going to get in that thing.

1190
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.460
I got there in 1998.
First Time I set foot in an team,

1191
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.710
I got to top gun in 2000,
uh,
uh,

1192
01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:05.620
2002 I left in 2005.

1193
01:15:05.621 --> 01:15:10.150
So I would say I was kind of at my apex in 2005.
So from 98 to oh five,

1194
01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:14.440
that's how long it took me to be at the top of,
of,
of that world.

1195
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:19.600
Am I going to be?
Can you imagine like the best guys

1196
01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.040
<v 4>Judici the guys that have been doing it for five to six years?
Well,</v>

1197
01:15:23.041 --> 01:15:25.650
what you have to do is you,
there are some anomalies out there.
Yeah.

1198
01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.200
There's guys that are incredibly,
the carnal natural hazards.

1199
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.030
And also you'd have to take someone and say,
okay,

1200
01:15:30.031 --> 01:15:33.720
this is your job because that was your job.
That's a big piece.
Hey,

1201
01:15:33.721 --> 01:15:36.870
this is your job.
And that happens.
Some kids get into Jujitsu and they're like,

1202
01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:38.430
oh,
I'm going to sleep on the mat.

1203
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.090
All I'm going to do is train Bj Penn and got his black belt and did well.

1204
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.830
Did he win the world's and after three years?
I don't think so.
But you know,

1205
01:15:46.831 --> 01:15:49.650
in three years got his black out and he was a legit blackbelt.

1206
01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.650
Someone was asking on social media the other day,
Hey,
is this guy legit?
He's,

1207
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.260
he seems to have calmed his black belt,

1208
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:59.250
got his black belt from dawn and her in a short period of time.
Oh,

1209
01:15:59.251 --> 01:16:03.270
you mean the judo?
A Olympian.
Olympic silver medalist.
Yeah.

1210
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:07.450
He might have some skills.
He might be able to get up there pretty quick.
Yes.
Uh,

1211
01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:10.860
for that answer.
Yes.
That dude is legit.
You can get your black belt,

1212
01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.560
you can get your back blackbelt pretty quickly.

1213
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:15.810
If you have a bunch of natural talent,

1214
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.390
maybe you have some kind of base wrestling,
judo,
something like that.

1215
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:21.240
And then you make it your job.
Yeah.
You can get your,

1216
01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.700
you can get really good really fast.
Yeah.
But yeah,

1217
01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:27.420
basically if your mind is like addicted to it in one way or another.

1218
01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:29.610
And then you have some prerequisites like you know,

1219
01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:33.750
the Geo and the,
yeah,
the Martinez brothers.

1220
01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:36.810
They had breakdancing that a lot of the same stuff,
you know,

1221
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:40.920
and that kind of went along with their style and I would go so far as to say

1222
01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:43.410
this is,
this is a guests.

1223
01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:49.380
I would go so far as to say that most people that have their black belt in

1224
01:16:49.381 --> 01:16:50.214
Jujitsu,

1225
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.860
we're in the obsessed mode at some point in their life.
Makes Sense.

1226
01:16:56.190 --> 01:17:00.580
That's what I'm going to say.
Sure.
I cannot disagree with that.
Right.
You,

1227
01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:04.380
have you ever known someone that's a black belt that that was not at least for a

1228
01:17:04.381 --> 01:17:07.800
period of three years was just,
that's all they thought about.

1229
01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.280
I don't know of any.
No,
they,
they were just into Jujitsu

1230
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:12.680
<v 2>real hardcore.
Yeah,
it's true.</v>

1231
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:17.720
And then maybe they grow out of a little bit or some,
whatever.
Some people lives,

1232
01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:22.550
keep training,
training hard.
That's how it is.

1233
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.320
One of the things that you did.
Uh,
and this is going,

1234
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.310
I hate to cycle back to the podcast again,
but I'm going to do it real quick.

1235
01:17:34.311 --> 01:17:34.910
So I had a,

1236
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:38.720
I had a note about it and it's something that you and I've talked about several

1237
01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:41.990
times from Tom five came on the podcast,
purple heart art,
you know,

1238
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:46.370
served in World War II,
Korea,
Vietnam,
purple heart,
World War II,
Korea,

1239
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:51.371
Vietnam Battalion Commander in world war or in Vietnam,

1240
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:57.280
a company commander in Korea and I think tank platoon commander,

1241
01:17:57.561 --> 01:17:59.960
a little road to tank platoon commander in World War Two.

1242
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:04.850
So if that's your resume,
what's our,
I'm sorry,
uh,
uh,
engineer and,

1243
01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:10.580
and so,
so there's his resume,
but it was really interesting.

1244
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:15.260
So when he came on the podcast and we were talking about,
you know,

1245
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:19.880
leadership and stuff like that and he gives this answer of,

1246
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:23.800
we were talking around the subject of,
you know,
how do you get someone out,

1247
01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.180
you know,
how do you get your people listen to you?
And he says,
Hey,

1248
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:27.320
you tell them to do it and they do it.

1249
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:31.250
And I remember you and I talking and afterwards he was like,
man,

1250
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:36.350
that was not a,
that was not a Jocko answer of like,

1251
01:18:36.351 --> 01:18:38.720
Hey,
you know,
hey listen,
you've got to build a relationship with people.

1252
01:18:38.721 --> 01:18:41.300
You've got to,
you got to get their trust,
you've got to earn their respect.

1253
01:18:41.301 --> 01:18:45.110
You got to,
you got to treat them how you want to be treated.
And then we,

1254
01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:48.860
if you explain to them why the mission is important and they believe in the

1255
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:51.650
mission and they know that you're going to back them up,

1256
01:18:51.651 --> 01:18:54.950
then they're going to back you up when you need dead to do something.
Like,

1257
01:18:54.951 --> 01:18:59.750
I have this whole thing,
right?
Yeah.
This is big problem.
It's this big,

1258
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:04.620
uh,
uh,
dance you got to go through as a leader.
And,

1259
01:19:04.621 --> 01:19:07.730
and I think to myself,
I've got this figured out.
And so he goes,
no,

1260
01:19:07.731 --> 01:19:11.840
I tell people to do it.
I'm like,
man,
that's Kinda,
that's kind of a bummer.

1261
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:15.740
I'm thinking,
what?
I'm gonna tell echo to edit that out.
Right.
Just kidding.

1262
01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.400
But then this was the cool part was then he,

1263
01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:24.640
he continued to talk about it and he gave just the most perfect answer.

1264
01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.890
The things that,
everything that we say all the time,

1265
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.520
everything that we talk about national on front,

1266
01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:34.340
everything that I talk about them,
those podcasts,
he gave it all.
Yeah.
He,
he,

1267
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:37.100
he really just did it in reverse order of conversations that we have.

1268
01:19:37.101 --> 01:19:40.730
We explained sometimes that in in really challenging environments,

1269
01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.470
sometimes you've got to say,
Hey,

1270
01:19:42.471 --> 01:19:46.010
go make this happen and you got to have your people say Roger that and they go

1271
01:19:46.011 --> 01:19:48.650
make it happen.
You gotta be able to do that sometimes.

1272
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:52.610
But the only way for that to work in those really demanding difficult,

1273
01:19:52.611 --> 01:19:57.611
challenging environments is to go way back before and build all those

1274
01:19:58.041 --> 01:20:00.380
relationships and create all that trust and do all those things.

1275
01:20:00.381 --> 01:20:02.850
So when people go,
Dave just said,
go make this happen.

1276
01:20:02.851 --> 01:20:04.760
When you don't make it happen,
we'll ask questions later.

1277
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.330
He just went to that part because I almost set it up for that because the

1278
01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:10.590
question I was asking him was,

1279
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:15.300
how do you get a guy to jump out of your tank under fire to fix the turn?

1280
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:18.570
In his mind,
that's the like there's rounds hitting the tank,

1281
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:22.390
Ping,
Ping,
Ping,
Ping,
Ping,
and the,

1282
01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:26.100
the tank track falls off and someone's got to get out there and fix it.

1283
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.070
And he goes to the junior guy and he's like,
you gotta get out there and fix it.

1284
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:33.480
And so it was,
he just did that whole thing in reverse order.

1285
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:36.530
He went to that part and then,
and I remember thinking like,
man,

1286
01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:40.080
that was kind of a bummer answer.
It really wasn't expecting that.
And I was like,

1287
01:20:40.081 --> 01:20:44.740
you just tell him what to do.
And then I didn't that work for me.
Yeah.
Uh,

1288
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:46.050
I might have to change the way.
Yeah.

1289
01:20:46.051 --> 01:20:50.880
So when he started to go and I remember that feeling of like,
oh he,

1290
01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:54.150
and now he's starting to explain it and I looked at you a couple of times and he

1291
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:57.360
did the whole thing and he,
he,
he,

1292
01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:02.100
he speaks very plain language too.
And he just sort of distilled it all down.

1293
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:05.550
It was like,
you have to take care of your people,

1294
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:10.290
you have to treat your people well.
And if you do,
they will do the same for you.

1295
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:15.240
And if you don't guess what,
when you say jump out of the tank under fire,

1296
01:21:15.241 --> 01:21:16.800
they're going to say no.

1297
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:19.830
That was the best part is when he actually came all the way back around and
said,

1298
01:21:19.831 --> 01:21:22.830
if you just think you're just going to tell someone to get out of a tank or a

1299
01:21:22.831 --> 01:21:25.500
fire and they don't believe in what's going on and they don't trust you and you

1300
01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:28.020
haven't taken care of them,
they're not going anywhere.

1301
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.790
Every time I hear all the people you've had on the podcast,

1302
01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:39.210
I know the stories are different,
but they're all saying the same thing.

1303
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.450
They're all saying the same thing and their own little nuance way,

1304
01:21:42.451 --> 01:21:44.730
their own little experience,
but it's always the same thing.

1305
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:48.210
And that was of all of them my favorite because I got to know Tom before the

1306
01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:50.800
podcast and we got to talk quite a bit.
Uh,

1307
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.690
and I got to spend time with them before we went live on that recording.

1308
01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.270
Um,
so I enjoyed that one the most,
but it's everybody's saying the same thing.

1309
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:04.590
Move made a huge point about that without caring about your people,

1310
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:08.010
you got to care about your people.
Again,

1311
01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:10.830
these are guys that were due that were leading

1312
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:13.610
draftees.
Yeah.

1313
01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:17.130
Vietnam draft these and I went off of this and then we were the other day.

1314
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:21.990
Is there any more hostile workforce in the,
okay,

1315
01:22:21.991 --> 01:22:25.320
maybe not my history of the world,
but is there,
this is right up there.

1316
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:27.360
You got guys that have been,
cause it's,
you know,

1317
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:29.910
if you're a World War II and you get drafted,
guess what?

1318
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:33.270
The country's behind the war.
You're going to be a hero.

1319
01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.110
You're fighting against Nazis or Jay imperial,

1320
01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:42.111
Japanese that are evil humans and you're on board for the big win.

1321
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:46.620
We get that.
That's what happens.
Korea like not quite so clear,
but guess what?

1322
01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:49.110
We still even remember World War II.
So guess what?

1323
01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:51.210
We're going to go get in the game.
Yeah.
Vietnam,

1324
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.300
they straight up don't believe in the war.

1325
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:57.330
They just straight up don't believe in the war there,

1326
01:22:57.331 --> 01:23:01.200
there against their will under threat of prison.

1327
01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.050
They show up there and these are the people you're in charge of.

1328
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:05.980
And this is the answer I give all the time now

1329
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.890
<v 0>for when people ask me about millennials,
people are like,
oh,
you know,
we,</v>

1330
01:23:08.891 --> 01:23:13.510
we got millennials and they got a bad attitude.
Oh really?
Oh really?

1331
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.640
That the millennials have a bad attitude.

1332
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:20.760
Compare that to a drafted Vietnam soldier,

1333
01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:25.600
and here's the thing that I realized because,
and when I pulled that,

1334
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.170
when I started going through hack again,
uh,

1335
01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.820
about face get and I started reading that,

1336
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:34.810
I realized that you got to change your perspective as a leader.
It's not just,

1337
01:23:34.811 --> 01:23:38.290
it's not just,
hey,
because we simplified it.
I like,
well,

1338
01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:41.110
if you're millennials aren't doing what you want,
it's your fault.
That's,

1339
01:23:41.111 --> 01:23:45.370
that's a simplification of it because what you really got to do is you got to

1340
01:23:45.371 --> 01:23:49.150
shift your mindset a little bit and say like,
what?
Wait a second.

1341
01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.930
How do I take advantage of,
that's what Hackworth was doing.
Hackworth was saying,

1342
01:23:52.931 --> 01:23:55.660
wait a second.
How do I take advantage of these guys?
Guess what?

1343
01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:58.420
They're going to question me if I do something wrong.

1344
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.910
They're going to report things that aren't done correctly.

1345
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.230
They're going to say no.
If I plan something stupid,
is that a bad thing?

1346
01:24:05.231 --> 01:24:08.380
Let me think about it.
Actually,
no,
that's actually not a bad thing.

1347
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.020
So if you've got a millennial that's like,
hey,

1348
01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:15.430
if I don't like the leadership here,
I'm leaving the company.
Guess what?

1349
01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.380
Let's get that person some good leadership.

1350
01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.390
And you've got to a millennial that says,
hey,

1351
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:22.320
if I don't understand why we're doing what we're doing,
I don't know.

1352
01:24:22.321 --> 01:24:25.360
I don't care.
I'm not going to do it.
Okay,
well let's explain to that person.

1353
01:24:25.361 --> 01:24:28.090
Why should they have a full understanding of what it is we're trying to get
done?

1354
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:33.010
You shift your mindset a little bit about the whole deal and you ended up in a

1355
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:36.910
much better position,
but it's a perspective shift.
Yeah,
you,
it's the same thing.

1356
01:24:36.911 --> 01:24:41.110
We always say it's not just take ownership of it.
So it's,
if you,
if you say,

1357
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:44.140
oh my millennials aren't doing what I need him to do,
that's my fault.

1358
01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.350
That doesn't make them to start doing what you need them to do.

1359
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:52.450
You actually have to make changes in your leadership style to adapt to this

1360
01:24:52.451 --> 01:24:56.800
attitude that's coming your way.
And at the end of the day,
if you do that,

1361
01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.130
you'll have someone that's smart,
that's motivated,

1362
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:04.300
that will get on board with the program and we'll do a great job.
Yeah,

1363
01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:08.100
just like drafting like a draftee.
And when,

1364
01:25:08.190 --> 01:25:12.160
when we see it in,
in leaders all the time,
they present it like

1365
01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:17.740
we can't leave these people,
these,
these unsolvable problem.

1366
01:25:17.741 --> 01:25:22.630
It is a problem and we're,
we're going downhill at supersonic speeds.

1367
01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.290
And when you do what you just said in trying to change that perspective and then

1368
01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:29.380
put it in comparison to the story of the draftees,

1369
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:33.700
they're almost a little embarrassed.
Like No.
Yeah,
yeah.

1370
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:36.610
That's one of those answers.
When I give that answer,
I,
I,

1371
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:42.250
I have to soften it a little bit cause I just can't
like,
hey,

1372
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:47.170
these guys were taking,
I don't,
I don't throw this in their face of like,
hey,

1373
01:25:47.171 --> 01:25:51.910
these guys were taking draftees that didn't even believe in the war and we're

1374
01:25:51.911 --> 01:25:55.510
going to get killed.
You're like,
hey,
you're asking someone to stay late.

1375
01:25:55.511 --> 01:25:58.110
And the Tuesday night.
Yeah.
That's what you're asking for.

1376
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:03.010
They were asking them to patrol through a mine written jungle.
Right.

1377
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:04.040
Not to mention

1378
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.860
<v 2>this person is actually interviewed or your company applied for a job,</v>

1379
01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.540
wants to be there.
Yeah.

1380
01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.330
There there's a clear difference in generations is something to think about,

1381
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:16.690
but nobody force this person to join your dean under threat and under threat of

1382
01:26:16.821 --> 01:26:21.710
prison.
Yeah.
And you see that in the,
when the recognition hits,

1383
01:26:21.711 --> 01:26:25.760
you can see it of like,
oh yeah,
no,
you're right.

1384
01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:30.660
This actually is a very solvable problem.
It just takes some work on my part.
Um,

1385
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:33.500
and I mean that's true with everything.

1386
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.500
<v 4>Yeah.
We got,</v>

1387
01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:37.560
I mean we obviously we have all kinds of companies out there that we work with

1388
01:26:37.561 --> 01:26:42.561
now and their workforce is now becoming all millennials and their front line

1389
01:26:43.321 --> 01:26:46.950
people right now at a company,
the frontline people are all millennials.

1390
01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:52.320
And so if you don't figure this out,
who,
who are you going to hire?
Yeah.

1391
01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.540
Who are you going to hire?
I mean,
it's like being in Vietnam.
You,

1392
01:26:54.570 --> 01:26:56.580
you were going to have draftees.
If you don't figure that out.

1393
01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:02.180
And that's the other thing is you hear the bad leaders from Vietnam that will,

1394
01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:05.510
that will say,
oh the draftees were horrible.
I couldn't work with them.
They were,

1395
01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:07.110
you know,
they didn't do want to do their job.

1396
01:27:07.111 --> 01:27:09.270
Stickman maybe you should look in the mirror a little bit.

1397
01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.100
<v 2>Yeah.
And that the,
the,</v>

1398
01:27:12.330 --> 01:27:17.170
the best part about that is when you asked,
same thing with Tom Fife.
Yup.

1399
01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.600
Cause he's like,
that's all.
That's all we ever had.

1400
01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.110
He was almost like they understand the questions.

1401
01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:25.570
That was our military back then when I was in,
when he was in the army.

1402
01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:30.640
It was like I didn't,
I couldn't tell you who was a draftee and who wasn't.

1403
01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:34.150
I didn't,
I didn't know the difference that I,
there are people,

1404
01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.260
they're human beings and I treated them like that.
And so the,
the,

1405
01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:42.800
just the idea that you would segregate those two,
the draftees and the,
and,

1406
01:27:42.801 --> 01:27:43.301
and the,

1407
01:27:43.301 --> 01:27:47.200
the volunteer military was immediate indication of what kind of leader you had.

1408
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:50.500
And these guys were like,
I don't,
first of all to understand the question,

1409
01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:52.650
all we had was draftees at the time we,

1410
01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.680
everybody was being drafted in the second,
didn't matter to me.
They didn't care.

1411
01:27:56.681 --> 01:27:59.140
I didn't care.
We had a mission to do.

1412
01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.030
I expand on the impact and the importance of the mission.

1413
01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:03.580
Told them their role in that mission and what would happen if they did or didn't

1414
01:28:03.581 --> 01:28:04.150
do it.

1415
01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:08.590
I cared about them and we just did it and that's my favorite part about Tom five

1416
01:28:08.591 --> 01:28:11.290
is he's,
he's just a plain spoken guy.
He doesn't have this really flowery,

1417
01:28:11.291 --> 01:28:13.600
articulate language.
He's just like,
oh yeah,
no,

1418
01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:16.070
I treated my people really well and when I asked them to do stuff,
they did it.

1419
01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.890
That's kind of,
that's kind of it.
That's a pretty awesome leadership advice.

1420
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.150
It is to your people really well and when the time comes that you need to do

1421
01:28:25.151 --> 01:28:27.990
something that they need to do something for you,
they're going to do,

1422
01:28:27.991 --> 01:28:28.690
I'm going to do it.

1423
01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:31.060
Take care of your people and your people are going to take care of you.
Yeah.

1424
01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.390
We started about a year to hear your dear,
thanks.

1425
01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:36.910
Take care of your people.
How about,

1426
01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:39.370
how about we start with that one and then your people are going to take care of

1427
01:28:39.371 --> 01:28:44.170
you too.
Yeah.
We,
I think we,
we forget those lessons sometimes.

1428
01:28:44.171 --> 01:28:47.620
You know,
it's human capital.
It's like,
no,
they're,
they're people.

1429
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:48.783
They're just people.

1430
01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:52.450
It's does treat them like people treat them like you treat anybody else.

1431
01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:56.380
And you know,
some of those fundamental lessons,
you know,
across leadership.

1432
01:28:57.190 --> 01:28:59.300
I think in a lot of ways I was lucky to,
to,
to,

1433
01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.530
to see that modeled early my career.
Uh,

1434
01:29:02.531 --> 01:29:04.490
and I think a lot of times we end up on the path of,

1435
01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.740
of who we're following on day one and they can take you down the wrong road if

1436
01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:09.470
you've got the wrong people.
Um,

1437
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:13.230
but when you see it in other people and they treat you that way and that feeling

1438
01:29:13.231 --> 01:29:16.590
of,
Oh,
this guy,
this guy really cares about me.

1439
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:21.270
This guy really is invested in me being successful in me having a good,

1440
01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:25.560
good life and a good career.
It's,
it's not hard to recognize like,

1441
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:29.550
oh that that's how,
that's what I should do.
And the exact opposite is true.

1442
01:29:29.551 --> 01:29:31.620
And like when the people,

1443
01:29:31.621 --> 01:29:35.830
and I worked for people that I despised and I despise because that,

1444
01:29:35.831 --> 01:29:36.571
how they treated me,

1445
01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:41.130
how they treated other people and just very evident like don't be like that.

1446
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.520
It doesn't work.
I'll,

1447
01:29:42.521 --> 01:29:46.200
I'll be in a group of leaders we're doing to working with the company.

1448
01:29:46.410 --> 01:29:50.280
I've done this many times where I'll set it up with,
hey,

1449
01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:53.880
who here has had someone in your life as that would,
that,

1450
01:29:53.881 --> 01:29:57.390
that was in charge of you that invested in you and took care of you?

1451
01:29:57.391 --> 01:30:00.390
Raise your hand.
And everyone raises their hand and,

1452
01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:04.140
or 99% of the people will raise their hand if not 100% of people raise your
hand.

1453
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.160
Cause that's,
you know,

1454
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:08.190
usually we're talking to leaders in the company and so the leaders have made

1455
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:13.310
progress somehow and they've made progress because someone at some point taught

1456
01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:17.760
them and took them under their wing and cared about them.
And you know,
so I say,

1457
01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:17.971
who,

1458
01:30:17.971 --> 01:30:21.300
who's had someone that cared about them and invested in them and took care of

1459
01:30:21.301 --> 01:30:25.080
them,
took care of you and everyone raises their hand and how did that feel?

1460
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.850
And everyone says,
oh,
I had it felt awesome,

1461
01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:29.010
but what would you do for that leader?
I do anything for him.

1462
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.600
Why don't you be that leader?

1463
01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:33.720
Then why don't you be that leader and take care of those people properly?

1464
01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:35.970
And you'll end up with a team.
They'll do anything for you,

1465
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.680
not for selfish reasons,
cause they'll see right through that.

1466
01:30:41.230 --> 01:30:45.930
You've got to be doing it for the team when you want the team to do well,

1467
01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:49.470
then they'll do anything for you.
Yeah,

1468
01:30:49.471 --> 01:30:53.330
I think that's a really important lesson for any leader out there for,

1469
01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:58.360
for leadership in general is how obvious what you're doing is to other people

1470
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.990
and whatever thing you're trying to hide or whatever the thing you're trying to

1471
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:07.860
cover up or,
or,
or something you're trying to mask,
he sees,
everybody sees it,

1472
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:13.290
everybody sees right through it.
And you know,
we asked the same question is,
okay,

1473
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:16.710
what would you want your subordinates to do to you?
Come up and say,

1474
01:31:16.711 --> 01:31:20.520
it's not my fault.
I didn't have anything and this isn't,
this isn't my fault.

1475
01:31:20.521 --> 01:31:22.200
I couldn't do anything about it.
You didn't send me up to win.

1476
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.010
Or would you like someone to walk them and say,
Hey boss,
I screwed this up.

1477
01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.360
There's a couple of things I could have done differently.

1478
01:31:27.361 --> 01:31:29.220
Here's what I learned and you know what,

1479
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.280
I'm going to do this next time and I'm gonna get this right and I'm going to fix

1480
01:31:32.281 --> 01:31:33.660
this.
And you say,
he said those two.

1481
01:31:33.661 --> 01:31:35.650
So really obvious to different scenarios and ask him,

1482
01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:37.850
what would you like to have from your subordinates?
Uh,

1483
01:31:37.851 --> 01:31:40.890
100% of the people are going to go,
I want the guy that comes in and says,
Hey,

1484
01:31:40.891 --> 01:31:42.900
it's my fault.
I'm going to fix her zone.
It's super obvious.

1485
01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:48.450
And then the very next question is,
why aren't you doing that with your boss?

1486
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:51.840
Why do you not think that your boss has having this same feeling as you would

1487
01:31:51.841 --> 01:31:52.860
have your subordinates?

1488
01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:58.250
And that recognition of everybody sees exactly what you're doing that's

1489
01:31:59.411 --> 01:32:03.430
uncomfortable for people.
Yeah.
The uncomfortable part is it's hard for people,

1490
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:06.760
I guess.
I guess we think that if you're my boss,

1491
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:08.920
I think you're not as smart as me and I think,
well,

1492
01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:11.620
he's just going to blame me when I come in and say it's my fault.

1493
01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:15.850
You're going to go,
yeah,
I know.
That's why I'm firing.
You know what I mean?

1494
01:32:15.851 --> 01:32:20.200
It's like,
no,
people are smarter than that and no one wants to hear excuses.

1495
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:22.950
No one wants to hear excuses.
Yeah.
You know what?

1496
01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:26.800
Sometimes people screw things up so bad that they're going to get fired.

1497
01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:30.520
I was just going to say that like,
and guess what?
If you go to make excuses,

1498
01:32:30.521 --> 01:32:32.600
guess what?
You're still only going to get fired.

1499
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:37.300
You're going to take what ever limited chance of maybe salvaging that at the

1500
01:32:37.301 --> 01:32:40.960
last second of like,
Hey boss,
hang on,
let me just,

1501
01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:46.330
if you do that,
you're just guaranteeing the outcome.
Lafe talks about that.

1502
01:32:46.331 --> 01:32:49.000
When he was the Xo at,
at,
uh,

1503
01:32:49.001 --> 01:32:53.260
seal team and he says,
you know,
he'd get a guy that was,

1504
01:32:53.261 --> 01:32:55.960
something was going wrong and a platoon and a guy would come in and say,

1505
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:57.250
you know,
it's not my fault,

1506
01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:01.120
my chiefs no good or my Lpo doesn't know what he's doing.
It like,
okay,

1507
01:33:01.121 --> 01:33:03.070
you're fired.
And the next part comes in and says,
Hey,

1508
01:33:03.071 --> 01:33:05.380
I'm not doing a good job as a leader.
Here's the things I'm going to change.
Like,

1509
01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:08.830
okay,
yeah,
we'll keep working on it.
Let me know if you have any questions,

1510
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:11.370
let me know if I can help you out.
Let's get you the support you need.
Yeah,

1511
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:15.700
that's,
that's a number.
That's extreme ownership.
Da.
Yeah,
sorry.

1512
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:20.770
W we would,
we would have bored sometimes for,
for pilots,
you know,

1513
01:33:20.771 --> 01:33:21.770
performance boards and,

1514
01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:25.650
and we would review a lot of material and a lot of times you'd,

1515
01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:30.070
you'd have to fire somebody.
I mean,
don't like doing it,
but in aviation you just,

1516
01:33:30.130 --> 01:33:32.180
it's a lot of times it's their whole,
it's the dream week.

1517
01:33:32.181 --> 01:33:32.900
Same thing with the teams.

1518
01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:37.120
Like they dreamed about this as a kid and you know that you are ending their

1519
01:33:37.121 --> 01:33:40.030
life's dream,
dream crusher,
dream crusher,
you're going to,

1520
01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.660
you're going to do that.
Not to mention a paycheck gone.
Yeah.

1521
01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:47.380
Well like for officers in the seal teams a lot of times is or retirement or

1522
01:33:47.381 --> 01:33:51.280
whatever.
It's it's a bad situation.
Yeah,
it's,
it's massive impact.

1523
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:55.540
It's a huge deal to do that and you take that very seriously.

1524
01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:56.970
When you're in a position where you are going to,

1525
01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.070
you're going to be one of the deciding factors in whether that person stays or

1526
01:34:00.071 --> 01:34:05.020
goes.
Anytime you get to that point where your mind like,
Hey,

1527
01:34:05.021 --> 01:34:08.320
the best thing is to get rid of this guy and if you bring them in for this or

1528
01:34:08.321 --> 01:34:12.940
that final interview,
that final interaction,
the guarantee way to seal your fate,

1529
01:34:12.970 --> 01:34:16.420
the guarantee way to ensure what they've already kind of concluded because

1530
01:34:16.421 --> 01:34:20.020
that's why they're bringing in in the first place is to not take any

1531
01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:23.530
responsibility to not take any donors.
That is 100% guaranteed.
Now,

1532
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.920
it doesn't mean that you might just not be able to,

1533
01:34:26.921 --> 01:34:28.690
you might not have the technical skills and the capability.

1534
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:32.680
Sometimes you're going to get fired and sometimes your mistake is so egregious

1535
01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:36.250
and does so much damage.
Yeah,
you gotta go,
you're going to get fired,

1536
01:34:36.251 --> 01:34:39.720
you're going to get fired,
but even then,
the,

1537
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:41.560
the best thing you can do,

1538
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:45.820
the best thing you can do is to take ownership of all that and be like,
Hey,
boss,

1539
01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:48.220
I understand.
I'm sorry.

1540
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:53.740
Or you can go the other route and you could start to throw everybody under the

1541
01:34:53.741 --> 01:34:57.590
bus.
And you know what?
This is what's interesting.
There are some people,

1542
01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.370
and I've talked

1543
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:01.160
<v 0>to many of them over the years,
many of them,</v>

1544
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:05.270
they don't make that connection.

1545
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:10.330
They literally don't make that connection.
They don't make the connection.

1546
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:15.410
They're looking at their boss and they're saying,
hey,
this wasn't my fault.

1547
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:19.910
It was my,
whoever it was my subordinate leader.
It was the maintenance guy.

1548
01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.050
It was this,
it was that.

1549
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:26.320
They literally don't make the connection that if you're in charge of something

1550
01:35:26.481 --> 01:35:28.880
or the,
you're responsible for something and it goes wrong,

1551
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:33.320
you're responsible for it.
Yeah.
And they cannot make that connection.

1552
01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:35.980
You feel like you're,
you just,

1553
01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:39.980
I would watch when we would have a bad seal platoon going through my training,

1554
01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.840
and I'd bring in a,
uh,
uh,

1555
01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:46.820
a platoon commander or a platoon chief and they would literally like,

1556
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:50.180
like an assault chief.
So the guy is in charge of the assault,

1557
01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:54.830
he's in charge of the assault,
and it's like,
hey,

1558
01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:58.220
all your men went to the wrong target.

1559
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:04.910
What happened?
Well,
it was briefed wrong.
Well,
it was this,

1560
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:08.570
well,
we marked the target wasn't marked correctly.
The battle maps.
I mean,

1561
01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:12.040
literally just,
you could come up with 20 excuses and you know what?

1562
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:14.150
They're all bell makes sense.
They're like,
hey,

1563
01:36:14.151 --> 01:36:17.900
someone made someone put the wrong number on the brief and everyone heard the

1564
01:36:17.901 --> 01:36:20.270
wrong number.
And they looked at their battle map and they went to that building.

1565
01:36:20.271 --> 01:36:22.370
Okay.
That's what happened.
Whose fault is it?

1566
01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.650
It's not the guy that made the battle map.
You're in charge.

1567
01:36:24.710 --> 01:36:28.370
You're in charge of the assault team,
you're in charge of the assault team.

1568
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:32.570
This is,
this is your fault.
And it would,

1569
01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.970
I would sometimes I would just,
actually,

1570
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.740
I would hardly ever say this was your fault.
I would milk.

1571
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:44.210
I wouldn't try and milk it out of them.
I would be like,
so we'll,
we'll,
I mean,

1572
01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.800
but still like who was in charge of the assaults?

1573
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.350
If only we had a guy in charge of that process and they say,
well,

1574
01:36:48.351 --> 01:36:50.150
you know what I mean?
Either you see a soul chief,
you know,

1575
01:36:50.151 --> 01:36:53.870
you can't expect to do the guided to be confirming that every single guy knows

1576
01:36:53.871 --> 01:36:58.790
where the target is revealing.
Okay.
Okay.

1577
01:36:58.791 --> 01:37:02.180
So you're not responsible for getting the men to the target as the,

1578
01:37:02.181 --> 01:37:05.570
you're not responsible for the assault as the assault chief is what I'm hearing.

1579
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:10.990
So it's really horrible when you see that someone can't make the connection.

1580
01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.570
And what this is,
this is another cool thing on social media.
I see this a lot.

1581
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:20.110
Guys will hit me up,
girls will hit me up.
Uh,

1582
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:25.040
something went wrong with a client I stepped in.
I took ownership,

1583
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:29.040
they thanked me,
problem solved,
got it squared away.
I can't,

1584
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.200
people are surprised.
People are surprised that it works.

1585
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:37.280
People are surprised that it works.
And again,
just to make sure everybody knows

1586
01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.610
that that alone doesn't work,

1587
01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.310
you still have to problem solve the problem with you because with the client,

1588
01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:44.430
right?
Right you,
you,

1589
01:37:44.431 --> 01:37:47.640
you gave them what they needed late or it's going to be late and now you say

1590
01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:48.503
it's my fault.

1591
01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:51.800
That doesn't mean that you don't need to get it to him asap and make up some

1592
01:37:51.801 --> 01:37:54.470
corrective measures and lower the price to do something so that it makes up for

1593
01:37:54.471 --> 01:37:55.980
the problem.
But the worst thing

1594
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.521
<v 2>you can say is,
well,</v>

1595
01:37:56.521 --> 01:37:59.430
you didn't specify exactly what you wanted it in the order and therefore we

1596
01:37:59.431 --> 01:38:01.680
couldn't get you what you wanted on time.
Okay,

1597
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:04.710
we're never coming back for business again and we're angry this whole time and

1598
01:38:04.711 --> 01:38:08.670
I'm going to short you money when we pay you in any ways.
A five.
Yeah,

1599
01:38:08.671 --> 01:38:12.660
let's make it,
let's make it the customers and the clients fault.
Let's do that.

1600
01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.010
And it gets back to something you said earlier about the conversation about the

1601
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:21.720
millennials is just for a minute detached to take a step back real quick and

1602
01:38:21.721 --> 01:38:25.890
just put yourself in their position.
What do they want to hear?

1603
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:31.140
What do they want to hear?
This client that things went sideways,

1604
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:33.750
that what they needed from you didn't happen.

1605
01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:35.340
They didn't get it delivered on time.

1606
01:38:35.341 --> 01:38:37.320
It didn't work the way it's supposed to work.
Or worse.

1607
01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:40.410
You gave it to something and it created a problem for their customers down the

1608
01:38:40.411 --> 01:38:44.460
line.
What do they want to hear from you right now?

1609
01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:49.670
You are to them go and the allergy that should come from hearing and excuses.

1610
01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:54.260
The allergic reaction to hearing someone tell you it's their fault or,

1611
01:38:54.330 --> 01:38:57.060
or it's not.
It's not their fault.
It's somebody else's fault.

1612
01:38:58.210 --> 01:39:00.870
A hundred out of 100 times you should understand and,

1613
01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.100
and the point is that that's still hard to do.
It's still hard.

1614
01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.590
And that bridge is,
is hard to cross.

1615
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:11.580
And reading the book isn't enough.
It,

1616
01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:16.260
it sets the table and expose you to it.
But I think it comes with everything you,

1617
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:20.260
you have to get inside it,
you have to live it.
But the thing of it is,

1618
01:39:20.261 --> 01:39:22.830
is the first time you do it,
the first time you do it,

1619
01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.060
because it works every single time.

1620
01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:33.420
Once someone,
once you get to that tipping point,
once the,
the domino falls,

1621
01:39:33.421 --> 01:39:35.640
I think it's then it's like magic,

1622
01:39:35.670 --> 01:39:38.980
then it's just things are just happening on their own and all your people go,
no,

1623
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:41.970
no,
no,
no,
no.
This is,
this is definitely what we're going to do here.

1624
01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.100
We're going to tell them exactly what we did wrong,

1625
01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:46.620
how we're gonna solve the problem we're going to do to fix it and to make sure

1626
01:39:46.621 --> 01:39:51.480
it doesn't happen again.
And it deescalates the client is like,
Oh man,

1627
01:39:51.481 --> 01:39:55.140
I was really hoping we could fight and argue and you're not letting me do that

1628
01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:59.310
now because what you're saying is everything I actually really need to hear and

1629
01:39:59.311 --> 01:40:02.880
I'm forced to say,
okay,

1630
01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:04.950
let's go solve this problem.

1631
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:08.220
And when you see it from the inside out and you start to do it,

1632
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:10.290
that tipping point,
it happens quick.

1633
01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:14.160
It just takes a lot of time to get there and there's so much resistance that

1634
01:40:14.161 --> 01:40:16.440
human nature resistance to oh there.

1635
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:18.150
There's no way I'm taking the blame for this.

1636
01:40:18.151 --> 01:40:21.180
I've actually got a bunch of good reasons that I can give you a why.

1637
01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:25.800
It's not really my fault and I'm going to kind of sell like,
Hey,
boss,
you know,

1638
01:40:25.801 --> 01:40:28.050
those guys aren't,
they're not the,
they're not the best guys.
You know,

1639
01:40:28.051 --> 01:40:31.080
this is not the best team here.
Here's,
here's a,
here's a,

1640
01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:35.490
let's call it a drill or a,
or a coaching,
I'll call it that.
A coaching.

1641
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.680
When the next time you get into a situation and you write down,

1642
01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:44.850
or you can take the,
the excuses and the reasons that you come up with,

1643
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:48.540
look at them and then figure out how they work,

1644
01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:52.470
how those things were actually your fault and or how you could have prevented

1645
01:40:52.471 --> 01:40:53.860
them.
Because a lot of times it's like,

1646
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.860
<v 0>here's,
here's,
here's the one.
Uh,
hey boss,</v>

1647
01:40:56.890 --> 01:41:01.890
we didn't get the mission accomplished because the weather rolled in and we

1648
01:41:02.291 --> 01:41:05.410
couldn't launch on the mission.
That's,
that's the problem.

1649
01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:09.370
Now we all know that we don't control the weather.

1650
01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:11.410
So when you say you write the problem down,

1651
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:13.690
we failed the mission because we didn't control the weather.

1652
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:17.050
We can't control the weather.
That's why we failed the mission.
That's my excuse.

1653
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:21.250
That's a,
that's a logical reason.
There's that's,
that's a,

1654
01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:26.170
that's a legitimate excuse,
but don't use it.
What you do is you say,

1655
01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:31.000
what could I have done to have controlled the weather?
Okay,
I don't care.
Okay,

1656
01:41:31.050 --> 01:41:33.550
okay,
wait,
I can't control the weather.
What could I have done?

1657
01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:37.330
I could've come up with a contingency plan.
I could have come up.

1658
01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:41.800
We could have staged in a better place.
So then you go to the boss and you say,

1659
01:41:41.801 --> 01:41:43.930
look boss,
here's what happened.

1660
01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:49.750
The weather went south really bad.
That was a problem.

1661
01:41:49.930 --> 01:41:52.870
But it's a problem that I should have done a better job taking care of.

1662
01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:55.900
What I should've done was I should have had a contingency plan.

1663
01:41:56.260 --> 01:42:00.100
I should have staged closer to the target area that I could have taken vehicles

1664
01:42:00.101 --> 01:42:03.340
instead of helicopters.
That's my fault.
From now on,

1665
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:07.630
I will absolutely have a secondary plan.
This won't happen again.

1666
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:09.010
We can't control the weather,

1667
01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:13.120
but we can control how we plan and how we execute and this won't happen again.

1668
01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.500
There you go.

1669
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.650
So you take the most outrageous thing that you know you can't control.

1670
01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.680
You figure out a way to control it and you take ownership of that thing and it

1671
01:42:23.441 --> 01:42:26.800
is going fade.
It's gonna make your life so much better.
And by the way,

1672
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:31.630
the next time you have a mission and you plan that contingency and you actually

1673
01:42:31.631 --> 01:42:33.910
execute and implement what you said you're going to do,
guess what?

1674
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:35.410
You will accomplish the mission.

1675
01:42:35.850 --> 01:42:40.150
There's a whole part of ownership that preempts the problem.

1676
01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:43.600
If you've got someone that knows,
if I know that I can make an excuse,

1677
01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:45.820
if I know that I can make an excuse,
then guess what?

1678
01:42:45.821 --> 01:42:47.800
I'm not going to set things up properly.

1679
01:42:48.190 --> 01:42:52.990
If I don't set things up properly more often or more often than the other way,

1680
01:42:52.991 --> 01:42:57.010
I will fail to to execute what I'm supposed to execute.
If you have an excuse,

1681
01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:00.010
right?
Same.
Same thing with you as an individual human being.

1682
01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.710
Have you as an individual human being,

1683
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:08.040
if you got some excuses that you can throw out there that you can say,

1684
01:43:08.291 --> 01:43:12.430
I had no control over that,
then you know what you say,
okay,

1685
01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:15.190
what are my contingency plans?
What could I have planned differently?

1686
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:19.870
Let's eliminate those excuses.
Take ownership of your freaking life.
Yeah,

1687
01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:22.600
and in that situation too,

1688
01:43:22.601 --> 01:43:27.130
when you're talking about this example of the weather and if you as a leader

1689
01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:29.970
actually accept the excuse like,
Hey boss,

1690
01:43:29.971 --> 01:43:33.460
I that that storm rolled in and just crushed us,
and you're like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1691
01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:36.160
Out of your control,
there's no way he have solved for this problem.

1692
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:36.994
It's unsolvable.

1693
01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:41.220
What have you just guaranteed it will happen every single time the weather rules

1694
01:43:41.230 --> 01:43:44.710
in you set that in stone.
It will never be different.

1695
01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:47.380
The weather will crush you every single time.
Or You could go,
I don't know,

1696
01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:52.370
look at your weather app and go,
we got to go six early in stage

1697
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:57.470
<v 2>and we're going to walk in and it works both ways at the at and if you accept</v>

1698
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:01.180
those excuses,
you're now doing that.
That's a free pass for eater on that.

1699
01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:03.140
The weather is actually something we can't control.

1700
01:44:03.141 --> 01:44:07.010
So that was now something that is okay,
why we fail.
Um,

1701
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:11.660
yeah,
it's,
I understand that it's hard.
I know that feeling and that,

1702
01:44:11.661 --> 01:44:14.380
but when you see it get to the other side and you see people doing like don't,

1703
01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.340
that was sort of like a turning point for me mentally because I,
as I,

1704
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.490
as I grew up and I said to myself,
you know,

1705
01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:27.920
I understood that I needed to take responsibility for what was happening,

1706
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:33.850
but the turning point for me came when I realized that no matter what happened,

1707
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:38.360
if I'm the guy in charge,
if I'm the guy in charge,

1708
01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:41.990
we need to get this thing done.
That's the way it is.
And when you,

1709
01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:44.390
when you have that thought in your brain,

1710
01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:48.080
the preparation you do is so much more solid because there's no way out.

1711
01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:53.630
There's no way out.
So you've got to execute.
Yeah.
When,

1712
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:58.280
when leaders see the world like that,
when they see it that way,

1713
01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.610
they'd just work until the problem gets solved.

1714
01:45:01.611 --> 01:45:06.230
They just do everything they need to do until they find a way to fix the problem

1715
01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:10.210
to solve it.
And when they don't think like that,
they there,

1716
01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:13.340
there are outlets there off ramps to be like,
ah,
can't do it.
Can't do it,

1717
01:45:13.341 --> 01:45:17.330
can't do it,
can't do it.
And we used to,
we call that the excuse matrix,

1718
01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.320
that's the word you're like,
oh,
it comes the,
excuse me.
Checks.
Yeah.
And then,

1719
01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:24.470
and then the other part of this you've got to remember is that this doesn't
mean,

1720
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:29.890
this doesn't mean that I'm going to bang my head up against the wall 47 times to

1721
01:45:30.681 --> 01:45:35.390
accomplish the mission.
That it's like,
oh,
guess what apart part of this is,

1722
01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:37.400
hey,
I didn't plan it.
Well,

1723
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:43.030
I made some mistakes I didn't calculate correctly and now we are not going to

1724
01:45:43.581 --> 01:45:46.610
get this done.
And that's the way it is.

1725
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:50.600
And so I'm not saying you continue to beat your head against the wall.

1726
01:45:50.601 --> 01:45:52.640
47 to 47 is the limit.

1727
01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:56.210
Don't do 48 when you've done 48 and you've gone too far,

1728
01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.360
you're not going to get through the wall.
Trust me.
If you can get through a wall,

1729
01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:03.680
it'll get through by the 47th headbutt after that is not happening.

1730
01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:07.040
So you've got to take a little,
uh,
you got to look for the alternate route.
Yeah,

1731
01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:08.660
so there's a difference.

1732
01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:12.230
There's a difference between we're going to get this done no matter what,

1733
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:17.320
and we're going to get this done.
No matter what
you do.

1734
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:22.090
Sometimes you got to back off.
Sometimes you gotta re attack.
Yeah.

1735
01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:24.830
Sometimes you got to reassess your plan and somebody to,
to get,

1736
01:46:24.831 --> 01:46:26.240
you got to go a different direction.

1737
01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.720
And when it all costs doesn't mean I'm going to charge that elevated machine gun

1738
01:46:31.911 --> 01:46:35.690
deaths through open ground,
wave after wave after wave,

1739
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:37.910
it means you're going to do something else.

1740
01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.310
It doesn't mean you're going to abandon the attack on that position,

1741
01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:45.080
but you might actually do it a different way and it may be like,
my plan sucked.

1742
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:49.770
Here's all the things that I learned about my stupid plan.
Anybody got an,

1743
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:52.470
and maybe I can get some help.
He does.
I've seen this before.
This is what we did.

1744
01:46:52.471 --> 01:46:57.360
That's a good idea.
Let's do that.
Plant and you know,
we,

1745
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:58.860
again,
we could talk about this for a long time,

1746
01:46:58.861 --> 01:47:03.210
but I think that natural tendency to be exposed as,

1747
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:08.300
as someone who doesn't know something to be exposed as someone who doesn't have

1748
01:47:08.521 --> 01:47:11.790
all the answers to expose,
as a leader who doesn't know everything,

1749
01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:17.760
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
Everybody already knows that.

1750
01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:21.150
Everybody knows that you don't know everything.

1751
01:47:21.151 --> 01:47:23.520
And if you try to act like you do it,

1752
01:47:23.521 --> 01:47:25.590
we'll make it 10 times worse than just saying,

1753
01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:29.340
I actually don't know what to do here.
Or I made a mistake here.

1754
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:32.850
When you make a mistake,
everybody knows it.

1755
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:35.550
Your subordinates know at your peers,
know what your boss has,
no it.

1756
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.090
And the worst thing you can do is to tell them that you didn't.

1757
01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:44.540
That's why being insecure in your leadership capabilities is a downward spiral

1758
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:50.320
because the more insecure you are,
the more you try and manipulate,

1759
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:51.390
maintain everything,

1760
01:47:51.391 --> 01:47:53.880
and keep everything under your wraps and do everything your way.

1761
01:47:53.881 --> 01:47:58.560
And that's how it is.
So when you're insecure as a leader and that's another,

1762
01:47:58.561 --> 01:48:01.530
that's another thing that takes a little bit of a leap of faith.

1763
01:48:01.531 --> 01:48:04.770
That's another like progression that I personally made.

1764
01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:08.580
I personally made a novel,
I can't remember when,
but when I was like,

1765
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:13.020
you know what?
It's okay.
It's okay.

1766
01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:18.120
I'm not going to be,
I'm not the best in the world,

1767
01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:22.050
and everybody knows that in.
The more I tried to act like that,

1768
01:48:22.051 --> 01:48:26.160
the more obvious that's going to be.
And the minute you say that,

1769
01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:30.540
the minute you recognize that people are going,
hmm,
okay,

1770
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:32.400
he might not be the best,

1771
01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:36.930
but at least he knows that as opposed to he's not the best and he thinks he is.

1772
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:40.670
That's a nightmare.
That was a work for that guy.
And the,

1773
01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.520
the best part about what you just said is that that's something that we all had

1774
01:48:44.521 --> 01:48:47.910
to learn.
That's something we'll have to figure out at some point in our life.

1775
01:48:47.911 --> 01:48:51.150
None of us were born of like,
oh no,
I knew all this at birth.

1776
01:48:51.710 --> 01:48:55.110
It's it from these giant errors that we've made are giant mistakes with these

1777
01:48:55.111 --> 01:48:55.831
giant realizations.

1778
01:48:55.831 --> 01:49:00.831
Like I've been doing it wrong and everybody has to figure that out.

1779
01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:02.820
And then,
and that right there,

1780
01:49:02.850 --> 01:49:07.850
that is one of the most gratifying things about what we do now is that this gap

1781
01:49:08.671 --> 01:49:09.660
that we talked about earlier,

1782
01:49:09.661 --> 01:49:13.200
this little gap between like how do you read something,

1783
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.060
you read something and then how do you get that thing out of it?

1784
01:49:18.061 --> 01:49:22.650
How do you extract that vital piece of information that's in there?

1785
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.890
How do you do that?
How do you tell?
Look,

1786
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:27.720
it's like when you're a kid and you don't listen to your parents,
right?
You just,

1787
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:29.700
how do you get that?
He'd close that gap.

1788
01:49:29.701 --> 01:49:34.701
And what's awesome about what we do now is that we get to close that gap with

1789
01:49:34.861 --> 01:49:37.530
people we'd get,
I mean,
I see it on a daily basis,

1790
01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.050
on a daily basis with the leaders that we work with.

1791
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.400
You get to see their eyes open up and you go,
boom,
they get it.
Now.

1792
01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.220
Everything we just talked about,
which know,
which we had to learn

1793
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.970
<v 0>over time and extrapolate from our experiences.</v>

1794
01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:56.430
And then on top of that go through horrible situations where we failed as

1795
01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:00.940
leaders and we've figured out a way to say,
look,
here it is.

1796
01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:02.590
Here's how it works.

1797
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:06.650
And to see people's eyes open up and then to see the performance,

1798
01:50:07.210 --> 01:50:12.210
that's the best to see the performance go through the roof as the leader.

1799
01:50:13.631 --> 01:50:15.880
And then of course when the leader starts doing well,

1800
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:18.880
then the leaders start doing well.
And when all the leaders start doing well,

1801
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:20.710
guess what?
Now we have a winning team.
Yeah.

1802
01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:26.260
<v 2>To emphasize what you said,
that eyes opening,</v>

1803
01:50:26.530 --> 01:50:30.130
that's a literal thing.
Like they don't,
it's not a metaphor.

1804
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:34.660
You look at them and when you finally get it to click,
when you,
when it,

1805
01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:39.670
their eyes actually open up and they sit up straight and they kind of sit back a

1806
01:50:39.671 --> 01:50:44.130
little bit and there is a moment,
a physical moment,

1807
01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.950
you recognize that they got it.
Yup.
And when you see that,

1808
01:50:48.370 --> 01:50:51.040
and you can actually sit in an audience,
when you,
when you,
when you're,

1809
01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:52.000
when you're talking to a group,

1810
01:50:52.001 --> 01:50:54.460
like maybe multiple leaders on a team and you were around a conference table and

1811
01:50:54.461 --> 01:50:57.220
you're interacting and you bring up a particular example that they're dealing

1812
01:50:57.221 --> 01:50:57.700
with,

1813
01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:01.060
you lay out the different possible scenarios and the one that is obviously the

1814
01:51:01.061 --> 01:51:04.690
right one,
and they go,
oh,
oh my God,
when they get that,

1815
01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:09.820
that feeling is unbelievable.
It's the best part about this is when they get it.

1816
01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:13.310
But you literally see that happen.
Yeah.
Uh,
and that is,
yeah.

1817
01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.580
<v 0>Awesome.
And that's that for me.
So when I,</v>

1818
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:17.530
my last three years when I was in the teams and I was working,

1819
01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:21.400
running the training for the west coast seal teams,
and I got to see that,

1820
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:25.370
I got to see that with these young leaders and just our abs.
It's,

1821
01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:27.160
it's in my head,
right?
I gotta,
I gotta tell this story.

1822
01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:31.210
There's a young kid who I know who's an awesome guy and I didn't really know him

1823
01:51:31.211 --> 01:51:31.781
that well at the time,

1824
01:51:31.781 --> 01:51:35.230
but he was kind of like a pipe header and a platoon and there's total mayhem

1825
01:51:35.231 --> 01:51:39.070
going on,
total chaos going on.
And I just like go over to him and like his,

1826
01:51:39.071 --> 01:51:41.980
you know,
his platoon commander was simulated dead and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1827
01:51:41.981 --> 01:51:45.820
blah and doing chief was simulated at an Lpo,

1828
01:51:45.821 --> 01:51:47.710
wasn't making a call and it's total chaos ma'am.

1829
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:52.600
And I walk over to him and I'm like,
hey man.
And he's like,
yeah.
And,

1830
01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:56.600
and I go,
hey man,
Bro,
are you going to do something about this right here?
And,

1831
01:51:56.610 --> 01:51:59.080
and that was all he needed to hear.

1832
01:51:59.081 --> 01:52:02.710
All he needed to hear was like that guy that was in charge of all this training

1833
01:52:02.711 --> 01:52:06.880
was telling me like was asking me a question.
He was questioning me and saying,

1834
01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:10.690
are you going to do something about this?
His eyes opened up and he said,

1835
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:14.380
Oh hell yes I am.
And boom,
he starts stepped up,

1836
01:52:14.381 --> 01:52:15.910
started making calls and the whole,

1837
01:52:16.210 --> 01:52:20.290
the whole paradigm in the situation completely changed cause he's,

1838
01:52:20.410 --> 01:52:25.060
he stepped up and led.
And so I got to see that then and I get to see it now.

1839
01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.910
So that's a cool thing.
Yeah it is.

1840
01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:31.810
And the stories about my experience at top gun or art are identical.

1841
01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:33.580
And when,

1842
01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:37.450
when you go on a missions and they suck and you get savaged and it's just

1843
01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:38.373
terrible,

1844
01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:42.300
<v 2>okay guys come back and,
and they're miserable.</v>

1845
01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:46.010
Losing sucks man.
It sucks when you have this

1846
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.740
<v 5>huge plenty,
you go out there and you get savaged it sucks.</v>

1847
01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:52.430
And then when you go through this whole thing and there's that recognition and

1848
01:52:52.431 --> 01:52:54.980
they change the way they breathed,
that changed the way they train,
the change,

1849
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:57.300
the way they do things with their guys.
And they go out and they come back and,

1850
01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:01.010
and when you dominate that feeling of coming back from a flight and you just

1851
01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.390
dominated,
that's a really good feeling.
And so when,

1852
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:08.690
when they do this and they start winning like you've just described you at that

1853
01:53:08.691 --> 01:53:08.871
team,

1854
01:53:08.871 --> 01:53:13.790
then they start winning dude Ben then than they are then they're thoroughbreds,

1855
01:53:13.791 --> 01:53:15.320
they're running under on that and you get as a leader,

1856
01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:19.910
get to back off and just get to watch them go dominate that feeling of being

1857
01:53:19.911 --> 01:53:22.400
successful.
When you implement these things as a leader,

1858
01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:24.650
that's the best feeling in the world.

1859
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:29.000
And when you see that on for from your juniors,

1860
01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:31.640
more from your subordinate,
from your team,
and you see them go do that,

1861
01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:37.150
there is nothing better than that.
And then you get,
well we get to see,

1862
01:53:37.170 --> 01:53:38.750
we can see,
I used to get to see this,
he to them,

1863
01:53:38.751 --> 01:53:42.680
you get to see it start to take hold of.
Yeah,
and but Echo,

1864
01:53:42.681 --> 01:53:46.820
you've talked about this where I'm like,
where you,
you know what I'm doing

1865
01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.760
with you?
You know what I'm doing?

1866
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:54.740
You sat here through hundreds of hours of me talking about how I'm going to

1867
01:53:54.741 --> 01:53:58.160
treat someone on my team and you're like,

1868
01:53:58.310 --> 01:54:00.950
you know what I'm doing?
And it still works.

1869
01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:05.360
100% and what's cool is when,

1870
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:07.190
when you know what the person's doing,

1871
01:54:07.191 --> 01:54:11.180
when you know what your leaders doing and it still works,
then you go,

1872
01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:12.260
you know what,
I'm going to do it too.

1873
01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:14.690
And that's how it spreads throughout these ones out spreads,

1874
01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:17.510
because we'll get it.
So let's say,
I dunno,

1875
01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:21.710
I make a mistake or something like that and you say,
hey,
it's,
you know,

1876
01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:26.940
I should have done this better.
Right?
So it was like obvious,
like that's,

1877
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:29.720
that has never been your job,
not the,
you know,
since whatever,

1878
01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:32.480
whatever that may be.
Right.
So obviously I'm like,

1879
01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:35.730
I know you're doing your third grid,
extreme ownership,
you know,

1880
01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:39.860
just so we can get the problem.
I get it.
But to me,

1881
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:45.320
what I felt was not what you're doing,
but what you're not doing.

1882
01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:48.380
You're not telling me,
hey,
what's up with this?
You know,
hey,

1883
01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:51.110
why did you make that you're not,
you're not attacking me.

1884
01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:56.090
So I have to be defensive.
You know,
you're not doing that.
I'm just not defensive.

1885
01:54:56.091 --> 01:54:58.400
I see what you're doing,
the whole thing.
But who cares?

1886
01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:01.850
I don't have to defend myself,
so whatever.
I'll be like,
okay,
all right,

1887
01:55:01.851 --> 01:55:04.220
and you would you want to do is get it done.
Whatever the thing is,

1888
01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:06.690
we all want to get it done.
That's the thing.
We all want a,

1889
01:55:06.850 --> 01:55:09.260
even like with your wife,
that's a,
that's a huge one.

1890
01:55:09.261 --> 01:55:13.240
So you guys always talking in context of business and you know the boss and the

1891
01:55:13.610 --> 01:55:16.760
subordinates,
whatever.
Same exact thing with your wife.
Same thing.

1892
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:20.990
Even though it feels like counter intuitive,
you know you're,
you're you,

1893
01:55:21.130 --> 01:55:24.380
you had all this stuff to do that you're doing for her,
by the way.

1894
01:55:24.650 --> 01:55:26.510
And you didn't take out the trash.
I don't know.

1895
01:55:26.511 --> 01:55:28.790
I'm not saying that happened to me and not saying it didn't happen to me,

1896
01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.790
but he didn't take out the trash.
Meanwhile,

1897
01:55:31.791 --> 01:55:35.250
you did literally from the moment you will look up to that moment,
you gotta,

1898
01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:39.590
you know,
accused whatever you did stuff for her,

1899
01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.810
right?
You could have done that.
Hypothetically,

1900
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.690
you heard her saying,
hey,
you know,
you,
you,
you didn't take out the trash.

1901
01:55:48.691 --> 01:55:52.120
All those feelings in your mind and your heart is to,

1902
01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:55.530
it's not to be like,
you're right,
I should have done that.

1903
01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.620
It's not just say that as I say,
the opposite.
Yeah.
That's like

1904
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:07.500
the point where it's overwhelming.
Overwhelming.

1905
01:56:07.501 --> 01:56:10.470
Like I will not,
and cannot bring myself to say,
you're right,

1906
01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:13.050
you're right about that.
But if you can manage to do that,

1907
01:56:13.410 --> 01:56:16.680
you'd be baffled how easy,
how good it works.

1908
01:56:17.790 --> 01:56:22.650
It works.
Yeah.
But yeah,
it's,
it's what you're not doing.
I think like if you know,

1909
01:56:22.651 --> 01:56:24.270
like,
I see what you're doing,
I see what you're doing.

1910
01:56:24.271 --> 01:56:26.520
They're using your little chocolate tricks,
all this stuff.

1911
01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:30.540
That's not the influential part.
Influential part is what you're not doing.

1912
01:56:30.710 --> 01:56:34.200
You know,
it's so funny now because everyone I deal with now,

1913
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:38.970
every single person that I deal with on any level,
on any,

1914
01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:45.210
on any depth at all,
they all know all of my little tricks,

1915
01:56:45.211 --> 01:56:49.230
as you call them.
They all know every,
every person I'm involved with knows mall.

1916
01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:54.300
Yeah.
And it's like,
yeah,
but yeah.
Cool.
I'll go even one further with this guy.

1917
01:56:54.930 --> 01:56:56.040
He'll go hill.

1918
01:56:56.310 --> 01:57:00.690
It's almost like he'll double do it to the point where it's a joke insulting you

1919
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.280
and you think it's funny yet you're still not vet.
So he'll be like,

1920
01:57:05.490 --> 01:57:08.670
I dunno,
whatever.
Let's say I didn't press record on the thing.
Forgot.

1921
01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:12.630
We'll just say never done that before.
May or may not have ever done that before.

1922
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:15.870
But he'll be like,
hey,
you're right.
You know I should,

1923
01:57:15.871 --> 01:57:18.110
I should have double and triple check that thing.
You know,

1924
01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:20.520
I mean it's wherever they are,
but I still totally couldn't,
you know,

1925
01:57:20.521 --> 01:57:23.640
so obvious he's throwing it in your face.
You know that it's not his fault.

1926
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.040
But he's like going through the motions.
Almost like,

1927
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:29.220
like con kind of condescending,
you know.
But it's so funny that,

1928
01:57:29.221 --> 01:57:32.450
cause that's the rule.
So it's like he's,
he,

1929
01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:36.070
he's blaming you but he's not really officially blaming you and it says Joe,

1930
01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.740
but it still works.
That's the thing,

1931
01:57:38.210 --> 01:57:41.700
cause it's all just one in meanwhile,

1932
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:45.550
the whole recording is trashed by the way,
cause it didn't even happen.
But yeah,

1933
01:57:45.590 --> 01:57:48.450
you're not defensive because it's just,
you know,
it's like,
well I don't,

1934
01:57:48.451 --> 01:57:51.870
I don't say this.
The reason to why it works,
quote unquote,

1935
01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:56.310
the reason it works is that the reason it works with the people that I deal with

1936
01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:59.250
in my life,
for my family took my business partners across the board.

1937
01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:04.050
The reason that it works is because I'm not doing it.

1938
01:58:04.650 --> 01:58:08.160
For me,
that's the big difference.
So if you're out there and you're thinking,

1939
01:58:08.161 --> 01:58:10.290
oh cool,
I'm going to learn these tactics so I can,

1940
01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:14.260
I can get further in my life and I can get things out of the world.
It's like,
no,

1941
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:18.720
it's not going to work out well for you.
Yeah.
On the surface.

1942
01:58:18.721 --> 01:58:19.740
Cause I'm going to tell you what,

1943
01:58:19.770 --> 01:58:24.690
you got to take that one step further because guess what,
if this is the,

1944
01:58:24.691 --> 01:58:26.100
this is the amazing thing.

1945
01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:29.760
If what you're doing is you're focused on taking care of the team,

1946
01:58:29.761 --> 01:58:32.940
taking care of your people,
doing the right thing for the right reasons,

1947
01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:35.400
and you're,
and you think to yourself,

1948
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:37.910
so if you're listening this right now going,
well,
I really want to,

1949
01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:42.250
I really want to get ahead.
Yeah.
And Jocko just said,
I'm

1950
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:44.770
<v 0>not going to get ahead.
If I,</v>

1951
01:58:46.770 --> 01:58:51.420
if I put myself to get ahead,
then it's not going to work.
So this isn't for me.

1952
01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:55.950
Here's the,
here's the dichotomy in this thing and it's a huge dichotomy.

1953
01:58:56.970 --> 01:59:00.990
If you're there and you're in a leadership position or you're just in a
position,

1954
01:59:00.991 --> 01:59:05.580
you were in a relationship whenever and you're doing things for the team,

1955
01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:09.120
you're trying to take care of the others,
you're putting other people above you.

1956
01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:12.120
In the end,

1957
01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:18.500
you're going to win and you're going to win way bigger than you could if you

1958
01:59:18.961 --> 01:59:23.220
were crawling and scratching and ripping things and bringing them back to

1959
01:59:23.221 --> 01:59:26.790
yourself.
The end,
that person that thinks,

1960
01:59:26.970 --> 01:59:30.510
that thinks that they're doing the right thing or thinks that they're doing

1961
01:59:30.511 --> 01:59:31.680
something good for themselves,

1962
01:59:31.681 --> 01:59:34.890
but what they're really doing is taking things from other people.
That person,

1963
01:59:35.010 --> 01:59:38.820
they might get a couple of tactical victories along the way,
but in the end,

1964
01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:42.870
the person that puts everyone else first is going to win.

1965
01:59:42.930 --> 01:59:46.380
They are going to win.
So it's,

1966
01:59:46.410 --> 01:59:49.440
it's kind of hypocritical because it's like in one hand it's like,
no,

1967
01:59:49.441 --> 01:59:52.380
I don't care about myself.
I'm not trying to improve.

1968
01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:56.940
I'm not trying to try and improve my station in life.
But by doing that,

1969
01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:00.240
you will improve your station in life and you will improve your station in life

1970
02:00:00.241 --> 02:00:05.241
beyond anything that you could've done if your goal was to improve your station

1971
02:00:05.641 --> 02:00:08.070
in life.
It's true.

1972
02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:09.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1973
02:00:09.450 --> 02:00:13.200
<v 0>That's good stuff right there.
Yes.
Here it is.
Take note of that one.
Yeah.</v>

1974
02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:16.620
Any other major topics that you want to bring up tonight?

1975
02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:22.590
<v 5>It works especially with your wife.</v>

1976
02:00:23.970 --> 02:00:28.650
Not also,
but especially with your wife.
Yeah.

1977
02:00:29.130 --> 02:00:33.060
And so it should just be habit that anytime she says you didn't do this,

1978
02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:39.150
it actually she's right.
You didn't.
Yeah.
And just be like,
you're right.
I didn't,

1979
02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:44.130
yeah,
I have learned that lesson.
Yeah.
A few times.
Yeah.
And,
and again,

1980
02:00:44.131 --> 02:00:45.600
this is going to sound obvious,

1981
02:00:45.601 --> 02:00:48.330
but it's one of the things you've got to kind of consciously remember,

1982
02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:50.430
especially if you're with your wife,

1983
02:00:50.431 --> 02:00:54.120
with someone you're with every day or really,
really often the part,
yeah.

1984
02:00:54.121 --> 02:00:56.820
You take it,
you take ownership,
you know,
you take responsibility,

1985
02:00:56.970 --> 02:00:59.610
but then you actually do have to actually solve the problem.
Yep.

1986
02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:03.150
Because if you're like,
hey,
you ride in and take out that trash,
you know,
I mean,

1987
02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:06.510
you know,
uh,
it won't happen again.
And then tomorrow,
same thing come out.

1988
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:08.520
Same thing next week,
same thing,
same thing.
Yeah.

1989
02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:12.170
Then you just sort of become the husband that doesn't take out the trash and it

1990
02:01:12.171 --> 02:01:15.620
just says,
yeah,
it's my fault kind of thing.
And you,
you the become the end.

1991
02:01:15.621 --> 02:01:18.450
That's my bad,
my bad,
my bad,
my bad.
Sorry about that.

1992
02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.930
And then that's all you do is say that it's on me.
Yeah.

1993
02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:26.760
And yeah,
so don't,
I mean obviously don't be letting the volt one of you trick,

1994
02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:29.720
take out the trash once in a while kind of thing.
You know,

1995
02:01:29.730 --> 02:01:34.170
obviously you don't say that.
Um,
but you actually do have to take out the trash.

1996
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:39.090
<v 0>You do problems get solved.
See,
I learned that from Jocko.
All right,</v>

1997
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.550
that's a good one.
And Dave,
obviously,

1998
02:01:43.551 --> 02:01:45.440
thank you for coming on again,

1999
02:01:46.190 --> 02:01:51.190
thanks for your service in the Marine Corps and for everything you've done for

2000
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:52.663
America.

2001
02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:57.350
It's always an honor to have known you to have worked with you.

2002
02:01:57.351 --> 02:01:59.900
And it's an honor to be working with you right now.

2003
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:04.610
And I actually want to close out this conversation with another letter.

2004
02:02:05.670 --> 02:02:06.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2005
02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:08.980
<v 0>And it's also written by that same,</v>

2006
02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.390
that same young,
articulate,

2007
02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:17.260
even poetic Marine Corps machine gunner,

2008
02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:19.930
Saul Seagal,

2009
02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.990
who wrote the letter that opened this podcast.

2010
02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:27.250
And this one is written to the cousin of one of his comrades,

2011
02:02:28.570 --> 02:02:32.410
one of his comrades named James Trowbridge.

2012
02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:39.150
And the cousin did not know what happened to her cousin,

2013
02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:40.680
Corporal Trowbridge,

2014
02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:46.080
who had gone missing in World War One and she didn't know what happened to him.

2015
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:51.470
And so this is another letter written after the end of the war.

2016
02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:56.190
It's dated February 18th,
1920

2017
02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:58.450
<v 1>okay.</v>

2018
02:02:58.450 --> 02:03:02.290
<v 0>And it reads my dear Miss Trowbridge,</v>

2019
02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:07.810
my old sergeant major Clifford has written me and has enclosed a copy of your

2020
02:03:07.811 --> 02:03:11.080
letter to him in which you request information concerning your cousin,

2021
02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:13.660
Corporal James H Trowbridge.

2022
02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:19.870
It is it indeed unfortunate that his family should be left so uncertain

2023
02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:22.090
concerning his sad end.

2024
02:03:22.450 --> 02:03:26.770
I know that it has been the cause of great concern with you.

2025
02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:28.480
I am sorry to that.

2026
02:03:28.481 --> 02:03:32.860
I had not known of this before for I was the last of his friends to see him

2027
02:03:32.861 --> 02:03:35.800
alive.
No,

2028
02:03:35.801 --> 02:03:40.801
Sergeant Clifford wrote me January 16th I have been out adventuring in the oil

2029
02:03:41.051 --> 02:03:45.780
fields of northern Texas and I have only lately ventured back into civilization.

2030
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:47.780
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2031
02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:52.400
<v 0>your letter was forwarded to me from my home in a while and I received it</v>

2032
02:03:52.401 --> 02:03:55.910
tonight and I'm taking this first occasion to answer it.

2033
02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:58.130
I hope it will clear up Jim's case.

2034
02:03:58.670 --> 02:04:01.760
If there's anything I can do in the future and he service,
I can perform.

2035
02:04:01.761 --> 02:04:04.340
Any advice I can offer to Jim's folks,

2036
02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:07.730
I will be at their service at all times.

2037
02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2038
02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:12.250
<v 0>We who have survived this,</v>

2039
02:04:12.251 --> 02:04:17.251
how on earth count it the least we can do to console the sorrowing mothers and

2040
02:04:18.941 --> 02:04:22.180
families of our dead comrades in arms.

2041
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:25.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2042
02:04:25.530 --> 02:04:29.160
<v 0>I still remember when I first met Jim,
it was in Bella Woods.</v>

2043
02:04:30.150 --> 02:04:30.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2044
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:34.790
<v 0>On the 13th of June we were making ready for the attack when replacements</v>

2045
02:04:34.791 --> 02:04:36.920
arrived to fill up our broken ranks.

2046
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:42.120
Jim was assigned to my gun crew and the way he went over the top,

2047
02:04:42.121 --> 02:04:44.790
like the brave soldier,
he always was,

2048
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:49.350
and his subsequent actions made me his proud friend and comrade

2049
02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:52.820
<v 1>to the day he went west.</v>

2050
02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:00.600
<v 0>I still remember one night on guard with Jim in the little hole alongside the</v>

2051
02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:06.100
night,
held an eerie stillness a night fit for such a hell hole.

2052
02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:12.560
I was definitely tired and though there was no wire,

2053
02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:15.560
only an empty space between the Germans and us.

2054
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:20.060
I slept 10 gym like the good pal.

2055
02:05:20.061 --> 02:05:24.140
He was kept watch until the officer of the watch came by when he awakened me

2056
02:05:24.141 --> 02:05:26.840
that I might not be shot for sleeping at my post.

2057
02:05:29.290 --> 02:05:33.160
It was for deeds like that that every man in the company idolized him

2058
02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:40.200
and I can assure you that Jim Trowbridge name and memory will forever be held in

2059
02:05:41.291 --> 02:05:44.380
reverence by the survivors of the 23rd company.

2060
02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:46.873
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2061
02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:52.300
<v 0>so many men were wounded and left us then came back during the battles that</v>

2062
02:05:52.731 --> 02:05:57.380
followed bellow woods to the last phase of the are gone drive that I must

2063
02:05:57.381 --> 02:06:02.360
confess ignorance as to whether Jim was or not.
You see,

2064
02:06:02.361 --> 02:06:07.190
Jim was assigned to a crew of his own and a machine gun of his own and on the

2065
02:06:07.191 --> 02:06:08.024
battle line,

2066
02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:12.560
the number one and number 10 gun maybe in the same company.

2067
02:06:12.710 --> 02:06:14.870
Yet they are a world apart.

2068
02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:21.800
Each carries on and knows that the other is carrying on and sold.

2069
02:06:21.801 --> 02:06:22.790
The battle is won.

2070
02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:31.040
Yet I dimly remembered that Jim was either gassed or wounded in the champagne

2071
02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:36.060
drive in which the second division captured Montblanc Ridge.

2072
02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:42.260
It began on October 2nd,

2073
02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:45.920
1918 Jim came back to us before the last phase of the are gone drive,

2074
02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:48.890
which began on November 1st,

2075
02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:53.750
1918 through the mud and rain and fog.
We pushed forward over the top,

2076
02:06:53.751 --> 02:06:57.770
that Glorious Day,
the second division leading the whole army.

2077
02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:05.330
We captured every piece of Bush field artillery,
white hot.
They were,

2078
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:08.540
and we sent the German scurrying back and broke.

2079
02:07:08.541 --> 02:07:11.090
They're invincible line to bits.

2080
02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:19.840
My company suffered terribly in dead and wounded.
Yeah.

2081
02:07:19.841 --> 02:07:24.841
We carried on hungry and tired and facing the everlasting hail of bullets and

2082
02:07:25.181 --> 02:07:26.014
shells.

2083
02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:27.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2084
02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:30.890
<v 0>We pushed forward for six days battling steadily.</v>

2085
02:07:32.690 --> 02:07:33.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2086
02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:35.000
<v 0>The 6th of November rose.</v>

2087
02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:41.870
I remember passing gym by the road side and he gave me a cheery hale.

2088
02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:48.420
Then he followed up the rear.
We went forward and the Boesch began shelling us.

2089
02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.390
As the last of the column came up,

2090
02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:56.630
I heard from them that Jim's crew had rested once again by the road side.

2091
02:07:57.210 --> 02:08:00.030
None of us were strong.
We had not eaten in days.

2092
02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:07.110
A great shell had exploded and it killed and wounded all of Jim's crew.

2093
02:08:07.410 --> 02:08:11.310
Jim had had a foot torn off by a flying fragment.

2094
02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:17.440
There was death and destruction all about.

2095
02:08:17.650 --> 02:08:21.640
I volunteered to help carry a wounded man back to the first aid station.

2096
02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:24.513
<v 1>There</v>

2097
02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:27.480
<v 0>was Jim lying on the blanketed floor.</v>

2098
02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:29.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2099
02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:31.460
<v 0>I knelt down to speak to him.</v>

2100
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:33.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2101
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:38.350
<v 0>I mark that his face was already drawn with pain and that he was gray from long</v>

2102
02:08:38.961 --> 02:08:41.030
exposure and loss of blood.

2103
02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:48.630
He said,
Saul,
old bow,
I'm dying.

2104
02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.850
Good luck to you.
Old Man.
I tried to cheer him up,

2105
02:08:56.150 --> 02:08:57.110
but to no avail

2106
02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:02.620
on the battlefield one knows when death approaches.

2107
02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.153
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2108
02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:07.910
<v 0>that is all I know.</v>

2109
02:09:09.370 --> 02:09:12.310
For a few hours later I was knocked out myself

2110
02:09:15.070 --> 02:09:20.070
yet I doubt not the gym went west to home and to mother soon after

2111
02:09:23.190 --> 02:09:28.190
whether Jim died and was buried in the village a few miles south of Sudan in the

2112
02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:32.400
Ardennes Department or whether he survived until he reached the hospital.

2113
02:09:32.730 --> 02:09:33.660
I do not know.

2114
02:09:35.970 --> 02:09:40.230
You can find out by writing the graves registration bureau at Washington

2115
02:09:42.150 --> 02:09:45.630
that he is gone.
I am reasonably sure

2116
02:09:47.130 --> 02:09:51.870
I would advise his family to harbor.
No unfounded hopes and his safety.

2117
02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:59.980
It is with deep regret that I ask yours.

2118
02:10:00.130 --> 02:10:04.090
And Jim's mother's pardon for my heart.
Listen,

2119
02:10:04.091 --> 02:10:05.680
brutal description of this story.

2120
02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:10.860
My experiences on the battlefield of caused me to use other than Tinder words

2121
02:10:11.290 --> 02:10:13.210
that might sue the brokenhearted mother.

2122
02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:19.760
Believe me,
nevertheless,

2123
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:24.170
that I grieve with her for her son and my comrade.

2124
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:26.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2125
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:27.940
<v 0>And believe me too,</v>

2126
02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:33.180
that I stand ready to do all in my power to assist her in any possible way.

2127
02:10:37.380 --> 02:10:38.213
<v 4>It is hard,</v>

2128
02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:44.060
I know yet at such a cost has liberty and democracy survived

2129
02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:52.140
except my dear Ms Trowbridge,

2130
02:10:53.070 --> 02:10:56.220
the assurance of my profound

2131
02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.630
<v 1>respect,
most sincerely</v>

2132
02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:05.740
Saul Segal.

2133
02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:14.073
<v 4>So</v>

2134
02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:19.600
liberty and democracy survived

2135
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:25.303
but

2136
02:11:27.050 --> 02:11:31.430
at such a cost and so many bore that cost.

2137
02:11:32.690 --> 02:11:36.200
The fighting that salsa girl writes about

2138
02:11:38.150 --> 02:11:40.670
was part of the Muse Argon offensive.

2139
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.690
Here's part of the hundred days offensive

2140
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.320
that brought the war to an end

2141
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:53.220
and we'll bring you into the war to the end.

2142
02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:58.770
It cost the lives of 26,277 Americans.

2143
02:12:00.970 --> 02:12:01.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2144
02:12:01.810 --> 02:12:05.960
<v 4>And Corporal James Trowbridge was one of those Americans.</v>

2145
02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:10.530
He died around the 6th of November,
1918 okay.

2146
02:12:13.570 --> 02:12:14.403
<v 1>And as we know</v>

2147
02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.070
the armistice was signed,

2148
02:12:20.890 --> 02:12:24.850
<v 4>then the war ended
just five days later</v>

2149
02:12:26.490 --> 02:12:31.170
<v 1>on November 11th,
1918</v>

2150
02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:39.510
war is hell.

2151
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:46.510
<v 4>Then the cost of liberty in the cost of democracy is immense.</v>

2152
02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:50.330
And I started this podcast,

2153
02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:53.300
we were talking about that quote.

2154
02:12:53.490 --> 02:12:54.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2155
02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:00.080
<v 4>The quote that says when you know the way broadly</v>

2156
02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:06.680
you see it and everything.
Well in that vein,

2157
02:13:09.690 --> 02:13:13.530
I think that if you know the cost broadly,

2158
02:13:13.650 --> 02:13:18.410
if you know the cost of freedom,
then you see it.

2159
02:13:20.130 --> 02:13:22.740
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
And everything

2160
02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:29.590
in everything
that we have been given,

2161
02:13:33.810 --> 02:13:37.830
especially our most precious gift.

2162
02:13:40.010 --> 02:13:40.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2163
02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:44.920
<v 4>And that is
freedom.</v>

2164
02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.720
And
I think that's

2165
02:13:57.430 --> 02:14:00.520
all I've got for tonight.

2166
02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:07.410
And I think at this point,
Echo,
if you want to,
uh,

2167
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:13.710
maybe give us an opportunity to decompress or,

2168
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.350
sure.
Maybe we could help you talk about

2169
02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:26.310
how we can take advantage of the freedom that we have.

2170
02:14:26.970 --> 02:14:31.410
Yes sir.
Cool.
We'll do both.
Okay.
Look that

2171
02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:35.970
support yourself too,
by the way,
Dave work.

2172
02:14:37.530 --> 02:14:39.120
So first we'll talk about origin.

2173
02:14:39.690 --> 02:14:43.670
I know little bit of a rough transition cause yeah,

2174
02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:48.270
cause that's a,
that's a letter right there.
Yeah.
Again,

2175
02:14:49.950 --> 02:14:54.630
21 now he's,
so now he's 22,000 says 1920 he's 22 years old,
Dave.

2176
02:14:55.370 --> 02:15:00.150
Yeah.
Unreal.
Yeah.
You've tried to figure out what happened to him,

2177
02:15:01.110 --> 02:15:05.550
like where,
where you went.
Did he take over like a big company?

2178
02:15:05.551 --> 02:15:09.880
He must've done something awesome.
Saul Segal,
Segal,

2179
02:15:09.970 --> 02:15:13.190
Segal.
Yeah.
It's s e,
g.
E.
L.
L.

2180
02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:17.880
He shoot him.
Become a writer.
They should have absolutely become a writer.

2181
02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.520
<v 5>Yeah.
You,
you know,
you read these letters and again you say this whole time,</v>

2182
02:15:24.521 --> 02:15:27.790
but you kind of can't help but remember,

2183
02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:31.690
especially this can letters that like this actual person.

2184
02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:34.630
It's not just some cool letter,
you know,
kind of thing.

2185
02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:38.230
It's like does the actual person writing this letter to an actual person?

2186
02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:42.910
Just like all about an actual person about James Trowbridge.

2187
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:47.650
Yeah.
Crazy.
All right,

2188
02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:52.560
well I guess we can talk about origin
made in America.

2189
02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:57.300
I guess there's that.
There's that.
So yeah.
So again,
origin.
Yes.

2190
02:15:57.301 --> 02:16:01.500
So they have American made products,
good products too,

2191
02:16:02.250 --> 02:16:05.130
as in the best.
Yeah.
I think they're the best buy.
Here's the thing.

2192
02:16:05.610 --> 02:16:07.920
You know when people are like,
yeah,
they got the best thing.

2193
02:16:07.921 --> 02:16:10.920
It's like it's a matter of opinion.
So I can't tell you they're the best,

2194
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:14.440
but I can't tell you,
I think.
Can you not say it's the best key?
Yeah.

2195
02:16:14.490 --> 02:16:19.320
Oh it's the best for factually.
That's a factual leafing.
Yep.
So gies so yeah,

2196
02:16:19.321 --> 02:16:21.600
if,
okay.
On the path we're on the path,
the Burke,

2197
02:16:21.601 --> 02:16:24.390
you're on the path on the GC path you did as part of that path.

2198
02:16:24.391 --> 02:16:27.870
Optional for sure.
Optional,
but it is part of the path cause not,

2199
02:16:27.871 --> 02:16:28.740
not part of the path.

2200
02:16:28.830 --> 02:16:33.830
You see I'm saying so when you questioning whether it's optional for the moment,

2201
02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:37.290
no,
because you've heard of people who don't necessarily do Jujitsu,

2202
02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:40.540
but they're on the pedal on the path.
If you,
yeah,

2203
02:16:40.541 --> 02:16:42.910
you should try and train Jujitsu though.
Here's my recommendation.

2204
02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:47.740
It's like strongly recommend Dave recommendation,
Yay or Nay Jiu Jitsu.

2205
02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:51.580
It's not a recommendation.
You need to do it.
Yeah,
it's weird.
It's just,

2206
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:55.360
it's something unlike anything else I've ever done and it's something you need

2207
02:16:55.361 --> 02:16:56.194
to do and it's,

2208
02:16:56.470 --> 02:17:00.970
there's a million different reasons to do it and it's,

2209
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:04.180
look,
echo,
it's not an option if you're on the path,

2210
02:17:04.181 --> 02:17:08.260
you're training when you heard it here.
So by the way,

2211
02:17:08.261 --> 02:17:10.090
representing the origin tee shirt.

2212
02:17:10.510 --> 02:17:15.510
If someone's wondering about the g designy boy you Willie.

2213
02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:17.580
So boom,
there you go.

2214
02:17:17.581 --> 02:17:20.010
So when you started you just two or if you're on that you need the bathroom

2215
02:17:20.011 --> 02:17:23.550
already.
You need a new geek or didn't get best one made in America.

2216
02:17:23.551 --> 02:17:26.160
100% cottons made it in America.

2217
02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:29.840
They make them with the other stuff obviously cause it's,
you know,

2218
02:17:30.890 --> 02:17:34.200
they got rash guards in other Jujitsu stuff on there as well.

2219
02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.210
Origin main.com joggers.
Okay.
How you feel about joggers overall?

2220
02:17:40.211 --> 02:17:44.170
I mean we come a long way.
Let's face it,
if you,

2221
02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:47.450
are you indicating that I have made some movement towards,

2222
02:17:47.510 --> 02:17:51.080
I'm going to be sporting a pair of joggers if that's what you're thinking.

2223
02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:54.140
It's not you.
There's been no movement,
no movement.

2224
02:17:54.170 --> 02:17:58.610
Still one that pre phase one,
phase one.
Yup.
They're not happening for me.

2225
02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:02.170
Would you say anti joggers?
Possibly,
cause I've been wearing a lot about to anti.

2226
02:18:02.171 --> 02:18:03.980
I don't look at people and say,
aw man,

2227
02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:07.430
I can't believe that guy is wearing joggers.
I don't care about it that much,

2228
02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:11.860
but it's still like it's a zero.
It's not a negative.
It's just the idea of jobs.

2229
02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:16.170
Well,
I have something that I don't get.
Yeah,
I dig it,
man.

2230
02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:19.080
There's lots of things that you know you might not get.
Nonetheless.

2231
02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:21.330
I am not in that boat.
I think just a lot of things.

2232
02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:26.220
I'm just saying there are things that you kind of don't get overall all depends

2233
02:18:26.221 --> 02:18:29.490
on what you mean by anyway.
Joggers tee shirts,

2234
02:18:29.550 --> 02:18:33.300
obviously Dave Burke representing big time hardcore,
if you will.
Big Time.

2235
02:18:33.630 --> 02:18:38.130
Big Time.
Huge time actually.
Yeah.
Look at that shirt.
It's dope.
Anyway,

2236
02:18:38.590 --> 02:18:41.640
there are a legit shirt sweats as well.

2237
02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:44.760
You know sweat suits most comfortable in the world.
That's factually,

2238
02:18:44.970 --> 02:18:47.740
that's like not even a matter of opinion.
Sure.
Sounds like it's not though.

2239
02:18:48.390 --> 02:18:52.380
Also supplements.
Okay.
Dig Burke.
You're on the dislocate.
Their supplements,
right?

2240
02:18:52.430 --> 02:18:57.380
Jocko.
Super Krill oil free joints.
Omega threes,
all that antioxidants in there,

2241
02:18:57.390 --> 02:19:02.370
all kinds of stuff.
Good for your joints.
Legitimately not this,

2242
02:19:02.550 --> 02:19:06.090
you know,
one a day commercial thing.

2243
02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:09.840
This is for real good for your joints.
That's that joint warfare.

2244
02:19:09.930 --> 02:19:14.250
Good for your joints in a different way,
but very good for the joints.
Discipline,

2245
02:19:14.251 --> 02:19:17.040
good for your brain,
good for your muscles

2246
02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:23.460
called discipline.
Preworkout pre cognitive,
not pre-cognitive,
but pre mission,

2247
02:19:23.490 --> 02:19:25.720
we'll call it cognitive enhancing neutrals.
Okay,

2248
02:19:25.721 --> 02:19:28.220
well you know who's down with the discipline day,
Burke,

2249
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:31.910
<v 2>I am down with the discipline.
What,
when do you take it?</v>

2250
02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:36.620
I take it usually twice a day,
so get up,
work out.

2251
02:19:37.010 --> 02:19:39.470
I'm tracking for a while and about 10 10 30 and I,

2252
02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:41.420
that's about the time I sit down and I'd have to,

2253
02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:44.990
I got to grind at my computer and I really don't want to,

2254
02:19:44.991 --> 02:19:47.530
but I need to and I got to put my brain in the,

2255
02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:50.810
I will take discipline and I'll crank for a while.

2256
02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:54.590
And then the other time I do it as typically like post bedtime.

2257
02:19:54.591 --> 02:19:59.540
The kids and I would have really liked to do is just call it a day.
Oh.

2258
02:19:59.570 --> 02:20:02.930
But I,
but I can't get some.
Yeah,
I got to that and that's,

2259
02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:05.780
that's what I'll take it.
What about pre Jujitsu?

2260
02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:09.420
I every time I go train on the,
on the,

2261
02:20:09.810 --> 02:20:12.110
on the drive I thought he'd be like,
well no,

2262
02:20:12.111 --> 02:20:16.280
not really because know he's like every time I go train I was mixing one up at

2263
02:20:16.281 --> 02:20:20.100
the house today and he's like,
oh what are we going to roll?
And I was like,
yeah.

2264
02:20:20.101 --> 02:20:21.110
And he goes,
can I get something of that?

2265
02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.380
You had to go to religious schools there.

2266
02:20:24.381 --> 02:20:27.380
These are heaping skewers or I think it might end up being four.

2267
02:20:27.470 --> 02:20:30.470
And I don't know if you noticed this,
but I had a pretty small water bottle.

2268
02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:33.390
I'm mixing up these suits.
Super

2269
02:20:33.390 --> 02:20:37.110
<v 5>charged to concentrate,
concentrate.</v>

2270
02:20:37.950 --> 02:20:41.610
I have eaten it before.
It doesn't taste good bra.
Right?

2271
02:20:41.611 --> 02:20:45.870
You don't want to have done it if I had to.
But anyway,
so that's discipline.

2272
02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:48.660
I did.
And then you,

2273
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:52.710
you take milk again.
This is good that you're here.

2274
02:20:52.770 --> 02:20:55.440
Cause I tell everyone that tastes good,
that to me,

2275
02:20:56.040 --> 02:21:00.770
but I'm only one person.
You like it to mince your flavor too,
right?
He,

2276
02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:05.640
okay.
So here's the thing,
I got to explain that because you're here,
Dave Burke,

2277
02:21:05.641 --> 02:21:10.340
you're here,
you're on the discipline train.
I dig it.
I'm on the mark train.
Okay,

2278
02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:15.320
so
here's the thing.
I never wasn't,
and even like,
you know,

2279
02:21:15.570 --> 02:21:19.500
even macro college,
a number of episodes ago,

2280
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:21.090
I would say more than once,
by the way,

2281
02:21:21.690 --> 02:21:25.320
that I'm like protein powder that's with the kids take to make them think

2282
02:21:25.321 --> 02:21:29.460
they're getting big,
whatever.
Right?
That's kind of how I felt about it and I,

2283
02:21:29.461 --> 02:21:33.420
you know,
okay,
okay,
we'll say that,
but okay,

2284
02:21:33.421 --> 02:21:38.421
so Pete sent me the vanilla who's in a blank container.

2285
02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:43.020
It's not done or,
yeah,
yeah.
So it's kind of like,
yeah.
So I'm like,
cool.

2286
02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:47.610
I put it in.
I was like,
Dang,
this is pretty good
interest is the vanilla,

2287
02:21:47.611 --> 02:21:49.860
by the way.
A good flavor.
Right?

2288
02:21:49.890 --> 02:21:54.390
I think even like one of the definitions of vanilla is like,
it's just cool.

2289
02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:57.740
It's fine.
We're not excited about vanilla,
but it's good.

2290
02:21:57.741 --> 02:22:00.300
But you were on a little bit.
I got a little bit excited.
So I'm like,
hmm.

2291
02:22:00.330 --> 02:22:03.460
But it could be my bias.
You know,
it's Pete,
you know,

2292
02:22:03.490 --> 02:22:06.660
thanks p and he get the big box here all excited.
It could be,
you know,

2293
02:22:06.661 --> 02:22:09.720
you can be biased results.
So I'm like,
all right,
you know what the test is?

2294
02:22:09.870 --> 02:22:13.320
Here's the test.
I have a one year or two year,
he's almost too,
oh yeah.

2295
02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:16.350
So I'm like,
all right,
let me back up.
So I give it to him.

2296
02:22:16.380 --> 02:22:20.940
I don't recommend giving them a bunch.
I don't know if all the protein,

2297
02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:23.820
22 grams of protein by the way,
two grams of sugar,

2298
02:22:24.050 --> 02:22:28.860
no one gram of to total carbs,
two grams of fat,
by the way,

2299
02:22:29.430 --> 02:22:32.250
which I mean feel how you want to feel about fat.
Like it's good or whatever.

2300
02:22:32.251 --> 02:22:35.670
But Bruh,
this is a for real protein deal.
Like you want an extra protein,

2301
02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:37.230
they're not going to give you a bunch of this stuff.

2302
02:22:37.231 --> 02:22:40.620
He didn't sign up for anyway,
side note.
So I'm like,
okay,
my sons,

2303
02:22:40.650 --> 02:22:43.340
do you have a real problem with things that you don't sign up for her?

2304
02:22:43.410 --> 02:22:45.800
I noticed that about him.
One of your things,

2305
02:22:45.870 --> 02:22:48.930
one of them sign up for something and it comes anyways.

2306
02:22:48.931 --> 02:22:51.540
You don't like that unless it's a box of good stuff from Pete,

2307
02:22:51.541 --> 02:22:56.430
then you didn't sign up for it.
If I do like it
there is that.
Yes.

2308
02:22:56.880 --> 02:23:00.240
So boom,
I give it to them.
Mix it up.
Nope.
By the way,

2309
02:23:00.241 --> 02:23:04.590
just to beat in the spirit of accuracy.
Boom.
Hit it.
Yeah,
you liked it.

2310
02:23:04.591 --> 02:23:07.710
So I'm like,
oh,
okay.
But it could be one of those things.

2311
02:23:07.770 --> 02:23:11.880
Was that meant or was that vanilla?
No,
Nate up Manila.
Yeah.
So I'm like,
all right,

2312
02:23:11.881 --> 02:23:15.330
well it could it be anomaly in how you give like someone that maybe thought it

2313
02:23:15.331 --> 02:23:18.720
was milk,
I don't know.
Little taste it,
you know?
So he's like more,
more,

2314
02:23:18.721 --> 02:23:21.660
more all I'm trying to get out of my phone so I can think of video to send to

2315
02:23:21.661 --> 02:23:23.700
Pete.
And he's like,
boy,
he's kind of tripping.

2316
02:23:24.140 --> 02:23:27.120
So I'm like all right until I finally get the video going and I give it to him.

2317
02:23:27.121 --> 02:23:30.360
Yeah he wants it.
Wants the milk.
Two year old drinking malt.

2318
02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:31.720
Not say to give it to your two year old's.

2319
02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:36.330
I'm saying as a taste test that works cause that's vanilla by the way.
So anyway,

2320
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:41.640
tell us,
confirmed,
confirmed and that's vanilla.
So I like the mint chocolate.

2321
02:23:41.641 --> 02:23:46.530
We better hundred percent and peanut butter chocolate is now

2322
02:23:46.531 --> 02:23:51.140
live@originmain.com.
Is that official official?

2323
02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:53.640
That's official.
Yes.
All right.
That is official.

2324
02:23:53.641 --> 02:23:57.600
So all my Twitter competition of WHO's going to get the first peanut butter

2325
02:23:57.601 --> 02:24:02.520
chocolate?
It's on.
It's good to,
it's good because I've had it cause we,

2326
02:24:02.610 --> 02:24:05.230
we test it and we went through like three.
It didn't have,

2327
02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:08.820
the cool thing is it didn't take that many iterations to get it.

2328
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:11.460
It was like a little bit more chocolate,
a little bit more peanut butter.

2329
02:24:12.030 --> 02:24:16.230
All right.
I think it was three iterations and we were good.
I will say this,

2330
02:24:16.290 --> 02:24:18.210
send it to you please.

2331
02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:23.900
I put like a half a tablespoon of peanut butter in the Mitchell by the way as a

2332
02:24:23.971 --> 02:24:28.570
test and boom.
I like that too.
So we go.
So yeah,

2333
02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:29.850
we were waiting for that anyway.
Yeah.

2334
02:24:29.851 --> 02:24:32.880
And don't forget the Krill are in the joint warfare.
These are daily things.

2335
02:24:32.881 --> 02:24:36.570
We need this.
Yeah,
take it from me.
We need this little run out.

2336
02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:42.380
Also good way to support and represent cause representing is a method of support

2337
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:48.420
in my opinion.
Jack was the store.
It's called Jocko store.

2338
02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:53.190
You can get Jocko gear,
rash guards,
Jocko gear.

2339
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:57.090
I guess like more geared towards the game,

2340
02:24:58.290 --> 02:25:01.320
get after it,
all that stuff.
Anyway.
Yeah.
Rash guards,
tee shirts,

2341
02:25:01.321 --> 02:25:03.600
discipline equals freedom,
all these things.
A lot of stuff.

2342
02:25:03.601 --> 02:25:08.400
Concepts conceptually representing by way of apparel.

2343
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:12.870
You don't like the word apparel,
clothing,
apparel,
clothing,
those things.
Fashion.

2344
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:17.340
No.
Oh,
okay.
Got You.
So anyway,

2345
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:20.790
accessories if you will.
Some some hats on.
They're some good stuff.

2346
02:25:20.791 --> 02:25:22.680
The women's stuff on there.
If you want to represent,

2347
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:25.330
go to Jocko store.com that's where you get the stuff.

2348
02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:30.010
Also you want to subscribe to the podcast.
If you haven't already,
seems obvious.

2349
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:34.150

And that's on stitcher,
iTunes,
Google play,

2350
02:25:35.230 --> 02:25:37.480
you know all these places where they play podcasts.

2351
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:38.950
Good way to support and leave a review

2352
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:41.720
<v 4>and don't forget about this podcast.

2355
02:25:53.450 --> 02:25:58.450
at this time if you want to hear him answer questions from children about being

2356
02:25:59.030 --> 02:26:00.740
a Marine Corps fighter pilot.

2357
02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:06.340
And there's also some stories from Uncle Jake in the most recent three podcasts,

2358
02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:11.690
1415 and 16 there's some stories from uncle Jake talking about how uncle Jake

2359
02:26:11.691 --> 02:26:16.691
kind of established his principles in life.

2360
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:18.320
So those are pretty cool.

2361
02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:23.440
And and in addition to the warrior kid podcast being available through the

2362
02:26:24.530 --> 02:26:25.820
various podcast channels,

2363
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:30.910
it is also available on youtube on a separate channel from the Jocko podcast

2364
02:26:32.570 --> 02:26:37.550
youtube channel,
which has this podcast on it,
which is pretty cool.

2365
02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:42.700
But it also has the custom artistic artistic

2366
02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:46.560
idioms

2367
02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:47.420
<v 5>videos.</v>

2368
02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:52.580
I was looking at enhancing and wicked cool videos from Echo Charles with about

2369
02:26:54.411 --> 02:26:58.320
whatever about whatever.
Yet and well,
hey,
we did this event.

2370
02:26:58.321 --> 02:27:01.770
We just actually David,
I just did an event and they played the warpath video,

2371
02:27:01.830 --> 02:27:05.660
the good one and it was on it.
No,
this is legit.

2372
02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:10.720
It was on a giant screen with us six sound system and it was pretty cool.

2373
02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:15.840
Yeah.
Cool to actually,
that legitimately doesn't make me feel good.
And the big,

2374
02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:19.860
big crystal clear HD TV,

2375
02:27:19.861 --> 02:27:23.620
something with the whole deal and it is a four K TV.

2376
02:27:23.621 --> 02:27:28.170
It was mass probably and I was like four feet from it cause we were about to

2377
02:27:28.171 --> 02:27:32.210
walk on stage,
so I was real close to it.
Yeah,
I know I've got the full,
yeah.

2378
02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:37.620
Yeah.
You are.
You do your Ninja pose.
Ninja Jed.

2379
02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:41.760
I don't think Ninjas do.
Nonetheless.
The youtube thing,

2380
02:27:41.761 --> 02:27:44.550
I'll think about this too sometimes,
like when one podcasts come out,

2381
02:27:44.551 --> 02:27:46.620
not necessarily art,
but you know,
other podcasts or whatever.

2382
02:27:46.621 --> 02:27:49.530
Sometimes they'll put it on youtube,
but they'll just have an image on there.

2383
02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:53.980
Oh yeah.
Just for another source of audio,
which is good.
More than that.
Yeah.

2384
02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:56.990
You've got the added dimension where we do it is a video pot.

2385
02:27:56.991 --> 02:28:00.010
So if you want to see what Dave Burke looks like,
if you don't know,

2386
02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:04.020
I'm saying we to see what it looks like.
If for some reason,
I don't know,
boom,

2387
02:28:04.021 --> 02:28:05.730
you can do what it looks like.
I liked that picture.

2388
02:28:05.731 --> 02:28:07.920
Somebody posted of what they thought you looked like.

2389
02:28:11.130 --> 02:28:14.130
You know what?
I'm going to ask that question on the soul.
Sure.
I'm gonna say,

2390
02:28:14.131 --> 02:28:18.330
what did you think Echo Charles looked like?
And we'll just see how that goes.

2391
02:28:18.390 --> 02:28:21.710
Yeah,
that seems like that.
What did you think echo looked like?

2392
02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:25.640
I think it looks exactly the way he does.
I was not in the least bit surprised.

2393
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:29.300
Oh,
you,
you okay,
sure.
Good deal.
Dave Berg.
Yeah.
Knows it,
man.
You heard it here.

2394
02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:33.260
Actually wait,
did you,
but you didn't hear me first.
You met me first,
right?

2395
02:28:33.261 --> 02:28:37.460
That was early enough.
Or did you hear,
I guess my coins.
I,

2396
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:41.320
I heard you long before I met you.
Oh yeah.
You can tell.

2397
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:47.070
Well,
boom,
there it is.
Youtube subscribe if you want.
If you'll uh,
you know,

2398
02:28:47.071 --> 02:28:51.800
in a good way to support really good.
Also to switch up your workout.

2399
02:28:52.430 --> 02:28:54.680
Get some kettlebells,
get some battle ropes,

2400
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:57.320
get a jump rope if you don't have one.
Get some.

2401
02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.500
I just got some battle ropes they didn't come in yet is I think it's good for my

2402
02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:05.030
workout.
I got planned.
Oh and I've got some rings.
Boom.

2403
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:08.190
You'd think I already had rings.
How much you talk about?
No,

2404
02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:12.480
you did not have rain.
Not Have Rings.
I had pull up bar.
I have,

2405
02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:14.960
you know that kind of,
but I don't have rings.
I have rings now.

2406
02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:17.210
I didn't come in yet.
They're on the way.
But anyway,

2407
02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:21.620
you go to [inaudible] dot com slash jock good stuff on,
oh sorry.
Slash Jocko.

2408
02:29:21.890 --> 02:29:25.910
Not Job on it.
Dot Com slash Jocko.
They got some good workout stuff on there.

2409
02:29:26.110 --> 02:29:28.160
A lot of good info too.
That's where I went when us,

2410
02:29:28.161 --> 02:29:31.820
when I was starting the kettle bar.
Bell routine.
Got got the info from there.

2411
02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:34.700
Good stuff.
Get some socks too.
By the way.

2412
02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:38.980
<v 4>Psychological warfare album,
you can get it album with tracks,
blah,
blah,
blah,</v>

2413
02:29:38.981 --> 02:29:43.930
blah,
blah.
Nobody has to deal with some people.
They didn't know what to iTunes.

2414
02:29:43.931 --> 02:29:45.270
Go to Google play,
go to MP3.

2415
02:29:45.370 --> 02:29:48.520
You can get an album with me talking about why you shouldn't be weak for the

2416
02:29:48.521 --> 02:29:50.530
various reasons.
That's it.
That's all we're saying about it.

2417
02:29:50.590 --> 02:29:55.590
Other than to say we are working on the new psychological warfare album.

2418
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:58.810
However,
each time I say that I should,

2419
02:29:58.990 --> 02:30:02.710
I should caveat that by saying I haven't had a lot of other things to do,

2420
02:30:02.711 --> 02:30:03.544
so I am,

2421
02:30:04.090 --> 02:30:09.090
the work I have done so far on the new psychological warfare album is to begin

2422
02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:14.050
to consider topics for the next album.
I have a small list.

2423
02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:17.170
It will be rolled out.
What do you think?
We'll just roll that out,

2424
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:20.260
but when people want smoking,
he said,
really?

2425
02:30:21.290 --> 02:30:23.830
Someone's out there that wants to quit smoking.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right,

2426
02:30:23.831 --> 02:30:26.230
so we're on that.
We'll put it out there.
The new psychological warfare,

2427
02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:29.320
we do have a working title,
which seems to be sticking pretty well.

2428
02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:34.970
All your excuses are lies.
Psychological warfare to,
that's the one.

2429
02:30:35.050 --> 02:30:38.920
Hopefully it'll be better than jobs too,
but not terminated,

2430
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:44.790
but not terminator to Terminator two was just as iconic as terminator one roping

2431
02:30:45.460 --> 02:30:49.240
good.
Then Jocko white tea.
You can get it on Amazon.

2432
02:30:49.630 --> 02:30:53.830
You can get the dry tea bags and mix it yourself or you can get it in a can and

2433
02:30:53.831 --> 02:30:55.930
if you get it,
no big deal.
You can deadlift 8,000 pounds.

2434
02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:00.490
Weigh the warrior kid books.
Dave,
you've read them.

2435
02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:04.450
I've read them multiple times.
They are on or reread in the house.

2436
02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:08.020
You got three kids ages nine,
seven,

2437
02:31:08.050 --> 02:31:13.050
four and their feedback is feedback is solid.

2438
02:31:14.290 --> 02:31:18.520
The girls loved the books.
Interesting.
People ask me,
what about girls?

2439
02:31:18.540 --> 02:31:20.100
Are you gonna write a book for girls?
I did write

2440
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.370
<v 5>a book for girls.
It's called way of the warrior kept.
Yep.
Yep.
Agree.
I,</v>

2441
02:31:23.380 --> 02:31:26.700
I've seen my lessons are universal.
Kids love it.
My girls love it.

2442
02:31:26.730 --> 02:31:30.300
Girls started training Jujitsu because of the book.
That's awesome.
Yep.

2443
02:31:30.360 --> 02:31:32.640
Did they study?
They study.

2444
02:31:33.780 --> 02:31:37.440
Do they eat a little bit more healthy?
Look,
they're on the path.

2445
02:31:37.650 --> 02:31:42.180
No joke here and there on the math.
It's a legit,
that's awesome.

2446
02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:47.340
And I actually talked to your kids occasionally and I see that they are in fact

2447
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:50.220
on the path.
What about the field manual?

2448
02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:56.070
They have not read the field field manual.
I have read the field manual feedback.

2449
02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:58.410
Feedback.
Feedback is also legit.

2450
02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:03.440
It is a prescription if you need some help on getting and staying on the path.

2451
02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:09.360
Read the field manual.
Have you ever read three pages of the,
of the field manual?

2452
02:32:09.810 --> 02:32:13.770
Just because three pages.
Have you just been like,
you know,

2453
02:32:13.771 --> 02:32:15.990
you're sitting there and it's on your desk and you're like,
you know what,

2454
02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:17.920
I'm going to check.
I'm going to read this real quick.
Yeah,

2455
02:32:17.970 --> 02:32:22.970
so the thing about the book is the cover of the book that cover says open this

2456
02:32:24.601 --> 02:32:29.400
book.
It's cover is awesome at that.
Hardcover is as legit man.
They asked me like,

2457
02:32:29.401 --> 02:32:32.190
all right,
when would you like to call at the soft cover?
I'm like,
ah,
never know.

2458
02:32:32.490 --> 02:32:37.410
That is not a softcover book.
No,
it is not.
No.
There's an iconic picture.

2459
02:32:37.411 --> 02:32:39.780
They say,
Echo says there's an iconic picture.

2460
02:32:39.781 --> 02:32:42.150
I think he's got a clinic Togare for that.
Took the picture.

2461
02:32:42.300 --> 02:32:46.220
Had An incredible day.
That day sense?

2462
02:32:46.250 --> 02:32:51.020
No for art.
Okay.
I didn't say that for the soft cover.
None.
Oh yeah.

2463
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:53.280
Say I don't care what the picture looks like.
There's no soft corners.

2464
02:32:54.980 --> 02:32:59.850
Well it is actually when I said it's an iconic picture means less of the notion

2465
02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:03.990
or the idea that I took a great picture or nothing like this.

2466
02:33:03.991 --> 02:33:08.700
I'm saying that picture that we took in my hallway,
one random night,

2467
02:33:09.210 --> 02:33:13.680
cheap camera became a picture.
That's kind of representative iconic,

2468
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:17.280
if you will.
Okay,
so he's claiming it of,
you know,
your whole,

2469
02:33:17.290 --> 02:33:18.530
he's trying to downplay it.

2470
02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:23.560
It could be called iconic picture that I took random night.

2471
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:25.920
No big deal.
Well you look at where the word kid,

2472
02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:30.640
the picture on the back of that one I took down too.
But is that iconic?
Not,

2473
02:33:30.641 --> 02:33:33.450
maybe not.
It didn't push me in that direction necessarily,

2474
02:33:33.451 --> 02:33:38.220
but the one on the cover of discipline equals freedom field manual is the

2475
02:33:38.221 --> 02:33:42.390
fabulous.
You're wanted a picture of me when I looked more approachable.

2476
02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:48.660
The one in the back and there's something about the warrior kid books that you

2477
02:33:48.871 --> 02:33:51.870
didn't mention though.
You said you wrote a kids book.
That's for boys and girls.

2478
02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:54.230
Yeah,
that's actually a book for adults too.

2479
02:33:54.740 --> 02:33:59.160
Now I said not just not just for the adults.
There are lessons for the adults,

2480
02:33:59.190 --> 02:34:04.190
but that book is a great parenting co parenting tool that I now get to go.

2481
02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:07.140
Is that what mark would do?

2482
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:11.940
What would uncle Jake say here and I actually get to parent less now because I

2483
02:34:11.941 --> 02:34:14.880
just referenced the book.
That's,
that's no joke,
man.

2484
02:34:15.090 --> 02:34:18.010
That word ultimate flank.
It is.
It

2485
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:20.170
<v 4>really is,
is the absolute plank because here's the problem.</v>

2486
02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:22.110
Kids do not listen to their parents.

2487
02:34:23.350 --> 02:34:26.800
Kids listen to a certain percentage of what their parents say and there's a

2488
02:34:26.801 --> 02:34:31.801
certain portion of them that is programmed to rebel against you as a parent.

2489
02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:34.690
They're programmed that way and the more you fight it,

2490
02:34:34.691 --> 02:34:39.310
the worse it's gonna get you come in from the flank.
Boom.
There you go.

2491
02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.630
Yeah,
that's true.
Good point.
What about Dave?
This is your big night.

2492
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:47.140
What about extreme ownership feedback?
Feedback?

2493
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:52.420
I've read that book several times.
I've listened to it.

2494
02:34:52.990 --> 02:34:57.990
I referenced the book constantly because of the work that we do and I get a lot

2495
02:34:58.661 --> 02:34:59.830
of feedback on that book.

2496
02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:04.300
That is the book that when you talk about,

2497
02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:09.130
when you see it broadly,
that quote from Musashi,
you start to see it everywhere.

2498
02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:14.400
That's what that book is because once you tip on that and once that gets

2499
02:35:14.741 --> 02:35:17.050
embedded in your DNA,
once you start doing that,

2500
02:35:17.470 --> 02:35:22.470
you will see that every where and that is what's unique about that book.

2501
02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:27.770
Yes,
the best feedback I've ever gotten on that book from the people that we're

2502
02:35:27.771 --> 02:35:30.940
working on until they say it just makes sense.

2503
02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:34.660
We have a follow on to that book coming out.

2504
02:35:35.350 --> 02:35:36.850
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

2505
02:35:36.970 --> 02:35:40.450
It's about all those opposing forces you face as a leader and I talked about the

2506
02:35:40.451 --> 02:35:45.451
ultimate dichotomy tonight and so that book comes out September 25th

2507
02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:50.620
also,
if you need live training,

2508
02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:53.350
you need a little bit more than the book and you a little bit more than the

2509
02:35:53.351 --> 02:35:58.351
podcasts you can bring us inside your organization.

2510
02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:00.700
We have a company called national in front.

2511
02:36:00.701 --> 02:36:03.550
That's what Dave was talking about tonight.
I was talking about tonight.

2512
02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:05.280
All the companies that we work with,
that's what we're talking about.

2513
02:36:05.290 --> 02:36:09.460
We solve problems through leadership.
Boom,
me,
Leif,

2514
02:36:09.550 --> 02:36:13.960
JP,
Dave Burke,
Flynn Cochran,

2515
02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:18.490
and now we also have Mike Cirelli in the house.
All right.

2516
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:22.480
What about the monster?
Unless her six coming up San Francisco,

2517
02:36:23.290 --> 02:36:27.190
this will be my fifth muster.
Oh yeah.
Sorry you missed the first one.

2518
02:36:27.490 --> 02:36:30.100
I did not make the first muster,
but um,

2519
02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:34.540
this muster like every other muster is a going to be awesome and be,

2520
02:36:34.541 --> 02:36:39.240
it's going to sell out.
Yeah.
Actually it's going to sell.
It's almost there.
Yeah.

2521
02:36:39.250 --> 02:36:40.750
I talked to Jimmy just the other day about it.

2522
02:36:40.751 --> 02:36:44.020
We are tracking way ahead of where we expected it is going to sell out soon.

2523
02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:46.090
You gotta get on it?
No,
because of the muster.

2524
02:36:46.570 --> 02:36:51.570
We actually designed something else because we wanted to do something.

2525
02:36:51.611 --> 02:36:53.620
First of all,
the monsters got a pretty high price point.

2526
02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:58.860
It's pretty expensive and it focuses on real broad leadership across the board.

2527
02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:03.160
But we have had come to all the ministers,

2528
02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:09.180
law enforcement,
military border patrol,
firefighters,
paramedics,

2529
02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:12.730
other first responders.
We wanted to do something a little bit

2530
02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:16.790
a little bit focused on what they do for a living.

2531
02:37:16.850 --> 02:37:19.820
So we have something called the roll call.

2532
02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:23.480
It is September 21st in Dallas,
Texas.

2533
02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:28.540
It's one day leadership seminar for everyone out there in uniform.

2534
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:33.650
So if you're a police officer,
if you're a firefighter,

2535
02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:37.460
and we've worked with police officers and firefighters and we've worked with

2536
02:37:37.461 --> 02:37:40.730
border patrol and and we've worked with military units and we still do all of

2537
02:37:40.731 --> 02:37:41.300
that.

2538
02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:46.300
But if you want to come and get a one day immersion into the combat leadership

2539
02:37:49.101 --> 02:37:51.800
principles that we talk about in the book,

2540
02:37:51.801 --> 02:37:53.870
extreme ownership that we talk about on this podcast,

2541
02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:59.360
come to the roll call,
sub tone September 21st in Dallas,

2542
02:37:59.361 --> 02:38:02.510
Texas.
And for both the muster and the roll call,

2543
02:38:02.900 --> 02:38:07.900
you can register for those@extremeownership.com.

2544
02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:10.190
On top of all of that.

2545
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:15.710
We have something now called echelon front,
Overwatch,

2546
02:38:15.740 --> 02:38:19.400
e f overwatch.com and Dave,

2547
02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:24.350
you've been involved pretty heavily in US standing that up.
We are,

2548
02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:26.870
we in our business working with companies,

2549
02:38:27.890 --> 02:38:31.580
we are always running into companies that need,
what do they need?

2550
02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:33.770
They need good leaders,
they need good people,

2551
02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:37.250
and because of our connections to the military,

2552
02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:41.390
all of us having spent extended periods of time in the military and special

2553
02:38:41.391 --> 02:38:43.880
operation as combat pilots,

2554
02:38:44.930 --> 02:38:49.790
we have connections there and this is a place where we have an opportunity to

2555
02:38:49.791 --> 02:38:51.770
bring those two things together.

2556
02:38:52.190 --> 02:38:57.170
People that want great leaders and people that are great leaders that need jobs.

2557
02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:58.790
So we're bringing those together.

2558
02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:04.240
Whether you're somebody who wants to employ people or whether you're looking to

2559
02:39:04.761 --> 02:39:09.761
be employed as a spec ops individual or a combat pilot,

2560
02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:16.280
then go to f overwatch.com put your information in there and we will proceed

2561
02:39:16.310 --> 02:39:20.630
down the line of getting you the best people you can.

2562
02:39:20.690 --> 02:39:24.080
And I miss anything on the F Overwatch.
It's is like you said,

2563
02:39:24.130 --> 02:39:26.750
and the best thing for the transitioning folks,

2564
02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:30.200
if you're looking for a new mission to find your next mission and after you

2565
02:39:30.201 --> 02:39:34.520
transitioned out of the service,
this is the place to do it.
Come and get some.

2566
02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:40.840
And if you want to kind of keep carrying on this conversation with us virtually,

2567
02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:48.070
that is until we see you in the either at the muster or at the roll call or at

2568
02:39:49.521 --> 02:39:54.200
the immersion camp up in Maine,
