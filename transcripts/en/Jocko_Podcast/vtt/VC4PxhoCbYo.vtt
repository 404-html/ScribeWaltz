00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.550
This is Jocko podcast number 72 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.300
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening,

3
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.220
sir.
Casualties are inbound.

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.330
One of the mits has been hit hard and we have casualties headed to Fallujah

5
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.920
surgical.
My head snapped up from my work.

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.760
I quickly strapped on my nine millimeter headed off to Fallujah surgical,

7
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.920
the level two trauma and surgical facility on Camp Fallujah servicing the

8
00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:40.921
casualties and medical needs of the eastern portion of Alan Bar province in

9
00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:41.944
Iraq.

10
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.540
I made a habit of going to the operating rooms to see and encourage the wounded

11
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.750
whenever I was in the command post of two expedition to Marine Expeditionary

12
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.560
Force meth forward at Fallujah.
My aid,

13
00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:02.120
Ben and I made our way through the maze of buildings and walls of the camp.

14
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.830
Something told me to hurry.

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.370
I quicken my pace then began to run.

16
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.820
I hadn't done this before and I'm sure my aid was wondering what was up.

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.060
As we rounded the corner of the hospital,

18
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.530
I could see the up armored Humvees or the Mitt team and the marines themselves

19
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.090
standing near the entrance.

20
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
They had their hands on their hips and their heads were down.

21
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.131
This is bad.

22
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:36.131
I thought one of the Marines was lifting a set of body armor from the floor of a

23
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:39.590
Hum v and it was covered with and dripping blood.

24
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.080
<v 0>I quickly cleared my weapon at the clearing barrel barrel and stepped into the</v>

26
00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:47.914
facility.

27
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.780
The medical personnel had become accustomed to my presence on these occasions

28
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:54.610
and quickly brief me on the situation.

29
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.670
Several wounded one very seriously and the survivors were down the corridor in

30
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:00.844
an office.

31
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.590
I hustled down to the office and quickly got a situation report from the team

32
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:10.750
leader and others of whom was wounded and awaiting treatment.
Yeah.

33
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.410
It had been a bad ambush and the marines had fought for their lives alongside

34
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:17.400
the Iraqi troops.

35
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:22.401
They were advising then looking up at me with an anguish you can only find in

36
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:29.240
combat.
The team leader said to me in a hush tone,

37
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.230
we think Travis is dead.

38
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.440
I didn't immediately connect the name,

39
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.970
but I knew I needed to get down the corridor right away to the ors where the

40
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:46.360
incredible surgical teams were working frantically.
On the wounded.

41
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.680
As I stepped into the first or the surgical team was just finishing their work.

42
00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.270
One of the nurses was crying openly.
They'd been unable

43
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.970
<v 1>to save this marine and he had just died.</v>

44
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.280
Seconds before I stepped into the or.

45
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.880
<v 0>As I walked to the end of the Gurney,
I was stunned to see Travis Mannion,</v>

46
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.710
the wonderful youngster I'd known as one of my midshipman's.

47
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.510
While I was commandant at the Naval Academy,

48
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.580
I had known his family,
his dad,
Tom,

49
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.350
a marine colonel himself and his mom,
Janet,
a stalwart of the family.

50
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.340
Travis had selected the core from Annapolis and though I had not seen him during

51
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:37.170
this first,
this tour in Fallujah,

52
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.640
I'd heard repeatedly of his courage and bravery as an advisor,

53
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.390
one by one.

54
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.530
The doctors and nurses left the Oh are leaving me alone with Travis.

55
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.720
I don't think I had ever prayed so hard for anyone or anything in my life as I

56
00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:58.610
did while alone with him,
and that empty o r

57
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.770
is lost was very personal to me.

58
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.620
Three years later while I was deputy commander at Centcom and headed ultimately

59
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:16.680
to command the US forces in Afghanistan.

60
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.490
I learned of an incident the previous night that had taken the lives of some of

61
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:25.050
our magnificent special operators,

62
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.870
seals from seal team three

63
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.700
they'd been operating in the Zabul province,

64
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.400
south of the Hindu Kush and Afghanistan,

65
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.050
and a generally made the lives of the Taliban miserable the entire time they had

66
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:44.780
served there.
One of the finest young leaders in this seal team,

67
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.020
Brendan looney looked and lived every aspect of the ethos of being a seal this

68
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:57.160
now legendary Strada of American special ops community.

69
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.230
That night we lost Brendan Looney

70
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.350
as with Travis.

71
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.570
Brendan's death was not simply a loss to their respective units and missions.

72
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.320
Losing them was a terrible blow to America,

73
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.260
which would now never benefit from the extraordinary qualities of these two men.

74
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.070
The irony of their relationship and their seemingly unrelated deaths was nearly

75
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:29.754
as tragic.

76
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.643
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.330
<v 0>They'd be been roommates at the United States Naval Academy growing up together</v>

78
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.450
at this most hallowed institution of on of our naval service.

79
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.770
They had faced the challenges of navy and they had emerged committed in ways for

80
00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:51.380
you can understand without experiencing the powerful formative forces of

81
00:05:51.381 --> 00:05:52.214
Annapolis

82
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.010
and in their intense sense of duty and their to serve.

83
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
One sought to be a marine.
The other a seal

84
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.490
remembering the times.

85
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.530
It didn't take a fortune teller to guess where this would lead them both

86
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.570
<v 1>okay</v>

87
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.440
<v 0>to war in Iraq or Afghanistan or both</v>

88
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.353
and to war.

89
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.430
It did lead them extracting from them long separations from their families as

90
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:29.000
they grew into the full realization of their roles as combat leaders,

91
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.800
but it also extracted from them their last full measure,

92
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.980
their young lives.

93
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.480
<v 0>Willingly sacrificed for their country and these causes.</v>

95
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.830
Tom Mannion has done us a great service in initiating the effort to tell this

96
00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:57.204
story.

97
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.180
<v 1>Okay?</v>

98
00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.920
<v 0>Yes,
it's about war,</v>

99
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.810
but it's less a history of two wars than it is about the human experience of war

100
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.220
and what this newest generation of American warriors has experienced.

101
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.970
It ties together these precious young lives and their growth together as

102
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:19.340
warriors,
as leaders
and his brothers.

103
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.790
This book celebrates what we hear more and more frequently that these young

104
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:31.270
Americans on who's broad,
strong shoulders,

105
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.460
we have fought two wars and who have kept the wolf from the door in a numerable.

106
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.050
Other places are the new greatest generation

107
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.100
with less than 1% of our population in uniform.

108
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.330
Fewer and fewer Americans bear the brunt of the responsibility for military

109
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:55.331
service and fewer and fewer understand the sacrifices made by men like Travis

110
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.850
and Brendan and they're precious troops.

111
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.120
All of us who fought in these wars now pray that in the end the outcomes will

112
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:12.210
justify the cost to America and it's allies.

113
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.770
Those of us left behind must ensure the sacrifices were not in vain

114
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.560
and that these lives lost.
We'll have meaning and purpose now

115
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.280
and in the future

116
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.590
and that is the forward

117
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.830
of a book called brothers forever.

118
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.790
Then that foreword was written by John Allen,

119
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.030
who's a retired four star Marine Corp General

120
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.420
and the book which is about Travis Mannion and Brendan Looney

121
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.360
is written by retired marine corps,

122
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:04.080
Colonel Tom Mannion,
Travis's Dad,

123
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:10.970
and we are honored today to have colonel Mannion on the podcast.

124
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.530
To give us some insight into the lives of these two amazing men.

125
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.303
Carl Mandian,

126
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.760
welcome and thank you so much for coming on.
Thanks for having me here guys.

127
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.050
Honored to have you on here and

128
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.430
I guess with a story like this,

129
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:43.431
we might as well go a little bit back to the beginning and a lot of Travis's

130
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.770
life and folks that listen to podcast or that you may remember the name Travis

131
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.270
Mannion because when Brian Stan was on,

132
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.480
he talked quite a bit about about Travis and how much Travis helped Brian try to

133
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:04.410
learn how to wrestle.
Try,
no offense,
Brian,
he did his best to teach you,

134
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.390
but it was never your best skillset,

135
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.070
but obviously wrestling was a big part of his life and I'm going to go to the

136
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:15.360
book now and here we go.
He attended classes,

137
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.490
studied and wrote his papers,

138
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.490
but always thought wrestling would best prepare him for being a warrior and

139
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:24.780
leader on the battlefield.

140
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.980
This belief was reinforced by the qualities he saw in Captain Doug Zembiec

141
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.400
Zenbeck a two time all American wrestler at Navy who attended as many practices

142
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:42.430
and meets as he could and frequently sparred with Travis

143
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.090
be a battle ax.
Zen Beck told him,

144
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.320
hurl yourself into your opponent.
I think that's good advice.

145
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:55.150
Just generally in life.
That's Doug.
Sure.

146
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.190
The a battleax zen back in 1995 naval academy graduate had a big impact on

147
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:05.160
Travis in the young wrestlers eyes.
The gritty,
tough,

148
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.130
seemingly invincible warrior embodied everything.

149
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:12.690
He wanted to become a skilled marine officer who used the wrestling mat to

150
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:16.230
develop himself into a leader who commanded respect.

151
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.280
Travis was a high school and college wrestling star after a strong junior year

152
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:26.190
at navy,
which featured several epic matches against nationally ranked opponents.

153
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.510
He was presented the Naval Academy's Weems award for dedication and leadership

154
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.190
as a preseason top 20 wrestler going into his senior season,

155
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.580
Travis didn't want to simply win matches and meets.

156
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.420
He wanted to dominate and help lead the meat.

157
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.400
Mitch Shipman to a championship.

158
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.070
So we do talk about wrestling a decent amount because we're heavy into

159
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:53.650
grappling.
So he was just started wrestling at a kit.

160
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.540
<v 2>Yeah,
he started real early.</v>

161
00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.160
He a youth wrestling up through high school.
But um,

162
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.220
like a lot of these guys at navy,
he did a lot of different things.

163
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:07.540
He did football and Lacrosse as well.
But wrestling was the,

164
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.260
the sport that he really gravitated towards.

165
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:11.890
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

166
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.940
Well there's something that makes people gravel gravitate towards wrestling and

167
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:19.590
combat sports in general,
especially if you're a guy that's in the combat.
Yeah.

168
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.560
You know,

169
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.510
there's something that's beautiful about it and so he's going now the Penn state

170
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:28.990
open,
it's like the 2004 tournament his senior year.

171
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.780
He's got a hurt shoulder that he'd hurt his junior year.

172
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.620
I'm going back to the book here.
The prudent,

173
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.990
the Purdue wrestler slammed his struggling opponent to the ground for a take

174
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:42.100
down with Travis injured shoulder thumping squarely on the red and yellow.
Matt,

175
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.530
his right arm was already numb.

176
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.890
And this first blow left Travis with almost no strength to is to attempt the

177
00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:54.070
scape in a sport built on hand to hand combat.

178
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.220
One Hand is almost always no match for to the match ended in an 11 to zero

179
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:05.050
shutout
and that,
so that's a senior year,

180
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.180
<v 2>tough day,
tough year.
You know,</v>

181
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:12.181
he had a great junior year and had his shoulder that was giving them problems

182
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.300
and instead of getting a second opinion,

183
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:21.190
he went under the knife and it was a disaster.
So,
uh,

184
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.500
start out his senior year looking forward to big year and could never get the

185
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:27.460
shoulder going again.

186
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.620
And I'm actually one depends date open with that bed shoulder.

187
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:36.220
I don't know how he did it and uh,
the rest of the year.

188
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.460
But um,
yeah,
the,
the year just didn't turn out well for him.
It's very,

189
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:46.540
very disappointing for him because he had worked so hard towards getting to the

190
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:50.710
nationals and being an all American and he had everything going his way.

191
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:54.760
But you know,
the injury just does zap them.

192
00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.750
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
and</v>

193
00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.940
obviously zap them and I can't,

194
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.330
I never put that much effort into a sport when I was in,

195
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.840
when I was in high school,
I didn't,
I didn't do it.
Am I,
am I,

196
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.990
am I kind of a loser because of that little bit.
Little bit,
little bit.

197
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.700
But I never was that into a sport.
And so I,

198
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.810
but I saw people that I knew and you definitely see it in,

199
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.150
in once you get in the teams and you meet guys and they put so much into that

200
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.880
sport,
then something like that happens.
It's crushing.

201
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.820
I didn't think this was a good little pickup that he got.

202
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.390
After a brief moment of silence,

203
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.590
the assistant coach gave Travis or reason to perk up telling the future military

204
00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:37.280
officer that though has seen senior wrestling season was over.

205
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.320
It was now time for him to devote all his energy to becoming a marine.

206
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.570
<v 2>Yeah.
And it's um,
coach Joel showered.
He's now the back at navy,</v>

207
00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:49.820
went to air force for a couple of years and came back.

208
00:14:49.821 --> 00:14:54.740
He's now the head coach down,
but a great coach,
great mentor.

209
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.100
And by the way,
it was a good friend of Doug's in Beck's too.

210
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:00.350
So it's like it comes full circle.

211
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.460
And I want to say that Joel would have been a warrior and a marine too.

212
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:08.150
He was a national champion,
Iowa,
three time finalists for Dan Gable.

213
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.660
If you know anything about wrestling.
Yeah,
he's,
he's the real deal.

214
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.130
<v 0>That's awesome.
And,
and it's interesting because in the book here,</v>

215
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.060
you know,

216
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.720
you kind of start off with that story and you can see some definite strength of

217
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:23.570
character from,
from Travis.

218
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And then you take a little backstep and you talk about early in his academy,

219
00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:34.460
a career,
he doesn't want to do it.
And it's,
he decides,

220
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.720
I don't want to stay at the academy.
I want to go to a regular college.
I'm out.

221
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.620
Right.
And he leaves.
And I thought one of the best things about this was,

222
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.640
you know,
when,
when you,
when you talk to him about it,

223
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.000
and I'll go to the book here,
you know who Travis comes to you and says,
Hey,

224
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.930
I'm leaving the academy.
And like I said in the beginning,
you're a marine.

225
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.470
You could,

226
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.190
I can't imagine you could have been any prouder than having your son go to the

227
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.000
Naval Academy.
And then the disappointment you must have had when you said,
oh,

228
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:05.810
you don't want to go there anymore,
but this is what you said to them.

229
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:10.610
Going back to the book,
look,
this is your call and your decision.

230
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.730
Tom told his son who he always believed could excel at the naval academy and

231
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:19.430
beyond,
but I think you're making a big mistake.

232
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.260
How did you know that the one of the bad things you could've done was like force

233
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:31.200
him to stay there,
which you must have decided in your head like,
okay,
I,

234
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.010
if I forced him to stay here,
he's going to hate it and he'll be miserable and,

235
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.810
and he won't put any effort into it.
I mean,
we,
we,
I get asked all the time,

236
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:40.550
but what do you do with your kids?
How much do you pressure them?

237
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.520
How did you come to that conclusion that that was the right move?

238
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.050
<v 2>He's sorta how I always work with him,
you know,
I'm try to treat them,</v>

239
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.060
you know,
is uh,
a man and let him make his own decisions,
giving them advice,

240
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:58.170
coach him.
But at the end of the day,
he's going to have to make those decisions.

241
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.120
And you know,
this was no different.
You know,
I,
I was extremely disappointed,

242
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.090
but,
um,
you know,
he,

243
00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:11.091
I had a buddy there that was a battalion officer at the Naval Academy and he

244
00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:15.580
gave him a hard time about leaving.
And

245
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.760
<v 0>was that a major Gardner?
Yeah,</v>

246
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.360
<v 2>yeah.
Lieutenant Colonel Gardner and,
and Corky gave him a hard time and said,
Tom,</v>

247
00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:25.540
I'm not letting them leave.
Let them go home for the holidays.

248
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:29.350
He'll change his mind.
And sure enough,
he came home and said,
no,
I'm going,

249
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:34.150
I'm leaving.
And I still remember quirky called me up and he said,
you know,
Tom,

250
00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:38.470
if he ever,
he did great here.
If he ever wants to come back,
you know,

251
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.760
he will probably consider it.
I say quirky.
There's,

252
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.910
there's no way he's coming back.
He's,
he's done.
And uh,

253
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.190
and sure enough,
you know what I mean?
He came back to me later

254
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.950
<v 0>on that,
uh,
that following spring,</v>

255
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:55.580
late spring to some other college,
yeah,

256
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.760
Drexel got a call from the wrestling coach come on down because I've just given

257
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:04.050
him so much trouble at home coach today.
You got a scholarship come on down.

258
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:07.860
So he left as soon as you could get out of the house.
And uh,

259
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.380
so you let him make his own decision.

260
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.290
You just made him pay for it on a daily basis.
He didn't pay for it.

261
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.290
So that's when,
when I,

262
00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:22.260
I didn't know that and I could not believe that they let him back in.
I mean,

263
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.350
that's awesome.
Yeah,
it's very,
very unusual.

264
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.250
And if you're out there and you're at the Naval Academy right now,
and I know,

265
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:32.940
I know he got quite a,
quite a few listeners at the,
at the Naval Academy,

266
00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:34.440
and at the end,
at west point as well,

267
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.200
don't think you're going to get into that kind of treatment.

268
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.720
You need to just stay there.
Just me.
It's going to be worth it.

269
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.360
You ain't gonna be followed travels,
man.
You know,
on this one.
No.

270
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.350
Pulled off a miracle and that one it really was cause unbelievable.

271
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.400
And he gets back in,
I mean I guess with his wrestling skills cause he did well,

272
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.590
did well academically,
did well on the wrestling team as a freshman.
But you know,

273
00:18:55.591 --> 00:18:59.800
beyond anything else when he quit,
it's interesting because you know,
he,

274
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.150
he quit and he left and it made him really realize what he was missing.

275
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.390
Yeah.
And when he went back in to talk to people about going back,

276
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.010
he had the passion,

277
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.100
he knew exactly what he wanted to do and they could see it in them.

278
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:14.800
You know what,

279
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.570
I would have conversations with guys that were kind of thinking about their,

280
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.630
their navy career.
And there's a big,
there's a,

281
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:25.230
there's a transition that happens mentally with people and that is if they feel

282
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:28.380
trapped,
they want to escape,
the minute that they don't feel trapped anymore,

283
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:30.980
then they're like,
oh,
I want to go back in that cage.
So you got it.

284
00:19:30.981 --> 00:19:34.560
If you can get them mentally out of the cage,
which is probably what,
uh,

285
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:37.110
what Lieutenant Colonel Gardner was trying to do is to go home for the weekend.

286
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.690
Let's see what it's like outside the cage and you're going to want to come back

287
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:42.000
into the cage.
It didn't work that time,

288
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.320
but I'm always knew it was a longer time outside the cage.

289
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.580
So when guys would come to me and they'd say,
you know,

290
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:51.000
I'm thinking about getting out,
I'd say I'd say I wouldn't go,
no,
don't get out.

291
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.940
Cause then that's,
that's tightening the cage on them.
I'd say,
yeah man,

292
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.060
start looking at what you can do on the outside.
You know,

293
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.750
why don't you go get a job.
There's some good jobs,
you know,

294
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.840
they got some good jobs you can get,
you know,
you can be an executive.
There's,

295
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:01.590
you know,
you could,

296
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.990
there's probably a good cubicle that would have a nice computer,

297
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:05.030
add it for you and everything I've done.

298
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.290
But I would not even be sarcastic about it.

299
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.200
I just try and make them start thinking about what regular,

300
00:20:10.201 --> 00:20:13.470
I mean when you're in the seal teams,
it's a ridiculously good life.
I mean it's,

301
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.570
it's a ridiculously good life.

302
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.450
So the minute you start looking at normal jobs in the world,

303
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.430
you want to get back in the cage.

304
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.220
So now he comes back and he ends up with a new roommate,

305
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.760
new roommate at the Naval Academy named Brendan Looney and I'm going to the book

306
00:20:32.011 --> 00:20:33.180
here,
Brendan and Travis,

307
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.800
who carried the burden of being division one athletes along with their academic

308
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:39.000
and drilling responsibility.

309
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:44.060
Rarely if ever complained just after the start of the 2001 fall semester,

310
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.100
Travis and Brendan met up for an early morning.

311
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.130
The restaurant and football player both had practice later on that afternoon.

312
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.220
But as to varsity athletes who want it to be the best,

313
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.190
they were determined to work harder than everyone else.

314
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.640
After talking about the start of the NFL season,

315
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.000
they're mid jog conversation shifted to their backgrounds.

316
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:08.740
They had a lot in common,
including the love of sports and their love of country.

317
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.240
Both midshipmen had been raised,
Catholic and tight knit families,

318
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.600
although Brendan's was a little larger with Brent.

319
00:21:17.601 --> 00:21:21.500
Brendan had for a total of five,
I think total of five siblings.

320
00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.980
And so now we're introducing,
you know,

321
00:21:24.981 --> 00:21:27.530
Brendan Ludy into the end of the story here.

322
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:32.650
And I actually knew Brendan slightly because when he was a seal,

323
00:21:33.261 --> 00:21:36.230
he went through the training that I ran out here on the west coast or the west

324
00:21:36.231 --> 00:21:39.690
coast seal teams and just a stud,
you know,

325
00:21:39.691 --> 00:21:43.140
that's you just stud.
And the one thing I,
I,

326
00:21:43.141 --> 00:21:45.980
well one of the things I remember about him was

327
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.940
I was not,
you know,
the,

328
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.080
the most caring and affectionate instructor as uh,

329
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.540
as,
uh,
when I was running that training and he,

330
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.390
he know and guys would get a little,
you know,

331
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.020
kind of freaked out sometimes when I'd be talking to them about the decisions

332
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:09.350
that they were making during the training.
And,

333
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.570
and he would usually just be smiling at me like yet,
hey sir,
got it.

334
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.200
It makes sense.
Or you know,
with a smile on his face,
just a stud,

335
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.930
just a straight up stud.
And

336
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.940
so these guys are now fall 2001,
and we know what's coming next.

337
00:22:23.941 --> 00:22:26.430
September 11th comes and you know,

338
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.760
our country is under attack going to the book here and the entire Naval Academy

339
00:22:32.431 --> 00:22:37.320
student body realized that after graduation they would become part of a fighting

340
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:42.300
force that was now at war.
And you know,

341
00:22:42.301 --> 00:22:46.230
that's the whole military instantly thought that,
you know,
we were all thinking,

342
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.280
oh,
here we go.

343
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.340
<v 2>Yeah,
we had,
um,</v>

344
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.470
in 2004 it started to come home to us,
it navy,
you know,

345
00:22:54.471 --> 00:22:58.460
we had a JP Blecksmith we'd lost in the battle of Fallujah.

346
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.990
Ronnie Winchester was lost over there around the same time,

347
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.390
um,
both football players,
you know,
and now Travis,

348
00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:13.220
his senior year football teams coming out with the flag and they got Ronnie and

349
00:23:13.221 --> 00:23:17.180
jps jerseys draped over the bench,
you know,
and it was,

350
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.310
it was coming home for all of us.

351
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.570
And he had guys like Doug's in coming back from the battle of Fallujah and

352
00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:26.630
talking about what that was all about,
being in the wrestling room,

353
00:23:26.631 --> 00:23:31.610
wrestling with Travis,
you know,
was was all over at navy.
Yeah,

354
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.930
<v 0>yeah.
That's a total game changer.
No,
it was,</v>

355
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.290
it was definitely like that in the seal teams to,
you know,
we went from,

356
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:43.600
what was it,
years and years since Vietnam because we had some little,
you know,

357
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.370
there was Panama,
there was Grenada,
there was Somalia,

358
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:49.970
there were some things that happened,
but those were little flashes of,

359
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:53.330
of combat action and all of a sudden we were facing and what's now turned out to

360
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:56.810
be,
you know,
a decade and a half or more worth of war.

361
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:04.280
Unbelievable.
These guys,
you know,
as you said,
they're,

362
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:09.230
their intensity is just,
you know,
they,
they might have been intense before,

363
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:12.500
but now their intensity is going to be through the roof.
They know what's coming.

364
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.970
In May of 2004 Brendan and Travis graduated with their Naval Academy classmates

365
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:19.730
and were commissioned as US military officer's.

366
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.140
Brendan would go to serve in the naval intelligence community.

367
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.580
While Travis would head to the basic school for Marine Corps officers in

368
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:30.590
Quantico,
Virginia.
So

369
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:37.100
Brendan didn't get picked up for the seal teams right out of right out of the

370
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:39.320
academy,
which is fairly normal.
It's a,

371
00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.460
they only have a very small number of openings for guys in the Naval Academy.

372
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.220
And you can imagine how competitive it is to have a guy like Brendan not get

373
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:50.720
picked up is crazy.

374
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.430
And so he goes out to go good to go into the Intel community.

375
00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.290
And then Travis heads down to heads down to Quantico for the little bit of the

376
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:05.120
basic school.
And actually this was interesting and I,
I wasn't aware of this,

377
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.910
but the lacrosse championships,

378
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.170
those happen after they graduate their seat after they get commissioned it.

379
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.770
The way it read in here,
it was like it happened after they got commissioned.

380
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.660
<v 2>Well was,
it was actually,</v>

381
00:25:18.661 --> 00:25:23.100
it was the championship was after graduation weekend.
Same,

382
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.230
same weekend.
Who's been more than a weekend?
Yeah.

383
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.010
<v 0>So and,</v>

384
00:25:27.011 --> 00:25:31.090
and Brendan at some point the Naval Academy started playing Lacrosse.

385
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.260
<v 2>Yeah.
Brendan was a football player.
He went there,
it was recruited for football.</v>

386
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.580
And,
um,
played football for a couple of years,

387
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.860
dressed and played and decided that he wanted to go out for Lacrosse.

388
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.330
Um,

389
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:49.480
both of his brothers were playing lacrosse and he went out there and just picked

390
00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:53.980
up a stick,
as you said earlier,
just such a natural athlete,
so gifted,

391
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.820
big,
strong,
and uh,
you know,
picked up a stick.

392
00:25:57.821 --> 00:26:01.600
And by the time he was a senior in that,
that championship game,

393
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:05.170
if you ask anyone who was the heart and soul,
that team,
it was number 40,

394
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:09.280
Brendan looney.
I mean he,
he led them all the way to the championship.

395
00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:12.160
He and his two brothers were the heart and soul of the team.

396
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.220
<v 0>Yeah.
Unbelievable.
And so they get to the championship game.</v>

397
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.340
I'm going back to the book against Syracuse though.

398
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:21.410
Navy followed with a goal Syracuse one,

399
00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:25.820
it's third championship and five years in eighth overall title Brendan was

400
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:29.300
absolutely crushed by the 14 to 13 defeat.

401
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.340
This is supposed to be Navy's Day.

402
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.460
It would take some time for the loss to sink in.
But Brendan,

403
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:39.080
who had just played his final collegiate game and everyone associated with the

404
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:44.081
Navy program knew deep down that the team's improbable four run had been a truly

405
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:49.940
amazing feat.
I don't think I've ever felt this low man.

406
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:55.730
Brendan grumbled,
we should have won that game.
I know Travis replied,

407
00:26:55.731 --> 00:26:59.150
but don't do what I did to myself in wrestling.
What do you mean?

408
00:26:59.151 --> 00:27:02.870
Brendan asked when I lost that match and Texas I fought,

409
00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.310
my whole life was over.

410
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.600
I hadn't been that miserable since I quit the academy.

411
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.210
But there are bigger things out there.

412
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.680
Think of what we're probably going to be doing a year or two from now.

413
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.890
So same thing,
you know,
a little bit of glory getting crushed,
right?

414
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:27.020
A little glory getting crushed at the end there.
And you know,

415
00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:31.460
Travis say,
look man,
and this is true and I say this all the time,
you know,

416
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:36.800
sports with a ball and the referee and all that stuff,
it's a game.
You know,

417
00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.440
and these guys are about to go into something that's no longer a game.

418
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.540
And that's what Travis recognized and it help Brendan see that

419
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.320
going back to the book now that he was a young second lieutenant training at the

420
00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:50.550
basic school in Quantico,

421
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:54.720
Virginia was difficult for Travis to imagine that the months after graduation

422
00:27:54.721 --> 00:27:56.100
can be even more challenging,

423
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.300
but in fall of 2004 the harsh reality of war became more personal for Travis

424
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.880
Brendan and their fellow Naval Academy graduates

425
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.300
on September 2nd,
2004 Marine First Lieutenant

426
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.300
Ronald Winchester,
a driven popular former navy football player,

427
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.470
became the first combat death and the Naval Academy's 2001 class when he was

428
00:28:21.471 --> 00:28:24.160
killed in a roadside bomb attack in Iraq.

429
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.830
I'll on bar province less than 48 hours later,

430
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.570
Travis and his fellow navy wrestling alarms were hit by another freight train

431
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.870
upon learning that Marine Second Lieutenant Brett Harmon,

432
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:41.020
a friend and teammate who had graduated in 2003 was murdered during the melee at

433
00:28:41.421 --> 00:28:45.920
a North Carolina State University football tailgate.
And that's a story that,

434
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.210
that's the story that that Brian Stan told as well.
Okay.

435
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.810
<v 2>When a tragedy that was,
I mean,
you know,</v>

436
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.020
he was stepping in to help out and the guy came back and killed him and his

437
00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:01.410
friend was hit everyone hard.

438
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.780
Brett was a really popular guy

439
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.900
<v 0>and so coach Sharat,
he,</v>

440
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.730
and again,
this is something that Brian Stan talked about,
you know,

441
00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:18.731
would when they were heading to the funeral and here we go.

442
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.490
Let's do an exercise.
This is,
this is coach rod talking.
Let's do an exercise.

443
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.750
I'd like you to both close your eyes and picture that you're leaving a building.

444
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.560
A friend picks you up and takes you to a place where people are somber,

445
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.750
crying and there seems to be an audience.

446
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.870
Then you realize you're at your own funeral.

447
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.790
Write down a few words about what you'd want a family member or a person of

448
00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:45.700
faith to say when reflecting on the lives of Travis Mannion or Brian.
Stan.

449
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.080
Stan nodded and after a few minutes of pondering what to write,

450
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.910
started drawing down a sentence about one day being remembered as a good
husband,

451
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.670
a loving father,
and a US marine.

452
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:04.210
Travis went through several pieces of paper before settling on one sentence.

453
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

454
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:10.440
<v 0>Travis Mannion was a man on afraid to stand for what was right.</v>

455
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

456
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.510
<v 0>And as I mentioned earlier,</v>

457
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:27.530
Travis started helping out Brian with his wrestling and he,

458
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.290
and eventually as Brian started fighting,
because Brian's a maniac,

459
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.010
started doing MMA matches and he needed a corner man.

460
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.600
So he needed to have the rest of corner man.
And so again,

461
00:30:39.601 --> 00:30:41.820
this is something that we covered with Brian Stann,

462
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.860
but for if he didn't hear it that first time there,
you know,

463
00:30:46.861 --> 00:30:50.940
you got Brian's about to fight.
He's literally,
you know,
whatever,
20 minutes,

464
00:30:50.941 --> 00:30:53.310
half an hour from getting in the cage and fight and somebody,

465
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:59.420
and Travis gets a phone call and Brian can tell something's going on and,

466
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.230
and Brian saying,
hey,
tell me what's going on.
Travis says,
I'll tell you later,

467
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.010
Brian stances.
You tell me now Travis looks away after the fight.

468
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.840
No,
give it to me straight.
Brian demanded what's going on.

469
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.100
And then Travis tells him JP Black Smith was killed in Fallujah last night.

470
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.230
So again,
your point,
is that right?

471
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.253
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.070
<v 0>These are people,
you know,
real close to home</v>

473
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.050
and it was tough for,
for Brian,

474
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.030
it's tough for anyone that's sitting on the sidelines,

475
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.730
which is what you feel like.
You feel like you can't,
you,

476
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.550
you want to help and you can't do anything your bat,

477
00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.120
you're literally thousands of miles away.

478
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.830
And that's what these guys are are feeling.

479
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:54.160
<v 2>Yeah,
a lot.
A lot of frustration there.
But I think also at the same time it,</v>

480
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.920
it built a lot of resolve with those guys.

481
00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.350
I mean they were determined to make sure that they honored them in their service

482
00:32:01.351 --> 00:32:04.930
and work hard to do all they could do to make a difference.

483
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:12.380
<v 0>Now there was a story told in here that I,</v>

484
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.190
I definitely wanted to go over because

485
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.340
<v 1>yeah,</v>

486
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:22.240
<v 0>it revealed a little bit,
um,
uh,
about Travis.</v>

487
00:32:22.241 --> 00:32:27.100
To me that was a little hard to pick up a little earlier and that was obviously

488
00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:31.420
that he was funny as hell and didn't mind taking some risks.

489
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:36.421
So these guys were in a training situation and you know,

490
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:40.730
Travis was on the radio and he's giving commands and he's given orders and

491
00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:45.731
they're being listened to by some higher up training officer that's kind of

492
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.140
monitoring what they're doing.

493
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:52.700
And so Travis is going back and forth on the radio with his guys.

494
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:53.690
They're doing some training.

495
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.550
And then as Travis pressed the button too on his radio to relay the final order,

496
00:32:58.551 --> 00:33:02.330
allowed familiar voice suddenly overtook the frequency.
Lieutenant,

497
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:05.090
this is coyote six the voice said,

498
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.580
I'm not really sure what you're trying to do out here,

499
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.310
but you're not following proper radio procedure.
Sir Travis asked,

500
00:33:12.311 --> 00:33:13.240
puddle puzzled,

501
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.490
you need to figure out what you're trying to do because I sure as hell can't

502
00:33:17.491 --> 00:33:21.510
tell by listening to your orders over to this radio,
the rising voice said,

503
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.990
do things right or do us all a favor and just go home.

504
00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.930
So okay,
Travis,
thanks about that.

505
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.170
And he just keeps his radio and says,
yes sir.

506
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.430
So they're continuing.
They're doing a little bit more.

507
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.730
Travis has continued to direct his troops and his training operation.

508
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.470
And
finally the voice comes on again.

509
00:33:47.471 --> 00:33:49.630
Lieutenant Mannion,
this is [inaudible] six

510
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.740
he said his dozens of eyes rolled.
I have a cold.

511
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.320
I have to ask you a question son.

512
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.500
Do you have any idea what the hell you're doing out there?

513
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:05.210
Radio is dead silent for almost 30 uncomfortable seconds as everyone

514
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:11.490
waited for the young second lieutenants response.
No Sir.

515
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.470
Travis had,
Travis said,

516
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.520
but I did stay at a holiday inn express last night.
No,

517
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.230
for those of you that aren't in the military,
when you key up on the radio,

518
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.950
it's not like I'm just cracking a joke to my boss did just me and him.
No,

519
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.440
there's like dozens and dozens.
If not,
you know,

520
00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:32.460
40 50 maybe even a hundred people that just heard you say that.

521
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:35.790
So that was a ballsy comment.
Funny,

522
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.800
risky,
but kind of showed it's classic.

523
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.980
It's great because that tells the guys,
hey look,
we're going to get through this.

524
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.440
We're going to,
we're going to push it on and we're gonna make this happen.

525
00:34:46.441 --> 00:34:47.620
So I thought that,
yeah,

526
00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:52.890
<v 2>guys from first recon shared that story when they came,
it came to our place.</v>

527
00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:55.380
And it was typical Travis,
you know,

528
00:34:55.381 --> 00:34:57.710
and he said he just like everything got silent,

529
00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.700
the coyote shut up and they said when they got back to the headquarters they

530
00:35:01.701 --> 00:35:03.270
will want it to meet this new lieutenant.

531
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.040
<v 0>You didn't catch me off from,
from quoting six on that code is six got quiet.</v>

532
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.700
That was it.
Yeah.
You got punk so hard.
He just,
he just shut down.

533
00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:16.900
He probably couldn't help but understand that.
Yeah,
that was,
that was brazen.

534
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.600
But that was a good joke.
You know what too.

535
00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.660
I bet if he's a good guy and he's putting pressure on his troops,

536
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.673
he might've just,

537
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.700
so he might've just set back from his radio and just thought to himself,
respect.

538
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:28.660
I respect that.

539
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.510
We've got to respect what words coming out from the Holiday Inn Express

540
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.490
as awesome.
So now we fast forward,

541
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.640
we get to Travis's first deployment and he's in Al Anbar province and with first

542
00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:47.790
recon battalion and here we go as the first reconnaissance battalions,

543
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.840
maintenance management management officer at Camp Fallujah.
His responsibilities,

544
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.080
which were focused on making sure vehicles we're correctly allocated,

545
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:57.660
fueled and repaired.
We're undoubtedly important,

546
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.620
but sitting on the sidelines while others went outside the wire to fight was

547
00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:05.940
definitely not what the marine had envisioned when he was back training.

548
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.660
So he got assigned as a logistics officer?

549
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.810
<v 2>He did,
yeah,
he was,
um,</v>

550
00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:18.340
he actually had intel officers his first choice because they have the sniper

551
00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.250
squads and,
um,
he had infantry for a while and then he said,
you know what,

552
00:36:22.251 --> 00:36:23.740
I think I'd like to work with the sniper.

553
00:36:23.741 --> 00:36:28.000
So he switched it and he always thought since he switched it at the end,

554
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.060
that's how he ended up being a logistician.
So,
so he always,

555
00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:37.130
um,
you know,
was kicking himself for that.
But you know,
when he went out there,

556
00:36:37.131 --> 00:36:40.910
started to work in logistics,
realize how important it was,
the mission,

557
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.500
I think he was still a little frustrated for sure.
But,
um,

558
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:49.580
he started really integrate with first recon and actually Colonel Higgins,

559
00:36:49.581 --> 00:36:53.420
the CEO said,
look,
when you come back from this second tour,

560
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.340
we're going to give you a recap.
Attune.

561
00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.580
So he was pretty jazzed up about that and looking forward to,

562
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.990
to getting a recon batoon and uh,
you know,

563
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:07.010
it was part of why when he was over there as a Mitt team member,

564
00:37:07.011 --> 00:37:11.850
he was doing logistics as an advisor,
but also he was also taken the,

565
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.190
the platoons out on patrols probably more than anyone over there.
I mean,

566
00:37:16.191 --> 00:37:19.550
he was that sort of the way he was.
I mean,
he was going to get ready,

567
00:37:19.551 --> 00:37:21.890
so he was like,
okay,
another patrol.
I'm going,

568
00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.040
<v 0>yeah,
I got it.
It's a,
I mean,</v>

569
00:37:25.041 --> 00:37:27.590
obviously logistics wins wars.

570
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.633
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

571
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.300
<v 0>That being said,
I don't think Travis was the logistics kind of guy.</v>

572
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:37.290
And in logistics they truly do.
I mean,
if you can't get bullets and beans,

573
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:39.060
you're not going to win the war.
That's the way it is.

574
00:37:39.061 --> 00:37:40.720
And that's one of the great things about the Marine Corps,

575
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:44.760
the way they do their spread and they put really high quality guys in every

576
00:37:44.761 --> 00:37:48.690
aspect of marine corps,
including logistics.
But yeah,
I can imagine he was,

577
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.060
he was a pretty frustrated about that.

578
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.150
<v 2>Well,
frustrated.</v>

579
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:58.250
And now the Marine Corps gives then an annual award to the logistician of the

580
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.340
year and it's the Travis Manion logistician of the year.

581
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:08.590
<v 0>Okay.
That's all.
That's awesome.
You know,
and,</v>

582
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:12.140
and Sherat Sharat cause that how you pronounce his name.
No,
share it,
share it.

583
00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.150
Share.
So share it.

584
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:18.590
I thought this was another awesome piece of advice from,
from Sharon.

585
00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.480
You know,
who,
you know,
Travis had reached out and said,
hey,
you know,
it's,

586
00:38:22.481 --> 00:38:24.470
it's great to be here.
I'm doing the best I can,
you know,

587
00:38:24.471 --> 00:38:25.570
but I'm definitely getting frustrated.

588
00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.950
I want to go outside the wire and share it says

589
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.000
learn everything you can.

590
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:34.870
Every second you can study the tactics,
study the,

591
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:39.700
study the culture and know them more importantly,

592
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.770
know yourself and be vigilant not to let up on yourself.

593
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.620
Preparing for the unexpected.
So that's just incredible advice.
You don't know.

594
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.240
And,
and it doesn't matter what situation you were in,

595
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.500
you try and make yourself better and you want to actually,
I worked for,

596
00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.730
for one of the senior seal admirals that when September 11th kicked off,

597
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:05.850
he was in charge of acquisitions at the Pentagon as a,

598
00:39:06.851 --> 00:39:09.910
as a captain.
And you,
you know,

599
00:39:09.911 --> 00:39:14.290
here's everyone going to war and he's,
you know,
doing acquisitions,

600
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:15.700
which for those of you that aren't military,

601
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:19.510
that means it's high level logistics.
And,
and,

602
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:22.390
and something that he told me that always stuck with me was,
you know,

603
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:25.990
he was the same thing as,
as,
as Travis.
And he's frustrated.
He,
Oh,

604
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:29.770
here I am in the Pentagon every day.
And what he told me was,

605
00:39:29.771 --> 00:39:33.070
you know what I said to myself,
Jocko,
this is my foxhole.
I'm gonna fight,

606
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.220
you know,
so his foxhole wasn't the Pentagon dealing with paper,

607
00:39:36.221 --> 00:39:39.730
and that's what he did.
And he knew that he,
that was his,

608
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:40.630
that was what he had to do.

609
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.090
And now he's going to do it to the best of his ability.
And,

610
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:47.270
and hearing this from Sharat Sharat share it,
share it.
I'm going to keep it.
Yeah,

611
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.510
well Joe was a great mentor.
You know,

612
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.800
he always had solid advice for Travis and the other guys that wrestled at navy

613
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:54.634
for sure.

614
00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.960
All this being said about,
you know,

615
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.700
logistics being inside the wire.
Oh,
logistics.

616
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.660
When you're running convoys all the time.
Those logistics guys,
Army,
Marine Corps,

617
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.170
Navy Seabees,
we had cvs that ran logistics.

618
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.310
You're doing convoys and you're doing convoys do down heavily laden IED streets.

619
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.640
So there was all kinds of logistics.
As a matter of fact,
you know the,

620
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:24.900
there's a lot of female logisticians that deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Oh,

621
00:40:24.901 --> 00:40:28.130
they're supposed to be in a non combat role.
Well guess what they got after it?

622
00:40:28.131 --> 00:40:31.140
They had to the right in the middle of it all.
You're in a convoy.
Yeah.

623
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.210
So speaking of that,
back to the book,

624
00:40:33.211 --> 00:40:36.450
during one late night evening convoy through Fallujah,

625
00:40:36.451 --> 00:40:40.260
the deafening thunder of an IED shattered the relative tranquility of first

626
00:40:40.261 --> 00:40:43.530
reconnaissance battalion patrol.
The group of marines had been attacked before,

627
00:40:43.531 --> 00:40:47.070
but this was the first time that Travis was with them during a hostel incident,

628
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.450
keeping his composure while following orders of the more experienced officers.

629
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:52.583
Travis,

630
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:57.000
his heart pumping and ears ringing helped evacuate a marine who was wounded in

631
00:40:57.001 --> 00:41:01.860
the attack.
So again,

632
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.890
might've been in logistics,
but you're still,

633
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.160
those guys are out there right in the middle of it.
Yeah,
exactly.

634
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.130
Now he comes home from that deployment.
I'm going back to the book.

635
00:41:14.131 --> 00:41:19.131
Iraq changed newly promoted First Lieutenant Travis Mannion for the better as

636
00:41:19.951 --> 00:41:23.970
the Marines,
mom,
dad,
sister,
and several naval academies,

637
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.400
buddies all noticed he was still the same.

638
00:41:26.401 --> 00:41:29.790
Travis who had willingly traded Doyle's town for one of the world's most

639
00:41:29.791 --> 00:41:34.520
dangerous places.
But after returning to the United,

640
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.080
Travis carried with him at an aura of seriousness and quiet self confidence that

641
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:42.230
was unfamiliar to some of his closest friends and loved ones.

642
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:47.330
When Travis talked about life,
he acknowledged its fragility.

643
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:52.100
Having felt the pulse of an IED blast and seeing dead bodies in the streets

644
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:57.280
for a young marine who had just spent eight months in Fallujah,

645
00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:02.790
it was almost impossible not to mature no matter what Travis was doing.

646
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:07.440
He was acutely aware that every single day Americans,

647
00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:11.700
Iraqis and Afghans were fighting and often dying.

648
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:22.650
I love the fact that that paragraph starts off by saying that that deployment to

649
00:42:23.651 --> 00:42:28.270
Iraq change Travis for the better because so often w you know,

650
00:42:28.271 --> 00:42:33.271
we here and civilians get told and the public gets told that the war does all

651
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.170
these horrible things to people and,

652
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:41.050
and they fail to realize that in many cases,
war makes you a better person.

653
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.710
<v 2>Well,
you could,
you could definitely see the difference with Travis.
I mean,
he,</v>

654
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.670
he went over there and eight months later he was a different guy.
I mean,

655
00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:54.650
he was so much more focused and mature and,
and you know,

656
00:42:54.651 --> 00:42:59.060
he had a chance to lead over there in these incredible situations where you have

657
00:42:59.061 --> 00:43:02.840
to make quick decisions.
And,
you know,
he,
uh,

658
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:07.680
he got a lot from it.
I could just sort of see it in the time I spent with him.

659
00:43:07.681 --> 00:43:11.270
And He,
and the other thing about it,
I think is like appreciating what you have.

660
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:14.750
I mean,
to saw that so much from him,
you know,
when he was back here,

661
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:18.530
was just like,
wow,
this is the greatest place in the world.
You know,

662
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.300
<v 0>there's no,
no doubt about that.</v>

663
00:43:21.301 --> 00:43:25.530
That's something I think everybody that deploys comes back and you add a
minimum,

664
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:30.840
you're going to appreciate what we have in America.
Things like bathrooms.

665
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:36.210
Yeah.
Because over there you're,
you're only in a Porta potties,
right?

666
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.790
Or you're in the field,
but you're in Porta potties.

667
00:43:38.791 --> 00:43:42.930
In the summertime we used to call them the Blue Saunas beat because they're blue

668
00:43:42.931 --> 00:43:46.530
colored plastic.
Right.
And then inside it's,
you know,

669
00:43:46.531 --> 00:43:50.680
it's 120 degrees outside.
So inside the Blue Sauna,
Eh,

670
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.620
it's,
you know,

671
00:43:52.621 --> 00:43:57.240
160 degrees and you don't want to leave the doors open because that's just

672
00:43:57.241 --> 00:44:01.400
nasty.
So you just leave the blue sauna shut.
Yeah.

673
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.720
Do when you come home from that?
Yeah.

674
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:06.250
You get to a protector appreciate off thing.

675
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.520
And a meanwhile,
this time Brendan,

676
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:16.950
he now has gone to on a deployment to South Korea,

677
00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.060
working as an Intel officer and doing that in,
in,

678
00:44:21.061 --> 00:44:25.490
even in doing that,
he felt like he had,
you know,

679
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:30.960
a lot more to do.
And this is when he focused on,
you know,
he wanted to be a seal.

680
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.300
Now he's going,
yes,
I need to be a seal.

681
00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:38.340
He told his girlfriend who he had met while they were going to the naval
academy.

682
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:41.370
Amy,
Amy,
I've got to do more.

683
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.540
Brendan said during a late night phone conversation,
Travis is there,

684
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:48.120
my other buddies are there and I want to be there with them.

685
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:54.020
When Amy reminded him of the dangers,
his friends like Travis,
we're facing,

686
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:59.270
Brendan was undeterred,
I should be in the fight.
He insisted.

687
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.310
Now there's an issue here and actually I,
I was,
I talked about this,

688
00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:08.690
how surprising it was that Brendan didn't get picked up for the seals out of the

689
00:45:08.691 --> 00:45:11.000
naval academy and I,
and I forgot the reason.

690
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.750
If there's a really distinct reason called him,
he was colorblind,

691
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.190
he was colorblind and you can't be colorblind in the seal teams.

692
00:45:19.191 --> 00:45:21.470
At least you're not.
He's the first guy to get a waiver.

693
00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.360
You're not supposed to be colorblind in the seal teams and that's why he didn't

694
00:45:26.361 --> 00:45:27.194
get picked up.

695
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:31.750
<v 2>I still remember that call from Travis.
He said,
dad got great news.</v>

696
00:45:31.751 --> 00:45:33.790
Brandon just got selected for the seals.

697
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.370
Navy seals just got one hell of a leader.

698
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:41.120
<v 0>Yeah,
that's awesome.
And before he got picked up,</v>

699
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:44.840
and this is probably helped him in back to the book in August,

700
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.690
2006 Brendan deployed to Fallujah where he gathered,

701
00:45:47.691 --> 00:45:49.820
analyzed intelligence for combat missions,

702
00:45:49.821 --> 00:45:52.520
including operations carried out by seals.

703
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.940
So actually I was in Ramadi at this time,
so Rwandese,
I dunno,

704
00:45:55.941 --> 00:45:59.390
40 30 miles from Fallujah and he,
he was working,

705
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.200
he must have been working at our intel shop.

706
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.800
And so the Intel he was gathering,

707
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:11.450
we would go out and prosecute those targets and he's working with working with

708
00:46:11.451 --> 00:46:16.210
seals and that that must have helped them out
back to the book.
Meanwhile,

709
00:46:16.211 --> 00:46:19.990
Travis was making another visit to the east coast for the Christening of his

710
00:46:19.991 --> 00:46:23.880
niece,
Maggie rose [inaudible] give her,
so,

711
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.130
so he's Christian,
his daughter.

712
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:32.190
And also he found out now that he's going back to Iraq and that this is another

713
00:46:34.631 --> 00:46:36.760
thing that he's sharing that news as the,
as,

714
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.020
as your granddaughter's getting christened,
Travis is telling you,
Hey,

715
00:46:41.021 --> 00:46:44.590
I'm going back to Iraq and he's going back with the,

716
00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.670
with the,
what is it?
The third battalion,
Second Brigade,

717
00:46:48.671 --> 00:46:52.240
first Iraqi army division,
military transition team,
Mitt team.

718
00:46:52.241 --> 00:46:55.930
I said that in the opening,
so little,

719
00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.430
little bit about the Mitt teams.

720
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.200
I've talked about the various levels of comfort that you have in the military or

721
00:47:05.171 --> 00:47:10.171
that we had in Iraq and and how you know us guys in the seal teams generally for

722
00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:14.020
the most part,
high level of comfort,
you know,

723
00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.580
we would get to a place we would bring,
we would build a gym immediately.

724
00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:22.210
We would have our CBS constructed Jim.
If we didn't have one,
we would get,

725
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:27.460
you know,
we would get video or Internet service,
we would live pretty good,

726
00:47:27.461 --> 00:47:31.870
we'd get food shipped and we would pretty good.
Now that being said,

727
00:47:31.871 --> 00:47:34.780
of course there was special ops guys that are way out in the middle of nowhere

728
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:38.470
living on a farm somewhere and that's living rough.

729
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.440
There were some people that were even more comfortable.

730
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.400
There were some headquarters units that had swimming pools,

731
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.940
and we'll say that again as swimming pools.
So there's some headquarters areas,

732
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:55.260
you know,
if you got into the Green Zone in Baghdad,
you're,
yeah,

733
00:47:55.261 --> 00:47:56.350
I'm on deployment in Iraq.

734
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.780
I'm going to hand out to the swimming pool for a few minutes.
And you know,

735
00:47:58.781 --> 00:48:02.080
there's,
there's those,
there's those kind of living,
and then you get,
you know,

736
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:03.370
you got in Ramadi,

737
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:08.371
we had the conventional guys that were living in the combat outpost in the city,

738
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:09.880
real rough living.

739
00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:15.780
And then you go one step refer and where you end up with his mid teams and Mitt

740
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:20.230
teams.
So this,
the,
the stands for military transition team,

741
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.760
and this is when you are the direct advisor to an Iraqi battalion.

742
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.590
And in this case it was the three,
two one.

743
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:36.070
You're gonna hear me say that a bunch of the third battalion,
Second Brigade,

744
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.880
first Iraqi army division.
So this is,

745
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:44.940
this is a battalion of Iraqi soldiers supposed to be six or 700,

746
00:48:45.161 --> 00:48:48.400
probably a lot less than that because they were generally highly undermanned.

747
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.120
But the Mitt teams had a really,
really hard job.

748
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.900
Oh re an incredibly hard job.
It was,
you know,

749
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:59.680
we did advising to the Iraqi soldiers and we work with the Iraqi soldiers side

750
00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:04.681
by side and these guys did it not just on the battlefield but with everything

751
00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:07.390
that they did.
Helping them with their pay,
helping them learn how to,

752
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.420
how to do the logistics side that you mentioned.
Travis,

753
00:49:10.421 --> 00:49:14.840
who's doing the Mitt teams.
Just nothing but respect for the met team has.

754
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.260
And on top of that we go out with the seal teams.
You know,

755
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:21.760
we had great training and then we had other seals with us.
Mint tea we'd have,

756
00:49:21.761 --> 00:49:24.520
we'd have a minimum,
usually have like six to eight seals with us.

757
00:49:24.521 --> 00:49:25.500
When we go mid teams.

758
00:49:25.501 --> 00:49:30.190
Sometimes those guys are going out with one other Mitt team guy out with 40

759
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:34.210
Iraqi soldiers.
Poorly trained,
poorly motivated.

760
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:39.860
<v 2>Yeah.
They lived right there with them and they were totally embedded with them.</v>

761
00:49:39.861 --> 00:49:43.730
So eating the same food,
tough job.
A horse.

762
00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.890
I remember that.
The uh,

763
00:49:45.891 --> 00:49:50.300
the call from Travis when it first heard that and I was just like,
wow,
you know,

764
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.440
much more comfortable as a dad with Travis with 200 marines.
Yeah.

765
00:49:54.441 --> 00:49:57.200
The comfort level.
The comfort levels in comparable.
Yeah.

766
00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:01.260
<v 0>Between being with 200 marines and being with 200 Iraqis,</v>

767
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.890
it's these completely,
it's that the level of risk is so much higher.

768
00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:06.510
There was a win.

769
00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:11.690
There was a Mitt team that came out in Ramadi and they were turning over to Mitt

770
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:15.270
team,
the ongoing milliliter leader and the offgoing meant leader returned over.

771
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:17.970
They got attacked.
Both of them got killed.
One attack.

772
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.020
That's how much risk that you're taking with these these Mitt teams situations.

773
00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:24.900
<v 2>Well,
the other thing about these guys is,
you know they were,</v>

774
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:27.060
they were gone out in,

775
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:31.910
in patrols with them and you know if they're going to train them the right way,

776
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:35.180
they were out front.
They,
one of the things we've,
Travis,

777
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:38.480
last time I talked to him,
one of the last times at home,
I said,
Travis,

778
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.980
you're an advisor.

779
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.660
Make sure you just told the Iraqis were it needs to be done and step back and

780
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:48.620
let them execute.
And he was like,
Okay Dad,
I got it.
And I knew,

781
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:51.620
I knew exactly,
you know what he was going to do.

782
00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:54.650
He's going to lead from the front and that,
that's what he did.
You know,

783
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:58.130
that's what all those guys were doing.
They were,
you're,
you're out of patrol.

784
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.130
You're right out front with everyone else.
You know,
when the Navy Seals,
uh,

785
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.850
came back,
uh,
Eric Greitens was a navy seal with Travis and he said,
you know,

786
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:12.020
Travis was always there,
every patrol.
So

787
00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.073
<v 4>yeah,</v>

788
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:20.440
<v 0>so that's where he gets tasked with and it,</v>

789
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:24.690
and I'll tell you what,
if you want to get some here in the Mitt team,
you know,

790
00:51:24.691 --> 00:51:25.680
like you said,
you know,

791
00:51:25.681 --> 00:51:27.270
you're going to go out in patrols of the rack as you know,

792
00:51:27.271 --> 00:51:28.890
you're going to get after it.
There's no doubt about it.

793
00:51:28.891 --> 00:51:32.670
So nothing but respect for the guys that we worked with a bunch of Mitt teams in

794
00:51:32.671 --> 00:51:37.440
Ramadi,
just outstanding guys doing a really,
really hard job.

795
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:39.330
Tough,
tough,
unrelenting job.

796
00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.690
<v 2>Well,
you know,
at the end of the day with strategically,
it was the search,
right?</v>

797
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:47.490
And they put everything behind the mid teams at that point.

798
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:52.000
You remember in 2006 2007 before Travis left,

799
00:51:52.001 --> 00:51:55.600
he actually had a chance to talk to General Maddis came and talked to his Mitt

800
00:51:55.601 --> 00:51:58.060
team,
but how important that mission was.

801
00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:03.280
So we're putting a lot behind our guys that were embedded with the Iraqis.

802
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:04.710
<v 0>Yeah.
And again for those of you that,</v>

803
00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.380
just to dig into that strategic piece a little bit more,

804
00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:13.220
our goal was to turnover Iraqi security to the Iraqis and,

805
00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:15.630
and the only way to do that,

806
00:52:15.631 --> 00:52:18.600
and we realize this and that's one of the things that made people realize the

807
00:52:18.601 --> 00:52:21.840
importance of the Mitt teams was you weren't going to do it.

808
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:25.530
You want to cut to educate them on how to do a combat patrol in the classroom.

809
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.740
You weren't going to educate them on how to do a combat patrol.

810
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.720
Even on a training field.

811
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:35.780
You needed to take them out and teach them and force them to go out and do these

812
00:52:37.741 --> 00:52:41.410
things.
Cause the Iraqi's,
if they have the,
the,
the,

813
00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:46.020
the had the opportunity to either stay on base or go out on patrol.

814
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.310
A lot of them would do it.
Yeah.
There,
their goal is to stay on base.
Many of them,

815
00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.330
many.
And so of course there were some guys that were more motivated,

816
00:52:54.331 --> 00:52:57.120
but a lot of them were just,
they just want to survive,
right?

817
00:52:57.121 --> 00:52:57.990
They just want to survive.

818
00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:03.000
So strategically that's what we had to do was we had to take them out and give

819
00:53:03.001 --> 00:53:07.440
them on the job training and simultaneously pushed them to,

820
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.670
to go out and try and lower some of the level of violence out in the various

821
00:53:11.671 --> 00:53:16.280
cities.
So,
hey,
at this time also,

822
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:21.230
as you mentioned,
uh,
Brendan got approved for his,

823
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.320
for his lat transfers called Allat transference or now he knows that he's going

824
00:53:25.321 --> 00:53:30.120
to,
he knows that he's going to go to buds,

825
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:33.690
go to buds and,
and,
and be a seal or at least try and be a CEO.

826
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:37.210
But I bet he was pretty confident.
I'm certain of that.

827
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:43.710
One of the first things Travis did here,
he's,
he's going,

828
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.450
he's got a couple more days left.

829
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:50.780
He meets up with Marine Major Steve Cantrell and assistant navy wrestling coach

830
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:53.100
and they go to New York,

831
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.780
Travis and Cantrell decide to spend a few days in New York City where Cantrell

832
00:53:57.781 --> 00:54:02.550
at arranged a visit to New York fire departments rescue one headquarters located

833
00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:07.290
in Hell's kitchen rescue one had become a revered place over the past five
years.

834
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.520
A small Manhattan building,
which was still fully functioning,

835
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.640
had been the home base for 11 firefighters,

836
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.440
almost half the unit who were killed in the September 11th,

837
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.920
2001 terrorist attacks as they were leaving the firehouse.

838
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.160
One firefighter and former marine,
thank Travis for coming out.

839
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.263
Lieutenant Mannion,

840
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.800
I want you to have these hats and shirts said the Marine Corps vet veteran,

841
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.830
no matter how crazy things get over there,

842
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:40.170
you can always put one of these on and remember what you're fighting for.

843
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:46.020
Then he comes home and he's got that,

844
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.840
that rescue one hat with the,

845
00:54:48.841 --> 00:54:51.930
with the rescue one fire department,

846
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:56.700
New York logo on the front and nine 1101 never forget on the back.

847
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.120
And he says to you,
Dad,

848
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.450
I want you to have this and please wear it while I'm gone.

849
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:07.140
No matter what happens,
always remember that this is what we're fighting for.

850
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:12.380
<v 2>Yeah.
I always remember that,
that discussion we had,
you know,</v>

851
00:55:12.381 --> 00:55:17.230
down the hallway and so impacted him to be there with those guys.

852
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.560
And he actually went up there to,
to thank them for all they had done.

853
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.040
And he said,
dad,
they couldn't thank me enough for,

854
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:29.020
for my tour and what I was about to do.
And,
and he was,

855
00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:29.680
you know,
he,

856
00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.430
he got real serious about it and always remember that was one of the last

857
00:55:33.431 --> 00:55:38.140
conversations I had with him.
An interesting side note to that story.

858
00:55:38.141 --> 00:55:41.200
So my wife and I,
after we lost Travis,

859
00:55:41.201 --> 00:55:43.840
went up to rescue one talk to the guys.

860
00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:48.880
We were up there and they sort of remember maybe you know somebody coming

861
00:55:49.181 --> 00:55:50.014
through and,

862
00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:54.250
but it never really clicked for the guys who are with but great guys.

863
00:55:54.251 --> 00:55:54.641
And you know,

864
00:55:54.641 --> 00:55:59.641
we ended up leaving and never felt like we had the connection that we expected

865
00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:04.660
because Travis had talked about it's so much and a couple of years later,

866
00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:07.780
I'd say about
two years ago.

867
00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:12.430
So what are you talking about?
Like seven,
six,
seven years later.

868
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:17.200
Well the books out and there's a New York City firefighter that gives his buddy

869
00:56:17.201 --> 00:56:21.160
the book and says,
Hey read this book,
sit mentions rescue one.

870
00:56:21.161 --> 00:56:24.970
So the guys on the treadmill,
he almost off the tram.
I says that that was me.

871
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:26.560
He had since been transfer.

872
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:30.880
So Tim Sullivan calls me up and says I'm the guy in the book.

873
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.400
I want to come have a beer with you.
Yeah

874
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:37.623
<v 0>that's outstanding.</v>

875
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:42.830
And that's also the same conversation where you told Travis,
you know,

876
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:47.620
hey you're an advisor
advise.
Right.
Then let the,

877
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:51.050
let the Iraqi's execute,
which can be really hard.
It's,
you know,

878
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:53.680
can be hard cause they won't execute.

879
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.940
It can be hard cause you want to show them how to do it right and and oftentimes

880
00:56:57.941 --> 00:57:01.630
if you don't lead from the front,
not going to happen is how can I have in there?

881
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:06.490
No.
So
now

882
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:08.741
your son in law,

883
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:13.741
Dave and Travis go to a football game and here we go back to the book as they

884
00:57:16.451 --> 00:57:19.270
reach a flight of stairs near the Lincoln financial field.

885
00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:23.710
Exit Dave with a clear hint of humor.
Finally conveyed is concerned.

886
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:27.670
He was concerned,
you know,
he's concerned about and going overseas and he says,

887
00:57:27.671 --> 00:57:30.370
Hey Travis,
if I tripped you right now,
when you fell down and broke your ankle,

888
00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:34.030
do you think they'd let you sit this deployment out?
He asked.

889
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.750
Travis chuckled at Dave's joke,
but didn't say much in response,

890
00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:44.050
a brief moment of slightly awkward silence followed while drunk and eagles fans

891
00:57:44.051 --> 00:57:48.280
shouted and chanted all around them.
Suddenly Travis spoke up.

892
00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:53.120
You know what though,
Dave Travis said,

893
00:57:53.121 --> 00:57:56.810
we've an unmistakably serious look on his face.
If I don't go,

894
00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:00.920
they're going to send another marine in my place who doesn't have my training,

895
00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.430
if not me,
then who?

896
00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:06.713
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

897
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:12.060
<v 0>He continued.
It's either me or that other guy who isn't ready.</v>

898
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:15.240
So I'm the one who has to get the job done.

899
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:20.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

900
00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.560
<v 2>So think about that because you know,
you think back to the,</v>

901
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:28.930
the time with coach Sharon and Brian Stan and then they're in the plane and

902
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:32.760
Travis has,
I want to be known as the guy that always,
you know,

903
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:35.410
stepped forward and did what was right,
if not me,

904
00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:37.960
than who is another way to say it,
right?

905
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:39.500
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

906
00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:45.340
<v 2>And it's,
you know,
it's not,
I don't share that because it's unique to Travis,</v>

907
00:58:45.341 --> 00:58:47.470
you know,
I share that because it's an,

908
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:51.910
and this whole story is really a representation is so many men and women in

909
00:58:51.911 --> 00:58:53.650
uniform,
you know,
it's their story,

910
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:58.450
but it's a story that can be told about so many and that,

911
00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:01.570
if not me,
then who,
you know,
we,
we,

912
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:06.310
we use that now at the foundation is sort of drive momentum around,

913
00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:06.881
you know,

914
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:10.660
what we all need to be thinking about as Americans stepping up and doing the

915
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:11.494
right thing.

916
00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:17.080
<v 0>I'll agree with you 100% that there's a lot of people that say things like that.</v>

917
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:22.080
But you know,
to have an example that someone that's so clearly live that is,

918
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:24.050
is awesome to look at.

919
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.753
<v 1>Okay,</v>

920
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.950
<v 0>now we're getting ready for deployment.
Back to the book,</v>

921
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.970
more than a hundred American troops were killed in Iraq and December,

922
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.460
2006 including Major Meghan Mcclung,

923
00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:43.360
the highest ranking female officer to die in Iraq war and the Iraq war and the

924
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:47.930
first female Navy Naval Academy graduate to be killed in combat.

925
00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:52.830
And
by the way,
that she was stationed in Ramadi,

926
00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:58.070
I knew her and she was killed along with a another army specialist named Vincent

927
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.560
Permante.
They're killed by big ID on routes sunset,
I think it was.

928
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.140
And also another guy was with her,
a guy named Travis Patrick Quinn,

929
01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.310
who was just an unbelievable guy.

930
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.270
And this was a huge loss to lose,

931
01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.210
to lose Travis and,
and Megan and in that IED,

932
01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.470
right,
I knew both of them and it was just,
just a huge loss.

933
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:37.540
<v 2>Never,
never knew her,
but I certainly met her parents,
you know?
Yeah,</v>

934
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.410
she's buried down in Arlington section 60 she

935
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.413
<v 0>was,</v>

936
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.430
she was just like really just a huge smile all the time.

937
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.750
Are Real go getter,
just making things happen in anyway.
I didn't work with her.

938
01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:51.840
Well you know,
I mean we'd see,

939
01:00:51.841 --> 01:00:53.890
I see you're at brigade meetings cause we were both,
you know,

940
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:58.020
working with the one,
one a d and you know,
she was just,
yeah,
I got that.

941
01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.200
And she was just really positive and,
and she was,

942
01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.010
the thing I remember most about her was just her smiling,
you know,

943
01:01:05.011 --> 01:01:09.000
she just had always had a big smile on her face and,
and,
and Travis,

944
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:13.170
you know what I'm going to do Travis story on here someday.
You know,

945
01:01:13.171 --> 01:01:15.360
Travis was the guy,
he made this,

946
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.750
this PowerPoint brief for how to win the war in Iraq.

947
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.560
And it was a stick figures and it explained like,
Hey,
here's you,

948
01:01:22.561 --> 01:01:23.221
you're an American,

949
01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:27.360
here's this Iraqi and you don't know if this Iraqi is good or bad,
but you know,

950
01:01:27.361 --> 01:01:29.160
who does know these other Iraqis?

951
01:01:29.161 --> 01:01:31.830
And it was just all these stick figures and it's,
it got published,

952
01:01:31.831 --> 01:01:35.430
it got circulated.
That was Travis.
That was Travis Patrick when he spoke Arabic.

953
01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:38.850
Uh,
just a fantastic guy and I'll definitely cover,
there's,

954
01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:43.860
there was a book written about him as well,
so,
hmm.
Incredible people

955
01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:45.123
<v 2>on,
um,</v>

956
01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.160
on her at her grave site in section 60.
It says,
be bold,

957
01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:52.480
be brief,
be gone.

958
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.180
<v 0>Well she,
well she was indeed all those three things</v>

959
01:01:58.850 --> 01:01:59.683
going on here.

960
01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.020
Now Major Doug's and Beck,

961
01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:07.800
the Naval Academy wrestler turned warrior whom Travis admired.

962
01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:14.350
<v 2>He was killed as well.
Yeah,
it was,
um,</v>

963
01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:17.310
shortly after we lost Travis,
a couple of weeks later,

964
01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:21.450
Doug was over there in Baghdad.
Was killed.
Yeah.

965
01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.520
Okay.
He was,
he,
I don't know if you knew him.
I didn't,

966
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.350
I just kind of a big personality at the Naval Academy and had the marines in

967
01:02:33.351 --> 01:02:38.060
Fallujah.
Yeah.
Came back Felicia and yeah.

968
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:39.770
Yeah.
Quite quite a leader in that.

969
01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:44.090
I really didn't know me there in Travis his junior year,

970
01:02:44.091 --> 01:02:48.590
he was back wrestling with Travis at navy.
They were about the same size.

971
01:02:48.591 --> 01:02:50.610
Doug was a big guy and,
and uh,

972
01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.120
see a guy behind the bench yelling and screaming like crazy as trousers out

973
01:02:56.121 --> 01:02:58.490
there.
Wrestling had a really tough match.

974
01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:03.680
He ends up winning like one nothing against this kid from North Carolina.
I said,

975
01:03:03.681 --> 01:03:07.640
Travis,
who is that guy behind the bench?
He said,
dad,
that's Doug's Inback back.

976
01:03:07.641 --> 01:03:09.020
You don't who Doug's him back case.

977
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.780
So that's when I first met Scott at this point.

978
01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:15.310
<v 0>He hadn't been killed yet.
He was,
he was,</v>

979
01:03:15.311 --> 01:03:17.360
but the point that they were making here that I,

980
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.480
I kind of miss worded was that he was a classmate of,

981
01:03:23.501 --> 01:03:27.340
uh,
of Megan macunx apparently.
Yeah.
Classmates.

982
01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.110
And so that was the connection there.
Yeah,

983
01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:36.390
that was a couple.
That was what,
a couple of weeks,
couple of weeks before before,

984
01:03:36.391 --> 01:03:40.320
uh,
Travis arrives that,
you know,
he's getting this news.
Yeah.

985
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:46.620
Now Travis is back in Fallujah.
Back to the book.

986
01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:50.100
Travis has seen his share of blood but never needed a wash any from his hands.

987
01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:53.560
That all changed in change in January,
less than a month after returned,

988
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.040
returned to Falucia for a second deployment.

989
01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.560
Travis and his fellow members went on combat patrols virtually every day,

990
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:09.490
sometimes running as many as three missions over a punishing 18 hour span in

991
01:04:09.951 --> 01:04:13.100
collusion throughout Iraq,
marine soldiers,
sailors,
airmen,

992
01:04:13.101 --> 01:04:17.360
and Iraqi troops did everything from hunting and surgeons and weapons caches to

993
01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:21.950
disposing of dead bodies.
Adding to three,
two,
one myths,
Challenges.

994
01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:25.580
We're joint patrols with the Iraqis through some of Falucia is most dangerous

995
01:04:25.581 --> 01:04:26.414
sectors.

996
01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.380
The Iraqi soldiers would sometimes respond to the slightest sign of violence

997
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:35.120
with what some u s team members nicknamed the Iraqi death blossom.

998
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.730
When a shot was fired in their direction,

999
01:04:37.731 --> 01:04:41.090
the Iraqis would sometimes form a circle and fire in every direction with little

1000
01:04:41.091 --> 01:04:42.380
regard for consequences,

1001
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:46.100
including tragically catching innocent civilians in a crossfire.

1002
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:51.740
Civilian casualties were sometimes unavoidable,
unavoidable reality of war,

1003
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.700
but Travis and his fellow marines were determined to use every means at their

1004
01:04:55.701 --> 01:04:57.260
disposal to prevent them.

1005
01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.660
While some Mitt team members understand that,

1006
01:05:02.661 --> 01:05:07.580
we became frustrated with the often untrained,
underpaid Iraqi soldiers.

1007
01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.200
Travis positioned himself as a mentor during lunch.

1008
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.400
He would bring his child or that to their mess hall and sit with Nick and Iraqi

1009
01:05:16.401 --> 01:05:19.990
translator who helped bridge the gap between us and Iraqi armies.

1010
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.800
They not only talked about combat strategy,

1011
01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:26.950
but also simple things like soccer.

1012
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.650
So this is just pure professionalism.
That's what that is.
Pure profession.

1013
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:37.500
<v 2>I had a chance to go over to Iraq in 2010 and I met with the Iraqis at Travis</v>

1014
01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:40.740
serve with and they said that,
you know,

1015
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:46.020
Lieutenant Man I knew would always come over and sit down and eat with us and

1016
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:50.700
talk with us.
And he always part of what you needed to do,
right?
If you're gonna,

1017
01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.820
if you're going to be there and be their brother and,

1018
01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.280
and help them with the mission they had,

1019
01:05:56.281 --> 01:06:00.150
you got to be part of what they're doing.
And he understood that.
And I mean,
it's

1020
01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.920
not like a unlike Brendan would,
you know what I mean?

1021
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:09.300
When you're playing athletics,
you sorta get that teamwork piece,
you know,

1022
01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:12.300
you know if you're going to make it work,
you got to all be together.

1023
01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.003
<v 0>Yeah.
And it's,</v>

1024
01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:19.870
the book makes it sound like it's fairly easy to do that.
It's not,
man,

1025
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:24.690
it's hard.
There's a huge cultural difference between Iraqis in American and,

1026
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.570
and you know,
it's not that big of a deal,

1027
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:32.520
but I'll tell you what going,
you know,
you're,
you're overseas.

1028
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.670
The one time you can kind of relax is when you get to sit down and eat your

1029
01:06:35.671 --> 01:06:39.000
child and you're in the Chow Hall and you're actually fairly well protected.

1030
01:06:39.001 --> 01:06:42.110
Most of the time.
You don't have to worry about anything.
You,

1031
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.670
you clear your weapon before you go in the Chow Hall.
I mean it's,

1032
01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.630
it's usually a relatively safe place and you get to relax and get to be around

1033
01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:53.070
all your American friends and it's good to,
to deny yourself that.

1034
01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:56.400
And now you're going into,
because you know,
at this time you don't,

1035
01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.080
you can't give full trust to the Iraqi's.
You're,
you're gonna,
you know,

1036
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:04.320
eating with them the conversations or stilted,

1037
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.720
it's just not this little thing.
It's a big deal.
It's a,
it's a,

1038
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.730
it's a big deal to make that extra effort.
And,
and clearly you how many times,

1039
01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.860
you know,
I'm,
I'm pretty engaged in my job.

1040
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.400
Do you have any times I ate with Iraqis when I was in Iraq on my last
deployment?

1041
01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:24.150
Oh Man.
Maybe twice,

1042
01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:29.790
maybe twice,
maybe twice.
You know,

1043
01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:33.270
because you know,
when I was in a little bit,
I was in a different position,

1044
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.520
but maybe twice.

1045
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.860
<v 2>Yeah.
And you know,
at the end of the day they recognize that,
oh,
for sure.</v>

1046
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.910
When I went over,

1047
01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:44.260
they talked about that quite a bit with me and how they'd recognize that now it

1048
01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:46.630
was important to them and he knew that

1049
01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:49.890
<v 0>he absolutely did.
That's the point is that he,
he knew it.</v>

1050
01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.580
He knew that making that sacrifice,
building those relationships,

1051
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.430
that was his primary mission,

1052
01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.030
or at least one of his primary missions was to build relationships with these

1053
01:08:00.031 --> 01:08:03.810
Iraqi soldiers so that they could get to know him so they could build trust

1054
01:08:03.811 --> 01:08:06.330
until that they would go out there and do their job.

1055
01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.270
So professional at all times.

1056
01:08:09.271 --> 01:08:14.271
And this is another really good example of of traves Travis's leadership back to

1057
01:08:14.371 --> 01:08:15.204
the book.

1058
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:19.190
Just as some US marines became frustrated by the raw battlefield tactics of the

1059
01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:22.580
Iraqi's,
which could put all their lives at risks.

1060
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:26.990
Some Iraqi soldiers rolled their eyes when Americans gave them orders,

1061
01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:31.730
whereas previous Mu Marine lieutenants had barked instructions that they Iraqi

1062
01:08:31.731 --> 01:08:32.600
army leadership.

1063
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:37.870
Travis took a different approach starting with a knock on the door of the Iraqi

1064
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.020
Lieutenant Julale.
Good day lieutenant.

1065
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:45.590
I was wondering if I could speak with you about the upcoming raid on the high

1066
01:08:45.591 --> 01:08:49.370
value target in the industrial sector.
Travis said through the interpreter.

1067
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.020
I was wondering what time you think you would like to execute our mission.

1068
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:59.300
I think 5:00 PM would be a good time to leave.
Julale replied,

1069
01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:03.800
my men had a long day and I don't want to keep them up too late.
Okay.

1070
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:07.310
Travis said,
but I'm wondering if you might consider leaving a bit later,

1071
01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:08.840
possibly after sunset.

1072
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.160
My concern is that our presence during daylight could endanger neighbors who

1073
01:09:13.161 --> 01:09:14.780
live near the house.
We're going to strike,

1074
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:17.690
not to mention little children who could be playing in the street.

1075
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.610
Respectfully lieutenant,

1076
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:23.390
I wouldn't want to be the one to tell their parents that their son or daughter

1077
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:28.450
might still be alive if we had waited a couple more hours after a pause and a

1078
01:09:29.391 --> 01:09:32.990
sip of water.
The Iraqi Knauf officer nodded.

1079
01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:37.910
The raid would not start until 8:00 PM so again,

1080
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:42.170
real leadership and I talk about this all the time in here,

1081
01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:43.970
you know the real leaders aren't barking orders.

1082
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.950
The real leaders are the ones that are flanking and using indirect approaches

1083
01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.710
with the people that they're trying to influence.
And there's a,

1084
01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:53.570
just a phenomenal example of that.

1085
01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.290
Got some email here,
email coming from Travis,

1086
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.810
send it to you,
you'll send it to the family and,

1087
01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.950
and some of his buddies said to Brendan as well,
here we go.

1088
01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:14.010
All my job is definitely going well.

1089
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:16.380
After all the horror stories we hear,

1090
01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:20.670
we heard about the Iraqi armor army and their unwillingness to work with the

1091
01:10:20.671 --> 01:10:25.500
myths.
They have been very open and willing to listen to advice.

1092
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:30.900
Creating an initial relationship with my counterparts was the right move and it

1093
01:10:30.901 --> 01:10:34.230
has allowed me to help them start shaping operations.

1094
01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.490
There are many dedicated men in this army and it's been an eye opening

1095
01:10:38.491 --> 01:10:43.200
experience so far.
The Best Ias,
that's our Iraqi army soldier.

1096
01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:47.130
The best ias are definitely dedicated to their cause and have a warrior

1097
01:10:47.131 --> 01:10:50.820
mentality that rivals some Americans.
However,

1098
01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:54.930
there are still those enemies out there that wish us to fail.

1099
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:57.390
There's a lot of work left to do,

1100
01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.200
but the city is definitely at a different place than it was last year.

1101
01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.260
I really feel that is,

1102
01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:07.920
it is at a critical point where if the present situation continues to progress,

1103
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.360
it could have huge positive impact in other areas.
Also,

1104
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.680
I've found good balance between my logistics job and my company advisor role.

1105
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.180
Although going on operations definitely requires a good amount of time.

1106
01:11:21.181 --> 01:11:25.680
I'm able to work with a battalion logistics officer on a fairly regular basis.

1107
01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:30.420
I also appreciate all the good food and gear that has been sent.

1108
01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:35.070
Workouts and your support have definitely helped keep me going.

1109
01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.680
As I said before,
we're pretty busy.

1110
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:41.580
If I wanted to take a minute to thank you guys for everything and keep you

1111
01:11:41.581 --> 01:11:45.330
updated,
please continue to write.
I enjoy your updates as well.

1112
01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:49.440
Take care and I'll talk to you soon.
Semper fi,
Travis.

1113
01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:55.190
<v 2>Yeah,
it was one of his,
um,
last notes home,
but you can see,
I mean,</v>

1114
01:11:55.191 --> 01:11:58.850
he's a glass half full type of guy.
You know,
we're,
we're getting it done.

1115
01:11:58.851 --> 01:12:01.790
We're working hard.
We're going to make a difference.
You know,

1116
01:12:01.791 --> 01:12:04.290
that's sort of how he approached everything and,

1117
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:07.340
and that was what he was trying to share.

1118
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.190
Interesting thing also about the logistics were all,

1119
01:12:10.191 --> 01:12:12.690
because when I was over there talking to the,

1120
01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:16.250
the logistics guy that he worked with sorta in a kidding way,

1121
01:12:16.251 --> 01:12:20.240
said you have lieutenant Mannion was a horrible logistics officer and they

1122
01:12:20.241 --> 01:12:22.970
started laughing.
He said he's never,
he was always on patrol.

1123
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.680
He was never there with us when we had to do logistics stuff.
So

1124
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.910
<v 0>that's,
I guess that's expected.</v>

1125
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:41.590
Now we're going
back to the book the next morning,

1126
01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:45.310
Travis and his teammates are woke around 5:30 AM to a huge explosion.

1127
01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:48.940
A few minutes later,
they learned that observation post Baghdad,

1128
01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:53.200
a new makeshift based they had been working to set up in Fallujah was a pile of

1129
01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:54.034
rubble.

1130
01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:55.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1131
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:59.350
<v 0>They go to that location with gunfire initially surrounding them before a secure</v>

1132
01:12:59.351 --> 01:13:03.400
perimeter was established.
Travis Elvino my saying that right,

1133
01:13:03.401 --> 01:13:08.320
I'll be not al albino and others spent the next eight hours and ring and

1134
01:13:08.321 --> 01:13:12.760
reentering the rubble while their team members controlled the crowd outside for

1135
01:13:12.761 --> 01:13:13.594
all they knew,

1136
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.840
the rest of the bombed out complex could have crumbled or there could've been

1137
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:21.310
other bombs,
tide time to go off.
When the quick reaction force arrived,

1138
01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.480
they went into the ruins anyway,
carrying a large flashlight,

1139
01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:29.830
Travis crawled into the rubble sweating profusely due to the heat,

1140
01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.150
which is exam exacerbated by small fires burning throughout the compound.

1141
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.890
Travis dug through dirt,

1142
01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:39.820
sand and remnants of brick searching for trapped Iraqis.

1143
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:44.220
Travis,
I'll be new and their teammates recovered too.

1144
01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:46.930
Injured Iraqis and two dead bodies from the attack side.

1145
01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:52.330
They're selfless actions had an enduring impact on many of the Iraqis who bore

1146
01:13:52.331 --> 01:13:56.830
witness.
So you know,
this is even in America when there's something,
when a bomb,

1147
01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.070
when a,
when a building is collapsing,
they don't,
you know,
it's really,

1148
01:14:00.071 --> 01:14:03.640
really risky to go in there and Travis was like,
no,
we're going in.

1149
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:06.760
There might be survivors,
Iraqi civilians.

1150
01:14:06.761 --> 01:14:09.140
He has no idea or maybe they were military guys.
He has no idea.

1151
01:14:09.141 --> 01:14:12.070
He didn't know them.
He's going to risk his life to go and help them.

1152
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.670
Back to the book.
Less than 24 hours later,
Travis,

1153
01:14:18.671 --> 01:14:22.660
his ears were ringing after an IED blew up underneath his vehicle.

1154
01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:23.771
The blast,

1155
01:14:23.771 --> 01:14:28.480
jarring pounding force loudly and abruptly halted his vehicles patrol through

1156
01:14:28.481 --> 01:14:31.150
the city's volatile eastern industrial sector.

1157
01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:36.640
Travis had encountered during his first deployment and as recently as nine days

1158
01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:41.641
earlier after ensuring that fellow Americans and Iraqis were uninjured.

1159
01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:45.550
Travis looked down at the sandy street where the crude explosive device was

1160
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:49.960
buried.
See that wire Travis said to another Iraqi lieutenant,

1161
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.590
that's a command wire and it's stretching towards that building.

1162
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:55.690
Gather your men and follow me.

1163
01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:58.060
He said to the Iraqi before turning to his marines,

1164
01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:02.920
you and the other guys cover us just in case there are snipers.
Lieutenant,

1165
01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.600
why don't we just leave the Iraqi said to Travis,

1166
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.590
because they'll keep planting bombs around here in Kilmore of my men,

1167
01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:16.630
more of your men and probably kill some kids.
Travis said,
so respectfully,

1168
01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:17.260
lieutenant,

1169
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.500
I'm going over there to find out who's responsible with or without you.

1170
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:23.250
After a brief pause,

1171
01:15:23.251 --> 01:15:26.760
the Iraqi lieutenant got three of his men and followed Travis as he traced the

1172
01:15:26.761 --> 01:15:31.290
command wires,
origin,
rounding a corner,
Travis saw man in civilian clothes,

1173
01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.990
kneeling over what appeared to be a pile of grenades,

1174
01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.130
which along with the attach wires appeared to be some sort of booby trap.

1175
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.150
Without hesitation,
Travis squared up to confront the threat.

1176
01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:47.160
The marines out on the street heard the pop of Travis m two o three grenade

1177
01:15:47.161 --> 01:15:49.500
launcher and the subsequent explosion.

1178
01:15:50.010 --> 01:15:53.910
Several ran toward the sound while other stayed to keep watch over the exterior.

1179
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:58.770
The tall,
sweaty and surgeon took off running.
Now being chased by a fearless,

1180
01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:01.320
determined marine.
Travis had the,

1181
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:05.490
a bad guy in his sights and he wasn't going to let him get away.
Stop.

1182
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:08.400
Travis shouted an Arabic while pursuing this suspect.

1183
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:12.630
By the time the U S and Iraqi reinforcements arrived,

1184
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:16.050
Travis was dragging the frightened suspect down off a wall.

1185
01:16:16.051 --> 01:16:18.420
He had tried to scale and an unsuccessful attempt,

1186
01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:22.530
unsuccessful attempt to escape after body slamming him to the ground.

1187
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.380
Travis put the insurgence,
hands behind his back,

1188
01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:28.890
then made sure he was taken in for questioning.

1189
01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.260
The suspect eventually led the Mitt team to a room not far from the booby trap,

1190
01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:39.090
which contained grenades and many more bomb making materials without losing any

1191
01:16:39.091 --> 01:16:42.540
lives or ruffling more feathers in the Sunni enclave,

1192
01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:47.690
Travis had helped remove Ganley weapons and another terrorist from Falucia

1193
01:16:48.001 --> 01:16:48.834
streets.

1194
01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:55.380
<v 2>Yeah.
So,
um,
when I heard that story,</v>

1195
01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:56.910
what do was share with me?

1196
01:16:57.690 --> 01:17:01.560
One of the other parts of it is that when Travis ended up catching this guy,

1197
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:06.810
put a,
I guess a good rest of them move on,
put him down to ground,
uh,

1198
01:17:06.811 --> 01:17:10.760
the Iraqis actually wanting to take this guy out,
you know,
and that he's like,
no,

1199
01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:15.400
you're not doing that.
We're taking them back,
you know,
and uh,

1200
01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:18.020
they figured we'll just take care of this guy right here right now.

1201
01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:23.570
<v 0>Yeah.
And they just,
he just got,
Travis got,
just got hit with an Iud.</v>

1202
01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:26.570
And by the way,
it must have gone low order,

1203
01:17:26.571 --> 01:17:30.620
which means it must not have detonated properly because if you're in a Humvee

1204
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:34.490
and you can hit with a legitimate IED,
it hits your vehicle under your vehicle,

1205
01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:37.850
your chances of Bible isn't great.
And,

1206
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.350
and so to have this guy actually hit you with an ID that you're lucky enough to

1207
01:17:42.351 --> 01:17:46.910
survive and then you catch him
and then,
you know,

1208
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:50.600
I bet you that,
I wonder,
we could,
I wish we could find out if the,

1209
01:17:50.601 --> 01:17:52.130
if the Iraqis that saw this,

1210
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:56.300
if we could find out what wrestling move here used to put the city surgeon on

1211
01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:58.390
his back.
They get suplex.
Yeah,

1212
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:03.800
he had a good headlock.
Oh
yeah.

1213
01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.380
I bet that was not a happy in surgeon at that point.

1214
01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.740
But you know this also the other thing that was good,
good about this as it,

1215
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:13.400
it shows you how Travis had to lead from the front because like I said,

1216
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:18.050
the Iraqis are just content to say,
hey,
let's just go back to base.
You know,

1217
01:18:18.051 --> 01:18:20.960
let's just leave that,
that's very common for them.

1218
01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:25.430
And Travis has to lead from the front,
has to say,
no,
we're going to stay.

1219
01:18:25.431 --> 01:18:28.580
You can stay here,
but I'm going to go get these guys and you know,

1220
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:29.990
kind of shamed them in to help him now.

1221
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:35.260
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
in,
he was doing that,
but he was also seeing it.</v>

1222
01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.300
<v 0>The result of that was progress.
Yeah.</v>

1223
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:40.310
But these guys were starting to take on more and more.
Yeah.

1224
01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:41.880
And that was important to them.

1225
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.670
Even just the fact that they followed him and you know,
that's,

1226
01:18:44.671 --> 01:18:45.480
that's what they're doing.

1227
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.180
And then what they do is they gain confidence and they say,
yeah,
you know,

1228
01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:49.290
we can do this too.
And,

1229
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:52.110
and that's how you eventually turned over battlespace to him.
Yeah.

1230
01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:57.390
Going back to the book,
half a world away in California,

1231
01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:02.550
Brendan was about to embark on is most difficult child challenged since nine 11

1232
01:19:02.610 --> 01:19:03.443
buds training.

1233
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1234
01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.750
<v 0>So,
you know,</v>

1235
01:19:08.751 --> 01:19:11.960
I just wanted to point out that while Travis is now back in Fallujah,

1236
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.650
Brendan has got his orders and he shows up at buds and you know,

1237
01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:19.340
he trained super hard to get ready for it.
And,
and there we go.

1238
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:24.310
While helping turn the tide in Fallujah.

1239
01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:28.180
First Lieutenant Travis Manion wrote a letter to the intelligence or one of his

1240
01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:32.470
hometown newspapers in Bucks County,
Pennsylvania.

1241
01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:37.930
And here's that letter.
There are many views on our mission here.
However,

1242
01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:42.310
all I can say with certainty is that there are thousands of Americans over here

1243
01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:45.280
working hard towards a positive outcome and Iraq.

1244
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:46.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1245
01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:47.260
<v 0>Every day I'm here,</v>

1246
01:19:47.261 --> 01:19:51.130
I see great things being accomplished under harsh circumstances from young

1247
01:19:51.131 --> 01:19:55.630
Americans.
I'm truly honored to serve B side,

1248
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:57.820
these marines,
sailors,
soldiers,
and airmen.

1249
01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:02.980
I'm not sure the average American sees the positives these service men and women

1250
01:20:02.981 --> 01:20:07.950
accomplish or even understands the sacrifices of their efforts.
However,

1251
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:13.050
whatever course of action our leadership decides upon there are those in
waiting,

1252
01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:18.090
ready to carry out the mission in support of our country and in defense of its

1253
01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:22.050
people and their freedoms.
Respectfully,

1254
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:26.130
Travis Mannion,
First Lieutenant United States Marine Corps.

1255
01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.250
Yeah,
that sums sums it up totally for him.
I mean,

1256
01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:34.460
you always knew where Travis was coming from.

1257
01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:39.650
Very straightforward and,
and I mean obviously I agree with them.
That's,

1258
01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:42.830
that's all.
A lot of people don't understand it and still don't.

1259
01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.200
A lot of people still don't understand the,

1260
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:49.670
the positive things that were occurring over in Iraq.

1261
01:20:49.671 --> 01:20:54.110
The positive things that the simple,
having lunch with them,

1262
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:57.920
the simple trying to prevent collateral damage.
You know,

1263
01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:01.340
that's been mentioned several times.
You know,
that the Iraqi soldiers,

1264
01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:04.490
they get content,
somebody shoots at them,
they shoot in 360 degrees,

1265
01:21:04.491 --> 01:21:07.880
they don't care where it hits and they're doing everything they can to train

1266
01:21:07.881 --> 01:21:08.310
them and,

1267
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:13.250
and put some discipline on them so that they don't hurt those civilians.
So,

1268
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.050
and the willingness,
you know,
you guys tell us what to do,
you guys give us,

1269
01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.930
give us the mission and we're standing here and we'll get it accomplished.

1270
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:28.210
So now they're looking at up,
uh,

1271
01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:33.180
a mission in an area of Fallujah,
which is called the pizza slice.

1272
01:21:33.181 --> 01:21:34.860
And if you go look at a map of Fallujah,

1273
01:21:34.861 --> 01:21:37.440
it's really obvious to figure out where the pizza slices I did.

1274
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:39.690
I did actually did one operation,

1275
01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:42.030
my first deployment to Iraq to in the pizza slice.

1276
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.850
And they're looking at doing an operation there.

1277
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:48.330
They got some intelligence that there's a bad guy there that they want to go and

1278
01:21:48.331 --> 01:21:51.510
get.
And we're going back to the book.

1279
01:21:51.511 --> 01:21:54.480
After discussing the idea with several fellow officers,

1280
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:58.240
including Travis Major Qubica,
I say that right?
It could.
Vicky.
Yeah.

1281
01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:03.530
Major Kabuki announced that a team would head into the pizza slice to follow up

1282
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:06.450
on new intelligence about the snipers whereabouts.

1283
01:22:06.451 --> 01:22:08.850
So it's a sniper that they're going after an enemy's sniper.

1284
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.560
Hopefully they could find the terrorist sniper who was shooting at US marines,

1285
01:22:15.661 --> 01:22:20.310
Iraqi soldiers and civilians to American Humvees would accompany to full

1286
01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:24.680
vehicles of Iraqi army troops in one home.

1287
01:22:24.681 --> 01:22:27.290
V would be Kabuki,
Albinos,
and Kim.

1288
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:32.250
They would be joined by the driver,

1289
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:37.500
Staff Sergeant Paul Petty and the Turret Gunner,
Staff Sergeant Josh Wilson,

1290
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.770
Marangu and Segall seagull,
Marangu and seagull seagull,
Chuck Segal,

1291
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:46.950
merengue and Siegel would ride in the second home.
V,

1292
01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:51.600
the driver would be staff sergeant Chad Marquette,
Turret gunner,

1293
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:57.080
corporal briner and Mohammed and Iraqi interpreter Travis and second Lieutenant

1294
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:03.450
Scott Alexander,
a friend and fellow Mitt team member.

1295
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.930
We're supposed to go to a nearby school with Iraqi soldiers and hand out candy,

1296
01:23:07.931 --> 01:23:10.900
crayons and coloring books to local kits.

1297
01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:14.770
Travis who was excited about the mission because he cared about the Iraqis and

1298
01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:17.440
love to see the smiles on the faces of the kids.

1299
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:19.900
So they got two operations that they're about to execute.

1300
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:24.940
One of them is to go and hunt down the sniper and the other one is to go do some

1301
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.360
build.
Some wins,
some hearts and minds handing out candy to the kids.

1302
01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.313
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1303
01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:35.310
<v 0>now,
Kim is one of the other Mitt team officers.
He's the ops.
Oh,</v>

1304
01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:39.780
the ops officer.
That's,
that's your cam is,
and we're going back to the book Kim,

1305
01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:45.170
who had smelled ugliness in the air when he woke up that morning and had

1306
01:23:45.541 --> 01:23:48.960
reiterated,
reiterated his uneasiness just minutes earlier,

1307
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:52.800
told Travis at the smiles of Iraqi school,
children will be a welcome sight.

1308
01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:57.420
Kim was a brave marine who repeatedly distinguished himself on the battlefield,

1309
01:23:57.690 --> 01:24:01.650
but on this day he felt worn down.
Fortunately,

1310
01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:06.680
he and Travis were close enough that he felt confident asking his friend to take

1311
01:24:06.961 --> 01:24:10.680
his place on major Qubica cheese pizza slice patrol team.

1312
01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:16.500
Is it cool if I had over to the school instead?
Kim asked,
no problem.

1313
01:24:16.501 --> 01:24:21.501
Travis replied his eyes lighting up because he knew this meant he could help go

1314
01:24:21.691 --> 01:24:23.730
find the sniper.
Are you sure?

1315
01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.600
Kevin's sistered go ahead with Scott to the school.
Travis said,

1316
01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:31.830
we're all good.
Thanks Travis.
Kim said,
I'll see you in a bit.

1317
01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:34.950
See you back here.
Travis said with a nod.

1318
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:40.150
<v 2>Yes.
So I'm never knew that story.
And when we're writing the book,</v>

1319
01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:44.830
start to talk to Chris about that day and you know,
he said,
hey,

1320
01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:48.700
I've got something I want to share.
Did I never has shared before.

1321
01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:49.780
And you mentioned that,
you know,

1322
01:24:49.781 --> 01:24:54.160
we're supposed to be me on that patrol magic w would take for him to sort of

1323
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:57.760
come forward that story.
But he and in,
uh,

1324
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.830
Travis and Scott were really close and I know it had to be bothering him for a

1325
01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:04.840
while and he,
he shared that.
So,

1326
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:13.620
<v 0>so they roll into the pizza slice,
which again,
this is</v>

1327
01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.190
just to do,
it's a picture in your mind,
what it looks like.

1328
01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.280
It's you kind of your stereotypical combat Iraq city,

1329
01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:27.390
small,
narrow streets,
you know,
trash in the streets,

1330
01:25:27.570 --> 01:25:30.450
buildings really close together.
Threats everywhere.

1331
01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:34.860
Dirty rundown wires everywhere.
It's just a,

1332
01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:39.750
it's kind of your stereotypical Iraqi combat city.

1333
01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.310
That's exactly what it,

1334
01:25:41.311 --> 01:25:46.311
what it is in the pizza slice and Falucia there in their perimeter and boom.

1335
01:25:48.121 --> 01:25:49.080
Here we go to the book.

1336
01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:53.250
The enemy sniper pulled the trigger blasting what felt like a metal pipe

1337
01:25:53.251 --> 01:25:55.740
throughout binos lower left album,
abdomen,

1338
01:25:56.250 --> 01:26:00.150
the bullet which ricocheted off the Corman's radio then tore through his left

1339
01:26:00.151 --> 01:26:03.120
lung.
How Beano fell to his knees,

1340
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:06.140
dropping his weapon and landing flat on his face in the sword.

1341
01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:09.740
Trash filled streets.
Mother fucker yelled petty,

1342
01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.020
who had gotten a thumbs up from the dock.
A split second before in an instant,

1343
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:17.960
Travis and cubic,
he started running toward the wounded.

1344
01:26:17.961 --> 01:26:22.670
Korman casualty screamed the court,
the Turret gunner of the other American home.

1345
01:26:22.671 --> 01:26:27.140
V He was the only one in the vehicle that to see our Beano go down.

1346
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.860
Everyone in the Humvee froze Iraqi.

1347
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:36.430
A Stone Marangu yelled out in response despite the sudden jolt of adrenaline

1348
01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.850
there.
Heart sank when they heard the gunners response,
it's doc,

1349
01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.180
he yelled,
opening fire ambush.

1350
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:49.340
Travis reacted as soon as the first shot rang out.
He took off running toward us.

1351
01:26:49.341 --> 01:26:52.240
Wounded comrade as the thunder sound of American Turk.

1352
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:55.010
Gunfire ring out in the once quiet alleyway,

1353
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:58.070
even with the enemy shooting above from above.

1354
01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.200
Travis didn't care about his own safety.

1355
01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:04.040
He knew he this could be his only chance to save doc

1356
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:06.950
at the other American home.

1357
01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:11.951
V Marangu and Segal also took off in albinos direction.

1358
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:15.770
Though V,
we're trained to never run towards a sniper's victim.

1359
01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:20.690
The warrior ethos of never leaving a fallen comrade behind had overwritten their

1360
01:27:20.691 --> 01:27:25.100
sensibilities.
Travis,
her reached doc first,

1361
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.270
grabbed him by the left shoulder and cubic III who was running close behind

1362
01:27:29.271 --> 01:27:33.860
clutched albinos right arm.
A few seconds later,
come on,
doc.

1363
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:35.600
Travis yelled as he,

1364
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.080
as he and the major polled albino close to the Humvee bullets were now raining

1365
01:27:41.571 --> 01:27:43.220
down from multiple rooftops,

1366
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.930
which meant that more insurgents had been waiting with the sniper to ambush the

1367
01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:50.000
American Iraqi and Iraqi troops.

1368
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:55.250
The Mitt team was encircled by insurgents and without a fierce counter attack,

1369
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:58.460
the entire patrol was almost certainly doomed.

1370
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:01.820
As bedlam ensued,

1371
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.700
the Marines realized that both Iraqi vehicles in their patrol were gone.

1372
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.910
After the Iraqi soldiers heard the gunfire.

1373
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:15.680
The front vehicle subsequently hit an IED while trying to loop around towards a

1374
01:28:15.681 --> 01:28:18.890
better fighting position.
The Iraqi's were stranded,

1375
01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:23.990
which meant nine Americans and their interpreter were left outnumbered in a

1376
01:28:23.991 --> 01:28:25.970
confined,
chaotic space.

1377
01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:32.230
<v 2>Yeah.
So,
um,
you know,</v>

1378
01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.250
with Travis that day,
you know,
he,

1379
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.440
he helped pull doc and doc said,

1380
01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.160
when I went to see dock at the Bethesda hospital,
he said,
you know,

1381
01:28:42.161 --> 01:28:46.630
I just felt this,
this big hand,
come in and grab me and pull me in.

1382
01:28:47.410 --> 01:28:51.170
And they were surrounded there and,
and um,
you know,
was,
uh,

1383
01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:55.660
the sniper was there firing away.
Um,

1384
01:28:55.690 --> 01:28:59.350
I don't know if you're going to share,
but chuck Siegel was also wounded.
Yup.

1385
01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.530
As he,
he came actually got an email from chuck recently just to,

1386
01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:06.083
you know,

1387
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:10.770
so many years later just to sort of talk about that day and what it was all

1388
01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:13.500
about.
But you can imagine that the uh,

1389
01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:17.640
the cloud of war chaos,
confusion,

1390
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:22.470
nobody really knows what's going on is I talked to the guys that were there that

1391
01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:26.580
day.
Nobody was really sure where things were coming from.

1392
01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.410
They just knew they were in big trouble.

1393
01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.160
<v 0>Yeah.
That's one of the hardest things about the urban environment.</v>

1394
01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:34.770
It happens in all environments,
but in the urban environment,

1395
01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.710
you hear shots coming in,
you don't know where they're coming from.

1396
01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:40.800
It's very difficult to tell because the sound reflects and refracts off the

1397
01:29:40.801 --> 01:29:44.360
different buildings and you know,
the sniper or the,

1398
01:29:44.361 --> 01:29:48.180
the shooters can be one or two rooms deep.
You did,
you just don't know where the,

1399
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:53.940
where the,
where the rounds are coming from and it's just very,
very confusing.

1400
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:57.440
<v 2>Lot of confusion from,
from all the guys I spoke with.</v>

1401
01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.193
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1402
01:30:00.370 --> 01:30:02.500
<v 0>Going back to the book here,
Travis and cubic.</v>

1403
01:30:02.501 --> 01:30:07.030
He dragged lb no out of the kill zone and closer to the vehicles front side

1404
01:30:07.031 --> 01:30:09.850
where the sniper couldn't deliver a fatal blow to their bleeding,

1405
01:30:10.150 --> 01:30:14.080
gasping Korman as they tended to albinos wounds.

1406
01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:18.460
Travis saw Marangu and Segal running toward him at full speed.

1407
01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.710
Another Pearson crack of gunfire abruptly echoed through the alley.

1408
01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:27.640
It an instant Siegel was somersaulting in midair,

1409
01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:32.080
feeling like Mike Tyson had just punched him in the stomach and landing in the

1410
01:30:32.081 --> 01:30:37.081
middle of the bullet riddled street all around Segal who broke his law rifle

1411
01:30:38.021 --> 01:30:42.490
wall collapsing the ground,
uh,
hectic battle was unfolding in an eerie,

1412
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:44.200
slow motion.
Silence,

1413
01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:47.920
seagulls wrist convulsed with tremendous pain.

1414
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.980
The sniper was firing at the wounded marine as he lay in the street.

1415
01:30:51.190 --> 01:30:54.700
And the young lance corporal who had just been shot in the wrist and still

1416
01:30:54.701 --> 01:30:56.860
unbeknownst to him also in the stomach,

1417
01:30:57.130 --> 01:31:01.420
would soon be dead if he didn't get in front of that Humvee as seagull.

1418
01:31:01.421 --> 01:31:02.740
Late powerless,

1419
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:06.610
unable to do anything but wait for the crushing blow of another sniper bullet.

1420
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:11.740
Travis pulled him out of the snipers crosshairs.
Moments later,

1421
01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:16.570
Segal lay next to Al [inaudible] who is still being worked on by cubic

1422
01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:20.210
[inaudible].
So again,

1423
01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:25.460
you know,
if you got a sniper scenario and there's a guy down,

1424
01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:30.350
the last thing you want to do is run over to try and help get him out of that

1425
01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:31.184
situation.

1426
01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:35.780
Unless you're Travis and then that's the first thing you're going to do.

1427
01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:37.563
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1428
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:43.720
<v 0>By the time the confused Lance corporal looked up into the dust,</v>

1429
01:31:43.721 --> 01:31:48.460
Travis was gone.
He had already run back into a cloud of bullets.

1430
01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:52.990
Travis dashed across the street not far from where Segal had been hit twice,

1431
01:31:52.991 --> 01:31:56.860
and merengue had barely escaped death without blinking.

1432
01:31:56.950 --> 01:32:01.330
He blasts or grenade onto one of the of buildings sending chunks of concrete

1433
01:32:01.331 --> 01:32:04.840
tumbling to the ground.
When Travis switched to m four rounds,

1434
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.390
his suppressing fire was equally relentless,

1435
01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:12.600
which gave Ku Biki and Marangu enough time to help the wounded with one rooftop

1436
01:32:12.671 --> 01:32:16.660
silent after stunned and surgeons had experienced the crushing power of Travis's

1437
01:32:16.690 --> 01:32:18.400
grenades and countless and four rounds,

1438
01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:22.720
the battles tide begin to turn Siegel and Alby.
No,

1439
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.250
couldn't see Travis firing,

1440
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:27.850
but they could hear the welcome sounds of the American counter attack,

1441
01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:31.000
which only pause when Travis needed to reload

1442
01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:34.190
go.

1443
01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:38.150
Travis scream to his fellow officers who moved into new positions so they could

1444
01:32:38.151 --> 01:32:40.340
join him in the fire in firing at the enemy.

1445
01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.720
Travis moving east in the alleyway from the Humvees passenger side to the

1446
01:32:44.721 --> 01:32:45.471
driver's side,

1447
01:32:45.471 --> 01:32:49.790
is he blast away at another rooftop was now causing the same kind of pandemonium

1448
01:32:49.791 --> 01:32:54.791
among the enemy that the sniper initially wrought on the Americans just in front

1449
01:32:54.891 --> 01:32:59.510
of Seagull.
The corpsman initially pulled to safety by Travis at cubic.

1450
01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.090
He dragged himself almost completely under the vehicle with only his leg

1451
01:33:03.091 --> 01:33:03.924
sticking out,

1452
01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:08.330
desperately trying to breathe while tasting a mixture of sand and his own blood.

1453
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:13.500
Albinos.
Almost certain he was going to die
amid dizziness,

1454
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:17.010
extreme thirst and the crashing sounds of concrete.

1455
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:21.330
The wounded Corman pictured his mother whom he didn't want to suffer in the wake

1456
01:33:21.331 --> 01:33:22.164
of his death,

1457
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:26.490
but at the same time I'll be no could see Travis boots.

1458
01:33:26.730 --> 01:33:30.240
Travis Travis's boots firmly planted in the sand while he fired it.

1459
01:33:30.241 --> 01:33:33.630
Enemy positions.
The situation was bleak,

1460
01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.540
but maybe there was still a chance to survive.

1461
01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:43.200
So you got Travis,
it's interesting.

1462
01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:48.090
They use the word counter attack and usually when you think of a counter attack,

1463
01:33:48.091 --> 01:33:49.440
you think of a platoon,

1464
01:33:49.441 --> 01:33:53.820
or at least a squad that's maneuvering to counter attack an enemy.

1465
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:58.830
And in this situation we got a one man counter attack.
That's,

1466
01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:03.780
that's the initiative is Travis stepping up,
putting down suppressive fire,

1467
01:34:03.781 --> 01:34:05.160
putting down grenade fire.

1468
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.310
You're supposed himself to the enemy to make that happen.

1469
01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:10.910
<v 2>Well,</v>

1470
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:15.910
trying to build the momentum the other way because the momentum is coming in so,

1471
01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:16.981
so much.

1472
01:34:16.981 --> 01:34:21.981
So on the other side that you got to sort of get out and get it on them.

1473
01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.100
Get the rounds on them.
Yeah.
To have them,
you know,

1474
01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:27.540
lose that momentum.

1475
01:34:27.690 --> 01:34:31.230
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
and just like any military unit,
the insurgents,</v>

1476
01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:33.240
if they have the upper hand,
they're going to press.

1477
01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:36.030
But the minute you can press them back and you get the upper hand,

1478
01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.880
the chances are they're gonna,
they're gonna retreat because they don't,

1479
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.610
they're not holding the ground.
They don't care if they lose ground,

1480
01:34:41.611 --> 01:34:46.170
they'll run away.
They want to live.
They're cowards and so they,
they'll,

1481
01:34:46.171 --> 01:34:50.490
they'll back away.
But you know,
if you don't do that,

1482
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.770
if you don't step up and you don't take the initiative,

1483
01:34:52.771 --> 01:34:55.800
they will absolutely override the overrun you.

1484
01:34:56.490 --> 01:35:00.620
And so one man counter attack here and then,

1485
01:35:00.621 --> 01:35:03.890
and then he's yelling to his teammates,
hey,
go help out.
Let's go.

1486
01:35:03.891 --> 01:35:06.140
Let's make this happen.
Back to the book.

1487
01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:09.770
Although the sniper would usually have been long gone by now,

1488
01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:14.750
the AK 47 fire from other buildings cost so much initial confusion that the Mitt

1489
01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:19.751
team still wasn't sure which building he had fired from like a vulture circling

1490
01:35:21.591 --> 01:35:22.424
his prey.

1491
01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:26.960
The enemy marksman continued scanning the alley before spotting Travis who's

1492
01:35:26.961 --> 01:35:28.460
firing away on another rooftop.

1493
01:35:29.150 --> 01:35:33.440
So this is a cover and move situation to where the snipers taking precision

1494
01:35:33.441 --> 01:35:34.274
shots,

1495
01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.150
but the guys can't really identify because they're getting shot at from a bunch

1496
01:35:38.151 --> 01:35:39.620
of different locations as well.

1497
01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:42.793
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1498
01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:44.350
<v 0>Back to the book across the city.</v>

1499
01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:49.500
First Lieutenant Kim was handing Kranz to smiling Iraqi kids with Second

1500
01:35:49.901 --> 01:35:54.040
Lieutenant Alexander though Kim wondered how Travis and the guys were fairing

1501
01:35:54.041 --> 01:35:55.240
inside the pizza slice.

1502
01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:59.320
They'd been through so many battles in the last five months without a casualty

1503
01:35:59.321 --> 01:36:01.600
that the Mitt team seemed indestructible.

1504
01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:04.810
As Kim knelt with a happy child,

1505
01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:09.940
he suddenly heard unintelligible screaming from the radio inside his vehicle.

1506
01:36:09.941 --> 01:36:13.930
Contact yelled a voice,
possibly staff Sergeant Perry,

1507
01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:18.550
the driver of the Hum v Cam was originally supposed to be in Kim.

1508
01:36:18.551 --> 01:36:22.900
Look straight at Alexander who had heard the same frantic sounds and both men

1509
01:36:22.901 --> 01:36:26.170
motion to their Iraqi counterparts to sit with the kids while they check things

1510
01:36:26.171 --> 01:36:29.800
out.
The transmissions,
the transmissions were broken,

1511
01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:34.840
but now the sound of Petty's voice screaming contact came through clear crystal

1512
01:36:34.841 --> 01:36:38.110
clear about saying a single word about what to do next.

1513
01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:41.950
Kim and Alexander jumped into separate vehicles with their respective drivers,

1514
01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:46.000
told the Iraqis to handle the rest of the school supply drop and sped towards

1515
01:36:46.001 --> 01:36:49.660
the,
toward the pizza slice and it's unknown turmoil

1516
01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.820
as they listened to broken radio transmission to try to communicate with Perry

1517
01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:57.340
who was frantically trying to contact camp collusion.

1518
01:36:57.341 --> 01:36:58.780
Request a quick reaction force.

1519
01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:03.550
The Marines silently navigated through the pizza slices.
Narrow,

1520
01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:04.570
confusing streets,

1521
01:37:04.571 --> 01:37:07.960
not completely sure of where their Mitt team brothers were pinned down.

1522
01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.080
They knew a battle was raging,

1523
01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:15.620
but neither marine had any idea how serious it was nor did they realize Albina

1524
01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:20.350
and Siegel had been hit.
After looping around the pizza slice,

1525
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:24.820
the two vehicles turned right onto route Elizabeth near the blackwater bridge

1526
01:37:24.970 --> 01:37:27.760
heading east and the seriousness of the situation.

1527
01:37:27.761 --> 01:37:31.960
Slapped Cam and Alexander in the face normally bust,

1528
01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:37.050
bustling packed marketplace was completely empty if tumbleweeds blowing across

1529
01:37:38.621 --> 01:37:39.071
the street.

1530
01:37:39.071 --> 01:37:42.220
This section of Felicia would've looked exactly like a deserted town in an old

1531
01:37:42.221 --> 01:37:46.540
western spaghetti.
Jesus Christ.
Alexander said,
where the fuck are they came,

1532
01:37:46.541 --> 01:37:50.830
yelled and frustration.
Suddenly they heard gunfire there.
Alexander said,

1533
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:54.460
pointing at the besieged alleyway where the two American humvees were still

1534
01:37:54.461 --> 01:37:55.950
being riddled bullets

1535
01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:01.630
as both marine stopped on route,
Elizabeth facing east,

1536
01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:05.680
the marines jumped out and ran as quickly as they could.
Ducking rifles,

1537
01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:09.100
ducking his rifles continued to crack towards their comrades.

1538
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:14.250
Kim then confronted an image that would stay with him for the rest of his life.

1539
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:18.780
Travis was lying near the back of the driver's side tire of the Humvee.

1540
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:23.160
He had been riding in his eyes wide open,
but glazed over with emptiness.

1541
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:28.200
Kim saw no blood,
but it was obvious that something horrible.

1542
01:38:28.201 --> 01:38:31.680
It occurred in that Richard violent alley

1543
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:36.600
for the first time in the entire deployment,
sheer panic seized.
Kim,

1544
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:38.910
as you ran with Alexander up to Kabuki,

1545
01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:43.650
who was kneeling by Travis while filing firing is nine millimeter handgun at one

1546
01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:46.500
of the buildings.
After running out of rifle ammunition,

1547
01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:51.930
Kim asked,
firing his own rifle,

1548
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:56.400
where do you need us to go get the wounded cubic?
He said,
get them out of here.

1549
01:38:57.270 --> 01:39:01.680
Who else has hit?
Alexander said Siegel and doc could,

1550
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:04.620
you said before moving to another position to continue firing,

1551
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.990
swinging open the passenger side back door for covers.
He fired.

1552
01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:13.440
Kim Saw Siegel who had avoided being shot again,

1553
01:39:13.441 --> 01:39:15.570
but we're still in great pain lying in the backseat.

1554
01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.540
Despite being on his back,

1555
01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:22.380
he was reaching down to the floor trying to find more ammunition for the Turret

1556
01:39:22.381 --> 01:39:25.980
gunner.
His left wrist was bleeding profusely.

1557
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:31.820
The major orders is out.
Kim said,
do you need help?
I can make it.
Sequel said,

1558
01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:35.720
you gotta get Lieutenant Mannion.
I think he's dead.

1559
01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.110
My vehicle's ride over there.
Kim said,
pointing toward route Elizabeth go.

1560
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:45.170
Now that reinforcements had arrived,

1561
01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:48.260
the sniper was gone and the insurgents were pulling back.

1562
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:54.170
Segal mustering all his strength exited the Humvee on the passenger side and

1563
01:39:54.171 --> 01:39:56.780
hurried to Kim's vehicle where he collapsed in the backseat.

1564
01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:01.060
He knew he had been shot in the stomach by this point and wasn't sure if you'd

1565
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:05.000
make it,
but even Segal ran to the intersection.

1566
01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:08.720
Even as Siegel ran to the intersection,
the wounded marines.
Thoughts,

1567
01:40:08.721 --> 01:40:13.721
we're focused on the unforgettable scene he had just witnessed SQL didn't see

1568
01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:16.160
Travis gets shot by the sniper,

1569
01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.640
but after dragging himself to the driver's side of the vehicle,

1570
01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:23.840
the lance corporal were shocked to see the first lieutenant lying face down in

1571
01:40:23.841 --> 01:40:24.674
motionless.

1572
01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:28.640
His arms stretched toward the curb with his feet facing toward the bullet

1573
01:40:28.641 --> 01:40:29.474
riddled vehicle.

1574
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:35.450
When Segal pulled himself towards Travis and asked him where he'd been hit,

1575
01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:37.070
he got no response.

1576
01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.650
He realized Travis were seriously wounded and started feeling underneath his

1577
01:40:42.651 --> 01:40:43.311
fellow marines.

1578
01:40:43.311 --> 01:40:47.600
Body armor with his left hand despite the hone his own aching wrist.

1579
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:52.640
He found a bullet wound on the left side of Travis has rib cage.

1580
01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:59.200
He whispered and Travis is a year.
Hey,
Travis said Segal,

1581
01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:03.400
Segal,
who normally would have addressed him as lieutenant or sir,

1582
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:04.390
I'm here for you.

1583
01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:07.980
<v 0>Travis didn't respond</v>

1585
01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:13.830
even without realizing that the sniper's bullet had struck the first lieutenant

1586
01:41:13.831 --> 01:41:17.810
from the right side and had exited at the spot he was covering with his left

1587
01:41:17.811 --> 01:41:22.530
hand.
Siegel knew the situation was grave when sat,

1588
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.170
when Travis began jerking with convulsions,

1589
01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:30.600
is he dead?
Could Vicki yelled over to Segal while continuing to fire it?

1590
01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:34.850
Enemy positions,
not yet,
but he will be if we don't do something.

1591
01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.180
The lance corporal said his voice shaking

1592
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:43.970
SQL turned to Travis whose eyes were still wide open.

1593
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:49.710
I'm here for you.
Segal repeated over and over again into his ear.

1594
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:56.030
As soon as Kim and Alexander had carry,
they're unresponsive.

1595
01:41:56.031 --> 01:41:59.720
Friend into the vehicle could Vicki ran over and dove into the smoke filled

1596
01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.530
Humvee where he clutched Travis and begin trying to identify as wounds stopping

1597
01:42:03.531 --> 01:42:05.930
the bleeding and perform CPR.

1598
01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:09.820
He ordered petty to start driving towards Camp Falucia.

1599
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.090
While Wilson Wilson fired the last rounds from the Turret.

1600
01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:18.770
This was probably could Vicky's last chance to save his fellow marine.

1601
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:25.790
As for vehicles sped toward Camp Falucia,
Father John Gaten,

1602
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:30.740
Marine Corps chaplain from Pennsylvania sat in his tiny office on the mic,

1603
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:32.420
makeshift American base.

1604
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:37.130
He was reading emails from home while sipping from a large water bottle to keep

1605
01:42:37.131 --> 01:42:39.860
hydrated on the steam.
You Sunday afternoon.

1606
01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:43.060
A few minutes later,
his phone ring,

1607
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:46.810
we got two wounded in action and one possible killed in action.

1608
01:42:46.811 --> 01:42:49.750
Arriving at the field hospital,
a nurse,
a nurse reported

1609
01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:56.230
as the marines ran over to the wooden complex.
He saw a group of Marines,

1610
01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:59.350
Kim Alexander Kubicki,

1611
01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:04.470
Marangu Petty Marquette Wilson and briner huddled like a team on a football

1612
01:43:05.591 --> 01:43:10.180
field as he jogged by one of them,
turned around and looked at him.

1613
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:16.390
Father John saw the redness in the eyes of this marine who had obviously been

1614
01:43:16.391 --> 01:43:21.270
crying.
It was clear that something terrible had happened.

1615
01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:27.450
Any marines with type O positive blood report immediately to field hospital room

1616
01:43:27.451 --> 01:43:29.880
for a voice said over the loudspeaker.

1617
01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:35.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1618
01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:36.490
<v 0>As they tore off.</v>

1619
01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:37.953
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1620
01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.500
<v 0>As they tore off his bloody fatigues before finding the wounds on each side of</v>

1621
01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:46.630
his rib cage and trying to resuscitate him,

1622
01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:50.080
crowds began to form in the hallway outside the operating room.

1623
01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:52.060
Word

1624
01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:55.990
<v 3>was quickly spreading.
That First Lieutenant Travis Mannion,</v>

1625
01:43:56.740 --> 01:44:01.150
the heart and soul of the Mitt team
was badly wounded.

1626
01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:08.070
<v 2>Yeah,
he's a</v>

1627
01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:15.210
gave it all,
you know,
gave it all that day.
He gave it all,

1628
01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:19.740
every moment he was over there and working with the marines,

1629
01:44:19.741 --> 01:44:24.540
working with the Iraqis and,
and um,
you know,

1630
01:44:24.541 --> 01:44:27.150
that that last event

1631
01:44:28.890 --> 01:44:32.820
he ran out of Ammo,
you know,
I was talking to the gunner

1632
01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:38.270
and
start to ask him about what,

1633
01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.800
what he saw trying to figure out,
you know,
the,

1634
01:44:41.190 --> 01:44:45.060
we've got what was written up in his award and just trying to get some insights.

1635
01:44:45.061 --> 01:44:48.090
And the gunner said,
you know,
lieutenant was calling for more ammo.

1636
01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:53.700
So I'm thinking that Travis,
I saw when he was over there,

1637
01:44:53.701 --> 01:44:57.900
he had all sorts of magazines.
So I don't know how many rounds would,

1638
01:44:57.901 --> 01:45:01.200
I'm guessing around maybe 90 to 100 rounds.

1639
01:45:01.201 --> 01:45:06.201
He had one himself and he'd actually laid down a lot of fire to change the

1640
01:45:06.451 --> 01:45:10.230
momentum.
But I,
you know,
he knew what he was doing.

1641
01:45:10.590 --> 01:45:15.180
He exposed himself.
He had to do that to get out there and lay down the fire.

1642
01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.550
And,
uh,
when I spoke to the Gunner Wilson,
he said,
you know,

1643
01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:23.850
we threw out a magazine.
I turned around when I turned back,

1644
01:45:23.851 --> 01:45:25.020
Travis was laying on the ground,

1645
01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:31.160
so maybe he was trying to get that magazine and load it into his weapon.

1646
01:45:32.911 --> 01:45:36.900
He had,
he'd run out all of his ammunition in lane cover for these guys.

1647
01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:43.500
<v 0>Yeah,
no.
And like you said,
I mean,
just somebody had to turn the momentum.</v>

1648
01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:45.990
Yeah.
Otherwise they were going to get overrun.

1649
01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:49.960
<v 2>Yeah.
And he knew that.
He knew that,
if not me,
than who,</v>

1650
01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.800
you know,
he knew what he had to do.

1651
01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:59.140
I know that.
Um,
cause they had lost,
they had,

1652
01:45:59.170 --> 01:46:04.150
I got a letter from [inaudible] shortly afterwards and he said,
you know,

1653
01:46:04.151 --> 01:46:06.790
we're using Travis,
his words to go on because he,

1654
01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.880
they had lost some guys and he had pulled the team and said,
look,

1655
01:46:09.881 --> 01:46:12.550
we got gotta they'd want us to go on,
we've got to keep working,

1656
01:46:12.551 --> 01:46:14.050
we've got to turn the tide here.

1657
01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:19.810
And so he used that session that Travis had with the team and said,
look,

1658
01:46:19.811 --> 01:46:21.820
you know what Travis would think,
you know what we gotta do?

1659
01:46:21.821 --> 01:46:25.120
We gotta keep fighting on.
And that's what they did.

1660
01:46:35.190 --> 01:46:36.023
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1661
01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:40.610
<v 0>Father John Anointed Travis,
his feet instead of prayer,</v>

1662
01:46:41.210 --> 01:46:44.420
has the medical staff tried fevers,
Lee to revive him?

1663
01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:49.860
If only the marine could the doctors

1664
01:46:50.850 --> 01:46:54.270
<v 3>some sign
any sign of life</v>

1665
01:46:58.050 --> 01:47:01.980
<v 0>soon after the physician in charge announced a time of death.</v>

1666
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:04.133
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1667
01:47:04.250 --> 01:47:05.270
<v 0>for the next minute.</v>

1668
01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:09.860
The only sounds heard in the operating room came from the hallway outside

1669
01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:13.880
as doctors and nurses watched in silence.

1670
01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:18.710
Father John Standing above the following us marine broke the silence.

1671
01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:21.640
<v 3>Okay</v>

1672
01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:25.720
<v 0>God,
the father of mercies.
Through the death and resurrection of your son.</v>

1673
01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:31.260
You have reconciled the world to yourself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for

1674
01:47:32.831 --> 01:47:36.700
the forgiveness of sins.
He said,
looking down at Travis

1675
01:47:38.530 --> 01:47:40.210
through the Ministry of the church,

1676
01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:46.560
may God grant you pardon and peace

1677
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:52.860
and I absolve you of your sins in the name of the father,

1678
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:55.790
kind of the sun

1679
01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:00.180
and of the Holy Spirit.

1680
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:05.783
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1681
01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:10.440
<v 0>One by one marines filed past their fallen brother.</v>

1682
01:48:12.150 --> 01:48:12.930
Could Vicky,

1683
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:16.740
the senior officer would desperately administered CPR in the Humvee was the

1684
01:48:16.741 --> 01:48:21.540
first to walk by Moran was next.
Then Wilson,
Marquette and briner.

1685
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:27.900
When petty looked at the fallen first lieutenants face,

1686
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:33.330
he saw an officer who had given everything to the Marine Corps.

1687
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:39.620
When Alexander approached the operating table with tears streaming down his
face,

1688
01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.650
he put his hand on his friend's head.

1689
01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.300
He didn't know how the mission could carry on without them

1690
01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:52.530
came approached the table with weak knees and a broken heart.

1691
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.650
He paused to take one last look at his friend who had saved his life by

1692
01:48:58.651 --> 01:49:03.651
volunteering to go on a patrol he knew would be far more dangerous than a school

1693
01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:06.000
supply drop.

1694
01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:11.670
Pausing for a moment,

1695
01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.540
Kim pondered the story that was already spreading throughout the hospital

1696
01:49:15.541 --> 01:49:18.150
complex.
Without thinking twice,

1697
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.830
Travis had leapt squarely into enemy crosshairs to direct gun fire away from his

1698
01:49:24.831 --> 01:49:25.664
patrol.

1699
01:49:29.610 --> 01:49:32.900
On April 29th,
2007,

1700
01:49:34.190 --> 01:49:37.200
a line of the Iraq war was struck down by a single bullet.

1701
01:49:38.690 --> 01:49:39.523
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1702
01:49:39.710 --> 01:49:44.120
<v 0>Cut through Travis aorta causing massive internal bleeding that couldn't be</v>

1703
01:49:44.121 --> 01:49:44.954
controlled

1704
01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:52.810
though the fallen marines loved ones would undoubtedly suffer.

1705
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:56.890
Everyone else on the pizza slice patrol was still alive

1706
01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:05.180
indeed by fearlessly protecting his marines and the Iraqi serving beside them.

1707
01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:10.890
First Lieutenant Travis men had done his part.

1708
01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:21.200
<v 2>Yeah.
So clearly in,
in writing,
this is sorta</v>

1709
01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:27.730
as a father obviously really tough to to go through and,

1710
01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:33.020
and you know,
talk to the guys who were with him and relive that.

1711
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1712
01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:37.290
<v 2>Uh,
but the other side of it is,
it's a little healing.</v>

1713
01:50:37.650 --> 01:50:42.650
Did this sorta know exactly what was going on and what the guys that were there

1714
01:50:44.071 --> 01:50:48.330
with him,
he felt about his actions that day.

1715
01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:50.450
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1716
01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:52.580
<v 2>And so,
um,
you know,</v>

1717
01:50:52.581 --> 01:50:55.910
as I went through a struggle at times,

1718
01:50:57.610 --> 01:51:01.580
but I realized that,
um,
you know,
unless we tell these stories,

1719
01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:06.350
the rest of the country's not going to know what these guys are doing.

1720
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:09.470
So we got to make sure that we get the word out there.

1721
01:51:09.471 --> 01:51:11.800
And there was a big part of it is,

1722
01:51:12.210 --> 01:51:16.570
is sitting down and talking through that day big part of uh,

1723
01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:18.860
the struggle for me and putting this book together.

1724
01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:24.060
<v 0>And you just,
I mean it's,
it's uh,</v>

1725
01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:26.940
I would say it's a miracle that everyone else lived,

1726
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:31.680
but it's actually just Travis that everyone lived in a situation like that

1727
01:51:31.681 --> 01:51:36.120
surrounded by enemy,
a sniper,
multiple enemy positions firing on you.

1728
01:51:36.121 --> 01:51:37.950
You got nine guys in to hundred.
These,

1729
01:51:38.130 --> 01:51:42.060
that is not a good situation to be in and it's going to take a miracle to get

1730
01:51:42.061 --> 01:51:42.870
out of it.

1731
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:47.250
And the fact that he's the only guy that was killed is incredible.

1732
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:50.820
And it's clearly,
you know,
due to his actions.

1733
01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:52.950
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1734
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:55.290
<v 0>Clearly,
I mean,
again,</v>

1735
01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:00.440
you have the enemy has elevated positions to on the rooftops and yeah.

1736
01:52:02.730 --> 01:52:07.650
So yeah,
I mean it's important obviously to tell the story and people to know the

1737
01:52:07.651 --> 01:52:09.690
sacrifice.
And I mean a lot of,

1738
01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:14.720
a lot of people listen to this that are active duty in the military and that

1739
01:52:16.321 --> 01:52:20.850
sort of aggressiveness on the battlefield when things are going bad is going to

1740
01:52:20.851 --> 01:52:24.660
keep people alive.
And obviously you got to be a courageous,

1741
01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:30.270
courageous human being to do that.
But the alternative,
you know,

1742
01:52:30.271 --> 01:52:34.140
in this case would have been an incredibly horrible,

1743
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:39.270
<v 2>I got it.
Um,
several of the guys were there,</v>

1744
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:41.970
whether it was the doc when I went to see him at Bethesda,

1745
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:47.450
talked about the impact of what Travis or Lieutenant Marangu was there.

1746
01:52:47.451 --> 01:52:50.210
And he sent me a message and said,
hey,
you know,

1747
01:52:50.211 --> 01:52:53.720
there's no doubt in my mind that Travis saved my life and the life of the entire

1748
01:52:53.721 --> 01:52:58.460
patrol that day.
So,
I mean the guys that were there were with them.

1749
01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:01.130
They know what I'm,
yeah.

1750
01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:03.903
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1751
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:09.860
<v 2>In how much longer after this did you start writing this book?</v>

1752
01:53:13.110 --> 01:53:13.943
<v 3>Wow.</v>

1753
01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:17.980
<v 2>About five years afterwards.</v>

1754
01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:22.420
Just start to get down to writing it and I,
you know,

1755
01:53:22.421 --> 01:53:26.920
there's a story behind that too,
right?
I mean I,
uh,

1756
01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:32.190
the last time I talked to Travis was a week before we lost him and it was an

1757
01:53:34.091 --> 01:53:38.350
unusual call because normally I was with my wife and this time I wasn't Isabel

1758
01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:40.750
by myself and he,

1759
01:53:40.751 --> 01:53:43.810
I guess he fell a little bit more open to share with me what was going on.

1760
01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:47.620
And he was,
you could sense that there was a lot happening.

1761
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.760
And he had a message for me,
kept sharing that.
He said,
dad,

1762
01:53:51.761 --> 01:53:53.980
it's incredible what I'm seeing over here.

1763
01:53:53.981 --> 01:53:58.030
It's incredible what these young marines are doing.

1764
01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:00.730
What I'm seeing every day they're fighting in the streets,

1765
01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:02.470
they're putting it on the line.

1766
01:54:02.530 --> 01:54:04.780
I don't think the rest of the country knows what's going on.

1767
01:54:05.490 --> 01:54:07.710
And he knew that cause you go back to Camp Fallujah,

1768
01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:11.410
turn on the TV and see what we were watching back here and then he'd be on

1769
01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:16.210
patrol and just sort of see the incredible things that were going on and it was

1770
01:54:16.211 --> 01:54:17.380
a huge disconnect for him.

1771
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:23.590
And he got cut off several times in that phone call and he kept calling me back

1772
01:54:23.591 --> 01:54:28.330
and he'd start all over again.
Dad,
you,
you,
you really,

1773
01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:31.450
he really got to get the message back to people.

1774
01:54:31.930 --> 01:54:33.820
It's incredible what's happening here.

1775
01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:38.410
You know the American people don't know the incredible things these guys are

1776
01:54:38.411 --> 01:54:43.411
doing and so I got cut off for them the last time and I always signed off to

1777
01:54:45.761 --> 01:54:50.140
tell him how much they loved them and it was the first time that I missed him.

1778
01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:51.730
I figured,
okay,

1779
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:56.260
I'll hear from him next weekend and we got to knock on the door.

1780
01:54:56.450 --> 01:55:00.940
Then next weekend that we lost Travis,
you know,
your worst nightmare,

1781
01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:06.040
your only son.
So proud of them and figured,
okay,

1782
01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.240
most natural thing for us is to roll down the shades,
lock the doors,

1783
01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:12.940
and just tell everyone to go away.

1784
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:16.630
And it was because that last conversation I had with him,

1785
01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:22.200
we knew there was going to be media and sure enough there was pull my wife and

1786
01:55:22.301 --> 01:55:26.260
daughter together.
I said,
you know what?
When they call us,
we're going to talk.

1787
01:55:27.370 --> 01:55:32.290
And really this book is about talking about sharing the stories.

1788
01:55:33.070 --> 01:55:36.400
I've been on that mission since the last time I talked to Travis and he gave me

1789
01:55:36.401 --> 01:55:37.480
that mission to do this.

1790
01:55:37.481 --> 01:55:42.220
And so I was pretty certain early on that was going to do something.

1791
01:55:42.810 --> 01:55:44.400
Initially I thought,
okay,

1792
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:48.840
I heard about Travis and his marines and inclusion and how they turned the tie.

1793
01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.080
So maybe that that would be the story.

1794
01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:56.520
We could talk about how these brave marines and work together with the Iraqis to

1795
01:55:56.521 --> 01:56:00.510
make that happen.
And then we lost Brendan,

1796
01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:04.410
you know,
and I realized,
you know,
maybe it's not that story.

1797
01:56:04.411 --> 01:56:09.270
Maybe it's the bigger story of our navy seals and our marines and everyone that

1798
01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:12.720
it's putting on the uniform and the sacrifices they're making.

1799
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:18.210
And so,
um,
that's why it sort of took me a little while.
I mean,
we had,

1800
01:56:18.211 --> 01:56:21.900
we lost Travisano seven,
we lost Brendan in 2010 when,

1801
01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.000
and I had just come back from,

1802
01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:26.610
from doing some of the stuff over in Iraq started to think,

1803
01:56:26.611 --> 01:56:29.980
well maybe it's a different story and a,

1804
01:56:31.610 --> 01:56:34.050
<v 0>when you do a really,
you know,</v>

1805
01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.040
an amazing job in the book of talking about how you,

1806
01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:43.310
how your family,
how you've,
you and your family,
you know,

1807
01:56:43.311 --> 01:56:45.920
dealt with the loss and,

1808
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:50.540
but is there anything that you find,
I mean,

1809
01:56:50.541 --> 01:56:54.800
did you find it to be sort of therapeutic to say,
look,

1810
01:56:54.801 --> 01:56:55.760
we have a new mission now.

1811
01:56:55.761 --> 01:56:58.970
Our mission is to get the word out and tell the story and learn as much as we

1812
01:56:58.971 --> 01:57:01.460
can about it and let other people know what's going on.

1813
01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:05.630
<v 2>I think it was,
it definitely helped,
you know,</v>

1814
01:57:05.631 --> 01:57:09.470
to know that we could do something with his loss,

1815
01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.860
you know,
get out there and if we could do something to,

1816
01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:18.350
to bridge the gap between the country and our military and our guys and men and

1817
01:57:18.351 --> 01:57:20.950
women serving in uniform,
you know,

1818
01:57:21.010 --> 01:57:23.870
certainly gave us something to get up every morning and,

1819
01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:29.930
and have a reason.
And now when we start thinking about his message,
you know,

1820
01:57:29.931 --> 01:57:31.340
part of that,
if not me,

1821
01:57:31.341 --> 01:57:35.000
then who message that goes back to that last conversation I had with him because

1822
01:57:35.001 --> 01:57:36.230
when we started telling the stories,

1823
01:57:36.231 --> 01:57:40.730
my son in law shared that story with the newspaper and all of a sudden that,

1824
01:57:40.731 --> 01:57:45.500
if not me,
then who is sort of caught on and people started to say,
you know what?

1825
01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.270
I like that it was five simple but really,

1826
01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:51.590
really powerful words.

1827
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:56.660
And that's what we use now as our sort of rally cry for our foundation if not
me.

1828
01:57:56.661 --> 01:57:57.494
The new

1829
01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.860
<v 0>you,
you went through this,
you know,</v>

1830
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:06.950
you went through your loss of Travis and did you get closer with,

1831
01:58:08.431 --> 01:58:12.150
with Brendan after that or did it maintain or,

1832
01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:16.640
<v 2>yeah,
we got a lot closer with Brendan.
I mean,
absolutely.
Uh,</v>

1833
01:58:16.650 --> 01:58:20.130
Brandon was in seal training when we lost Travis,

1834
01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:25.230
and I still remember that call with,
with my wife.
Uh,

1835
01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:29.010
but yeah,
he would come and,
and visit us.
And,
and uh,

1836
01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:34.580
still remember when he came back and he came right up to our place and mostly

1837
01:58:34.801 --> 01:58:38.940
people felt uncomfortable coming to,
to visit the parents by themselves.

1838
01:58:38.941 --> 01:58:40.110
So they'd come in groups.

1839
01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:43.840
But when Brendan called up shortly after he got back and I said,
okay,

1840
01:58:43.841 --> 01:58:46.870
well you come out with brand new,
says I'm coming by myself.

1841
01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:52.140
And we spent the night doing shots patroned at our bar and talking about stories

1842
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:55.090
of he and Travis and their friendship.
And

1843
01:58:55.300 --> 01:59:00.150
<v 0>what was it?
Uh,
another thing was Travis or,
or Brendan had just started buds.</v>

1844
01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:04.570
Yeah.
And you know,
he was saying,
Hey,
I'm going to come home for the funeral.
And,

1845
01:59:04.571 --> 01:59:06.990
and you and your wife said,
no,
you do what you gotta do.

1846
01:59:06.991 --> 01:59:09.900
You gotta get through this training.
You know,
you can come later.

1847
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.640
<v 2>Yeah.
Which is,
well,
we,</v>

1848
01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:17.090
we knew he was just sort of struggling with the loss in a big,
big way.
Any,

1849
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:20.090
any wanted to,
to be there.
And,
you know,

1850
01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:24.880
he was sharing that with my wife real strong.
And,
uh,

1851
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:28.720
you know,
he knew what Travis would want them to do is the carry on and,

1852
01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:34.480
and so we did that,
you know,
and he,
he,
he sure did that in a,

1853
01:59:34.481 --> 01:59:37.060
in a big way out there in San Diego.

1854
01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:43.170
<v 0>Yeah.
And Brendan crushed crushed buds.
And you don't throw that around.</v>

1855
01:59:43.171 --> 01:59:47.490
Bitely you don't throw around.
Some will crushing Bud's lightly.
Uh,

1856
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:48.840
and one of the things,

1857
01:59:48.841 --> 01:59:53.841
one of the quotes that they pull out in here that he applied during buds was one

1858
01:59:54.210 --> 01:59:58.260
of,
one of Brendan's favorite quotes was one,
he rarely spoke out loud,

1859
01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:03.540
but always kept in the back of his mind.
Be Strong,
be accountable,

1860
02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:05.190
never complain.

1861
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:08.680
<v 2>Yeah,
that's Brandon.
Absolutely.</v>

1862
02:00:09.130 --> 02:00:11.020
<v 0>And that attitude going in.</v>

1863
02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:15.340
He ended up being the honor man of his buds class.

1864
02:00:15.370 --> 02:00:19.510
And so the honor man is the guy that's basically the best performer in

1865
02:00:19.511 --> 02:00:24.400
everything.
And again,
you're going to buds,

1866
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:29.380
you got some competitive high level athletes in there and to be the honor man,

1867
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:32.440
you gotta be a bit of a bad ass.

1868
02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:37.240
<v 2>Yeah.
Well some of the guys were there with him share with me that it wasn't even</v>

1869
02:00:37.241 --> 02:00:41.200
close even,
you know,
I mean like he was blowing everything away.

1870
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:45.280
So he was,
he was possessed as they,

1871
02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:46.510
they share with me.

1872
02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:51.900
<v 0>That's a,
that sounds like,
that sounds like he was definitely getting after it.</v>

1873
02:00:51.930 --> 02:00:55.620
And,
and,
and,
you know,
I,
I won't even say,
I imagine,

1874
02:00:55.680 --> 02:01:00.680
I actually know for a fact that Louise and Travis must've fueled his fire beyond

1875
02:01:03.330 --> 02:01:05.160
anyone.
Could be.
He probably had,
you're right,

1876
02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:07.490
there was no co who's going to compete with that.
You know,

1877
02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.080
he knew he had a job to do.

1878
02:01:10.050 --> 02:01:12.770
<v 2>And so much so that when,
um,</v>

1879
02:01:13.590 --> 02:01:18.590
when he got done and graduated and my wife Janet and I were at the wedding with

1880
02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:23.550
Amy and Brendan did,

1881
02:01:23.551 --> 02:01:27.150
he called Janet over and gave Janet is navy seal trident

1882
02:01:28.890 --> 02:01:30.840
and you know,
he just did it privately.

1883
02:01:30.970 --> 02:01:35.190
It was just the way Brandon was gave it to her and said,
you know,

1884
02:01:35.191 --> 02:01:38.790
I couldn't have gotten this without Travis being there with me every step of the

1885
02:01:38.791 --> 02:01:40.550
way and I want you to have this.

1886
02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:46.780
And I was at the other end of the the room and I still remember Jenny coming up

1887
02:01:47.331 --> 02:01:50.210
with tears in her eyes and sharing this story with me.

1888
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:53.480
It was just sort of the type of Guy Brandon was,
you know.

1889
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:56.130
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean that was another thing that they,</v>

1890
02:01:56.150 --> 02:02:00.710
that in the book you talk about is he got the honor man plaque it and like he

1891
02:02:00.711 --> 02:02:04.730
like mailed it to his parents and his attitude was,
hey,
this is an Ami,
you know,

1892
02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:07.340
this is on you.
Thanks for support over the years.
Yeah.

1893
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:11.540
And then give them the trident to,
to your wife,
Janet.
I mean,
just a humble,

1894
02:02:11.541 --> 02:02:14.620
humble guy that always gave credit to everyone else.
And,

1895
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:18.530
and your wife gave him the black bracelet

1896
02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:20.951
that said,

1897
02:02:20.951 --> 02:02:25.951
first Lieutenant Travis Mandian USFC spartan hero leader

1898
02:02:28.150 --> 02:02:30.310
killed them.
Iraq,
Iraqi Freedom.

1899
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.240
29 April of Oh seven.

1900
02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:41.410
And then this had to be hard for you can now you're even closer with Brandon,

1901
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:45.100
with,
with,
with Brendan.
You're even closer with Brendan and

1902
02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:49.540
he tells you guys at his wedding.
So you're,

1903
02:02:49.541 --> 02:02:53.080
they're celebrating the wedding and all of a sudden he says something to tell

1904
02:02:53.081 --> 02:02:58.020
you go to Iraq and 48 hours.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was a,

1905
02:02:58.300 --> 02:02:58.751
and by the way,

1906
02:02:58.751 --> 02:03:00.940
it's going to Falucia did he tell you guys he was going to Fallujah?

1907
02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:06.220
<v 2>Yeah,
he told us where he was headed.
Um,
you know,
hard to believe,</v>

1908
02:03:06.221 --> 02:03:06.491
you know,

1909
02:03:06.491 --> 02:03:11.491
he's there celebrating such a great day and then to find out that his honeymoons

1910
02:03:11.651 --> 02:03:16.360
in Fallujah,
you know,
I think in,
you know,
you hear about,

1911
02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:20.680
we hear so much about our guys in uniform and what they're doing,

1912
02:03:20.681 --> 02:03:23.740
but just sort of think about this,
those types of sacrifices,
you know,

1913
02:03:23.741 --> 02:03:25.690
we don't hear enough of that stuff.
You know,

1914
02:03:26.050 --> 02:03:30.580
what the families are going through and missing those special times.
You know,

1915
02:03:30.581 --> 02:03:34.540
it's a
big,
big impact all the way around.

1916
02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.290
<v 0>Well,
I always try and remind people that the,</v>

1917
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:40.470
the heroes that we talk about their heroes and they're people,

1918
02:03:41.290 --> 02:03:46.290
they're people like everyone else with wives and families and they miss their,

1919
02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:48.690
their home.
They miss their family.

1920
02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:53.720
They want to be at the dance recital and the basketball game and the wrestling

1921
02:03:53.971 --> 02:03:58.080
match.
They're not just these,
you know,

1922
02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:02.430
foreign objects that just do nothing but fight man.
They're people.

1923
02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:05.400
And I always try and remind,
remind everyone of that,

1924
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:09.300
and this is a classic example here he is married his sweetheart who had met at

1925
02:04:09.301 --> 02:04:11.910
the Naval Academy.
Yeah.
Spending time with you.

1926
02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:16.860
Spending time with his family and he's leaving for Iraq 48 hours later.

1927
02:04:16.890 --> 02:04:18.340
Honeymoon and [inaudible]

1928
02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:22.700
<v 2>yeah.
Big,
big sacrifice for these guys.</v>

1929
02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:27.680
<v 0>And he does that deployment to Fallujah and</v>

1930
02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:34.260
um,
kind of,
you know,
here's,
here's a letter that he wrote home on that ms man.

1931
02:04:34.261 --> 02:04:35.870
Yeah.
And it was great seeing you guys at the wedding.

1932
02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:40.320
I'm glad you guys able to make it meant a lot to both me and Amy to see you both

1933
02:04:40.321 --> 02:04:43.770
there.
I'm doing okay over here.
Since since arriving,

1934
02:04:43.771 --> 02:04:46.020
I've been tasked with reviewing all the evils.

1935
02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:50.190
It's evaluation and awards for the command as well as work in the tactical

1936
02:04:50.191 --> 02:04:51.090
operations center.

1937
02:04:51.630 --> 02:04:56.370
I'm sure you've heard about the decreased violence out here and provincial Iraqi

1938
02:04:56.371 --> 02:05:01.080
control taking place in our long bar to see how much different it is over here.

1939
02:05:01.081 --> 02:05:05.130
Since last time is a true testament to the work that everyone over here has
done.

1940
02:05:06.150 --> 02:05:11.150
I've not had the opportunity to get out to combat outposts Mannion on a trip out

1941
02:05:11.851 --> 02:05:16.851
west to al-Assad while myself and Rob Sarver,

1942
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:20.280
another U U S Naval Academy Oh four guy who knew Travis.

1943
02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:22.530
We're waiting for our Hilo to show up.

1944
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:25.080
We struck up a conversation with a young lance corporal.

1945
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:29.820
This young marine was a Mitt team member and had mentioned that he'd just come

1946
02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:31.890
from cop Mannion.
When we heard that,

1947
02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:35.220
I let them know that Travis was a good friend of mine and a college and a

1948
02:05:35.221 --> 02:05:38.640
roommate during college.
He said that he did not know him,

1949
02:05:38.910 --> 02:05:41.190
but he'd heard great things about Travis.

1950
02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:46.560
He also said that there was a room at the cop dedicated to him with pictures.

1951
02:05:47.010 --> 02:05:50.640
I just thought you would like that story since Travis is still influencing the

1952
02:05:50.641 --> 02:05:53.070
men and women over here.
Love Brendan.

1953
02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:58.190
<v 2>Yeah,
he eventually made it out there.
Rob shared with me,
but oh,</v>

1954
02:05:58.191 --> 02:05:59.630
he made it out to cop.

1955
02:05:59.631 --> 02:06:03.620
Mannion was caught and in Fallujah or was it another session?
It was north.

1956
02:06:03.621 --> 02:06:07.750
The Karma.
Okay.
If you've ever been through Karma,
I didn't go through Karma.

1957
02:06:09.110 --> 02:06:13.030
Karma is when I was over there.
They flew me out to camp solution.

1958
02:06:13.031 --> 02:06:16.970
Then a Karma is not too far away from Camp Fallujah and it's little,

1959
02:06:17.090 --> 02:06:20.780
little north of Karma.
So the Iraqis,
um,

1960
02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:25.460
said they wanted the name the outpost after Travis,
which was,
you know,

1961
02:06:25.730 --> 02:06:29.990
again for the recognition of what he put on the line for them.

1962
02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:32.520
<v 0>Yeah.
Awesome.</v>

1963
02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:37.690
So,
but you could see from,

1964
02:06:37.691 --> 02:06:42.250
from that note that what Brendan was facing in,

1965
02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:47.140
in Felucia at that time,
even over what it would have been a six month period or,

1966
02:06:47.290 --> 02:06:48.700
or something maybe longer than that,

1967
02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:52.900
but it was completely mellow compared to what Travis wasn't during.
You know,

1968
02:06:52.930 --> 02:06:54.580
we were just way ahead at that time.

1969
02:06:54.710 --> 02:06:58.550
<v 2>Yeah.
It changed dramatically at that point for sure.</v>

1970
02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:01.790
<v 0>And so Brendan had a fairly mellow deployment,</v>

1971
02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:06.740
comes home and then goes back on deployment.
You know,
again,

1972
02:07:06.741 --> 02:07:09.770
like you just said,
new wife,
you just went on deployment.

1973
02:07:09.771 --> 02:07:12.590
Doesn't matter where sending you back in on deployment.
That's the way it works.

1974
02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:17.420
Two,
three,
four deployments.
Yup.
Yup.
Yeah.
So now we're talking,

1975
02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:20.570
he goes back this time it goes to Afghanistan.

1976
02:07:22.750 --> 02:07:24.290
It'll,
you know,
just a little bit about,

1977
02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:28.010
about Brendan's leadership with the Taliban launching its annual spring

1978
02:07:28.011 --> 02:07:31.430
offensive.
Brendan and his platoon started to see more action in May,

1979
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:36.340
just as he had predicted in his email to Tom and Janet surrounded jagged cliffs,

1980
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:40.000
extreme pop property and acute desolation,

1981
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:42.490
which many of the younger seals had never experienced.

1982
02:07:42.491 --> 02:07:46.000
It was Brendan's responsibility to keep them optimistic,
focused and sharp,

1983
02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:50.290
considering that the seals were sleeping on a fob in the middle of nowhere,

1984
02:07:50.291 --> 02:07:52.210
thousands of miles away from home.

1985
02:07:52.450 --> 02:07:55.090
Setting a positive tone was never an easy task,

1986
02:07:56.500 --> 02:07:59.380
rather than barking out orders to the seals under his command.

1987
02:07:59.650 --> 02:08:01.000
Brendan was loomed dog,

1988
02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:06.540
the unlisted seals as they loved working for the 29 year old lieutenant because

1989
02:08:08.231 --> 02:08:09.640
even though Brendan was an officer,

1990
02:08:09.730 --> 02:08:11.980
he still thought of himself as one of the boys.
So,
you know,

1991
02:08:11.981 --> 02:08:15.340
you see a very similar type of attitude.

1992
02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:19.740
<v 2>Yeah.
He's guys,
you know,
having a chance to talk to them.
They,
you know,</v>

1993
02:08:19.741 --> 02:08:23.550
everybody loved Brandon and he's just a great,
great leader,
right?

1994
02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:28.360
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
no doubt.
Like I said,
the biggest thing I remember about him,</v>

1995
02:08:28.650 --> 02:08:33.460
you know,
was no matter what I was saying to him,
not,
not an attitude,

1996
02:08:33.461 --> 02:08:36.010
but just like a positive attitude.
I'll say that.
Yeah.

1997
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:39.670
He's getting towards the end of that deployment,

1998
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:44.910
like right towards the end of that deployment and it goes back and forth.

1999
02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:49.960
Emails with Amy on Monday,

2000
02:08:49.961 --> 02:08:54.961
Amy and Brendan exchanged emails six months that Amy dreaded.

2001
02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:59.050
We're coming to a close and finally they would be living together again as

2002
02:08:59.051 --> 02:09:00.040
husband and wife.

2003
02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:04.450
Brendan could barely contain himself during his last reply before his last

2004
02:09:04.451 --> 02:09:04.900
mission.

2005
02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:09.580
Can't wait to get home and going along overdue vacation with you or call you

2006
02:09:09.581 --> 02:09:13.900
when I get back from my,
I'll love you miss you.
Me,

2007
02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.670
so they roll out on this operation.

2008
02:09:22.090 --> 02:09:26.080
Brendan's assignment in support of operation sea serpent and ongoing joint

2009
02:09:26.081 --> 02:09:31.081
anti-terror salt was to watch over the village of [inaudible] in the mountains

2010
02:09:32.771 --> 02:09:35.110
and southeastern Afghanistan province of

2011
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:36.833
<v 3>is that cool?</v>

2012
02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:41.180
<v 0>As on other tactical Overwatch missions on this one,</v>

2013
02:09:41.181 --> 02:09:45.500
Brendan and his team would serve as guardian angels much like when Travis held

2014
02:09:45.501 --> 02:09:49.670
the roof during after a Corrine attack in Falucia.

2015
02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.760
No matter what transpired in the darkness below,

2016
02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:56.270
Brendan and his seals equipped with night vision equipment would be watching

2017
02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:58.640
quiet and focused.

2018
02:09:59.210 --> 02:10:03.500
Lieutenant Brendan Looney flew above the skies of Afghanistan on the 59th combat

2019
02:10:03.501 --> 02:10:05.480
mission of his fourth overseas deployment.

2020
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:10.070
As bright moonlight shined into the chopper through the war zone soaring

2021
02:10:10.071 --> 02:10:10.904
mountains.

2022
02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:16.180
The words Spartan hero leader reflected from the Bracelet Brendan always wore on

2023
02:10:20.481 --> 02:10:24.860
his right wrist.
Moments from landing on top of a mountain,

2024
02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:29.420
the seals and soldiers aboard the chopper on hook their safety belts and prepare

2025
02:10:29.421 --> 02:10:30.254
to dismount.

2026
02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.720
Suddenly a terrible piercing sound stoned everyone to board the helicopter,

2027
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:40.310
which rapidly tumbled down a jagged steep cliff before plunging into the

2028
02:10:40.311 --> 02:10:45.270
darkness.
Frantic moments then sued were harrowing,

2029
02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:47.880
dreadful and tragic.

2030
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:55.510
<v 2>So that's Brendan's just think about it is 59th combat mission and he's two</v>

2031
02:10:58.011 --> 02:11:01.760
weeks from coming home and the new group comes in.

2032
02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:06.450
And who's the one guy that says,
you know what,
I'll go with the new guys and,

2033
02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:08.960
and show him around.
I've been at,
we've been out here the whole time.

2034
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:14.360
I don't want them going out there without anyone.
And that's Brendan Looney.
Yeah.

2035
02:11:14.690 --> 02:11:17.060
You know,
and he,
he jumps in and,

2036
02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:21.740
and a helicopter went down and only one survived.

2037
02:11:22.410 --> 02:11:26.490
<v 0>Yeah,
it's a,
it's a turnover operation is what we call it.
That's when you,</v>

2038
02:11:26.550 --> 02:11:28.500
you're taking the,
the new guys,
as you said,

2039
02:11:28.501 --> 02:11:31.980
I think these guys were from team for taking them out.
You know,
you're just,

2040
02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:34.890
you know,
one guy that,
hey,
we've done this before.

2041
02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:38.190
We'll just do a turnover and make sure you guys know what's happening and give

2042
02:11:38.191 --> 02:11:41.400
you any vice we can.
And like you said,
you're,

2043
02:11:41.490 --> 02:11:45.150
you're ready to go home.
Yeah.
And

2044
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:49.850
somebody's got to step up and do that.
Yeah.
And like you said,

2045
02:11:49.851 --> 02:11:54.380
who's going to do it?
Well,
Brendan's going to do it.
Yeah.

2046
02:11:56.210 --> 02:11:57.230
And you know,
after,

2047
02:11:57.231 --> 02:12:01.220
after Brendan was killed and you guys,

2048
02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:03.410
you know,

2049
02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:08.410
Amy Head had said she wanted Brendan to be buried next to Travis.

2050
02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:15.710
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
you,
yes.
You wonder why things happen the way they do.</v>

2051
02:12:15.711 --> 02:12:20.150
But we never had that talk with Travis.
Like,
what happens if you don't come back?

2052
02:12:21.230 --> 02:12:24.350
And when we lost him,
my wife and I were like,
well,

2053
02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:26.930
we should have him near us here at home.

2054
02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:30.590
So we burned him close by us and outside of Philadelphia.

2055
02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:35.000
And then shortly after that we heard from some found me and friends that,
hey,

2056
02:12:35.001 --> 02:12:38.060
they had a serious conversation with Travis and he said he wanted to be in

2057
02:12:38.061 --> 02:12:42.240
Arlington if anything happened to him.
So I called down to Arlington.
They said,

2058
02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:45.140
ah,
yeah,
we can,
we've reentered,
we can do that.

2059
02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:50.390
Just let us know if you want that to happen and we'll make it happen.
So,

2060
02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:54.740
um,
we never got Travis situated,
never had a headstone,

2061
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:59.300
had a wooden cross there.
And we kept talking about it,

2062
02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:04.670
you know,
and it's almost three years later and my wife was the one that was most

2063
02:13:04.671 --> 02:13:09.080
reluctant because she was visiting Travis every day and she just couldn't come

2064
02:13:09.081 --> 02:13:13.100
to grips with making that decision.
And then we get the call.

2065
02:13:13.101 --> 02:13:18.101
The first person that did Brandon's mom called was my wife Janet when she got

2066
02:13:18.171 --> 02:13:21.380
the news and we were just devastated.

2067
02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:25.370
And we got down there and Amy came into town.
She said,
you know,
I want,

2068
02:13:26.210 --> 02:13:30.080
I want Brendan next to Travis and Arlington.

2069
02:13:30.081 --> 02:13:34.100
Now she knew she at Travis Service,
she knew Travis wasn't it only to,

2070
02:13:34.101 --> 02:13:37.260
but maybe she'd forgotten in the shock.
And I know how that goes.

2071
02:13:37.261 --> 02:13:40.980
You're just in total shock.
And um,

2072
02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:45.720
at that point I could just see it in my,
my wife's eyes.
She said,
this is it.

2073
02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:48.540
This is now we need to do this.
She was ready to do it.

2074
02:13:49.050 --> 02:13:52.140
And they move mountains to make it happen.
I mean,
they,

2075
02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:56.910
department of the army and Arlington moved,

2076
02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:02.160
helped us move Travis down there in two weeks.
And,
um,

2077
02:14:02.190 --> 02:14:04.950
and then we laid Brennan that following Monday,

2078
02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:10.200
which we originally said,
let's do this the same day.
And I was like,
well,
no,

2079
02:14:10.201 --> 02:14:13.620
this is,
this is Brendan's Day would just like a quiet ceremony.

2080
02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:18.900
So we did it the Friday before and this quiet ceremony we had,

2081
02:14:18.901 --> 02:14:21.960
um,
we had all the marines from,
um,

2082
02:14:23.490 --> 02:14:26.490
from Mannion hall down at where the officer's school was.

2083
02:14:26.491 --> 02:14:30.890
They have a hall named after Travis.
They all showed up.
And of course the loony.

2084
02:14:30.891 --> 02:14:33.180
She,
you think about our service members,

2085
02:14:33.181 --> 02:14:34.630
but the strength of the families they were,

2086
02:14:34.631 --> 02:14:38.010
they insisted with all that we're going through that they were going to be over

2087
02:14:38.011 --> 02:14:40.080
there and they were there with us.

2088
02:14:41.190 --> 02:14:46.190
So we laid Travis down on that Friday and then Brendan the following Monday and

2089
02:14:46.351 --> 02:14:51.351
secretary gates was there and all his navy seals were there to pay him respects

2090
02:14:52.201 --> 02:14:55.170
and they put their tribe and it's in his,

2091
02:14:57.210 --> 02:15:02.130
you know,
his coffin.
And it was a real emotional time,
obviously,

2092
02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:05.640
and I just like a such a such a tough time.

2093
02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:14.410
<v 0>I'm going to close out the book here with the words that you spoke on the day</v>

2094
02:15:16.941 --> 02:15:21.650
that you in turn,
Travis at Arlington.

2095
02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:28.450
I want to thank the Loonie family for their presence here today.

2096
02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:34.060
Our hearts go out to you as you deal with this incredible loss.

2097
02:15:35.890 --> 02:15:39.580
Brendan represents the best this country has to offer.

2098
02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:46.460
We mourn him now and we will forever the passing of this American hero.

2099
02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:56.670
There are so many mixed emotions for us as we move Travis to this place of

2100
02:15:56.671 --> 02:15:57.504
honor.

2101
02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:02.560
Brendan's loss fills all our waking hours.

2102
02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:05.770
Yet we're moving Travis to be next to his great friend

2103
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:12.430
and together with all their warrior brothers and sisters who've paid their full

2104
02:16:14.331 --> 02:16:16.580
measure,
defending freedom.

2105
02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:23.560
This solemn place leaves us with a sadness for the sacrifices,

2106
02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:28.680
but also extremely proud of these brave Americans who so unselfishly and

2107
02:16:29.171 --> 02:16:33.940
courageously stepped forward to confront the evil that faces our world.

2108
02:16:36.410 --> 02:16:37.243
<v 1>We,</v>

2109
02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:42.870
<v 0>the families of these defenders of freedom can't begin to describe the void that</v>

2110
02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:44.020
fills our hearts.

2111
02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:50.820
But we can tell you how much our sons and daughters love this country and all

2112
02:16:51.011 --> 02:16:52.090
that it stands for.

2113
02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:56.440
We are now therefore choice.

2114
02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:03.700
So Travis,
as we lay you here today,

2115
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.140
beside your brother

2116
02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:06.553
<v 1>Brendan</v>

2117
02:17:07.330 --> 02:17:12.130
<v 0>and with all your fellow patriots,
we will always remember,</v>

2118
02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:13.350
<v 1>yeah,</v>

2119
02:17:13.350 --> 02:17:16.470
<v 0>the selfless service and sacrifice.</v>

2120
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:17.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2121
02:17:17.670 --> 02:17:21.240
<v 0>And we will continue to rally in your honor with the call,</v>

2122
02:17:21.450 --> 02:17:22.800
if not me,

2123
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:25.023
<v 1>then who?</v>

2124
02:17:27.090 --> 02:17:32.090
<v 0>To make a difference for others and to always step forward to do what's right no</v>

2125
02:17:32.761 --> 02:17:34.830
matter what the cost.

2126
02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:40.800
God bless you,
my son,

2127
02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:44.610
and rest in peace with your warrior brothers and sisters.

2128
02:17:46.850 --> 02:17:48.890
First Lieutenant Travis Mannion,

2129
02:17:50.850 --> 02:17:52.360
United States Marine Corps.

2130
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:56.470
<v 1>We tried to Brendan Looney.
Okay.</v>

2131
02:17:56.710 --> 02:17:57.970
<v 0>United States Navy</v>

2132
02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:04.880
warriors for freedom
brothers

2133
02:18:06.490 --> 02:18:07.323
<v 1>forever.</v>

2134
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:13.833
<v 2>Yeah.
So you,</v>

2135
02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:18.840
when you think about section 60 and all the loss there and you know,

2136
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:22.030
symbolically there,
Brendan and Travis,

2137
02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:27.600
great friends and they're side by side and Arlington native,

2138
02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:31.300
if you're ever there,
you know,
when I'm out talking to people I say,
you know,

2139
02:18:31.301 --> 02:18:34.780
if you don't,
if you haven't taken your family that Armington put it on the list,

2140
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:36.280
you're in DC or,

2141
02:18:36.281 --> 02:18:41.281
or make a special trip to DC to go see Arlington and teach your family about

2142
02:18:42.821 --> 02:18:47.821
that sacrifice and make sure you go to section 60 where all those heroes of

2143
02:18:48.221 --> 02:18:50.290
today have Iraq and Afghanistan are,

2144
02:18:50.710 --> 02:18:53.560
is always something that's just happening in section 60

2145
02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:57.640
and after that,
that,
uh,

2146
02:18:57.730 --> 02:19:02.730
September when we moved Travis in that following a following spring,

2147
02:19:02.981 --> 02:19:05.830
the navy seals found and killed Osama bin Ladin.

2148
02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:12.120
And then a couple of weeks later the president spoke about Travis and Brendan as

2149
02:19:12.851 --> 02:19:16.120
an example for the country in Arlington and his Memorial Day address.

2150
02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:21.410
We were down there with the loonies to hear that.
But again,
their,

2151
02:19:21.411 --> 02:19:25.420
their story is a story that could be anybody's story.

2152
02:19:25.570 --> 02:19:30.050
There's so many in uniform do so much.
And for me,

2153
02:19:30.051 --> 02:19:31.310
writing this book is,

2154
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:36.170
is telling their story but making sure it's part of that bigger story and that

2155
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:40.820
people appreciate our men and when I'm in uniform and all they are and what they

2156
02:19:40.821 --> 02:19:41.654
stand for.

2157
02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:46.310
<v 0>Well it's a,
it's an amazing story and Travis is still</v>

2158
02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:52.490
doing good right now with his name it and you know,

2159
02:19:52.491 --> 02:19:57.260
you guys started the Travis Manion foundation.
Tell us a little bit about that.

2160
02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:02.690
<v 2>Well,
you know,
as I shared earlier,
you know,</v>

2161
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:06.220
we wanted to make sure we made an impact him and we got the word out and,
and,

2162
02:20:06.221 --> 02:20:08.170
and part of that was my wife said,
you know,

2163
02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:12.220
I'm going to start a foundation and I want it to be there for our veterans,

2164
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:17.350
make sure I'm supporting the families of the fallen.
And the last part of it was,

2165
02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:22.330
was making sure that we do something to support that next generational leaders.

2166
02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:25.330
So she started a character program.

2167
02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:29.500
Character does matter where we get veterans in front of young kids and talk

2168
02:20:29.501 --> 02:20:34.501
about character and service and integrity and leadership.

2169
02:20:36.730 --> 02:20:38.530
And you know,
my wife started that.

2170
02:20:38.531 --> 02:20:41.770
We had good friends that were there when we lost Travis.
They said,
you know what,

2171
02:20:42.190 --> 02:20:45.670
you guys should set up a memorial fund in lieu of flowers.

2172
02:20:46.660 --> 02:20:49.900
And we did that.
And before we knew it,

2173
02:20:49.930 --> 02:20:53.200
when we turned around and looked at the bank account,

2174
02:20:53.350 --> 02:20:57.610
we had money coming in from all over the country and we had $200,000 my wife had

2175
02:20:57.611 --> 02:21:01.870
$200,000 and she had those five words from Travis,

2176
02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:03.340
if not me,
than who.

2177
02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:07.690
And she got going with that with those two things.

2178
02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:12.820
And she came in every day first started right our kitchen and started working
it.

2179
02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:18.580
And you know,
she worked at too,
when we lost her,
lost Janet,
five years,

2180
02:21:18.581 --> 02:21:22.870
almost five years to the day after Travis with lost my wife to cancer.

2181
02:21:23.650 --> 02:21:25.420
And it gets you,
you know,
you think about that,

2182
02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:28.120
that sacrifice and the impact on the families.

2183
02:21:28.121 --> 02:21:32.390
And I remember doing some research after we found out she had cancer and said as

2184
02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:36.370
she had a significant stressful event in the last four to five years.

2185
02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:41.050
Yeah.
You know,
she lost her son.
And we think about that.

2186
02:21:41.051 --> 02:21:46.051
And then you think about Brendan's mom who recently died of cancer or JP

2187
02:21:46.781 --> 02:21:49.360
blacksmiths,
mom who died of cancer,
you know,

2188
02:21:49.361 --> 02:21:54.361
so the impact is significant across the board for our families and our,

2189
02:21:55.870 --> 02:22:00.580
our guys and gals in uniform.
So we got going on that and,

2190
02:22:00.581 --> 02:22:05.110
and my daughter's picked it up since and she's doing a great job with that.

2191
02:22:05.111 --> 02:22:07.450
She's working with a lot of,
a lot of great young people.

2192
02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:11.890
Amy loonies and other one of the leaders of the foundation and she heads up

2193
02:22:12.460 --> 02:22:16.570
operations in Washington DC.
We've got an office here in San Diego.

2194
02:22:17.310 --> 02:22:21.280
Uh,
we've got one we just opened up in Atlanta where outside of Philadelphia,

2195
02:22:21.281 --> 02:22:22.180
Washington.

2196
02:22:22.270 --> 02:22:25.800
We're getting ready to open up an office in Chicago and we've got an in Houston,

2197
02:22:25.801 --> 02:22:26.634
Texas.

2198
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:30.450
And we're working with our veterans in and helping them through transition,

2199
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:34.260
working with the families.
And you,
you asked before is this,

2200
02:22:34.290 --> 02:22:39.290
was this somewhat telling this story a little bit therapeutic and you know,

2201
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:43.650
doing this foundation and,
and pushing that forward,

2202
02:22:43.651 --> 02:22:48.090
was that therapeutic and um,
you know,
we really believe it is,
you know,

2203
02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:50.100
and we believe,
you know,
he,
there's a grieving period,

2204
02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:55.320
but we know that Travis would not want us to keep grieving.

2205
02:22:56.100 --> 02:23:00.440
He'd want us to say,
hey,
let's go,
you know,
pick it up and get out there and,

2206
02:23:00.810 --> 02:23:05.730
and do something and make a difference.
And so we,
we do that,

2207
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:06.060
you know,

2208
02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:08.850
that's what we do every day and we give some of the families chance to do that

2209
02:23:08.851 --> 02:23:09.240
too.

2210
02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:14.240
We get families that go out and go on expeditions and help those that are in

2211
02:23:14.701 --> 02:23:19.701
need build houses and it's really great for them.

2212
02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:20.090
You know,

2213
02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:23.310
it's great to see them out there doing something and honor the last one,

2214
02:23:23.370 --> 02:23:26.040
love one and making an impact for others.

2215
02:23:26.110 --> 02:23:29.470
<v 5>What's the best way for people to support,</v>

2216
02:23:29.471 --> 02:23:33.340
where can they find out information about the Travis Manion foundation?

2217
02:23:33.790 --> 02:23:36.910
<v 2>Yeah,
they can go on our website,
Travis Manion.
Dot work.
Okay.</v>

2218
02:23:37.060 --> 02:23:41.980
Got a lot of information there were around the country doing different things.

2219
02:23:41.981 --> 02:23:46.810
We've got offices in some locations,
but we've got activities almost everywhere.

2220
02:23:47.710 --> 02:23:51.970
And um,
for us it's about joining the,
if not me,
then who movement,
you know,

2221
02:23:51.971 --> 02:23:53.560
making a difference wherever you can.

2222
02:23:53.561 --> 02:23:57.730
And you can do that in a lot of different ways.
That's awesome.

2223
02:23:58.440 --> 02:23:59.273
Um,

2224
02:24:00.980 --> 02:24:01.760
<v 3>okay.</v>

2225
02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:05.210
<v 5>Echo.
Speaking of supporting things,
sure.</v>

2226
02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:09.380
If someone wanted to support,
let's say for instance,
this podcast,

2227
02:24:09.470 --> 02:24:13.300
how would they do that?
Well,
a few weeks.
Let me see.

2228
02:24:14.570 --> 02:24:19.510
I'm going to make this one a whole long spiel,
but you know,

2229
02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:21.530
we'll start with on it.
That's a good way.

2230
02:24:21.531 --> 02:24:23.330
That's a good way to support yourself too,
by the way,

2231
02:24:23.810 --> 02:24:26.930
which I think we already know,
but get on it.

2232
02:24:28.730 --> 02:24:33.350
These are supplements.
There's other other stuff to work out stuff and whatnot.

2233
02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:38.300
But uh,
anyway,
go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko is 10% off.

2234
02:24:38.310 --> 02:24:40.550
Gag on Twitter was asking me.
Oh,
what?

2235
02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:45.500
I think he was asking both of us what are like some supplements too?

2236
02:24:47.410 --> 02:24:52.070
Gain muscle,
lose fat
burpees.
Yes.

2237
02:24:52.130 --> 02:24:56.260
See He will see that answer though.
It wasn't a supplement,
you know,
he was like,

2238
02:24:56.261 --> 02:24:59.630
what are the best?
And that's what I thought too.
It's not the supplements,
right.

2239
02:24:59.890 --> 02:25:02.950
It's like you got to get on the correct workout,
right.
To do that.

2240
02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:04.510
Supplements help though.

2241
02:25:04.990 --> 02:25:08.260
And it's going to take certain supplements for whatever results.
So anyway,

2242
02:25:10.010 --> 02:25:11.260
to answer that question,

2243
02:25:11.290 --> 02:25:16.290
get on a muscle building fat loss workout metcons and I hate to say it,

2244
02:25:19.991 --> 02:25:22.930
but like a bodybuilding routine.
You love saying that.
You don't hate to say it.

2245
02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:27.830
Yeah.
Well in front of you.
I kind of hate to say it cause the leukemia talking to

2246
02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:32.230
see Tom knows.
Yup.

2247
02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:36.580
But the supplements will help and like we always say the Krill oil you get on

2248
02:25:36.581 --> 02:25:40.690
the Krill oil re cause good.
Yeah.
You know,

2249
02:25:40.750 --> 02:25:43.510
so long time ago,
my father in law,
he,

2250
02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:46.960
he would always tell my wife though Krill,
it's good for your joints.

2251
02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:51.470
It will maintain your and lifting like Krill oil.
Where's the,
you know,

2252
02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:54.340
where's a protein powder,
tight attic to even,
actually,

2253
02:25:54.341 --> 02:25:56.560
I'd never really was into supplements,
but I was like,

2254
02:25:56.561 --> 02:26:00.360
why would I need the Krill oil I'm looking for,
for Gans?
Let's face it.

2255
02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:05.380
Exactly right.
You know,
I mean,
respect.
I'm the Krill oil,
you know,

2256
02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:09.280
obviously my father in law is older than me and so I get it,
but you know,

2257
02:26:09.281 --> 02:26:13.330
you don't have to indirectly tell me about it,
man.

2258
02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:14.950
I wish I just would have listened to him.
You know?

2259
02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:19.370
It keeps you in the game way longer.
Way Better.
Anyway,
get on the Krill oil vice.

2260
02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:23.950
Yeah,
you've got to get them.
Yeah,
right.
How can you not really,

2261
02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.290
I said do it.
Yeah,
get on that.
Pardon the pun on it yet on that,
on it,

2262
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:33.430
on [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko get 10% off of anything you get on there.

2263
02:26:33.431 --> 02:26:34.870
There's some good stuff on there by the way.

2264
02:26:34.871 --> 02:26:38.260
You can get addicted to the website itself because it's so interesting and

2265
02:26:38.261 --> 02:26:42.970
informative
if you like.
Um,
interesting and informative.

2266
02:26:43.090 --> 02:26:47.590
I didn't say it like this.
You didn't know.
I didn't pretty much again,
no comment.

2267
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:52.810

2287
02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:07.000
There was a lot of controversy when we first put it on youtube because echo

2288
02:28:07.001 --> 02:28:10.540
doesn't look like what he sounds like apparently.

2289
02:28:10.541 --> 02:28:14.830
He sounds like a hipster 15 year old hipster hipster.

2290
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:19.030
How something.
Yeah,
something more along little.

2291
02:28:19.031 --> 02:28:22.140
Did they know that?
I mean until they saw him,
Huh?

2292
02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:28.020
Then they figured out is it a 20 year old is
yeah,
I know man.

2293
02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:32.330
Dang.
But yeah,
you know,
if you're interested in that kind of stuff.
Um,

2294
02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:35.120
but the excerpts really are helpful because you can share them and people will

2295
02:28:35.121 --> 02:28:38.180
actually watch them.
Like my brother sends me this,
actually,

2296
02:28:38.181 --> 02:28:40.910
you know what I was about to say this like maybe two,
three times ago,

2297
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.590
but I ended up,
for whatever reason that's like,

2298
02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:47.360
jade will send me a video and be like,
Hey,
watch this.
And then I'll be like,

2299
02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:51.620
Bro,
I'm not going to watch this video right now.
It's like five,
10 minutes long.

2300
02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:55.870
Actually it was like nine minutes,
something too much,
too much for me.
And He,

2301
02:28:55.871 --> 02:28:58.970
and the thing is nine minutes.
That's not that long.
But the point still stands.

2302
02:28:58.971 --> 02:29:03.971
You can't just send somebody episode 72 of this podcast that's almost three

2303
02:29:06.321 --> 02:29:08.950
hours long as say,
hey,
watch this real quick.
You can't do that.
Right.

2304
02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:12.160
It's not a quick one.
Exactly right.
Especially if it,
you know,
it,

2305
02:29:12.161 --> 02:29:15.830
especially if it's just that one little part of that they want I light.
Yeah.

2306
02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:19.790
Excerpts of usually highlights himself and just include my,

2307
02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:24.850
you know,
echo with another amazing point.
Yeah.

2308
02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:28.670
Well yeah man,
you know,
so yeah,
the all that's on youtube.

2309
02:29:28.671 --> 02:29:31.790
I even put them in little play lists too.
So you know,
some people that are like,

2310
02:29:31.791 --> 02:29:34.200
Hey,
I like this point and then I'll lead you to the next point.
And you know,

2311
02:29:34.201 --> 02:29:38.380
you can kind of keep it going.
Um,
but yeah.
That's cool.
I think it's cool.
Anyway,

2312
02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:40.520
also,
jock has a store,

2313
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:45.530
it's called Jocko store Jocko store.com and look for the,
for this website.

2314
02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:47.270
Really it's a website with the store.

2315
02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:52.720
And I put those wallpapers back on there or your phone thing is,

2316
02:29:53.841 --> 02:29:56.810
I didn't technically,
I didn't take them off is when we switched platforms,

2317
02:29:56.811 --> 02:30:01.550
they just failed to translate.
So it was the platform's fault,

2318
02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:06.460
not yours.
No extreme.
This ownership on that one.
And you know,

2319
02:30:06.530 --> 02:30:11.250
I blame tech on that CT over there.
Dig It.
Oh,
we're going to get to that.

2320
02:30:12.260 --> 02:30:14.750
Yeah.
That's on the,
on the [inaudible] dot com.
Yeah,

2321
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:18.060
you can get the Jocko white tea on there through there.
Um,

2322
02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:22.010
if you like t shirts,
those are on their

2323
02:30:23.810 --> 02:30:25.070
discipline equals freedom.

2324
02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:31.300
The reason I think that that's a good shirt might be opinion is because of

2325
02:30:32.241 --> 02:30:33.680
course the layers.
I get it.

2326
02:30:34.130 --> 02:30:37.460
But it is one of those simple little things like it's not,

2327
02:30:37.461 --> 02:30:41.570
and it's not like too extreme either.
It's not like
echo.

2328
02:30:41.571 --> 02:30:42.530
When we designed this shirt,

2329
02:30:42.531 --> 02:30:47.531
echo wanted to put a flying tank with dragon fire coming out of its mouth and a

2330
02:30:48.351 --> 02:30:53.060
scarf and a skull.
Yeah.
He's gonna put it all over the whole face,
all over.

2331
02:30:53.860 --> 02:30:57.620
See.
And I'd be like too much.
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.
So,
or you know,

2332
02:30:57.621 --> 02:31:02.520
like a saying like all eat your kids for breakfast.

2333
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:06.350
If you mess with me and are those time kinds of crazy sayings that will only hit

2334
02:31:06.351 --> 02:31:09.840
maybe like one out of 100 times.
You know,
when someone reads it,
it's not that,

2335
02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:17.270
gosh,
you not with any of them laugh.
I don't think so.

2336
02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:22.800
But this is equals equals.
It's,
it's for lack of a better term,

2337
02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:27.090
understated yet powerful.
That's my opinion.
Anyway.

2338
02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:30.580
Other shorts down there,
um,
you know,
various,
uh,

2339
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:33.510
messages and with those messages come layers.

2340
02:31:33.511 --> 02:31:37.740
And what that means is you can look at it and be like,
okay,
that's a cool shirt,

2341
02:31:37.890 --> 02:31:40.980
but there's more to it.
So if you listen to this podcast or listening to Jackie,

2342
02:31:40.981 --> 02:31:43.940
you'll be like,
oh,
I get it.
Right.
I mean,
yeah,
okay.

2343
02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:48.750
There's more than just what's on the surface.
There's another lane.
Yes,

2344
02:31:48.751 --> 02:31:51.560
exactly right.
You listen,
you know,
um,

2345
02:31:51.570 --> 02:31:54.180
some rash guards on their new rash guards going to come out in

2346
02:31:55.610 --> 02:31:57.500
less than one week.
Also,

2347
02:31:59.030 --> 02:32:01.130
good way to support this podcast.

2348
02:32:01.850 --> 02:32:06.710
Very good way to support yourself in your journey
journey.

2349
02:32:06.711 --> 02:32:10.940
Or we do.
Do people still use the word journey?
Your word man,
go with it.

2350
02:32:10.970 --> 02:32:13.070
I never feel comfortable using the word journey.

2351
02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:17.280
It says you weren't going anywhere.
I don't,

2352
02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:21.470
it goes get out of the actual journey.
But you know,

2353
02:32:21.471 --> 02:32:23.540
it's one of those things that you kind of hear people saying.

2354
02:32:23.550 --> 02:32:27.080
It kind of sounds epic,
but then when you say it,
it sounds real stupid.

2355
02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:30.870
I felt like the word journey is kind of like,
oh,
anyway.
Yeah.
All right.

2356
02:32:30.890 --> 02:32:34.730
If you're on your journey to what?
Get up early,

2357
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:39.110
be more disciplined,
get a better diet.
Just get your health together.

2358
02:32:39.111 --> 02:32:43.430
Get your whole thing together.
This is what will help you there.

2359
02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:47.570
Okay,
so on this journey,
it's not going to be,

2360
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:50.420
you're not going to be hitting every day like killing every day.

2361
02:32:50.421 --> 02:32:52.700
You're going to have some days going to be harder than others.

2362
02:32:53.390 --> 02:32:56.060
So if you're having trouble,
for example,

2363
02:32:57.460 --> 02:33:00.430
waking up early one day is what you're going to do.

2364
02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:03.040
You're going to search psychological warfare,

2365
02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:07.500
Jocko Willink on iTunes or Amazon music.
Okay.

2366
02:33:07.501 --> 02:33:10.420
So it's this album with tracks and you put it on your phone,

2367
02:33:10.421 --> 02:33:14.710
whatever you listen to the track that's going to help you get out of bed.

2368
02:33:14.711 --> 02:33:18.730
That one's called wake up.
What's it called?
Wake up.
Get after,

2369
02:33:18.731 --> 02:33:22.090
wake up and get after it.
Boom.
So instead of,
uh,

2370
02:33:22.180 --> 02:33:26.740
instead of hitting the snooze,
you hit or put it as your ringtone,

2371
02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:29.710
clear it with your wife or whoever you sleep with,
but put it as your ringtone.

2372
02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:34.360
It's Jockos voice.
He'll tell you why you should wake up and get after it.

2373
02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:39.460
And you,
that's convincing.
It is.
You did.
So I,
I mean we,

2374
02:33:40.090 --> 02:33:44.770
there was like one year we've had an,
I don't sit in this 100% success rate.

2375
02:33:45.310 --> 02:33:46.143
There's one guy,

2376
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:49.060
because there's actually three jacks to wake up the first one to wake up the

2377
02:33:49.061 --> 02:33:51.730
second tech.
What did you just do?
You didn't get out of bed.

2378
02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:55.060
There's one guy out of a lot of people that have,

2379
02:33:55.090 --> 02:33:58.570
has made it to the second track.
Everyone else's first track word.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2380
02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:03.790
So you can't,
you can't not get up.
And again,
that's a rare case.

2381
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.110
You know that guy,

2382
02:34:05.590 --> 02:34:10.090
he probably had a really hard night the night before looking into or looking

2383
02:34:10.091 --> 02:34:11.950
forward to really,
really hard day.

2384
02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:16.610
And that's why he was considering training wheels,
right?
Yeah.
And the whales,

2385
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:20.650
it a spa.
I like spot.
Yeah,
it's better.
Yeah.

2386
02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:24.390
Training wheels kind of seems like without it you fall down.
You know,

2387
02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:27.600
this is just for,
you know,
if I'm trying to get that Max on bench,

2388
02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:31.720
this is the how.
This is a big goal I've got now.
I want to wake up for one year,

2389
02:34:31.721 --> 02:34:33.340
I'm going to wake up early or something like this.

2390
02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:37.660
It's like if I have a huge goal with the bench all I'm going to get it,

2391
02:34:37.661 --> 02:34:38.770
I'll probably get it.

2392
02:34:38.980 --> 02:34:42.400
But in the small case that let's say I'm not strong enough today,

2393
02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:45.410
I didn't get enough sleep or whatever,
I got a spot there.
Boom.
Yeah.

2394
02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:49.060
Then I'll get it.
Same thing,
same exact thing.
So yeah,
there it is.

2395
02:34:49.061 --> 02:34:53.410
Psychological warfare and this goes for,
for waking up early skipping workouts.

2396
02:34:53.411 --> 02:34:56.620
That's a big one in my opinion,
skipping workouts.
But that's just my experience.

2397
02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:59.740
And somebody asked me what was it?
What?

2398
02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:05.170
What do you say to yourself when you get tired and you want to quit?

2399
02:35:06.190 --> 02:35:09.250
You don't want to do anything anymore?
And I said,
I don't say anything to myself.

2400
02:35:09.251 --> 02:35:12.310
I just keep doing it.
Next question.

2401
02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:17.800
See what that is.
That's that menu set.
You know,
if you're on auto,
you're like,

2402
02:35:17.801 --> 02:35:19.600
what am I feel like?
Do we know if you're like not doing,

2403
02:35:19.601 --> 02:35:22.390
if I feel like I want to quit,
you just going to kind of sort of quick,

2404
02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:27.520
automatically no.
Namaste.
Take control.
Yup.
Exactly right.

2405
02:35:28.090 --> 02:35:32.050
So yeah,
boom.
There's a good psychological warfare.
Jocko Willink.

2406
02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:33.910
It's good for waking up early.

2407
02:35:33.940 --> 02:35:36.460
If you have a day that you don't want to wake up or you're going to slip on your

2408
02:35:36.461 --> 02:35:39.220
diet,
let's face it,
we come home,
we're hungry.

2409
02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:43.060
Nothing's in the house except for some donuts.
Oh,
snap.

2410
02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:46.630
The chance of you eating the donuts goes up a little bit.
Let's just face it.

2411
02:35:46.631 --> 02:35:50.620
Actually a lot supporting.
Exactly right.
That first.

2412
02:35:50.621 --> 02:35:51.790
I shouldn't have done it in your house.

2413
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:54.340
But if you do in the event of you having done this,
yes,

2414
02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:58.990
listen to psychological warfare,
sugarcoated lies,
that's the name,
snack time and,

2415
02:35:59.270 --> 02:36:04.270
and the psychological warfare album number two is being slowly prepared at this

2416
02:36:06.041 --> 02:36:10.150
point.
It's,
it's Bruce,
people were asking me for specific tracks,

2417
02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.430
little areas of weakness in life,

2418
02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:17.500
you know a also Jocko white tea and you can get it on amazon.com after you click

2419
02:36:19.331 --> 02:36:20.164
through,

2420
02:36:20.410 --> 02:36:25.410
if you don't want to deadlift in excess of 8,000 pounds,

2421
02:36:26.050 --> 02:36:26.883
don't get it.

2422
02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:31.390
Get a different kind of tea if you want to deadlift 8,000 pounds guaranteed.

2423
02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:33.940
Good Jocko white tea.
Cause that's what it does.

2424
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:38.940
It does taste good though in all seriousness.
And I got to get some of that.

2425
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:44.770
I think we have any here we give you some age limit on that or what?
No,
no,
no,

2426
02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:49.390
we are,
I do have to give you a heads up.
There is,
we haven't done it yet,

2427
02:36:49.391 --> 02:36:52.600
but we're gonna have to put some kind of a fertility warning on there as well

2428
02:36:52.601 --> 02:36:57.601
because apparently several drinkers have impregnated their wives shortly after

2429
02:36:58.361 --> 02:37:00.850
drinking Jocko white tea from unplanned.

2430
02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:04.840
Just gotta be careful is that w which is discipline equals freedom on the other

2431
02:37:04.841 --> 02:37:09.770
side or sort of
that,
you know what I mean?
Got gotta.
Yes,

2432
02:37:09.790 --> 02:37:10.630
exactly.

2433
02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:15.010
He need do you need to heat that with your loved one?

2434
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:16.543
Uh,

2435
02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:20.900
<v 0>way the war your kid gets when it's available now,
now</v>

2436
02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:27.170
order it.
Amazon's going to start pre shifting it in in a day or two,

2437
02:37:27.470 --> 02:37:29.870
so get ahead of the rush.

2438
02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:35.320
Get it while you can because otherwise it's you're not going to get it and all

2439
02:37:35.421 --> 02:37:40.421
the other kids are going to be destroying your dreams with their strength and

2440
02:37:40.701 --> 02:37:41.534
power.

2441
02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:46.520

You got anything else?
We'll wait.

2472
02:39:46.690 --> 02:39:50.830
<v 2>Travis wrestle that.
He's one 84 and navy.</v>

2473
02:39:51.310 --> 02:39:55.570
So what did he walk around at like two 15?
You know the guys get better.

2474
02:39:55.571 --> 02:39:58.120
Wrestlers cut weight,
cutting a lot of weight there.

2475
02:39:58.810 --> 02:40:03.640
He's probably bad to 10 to 15.
He's big guy.
That's still a lot of weight.

2476
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:04.960
That's a horse right there.

2477
02:40:06.610 --> 02:40:10.660
The big guys at one 84 college wrestler.
Oh yeah,
for sure.
For sure.

2478
02:40:11.530 --> 02:40:14.100
All out.
Battle like injuries.

2479
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:18.420
<v 0>Yeah.
Tough,
tough.
Warn us.
Seems like the most,
um,</v>

2480
02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:20.570
I don't want to say dynamic,
but the most like,

2481
02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:25.170
you know how you'd get heavyweights?
Huge power,
but they start to slow down.

2482
02:40:25.290 --> 02:40:29.370
Lightweight.
They're flying around super technical,
but they don't have that,

2483
02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:31.890
you know what I mean?
That part of then the one 80 fours.

2484
02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:36.900
The middle weights are tough.
They're really tough.
Yeah,
they got,
yeah,

2485
02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:41.430
they got both battles,
some bs in there.
Respect.
Thank you.

2486
02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:45.840
Thank you.
Echo.
Do you have any,
uh,
any,
any closing?
Closing comments?

2487
02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:49.440
<v 2>Yeah.
Well I just,
um,
I want to thank you guys.</v>

2488
02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:54.630
Thanks Jocko and echo for having me here and giving me the opportunity to talk

2489
02:40:54.631 --> 02:40:58.050
about the story a little bit and thanks for what you guys do to,

2490
02:40:58.490 --> 02:41:03.490
to talk about leadership and the lessons that you've learned Jocko and in the

2491
02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:09.291
navy seals and sharing that with others and bring in new insights about our men

2492
02:41:11.401 --> 02:41:12.750
and women in uniform.
I mean,

2493
02:41:12.751 --> 02:41:17.751
you hear so much these days about the troubles that our service members have,

2494
02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:23.970
you know,
whether they're missing a limb,
they don't have a job,
they've got PTSD.

2495
02:41:23.971 --> 02:41:28.290
But you know,
we,
we also should be talking about is what an inspiration they are.

2496
02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:30.390
The guys who put on the uniform,

2497
02:41:30.391 --> 02:41:34.320
the men and women have put on the uniform are an inspiration for this country.

2498
02:41:34.321 --> 02:41:37.830
And,
and thanks for what you're doing to get the word out there.

2499
02:41:37.831 --> 02:41:40.320
Thanks for giving me the opportunity to talk about this book,

2500
02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:45.620
but more broadly the story of our men and women in uniform and how they live

2501
02:41:46.081 --> 02:41:50.310
every day.
With that,
if not me,
then who motto.
Thanks

2502
02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:53.580
<v 0>absolute honor,
sir.
And you know,</v>

2503
02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:57.990
sort of one more thing before we close out.
I know you,
you,

2504
02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:01.530
you were talking about a letter that you had that kind of talked about some of

2505
02:42:01.531 --> 02:42:03.890
the leadership principles that

2506
02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:10.400
we really learn in the military and really make military leaders excel.

2507
02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:15.030
And it's a letter that you got from one of the marines that,

2508
02:42:15.330 --> 02:42:17.810
that work for your son.
Did

2509
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:20.870
<v 2>Christine that I'd do,
you know,</v>

2510
02:42:20.871 --> 02:42:25.871
here I am coming out to talk to you and I've had the book published for a couple

2511
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:28.040
of years now,
but I just,
I just got this letter.

2512
02:42:29.290 --> 02:42:29.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2513
02:42:29.490 --> 02:42:33.930
<v 2>Uh,
through coach Garrett,
you talked about coach Sheraton and now this,</v>

2514
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:38.610
this marine that was with my son,
served with my son,
hooked up with coach,

2515
02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:42.780
showered at one of the wrestling events and said,
hey,
you know,
colonel man,

2516
02:42:42.781 --> 02:42:43.650
you'd give him this letter.

2517
02:42:44.910 --> 02:42:45.100
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2518
02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:49.450
<v 2>And,
um,
you know,
here he is checking in uh,</v>

2519
02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:53.550
after 10 years and he says,
um,

2520
02:42:56.930 --> 02:42:57.763
<v 1>okay,</v>

2521
02:42:57.870 --> 02:43:00.270
<v 2>things he'd like to share with me.
A couple of things,</v>

2522
02:43:00.271 --> 02:43:04.110
things that are not well known by people other than those in my myself that

2523
02:43:04.111 --> 02:43:05.640
serve with Travis and Fallujah,

2524
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:09.450
those memories or things I'm able to hold on to,

2525
02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:12.220
but I've been wanting to share with his family as well.

2526
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:14.620
I apologize for such a long silence.

2527
02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:20.760
It seems to be the best opportunity for me to share them with you by passing

2528
02:43:21.191 --> 02:43:26.110
along this letter
and he actually passed along the bracelet.

2529
02:43:26.111 --> 02:43:29.350
He had Travis's name on a bracelet he'd worn for the past 10 years,

2530
02:43:29.351 --> 02:43:32.320
especially as he says with 10 year anniversary coming up.

2531
02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:38.260
He talked about your,
the backstory is from Columbus,
Ohio.

2532
02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:44.520
He joined Lima company then meant Travis and the rest of the marines in January,

2533
02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:49.030
2007 as they rotated into work with the Iraqi army counterparts

2534
02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:54.310
at the time,
I hit my two year mark in the core,

2535
02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:59.760
but in not yet have an opportunity to work with a true leader with so many with

2536
02:44:01.031 --> 02:44:04.270
so few marines assigned to the mid team,
Travis was my team leader.

2537
02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:08.350
Travis was a true leader and someone that was easy for me to look up to and

2538
02:44:08.351 --> 02:44:08.861
respect.

2539
02:44:08.861 --> 02:44:13.330
He had the perfect balance of caring for his marines without babying them.

2540
02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:18.340
Discipline,
without being too harsh,
being laid back.

2541
02:44:18.341 --> 02:44:21.490
We're not involved in missions while standing.

2542
02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:25.660
We'll still leading from the front and once it got time to get the work done and

2543
02:44:25.661 --> 02:44:26.650
we talked about that

2544
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:32.980
as I progress through my military career,

2545
02:44:32.981 --> 02:44:34.810
Travis was the leader that I strive to be.

2546
02:44:35.890 --> 02:44:38.980
Your son said the example of how a leader should be.

2547
02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:44.140
I read the book and enjoyed learning more about him as a man,
not just a marine.

2548
02:44:44.170 --> 02:44:48.490
I also enjoyed getting to know Brendan and they're incredibly,

2549
02:44:48.491 --> 02:44:49.510
where our friendship,

2550
02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:54.550
it made it easy for me to connect how he was as a person back home and how he

2551
02:44:54.551 --> 02:44:57.280
was raised.
So he said I wanted to share two stories,

2552
02:44:57.281 --> 02:45:01.330
so I hit the highlights of this.
But first story

2553
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:07.120
he found kind of humorous and you've talked about Travis having a sense of
humor.

2554
02:45:07.121 --> 02:45:10.320
So here you go.
It's February.
Uh,

2555
02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:15.220
there were out the patrol turn out to be uneventful for the most part until they

2556
02:45:15.250 --> 02:45:18.070
started returned to the outpost.
As they return,

2557
02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:22.960
they were returning an IED.
It was initiated.
Is She initiated?

2558
02:45:22.961 --> 02:45:24.070
An ambush started.

2559
02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:29.440
Thankfully the ID IED did not detonate the artillery shell.
It was attached to,

2560
02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:33.790
but the only,
but only the blasting cap and knows of the shell blue.

2561
02:45:34.270 --> 02:45:35.530
This injured his soldier

2562
02:45:37.630 --> 02:45:41.680
and another Iraqi soldier was shot while rushing to the aid.

2563
02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:45.490
Both were non life threatening.
Once the ambush start,

2564
02:45:45.491 --> 02:45:48.970
I began writing radioing back to request Qfr.

2565
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:51.310
Although Travis was not on the patrol,

2566
02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:56.700
he managed to find a way to get on the Qfr two QRF team as a short and Bush

2567
02:45:57.791 --> 02:46:02.380
subsided.
The QRF showed up.
Travis's presence,

2568
02:46:02.381 --> 02:46:02.860
calm.

2569
02:46:02.860 --> 02:46:07.860
Any nerves that I had the injured Iraqi had already taken back to receive

2570
02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:09.124
treatment.

2571
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:14.150
What I remember most about the situation was that tribes always about Travis.

2572
02:46:14.151 --> 02:46:15.530
That brings a smile on my face.

2573
02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:19.130
I was standing on the north side of the road and Travis was on the south.

2574
02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:24.350
I remember he began to cross the road and a job just as an Iraqi soldier let out

2575
02:46:24.351 --> 02:46:28.490
of burst from is eight k to the east to stop a vehicle from approaching.

2576
02:46:29.090 --> 02:46:30.500
As soon as the burst went off,

2577
02:46:30.501 --> 02:46:35.300
Travis tripped across the road doing a barrel roll and coming back to his feet

2578
02:46:35.301 --> 02:46:36.890
with his helmet,
push back on his head.

2579
02:46:38.390 --> 02:46:40.760
As soon as he reached me on the north side of the road,
he said,

2580
02:46:40.761 --> 02:46:45.680
is everybody okay over here?
I've replied,
yes sir.
Everyone is okay.

2581
02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:49.640
Are you okay,
sir?
To which he responded.
Yeah,

2582
02:46:49.641 --> 02:46:51.860
but somebody should get that pothole fixed

2583
02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:57.090
and a near death experience for me.
This uh,

2584
02:46:57.230 --> 02:47:01.400
laughter as my leader had been startled by an Iraqi army.

2585
02:47:01.401 --> 02:47:04.700
One he shot causing the form bowel roll in the middle of Iraqi street.

2586
02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:08.930
So having that sense of humor,
right,
being able to laugh at yourself.

2587
02:47:08.931 --> 02:47:13.670
And then the other story shared is,
is is about this guy's birthday.

2588
02:47:13.671 --> 02:47:15.950
My second story,
Travis is more sentimental.

2589
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:21.730
My birthday is April 3rd and I'm turning 21 that night.
We all slayed it,

2590
02:47:21.731 --> 02:47:25.730
were slated for overnight observation,
searching for possible ids,

2591
02:47:26.450 --> 02:47:28.760
but I've been pulled from the mission to remain behind.

2592
02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:33.450
I thought nothing of it and went to bed on the second ready to be on the cute

2593
02:47:33.470 --> 02:47:36.830
QRF in case anything were to happen at midnight.

2594
02:47:36.831 --> 02:47:41.831
I was woken up and told I needed to go to the coc because they were requesting

2595
02:47:41.931 --> 02:47:46.790
me over the radio.
I shook the cobwebs from my head and walk to the COC.

2596
02:47:46.791 --> 02:47:48.770
After calling to the patrol on the radio,

2597
02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:53.270
I was greeted with Travis Travis's voice in a whisper simply to wish me happy

2598
02:47:53.271 --> 02:47:56.090
birthday.
Throughout the madness of patrolling,

2599
02:47:56.091 --> 02:48:00.260
staying awake all night and searching for Ids.
He had kept me in mind.

2600
02:48:00.980 --> 02:48:03.650
And as soon as the day transition from the second to the third,

2601
02:48:03.651 --> 02:48:08.330
he called over the radio to wish me happy birthday.
A week later I left Iraq,

2602
02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:12.830
the Mitt team and Travis,
I will never forget that and I'll never forget him.

2603
02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:16.690
Yeah.
So you know,

2604
02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:19.750
I just received this the other day and you know,

2605
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:24.260
I still hear from guys that he served with and just little things that,
you know,

2606
02:48:24.261 --> 02:48:27.200
caring about your people having a good sense of humor,

2607
02:48:28.970 --> 02:48:30.560
leadership traits that we can all

2608
02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:33.830
<v 5>use,
no doubt about it.</v>

2609
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:38.760
Crazy held these themes.
They,
they,
they're coming,

2610
02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:41.810
you hear him everywhere.
As far as good leaders,
you know,

2611
02:48:41.811 --> 02:48:44.570
like all the good leaders,
they have these themes that,
that dichotomy,

2612
02:48:44.571 --> 02:48:47.960
like you gotta be strict,
but you can't be like a slave driver.
You know?

2613
02:48:47.961 --> 02:48:49.520
It's that balancing act.

2614
02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:54.860
I guess that's why there's just a few leaders because it's so hard to do.

2615
02:48:55.100 --> 02:48:58.190
You know?
It's like some people think,
oh,
I'm just going to go,
I'm an extreme guy.

2616
02:48:58.340 --> 02:49:00.620
You know,
I'm going to go extreme,
but it's not like that.

2617
02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:05.270
Even a guy with an extreme personality like Travis who can push himself that

2618
02:49:05.271 --> 02:49:08.310
hard to be a national level,
understands

2619
02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:13.310
<v 0>leadership to a point where he knows what it means to call back to base while</v>

2620
02:49:14.341 --> 02:49:18.730
you're out on patrol and wish her happy birthday to one of your men.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2621
02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:23.040
It's just awesome.
It's a good way to put it to echo.
It's a,
it's a balancing act,

2622
02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:26.430
you know,
for,
for everyone to sort of figure it out and you know,
just not one,

2623
02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:32.340
one situation for everyone.
Yeah.
Well,
sir,

2624
02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:34.650
thanks again for,

2625
02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:39.600
for coming on the show and in sharing this story.

2626
02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:44.220
Thank you for your service in the Marine Corps in,
of course.

2627
02:49:45.330 --> 02:49:50.330
Thank you for raising such an incredible man and marine and hero and so on.

2628
02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:59.370
And
once again,

2629
02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:05.460
we see
another,

2630
02:50:07.060 --> 02:50:08.310
another table,

2631
02:50:08.311 --> 02:50:13.311
another legend of bravery and of sacrifice

2632
02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:18.420
from these two oh,
ROIC leaders.

2633
02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:24.810
But I still want to remind everyone as always,
that these are not

2634
02:50:26.370 --> 02:50:29.730
imagined legends or myths.

2635
02:50:30.670 --> 02:50:31.503
Then these aren't

2636
02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:35.880
symbolic stories that were made up

2637
02:50:37.470 --> 02:50:41.910
to reinforce some ancient parable.

2638
02:50:45.250 --> 02:50:49.530
These are the wives of men.
Oh Man,

2639
02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:57.140
who stepped up and step forward and gave everything

2640
02:51:00.660 --> 02:51:01.493
for us.

2641
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:07.710
And in that sacrifice,

2642
02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:14.480
and we see the unmeasurable suffering of the families rock with pain and yet

2643
02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:19.230
filled with pride.

2644
02:51:22.490 --> 02:51:23.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2645
02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:25.480
<v 0>To No.</v>

2646
02:51:28.650 --> 02:51:28.850
Yeah.

2647
02:51:28.850 --> 02:51:33.850
And to have absorbed the light and the love that these men emanated in life.

2648
02:51:42.370 --> 02:51:45.220
A light that will not fade

2649
02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:50.660
and will not grow old like the flesh

2650
02:51:54.390 --> 02:51:56.820
of light that will guide us all

2651
02:52:00.570 --> 02:52:03.870
down the righteous path toward the good,

2652
02:52:05.350 --> 02:52:06.880
regardless of the cost

2653
02:52:12.390 --> 02:52:15.360
for them.
We hold our heads higher

2654
02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:22.070
and do our best to make the world a better place

2655
02:52:24.880 --> 02:52:25.713
<v 1>like they did.</v>

2656
02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:34.800
<v 0>We will do our utmost to emulate Brendan Looney.</v>

2657
02:52:38.300 --> 02:52:42.770
We will be strong.
We will be accountable.
We will not complain.

2658
02:52:46.430 --> 02:52:47.263
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2659
02:52:47.940 --> 02:52:50.100
<v 0>And in the most trying of times,</v>

2660
02:52:50.310 --> 02:52:53.040
we will ask ourselves a simple question.

2661
02:52:56.690 --> 02:52:57.523
Same One.

2662
02:52:57.830 --> 02:53:02.150
The Travis Mannion asked when he faced

2663
02:53:04.180 --> 02:53:05.530
the darkness of the world,

2664
02:53:09.460 --> 02:53:14.170
if not me,
than who.

2665
02:53:21.580 --> 02:53:23.230
So until next time,

2666
02:53:25.730 --> 02:53:30.440
this is Colonel Thomas Mannion good deco and Jocko

2667
02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:33.350
<v 1>out.</v>
