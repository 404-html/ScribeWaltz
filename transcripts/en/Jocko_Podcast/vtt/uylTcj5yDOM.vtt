00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.970
This is Jocko podcast number 60 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.090
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.950
What I am about to relate is anything but a pleasant story in fact is so very

4
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:28.411
unpleasant that I cannot recommend anyone without a strong stomach to read it

5
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.661
for.

6
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:35.661
It is a story of such crime and horror as to almost be unbelievable.

7
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.210
The story of depredations of a horde of degraded criminals,

8
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.540
of incredible beastiality on a peaceful kindly law abiding people.

9
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.270
I believe it has no parallel in modern history.

10
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.410
<v 1>Okay,</v>

11
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.020
<v 0>and that is a warning</v>

12
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.880
that was written by a man by the name of George Fitch who was an American in the

13
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.790
city of Nan Qing China.

14
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.660
He was working for the y MCA in 1937 when the imperial Japanese army invaded.

15
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.460
And I'm going to tell you that that warning is not strong enough.

16
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.630
<v 1>Okay?</v>

17
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.610
<v 0>And I know that many of you listened to this podcast with your children</v>

18
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.720
and I am going to tell you right now this podcast,

19
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.040
this episode is not for children.

20
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.010
This episode is barely even for adults.

21
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.610
And I'm sure that some of you will not make it through this podcast

22
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.250
and I almost decided not to do it.

23
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.310
This podcast,

24
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.430
this episode is going to review a book called the Rape of Nan King by an author

25
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.200
by the name of Iris Chang.

26
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.310
And part of the reason that I decided that I had to cover this book

27
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.590
is because of the story that follows the story.

28
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.540
And that is of Iris Chang,
the author,

29
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.640
a bright,
beautiful,
intelligent,

30
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.980
successful,
and loving woman.
Yeah.

31
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.470
Who was consumed
by darkness.

32
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.790
And I will discuss her fate in a book that was written by her mother,

33
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Ying Yang Chang in a book called the woman who could not forget.

34
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.170
And what happened in the city of Nan king is

35
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.340
it is beyond darkness.

36
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.830
It is,
it is beyond evil.

37
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.420
<v 0>Is pure savagery wanting savagery of the highest order?</v>

39
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.150
And part of me thinks maybe it's best

40
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.000
if it is forgotten.

41
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.280
Maybe that's the best way to prevent it from happening again.

42
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.750
But part of me knows that that is wrong

43
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.070
and the only way to learn

44
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.100
is to study and to understand

45
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.440
and to try and banish.

46
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.880
<v 0>This from our memories,
to me,</v>

48
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.950
that leaves the door,
leaves the door open.

49
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.610
<v 0>For something like this to happen again somewhere.</v>

51
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.470
<v 0>Some time.
But I want to warn you again</v>

53
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.350
that there are parts of this episode that are extremely graphic.

54
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.400
Yeah.
And I didn't put it all in there,

55
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.700
but I absolutely wanted people to understand that this is what happened and I

56
00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:53.420
feel compelled to discuss it.

57
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

58
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.270
<v 0>Four,
four,
one for Iris Chang,</v>

59
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.810
who in my mind sacrificed everything to tell the story

60
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.210
to help ensure that those who suffered all remembered

61
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.280
and also to ensure that the human race at large

62
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.870
has the knowledge,

63
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.380
has the warning that evil exists,

64
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.810
and that mankind is capable of becoming engulfed in that evil.

65
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.890
<v 0>And that man can act without mercy or remorse.</v>

67
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

68
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
<v 0>Or the slightest shred of humanity at all.</v>

69
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.440
Go into the book

70
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.850
to prepare for the inevitable war with China.

71
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.540
Japan had spent decades training it's men for combat.

72
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.150
The molding of young men to serve and the Japanese military began early in life

73
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.070
and in the 1930s the Marshall influence seeped into every aspect of Japanese

74
00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:26.904
boyhood.

75
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.770
Tory shops became virtual shrines to war selling arsenals of toy soldiers,

76
00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:37.950
tanks,
helmets,
uniforms,
rifles,
anti aircraft guns,

77
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.070
bugles and Howard sirs memoirs from that time described pre adolescent boys

78
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.970
waging mock battles in the streets using bamboo poles as imaginary rifles.

79
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.350
Some even tied logs of wood on their back and fantasized about dying as human

80
00:06:58.111 --> 00:07:01.950
bomb heroes in suicide missions.

81
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.130
Now I can tell you I grew up doing all that stuff.

82
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.410
We played war all the time,
all the time.
So I,

83
00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:15.570
I don't find anything shocking about that.

84
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.030
Back to the book,
Japanese schools operated like miniature military units.

85
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.871
Indeed.

86
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:28.190
Some of the teachers were military officers who lectured students on their duty,

87
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.850
on their duty to help Japan fulfill its divine destiny of conquering Asia and

88
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.390
being able to stand up to the world's nations as a people second to none.

89
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.700
Now we're starting to get off course.

90
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.290
They taught young boys how to handle wooden models of guns and older boys.

91
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:50.730
How to handle real ones.

92
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.840
Textbooks became vehicles for military propaganda.

93
00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.200
One geography book even use the shape of Japan as justification for expansion.

94
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.140
We appear to be standing in the vanguard of Asia,

95
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.890
advancing bravely into the Pacific.
At the same time,

96
00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:11.940
we appear ready to defend the Asian continent from outside attack.

97
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.420
Teachers also instilled in boys hatred and contempt for the Chinese people

98
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.740
preparing them psychologically for a future invasion of the Chinese mainland.

99
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.530
One historian tells the story of a squeamish Japanese school boy in the 1930s

100
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:33.020
who burst into tears when told to dissect a frog.

101
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.920
His teacher slammed his knuckles against the boy's head and yelled,

102
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.610
why are you crying about one lousy frog when you grow up,

103
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.940
you'll have to kill 100 200 chinks.

104
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.680
Japanese minister of Education declared that schools were run not for the

105
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:57.120
benefit of the students,
but for the good of the country.

106
00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

107
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.510
<v 0>Elementary school teachers were trained like military recruits with student</v>

108
00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:06.350
teachers housed in barracks and subject to harsh discipline and indoctrination.

109
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.930
In 1890 the imperial rescript on education emerged.

110
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.670
It laid down a code of ethics to govern not only students and teachers,

111
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.680
but every Japanese citizen.

112
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:19.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.260
<v 0>The rescript was the civilian equivalent of Japanese military codes,</v>

114
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:29.470
which valued above all obedience to authority and unconditional loyalty to the

115
00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:36.470
emperor
in every Japanese school.

116
00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:40.790
Copy of the rescript wasn't shrined with a portrait of the emperor and taken out

117
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:41.960
each morning to be red.

118
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

119
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.460
<v 0>It was reputed that more than one teacher who accidentally stumbled over the</v>

120
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:52.461
wards committed suicide to atone for the insult to the sacred document.

121
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:53.990
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

122
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.780
<v 0>so we've got a,
that's an 1890 by the way,</v>

123
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:02.000
1890 so this is generations now that this is being plugged into the,

124
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:07.180
to the students' brains
and these things.

125
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:08.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

126
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.990
<v 0>You know when,
when we,
when we talk about students,
we talk about children,</v>

127
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:17.991
we teach them generally freedom is the ultimate goal.

128
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:20.520
Freedom is the ultimate.

129
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:22.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.480
<v 0>The ultimate,</v>

131
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.190
the ultimate thing to strive for,

132
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.460
the ultimate thing to defend his freedom.

133
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.560
And here they're getting taught that the ultimate thing was obedience to

134
00:10:36.561 --> 00:10:38.960
authority and unconditional loyalty.

135
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.160
Back to the book.

136
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.270
It was common place for teachers to behave like sadistic drill sergeant slapping

137
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.440
children across the cheeks,

138
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:52.640
hitting them with their fists or bludgeoning them with bamboo or wooden swords.

139
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.990
Students were forced to hold a heavy,
heavy objects,
sit on their knees,

140
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.550
stand barefoot in the snow,

141
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.580
or run around the playground until they collapsed from exhaustion.

142
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:02.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.430
<v 0>There were certainly few visits to the schools by indignant or even concerned</v>

144
00:11:07.431 --> 00:11:08.264
parents.

145
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.200
The pressure to conform to our authority intensified if the school boy decided

146
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:14.034
to become a soldier.

147
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:14.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

148
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.890
<v 0>This is hazing and relentless and relentless pecking order usually squelched any</v>

149
00:11:19.961 --> 00:11:22.570
residual spirit of individualism within him.

150
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.900
Obedience was touted as a supreme virtue,

151
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.170
<v 1>okay?</v>

152
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.000
<v 0>And a sense of individual self worth was replaced by a sense of value as a small</v>

153
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:38.001
cog in the larger scheme of things to stablish the sublimation of individuality

154
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:44.301
to the common good superior officers of older soldiers slap recruits for almost

155
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:48.270
no reason at all,
or beat them severely with heaven,
wooden,
raw,

156
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.380
heavy wooden rods according to the author,

157
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.980
Toshio officers often justified unauthorized punishment saying,

158
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.180
I do not beat you because I hate you.
I beat you because I care for you.

159
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.680
Do you think I performed these acts with hands swollen and bloody in a state of

160
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:06.514
madness?

161
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.200
Some youths died under such brutal physical conditions.
Oh,

162
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.490
there's committed suicide.

163
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:13.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

164
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.180
<v 0>The majority became tempered vessels into which the military could pour a new</v>

165
00:12:18.181 --> 00:12:19.980
set of life goals.

166
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.120
So this is complete,
you know,
militant raising of children.

167
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:31.910
And what I want to note here is anybody that thinks you know what?

168
00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:35.300
That probably produced some incredible warriors.
You're actually wrong.

169
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:36.620
<v 1>Okay?</v>

170
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.140
<v 0>Did it,
did it produce warriors?
Yes it did.
But let's,</v>

171
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:44.141
let's remember that these warriors that were raised in this manner,

172
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:51.370
when they had American soldiers and marines that had to face them when they were

173
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:58.750
in incredibly well dug in defensive positions and the Americans had to take

174
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:00.050
beach fronts and beach heads.

175
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

176
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.770
<v 0>The free thinking American soldier prove to be the better.</v>

177
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.600
<v 0>Back to the book,</v>

179
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.630
training was no less grueling a process for aspiring officers above all,

180
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.750
the Japanese cadets were to adopt,
adopt a will,

181
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:23.550
which knows no defeat.

182
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:24.900
<v 1>Okay?</v>

183
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.720
<v 0>So terrified where the cadets have any hint of failure.</v>

184
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.400
That examination results were kept secret to minimize the risk of suicide.

185
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.010
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

186
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.190
<v 0>So that's what,
again,
this was,
this was going all the way back to 1890.</v>

187
00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:42.810
So we've got 40 50 years' worth before we get into this,

188
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.690
where this,
uh,
massacre takes place.

189
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.290
<v 0>Back to the book.
In the summer of 1937,</v>

191
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:53.860
Japan finally succeeded in provoking a full scale war with China.

192
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.320
So Japan was now engaged in a war with China.
They went to Shanghai,

193
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.870
the Japanese invaded Shanghai,
you know,
big giant city.
And they,

194
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.820
they thought they were going to have no factor,
right?

195
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:09.070
Because they're getting told all the time that they're the best and they're the,

196
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.240
there's there,
you know,
the supreme warriors and all this.
Well,

197
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:15.240
going back to the book here,
Japanese military,

198
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.720
military leaders had boasted and seriously believe that Japan could conquer all

199
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:23.950
of mainland China within three months.
We got some arrogance going on here,

200
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.270
but when a battle in a single Chinese city alone,

201
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.650
that was Shanghai dragged from summer to fall,
and then from fall to winter,

202
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.180
it shattered Japanese fantasies of an easy victory.
Here,

203
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:42.280
this primitive people illiterate in military science and poorly trained had

204
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.630
managed to fight the superior Japanese to a stand still.

205
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.120
We're in Shanghai finally fell in November.

206
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.160
The mood of the imperial troops had turned ugly

207
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.260
<v 2>and many say,</v>

208
00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:00.010
and many it was said lusted for revenge as they marched towards Nan King.

209
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.770
So they're on route now.
They had a hard time taking down Shanghai.

210
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.790
They got vengeance on their mind when they're going into the city of Nan King.

211
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.210
Back to the book.
Little was spared on the path to Nan king.

212
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.130
Japanese veterans remember rating tiny farm communities where they clubbed or

213
00:15:20.131 --> 00:15:24.120
bay unaided.
Everyone in sight,
but small villages.

214
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:28.890
We're not the only casualties.
Entire cities were raised to the ground.

215
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.920
Consider the example of sue chow,

216
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.750
a city on the east bank of ty who lake,

217
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.620
one of the oldest cities in China.
It was prized for its delicate silk,

218
00:15:40.621 --> 00:15:43.320
embroidery palaces and Temple Temple's.

219
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.940
It's canals and ancient bridges had earned.
It's earned the city.

220
00:15:47.941 --> 00:15:52.470
It's western nickname.
As the Venice of China.
On November 19th,

221
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.380
on a morning of pouring rain,

222
00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.000
a Japanese advanced guard marched to the gates of Soochow wearing hoods that

223
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:05.001
prevented the Chinese centuries from recognizing them once inside the Japanese

224
00:16:05.581 --> 00:16:10.110
murdered and plundered the city for days burning down ancient landmarks and

225
00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:13.530
abducting thousands of Chinese women for sexual slavery.

226
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.670
The invasion according to the China weekly review,

227
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.970
because the population of the city to drop from 350,000 to less than 500.

228
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

229
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.210
<v 2>But the worst was still to come.</v>

230
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.480
Now there was a general that was sort of in charge of the,
uh,

231
00:16:37.481 --> 00:16:40.910
the Japanese that were heading to,
to Nan king.

232
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.940
His name was general met Zooey and he seemed to have some semblance of honor to

233
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:54.110
him
and gave some pretty,

234
00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:55.040
pretty good,

235
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.850
I would say benevolent type as benevolent as you can be when you're going into

236
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.200
war of orders.

237
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.460
So here's one of the things that he proclaimed the back to the book,

238
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.000
the entry of the imperial army into a foreign capital is a great event in our

239
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:10.490
history,
attracting the attention of the world.

240
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.200
Therefore let no unit enter the city in a disorderly fashion.

241
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.590
Let them know beforehand the matters to be remembered and the position of

242
00:17:18.591 --> 00:17:21.320
foreign rights and interests in the walled city.

243
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.280
Let them be absolutely free from plunder.

244
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.960
He's given some pretty,
like I said,

245
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.170
about as benevolent orders as you could give.
That was Matsui.

246
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.940
Well unfortunately met sir.

247
00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:39.941
We get sick and he can't be the leader,

248
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.480
although he kind of goes in and out of a leadership position as this is going
on.

249
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.440
There's a new guy that comes in and the new guy that comes in is actual royalty

250
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.130
named

251
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.540
<v 0>prince a soccer.
Now,
prince,
prince,</v>

252
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.580
Isaca gets word.

253
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.420
He starts to get to understand the situation that they're going into and he gets

254
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:03.000
told that,
yeah,
they're going to be,
when they take Nan king,

255
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:08.001
they're going to have about 300,000 Chinese troops to deal with.

256
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:09.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

257
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.690
<v 0>and they'd get some preliminary word that it sounds like the,</v>

258
00:18:15.491 --> 00:18:18.480
the Chinese are ready to surrender.
They kind of hear that intelligence.

259
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:20.040
They have spies in there and whatnot.

260
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.740
Back to the book after a soccer heard this report.

261
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:27.090
It was said that his headquarters sent out a set of orders under his personal

262
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:29.880
seal marked secret to be destroyed.

263
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.550
We now know that the message of these orders was clear.

264
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.460
Kill all captives.

265
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.110
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

266
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.710
<v 0>and they actually do have a copy of an order that came out</v>

267
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.580
and this was on December 13th,

268
00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.850
1937 the Japanese 66th battalion received the following command.

269
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.520
I'm not going to read the whole thing,
but here's parts of it.

270
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:59.730
Battalion Battle reporter at zero at two zero zero received order from the

271
00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:04.060
regiment commander to comply with or orders from the brigade commanding

272
00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:08.920
headquarters.
All prisoners of war are to be executed.
Method of execution,

273
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:14.130
divide the prisoners into group of a dozen shoot to kill separately goes on to

274
00:19:14.231 --> 00:19:19.231
give some details about who's supposed to run this and then it continues back to

275
00:19:19.991 --> 00:19:23.830
the book.
The vicinity of the imprisonment must be heavily guarded.

276
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.320
Our intentions are absolutely not to be detected by the prisoners.

277
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.460
Every company is to complete preparation before zero 500 executions are to stop.

278
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.980
Start promptly by that time and action is to be finished by seven 30

279
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.640
so there you go.
Straight up orders,
they're going to kill everyone.

280
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.133
<v 1>And</v>

281
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.130
<v 0>it's very important to note here that says our intentions are absolutely not to</v>

282
00:19:55.131 --> 00:19:57.560
be detected,
so they weren't gonna make it very clean desk,

283
00:19:57.561 --> 00:20:01.910
dine and keep the Chinese from knowing that they were going to kill them all.

284
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.840
Back to the book,
there was a ruthless logic to the order.

285
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.950
The captives could not be fed,
so they had to be destroyed.

286
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.250
Killing them would not only eliminate the food problem,

287
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.240
but diminish the possibility of retaliation.
Moreover,

288
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.450
dead enemies could not form up into guerrilla forces.

289
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.980
So they have their orders,
they go in and the begin the operation.

290
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.650
And here we go.
Back to the book.

291
00:20:30.651 --> 00:20:34.430
All of this was easier to achieve than the Japanese had in tipis and t had

292
00:20:34.431 --> 00:20:38.540
anticipated.
Resistance was sporadic.
Indeed,

293
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.600
it was practically nonexistent having thrown away their arms when attempting to

294
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:46.550
flee the city.
As the Japanese closed in,

295
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.860
many Chinese soldiers simply turned themselves in hoping for better treatment.

296
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:56.290
Once the men surrendered and permitted their hands to be bound,

297
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.050
the rest was easy.

298
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.340
So the Chinese give up their weapons

299
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.770
and allow themselves to be taken.
Not a good idea.

300
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.650
Now we're going to go to a quote from a Japanese soldier

301
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.160
named a,

302
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.820
it was funny yet pittable when I imagined to how they gathered whatever white

303
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:35.551
cloth they could find attached it to a dead twig and marched forward just to

304
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:37.870
surrender.
I thought,

305
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.530
how could they become prisoners with the kind of force that they had?

306
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.910
More than two battalions and even without trying to show any resistance,

307
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.440
there must have been a considerable number of officers for this many troops,

308
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:55.270
but not a single one remained all of them having slipped away and escaped.

309
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:56.104
I thought,

310
00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.330
although we had two companies and those 7,000 prisoners had already been

311
00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:02.080
disarmed,

312
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.160
our troops could have been annihilated had they decided to rise up and revolt.

313
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.410
<v 1>And I</v>

314
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.460
<v 0>didn't go through too much of this,</v>

315
00:22:13.461 --> 00:22:17.610
but it was a chaotic scene when the Chinese who realized what was going to

316
00:22:17.611 --> 00:22:22.100
happen and as that indicated,
a lot of the senior leadership,
they fled the city.

317
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.580
And so it left these soldiers there now with no leadership and what are they

318
00:22:25.581 --> 00:22:26.990
going to do?
And you know,

319
00:22:26.991 --> 00:22:31.550
the Japanese did psychological warfare on them and drop leaflets that said,
hey,

320
00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:34.340
if you surrender,
you'll be treated well.
We have rice for you.

321
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.790
And that's what they did.
They lied,
of course.

322
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

323
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.173
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

324
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.170
When the Japanese military received orders on December 17th to kill prisoners,

325
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:51.100
they proceeded with extra caution that morning the Japanese announced that they

326
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:54.730
were going to transport the Chinese prisoners to a small island in the middle,

327
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.260
in the middle of the Yangtze River.

328
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.430
They explained to the captives that they needed to take special precautions to

329
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:04.600
move for the move and bound the captives,
hands behind their backs.

330
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.570
A task that took all morning and most of the afternoon,

331
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:14.470
sometime between four and 6:00 PM the Japanese divided the prisoners into four

332
00:23:14.751 --> 00:23:17.630
columns and marched them to the west,

333
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.540
skirting the hills and stopping at the river bank.

334
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.620
After three or four hours of waiting and not knowing what was going on,

335
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:28.700
the prisoners could not see any preparations for car crossing the river.

336
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.410
The corporal wrote,
it was going dark.

337
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.420
They did not know that Japanese soldiers already in circled them in a crescent

338
00:23:38.421 --> 00:23:43.040
formation along the river and that they were insights of many machine guns.

339
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.270
<v 2>By the time the,
by the time the executions began,</v>

340
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.580
it was too late for the Chinese to escape.

341
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.130
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.490
<v 2>Suddenly all kinds of guns fired at once.</v>

343
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:55.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

344
00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.900
<v 2>Korea Ricci wrote the sound of the firearms mingled with the desperate yelling</v>

345
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:05.390
and screams for an hour.

346
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:10.570
The Chinese struggled and thrashed about desperately until there were few sounds

347
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:12.110
coming from the group.

348
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

349
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.060
<v 2>From evening until dawn,</v>

350
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.290
the Japanese Bay and edit the bodies one by one.

351
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:29.710
And that scene took place over and over and over again because what they did is

352
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:33.020
they indicated,
and they're not in that order,
if you missed it,

353
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.750
they separated the groups.

354
00:24:34.751 --> 00:24:38.510
So they had them captured inside the city and then they took them in small units

355
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:42.950
of 30 40 Chinese soldiers tied their hands and said,
yep,

356
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:43.731
we're going to transport you.

357
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:45.410
And they did this all over the city at the same time,

358
00:24:45.411 --> 00:24:50.150
coordinated and then took them out to different places outside the city and

359
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:50.984
killed them.

360
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.410
But it wasn't only the soldiers that they did this to back to the book.

361
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.780
After the soldiers surrendered on mass,

362
00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.900
there was virtually no one left to protect the citizens of the city.

363
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.120
Knowing this,
the Japanese poured into Nan King on December,

364
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.750
1319 37 occupying government buildings,
banks and warehouses,

365
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.880
shooting people randomly in the streets,

366
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:19.440
many of them in the back as they ran away using machine guns,

367
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.060
revolvers,
and rifles,
the Japanese fired at the crowds of wounded soldiers,

368
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:29.090
elderly women and children who gathered in the north and central roads and

369
00:25:29.971 --> 00:25:34.920
nearby alleys.
They also killed Chinese civilians in every section of the city.

370
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.210
Tiny lanes,
major boulevards,
mud dug outs,

371
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.790
government buildings,
city squares,

372
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:42.820
<v 1>okay.</v>

373
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.020
<v 2>As victims toppled to the ground moaning and screaming,
the streets,</v>

374
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.770
alleys and ditches of the fallen capital ran rivers of blood.

375
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.920
Much of it coming from people barely alive with no strength left to run away.

376
00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

377
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.740
<v 2>The Japanese systematically killed the city dwellers as they conducted house to</v>

378
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:06.380
house searches for Chinese soldiers and Nan King.

379
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:12.600
But they also massacred the Chinese and nearby suburbs and countryside corpse is

380
00:26:12.601 --> 00:26:17.601
piled up outside the city walls along the river by ponds and lakes and on hills

381
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.470
and mountains.

382
00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:20.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

383
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.360
<v 2>In villages,
near Nan King,</v>

384
00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:26.170
the Japanese shot down in a young man who passed under the presumption that he

385
00:26:26.171 --> 00:26:28.300
was likely to be a former Chinese soldier.

386
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

387
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.730
<v 2>But they also murdered people who could not possibly be Chinese soldiers,</v>

388
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.250
elderly men and women,
for instance,

389
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.240
if they hesitated or even if they fail to understand orders,

390
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.760
which would deliver it in Japanese language.

391
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.250
<v 0>And obviously not every Chinese person spoke Japanese.</v>

392
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.980
So this is now just a full on killing spree.

393
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.080
And I'm going to read a section here.
There was,

394
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:03.110
there was military war correspondents that were there from the Japanese

395
00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:08.340
military.
And I will read this one is from,
uh,
uh,

396
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.000
military war correspondent named Yukio Amata.

397
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.400
And he saw the Chinese Brit,
uh,

398
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.960
prisoners being brought and lined up along the river

399
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.190
back to the book.
Those in the first row were beheaded.

400
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.220
Those in the second row,

401
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.210
we're forced to dump the severed bodies into the river before they themselves

402
00:27:33.211 --> 00:27:34.044
were beheaded.

403
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.280
The killing went on nonstop from morning until night,

404
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.150
but they were only able to kill 2000 persons in this way.

405
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.110
The next day,
tired of killing in this fashion,

406
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.990
they set up machine guns through of them,

407
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:53.991
raked across fire at the lined up prisoners rat tat tat tat triggers were

408
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:57.480
pulled.
The prisoners fled into the water,

409
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.180
but no one was able to make it to the other shore.

410
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:12.050
Systematic murder of everyone is basically what we're dealing with

411
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.930
and when they got their momentum going on,

412
00:28:21.931 --> 00:28:24.540
the extermination of most of the men.

413
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

414
00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.950
<v 0>They turn their attention to the women.</v>

415
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

416
00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.280
<v 0>Back to the book,</v>

417
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.860
women suffered the most tacker,
Coro Kozew,

418
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:43.180
a former soldier and the hundred and 14th division of the Japanese army in

419
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:44.680
Nanking recalled,

420
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.250
no matter how young or old,

421
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.510
they all could not escape the fate of being raped.

422
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:59.280
We sent out coal trucks to the city streets and villages to seize a lot of women

423
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
and then each of them was allocated to 15 to 20 soldiers for sexual intercourse

424
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:07.840
and abuse,

425
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.420
surviving Japanese veterans claim that they,

426
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:20.700
that the army had officially outlawed rape of enemy women,

427
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.290
but rape remained so deeply embedded in Japanese military culture and

428
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:27.960
superstition that no one took the rules seriously.

429
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.300
Many believe that raping virgin would make them more powerful in battle.

430
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:40.190
Soldiers were even known to wear amulets made from the pubic hair of such

431
00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:44.380
victims believing that they possessed magical powers against injury.

432
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.470
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

433
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:51.420
<v 0>the military policy forbidding rape only encouraged soldiers to kill their</v>

434
00:29:51.421 --> 00:29:53.010
victims afterwards.

435
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.540
During an interview for the documentary in the name of the emperor as you must

436
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:01.600
Shiro,

437
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.550
a former Japanese soldier spoke candidly about the process of rape and murder in

438
00:30:06.551 --> 00:30:07.384
Nan king.

439
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:08.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

440
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.580
<v 0>We took turns raping them.
It would be all right if we only rape them.</v>

441
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.500
I shouldn't say all right,

442
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:20.510
but we always stabbed and killed them because dead bodies don't talk.

443
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:30.210
Tacker coral Kozo shared a zoom has bluntness and discussing the issue after

444
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:33.070
raping.
We would also kill them.

445
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:37.090
He recalled these women would start to flee.

446
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:39.970
Once we let them go,
then we would bang,

447
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.670
shoot them in the back and finish them up.

448
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.530
According to surviving veterans,

449
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.130
many of the soldiers felt remarkably little guilt about this.

450
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:52.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

451
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.740
<v 0>Perhaps when we were raping her,
we looked at her as a woman,
a Zuma wrote,</v>

452
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.900
but when we killed her,

453
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.730
we just thought of her as something like a pig.

454
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.100
So
where,

455
00:31:24.101 --> 00:31:29.101
where does this mindset comes from that permits this kind of behavior.

456
00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.040
When you go into the book,

457
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:37.080
the Japanese soldier was not simply hardened for battle in China.

458
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.970
He's hardened for the task of murdering Chinese combatants and noncombatants

459
00:31:41.971 --> 00:31:42.804
alike.

460
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:43.700
<v 1>Okay?</v>

461
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.533
<v 0>Indeed,</v>

462
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.600
various games and exercises were set up by the Japanese military to numb it's

463
00:31:51.111 --> 00:31:54.710
men to the human instinct against killing people who are not attacking.

464
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.580
For example,
on the way to the capitol,

465
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.380
Japanese soldiers were made to participate in killing competitions,

466
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.970
which were avidly covered by the Japanese media,
like sporting events.

467
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.800
The most notorious one appeared in the December 7th issue of the Japan advisor

468
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.260
under the headline sub lieutenants race to fell 100 Chinese running close

469
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:24.940
contest,
sublieutenant,

470
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:29.560
Mukai Toshiaki and sublieutenant Noda to Kishi.

471
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.640
They were in a contest friendly contest to see which one of them will first fell

472
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:41.960
100 Chinese individuals,

473
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.620
individuals sword combat before the Japanese forces completely occupied Nan king

474
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:54.710
there.
Well in the final phase of their race,
running almost neck to neck

475
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.650
on Sunday,
December 5th the score according to ash aside,

476
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:05.651
he was sublieutenant Mukai 89 and sublieutenant noda 78

477
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.340
and just to give some more context on this,

478
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.160
these were just lining people up and chopping their heads off.

479
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:27.250
That's what this was just lining up civilians and let's see who can get to 150

480
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:33.350
or a hundred first
back to the book.

481
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:33.981
A week later,

482
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:38.150
the paper reported that neither man could decide who had passed the hundred mark

483
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:41.000
first,
so they up the goal to one 50

484
00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:47.980
Mkhize blade was slightly damaged in the competition that Japan adviser

485
00:33:47.981 --> 00:33:51.790
reported.
He explained that this was the result of cutting a Chinese.

486
00:33:51.791 --> 00:33:53.620
In half helmet and all

487
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.600
the contest was fun.
He declared

488
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:11.510
another Japanese soldier talking about his experience.

489
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:17.040
Tominaga shows though wrote,
we made them like this.

490
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.040
Good sons,
good daddy's good.

491
00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:23.460
Elder brothers at home were brought to the front to kill each other.

492
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.600
Human beings turned into murdering demons.

493
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.380
Everyone became a demon within three months.

494
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.020
In interview after interview Japan,

495
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:42.050
Japanese veterans from the Nanking Massacre Massacre reported honestly that they

496
00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:46.530
experienced a complete lack of remorse or sense of wrongdoing even when

497
00:34:46.531 --> 00:34:48.480
torturing helpless civilians.

498
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:54.570
Nakatomi Hakuto spoke candidly about his emotions in the fallen capitol.

499
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.543
Quote,

500
00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:00.870
I remember being driven in a truck along a path that had been cleared through

501
00:35:00.871 --> 00:35:03.960
piles of thousands and thousands of slaughtered bodies.

502
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:10.080
Wild dogs were gnawing at the dead flesh as we stopped and pulled a group of

503
00:35:10.081 --> 00:35:11.700
Chinese prisoners out of the back.

504
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:17.870
Then the Japanese officer proposed a test of my courage.
He an sheath,

505
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.480
his sword spat on it and with a sudden mighty swing.

506
00:35:21.481 --> 00:35:25.410
He brought it down on the neck of a Chinese boy cowering before us.

507
00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.350
The head was cut clean off and tumbled away on the group as the body slumped

508
00:35:31.351 --> 00:35:32.184
forward.

509
00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.530
Blood spurting out in two great gushing fountains from neck.

510
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.350
The officer suggested I take the head home as a souvenir.

511
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:51.020
I remember smiling proudly as I took his sword and began killing people.

512
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.700
Few know that soldiers in paled babies on bay and nets and toss them still alive

513
00:35:59.271 --> 00:36:00.860
into pots of boiling water.

514
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:07.220
They gang raped women from ages of 12 to 80 and then killed them when they could

515
00:36:08.431 --> 00:36:11.400
no longer satisfy sexual requirements.

516
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.510
I be headed people,
starve them to death,

517
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.620
burn them and buried them alive over 200 and all.

518
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.970
It is terrible that I could turn into an animal and do these things.

519
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.930
There are really no words to explain what I was doing.

520
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:34.850
I was truly a devil.

521
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.980
Beyond those situations,

522
00:36:55.981 --> 00:37:00.170
torture was also completely common.

523
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.953
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

524
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.360
<v 0>and here's what the book says.</v>

525
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.620
The torture that the Japanese inflicted upon the native population at Nan king

526
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.600
almost suppresses,
suppresses the limits of human comprehension.

527
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:20.530
Here are only a few examples.
Live burials,

528
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.230
the Japanese directed burial operations.

529
00:37:23.231 --> 00:37:25.630
With the precision and efficiency of an assembly line,

530
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.590
soldiers would force one group of Chinese captives to dig a grave,

531
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.790
a second group to bury the first and then a third group to vary the second and

532
00:37:33.791 --> 00:37:34.624
so on.

533
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:39.160
Some victims were partially buried to their chest or next so that they would

534
00:37:39.161 --> 00:37:44.020
endure further agony such as being hacked to pieces by swords or run over by

535
00:37:44.021 --> 00:37:45.550
horses and tanks,

536
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.290
mutilation the Japanese,

537
00:37:50.291 --> 00:37:53.860
not only disemboweled decapitated and dismembered victims,

538
00:37:53.861 --> 00:37:58.861
but performed more excruciating varieties of torture throughout the city.

539
00:37:59.471 --> 00:38:02.590
They nailed prisoners to wooden boards and ran over them with tanks,

540
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.110
crucified them to trees and electrical posts,

541
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:09.460
carve long strips of flesh from them and use them for bayonet practice.

542
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.240
At least 100 men reportedly had their eyes gouged out and their noses and ears

543
00:38:15.551 --> 00:38:18.040
hacked off before being set on fire.

544
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.050
Well,
another group of 200 Chinese soldiers and civilians were stripped naked,

545
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:31.000
tied to columns and doors of a school and then stabbed by special needles with

546
00:38:31.001 --> 00:38:35.770
handles on them in hundreds of points along their bodies including mouth's

547
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.510
throats and eyes,

548
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.180
death by fire.

549
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

550
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.200
<v 0>The Japanese subjected large crowds of victims to mass incineration,</v>

551
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.600
a Japanese soldier bound Chinese captives together 10 at a time and pushed him

552
00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:58.810
into a pit where there were sprayed with gasoline and ignited

553
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.080
on taping road.

554
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.730
The Japanese ordered a large number of shop clerks to extinguish a fire,

555
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.970
then bound them together with rope and threw them into the blaze.

556
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.060
Japanese soldiers even devised games with fire.

557
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.410
One method of entertainment was to drive mobs of Chinese to the top.

558
00:39:19.411 --> 00:39:21.030
Stories are roofs of buildings,

559
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:25.110
tear down the stairs and then set the bottom floors on fire.

560
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:31.580
Many such victims committed suicide by jumping out of windows or off rooftops.

561
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:33.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

562
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:37.770
<v 0>Another form of amusement involve dowsing victims and fuel shooting them and</v>

563
00:39:37.771 --> 00:39:39.930
watching them explode into flame.

564
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:46.430
In one infamous incident,
Japanese soldiers forced hundreds of men,
women,

565
00:39:46.431 --> 00:39:47.720
and children into a square,

566
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.170
soak them with gasoline and then fired on them with machine guns.

567
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.990
Death by ice.

568
00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:00.520
Thousands of victims were intentionally frozen to death during the rape of Nan

569
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.180
King.

570
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

571
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.410
<v 0>For instance,</v>

572
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.220
Japanese soldiers forced hundreds of Chinese prisoners to march to the edge of a

573
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:09.610
frozen pond where they were ordered to strip naked,
break the ice,

574
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:11.470
and plunged in the water to go fishing.

575
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.040
Their bodies hardened into floating targets that were immediately riddled with

576
00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:20.540
Japanese bullets.
In another incident,

577
00:40:20.541 --> 00:40:22.850
the Japanese tied up a group of refugees,

578
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.500
flung them into a shallow pond and bombarding them with hand grenades causing an

579
00:40:27.501 --> 00:40:29.870
explosive shower of blood and flesh

580
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.530
death by dogs.

581
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:40.140
One diabolical means of torture was to bury victims to their waist and watched

582
00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:42.610
them get ripped apart by German shepherds.

583
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:49.470
Witnesses saw Japanese soldiers strip a victim naked and direct German shepherds

584
00:40:50.141 --> 00:40:52.360
to bite sensitive areas of his body.

585
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.520
The dogs not only ripped open his belly,

586
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.390
but jerked out his intestines along the ground for a distance.

587
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.770
The incidents mentioned above are only a fraction of the methods that the

588
00:41:06.771 --> 00:41:09.140
Japanese used to torment.
They're victims.

589
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:15.960
The Japanese saturated victims and acid in paled babies with bayonets hung

590
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:17.470
people by their tongues.

591
00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.440
One Japanese reporter who later investigated the rape of Nanking learned that at

592
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:27.670
least one Japanese soldier toward the heart and liver out of a Chinese victim to

593
00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:28.504
eat them.

594
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.010
Even genitals apparently were consumed.

595
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.610
A Chinese soldier who escaped from Japanese custody saw several dead people in

596
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:39.650
the streets with their penises cut off.

597
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:46.400
He was later told that the penis is were sold to Japanese customers who believe

598
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:49.130
that eating them would increase versatility.

599
00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.493
<v 1>Okay.</v>

600
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.410
<v 0>With regards to the fate of the women,</v>

601
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:17.170
they don't know how to determine the exact number of the women that were raped.

602
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:23.560
<v 1>Hey Nan king,
but</v>

603
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:28.920
<v 0>they do know that it was almost a universal.</v>

604
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

605
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.680
<v 0>Back to the book,
the Japanese raped Nan king,
women from all classes,</v>

606
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.910
farm wives,
students,
teachers,
white collar and blue collar workers,

607
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.690
wives of y,
Ymca employees,
university professors,

608
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:47.430
even Buddhist nuns,
some of whom were gang raped to death

609
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:53.400
and they were systematic in their recruitment of women.
And Nan King.

610
00:42:53.401 --> 00:42:57.810
Japanese soldiers searched for them constantly as they looted homes and drag men

611
00:42:57.811 --> 00:42:59.310
off wretch execution.

612
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.930
Some actually conducted door to door searches,

613
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.050
demanding money and young girls.

614
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:14.690
Chinese women were raped in all locations and at all hours.

615
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

616
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.860
<v 0>An estimated one third of all rapes occur during the day.</v>

617
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.920
Survivors even remember soldiers prying open the legs of victims to rape them in

618
00:43:24.921 --> 00:43:29.360
broad daylight in the middle of the street and in front of crowds of witnesses.

619
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.900
No place was too sacred for rape.

620
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:38.120
The Japanese attacked women and nunneries churches and Bible training schools.

621
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:45.430
17 soldiers raped one woman succession in a seminary compound.

622
00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.513
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

623
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.070
<v 0>Old Age was no concern to the Japanese matrons,</v>

624
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:55.910
grandmothers and great grandmothers and dirt repeated sexual assaults.

625
00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.533
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.830
<v 0>Or Japanese soldier who raped a woman of 60 was ordered to clean the penis by</v>

627
00:44:02.831 --> 00:44:07.440
her mouth.
When a woman of 62 protested to soldiers,
that was,

628
00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:12.430
she was too old for sex.
They rammed a stick up in style at her.
Instead.

629
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:20.260
Many women in their eighties were raped to death and at least one woman in that

630
00:44:20.361 --> 00:44:24.800
age group was shot and killed because she refused.
A Japanese soldiers advances.

631
00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.560
If the Japanese treatment of old women was terrible,

632
00:44:39.561 --> 00:44:41.990
their treatment of young children was unthinkable.

633
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:45.940
Little girls were raped,

634
00:44:45.941 --> 00:44:50.020
so Butte brutally that some could not walk for weeks afterwards.

635
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.070
Many required surgery,
others died.

636
00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:01.010
Chinese witnesses saw Japanese rape girls under 10 years of age in the streets

637
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.450
and then slash them and half by sword.

638
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.160
In some cases,

639
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:11.960
the Japanese sliced open the Vaginas of preteen girls in order to ravish them

640
00:45:11.961 --> 00:45:12.980
more effectively.

641
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.150
Even in advanced stages of pregnancy,

642
00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.750
did not render women immune to assault.

643
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:40.780
The Japanese violated many who are about to go into labor or in labor or who had

644
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:42.730
given birth only a few days earlier.

645
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:49.000
One victim who is nine months pregnant was raped,
suffered not only stillbirth,

646
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.920
but a complete mental collapse.

647
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.310
At least one pregnant woman was kicked to death.

648
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.340
Still more gruesome was the treatment.

649
00:45:57.341 --> 00:46:00.040
A lot of does some of the unborn children of these women

650
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.780
after gang rape,

651
00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.740
Japanese soldiers sometimes slashed open the bellies of pregnant women and

652
00:46:06.741 --> 00:46:09.290
ripped out the fetuses for amusement

653
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:35.970
during the mass rape.

654
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:39.660
The Japanese destroyed children and infants often because they were in the way

655
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:42.560
I witness's report

656
00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.410
describe children and babies suffocating from close,

657
00:46:47.411 --> 00:46:50.530
stuffed in their mouth's or bayoneted to death because they wept as their

658
00:46:50.531 --> 00:46:51.850
mothers were being raped.

659
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:58.290
American and European observers of the rape of Nanking recorded numerous entries

660
00:46:58.331 --> 00:46:59.260
like this one

661
00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:07.250
February 3rd about 5:00 PM at Chuang Tzu who sang three soldiers came and forced

662
00:47:08.971 --> 00:47:13.770
a woman to throw away her baby.
After raping her,
they went away laughing.

663
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:37.650
Perhaps one of the most brutal forms of Japanese entertainment was the

664
00:47:37.651 --> 00:47:42.000
impalement of Vaginas in the streets of Nan King.

665
00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:45.660
Corpses of women lay with their legs splayed open there,

666
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:49.200
orifice pierced by wooden rods,
twigs and weeds.

667
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:51.560
It's painful.

668
00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:55.820
Almost mind numbing to contemplate some of the other objects that were used to

669
00:47:55.821 --> 00:47:57.140
torment the Nan king.

670
00:47:57.141 --> 00:48:01.730
Women who suffered almost unendurable or deals.

671
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.011
For instance,

672
00:48:04.011 --> 00:48:08.030
one Japanese soldier who raped a young woman for us to beer bottle into her and

673
00:48:08.031 --> 00:48:08.864
shot her.

674
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.170
Another rape victim was found with a golf stick rammed into her

675
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.600
and on December 22nd at a neighborhood near the gate of Tongan men,

676
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:26.190
the Japanese raped a barber's wife and then stuck a firecracker in her vagina.

677
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.900
It blew up and killed her,

678
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.863
<v 1>okay?</v>

679
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.800
<v 0>Not all the victims were women.</v>

680
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.100
Chinese men were often sodomized,

681
00:48:41.101 --> 00:48:45.120
are forced to perform a variety of repulsive sexual acts in front of laughing

682
00:48:45.121 --> 00:48:47.910
Chinese soldiers or Japanese soldiers.

683
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:49.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

684
00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:52.920
<v 0>At least one Chinese man was murdered because you refuse to commit necrophilia</v>

685
00:48:52.921 --> 00:48:54.660
with the corpse of a woman in the snow.

686
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.800
The Japanese also delighted and trying to course men who had taken lifetime vows

687
00:49:02.801 --> 00:49:05.590
of celibacy to engage in sexual intercourse.

688
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.060
A Chinese woman had tried to disguise herself as a man,

689
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:11.770
try and pass through the gates of Nan King,

690
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:15.520
but Japanese guards who systematically searched all passing pedestrians by

691
00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:18.850
groping at their crotches,
discovered her true sex

692
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.151
gang,
raped,

693
00:49:21.151 --> 00:49:26.151
followed at which time a Buddhist monk had the misfortune to venture near the

694
00:49:26.641 --> 00:49:27.270
scene.

695
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:30.870
The Japanese tried to force him to have sex with a woman they had just raped.

696
00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:32.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

697
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.880
<v 0>When the monk pro protested,</v>

698
00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.900
they castrated him causing the poor man to bleed to death.

699
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:45.790
Some of the most sore it instances of sexual torture involve the degradation of

700
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:47.110
entire families,

701
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:53.230
the Japanese Jiu sadistic pleasure enforcing Chinese men to commit incest

702
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:58.030
fathers to rape their own daughters,
brothers,
their sisters,
sons,
their mothers.

703
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.440
A Chinese battalion commander stranded in Nan King for three months after the

704
00:50:03.441 --> 00:50:04.220
city fell,

705
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.360
saw or heard of at least four or five instances in which the Japanese ordered

706
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:10.040
sons to rape their mothers.

707
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:16.780
Those who refused were killed on the spot.
His report,

708
00:50:16.781 --> 00:50:21.280
a substantiated by the testimony of a German diplomat who reported that one

709
00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:25.480
Chinese man who refuse to rape his own mother was killed with Saber strokes and

710
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:28.130
that his mother committed suicide shortly thereafter.

711
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:31.163
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

712
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.860
<v 2>Those who defied the Japanese were often found later with their eyes torn out,</v>

713
00:50:50.861 --> 00:50:53.230
their noses,
ears,
and breasts cut off.

714
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

715
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:13.663
As I said,

716
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.460
<v 2>this is pure evil</v>

717
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:27.163
<v 1>and</v>

718
00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.320
<v 2>I don't know what else to say.</v>

719
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:46.660
<v 1>Yeah,
no,</v>

720
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.460
<v 2>I'm going to the book here.</v>

721
00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:54.960
It's hard to talk about a bright spot in the horror that is the rape of Nanking.

722
00:51:54.961 --> 00:51:55.731
But if one can,

723
00:51:55.731 --> 00:51:59.820
it is surely to shine a light on the actions of a small band of Americans and

724
00:51:59.821 --> 00:52:04.050
Europeans who risked their lives to defy the Japanese invaders and rescue

725
00:52:04.051 --> 00:52:09.051
hundreds of thousands of Chinese refugees from almost certain extermination.

726
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:15.550
The courageous men and women created the International Committee for the Nanking

727
00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:18.220
Safety Zone.
So this is,
you know,

728
00:52:18.221 --> 00:52:23.221
amongst obviously this just most sadistic and heinous evil.

729
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:29.910
There were some Americans and some Europeans that lived and worked in Nan king.

730
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:36.520
And you gotta remember this is 1937 so it wasn't a world war yet.
The,

731
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:40.300
there was Germans there,
a Napkin and Nan king,
there was Americans there,

732
00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:43.330
Nan King.
And when this started to happen,

733
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:48.750
there was several of them who basically formed an area where it said,

734
00:52:49.211 --> 00:52:50.980
hey,
you know,
this is a safe zone.

735
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:56.920
And one of them interestingly was a German.

736
00:52:56.921 --> 00:52:57.760
It was a Nazi.

737
00:52:59.130 --> 00:52:59.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

738
00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:04.860
<v 2>So there is a Nazi who they ended up calling the Living Buddha of Nan and king.</v>

739
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:06.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

740
00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:11.100
<v 2>And so
this,
this individual,</v>

741
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.880
um,
John Rabe was,

742
00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:21.090
he risked his life to set up this,
the safety zone.
And actually,
no,
he was,
uh,

743
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.610
he was,
uh,
like I said,
he was a Nazi,

744
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:27.240
but he had spent much time in Nan king did.

745
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:30.420
He had all these Chinese friends and you know,
according to this,

746
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.960
to the background on him,
you know,
he's there in 19,

747
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.890
he's been there for many years and I don't know what year he got there,

748
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:41.100
but he's not familiar with what's going on with the actual Nazi party back in

749
00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:44.040
Germany.
He's disconnected.
I mean there's,
you know,
this is whatever,

750
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.160
there's no internet.
He's not watching TV.
He doesn't know what's going on.

751
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:49.920
So he was just sort of sort of there.
And Oh,

752
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:53.280
the prominent party in Germany is the Nazi party.
Oh.
And I'm a diplomat,

753
00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:57.570
so I guess I'm a Nazi.
And,
but when he,
you know,

754
00:53:57.571 --> 00:54:01.230
he sounded like he was a guy that was a benevolent guy.

755
00:54:01.231 --> 00:54:06.060
He actually went out into town and literally stop rapes from happening himself.

756
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.980
And what's interesting is,
and this,
this to me,

757
00:54:08.981 --> 00:54:13.890
he set up that you could see what they thought of the Chinese people is that all

758
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:16.140
he would do is go out and speak,
stop.
And He,

759
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:21.180
he had the Nazi armband or what he had Nazi the swastika and when they saw that

760
00:54:21.181 --> 00:54:22.780
they would listen to them.
And so,

761
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.860
I mean he still like he was a white guy and they,

762
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.010
they clearly listened to him and were kind of afraid of him.

763
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:31.740
And yet,
you know,

764
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:36.770
obviously they had zero less than zero respect for the Chinese people.

765
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.260
And so,

766
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:45.320
so he actually wrote a letter as well to Hitler explaining what was going on.

767
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:50.520
And you know,
there's,
there's no one knows if Hitler actually ever read it.

768
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:53.010
It sounds like he read it and ignored it.

769
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.060
But one of the most interesting and important pieces of what John Raved did is

770
00:54:57.061 --> 00:54:59.310
he,
he kept a journal,

771
00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:03.270
a detailed journal of what had happened.

772
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:08.070
So a lot of the stuff that I just quoted,
which I know is,
is horrible.

773
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.940
He was the guy,
he's one of the rare people that that wrote it down.

774
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:17.100
And made sure that P,
that it was going to be recorded.
And actually the,

775
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:18.563
the,

776
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:24.110
that diary didn't get really discovered and uncovered until much later until

777
00:55:25.771 --> 00:55:30.590
really,
and,
and,
um,
I was,
Chang is the one that sort of popularized and,

778
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:35.660
and took this journal and made it into a real document that explained what had

779
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:38.970
happened there.
So that's,
you know,
again,
this,

780
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:42.690
this John Rabe,
you know,
let's,

781
00:55:42.691 --> 00:55:45.720
let's even in all that darkness,

782
00:55:45.721 --> 00:55:49.020
there was people that stepped up and spoke against it.

783
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:54.020
Another one was a guy named by the name of Robert Wilson and he was actually

784
00:55:55.231 --> 00:56:00.231
grew up in Nan king and he was a Methodist missionary,

785
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:04.200
but he had been left Nan king and gone back to America.

786
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:07.170
He went to Princeton and then he went to Harvard medical school.

787
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.340
And when he got done with all of the schooling and instead of staying in
America,

788
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:15.150
he went back to Nan king to become a surgeon in Nan king.

789
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:17.850
And he was him along with John Rabe.

790
00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:22.851
These were the guys that went out and set up this protective zone and did all

791
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:26.050
kinds of,
you know,
it's,
it's sort of like a Schindler's list scenario.
No,

792
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:29.620
they were helping soldiers get rid of their papers and give them clothes.

793
00:56:29.621 --> 00:56:32.860
They didn't look like Chinese soldiers sheltering the women.

794
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:38.040
Bring in setting up a places where the women can hide in the addicts of the

795
00:56:38.081 --> 00:56:40.750
buildings.
That's what they were doing.
And it's the only thing that's,

796
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.460
well I guess not different,
but you know,

797
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:46.810
it's different in the fact that they could get away with it because we weren't

798
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:49.720
at war with the Japanese.

799
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.740
And so this Guy Wilson was,
was a surgeon.

800
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:55.450
So not only was he trying to protect people,

801
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.720
he was doing surgery on them all the time,

802
00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:01.150
trying to get them to try to save them from these devastating wounds that they

803
00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:01.984
had.

804
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:09.190
He also kept a really detailed diary,

805
00:57:09.191 --> 00:57:13.960
which again,
these these,
and this is part of the whole

806
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:19.960
kind of genesis of this book,
is that,
and I'll get to this later,
but

807
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.870
the,
you know,

808
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:26.170
you've heard of like Holocaust deniers of the Holocaust didn't happen.
The world,

809
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:29.500
it's the same thing with this event.
People say,
oh,
it wasn't that bad.
You know,

810
00:57:29.501 --> 00:57:31.870
it wasn't that big of a deal that will,
you know,
there were some killing.

811
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:35.260
So there was people that said that,
you know,
some Japanese nationalists and said,

812
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:36.970
no,
that didn't really,
wasn't really that bad.

813
00:57:36.971 --> 00:57:41.380
It was provoked or whatever they're going to say.
And these documents,
these,

814
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:46.180
these documents that corroborate all this information,
we're truly important.

815
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.410
Going back to the book here,
one of the worst scenes,
Nielsen saw net.

816
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:54.670
Wilson saw Nan king a scene he would remember for the rest of his life,

817
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:59.380
a massive gang of Ugh,
massive gang rape of teenage girls in the street.

818
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:04.900
A group of young women between the ages of 15 and 18 were lined up by Japanese

819
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:09.400
and then raped in the dirt,
one after the other by an entire regiment.

820
00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:15.520
Some hemorrhaged and died while others killed themselves shortly afterwards.

821
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:19.870
But the scenes in the hospitals were even more horrifying than those in the

822
00:58:19.871 --> 00:58:20.704
streets.

823
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.390
Wilson was mortified by the women who came to the emergency room with their

824
00:58:25.391 --> 00:58:30.391
bellies ripped open by the charred and horribly disfigured men whom the Japanese

825
00:58:31.031 --> 00:58:34.090
tried to burn alive and by numerous other horrors.

826
00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.180
He had barely had time to describe on paper.

827
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.790
He told his wife that he would never forget a woman whose head was nearly caught

828
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:44.830
off teetering from a point on her neck.

829
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:51.040
The morning came this morning,
and this is quote this morning,

830
00:58:51.041 --> 00:58:55.090
another woman came in a sad plight and with a terrible story,

831
00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.720
a hospital volunteer wrote of this woman in his diary in January 3rd,

832
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:05.830
1938 she was one of the five women whom the Japanese soldier had taken to one of

833
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:09.790
their medical units to wash their clothes to buy day and be raped by night.

834
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.250
Two of them were forced.

835
00:59:12.251 --> 00:59:17.080
The two of them were forced to satisfy from 15 to 20 men and the prettiest one

836
00:59:17.081 --> 00:59:18.580
as much as 40 each night.

837
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 0>This one who came to us had been called off by three soldiers into an isolated</v>

838
00:59:25.611 --> 00:59:27.680
place where they attempted to cut off her head.

839
00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:28.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

840
00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:32.730
<v 0>The muscles of the neck had been cut,
but they failed to sever the spinal cord.</v>

841
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.240
She feigned death,
but dragged herself to the hospital,

842
00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:41.580
another of the many to bear witness to the brutality of the soldiers,

843
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.440
so Wilson just saw complete horrors.

844
00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:51.700
Then back to the book,

845
00:59:51.701 --> 00:59:55.360
he operated for free because few patients had money to pay him,

846
00:59:55.540 --> 01:00:00.040
but the surgeries exactly at a terrible price on his own health.
In the end,

847
01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.810
his family believes that the old,

848
01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:06.790
only his faith as a devout Methodist combined with his love for China gave him

849
01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:09.190
the courage to survive the rape of Nan King.

850
01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

851
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:17.000
<v 0>Another one of these Europeans in this case,</v>

852
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.980
American Western or I should say was veal.

853
01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:27.100
Amina Voltron or mini Voltron as they called her as by occupation.

854
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.450
Head of the education department,

855
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.480
Dean of studies at Guinn Ling Women's arts and Science College was one of the

856
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:42.860
few Western women in the city during the first few weeks of the Nanking
massacre.

857
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:44.443
Years later,

858
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:47.510
she would be remembered not only for her courage and protecting thousands of

859
01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:50.390
women from Japanese soldier,
but also for the diary.

860
01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:54.710
She kept a diary that some historians believe will eventually be recognized,

861
01:00:54.711 --> 01:00:59.150
much like the diary of Anne Frank for its importance in illuminating the spirit

862
01:00:59.151 --> 01:01:01.490
of a single witness during the holocaust of war

863
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:04.933
Voltron,

864
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:10.030
the daughter of a blacksmith was 51 years old in 1937 raised in the tiny farming

865
01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:12.890
community of or Illinois.

866
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:16.190
She went to live with neighbors when her mother died.

867
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.980
Despite the impoverishment of her childhood,

868
01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:21.200
she was able to work her way through school,

869
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:26.240
graduating with honors in 1912 from the University of Illinois at Urbana,

870
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.740
Urbana,
champagne,

871
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:37.540
so just again a of a western or in this case in American and she had the

872
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:42.050
opportunity to maybe escape,
but she stayed in Nan king.

873
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.800
Back to the book with most of the Faculty gone from Nan King,

874
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.190
most of the abandoned their homes to flee to cities like Shanghai,

875
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:54.191
Shin Cu and share Schwann Voltron was now the acting head of the institution.

876
01:01:56.270 --> 01:02:00.350
She labored to prepare for the campus for female refugees and to evacuate

877
01:02:00.351 --> 01:02:03.080
wounded soldiers from the area to disguise their identity.

878
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:06.980
She burned their military papers and carpets and the college incinerator under

879
01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:10.370
her direction.
Furniture was moved into attics.
Safes were emptied,

880
01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:15.500
dorms were cleaned,
and valuables were wrapped in oil,
paper and hidden.

881
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.420
Meanwhile,
posters,

882
01:02:17.421 --> 01:02:22.421
signs and arm bands for the Ne Nan King Safety Zone were created and distributed

883
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.420
among the volunteers.

884
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.840
Here's talking about a specific day.
The following day,
December 17th,

885
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.680
1937 was even worse.

886
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:42.240
The migration of women into giggling only intensified as the Japanese soldiers

887
01:02:42.241 --> 01:02:44.850
flooded the city.
What a heartbreaking site.

888
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.480
Voltron wrote weary women,
frightened girls,

889
01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:51.810
trudging with children and bedding and small packages of clothes.

890
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:56.190
If only someone had time to write the story of each refugee who came in.

891
01:02:56.191 --> 01:02:57.024
She thought,

892
01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.990
especially the stories of the girls who had black and their faces and cut their

893
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:05.580
hair,
has she accommodated the stream of wild eyed women?

894
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:10.630
She heard stories of Japanese raping girls as young as 12 and women is elderly a

895
01:03:10.631 --> 01:03:14.190
60 or raping pregnant women at Bayonet Point?

896
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.033
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

897
01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.613
<v 0>And</v>

898
01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:30.243
<v 1>yeah,</v>

899
01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.293
<v 0>the</v>

900
01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:39.090
sick and deprived and disgusting in horrific stories go on and on and on.

901
01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.440
And the brutality page after page after page of diary entries and quotes and

902
01:03:49.781 --> 01:03:51.010
witness accounts

903
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:57.500
and then pictures,
there's pictures in the book.

904
01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

905
01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.960
<v 0>The pictures of severed heads and Chinese bound to polls being bayoneted to</v>

906
01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:08.961
death and pictures of others being beheaded in pictures of giant pits filled

907
01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:14.031
with bodies and images of hundreds and hundreds of bodies and entangles masses

908
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.140
on the banks of the gangs.
He River.

909
01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:20.643
It's

910
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:24.543
<v 1>okay.</v>

911
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.660
<v 0>It's,
it's too much for the mind to comprehend.
It really is.</v>

912
01:04:28.661 --> 01:04:30.760
It's almost too much to understand.

913
01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:33.700
And so what we do

914
01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:39.940
is we package it all up,
right.

915
01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:42.760
And we give it a name,
a massacre.

916
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

917
01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.430
<v 0>Or an atrocity.</v>

918
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.700
And I'm sure you could tell,
I mean,
even as I'm sitting here reading this,

919
01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:59.070
I'm gone,
I'm just numb.

920
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:02.410
But we

921
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.570
BAFTA remembered that every one of those people

922
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:13.980
tortured,
raped,
and he killed.
Was a person,

923
01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:24.110
a person like your brother or like your sister or like your mom or like your

924
01:05:24.571 --> 01:05:25.404
dad.

925
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.333
<v 1>Okay.</v>

926
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.470
<v 0>Or a person like your son or your daughter.</v>

927
01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.260
A person
like you

928
01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.240
and maybe you can get ahold of that.

929
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:56.710
But what's in some ways even harder to grasp is the Japanese soldiers

930
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:05.190
the day where people,

931
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:13.390
and yes,
they were certainly monsters,
vial

932
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:18.970
and despicable and completely devoid of feelings,

933
01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:22.960
but even so,
even though they were were monsters,

934
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.990
they were human monsters

935
01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:34.060
and they too had mothers and fathers and sons and daughters.

936
01:06:35.301 --> 01:06:38.720
And yet they did this.

937
01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:52.230
And the fact that what happened at Nan king was so brutal.

938
01:06:52.231 --> 01:06:57.231
And so beyond comparison with anything that ever happened.

939
01:06:59.170 --> 01:06:59.910
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

940
01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:04.080
<v 0>it was one of the things that almost caused it to be forgotten</v>

941
01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:11.930
and that that supreme level of brutality lasted about six weeks.

942
01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:21.220
And eventually that morphed into an occupation of Nan king by the Japanese.

943
01:07:22.611 --> 01:07:24.860
And they ruled with an iron fist of course.

944
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:30.490
And they stole and they plundered a navy abused locals and they continued to,

945
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:31.743
to rape,

946
01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:37.550
which they actually institutional institutionalized and,
and eventually became,

947
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.230
<v 1>okay,</v>

948
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:40.820
<v 0>you've heard the term comfort women</v>

949
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and they gave out opium freely to unsaved people.

950
01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:50.560
Just like happens in this day and age,

951
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.590
people become slaves to drugs.

952
01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.550
And it stayed in that occupied state for,

953
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:02.500
<v 1>yeah,</v>

954
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.370
<v 0>about eight years until finally,</v>

955
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.340
almost as quickly as it began.

956
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.003
<v 1>It ended</v>

957
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:14.800
<v 0>going back to the book.</v>

958
01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:22.770
The end of Nan kings or deal came in the last game at last in the summer of 1945

959
01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.660
on August 6th,

960
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:33.660
1945 the United States dropped an untested uranium bomb on Hiroshima Japan's

961
01:08:34.031 --> 01:08:38.260
eighth largest city killing 100,000 of its 245 people,

962
01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.110
245,000 people on the first day

963
01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:46.470
when the Japanese surrender was not forthcoming,

964
01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:51.710
the Americans dropped on August 9th a second plutonium type bomb on the Japanese

965
01:08:52.111 --> 01:08:53.430
city of Nagasaki.

966
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:55.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

967
01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.700
<v 0>Less than a week later on August 14th the Japanese made the final decision to</v>

968
01:09:00.701 --> 01:09:01.534
surrender.

969
01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:08.100
The Japanese remained in the former capitol of China until the day of the

970
01:09:08.101 --> 01:09:08.934
surrender.

971
01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:13.560
Then quickly left the city I witnesses reported that Japanese soldier could be

972
01:09:13.561 --> 01:09:16.110
seen drinking heavily or weeping in the streets.

973
01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:20.730
Some heard rumors of unarmed Japanese men being forced to kneel by the side of

974
01:09:20.731 --> 01:09:23.130
the road to be beaten by local residents.

975
01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:28.050
Retaliation against the Japanese garrison appears to be to have been limited.

976
01:09:28.051 --> 01:09:28.710
However,

977
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:33.150
because many residents he had at home during this chaotic time too fearful to

978
01:09:33.151 --> 01:09:35.670
even celebrate the news of a Japanese defeat,

979
01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:43.980
the evacuation was swift and there was no mass persecution or imprisonment of

980
01:09:43.981 --> 01:09:45.390
Japanese soldiers.

981
01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:50.280
One Nan king resident recalls that she stayed in her house for weeks after the

982
01:09:50.281 --> 01:09:54.810
Japanese surrendered and when she reemerged they were gone.

983
01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.040
And so it was over

984
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:06.520
and there were work,
some,

985
01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:11.640
some level of war crime trials and there were some executions.

986
01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.240
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

987
01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.240
<v 0>mainly of the highest profile officer's Prince Osaka who had given that order to</v>

988
01:10:20.451 --> 01:10:24.290
kill all captives.
He avoided prosecution.

989
01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:28.490
The scale of the massacre was downplayed.
And the reason that,

990
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:33.790
there's a bunch of reasons of why the scale of the rape of Nan king got

991
01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:36.050
downplayed.

992
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:40.520
One of them being at the now Chinese communist state was actually trying to

993
01:10:40.521 --> 01:10:43.370
build relationships with post war Japan.

994
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:49.510
So the massacre was quietly buried in and now you had the Chinese people were

995
01:10:50.901 --> 01:10:53.990
now in a communist state and there wasn't much speaking out to do.

996
01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:56.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

997
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:58.180
<v 0>And the Japanese downplayed the horrors</v>

998
01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.420
as saying it was a,
you know,
just another incident of war.

999
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:07.960
And some Japanese officials were quoted as saying,

1000
01:11:07.961 --> 01:11:12.010
it's a story made up by the Chinese.
It's tarnish the image of Japan.

1001
01:11:12.011 --> 01:11:12.844
But it was a lie.

1002
01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1003
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.650
<v 2>And they said things like,
I think the Nan king massacres ally,</v>

1004
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:23.630
the women that were raped were labeled as comfort women and licensed

1005
01:11:23.631 --> 01:11:24.800
prostitutes.

1006
01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:30.860
And many Japanese officials say that what happened in Nan king was just a part

1007
01:11:30.861 --> 01:11:31.694
of war.

1008
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:38.570
And there's a really clear example of downplaying not only the rape of Nan king,

1009
01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:42.780
but of the war in general.
And they put this,
some of this in the book,

1010
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:53.430
they're talking about the,
the Japanese education system.

1011
01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.560
Here we go back to the book.
The Japanese,

1012
01:11:55.590 --> 01:12:00.120
the entire Japanese education system suffers from selective amnesia for not

1013
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:05.100
until 1994 where Japanese school children taught that here he knows army was

1014
01:12:05.101 --> 01:12:08.820
responsible for the deaths of at least 20 million allied soldiers and Asian

1015
01:12:08.821 --> 01:12:12.590
civilians during World War II.
In the net.

1016
01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:17.660
In the early 1990s a newspaper article quoted a Japanese high school teacher who

1017
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:22.230
claimed that his students were surprised to learn that Japan had been at war

1018
01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:26.940
with the United States.
The first thing they wanted to know was who had one.

1019
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:34.390
In 1997 and 1977 the ministry of Education reduced a section on World War II

1020
01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:40.120
within a standard history book of several hundred pages to only six pages,

1021
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:44.840
which consisted mainly of pictures of American firebombing of Tokyo,

1022
01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.580
a picture of the ruins of Hiroshima and Itali of Japan's war dead.

1023
01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1024
01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.520
<v 2>The texts neglected dimension,
the casualties on the other side,</v>

1025
01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:59.530
Japanese war atrocities or the forced evacuations of Chinese and Korean

1026
01:12:59.531 --> 01:13:01.420
prisoners to labor camps in Japan.

1027
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:06.690
Much of the censorship might've gone on challenged had it not been for the

1028
01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:08.400
efforts of one brave crusader.

1029
01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:13.490
In 1965 the Japanese historian and Nigga Suburu sued the Japanese government.

1030
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:21.940
This lawsuit was the beginning of a legal battle that would span three decades

1031
01:13:21.941 --> 01:13:25.390
and gain the backing of thousands of sympathetic Japanese followers.

1032
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:32.460
The ministry interfered with a Neg as attempts to document the Nan king massacre

1033
01:13:32.461 --> 01:13:36.900
for school children.
For example,
in His textbook manuscript,
a Nega wrote,

1034
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.310
he wrote this quote immediately after the occupation of Nan King,

1035
01:13:41.311 --> 01:13:44.430
the Japanese army killed numerous Chinese soldiers and citizens.

1036
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:49.050
This incident became known as the as the Nan king massacre.

1037
01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:54.390
Now when when his book got checked by the examiner,

1038
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:57.210
the examiner commented,
quote,

1039
01:13:57.330 --> 01:14:01.410
readers might interpret this description has meeting meaning that the Japanese

1040
01:14:01.411 --> 01:14:05.100
army unilaterally massacred Chinese immediately after the occupation.

1041
01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:10.370
This passage should be revised that it is not interpreted in such a way

1042
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:19.390
and here's what the passage eventually got changed to while battling the fierce

1043
01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:21.940
resistance of the Chinese armed forces,

1044
01:14:21.941 --> 01:14:25.900
the Japanese occupied Nan king and killed numerous Chinese soldiers and

1045
01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:30.670
civilians.
This incident came to be known as the Nan King massacre,

1046
01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:35.350
that a statement and quote that a statement might have been satisfied.

1047
01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:38.950
That statement might have satisfied textbook sensors as a compromise between a

1048
01:14:38.951 --> 01:14:42.790
niggas argument and the ministry's position on the massacre.
Unfortunately,

1049
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:47.080
the statement is simply not true because it implies that the massacre occurred

1050
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.250
in the heat of battle.

1051
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.760
Continuing on.

1052
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:58.910
The examiner demanded that a nega delete his description of the rape itself,

1053
01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:03.150
claiming that the violation of women is something that has happened on every

1054
01:15:03.151 --> 01:15:05.640
battlefield in every era of human history.

1055
01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:10.080
This is not an issue that needs to be taken up with respect to the Japanese army

1056
01:15:10.081 --> 01:15:10.920
in particular.

1057
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:12.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1058
01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:15.930
<v 2>Even the word aggression was deemed taboo.
Aggression.</v>

1059
01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:20.960
The sensors wrote is a term that contains negative ethical connotations.

1060
01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1061
01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:29.120
<v 2>And that spirit that you can see very clearly,
that spirit of denial,</v>

1062
01:15:29.121 --> 01:15:33.830
it carried on,
which is why when this book came out,
this book,

1063
01:15:33.831 --> 01:15:35.750
the rape of Nanking when it came out,

1064
01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:40.520
there was still Japanese nationalists that were staunchly against it,

1065
01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:47.260
but Iris Chang who researched intently and wrote with passion,

1066
01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.260
she gave it all right does.

1067
01:15:53.261 --> 01:15:58.261
She was a daughter of Chinese American immigrants and her parents by the way had

1068
01:15:59.091 --> 01:16:01.700
connections to Nan King and an escape there

1069
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:09.570
and both her parents had made it to America and become college professors.

1070
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.330
And Iris was

1071
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:17.690
compelled to tell this story.

1072
01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.210
But like I said in the beginning,

1073
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:26.480
she was so close to this story that it took a toll of its own.

1074
01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.070
And she was a writer,
obviously.

1075
01:16:31.071 --> 01:16:34.880
She got her bachelor's degree in journalism and eventually a master's in writing

1076
01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:38.360
from Johns Hopkins University.
And

1077
01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.520
there's actually a book that's written about Iris.

1078
01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:48.060
And then the book is written by Iris,
his mother,

1079
01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.740
whose name is Dr Ying Ying Chiang.

1080
01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:57.510
And the book is called the woman who could not forget.

1081
01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:05.090
And I'm going to bring you through some portions of this book.

1082
01:17:05.671 --> 01:17:10.100
So this book,
again,
this is about Iris Chang and it's written

1083
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.210
<v 0>by her mother.
How she got</v>

1084
01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:15.790
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1085
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:20.520
<v 0>is now she decided she was gonna write about this.
Here we go,
quote.</v>

1086
01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:25.290
Although Iris talked to us about her many book ideas for her next book while she

1087
01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:26.430
was writing our first book,

1088
01:17:26.431 --> 01:17:31.290
her decision to write the rape of Nan king came all of a sudden in December,

1089
01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:35.010
1994 as iris told us and as described in the book,

1090
01:17:35.011 --> 01:17:39.570
she made her mind to write about this most atrocious chapter of history when she

1091
01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:43.980
was attending a conference in California on December 13th,

1092
01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.230
1994 at the conference,

1093
01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:51.180
there was a photo exhibition of the war of the war crimes committed in China in

1094
01:17:51.181 --> 01:17:55.530
the 1930s taken when the Japanese army invaded Chinese territory.

1095
01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.910
Iris wrote in her book,

1096
01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:00.870
though I had heard so much about the Nan king massacre as a child,

1097
01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.880
nothing prepared me for these pictures.

1098
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:07.080
Stark black and white images of decapitated heads,
Belize,

1099
01:18:07.081 --> 01:18:12.030
ripped open a nude women forced by their rapists into various pornographic
poses.

1100
01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:17.150
Their faces contort it into unforgettable expressions of agony and shame and she

1101
01:18:17.881 --> 01:18:20.220
continued in a single blinding moment.

1102
01:18:20.221 --> 01:18:23.700
I recognized that fragility of not just life,

1103
01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.340
but the human experience itself.

1104
01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:27.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1105
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:28.171
<v 0>Later.</v>

1106
01:18:28.171 --> 01:18:32.370
She told us in a telephone update that she simply must write about the rape of

1107
01:18:32.371 --> 01:18:33.750
Nanking for next book.

1108
01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:38.130
It was a moral obligation and it would be justice for the victims as well.

1109
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:42.510
In 1998 after the rape of Nan king had been published,

1110
01:18:42.511 --> 01:18:45.420
one Japanese reporter interviewed Iris and asked her,

1111
01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:50.430
why did you decide to write this book?
Irish replied,
when I was a little girl,

1112
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:53.580
my parents shocked me with the story of the rape of Nan King.

1113
01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:59.220
They told me that the Japanese imperial army massacred thousands of civilians in

1114
01:18:59.221 --> 01:19:02.460
the capital of China and butchered even small children.

1115
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.170
This left a powerful impression on me and I went to local libraries to learn

1116
01:19:07.171 --> 01:19:11.250
more details,
but I couldn't find a shred of information on the subject.

1117
01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:16.740
There was nothing in my local school libraries or public city libraries or in my

1118
01:19:16.741 --> 01:19:20.220
world history textbooks.
Still worse.

1119
01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.980
My teachers were completely ignorant of this event.

1120
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:24.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1121
01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:28.880
<v 0>The event remained a question mark in my mind for years until I saw an exhibit a</v>

1122
01:19:28.881 --> 01:19:33.881
for photographs on the subject in 1994 the horror of those photographs inspired

1123
01:19:34.621 --> 01:19:35.520
me to write the book.

1124
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1125
01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:40.590
<v 0>So that's how I</v>

1126
01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.060
got involved in writing the book and as a writer,

1127
01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:49.440
luckily she was also a prolific letter writer and I'm going to quote a bunch of

1128
01:19:49.441 --> 01:19:51.960
her letters because her mother saved a bunch of her letters.

1129
01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:57.270
And here is one that Kinda describes,

1130
01:19:57.271 --> 01:20:00.330
I think it's a good insight into what her personality was like when she was

1131
01:20:00.331 --> 01:20:01.260
actually writing the book.

1132
01:20:01.261 --> 01:20:06.060
This was a letter to her mom about what she was doing on a day to day basis as

1133
01:20:06.061 --> 01:20:08.100
she's writing this book.
And this was her second

1134
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.770
<v 2>book.
She,
so she'd already written one book.
It had done okay,</v>

1135
01:20:10.771 --> 01:20:12.690
but this one was her,
you know,

1136
01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:16.740
our current project and here's what she said about it.
On a typical day,

1137
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:20.580
I would rise between seven and 8:00 AM and take the bus to silver spring metro

1138
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:25.110
station.
Fortunately,
there was a bus stop directly across from Lee's house.

1139
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.130
The trip to the national archives took about 45 minutes on public transportation

1140
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:34.050
and the building was opened by 8:45 AM I spent my mornings in the military

1141
01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:39.051
reference branch of the archives on the 13th floor looking through finding aids

1142
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:43.680
and filling out cards to request boxes from different collections of papers.

1143
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:46.560
Dozens of boxes would be pulled from the shelves,

1144
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:50.100
placed on carts and made available to me in the second floor reading room,

1145
01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:54.240
which stayed open until 9:00 PM on Tuesdays,
Thursdays,
and Fridays.

1146
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:58.260
I was usually there in the afternoons and evenings scanning documents,

1147
01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.940
tagging the ones that pertained to the Nanking massacre and xeroxing them as

1148
01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:03.990
quickly as possible.

1149
01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.450
So she's digging deep into this book,

1150
01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:12.030
doing massive amount of research and you know,

1151
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:17.050
research back then was infinitely harder than it is now because we have the

1152
01:21:17.391 --> 01:21:20.780
Internet now.
As she began,
she,

1153
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:24.470
she assembled all this information and she was starting to starting to speak

1154
01:21:24.471 --> 01:21:27.410
about it,
starting to write some articles about it before the book came out.

1155
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:31.430
And she was interviewed by the San Jose Mercury News,

1156
01:21:31.431 --> 01:21:34.700
which was a big newspaper up in the South Bay area of,
you know,

1157
01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.330
South Bay San Francisco.
And uh,
she,

1158
01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.890
when she got done with that interview,

1159
01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:44.660
she started getting a little bit of recognition.
So here's a letter to her mom.

1160
01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:48.560
Dear mom,
here's the latest exciting news.

1161
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:53.240
I shall be the master of ceremonies for what I believe will be the biggest rape

1162
01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:54.800
of Nanking conference ever.

1163
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:59.120
The event will take place at Stanford University during the first weekend of

1164
01:21:59.121 --> 01:21:59.660
December.

1165
01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:03.830
Hundreds of people for more than 50 activist organizations all over the globe

1166
01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:08.120
will be there as well as representatives from all major news media organizations

1167
01:22:08.121 --> 01:22:09.860
of California,
China and Japan.

1168
01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:14.240
The goal of the three day affairs to discuss legal strategy.
How can we see,

1169
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:19.160
seek reparations for the victims through international law and UN resolutions?

1170
01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.990
How can we gather evidence of atrocity for,
of atrocities,
for lawsuits?

1171
01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.000
What methods should we use to force the Japanese to accept responsibility for

1172
01:22:29.001 --> 01:22:30.830
its past misdeeds?

1173
01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.560
So she's in the game.
She's getting after it.

1174
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:40.830
She starting to get some leadership positions in here and starting to get some

1175
01:22:41.891 --> 01:22:46.330
recognition now as she's continued to work.
Here's another letter to her mom.

1176
01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.360
Dear mom,
thank you for your inspirational email.

1177
01:22:49.361 --> 01:22:53.170
I've been working on my book all week and feel more confident about my material.

1178
01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:57.700
The sections of the book are so short that I organize each chapter as I would

1179
01:22:57.701 --> 01:22:58.534
have speech.

1180
01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:03.690
Thinking of the chapters as speeches forces me to distill each idea into a tiny

1181
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:05.740
hard gem.

1182
01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:12.340
Lately I've been reading so many of the world's classic speeches for

1183
01:23:12.341 --> 01:23:13.174
inspiration.

1184
01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:18.550
They are breathtaking in their power and so much more pungent than pros in the

1185
01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:19.384
evenings.

1186
01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:24.340
When I read the speeches of Napoleon or Clarence Darrow or Winston Churchill,

1187
01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:27.670
I feel engaged in the actual conversation with them.

1188
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:33.430
Words are the only way to preserve the essence of a soul.

1189
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:38.980
What excites me about speeches is that even after the speakers are dead and

1190
01:23:38.981 --> 01:23:43.270
buried,
their spirit lives on.
To me.

1191
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:48.310
This is true religion,
the best form of life after death.

1192
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:53.920
This is the first time I've ever devoted much attention to speeches.

1193
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.690
My previous reading had only consisted mainly of essays,
plays,

1194
01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:02.170
novels and poetry,
Love Iris,

1195
01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.450
so it's pretty cool that you,
first of all,

1196
01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:09.250
I love that letter because she's recognizing the power of speech and she's,

1197
01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:13.360
she's realizing that what she's doing as an author is that's,
that's her,

1198
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.870
that's her mark that she's going to leave on the world and it's very interesting

1199
01:24:16.871 --> 01:24:20.620
that yinging Chang is also an academic.
She's a,
you know,

1200
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:23.890
obviously a really smart person and they're able to have these sort of

1201
01:24:23.891 --> 01:24:28.891
intellectual conversations and in letters and they're all a really good insight

1202
01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.560
into what iris is mind,

1203
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:35.710
what was going through irises mind as she did this.

1204
01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:40.240
Now the book comes out,
there's,

1205
01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:43.150
it doesn't like jump out of the gates,

1206
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.330
but as it comes out there's a little bit of controversy about it.

1207
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:49.000
And so there started to be some articles about it and some interviews and she's

1208
01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.820
getting some interviews and the book starts to get some good traction

1209
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.131
back to the book.

1210
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:58.330
On January 14th she flew to Washington for a TV interview with PBS

1211
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.390
at the San Francisco Airport.

1212
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.530
She left a telephone message for us and said that she'd gotten a call from her

1213
01:25:05.531 --> 01:25:10.400
publisher and that her book was number 15 on the New York Times bestsellers

1214
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:13.360
list.
Her voice told us she was weeping.

1215
01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.870
I'm sure they were tears of Joy Shao Jin,

1216
01:25:16.871 --> 01:25:19.990
which is the dad and I were jubilant.

1217
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:25.120
We could not contain our excitement for many days and the next phone call we

1218
01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:27.550
said,
Iris,
you've made it.

1219
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:30.820
So Book Hits The New York Times bestseller.

1220
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:35.320
That's the game changer for Iris.
Back to the book on Eye.

1221
01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:40.240
On January 28th Irish called us with excitement and said that Laurel Cook,

1222
01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.630
her publicist and Jack Mckeown,

1223
01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:47.350
the CEO had called her in the afternoon to tell her that her book was up to

1224
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:49.090
number 11 on the New York Times list,

1225
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.340
her highest spot yet only two weeks after first making the list when they
called,

1226
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:57.790
she could hear wild cheering,
whistling and clapping in the background.

1227
01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:03.080
She was overjoyed.
So it's like the big,

1228
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.070
the big thing and

1229
01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:06.810
<v 0>as a writer is to make the New York Times list and,
and,</v>

1230
01:26:06.811 --> 01:26:10.310
and her parents understand that too because they're academics and you know,

1231
01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:12.860
they're,
they're super stoked for IRS.

1232
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:17.960
Now with the success starts to come,

1233
01:26:17.961 --> 01:26:21.410
some stress and that starts to reveal itself.

1234
01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:25.610
Here's another letter that she wrote.
Dear mom,

1235
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:30.500
I'm sorry that I sounded so rushed when you called me at Miriam's home.

1236
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.490
Sometimes I wonder if I've offended a lot of old friends in the last few months

1237
01:26:34.491 --> 01:26:35.630
by not returning emails,

1238
01:26:35.631 --> 01:26:40.631
phone calls and letters perhaps many people believe I've been corrupted already.

1239
01:26:43.650 --> 01:26:46.740
It's true that I've neglected my loved ones for the last few months.

1240
01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.190
I feel ashamed that I haven't yet brought,

1241
01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:53.220
bought you a mother's Day gift or even a card only.

1242
01:26:53.221 --> 01:26:57.360
This note that I am hastily writing from my laptop computer perched up on a bed

1243
01:26:57.570 --> 01:26:59.190
and Diana sacraments house.

1244
01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:05.100
How I wish you could have been there during the woman of the year ceremony.

1245
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:09.480
I told you,
I told the audience how you inspired me over the years,

1246
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.870
how you served as my first role model.
He's got another big award,

1247
01:27:12.871 --> 01:27:17.220
a woman of the year.
Right.
Please forgive me.
I love you dearly,

1248
01:27:17.221 --> 01:27:20.970
even though I haven't found the time to talk to you in the last few weeks,

1249
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:25.350
and in a few weeks we'll all be reunited and the book tour,

1250
01:27:25.351 --> 01:27:29.910
we'll finally be over.
I feel like a soldier returning from a six month war.

1251
01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.430
Love Iris.
So she's a person that feels guilt,

1252
01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:36.751
you know,
and,

1253
01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:40.230
and the idea that she hasn't been returned and emails and phone calls and she

1254
01:27:40.231 --> 01:27:43.080
feels bad about it.
And then I found this interesting,

1255
01:27:43.081 --> 01:27:45.750
perhaps many people believe I've been corrupted already.
Oh,

1256
01:27:45.751 --> 01:27:48.360
so you made it big time and now you're blowing me off.

1257
01:27:49.410 --> 01:27:50.820
She's feeling that pressure too.

1258
01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.150
Back to the book.
When Iris is book became an international bestseller,

1259
01:27:58.330 --> 01:28:02.770
she reached the status.
Most writers can only dream of it.
She became a celebrity.

1260
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:04.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1261
01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:08.490
<v 0>But she also paid a price for it in February,</v>

1262
01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:12.510
1998 after a long book tour,
she had already told us that once she came home,

1263
01:28:12.511 --> 01:28:14.100
she did not want to go out anymore.

1264
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:18.480
All she wanted to do was stay home with Brett.
That was her husband.

1265
01:28:18.481 --> 01:28:20.940
She'd been married now and have a good sleep.

1266
01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:26.310
After several weeks of continuous book signings,
public speeches,
and traveling,

1267
01:28:26.311 --> 01:28:30.900
she said her life was nonstop blur of airport,
Lecture Hall,
Hotel,

1268
01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.970
airport,
Lecture Hall Hotel.

1269
01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.290
The responses to her speeches were overwhelming.
Wherever she went,

1270
01:28:37.410 --> 01:28:41.220
people besieged her after every speech.
When she came home,

1271
01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:44.160
she never really came down with a cold or a flu,

1272
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:46.530
only recover in time for the next book tour.

1273
01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:51.810
She was physically exhausted.
Not only that,

1274
01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:57.000
but during the book signings,
many old Asian people came up to her Chinese,

1275
01:28:57.001 --> 01:29:00.180
Korean,
Filipino,
Singaporean,
Indian.

1276
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:02.220
They poured their personal stories

1277
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.460
<v 2>of suffering during World War Two and in Asia to her,</v>

1278
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:10.620
some of them wept and thanked her for profusely for writing such a book.

1279
01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:11.371
They said,

1280
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:15.210
it's so frustrating to see that Japan to this day hasn't formally acknowledged

1281
01:29:15.211 --> 01:29:17.220
their war crimes.
They exclaimed,

1282
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:21.720
it's about time I ever said all of that.
On the one hand,

1283
01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:25.980
she felt rewarded that she was sought out and greatly respected by many people,

1284
01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:30.450
but on the other hand,
he was mentally and emotionally drained.

1285
01:29:30.451 --> 01:29:35.130
After hearing those stories on June 29th,

1286
01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:36.720
1998 Irish wrote,
dear mom,

1287
01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:40.650
I arrived safely in New York today after giving a well received speech in

1288
01:29:40.651 --> 01:29:42.840
Baltimore to the women doctors.

1289
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:48.640
Actually it was very depressing during the Q and a.

1290
01:29:48.641 --> 01:29:52.650
A Pakistani doctor told the audience about the atrocities against Bengali women

1291
01:29:52.651 --> 01:29:57.651
in 1971 a Filipino doctor described how she escaped the rape of Manila when she

1292
01:29:57.691 --> 01:30:02.691
was 12 and an Indian doctor had discussed the Indian tradition of Sooty,

1293
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.430
which is the burning of widows alive.

1294
01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:10.920
Others talked about the interaction,
international sex slave industry,

1295
01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:15.660
the trafficking of women and children,
female genital mutilation in Africa.

1296
01:30:15.930 --> 01:30:17.160
You get the idea.

1297
01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.410
It seemed there were endless gruesome stories that people were eager to share

1298
01:30:22.411 --> 01:30:23.244
with her

1299
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:32.730
on top of her busy schedule of book tours outside.

1300
01:30:32.731 --> 01:30:36.330
People might not realize that besides her traveling signings in books and

1301
01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:37.040
speeches,

1302
01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.980
she was constantly bombarded with additional email request from news reporters

1303
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.300
for written interviews.

1304
01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.200
Sometimes there were 10 or 15 written questions for her to answers so the

1305
01:30:46.201 --> 01:30:48.260
reporters could write a news article and profile.

1306
01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.220
I risked to still could find time to answer those questions accordingly.

1307
01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:55.920
So she's just,
uh,
she's just to go get her right.

1308
01:30:55.921 --> 01:30:58.650
She's not stopping regardless of what's happening.

1309
01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:04.080
And now as this book is gained,
all this popularity,

1310
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:07.110
now she's starting to get some attacks as well from,
like I said,

1311
01:31:07.111 --> 01:31:09.890
from the Japanese nationalists that are saying,
Oh,
this didn't happen.
You're,

1312
01:31:09.891 --> 01:31:12.720
you're glorifying it or you're making it sound like worse than it was.

1313
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.660
And here's the letter that you wrote.
Dear mom,

1314
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.400
tonight I read an article about John Stomberg Steinbeck's life in the,

1315
01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:24.560
in the Los Gatos mountain area and learn that the reception of the Grapes of

1316
01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:29.580
Wrath mirrored that of the rape of Nan King in a letter to a friend.

1317
01:31:29.581 --> 01:31:34.581
Steinbeck wrote the vilification of me out here from the large landowners and

1318
01:31:34.621 --> 01:31:35.850
bankers is pretty bad.

1319
01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:41.600
The latest rumor started by them that the Okies hate me for lying about them.

1320
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:46.650
So I'm frightened at the rolling might have this thing.

1321
01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.560
It is completely out of hand.
I mean,

1322
01:31:49.561 --> 01:31:54.561
the kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy love Iris.

1323
01:31:55.231 --> 01:32:00.010
So she feels the same way that she's starting to.
This book is almost becoming

1324
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.600
<v 0>more powerful than she,
you know,
more,
more than she can control.</v>

1325
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:08.590
And here's another,
another letter that she wrote

1326
01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:15.090
a few nights ago.
I leafed through Richard Rhodes autobiography,

1327
01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:19.560
a hole in the world after our lunch together.
As you know,

1328
01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:21.990
Rhodes was starved,
beaten,

1329
01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:27.170
and psychologically abused as a child by his step mother.

1330
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:32.070
His mother had committed suicide by shooting herself and his father degenerated

1331
01:32:32.071 --> 01:32:36.090
into an alcoholic,
leaving him virtually incapable of protecting his family.

1332
01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.580
Every time I reread this book,

1333
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:43.410
I'm convinced that Richard Rhodes is lucky to be alive.
He was a genuine victim,

1334
01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:48.960
but even his experience pales in comparison to the stories of abandoned children

1335
01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:53.010
in the PRC orphanages.
That's People's Republic of China.

1336
01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:55.800
I don't even want to get into that right now.

1337
01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:00.870
Delving into history into other people's stories,
places,

1338
01:33:00.871 --> 01:33:05.160
all our problems into perspective time and again,

1339
01:33:05.161 --> 01:33:09.300
we have to remind ourselves how extraordinarily lucky we are.

1340
01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:14.460
Much love Iris.
Clearly.

1341
01:33:14.461 --> 01:33:16.890
That's something that I talk about on a regular basis.

1342
01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:21.360
You look at the suffering that other people go through and it reminds you of how

1343
01:33:21.361 --> 01:33:24.510
lucky we are not to be in those situations,

1344
01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:30.620
but it seemed like I was was having a hard time maintaining that positive

1345
01:33:31.411 --> 01:33:34.950
outlook and she's keeps getting dragged down into the darkness.

1346
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:42.360
Back to the book,
hearing that peanuts cartoonists,

1347
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:44.040
Charles Schultz had died.

1348
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:49.080
Iris was quite sentimental and wrote me a letter and here's the letter quote.

1349
01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.050
Dear mom,
I have a favorite ask you.

1350
01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:56.400
Can you save the last peanuts comic strip that appeared yesterday and mail it to

1351
01:33:56.401 --> 01:34:00.540
me?
I'm still reeling from the news of Charles Schulz is death.

1352
01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.030
It's the end of an era.

1353
01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.710
I still remember all the hours I spent reading peanuts books as a child.

1354
01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:11.820
Do you recall the time we went together to a garage sale and champagne and you

1355
01:34:11.821 --> 01:34:13.950
brought me my first snoopy cartoon book,

1356
01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:16.680
a used paper back already yellow with age.

1357
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:19.950
That's when I first fell in love with the peanuts comic strip.

1358
01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:24.480
You and dad grew up with a PM peanuts cartoon as well in Chinese new pit

1359
01:34:24.481 --> 01:34:27.990
newspapers and Taiwan making both of you part of the peanuts era as well.

1360
01:34:28.890 --> 01:34:30.390
Years later in Santa Barbara,

1361
01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:35.660
I met Charles Soldier in person at the SB writer's conference during his

1362
01:34:36.451 --> 01:34:39.780
lecture.
However,
I was surprised by his demeanor,
which was bitter,

1363
01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:44.250
gloomy and depressed,
almost nasty.
After his lecture,

1364
01:34:44.610 --> 01:34:48.600
I stood in a long line waiting for Schultz to autograph a copy of his book.

1365
01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.580
When I finally stood in front of him,

1366
01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.850
I asked Schulte if I could write a profile about him for the New Yorker or some

1367
01:34:53.851 --> 01:34:58.070
other major match magazine.
Why is young person like

1368
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:02.450
<v 2>you interested in an old man like me was his response?
At the time,</v>

1369
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.160
I thought he was being sarcastic,

1370
01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.930
but later I learned that Schultz like Charlie Brown is a terribly insecure

1371
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:12.530
person,
fundamentally convinced of his own unworthiness.

1372
01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.910
That was the last time I ever spoke.
I ever saw Schultz,

1373
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:21.590
but last year I had one more opportunity to see him.
To make a long story short,

1374
01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.280
I didn't have time to make the long two hour drive to Santa Rosa and I figured I

1375
01:35:25.281 --> 01:35:28.070
would see Schultes at the next Santa Barbara's writer's conference.

1376
01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.110
I never expected that Schultes would pass away.
Only a few months later.

1377
01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:34.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1378
01:35:34.330 --> 01:35:36.970
<v 2>Do you think Charles Schultz committed suicide?</v>

1379
01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:41.740
Don't you find it odd that he died the night before his final strip ran in the

1380
01:35:41.741 --> 01:35:43.780
Sunday newspaper has,
you know,

1381
01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:48.960
peanuts ran from 1950 to 2000 a perfect 50 years and he died right when the

1382
01:35:50.081 --> 01:35:50.920
strip ended,

1383
01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:55.660
but life is seldom as neat and tidy as a cartoon box.

1384
01:35:55.810 --> 01:36:00.810
It's almost as if he timed his dramatic exit from this world achieving his final

1385
01:36:00.881 --> 01:36:04.360
deadline.
Love Iris,

1386
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:08.150
continue going.

1387
01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:12.890
It seems like Iris could not get the death of Charles shirts shorts off her mind

1388
01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:16.610
the next day.
She wrote to me again about him,
dear mom,

1389
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:20.630
I think it was Charles Salts is pessimism as well as the ability to understand

1390
01:36:20.631 --> 01:36:24.980
human failure,
insecurity,
heartbreak that made millions love peanuts.

1391
01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:26.720
You're absolutely right.

1392
01:36:26.721 --> 01:36:31.010
Schultes had no reason whatsoever to be depressed after achieving wealth and

1393
01:36:31.011 --> 01:36:35.780
fame at such an early age.
But depression is not rational.

1394
01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:40.040
Perhaps he did have a mental problem or some chemically induced condition,

1395
01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.090
but whatever it was,

1396
01:36:41.091 --> 01:36:44.360
it prevented him from losing touch with the underdogs of the world.

1397
01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:45.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1398
01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:50.520
<v 2>It's strange,
but I still feel a void in my heart after Schulze his death,</v>

1399
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:54.120
even though I never knew him and didn't particularly like him after our meeting

1400
01:36:54.121 --> 01:36:56.370
in person,
it made me wonder,

1401
01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:59.220
what is the secret to Shults is magic appeal?

1402
01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:05.100
The answer I believe is simple.
Schultes understands a heart of a loser.

1403
01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:10.160
He capture those moments in life when we feel utterly unload,

1404
01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:12.360
unloved,
unwanted,

1405
01:37:12.630 --> 01:37:15.600
and alone all of us,

1406
01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:20.970
no matter how successful have felt like losers at some point in life.

1407
01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:22.880
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1408
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.230
<v 2>Love Iris.
So you're starting to see there's a,</v>

1409
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:31.750
there's a
an indication,
right?
There's an indication.

1410
01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:36.290
She's sort of seeing things like depression.
You other people,

1411
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:40.040
regardless of,
you know,
how successful they are.
And at this point,
you know,

1412
01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:42.770
she's in New York Times bestseller and woman of the year,
all this other stuff.

1413
01:37:42.771 --> 01:37:47.390
So she's successful and yet she's recognizing how that doesn't really mean

1414
01:37:47.391 --> 01:37:51.890
anything and you can still be depressed.

1415
01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:56.220
After 11th

1416
01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:00.930
<v 1>2001 she wrote this,
Oh,
a few days after it,</v>

1417
01:38:00.931 --> 01:38:05.310
she wrote this again to her mom and dad.
In this case,

1418
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.360
quote,
events are unfolding faster than I can react to them.

1419
01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:15.030
First the WTC and Pentagon tragedies.
Then the Japanese prime ministers,

1420
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:19.830
unexpected apology to the comfort women and now a major court victory of a

1421
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:23.490
former Korean slave labor against the Japanese corporation.

1422
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:29.100
This week I tried to work on my book and recover from General Exhaustion and a

1423
01:38:29.101 --> 01:38:33.570
mild case of the flu,
but I have to admit it's hard to stay focused.

1424
01:38:34.410 --> 01:38:38.610
I plan to do nothing more than right and exercise and rest for the next few

1425
01:38:38.610 --> 01:38:40.050
weeks.
Love Iris.

1426
01:38:41.110 --> 01:38:44.920
<v 2>So she's now working on her next book.
Still working hard,</v>

1427
01:38:45.010 --> 01:38:48.640
probably working too hard,
not focusing enough.

1428
01:38:48.670 --> 01:38:52.930
And her mom now she's got a kid as well and we know that adding a kid into the

1429
01:38:52.931 --> 01:38:55.570
mix doesn't make things,
you know,
that doesn't give you more free time.

1430
01:38:55.571 --> 01:39:00.040
We can promise you that.
And she's married now.

1431
01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:01.690
She has a son and

1432
01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:03.270
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1433
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:06.960
<v 2>her mom actually started like putting some pressure on him.
He said,
hey,
you know,</v>

1434
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.000
you got a kid now you got to spend,
you know,

1435
01:39:09.001 --> 01:39:12.420
maybe you're going a little overboard with the work.

1436
01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:13.533
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1437
01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.900
<v 2>Back to the book on October 3rd,
2003 and an email,</v>

1438
01:39:16.901 --> 01:39:20.020
I asked iris whether she was putting too much emphasis on her career,

1439
01:39:20.021 --> 01:39:23.800
placing your career before her family.
She replied,
that is not true.

1440
01:39:24.490 --> 01:39:27.970
It's just that I believe that I have some power to shape my destiny and I want

1441
01:39:27.971 --> 01:39:29.740
Christopher t.
That's the sun.

1442
01:39:29.770 --> 01:39:34.480
I want Christopher to have his mother a strong to have in his mother a strong

1443
01:39:34.481 --> 01:39:38.050
role model.
A person who is his own individual,

1444
01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:40.000
impervious to the whims of others.

1445
01:39:40.810 --> 01:39:45.190
I cannot teach Christopher to be an intellectual and a socially responsible

1446
01:39:45.191 --> 01:39:49.240
person unless I demonstrate to him through my actions that I myself am such a

1447
01:39:49.241 --> 01:39:53.950
person.
I want to teach Christopher,
that it is far better to be long

1448
01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:59.440
to the critical minority than the unquestioning majority.

1449
01:39:59.770 --> 01:40:03.250
I want to teach him the ability to think independently,

1450
01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:08.110
to evaluate ideas and information on his own without the official sanction of

1451
01:40:08.111 --> 01:40:09.970
the authorities and if possible,

1452
01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:15.150
to create these qualities are not universally popular in our society.

1453
01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.450
My tendency to stand alone,

1454
01:40:17.451 --> 01:40:22.451
apart from the crowd has caused me a great pain and suffering throughout my

1455
01:40:22.881 --> 01:40:27.350
life,
but in the end I am stronger and better person because of it.

1456
01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.693
Now

1457
01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.590
she's continued all and she's continuing to just kind of grind and grind and

1458
01:40:39.591 --> 01:40:42.770
grind and there's an incident.

1459
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:47.223
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1460
01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:50.650
<v 2>she's gone on a trip to Louisville,</v>

1461
01:40:50.651 --> 01:40:55.210
Kentucky and things start going sideways.
Back to the book.

1462
01:40:55.211 --> 01:40:58.060
That night we went to sleep and assume that iris would be all right,

1463
01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.900
but about 2:00 AM California time in the early morning of Friday,

1464
01:41:01.901 --> 01:41:04.780
August 13th we are awakened by a phone call.

1465
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:07.060
I picked up the phone and it was iris.

1466
01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.450
Her voice was shaking and she told me she'd seen some frightening pictures on

1467
01:41:10.451 --> 01:41:15.070
the TV in her hotel room,
iris and I then had a conversation about this.

1468
01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:18.100
Apparently she could not fall asleep,
so she turned on the TV.

1469
01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.890
I asked her what kind of pictures were on the TV screen.

1470
01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.090
She said it showed some horrible atrocities and ugly images of children torn

1471
01:41:25.091 --> 01:41:26.230
apart by wars.

1472
01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:27.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1473
01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.450
<v 2>She said that the TV was showing something similar to scenes from hell like an</v>

1474
01:41:31.451 --> 01:41:35.970
automatic and world war three
she had turned off their TV,

1475
01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:36.900
waited a while,

1476
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.590
and then turn it on again to find the ugly images had disappeared.

1477
01:41:41.670 --> 01:41:45.450
I responded that maybe the TV had been showing a war movie.
It's very possible.

1478
01:41:45.451 --> 01:41:47.130
I said that during the wee hours of the night,

1479
01:41:47.131 --> 01:41:50.550
TV stations would show such a genre of horror films.

1480
01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:56.040
Then Iris told me she did not feel things had been quite right.

1481
01:41:56.041 --> 01:41:58.980
From the very moment she'd arrived at the hotel,

1482
01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:03.780
the clerk at the front desk looks suspicious to her and spoke to a person who

1483
01:42:03.781 --> 01:42:06.360
later kept looking at the window of her room.

1484
01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:09.750
While Iris was still talking with me on the phone,

1485
01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.920
she told me that she could still see that person standing outside on the lawn in

1486
01:42:13.921 --> 01:42:15.360
front,
not far from her room.

1487
01:42:15.930 --> 01:42:19.650
He looked at her window and as she peered through her curtain,

1488
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:25.550
she told me she spoke to her room was wired and that what she had seen on TV was

1489
01:42:25.591 --> 01:42:29.820
real and intentionally show to threaten her.
So she's getting paranoid.

1490
01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:33.180
He's paranoid that Japanese nationalists are coming after her.

1491
01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:36.840
She's had is starting to affect her mind.
Back to the book,

1492
01:42:36.841 --> 01:42:40.500
it was past 5:00 AM in Kentucky.
I asked her had she gotten any sleep at all.

1493
01:42:40.590 --> 01:42:44.040
She said she couldn't fall asleep and she was exhausted and had a terrible

1494
01:42:44.041 --> 01:42:45.330
headache.
She was sick.

1495
01:42:45.331 --> 01:42:49.890
I could tell she had to be ill because she had not been able to sleep for three

1496
01:42:49.891 --> 01:42:51.600
or four days prior to the trip.

1497
01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:52.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1498
01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:55.550
<v 2>She also had not eaten,
nor has she drunk any liquid for some time.</v>

1499
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:59.540
She said she'd ordered some takeout dinner that was delivered to her room,

1500
01:42:59.930 --> 01:43:02.780
but she did not have any appetite and hadn't eaten anything.

1501
01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:07.820
She didn't want to drink anything either afraid that someone might poison her.

1502
01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:13.660
I knew that under severe sleep deprivation people could have delusions,

1503
01:43:16.330 --> 01:43:19.510
so her parents decide they're gonna,

1504
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:22.750
they're gonna fly while she has a breakdown and they get a call saying,
hey,

1505
01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.890
something happened at Iris.
You need to get out here.
They fly out to Louisville.

1506
01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:31.570
As soon as they get to Louisville,
they go to the hospital.
When she gets to,

1507
01:43:31.571 --> 01:43:34.360
when they get to the hospital,
she,
they,

1508
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:39.520
they go to find her and she's in the psychiatric unit and they,

1509
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:42.160
she was sent to the psychiatric unit because they hadn't found anything wrong

1510
01:43:42.161 --> 01:43:44.990
with her physically,
which you know,
would include in my opinion.

1511
01:43:44.991 --> 01:43:48.580
And that includes like,
hey,
she's not dehydrated.
She's not starving.

1512
01:43:48.581 --> 01:43:50.380
She's got some psychiatric issues.

1513
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:55.760
So back to the book in the evening,
the doctor finally came in and met with us.

1514
01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:00.320
He briefed us on iris has conditioned in front of all of us.
He believed iris.

1515
01:44:00.321 --> 01:44:04.550
It experienced a so called a brief reactive psychosis due to stress conditions

1516
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:06.080
such as lack of sleep and food.

1517
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:12.520
He added that her condition could also be a possible onset of bipolar disorder

1518
01:44:13.041 --> 01:44:17.240
and recommended that I receive a doctor for followup.
After her return home,

1519
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:22.790
he gave us a reference.
He also prescribed an antipsychotic drug,

1520
01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:25.700
drug,
Risperdal,
Risperdal,

1521
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:30.170
two milligrams a day for Iris to take for at least a year.

1522
01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.460
<v 3>And then they,
they</v>

1523
01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:37.660
<v 2>getting the cab and as she'd get in the cab,</v>

1524
01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:41.470
she's kind of like making statements and saying strange things about what she

1525
01:44:41.471 --> 01:44:44.440
sees.
Billboards,
she's making strange comments about them.

1526
01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:49.420
And finally they landed San Jose airport and go back to the book we called

1527
01:44:49.421 --> 01:44:53.590
Michael and that's the,
that's uh,
the sun or irises brother.

1528
01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:56.470
We called Michael to come pick us up while we're waiting for Michael.

1529
01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.870
I read said that she felt dizzy and had a headache.

1530
01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:01.090
She told me that things seem distorted there,

1531
01:45:01.091 --> 01:45:04.870
her and that the expressions of people around her were strange.

1532
01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:06.101
At that time.

1533
01:45:06.101 --> 01:45:10.350
We did not know how powerful psychiatric drugs were and thought that iris,

1534
01:45:10.351 --> 01:45:14.230
his behavior was strange.
I later realized that while in the hospital,

1535
01:45:14.231 --> 01:45:19.180
Irish had been given heavy doses of risperdol and a tranquilizer to calm her

1536
01:45:19.181 --> 01:45:22.690
down.
The side effects of psychiatric drugs could be severe.

1537
01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:27.040
That explained why she felt dizzy and had a headache and distortion of a visual

1538
01:45:27.041 --> 01:45:27.874
perception.

1539
01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:34.030
So she's now on these drugs.
She's,

1540
01:45:34.090 --> 01:45:38.830
she's taking the,
the risk beer drawl,
two milligrams a day,

1541
01:45:39.190 --> 01:45:44.190
the medicines making her super sleepy and once they're back in the bay area,

1542
01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:49.780
the mom,
uh,
yinging starts looking for,
uh,
you know,

1543
01:45:49.781 --> 01:45:54.490
a board certified psychiatrist to bring her to and she ends up with this guy

1544
01:45:54.491 --> 01:45:58.570
that they called doctor B back to the book at Iris,

1545
01:45:58.571 --> 01:46:00.370
who is now seeing Dr be once a week.

1546
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:02.830
And she persuaded him to reduce her dose shoots,

1547
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:08.070
dosage of risk per girl risperdol by half from one milligram or from to one

1548
01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:12.220
milligram,
from,
from two down to one.

1549
01:46:13.090 --> 01:46:14.530
From the very beginning,

1550
01:46:14.590 --> 01:46:18.790
iris did not like to take any drugs and she kept trying to reduce the dosage or

1551
01:46:18.791 --> 01:46:20.020
stop it entirely.

1552
01:46:20.530 --> 01:46:24.610
The rest of the family was hoping that with the Risperdol,

1553
01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:28.780
iris would be less depressed,
but to no avail.
There was no difference.

1554
01:46:28.810 --> 01:46:32.410
So interestingly,
IRS is saying,
hey,
I don't want to take this drug.
You know,

1555
01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:36.490
I want to get off of it.
And they're all saying,
look,
just keep taking it.
And

1556
01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:42.730
eventually he just,
he prescribes her with another drug,

1557
01:46:42.731 --> 01:46:47.350
which is called amplify.
And as soon as,
or back to the book,

1558
01:46:47.351 --> 01:46:51.810
as soon as Irish took the amplify milligrams that she became excessively sleepy,

1559
01:46:51.811 --> 01:46:56.160
she could sleep for 12 hours or more straight.
So now she's sleeping,

1560
01:46:56.250 --> 01:47:00.840
I mean 12 hours a day,
bad.
And back to the book,

1561
01:47:00.841 --> 01:47:04.260
I always felt that her illness and inability to take care of Christopher was a

1562
01:47:04.261 --> 01:47:06.570
burden to everyone.
Something she hated.

1563
01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:10.080
I could see that she was very sad and felt helpless.

1564
01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:15.900
So this continues on.
And finally they go back to a meeting with doctor B.
Doctor,

1565
01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:18.900
be stunned us all with what he said next in a very serious tone.

1566
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:23.250
He said he thought iris condition was very grave and he suggested that iris

1567
01:47:23.251 --> 01:47:24.750
check into a recovery facility.

1568
01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:28.350
He said that the facility was in Saulsalito near the beach.

1569
01:47:28.650 --> 01:47:33.000
It was quite ideal for mental patients to recuperate.
As soon as iris heard this,

1570
01:47:33.001 --> 01:47:34.740
she immediately showed her disapproval.

1571
01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:38.640
I could understand her suspicion of any facility designed for so called mental

1572
01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:39.474
patients.

1573
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.650
She had learned many historical instances of government persecution of political

1574
01:47:43.651 --> 01:47:44.484
dissidence.

1575
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:49.410
One way was to put those dissidents into mental institutions and abused them,

1576
01:47:49.411 --> 01:47:53.580
sometimes leading to death.
I did not blame her for her suspicions.

1577
01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.660
She was already suspecting that evil forces were at work against her for what

1578
01:47:57.661 --> 01:48:02.280
she had written and done in the name of justice Dr B,

1579
01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:06.120
she told Dr [inaudible] that she did not think her mental state was that bad and

1580
01:48:06.121 --> 01:48:08.460
that she didn't need to go to a recovery facility,

1581
01:48:10.170 --> 01:48:15.170
so they start looking for someone else to take her to besides doctor B and now

1582
01:48:18.001 --> 01:48:23.001
she gets prescribed another drug which is called Selectsa and so she's on Alexa

1583
01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.920
and she's on an apple fi and back to the book at this time,

1584
01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:35.850
or sorry,
Abilify.
At this time,

1585
01:48:35.851 --> 01:48:39.300
Iris was already experiencing the strong side effects of Abilify,

1586
01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:42.660
most obvious where her lack of energy and the fact that she was drowsy all the

1587
01:48:42.661 --> 01:48:45.240
time.
In addition,
when she woke up from her daily naps,

1588
01:48:45.241 --> 01:48:47.490
she complained that her shoulders and leg joints were sore,

1589
01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:52.230
which were new symptoms that she thought likely to have been caused by the drug.

1590
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:57.720
I was worried about the side effects of Abilify and voiced my concern to doctor

1591
01:48:57.721 --> 01:49:01.680
B.
He said the dosage was the lowest possible and that the side effects would

1592
01:49:01.681 --> 01:49:04.860
gradually disappear.
In retrospect,

1593
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:09.060
it appears to us that Abilify had a big impact on irises,
mental state.

1594
01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.100
It was a turning point in her condition became worse after she started taking

1595
01:49:14.101 --> 01:49:19.101
the Abilify and late and then later worsened and even more with Selectsa.

1596
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:28.050
So now a another incident takes place.

1597
01:49:29.010 --> 01:49:32.820
She kind of disappears for a little bit.
No one really knows where she is.

1598
01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:35.400
They call the cops to find out.

1599
01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:40.290
Eventually she calls back and she says,
Hey,
look,

1600
01:49:40.291 --> 01:49:43.680
I was out.
I was tired.
I checked into a hotel to get some sleep.

1601
01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:46.530
That's the story she tells and she's,

1602
01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:50.530
her mom says she sounds guilty as she's trying to tell this story.

1603
01:49:51.190 --> 01:49:53.680
And then a few days later they,

1604
01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:58.710
they find the some sleeping pills and a bottle of vodka and they're kind of

1605
01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:04.360
realized that she was,
do you know,

1606
01:50:04.361 --> 01:50:06.370
thinking about committing suicide?
But you know,

1607
01:50:06.371 --> 01:50:10.270
her mom says she probably just went into a room to do that and fell asleep when

1608
01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:14.980
she woke up.
I guess she changed her mind and you know,

1609
01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:17.800
back to the book here on the drugs that she was taken.

1610
01:50:17.801 --> 01:50:22.210
We now know that Abilify website warns that the drug can affect your judgment

1611
01:50:22.211 --> 01:50:26.230
thinking or motor skills as well as the side effects of increasing risk of

1612
01:50:26.231 --> 01:50:29.350
suicide,
drowsiness,
anxiety and muscle stiffness.

1613
01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:34.420
And the Selectsa wa website warns about suicide,
anxiety

1614
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:39.670
and self destructive or aggressive impulses.

1615
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:43.540
So these drugs that you take for these problems have side effects that sound,

1616
01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:46.930
you know,
worse than what the problem is.

1617
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:51.910
Then she goes on to say that that the first attempted suicide that she made,

1618
01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:54.310
so this,
this attempt was a when she was,

1619
01:50:54.311 --> 01:50:59.311
when she was on 10 milligrams of Abilify and the other thing that that mentions

1620
01:50:59.891 --> 01:51:04.891
in these about these drugs is that when you change prescription,

1621
01:51:05.231 --> 01:51:08.320
when you change doses or you go on or off of them,

1622
01:51:08.321 --> 01:51:10.420
that's when you're most vulnerable.

1623
01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:16.140
And so that suicide attempt was inline with one of those changes.

1624
01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:28.180
So they go back to now that with another doctor doc who they called Doctor See,

1625
01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:31.680
going back to the book I read,

1626
01:51:31.681 --> 01:51:34.980
stopped taking selects on October 7th after the support group meeting,

1627
01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:38.130
she told Dr [inaudible] on the phone that she would discontinue seeing him if he

1628
01:51:38.131 --> 01:51:41.190
insisted on are taking the med medicine as a compromise.

1629
01:51:41.191 --> 01:51:45.270
Doctor C persuaded her to continue seeing him and then he would decide whether

1630
01:51:45.271 --> 01:51:49.380
she could gradually decrease the dosage of Risperdol,
which she was still on.

1631
01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:54.180
All of us told Iris that both the medication and the psychotherapy sessions were

1632
01:51:54.181 --> 01:51:57.900
needed for rapid recovery.
If she didn't want to take the medication,

1633
01:51:58.110 --> 01:51:59.310
then at least she should have.

1634
01:51:59.730 --> 01:52:02.100
She should have psychotherapy sessions with the doctor.

1635
01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:07.020
She agreed to continue seeing Dr. See,
looking back at what ended up happening,

1636
01:52:07.110 --> 01:52:11.400
it was so ironic.
I risk was the one who did not want to take the medication,

1637
01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:15.570
whereas the rest of the family believed in doctors and thought the medication

1638
01:52:15.571 --> 01:52:16.404
would help her.

1639
01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:28.630
Continuing on the morning of Thursday,
October 21st when I went to see her,

1640
01:52:28.631 --> 01:52:31.930
she was very unhappy and complained that I was following her too closely.

1641
01:52:33.190 --> 01:52:35.020
I found she had not eaten well the night before,

1642
01:52:35.021 --> 01:52:38.410
so I suggested going out for lunch.

1643
01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:42.670
We drove to nearby restaurant in the parking lot.
When she stopped the car,

1644
01:52:42.671 --> 01:52:47.671
she sat there and told me without any expression that she wanted to cry but had

1645
01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:52.040
no tears.
Her face was greenish and in a horrible,

1646
01:52:52.041 --> 01:52:54.740
depressed state at this time.

1647
01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:57.620
She had already mentioned that she did not want to live anymore.

1648
01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:02.450
I also noticed that her arm and leg movements and facial expressions were rigid

1649
01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:08.540
and it seemed even worse that she wanted to cry but had no tears

1650
01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:10.730
back then.

1651
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:15.730
I did not suspect that all of these symptoms could be the serious side effects

1652
01:53:17.150 --> 01:53:18.380
of the medications.

1653
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:30.910
Iris began to feel hopeless.

1654
01:53:31.210 --> 01:53:36.210
I later realized she wanted to carry out her plan and she did not want us to

1655
01:53:36.221 --> 01:53:39.370
find out in the last week of her life.

1656
01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:41.440
She prohibited me from visiting her.

1657
01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:47.060
She would not even want me to call her and did not return my calls or my emails.

1658
01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:49.780
In that final week,

1659
01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:54.910
Shao Jin and I took a walk ourselves to ease our worries.

1660
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:58.030
I went to a Palo Alto support group on Wednesday,

1661
01:53:58.031 --> 01:54:02.620
November 3rd Shao Jin and I went to another support group in San Jose.
On Friday,

1662
01:54:02.621 --> 01:54:07.621
November 5th we tried to gather information on how to deal with depression and

1663
01:54:08.081 --> 01:54:12.880
loved ones who are possibly suicidal
for all this time.

1664
01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:15.730
She was actively planning her final exit.

1665
01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:19.570
While we tried to find a way to rescue her,

1666
01:54:22.110 --> 01:54:26.490
we raced against her and we did not realize that she would carry out her plan so

1667
01:54:26.491 --> 01:54:27.324
quickly.

1668
01:54:28.410 --> 01:54:33.060
One week later on November 9th she was gone.

1669
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:39.623
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1670
01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:46.460
<v 2>and here is the note that was found</v>

1671
01:54:48.530 --> 01:54:49.910
next to irises computer.

1672
01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:56.000
Dear Brett,
mom,
Dad,

1673
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:59.450
and Mike for the last few weeks,

1674
01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:03.920
I've been struggling with my decision as to whether I should live or die.

1675
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:09.610
As I mentioned to Brett,
when you believe you have a future,

1676
01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:13.510
you think of terms of generations and years.

1677
01:55:15.130 --> 01:55:19.570
When you do not,
you live just by the day you live,

1678
01:55:19.571 --> 01:55:22.960
not just by the day,
but by the minute.

1679
01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:31.800
You don't want someone who will live out the rest of her days as a mere shell of

1680
01:55:31.961 --> 01:55:36.220
her former self.
I had considered running away,

1681
01:55:37.210 --> 01:55:41.470
but I will never be able to escape from myself and my thoughts.

1682
01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:47.650
I am doing this because I am too weak to withstand the years of pain and agony

1683
01:55:47.651 --> 01:55:52.140
ahead.
Each breath is becoming difficult for me to take.

1684
01:55:53.630 --> 01:55:57.410
The anxiety can be compared to drowning in an open sea.

1685
01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:04.350
I know that my actions will transfer some of this pain to others.
Indeed,

1686
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:06.180
those who love me the most,

1687
01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.400
please forgive me.

1688
01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:17.400
Forgive me because I can not forgive myself.

1689
01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:23.610
<v 1>Love
Iris.</v>

1690
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:41.830
<v 2>When irises mom closes out the book saying it was an untimely death.</v>

1691
01:56:45.070 --> 01:56:45.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:46.810
<v 2>Over the years.</v>

1693
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:51.990
Iris had always commented that life was too short for her to finish the thing

1694
01:56:52.031 --> 01:56:53.560
she wanted to accomplish.

1695
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:59.190
She said many times that she wanted to write more books to make films and record

1696
01:56:59.191 --> 01:57:00.600
more oral histories.

1697
01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:07.260
It was so painful to realize that many of her dreams were not fulfilled,

1698
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:13.970
yet.
It is not how she died,
but rather how she lived.

1699
01:57:13.971 --> 01:57:18.500
That will be her legacy.
Whenever I think of Iris,

1700
01:57:18.710 --> 01:57:23.300
the memories of a loving daughter and a beautiful soul will always remain with

1701
01:57:23.301 --> 01:57:27.870
me.
In her short 36 years,

1702
01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:32.910
she had inspired many,
many people in the world with her noble spirit,

1703
01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:36.930
her passion,
dedication,
sincerity,
and determination

1704
01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:43.440
in preserving historical truth and pursuing justice for the voiceless victims.

1705
01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:50.210
Iris was a woman whose heartbeat passionately for those who suffered.

1706
01:57:51.650 --> 01:57:54.350
She was a woman who could not forget,

1707
01:57:56.610 --> 01:58:00.990
she could not forget their agony and she refused to let their stories go.

1708
01:58:00.991 --> 01:58:05.910
Untold,
iris is life.

1709
01:58:06.090 --> 01:58:08.190
We're short but brilliant

1710
01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:13.050
like a splendid rainbow across the sky.

1711
01:58:13.170 --> 01:58:16.380
One that the goddess she was named after would be proud of

1712
01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:23.040
iris is rainbow was magnificent,

1713
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:26.070
vanishing quickly.

1714
01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:36.233
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1715
01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:44.770
cool.

1716
01:58:44.770 --> 01:58:47.560
<v 0>A rainbow vanishing quickly.</v>

1717
01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:58.350
And I guess that that is what we all are

1718
01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:04.450
purine bow vanishing quickly.

1719
01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:15.200
But before we vanish,

1720
01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:23.120
I say
shine,

1721
01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:33.210
shine,
all that darkness in the world.

1722
01:59:35.730 --> 01:59:39.000
Be the light,
be the color,

1723
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:44.270
be the good and the strong and the brightness that drives away the dark.

1724
01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:52.770
We have.
But one chance here,

1725
01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:56.870
one chance,

1726
01:59:56.871 --> 02:00:01.871
one opportunity to stretch across the sky and shine

1727
02:00:11.630 --> 02:00:12.463
<v 1>value that</v>

1728
02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:19.640
<v 0>value,
that value life</v>

1729
02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:25.850
[inaudible] know
that the light will spread

1730
02:00:28.730 --> 02:00:31.850
and good will prevail.

1731
02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.350
It will prevail over evil.
So long

1732
02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:40.210
as we stand up,

1733
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:44.250
stand up

1734
02:00:46.170 --> 02:00:48.960
against all that wickedness in the world,

1735
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:53.110
we stand up,

1736
02:00:54.670 --> 02:00:59.630
<v 1>okay.
Gunshot.</v>

1737
02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:10.800
<v 0>And I think that's all I've got for tonight.</v>

1738
02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:14.093
Echo,

1739
02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:18.930
why don't you go ahead and take the mic for a minute there

1740
02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:24.210
for while I decompress over on this side.
Sure.

1741
02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:30.480
I was,
uh,
let's talk,
talking with Greg Train yesterday

1742
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:37.070
and you can complain about something where you can embrace,

1743
02:01:37.650 --> 02:01:40.040
this is one of the big things that kind of learned you.
And this

1744
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.090
<v 4>is like when you look at your own situation compared to other past situations</v>

1745
02:01:44.091 --> 02:01:47.450
that are way worse,
right?
So one you start with,
okay,
your,

1746
02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:50.600
your situation isn't that bad.
That's what you start with.

1747
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:55.400
Then you go on to,
okay my situation,
these are small,

1748
02:01:55.401 --> 02:02:00.401
teeny tiny talent challenges that all you have to do is approach them in this

1749
02:02:01.161 --> 02:02:06.030
way of like embracing it.
You know how like,
um,
like anytime,
okay,

1750
02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:08.960
anytime you're feeling frustrated about your situation or whatever.
Right.

1751
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:11.480
And it really impersonal when you put it in perspective,

1752
02:02:11.481 --> 02:02:13.790
these are small challenges that you just got to overcome.

1753
02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:16.640
You take it on as it's like,

1754
02:02:16.641 --> 02:02:20.160
yeah you want to put more work on my plate at work cause I couldn't feel it

1755
02:02:20.210 --> 02:02:23.330
because I can handle it and I'll do it the best and watch me work.
You know?

1756
02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.800
<v 2>That is good.
And an interesting w you know
when,</v>

1757
02:02:29.490 --> 02:02:33.270
when we had Tim Ferriss on here and when I did Tim Ferriss interview the first

1758
02:02:33.271 --> 02:02:35.850
time I was on his podcast and he,

1759
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:38.460
it's the thing that I talked about when he came on here.
Like I,

1760
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:40.710
he asked the question sort of saying,
hey,

1761
02:02:40.711 --> 02:02:43.980
how close to you get to the darkness before it consumes you?

1762
02:02:44.130 --> 02:02:46.350
And I've talked about before,
uh,
you know,

1763
02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:50.730
if you stare into the soul of a monster,

1764
02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.740
you have to be careful because you might become a monster.
And so I,
I mean,

1765
02:02:55.790 --> 02:03:00.030
I,
I think yeah,
there's the drugs that she got put on obviously played a role,

1766
02:03:00.031 --> 02:03:04.740
but she got in this world where all she saw was the bad.

1767
02:03:04.770 --> 02:03:09.090
Yeah.
And I think that to Tim Ferriss,
his point where he was saying to me like,

1768
02:03:09.091 --> 02:03:12.300
hey,
how often should I get close to the darkness?
You know,

1769
02:03:12.301 --> 02:03:16.800
how often should I look at that?
And you know,
my response was,
hey,
you,

1770
02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:20.670
in order to know the light,
you got to know the darkness,

1771
02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:26.130
but you can absolutely go too far in that direction.

1772
02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.460
And you can say to yourself,
wow,

1773
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:32.550
the world is evil and everyone's evil.

1774
02:03:32.551 --> 02:03:35.790
And underneath the surface everyone could turn it into this imperial Japanese

1775
02:03:35.791 --> 02:03:40.110
soldier and commit these atrocities.
And that is what you absolutely.

1776
02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:44.790
And I would say be careful.
I don't know if that's the right word.

1777
02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:48.000
I guess it is the right word.
Be careful.
But to me,
which you have to do is you,

1778
02:03:48.070 --> 02:03:52.740
you have to balance it.
And to me,
as an American,
as a band,

1779
02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:54.810
there's so much good,
right?

1780
02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:59.370
I think that people generally get get jaded to all the good that's out there.

1781
02:03:59.371 --> 02:04:02.160
And that's why I say,
Hey,
you know what?
Look over here at the darkness,

1782
02:04:02.970 --> 02:04:06.690
but for someone that's stuck in a horrible place,

1783
02:04:06.691 --> 02:04:09.510
in a horrible situation in life,
that's those.

1784
02:04:09.511 --> 02:04:12.780
Those folks got to look out and say,
wait a second,
there's not,

1785
02:04:12.810 --> 02:04:16.560
there's so much good out there.
You know,
if you can take it like that's clearly,

1786
02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.080
I mean,
you look at,
look at Iris Chang.
I mean,

1787
02:04:19.081 --> 02:04:24.081
she is smart and successful and beautiful and well liked and had a,

1788
02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:28.110
she came up with an amazing family.
Her parents were adored her,
right?

1789
02:04:28.111 --> 02:04:31.920
She had every thing in her life was good,
right?

1790
02:04:31.921 --> 02:04:34.540
And she lost all that.
She,
you know what it's like,
uh,

1791
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:39.750
if you talk to anybody that flies planes,
if you go into a cloud,

1792
02:04:39.751 --> 02:04:42.270
you lose your orientation.
It happens in diving too.

1793
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:43.770
It happens when you're surfing.
If you,

1794
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:47.700
if you fall off a big wave and you're getting rolled around and sometimes it can

1795
02:04:47.701 --> 02:04:52.350
be hard to tell which way is up,
right?
It can happen.

1796
02:04:52.530 --> 02:04:55.220
You know,
guys drive,
drive their airplanes,
they get lost in the cloud.

1797
02:04:55.230 --> 02:04:57.810
They drive their airplanes into a mountain or they drive it into the ground

1798
02:04:57.811 --> 02:04:58.644
because they don't,

1799
02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:02.790
they get disoriented and they lose sight of which way is up and you or you're

1800
02:05:02.791 --> 02:05:04.770
underwater and you lose sight of which way is up.

1801
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:09.090
That's what you have to watch out for.
You got to be able to say,
wait a second.

1802
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:13.790
If everything is black around me,
okay,
stop.
Yeah,

1803
02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:18.630
let me get oriented.
Let me fix.
Let me check my control panel in the water.

1804
02:05:18.631 --> 02:05:20.820
It's real easy.
You got to look for bubbles.

1805
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:23.490
Which way are the button where the bubbles,
the bubbles are going to go up.

1806
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:26.100
And so when you get trapped in that darkness,

1807
02:05:26.101 --> 02:05:30.330
these people end up in these situations where everything looks black,
stop.

1808
02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:34.860
You're disoriented,
you just can't see.
You don't know the right direction.

1809
02:05:34.890 --> 02:05:37.830
It's okay.
Figure out where the bubbles are.

1810
02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:40.740
They're going to go to the surface and when they get to the surface,

1811
02:05:40.741 --> 02:05:42.330
there's going to be light and you're going to be okay.

1812
02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.220
Obviously Iris,
she got dragged,

1813
02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:51.720
dragged down and disoriented in the darkness and she couldn't figure out that

1814
02:05:51.721 --> 02:05:56.580
she had a husband and a son end up family and money and she had all these

1815
02:05:56.581 --> 02:06:00.000
beautiful things in her life.
Yeah.
Which a lot of them,

1816
02:06:00.001 --> 02:06:03.980
especially if you go full speed in that direction where you don't know which way

1817
02:06:03.981 --> 02:06:08.010
is up,
so you're going down.
Even the good things that come in,
you know,

1818
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:12.840
even,
you know,
getting paranoid,
it's something good and you're like,
that's bad.

1819
02:06:13.130 --> 02:06:14.550
For instance,
for instance,

1820
02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:18.570
she's on a trip and Lou Louisville going to go do a speech or whatever and

1821
02:06:18.571 --> 02:06:21.180
someone's checking her in the hotel.
Maybe someone was saying,
Oh,

1822
02:06:21.181 --> 02:06:23.670
I think that's Iris Chang I saw on TV and said she's thinking,
oh,

1823
02:06:23.671 --> 02:06:27.600
it's some nationalists that are coming to get me.
So yeah,
she was absolutely.

1824
02:06:27.601 --> 02:06:30.650
So that's something that that I think,
and it's something that for,

1825
02:06:30.710 --> 02:06:33.150
for those of us that are not in that situation,

1826
02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:37.230
how do you pay attention and observe people and make sure that your friends or

1827
02:06:37.231 --> 02:06:40.380
people you know or people that are in bad situations,

1828
02:06:40.381 --> 02:06:42.780
how do you make sure that they're getting enough,

1829
02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:46.560
that they know how to orient themselves and get back to the surface and get away

1830
02:06:46.561 --> 02:06:50.190
from all that horribleness when you approach thing.
And I was talking to Greg,

1831
02:06:50.191 --> 02:06:52.710
that's kind of what,
and this just reminded me of it,

1832
02:06:53.010 --> 02:06:54.970
when you approach things like that,
you,

1833
02:06:54.971 --> 02:06:58.170
you know how like you said you're going down,
if you don't know which way is up,

1834
02:06:58.171 --> 02:07:00.930
you're going down a good thing,
you're going to look at it.
That's a bad thing.

1835
02:07:00.931 --> 02:07:03.030
Reinforcing my whole direction by the way.

1836
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:08.390
So if you approach it in a way where things that even would be frustrating to

1837
02:07:08.911 --> 02:07:13.050
like an everyday person,
if you approach it like good,
um,
you know,

1838
02:07:13.230 --> 02:07:14.790
I'm the one to do this thing,

1839
02:07:14.791 --> 02:07:17.440
bring the challenge because the challenges are good.
You know,

1840
02:07:17.441 --> 02:07:22.130
if that's the approach that will reinforce that way of thinking.
Yes,
yes,

1841
02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:25.560
you will be going.
And really,
when you explore darkness,

1842
02:07:27.210 --> 02:07:31.670
that's not to embrace the darkness and be dark.
Like I said,
don't become the de,

1843
02:07:31.690 --> 02:07:35.050
that's basically you're trying to avoid ignorance.
That's what you're doing.

1844
02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:35.990
Because then you got to

1845
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:39.790
<v 4>know dark contrast.
It's a contract.
Okay,
guess what?</v>

1846
02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:43.860
This and for this case,
I mean obviously I,

1847
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:47.590
I pray it never have to read anything as heinous is that again,
ever on the show.

1848
02:07:48.490 --> 02:07:53.140
But
that happened,
right?
That happened.
Yeah,

1849
02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:54.820
that happened.
We should not,

1850
02:07:55.090 --> 02:08:00.090
you shouldn't go through life and not realize that that happened,

1851
02:08:01.050 --> 02:08:05.020
that that happened to you,
that human beings said that to other human beings.

1852
02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:06.820
And as horrible as it is,

1853
02:08:07.330 --> 02:08:11.920
you need to realize that that is a part of our human history.

1854
02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:16.240
So that way you can say,
you can,
you recognize and say,
okay,
this is,

1855
02:08:16.330 --> 02:08:20.980
this can happen and we need to watch out for it.
And Yeah.

1856
02:08:22.930 --> 02:08:27.040
So yeah,
look out for your friends.

1857
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:30.300
Keep them knowing that there's,

1858
02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:32.740
keep them know in which direction they're heading in.

1859
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:37.180
And we see someone going sideways,
bring them,
grab them.

1860
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:41.470
Especially with the,
I mean this is kind of a,
it's specific to this story,

1861
02:08:41.471 --> 02:08:44.550
but the,
uh,
the drugs,
you know,
when you're taking medicate,

1862
02:08:44.590 --> 02:08:47.860
cause that's a pail and men,
it can mess up your pre,

1863
02:08:47.861 --> 02:08:51.690
even like how you said when you get off the drugs,
right.
You know,
cause this,

1864
02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:55.010
these are all chemical things in your brain need for certain things.
For sure.

1865
02:08:55.210 --> 02:08:58.030
So when that part looks sideways,

1866
02:08:58.090 --> 02:09:02.230
you can't like reason necessarily with someone,
you know,

1867
02:09:02.231 --> 02:09:05.170
they can't reason with,
you can't reason with yourself,
you know,

1868
02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:09.610
stuff that would seem obvious.
Hey,
if I,
you know,
walk off this cliff,

1869
02:09:09.670 --> 02:09:11.080
it's obvious that's bad.

1870
02:09:11.081 --> 02:09:14.890
It doesn't really work that way if like your chemicals are off.
Totally.
So yeah,

1871
02:09:14.891 --> 02:09:19.360
you kind of gotta like look out for somebody if you can see that happening.

1872
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:20.890
No doubt.
And it's very,

1873
02:09:20.891 --> 02:09:25.891
it's very interesting that the mind is so incredibly durable,

1874
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:32.620
but at the same time it's just totally fragile.

1875
02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:37.540
Little,
some little change to the,
to the composition or to the,

1876
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:40.940
to the chemicals that are in or to the thought patterns that are in it.
You know,

1877
02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.100
it can be really drastic changes on a,
on a person.

1878
02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:48.180
Oh yeah.
You ever,

1879
02:09:48.181 --> 02:09:51.550
do you ever have a real bad flu and a fever and then you're trying to go to
sleep

1880
02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:59.320
and then yes I have.
And it's almost like a mix between dreaming,

1881
02:09:59.350 --> 02:10:03.700
hallucinating and like,
because man,
it's like your thoughts are all jumbled up.

1882
02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:06.610
Okay.
You want,
you want me to tell you an echo story right now?
Yes.

1883
02:10:06.611 --> 02:10:10.090
This will be a stupid echo stories.
So brace yourself.
Awesome.

1884
02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:13.030
So I was like 20,

1885
02:10:13.031 --> 02:10:18.031
I was 23 years old or something and I was doing the dishes.

1886
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:19.510
Speaking of doing the dishes,

1887
02:10:19.511 --> 02:10:24.511
I was doing the dishes and I turned on the water and I didn't see what was

1888
02:10:24.611 --> 02:10:27.880
happening.
But this little stream,

1889
02:10:27.881 --> 02:10:32.200
a tiny little stream of water had had broken through the pipe at some point in

1890
02:10:32.201 --> 02:10:34.040
the handle and it,
and it

1891
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.560
<v 2>started to land on my hand.
Well,</v>

1892
02:10:36.561 --> 02:10:41.561
I didn't know that it was water cause it must've been the similar temperature to

1893
02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:43.310
what my body was at the time.

1894
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:49.390
And so I see this and it looks for for a quarter of a second,

1895
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:54.290
it looks like my hand is blistering.
It's just,
and it's spreading so rapidly.

1896
02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:57.230
And for a quarter of a second I thought to myself,

1897
02:10:57.290 --> 02:11:00.020
I'm being attacked by chemical warfare and I'm going to die in the next,

1898
02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:03.230
next half a second,
I'm dead.
I think we were,

1899
02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:05.750
we were doing some chemical warfare training or whatever.

1900
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:10.640
And so at that moment for about a half a second,
I thought,
I'm about to die.

1901
02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:13.640
And it only lasted about that then either unless it was water.
And I said,

1902
02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:18.170
but my point is that mentally,
yeah,

1903
02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:22.730
what if you know a different situation,
I could get locked into that mode.

1904
02:11:22.730 --> 02:11:25.370
And when you see iris going,
hey,
these people are coming after me.

1905
02:11:25.670 --> 02:11:28.910
If you get mentally locked in that mode and you start seeing things that are,

1906
02:11:29.170 --> 02:11:29.520
that,

1907
02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:34.520
that you start imposing or overlaying your reality over actual reality,

1908
02:11:34.971 --> 02:11:39.500
you start augmenting reality yourself.
That gets really,
really scary.

1909
02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:41.510
Like,
when you think someone's mad at you,

1910
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:44.060
they would add that you think someone's mad at you.

1911
02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:47.750
So you're looking for all the little cubes,
you know,
gang,

1912
02:11:47.751 --> 02:11:51.710
is this person I met him here or are they not in normal everyday stuff?

1913
02:11:51.770 --> 02:11:52.670
You know why he didn't,

1914
02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:55.970
why didn't she texted me back quickly and it took her five minutes.

1915
02:11:56.210 --> 02:12:00.350
Usually she puts a smiley face,
no smiley face this time.

1916
02:12:01.150 --> 02:12:05.810
Yeah,
she's mad.
I know she's met.
Something's wrong.
But yeah.
So yeah,
if you have,

1917
02:12:05.811 --> 02:12:10.220
meanwhile they're like,
well,
I don't know what time you're talking about.
Anyway,

1918
02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:14.750
speaking of,
uh,
being mad or should I say the opposite of being mad?

1919
02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:18.200
So this is what you do.
Take Alpha,
brain alpha,

1920
02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:21.920
rainy preworkout performance and strength

1921
02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:28.160
and go work out.
See what happens.
That will make a record of that report back.

1922
02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:29.220
Yeah.
Um,

1923
02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:33.380
actually that's something an iris and her mom both referred to a couple of times

1924
02:12:33.381 --> 02:12:36.890
here and they were like,
her mom would say,
you know,
I want to,

1925
02:12:36.891 --> 02:12:38.750
I want you to go exercise with me and I,
you know,

1926
02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.630
I should've put that in the podcast,
but,
but hey,

1927
02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.150
get the book and read it yourself.
I mean,
that's what you need to do.

1928
02:12:44.151 --> 02:12:47.860
I should should've said that earlier.
The raping and King Absolutely.
You know,

1929
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:52.340
get it.
Try and read it when you're in a happy place.
Right?
Yeah.

1930
02:12:52.450 --> 02:12:57.050
It's a hard,
hard read.
It's might be the hardest read of any read possible.

1931
02:12:57.050 --> 02:13:00.890
I don't know what can be harder than that.
And,
and then the book,

1932
02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:03.320
the woman who could not forget by yanging Chang,

1933
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:08.350
which again chronicles her life and it's a really beautiful story and with,

1934
02:13:08.391 --> 02:13:11.840
with obviously with a tragic ending and hopefully lessons learned from it.

1935
02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:17.080
One of the lessons being be physically be physically active and her mom was

1936
02:13:17.271 --> 02:13:20.120
trying to get her to go to the gym with her and work out with her because

1937
02:13:20.121 --> 02:13:24.140
there's no doubt it's,
it's,
it's,
it's physiologically fact,

1938
02:13:24.590 --> 02:13:27.500
physiological fact.
When you work out,
you get endorphins released,

1939
02:13:27.501 --> 02:13:32.060
you feel better.
Yeah,
100% yeah.
And it also,
which is good,

1940
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.950
<v 4>I just heard this or no,
it was Joe Rogan.</v>

1941
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:38.460
He had doctor Rhonda Patrick is her name.

1942
02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:44.900
She was talking about how working at exercise like is it is one of the more

1943
02:13:45.091 --> 02:13:49.800
powerful anti aging.
So you know,
like when you get older,
you know what people,

1944
02:13:49.801 --> 02:13:54.440
you know Alzheimer's,
she said not true physical aging,
but for mental agents.

1945
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:59.520
Well that's what,
yeah man,
it's just an all around good deal.

1946
02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:03.570
So one time I think I even mentioned,
no,
I didn't mention this.

1947
02:14:03.571 --> 02:14:08.520
So one time I,
I might've drank maybe the night before,

1948
02:14:08.670 --> 02:14:13.350
this was like maybe a few months ago and I didn't work out for a while.
You know,

1949
02:14:13.351 --> 02:14:17.070
I was like,
man,
you know,
immersed in,
I dunno,
work out either way.
It didn't work.

1950
02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:20.640
It was,
no,
no,
no.
I got sick and then I got hurt.
So,
okay,

1951
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:24.750
so you cured that with the bottle.
Don't do that

1952
02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:30.150
all.
I'm going to make myself feel bad.
No,
you're not actually.
Yeah,
it works.
Yeah.

1953
02:14:30.151 --> 02:14:33.400
I probably competent continued story and tell everyone what not to do.

1954
02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:37.680
The don't do this.
No,
but there's a happy ending.
So at the,
so boom,

1955
02:14:37.681 --> 02:14:40.080
I was over the sickness,
but Andrew was good and I worked in,

1956
02:14:40.081 --> 02:14:41.250
I worked up kind of hard to,

1957
02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:45.330
and it was weird because I went in the workout thinking,
okay,

1958
02:14:45.331 --> 02:14:50.160
I'm glad I get to go work out,
but when,
when you're done,
okay,

1959
02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:53.160
I'll admit this.
And I think a lot of people have these thoughts where

1960
02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:58.620
maybe you've done something like maybe your routine for whatever reason is going

1961
02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:03.090
over and over,
like just real repetitive.
And then after a while,
yeah,

1962
02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:06.210
true.
But I'm just saying that sometimes these thoughts of like,

1963
02:15:06.211 --> 02:15:10.020
what is all this even mean?
Like what,
what,
what?
Okay,

1964
02:15:10.021 --> 02:15:11.520
I'm going to get this and this.

1965
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:13.770
And it's like you think too much after a while he,

1966
02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:18.750
and so at the end of life it's like,
okay,
I did all of this.
It just,

1967
02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:22.920
I dunno,
it just didn't really,
I was having some of those thoughts.

1968
02:15:22.921 --> 02:15:26.840
They weren't like super heavier enough,
but they're in there.
They're like,
okay,

1969
02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:31.290
great.
Anyway.
So anyway,
fast forward,
I worked out,
did the workout,

1970
02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:38.160
God after it,
textbook definition of God after it.
That was my workout.

1971
02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:41.100
I was done in an actually not even done.

1972
02:15:41.101 --> 02:15:44.010
I was like in the middle of the workout and I was like,
Dang,

1973
02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:49.280
life has straight up meaning like this is what life is and not necessarily the

1974
02:15:50.131 --> 02:15:54.540
workout,
just seeing everything I'm doing,
you know.
It was that feeling.

1975
02:15:54.810 --> 02:15:55.710
Was that the Alpha brain,

1976
02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:00.600
a mustard in to what you're saying is get Algebra.
I'm saying,

1977
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:03.470
I'm saying go workout.
Right.
I like that point.
You got it.

1978
02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:07.380
I'm not saying you got it,
but I'm saying if you want to,
yeah,

1979
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:12.150
workout workout for sure.
Change your life.
Take on it.
Big Time.
Yeah.

1980
02:16:12.151 --> 02:16:12.990
So the Alpha brain,

1981
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:18.840
that's a neutral pick that helps your memory and whatnot.
So anyway,

1982
02:16:18.930 --> 02:16:22.350
if you're going to work out and you want to take some supplements,

1983
02:16:22.410 --> 02:16:25.560
which I recommend now,
I was never supplement person.

1984
02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:30.160
I tried them but never was really into them.
Or I'd be like,
dude,

1985
02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:34.540
you gotta take this,
take the preworkout

1986
02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:40.470
performance and strength.
That's what it's called.
Check.
Take that one.

1987
02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:44.730
What about shroom tech?
I they pick the shroom tech.
Here's the thing.

1988
02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:47.730
He'd been stalking him.
I'm telling you.
See,
watch out.

1989
02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:51.330
I haven't been taking shroom tech.
Oh really?
I feel like that's like cheating.

1990
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:55.760
Not Cheating and cheating,
but I mean in Jujitsu,
I mean,
hmm.

1991
02:16:56.550 --> 02:16:58.950
I don't feel like it's cheating.
No,
it's not cheating,

1992
02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:03.000
but I said you thought it was cheating.
I feel it'll tell you what,

1993
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:06.240
it don't matter.
I mean,
when it comes down to it,
shroom tech or notion of tech.

1994
02:17:06.241 --> 02:17:10.380
Bring it.
Yeah.

1995
02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:14.700
All right.
Nonetheless,
my original point was,
okay,
working out.

1996
02:17:14.730 --> 02:17:19.510
That's the enhancer.
That's the enhancer.
If you want to enhance
the,

1997
02:17:19.550 --> 02:17:24.110
you keep,
you keep making me think of more stuff.
Okay.
I'll stop talking.
Yeah,

1998
02:17:24.450 --> 02:17:26.820
and then I feel like,
oh,
I should talk about that.
Anyway,

1999
02:17:27.810 --> 02:17:32.040
working out as important part that enhances the life.
Yes.

2000
02:17:33.210 --> 02:17:36.120
Alpha brain needs supplements,
Alpha brain,
shroom tech,

2001
02:17:36.121 --> 02:17:39.690
all these other ones that enhances the workout,
which is the enhancers,

2002
02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:43.920
so enhance the enhancer kind of thing.
Anyway,
you liked these things.

2003
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:48.960
You want 10% off,
you don't want to pay full price or maybe do,
I don't know.

2004
02:17:48.961 --> 02:17:53.961
But if you don't go on at.com/chocolate 10% off support yourself as well in your

2005
02:17:54.601 --> 02:17:58.440
wallet.
I want to talk about Amazon Click through.

2006
02:17:59.790 --> 02:18:04.690
That's a good way to support.
That's good because it's like,
you know,

2007
02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:09.150
small little thing doesn't cost you anything as you always say.
And um,
you know,

2008
02:18:09.210 --> 02:18:13.530
big result,
big support.
Yeah.

2009
02:18:13.531 --> 02:18:15.660
I'm going to make the sodium in the fish tank analogy.

2010
02:18:15.661 --> 02:18:18.930
I'm going to do it brewery.
Yeah.
Cause I wasn't expecting that at all.
Yeah.

2011
02:18:18.931 --> 02:18:22.650
You fill the sodium in water and it blows us small speeds of sodium milk boom

2012
02:18:22.651 --> 02:18:24.060
blows.
That's important that you said that.

2013
02:18:24.061 --> 02:18:27.510
But what would be more important would be is actually say how you do Amazon,

2014
02:18:27.511 --> 02:18:30.360
click through or yeah.
So yeah,
I think you're right about that.

2015
02:18:30.361 --> 02:18:33.930
So what you do is you go to [inaudible] dot com a little banner on the side.

2016
02:18:33.931 --> 02:18:37.980
There's the,
the UK [inaudible] Dot Co.
Dot.
UK as well.

2017
02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:43.140
So Germany,
yes.
Germany and yeah,
I think I'm pretty sure.
Yeah,

2018
02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:46.260
it's right there on the side.
Boom.
The,
the,
the main one,

2019
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:50.080
the top one or the one on top is the u s one,
amazon.com.
Oh,

2020
02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:52.320
click through there before you do your Amazon shopping.

2021
02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:56.940
That's the way to support.
Doesn't cost you anything.
Small action.
Big Reaction.

2022
02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:59.220
Be The sodium,
be the sodium

2023
02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:03.930
Jocko is a store.
It's called chocolate store

2024
02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:09.090
Url Jocko store.com if you want shirts,
discipline equals freedom.

2025
02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:15.800
They're all Jocko approved.
The end official.
Go on there.
Look at them.

2026
02:19:15.801 --> 02:19:17.850
If you like them to get a shirt for your friend.

2027
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:21.140
Not all Jocko proof cause I didn't approve the pink women's tee shirts.
Yeah,

2028
02:19:21.141 --> 02:19:25.160
that's true.
That was not approved.
Right.
That was actually Jocko unapproved.
Yeah.

2029
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:30.020
But we always mute Nian.
Yeah.
Which is kind of part of the game too,
right?
No,

2030
02:19:30.021 --> 02:19:33.200
not really.
Okay.
Well,

2031
02:19:33.201 --> 02:19:36.380
according to the shirts that we got it,
it apparently,

2032
02:19:36.381 --> 02:19:41.140
so that one is technically not Jocko approved,
but it's Jocko unapproved.

2033
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:45.390
So it's,
it's dope nonetheless.
And um,
if you think they're solid,
then yeah.

2034
02:19:45.450 --> 02:19:48.660
Get a shirt man.
Support that way.
It's a good way to support,
yeah.

2035
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:51.050
There's some hoodies on there and some rash guards.
Um,

2036
02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:54.070
I've beginning to see more and more people with the rash guards.
Yeah.

2037
02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:58.640
The rash guards seem to be popular.
Yeah.
At least in victory and my main fitness.

2038
02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:03.800
Yeah.
No,
and online as well.
I see you guys doing it anyway.

2039
02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:04.870
Look at them.
If you like something,

2040
02:20:04.890 --> 02:20:07.760
get something that's a good way to support coming out with a new travel mug.

2041
02:20:09.310 --> 02:20:12.110
New and improved new and improved high quality.

2042
02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:16.460
Higher Quality.
Higher Quality.
Yes.

2043
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:21.890
Technically.
Oh,
hold you to,
if you put something hot in their hope makes it,

2044
02:20:21.891 --> 02:20:25.340
keeps it hot for a long time.
Hours.
I forget.
Eight hours or something like that.

2045
02:20:25.341 --> 02:20:29.600
If cold.
Same thing.
I think cold keeps it long.
Keep it cold longer anyway,

2046
02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:33.890
that'll be on the store in two weeks.
Yeah.

2047
02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:40.220
Also good way to support and this is actually supporting yourself big time.

2048
02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:43.190
It's like a little helper.
It's like when you're benching,

2049
02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:46.560
you ever bench pressed too much anymore?
Okay,

2050
02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:50.300
so in the event of you benching,
this is what it's like.

2051
02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:54.860
If benching is the analogy,
it's like someone spotting you if you need it.

2052
02:20:55.010 --> 02:20:59.810
This is what it is.
Psychological warfare you liked it is right.
You get a spot,

2053
02:20:59.890 --> 02:21:03.740
you don't need it necessarily every day.
All the time.
Maybe you don't,

2054
02:21:03.741 --> 02:21:07.460
maybe don't,
depends on,
you know,
a lot of things,
but if you do need it,

2055
02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:10.670
even if you just want it,
hey,
can you spot me?
I might get the,

2056
02:21:10.671 --> 02:21:13.550
I'll probably get all Aau,
but you're there,
you know,

2057
02:21:13.551 --> 02:21:17.000
just in case that's what this is.
So if you're like,
Hey,
I'm going to,
okay,

2058
02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:19.250
this is what it is.
For those who don't know,
but people do know.

2059
02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:20.510
But if you don't know,

2060
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:25.670
it's an album you can buy from iTunes with tracks on it for different scenarios

2061
02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:29.980
of what weakness.
You'd call it,
moments of weakness,
a weakness,

2062
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:33.950
and you need a little spot,
a little spot and guess was fighting you chocolate.

2063
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:38.600
That's the guy to spot.
Right?
Very dependable,
very reliable,
punctual,

2064
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:42.950
all that stuff will,
to me,
they,
they're like two minutes long.
Give or take.
Yeah.

2065
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.300
There's one about,
you know,
before you're going to go and eat.
Yeah.

2066
02:21:48.410 --> 02:21:50.720
There's one called sugarcoated lies.
Yeah.

2067
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:55.990
I think that one might be a good one to end of that one,

2068
02:21:58.310 --> 02:22:03.020
which is I think one of the more memorable moments,

2069
02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:04.010
lines,
whatever.

2070
02:22:04.100 --> 02:22:09.100
And you say something about mobilize your will cause your will is stronger than

2071
02:22:10.251 --> 02:22:15.230
the will of a donut,
right?
Yeah.
Actual.
And that's that.

2072
02:22:15.250 --> 02:22:18.200
When you hear that,
isn't it pretty sad though?
You think yourself,
okay,

2073
02:22:18.201 --> 02:22:20.870
I'm not gonna eat this doughnut.
Yeah,
I'm just going to hold my willpower.

2074
02:22:20.871 --> 02:22:24.920
But then somehow the the will cause a war is a war of wills,
right?

2075
02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:25.800
That's what a warrant is.

2076
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.160
<v 2>So now if you lose that war against the donut means your will is weaker than a</v>

2077
02:22:29.161 --> 02:22:31.350
donut donut.
That's not going to happen.

2078
02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:35.730
New Warfare Perspective,
you're like,

2079
02:22:35.731 --> 02:22:37.020
here's the doughnut and you're like,

2080
02:22:37.021 --> 02:22:39.450
your will is stronger than the doughnut and then you eat the doughnut.

2081
02:22:39.451 --> 02:22:41.220
You basically said,
I understand that.

2082
02:22:41.221 --> 02:22:44.520
Send them this donuts will is stronger than mine.
Don't want to be that person.

2083
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:48.060
And that's your life,
right?
They're putting into perspective anyway.

2084
02:22:48.061 --> 02:22:51.750
If you need that spot,
psychological warfare from Jocko Willink,

2085
02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:56.670
do a search iTunes and it's also on other things that aren't iTunes,

2086
02:22:57.170 --> 02:23:01.890
Amazon music.
It's on,
it's on.
It's no Google play.
I'm pretty sure.
Yeah.

2087
02:23:01.891 --> 02:23:05.540
Anywhere that where you can get like MP three music.
Yeah,
exactly.

2088
02:23:05.550 --> 02:23:09.040
Call it that anymore.
And B,
is that still a thing?
MP3 music?
Well,

2089
02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:13.560
MP three is just the file.
Right.
So remember that used to be MP three players.

2090
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:15.690
Yeah.
Are there still,
yeah.

2091
02:23:15.691 --> 02:23:20.550
Technically everything that can play mp3s isn't MP three player.
Yeah.

2092
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:23.670
So yeah,
get a check that one out.

2093
02:23:23.671 --> 02:23:26.220
That one's a good and it's a good way to support,
you know,
so that's,

2094
02:23:26.221 --> 02:23:30.240
it's a all around circle of support in that way.
Um,

2095
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:34.650
also if you want to get some Jocko white tea,

2096
02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:39.570
you can get it.
You can get that on Amazon and when you get it,

2097
02:23:39.810 --> 02:23:42.540
I know some people are a little nervous when they try it for the first time.

2098
02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:47.520
Just be careful.
You don't want to,
you know,
be in a situation where you,

2099
02:23:48.730 --> 02:23:52.410
you're going to go a little bit harder than normal.
Right.
To be ready for that.

2100
02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:57.120
When he,
when he bring out the chocolate,
you can get once you've used it before,

2101
02:23:57.180 --> 02:24:00.060
you don't have to worry about it.
There's no precautionary wall once you're,

2102
02:24:00.061 --> 02:24:02.760
once you're using it,
but when you start,

2103
02:24:02.940 --> 02:24:06.260
that'd be careful because you're going to go with that little extra stuff that

2104
02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:08.580
you're going to go on.
Attack mode.
Yeah.

2105
02:24:08.610 --> 02:24:10.710
It's kind of like when you turn on your car in,

2106
02:24:10.711 --> 02:24:14.520
the volume is up a little bit more than you're ready for it.
You're like,
oh,

2107
02:24:14.521 --> 02:24:18.180
but then if you do it again,
you're like,
same thing.
Same thing.

2108
02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:22.800
So watch out for that.
Jocko.
White tea on Amazon.
Also for international orders.

2109
02:24:22.801 --> 02:24:23.634
It's on Ebay.

2110
02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:28.470
The official listing is of the Jocko podcast sold by pro resourcing.

2111
02:24:28.471 --> 02:24:31.230
So if you're international and you want to get it,
you can do that.

2112
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:36.590
And for those of you that in an in America there it says you see that the

2113
02:24:36.721 --> 02:24:40.770
shipping is $100 this is not for you to get it from there.

2114
02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:46.080
It's for you to get on Amazon.
If you're in America,
if you're overseas,

2115
02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:48.730
the shipping won't show $100 it'll show whatever the cost is.

2116
02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:53.100
So I've had a couple people like say,
why is the shipping $100?
It's not,

2117
02:24:53.130 --> 02:24:55.920
it's Amazon prime.
The shipping is no cost.
Don't get it from Ebay.

2118
02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:56.783
You understand what I'm saying?

2119
02:24:56.970 --> 02:24:59.880
You're in the U S if you're in the u s and you made a Jedi getting bit and try

2120
02:24:59.881 --> 02:25:02.550
and get it to shipping will show is $100.
You don't get it from Ebay.

2121
02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:05.400
You're not supposed to.
We don't want to sell to everybody in America.

2122
02:25:05.401 --> 02:25:07.830
We can't handle that.
But we can sell to some people overseas.

2123
02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:12.860
Here's what you do Jocko t.com and that has this information on the too,

2124
02:25:14.501 --> 02:25:17.530
so it doesn't have that particular information,
but it's a,
it's like a,

2125
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:21.060
just a basic website.
Um,
Dang.
We did a,

2126
02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:24.760
I don't know why I didn't mention this before.
It's a basic website.
It's like,
oh,

2127
02:25:24.761 --> 02:25:28.480
you're in the u s order from here,
the international order from here,

2128
02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:32.890
jock go t.com it's on Jocko store too.

2129
02:25:32.891 --> 02:25:37.570
But it's like you got to go to the tab and then go to the page.
You know,

2130
02:25:37.790 --> 02:25:42.070
it's,
it's,
it's a thing,
but go to [inaudible] dot com if you,

2131
02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:46.000
if you're just down for the tea bowls needed too.
There you go.
Yeah.
All right,

2132
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.590
well that's all.

2133
02:25:46.590 --> 02:25:50.200
Thank you for informing us of that yet another website for those of you that are

2134
02:25:50.201 --> 02:25:54.550
asking to get after it.
Mugs,
we're looking at march to be honest with you.

2135
02:25:54.740 --> 02:25:58.690
There's so keep looking.
Um,

2136
02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:02.650
also,
you know,
uh,
kids,

2137
02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:04.990
we've got kids out there running around.

2138
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:07.300
We know that we know that kids are impressionable.
Yes.

2139
02:26:07.330 --> 02:26:08.710
Right as they're growing up,
we know that.

2140
02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:11.560
We also know that it's hard to be a kid,
right?

2141
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:16.120
You come up against hard times and if you want to help kids get through some

2142
02:26:16.121 --> 02:26:16.954
hard times,

2143
02:26:18.130 --> 02:26:22.780
you can order this book that I just wrote,
preorder it.

2144
02:26:23.650 --> 02:26:25.720
It's called way of the warrior kid.

2145
02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:29.200
And this is the weird thing about this book.
Um,

2146
02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:33.190
so the other day I was talking to somebody,
it might have even been you.

2147
02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:37.240
I was talking to after I got done with edits,
like the final edits,

2148
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:38.740
I was talking to someone.
Yeah.
You know,

2149
02:26:38.741 --> 02:26:42.040
I just finished the final edits and I said,
and it's awesome.

2150
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:48.750
And then I felt kind of weird because it's not exactly the most humble way to

2151
02:26:48.821 --> 02:26:53.080
describe your work,
right?
Nope.
So I felt that like as soon as I said,
I said,

2152
02:26:53.081 --> 02:26:55.510
why am I saying that this book is awesome?
That's not like me.

2153
02:26:55.511 --> 02:26:58.890
I didn't walk around and go extreme ownership to bespoke ever taken them all

2154
02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:02.440
tree motors.
She was awesome.
I don't say,
well listen to my podcast,
it's awesome.

2155
02:27:02.470 --> 02:27:04.950
No,
I don't say that.
I would say,
hey,
you know,
it's,
if you want to listen to it,

2156
02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:06.940
if you might be interested in you,
oh,
extreme ownership is good.
You know,

2157
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:11.470
he might get some value out of it.
I'm out running around saying I'm awesome.

2158
02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:15.880
Yeah.
For some reason I said,
oh,
this book,
God,

2159
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:19.000
I just got done reading it,
editing it.
It's awesome.
Right.

2160
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:24.030
So I kind of wondered why I said that and then I realized that while I'm

2161
02:27:24.761 --> 02:27:27.030
reading.
Okay.
So when I wrote it right,

2162
02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:30.640
I wrote it like I was in a 10 year old kid,

2163
02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:34.430
but that wasn't me as the guy that's in the book mark these the character,
right?

2164
02:27:34.810 --> 02:27:37.720
So when I read it,
it sounds like him.
It doesn't sound like me.

2165
02:27:37.721 --> 02:27:41.290
It sounds like him.
So I read the book and I think it's him that wrote it,

2166
02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:45.130
this kid,
right.
And I think to myself,
someone said,
how's the book?
And I go,
man,

2167
02:27:45.131 --> 02:27:48.670
it's awesome.
So yeah.
Um,

2168
02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:50.620
that's what I realized and,

2169
02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:56.410
but it is the kind of story that sounds good to read.
Mark,

2170
02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:00.910
the kid,
the 10 year old kid,
he's hurting,
right?

2171
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:04.870
He's made fun of,
can't do any pull ups,

2172
02:28:04.871 --> 02:28:07.840
doesn't know his times tables,
doesn't know how to swim.

2173
02:28:09.100 --> 02:28:13.390
And he's getting bullied like Kenny Williamson,
Dune,
Ken,

2174
02:28:13.391 --> 02:28:15.360
you know Kenny Williamson,
we all know the wheel.
Listen,

2175
02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:18.570
I'm going to post a picture can,
I haven't introduced Kenny Williamson.

2176
02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:21.560
You've yet to the public,
but I'm going to get a out to him.

2177
02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:24.650
So he's going through all these trials and tribulations.

2178
02:28:24.651 --> 02:28:28.790
But luckily his uncle Jake happens to be a big tough frogman man.

2179
02:28:28.791 --> 02:28:32.600
He's going to come and stay with them for the summer.
And when,
Oh,
guess what?

2180
02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:35.780
When,
when mark breaks down,

2181
02:28:36.470 --> 02:28:39.480
cause he doesn't tell his mom what's going on because his mom just is kind of

2182
02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:44.670
mom.
She don't,
doesn't quite,
you know what she's going to say?
Oh right.

2183
02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:49.640
You'll learn that stuff.
She can say,
oh honey,
you're a nice boy.

2184
02:28:49.641 --> 02:28:53.000
Don't worry about that big bully.
He won't bother you anymore.
No,
no.

2185
02:28:53.001 --> 02:28:56.150
My mom actually he will.
Right.
So,

2186
02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:00.080
so Martin breaks down kind of,
he won't tell his mom,

2187
02:29:00.081 --> 02:29:03.680
but then uncle comms and his uncle is like,
hey we,
you know,
we didn't hang out.

2188
02:29:03.681 --> 02:29:06.710
What are you gonna do?
What he or she could do anything.
I get swim breaks down.

2189
02:29:07.660 --> 02:29:12.470
So you know what uncle Jake says when mark gets done listing all of his

2190
02:29:12.471 --> 02:29:16.070
problems,
lay down,
he says,
good.

2191
02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:20.960
All those problems you got,
we can,
we can take care of those problems.

2192
02:29:20.990 --> 02:29:24.350
Those are all solvable.
All we gotta do is we've got to work.
We got to study,

2193
02:29:24.351 --> 02:29:27.260
we got to train and that's what they do.
So

2194
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:32.000
like I said,
I won't say it's awesome,

2195
02:29:32.810 --> 02:29:37.640
but from the perspective of the good,
when you look at it,
if a kid wrote that,

2196
02:29:37.641 --> 02:29:41.300
you'd say,
that's a pretty good story.
Got there.
And here's the deal.

2197
02:29:41.301 --> 02:29:45.260
A preorder it on Amazon.
Why,
why,
why preorder?

2198
02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:50.150
Let me tell you why they got to print it.
Right.
And they're going to print,

2199
02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:51.410
they're going to go,
oh well,
you know,

2200
02:29:51.411 --> 02:29:54.590
it's the kids walking in kids' books don't sell very well.
So,
um,
you know,

2201
02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:57.760
you just will print out 80 copies or whatever,
you know,

2202
02:29:57.930 --> 02:29:59.660
they'll have their formula and they got their formula.

2203
02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:03.970
The formula is not going to work just like it didn't work for Jaguar,

2204
02:30:04.210 --> 02:30:08.840
knew it was not going to work.
So the earlier that you preorder it,

2205
02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:12.440
the more they'll print the,
then we won't have the shortage,

2206
02:30:12.441 --> 02:30:15.750
the scenario that massive screaming in the streets and give us her book.

2207
02:30:15.751 --> 02:30:19.100
So preorder it and that'll take care of that while you're doing it.

2208
02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:22.670
Pick up raping and King,
Iris Chang.

2209
02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:26.600
These will be on the Jocko podcast store.

2210
02:30:26.601 --> 02:30:28.940
Click through in the book section and not the store,

2211
02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:33.800
[inaudible] dot com Jocko podcast.com books.
And the woman who could not forget,

2212
02:30:34.100 --> 02:30:37.220
grabbed that one.
Of course you can also pick up,

2213
02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:39.860
you can pick up a couple copies of extreme ownership,

2214
02:30:39.890 --> 02:30:44.750
which is the book written by myself and Leif Babin and you know what?

2215
02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:47.000
Get a few copies and I'll tell you why.

2216
02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:50.810
Because you got to give them to your people on the team,
right?

2217
02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:54.650
How many people write to me and say,
I gave this to so and so and they said,

2218
02:30:54.651 --> 02:30:58.280
thank you.
Yeah,
this is great.
Get them all in the game.
You know they need it.

2219
02:30:58.310 --> 02:31:00.230
If you didn't have it,
would you want somebody to give it to you?

2220
02:31:00.231 --> 02:31:02.150
Let me ask you that question.
Yes you would.

2221
02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:03.710
It's going to help you out with your game.

2222
02:31:03.860 --> 02:31:06.750
So you're going to want them to do that.
And by the way,
if your car,

2223
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:09.890
if you're at your company,
your business and you need some,

2224
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:13.820
some leadership alignment,
you got some little situations going on,

2225
02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:17.150
you can check out Leif Babin and we also,
we order a book.

2226
02:31:17.151 --> 02:31:19.980
We also have a company called echelon front.
You can that out.
That's what we do.

2227
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.120
<v 0>Leadership and management consulting and that's what we do.</v>

2228
02:31:24.121 --> 02:31:29.121
We get companies leadership aligned and on the same page and give them the tools

2229
02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:34.590
to lead and win.
Enough said on that.
Also with extreme ownership,

2230
02:31:34.591 --> 02:31:39.270
we've got the muster coming muster number two,
May 4th and fifth,

2231
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:43.000
Marriott,
marquis,
New York City,
boom.
Yeah.

2232
02:31:44.130 --> 02:31:48.420
Now you know when people talk about the,
people say,
oh,
it's a game changer,

2233
02:31:49.170 --> 02:31:50.190
right?
People say that.

2234
02:31:51.270 --> 02:31:54.730
I think and and you usually go really changed the team.

2235
02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:59.910
They got a new flavor of tortilla chips at the restaurant.
It's a game changer.

2236
02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:03.060
No,
that's not a game changer.
It's not description.

2237
02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:06.800
Kind of the most common description I've heard of muster number one that we did

2238
02:32:06.801 --> 02:32:09.990
in San Diego is game changer.
So

2239
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:16.410
people are getting after it.
Leadership,
management,
health,
Jujitsu,

2240
02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:19.620
the good stuff.
Of course I'm going to be there.

2241
02:32:19.621 --> 02:32:21.810
Of course Leif Babin he's going to be there.

2242
02:32:21.810 --> 02:32:25.110
Obviously Echo Charles going to be there,
JP to Denelle.

2243
02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:28.410
You heard him on the podcast,
you're going to see him there and we,
none of us,

2244
02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:32.940
none of us would be hiding backstage.
There will not be a backstage.

2245
02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:37.740
We're not going to be there.
We will be with you out front talking,

2246
02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:41.520
discussing,
solving problems and crushing things.

2247
02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:46.530
So come and get that May 4th and fifth and until the muster,

2248
02:32:48.330 --> 02:32:52.410
while you're waiting to get to the muster,
you can still kick it with us.

2249
02:32:54.300 --> 02:32:58.170
Absolutely.
Cause we're on the interwebs.
We are on Instagram,

2250
02:32:58.890 --> 02:33:00.270
we're on Twitter as well.

2251
02:33:01.290 --> 02:33:05.550
And if you're gonna be looking for now one that Facebook people

2252
02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:09.780
were on that one as well so you can find us there.

2253
02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:14.960
Echo is at echocharles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2254
02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:18.573
And

2255
02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:25.200
finally thanks to everyone for what you do in the military and the police and

2256
02:33:27.581 --> 02:33:28.540
the fire department.

2257
02:33:28.810 --> 02:33:33.810
Thanks to you all for keeping us safe and in the workforce,

2258
02:33:35.650 --> 02:33:40.650
the troopers around the world creating and building what we have,

2259
02:33:44.170 --> 02:33:48.640
making the world a better place.
Thank you for what you do.

2260
02:33:48.730 --> 02:33:53.560
Grinding and pushing and making things happen.

2261
02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:00.190
And again,
I know

2262
02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:06.670
that this podcast was hard to listen to.

2263
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:09.670
I know that this episode was

2264
02:34:12.690 --> 02:34:13.830
disturbing

2265
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:19.930
and it was hard for me to read.

2266
02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.020
But again,
to me it is a reminder.

2267
02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:32.640
It's a reminder to all of us that darkness is real.

2268
02:34:32.970 --> 02:34:34.350
And as I said,

2269
02:34:34.351 --> 02:34:39.351
we cannot get lost in that darkness and we can't let the people we know get lost

2270
02:34:40.141 --> 02:34:44.880
in that darkness.
And it's a reminder that we have to eliminate

2271
02:34:47.070 --> 02:34:51.250
that darkness
and we cannot,

2272
02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:56.400
we cannot let evil thrive and permanate permeate.

2273
02:35:00.130 --> 02:35:03.370
We can't let it permeate on a mass scale

2274
02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:05.890
like Nan king

2275
02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:11.030
or on a personal level

2276
02:35:13.530 --> 02:35:16.620
like the beautiful Iris Chang.

2277
02:35:20.490 --> 02:35:23.130
So get out there,

2278
02:35:26.130 --> 02:35:30.090
get out there,
live your life,

2279
02:35:32.310 --> 02:35:36.150
get after it,
get after it every day.

2280
02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:38.850
Go out there into the world

2281
02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:43.673
and shine.

2282
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:49.570
So until next time,

2283
02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:53.170
this is echo and Jocko

2284
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:55.520
<v 1>out.</v>
