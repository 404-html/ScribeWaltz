This is Jocko podcast number 83 with Echo Charles and me,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.660
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.380
on the 19th of February,

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.380
1945 after three days of heavy pre landing bombardment,

5
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.510
which attempted to destroy the heavy fortifications that the Japanese had built

6
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.590
on that day.
The 19th of February,

7
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.350
1945 in American amphibious forces,

8
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.410
primarily US marines of the third or fourth and fifth marine divisions along

9
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:51.911
with soldiers from the US army's 140 seventh infantry regiment landed on the

10
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:55.540
island of [inaudible].

11
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.330
By the end of the first day,

12
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.890
some battalions had a casualty rate of over 80%

13
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.930
<v 1>yeah.</v>

14
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.930
<v 0>On the morning of 20 February,</v>

15
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.080
1945 Marine Corps First Lieutenant Isaacs was taking cover and a foxhole about

16
00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:22.570
300 yards from the beach.

17
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.560
When he was hit by a Japanese mortar strike,

18
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.160
he was severely wounded in his left arm and in his head

19
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.350
he was evacuated to a hospital ship off shore,

20
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.150
which is where he died the next day on February 21st,

21
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.053
1945

22
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.700
and it was about two months prior to that on December 17th,

23
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.470
1945 that First Lieutenant Leonard Smith Isaacs had written a letter.

24
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.130
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

25
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.050
<v 0>to his two boys.
Now</v>

26
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.950
I have a lot of people ask me questions about parenting.
I got four kids,

27
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:19.360
so,
so people want to know my thoughts on it be.

28
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.260
We'll also obviously ask me about war and they asked me what kind of advice I

29
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:25.580
have for my son.

30
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.530
And I think that First Lieutenant Isaac's answers many

31
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.760
of these questions a lot better than I ever could.

32
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.623
<v 1>No.</v>

33
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.840
<v 0>And here's what he told them in that letter.</v>

34
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.880
<v 0>December 17th,</v>

36
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.610
1944 my dear little boys,
I'm writing you today,

37
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.060
just a week before Christmas Eve in in the that you will get this little note at

38
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:02.914
Christmas time.

39
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.740
<v 0>All of this coming week.</v>

41
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.910
We'll be holidays and I can just imagine the fun you'll be having,

42
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.410
especially when you know it's just a few days before Santa Claus will be coming.

43
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.570
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.680
<v 0>If it were possible,</v>

45
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.340
I would like to come down the chimney myself and crawl right into your stocking.

46
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.510
Wouldn't that be a surprise?

47
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

48
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.820
<v 0>I would enjoy it even more than you.</v>

49
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.720
<v 0>But since your dad is far away and Santa Claus has the only rain deers that</v>

51
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.650
we'll fly through here,
I'm afraid we'll have to let Santa Claus used them

52
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.720
after all.
He has so many places to go in such a short time.

53
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.680
I won't be able to give you a Christmas present personally this year,

54
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.740
but I do want you to know that I think of you all the time and feel very proud

55
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.840
of the way you have been helping your mother while I'm gone.

56
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.090
I know that it's only natural for young,

57
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:06.740
healthy and strong boys like you are to want to play and have fun all the time,

58
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.420
but I do want you to think about helping mummy because it is hard for her to do

59
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:15.140
everything while I'm gone.

60
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.300
I know that you would like to give me a Christmas present too,

61
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.130
so I will tell you what you can do and this will be your Christmas present to me

62
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.023
every day.

63
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.880
Ask Mommy if there are errands that you can do for her and when there are

64
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:36.770
errands to run,
say sure mommy,
and then give her a big smile.
Then during the day,

65
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.000
go up to your room and look around.
If there are toys scattered all around,

66
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:43.820
are you left some of your clothes on the floor?
Pick them up.

67
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.270
Also,
when Mommy is busy trying to clean up the house,

68
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.500
don't leave her by herself,
but ask mummy if you can help her.

69
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.030
Take care of baby sister.

70
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.800
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.480
<v 0>If you do those things for me,</v>

72
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.570
that will be the finest Christmas present that you could give me.

73
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.220
Oh yes and CC.
Are you eating your meals like a real man now?

74
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.440
Well,
my boys,

75
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.630
I guess you often wonder why people fight and have wars and why lots of daddy's

76
00:05:17.631 --> 00:05:21.260
have to be oh way.
This Christmas time at fighting

77
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.040
when it would be much nicer to be at home.

78
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.293
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.970
<v 0>that's a hard question to answer,</v>

80
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.800
but you see some countries like Japan and Germany have people living in them

81
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.930
just like people.
You and I know.

82
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.310
<v 0>Those people want to tell everybody what they can do and what they can't do.</v>

84
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.530
<v 0>No one likes to be told how to live their life.</v>

86
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.550
I know that you wouldn't like it if one of the boys in the neighborhood tried to

87
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:55.660
tell you what church you should go to,
what school you should go to,

88
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.740
and particularly if that boy would always be trying to beat up some smaller or

89
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.710
weaker boy,
you wouldn't like it.
What'd you,

90
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.050
and unfortunately,

91
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.240
the only way to make a person like that stop these sort of things or a country

92
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.010
like Japan or Germany,

93
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.600
he has to fight them and beat them and teach them that being a bully because

94
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.720
after all,
that's what they are,

95
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.710
is not the way to live and that we won't put up with it.

96
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.270
What does all this mean to you?
Just simply this,

97
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:33.230
my boys' Dad doesn't ever want you to be a bully.

98
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.460
I want you to always fight against anyone who tries to be one.

99
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.800
I want you to always help the smaller fellow or the little boy who may not be as

100
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:43.634
strong as you.

101
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.560
I want you to always share what you have with the other fellow and above all my

102
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.270
boys have courage.

103
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.350
Have courage to do the things that you think are right.

104
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.230
Never be afraid to fight for what you think is right

105
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.900
to do those things.
You need a strong body and a brave heart.

106
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.600
Never run away from someone you may be afraid of.
If you do,

107
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.400
you will feel ashamed of yourself and before long you will find it so easy to

108
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:18.550
run away from the things that you should stand up and fight against.

109
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.570
If you had lots of other boys,

110
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:26.450
try to do the things that dad has been talking about in this letter,

111
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.250
they may be that people will not have to fight wars in the years to come.

112
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.400
<v 1>Okay?</v>

113
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.400
<v 0>And then all the daddies in this world will be home for Christmas</v>

114
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.670
and that is where they belong.

115
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.270
Perhaps some of the things that I've been talking about you don't quite

116
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.240
understand.
If you don't,

117
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.820
mummy will explain them to you.
She knows

118
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.250
merry Christmas and a happy new year.

119
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.370
God bless you
Daddy,

120
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.030
and obviously

121
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.290
many brave American stood and fought for what they believed in on that

122
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.200
tiny island of Iwo Jima.

123
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.830
<v 0>Then they suffered massive losses to gain that victory</v>

125
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.290
over the course of that five week battle,

126
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.280
19,217 were wounded.

127
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.750
Six 821

128
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.583
<v 1>were killed.</v>

129
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.263
Okay,

130
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.300
<v 0>and First Lieutenant Leonard Smith,</v>

131
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.130
Isaacs Marine.

132
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.270
How's it been?
Father

133
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.453
Daddy.

134
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

135
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.980
<v 0>Was buried at sea.</v>

136
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.600
<v 0>34 years old.</v>

138
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.010
Reading that

139
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.370
letter made me think about another letter I had read from another parent

140
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.010
and it's another letter that I find to be

141
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.670
just an incredible guide to not only to parenting,
but to living

142
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.080
on.
This one was written not by a father,

143
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.490
but by a mother and it's not a letter to his son,
but to a daughter.

144
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.700
Then the daughter's name was Janna.

145
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.520
Then the mother's name was Dr Miao,
Alda Horror Kova,

146
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.640
and she wrote the letter from prison

147
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:43.230
while she was on trial for treason and for conspiracy on trial by the Soviet

148
00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:49.780
backed communist government of Czechoslovakia.

149
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:55.130
After they had taken control of the country in a coup,

150
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.820
and she and her fellow so called conspirators were jailed and tortured and then

151
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:10.490
put through a grandiose show trial

152
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:15.963
and she knew,

153
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.920
she knew that she was going to be made an example of

154
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.130
she knew
she was facing death

155
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.340
planned the night before her execution.

156
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.560
She wrote a letter to her daughter

157
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.440
who was 16 at the time,
and this is some of what wrote

158
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.460
my only little girl,
Janna.

159
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.783
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.030
<v 0>God blessed my life as a woman with you</v>

161
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.370
as your father wrote in the poem from German prison,

162
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.200
God gave you to us because he loved us.

163
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

164
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.030
<v 0>Apart from your father's magic,
amazing love.</v>

165
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.710
You were the greatest gift I received from fate.

166
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

167
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.303
<v 0>However,</v>

168
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.480
providence plan my life in such a way that I could not give you nearly all that

169
00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:35.820
my mind and heart had prepared for you.

170
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.060
The reason was not that I loved you little.

171
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.980
I love you just as purely and fervently as all their mothers love their
children.

172
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.140
But I understood that my task here in the world,

173
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.630
what's to do you good by seeing to it that life becomes better

174
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.470
and that all children can live well

175
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.360
and therefore we often had to be apart for a long time.

176
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.820
It is now already for the second time that fate has torn us apart.

177
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.420
Don't be frightened and sad because I am not coming back anymore.

178
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.340
Learn my child to look at life early as a serious matter

179
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.060
life is hard,

180
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.360
<v 1>okay?</v>

181
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.050
<v 0>It does not pamper anybody and for every time it's strokes you,</v>

182
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.730
it gives you 10 blows.

183
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.190
<v 1>Okay?</v>

184
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.410
<v 0>Become accustomed to that soon,</v>

185
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.350
but don't let it defeat you.
Decide to fight.

186
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:56.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

187
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.260
<v 0>Have courage and clear goals and you will win over life.</v>

188
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.960
March is still unclear to your young mind and I don't have time left to explain

189
00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:11.380
to you things I w you would still like to ask me.

190
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.400
<v 1>Okay?</v>

191
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.000
<v 0>One day when you grow up,
you will wonder and wonder why your mother,</v>

192
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:22.030
who loved you and whose greatest gift you were managed her life so strangely.

193
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.070
Perhaps then you will find the right solution to this problem.

194
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.570
Perhaps a better one than I could give you today myself.

195
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.073
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

196
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.223
<v 0>of course.</v>

197
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:41.090
You will not only be able to solve the correctly and truthfully by knowing very,

198
00:14:41.091 --> 00:14:44.870
very much,
not only from books but from people.

199
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.070
Learn from everybody.
No matter how unimportant.

200
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.360
Go through the world with open eyes and listen not only to your own pains and

201
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:03.980
interests,
but also to the pains,
interests,

202
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.080
and longings of others.

203
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.920
Don't ever think of anything as none of your business.
No.

204
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.270
Everything must interest you.
Then use your reflect about everything.

205
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.270
Compare and compose individual phenomenon.

206
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.630
Man Doesn't live in the world alone

207
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.533
<v 2>in that</v>

208
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.250
<v 0>there is great happiness,
but also a tremendous responsibility.</v>

209
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.060
That obligation is first of all and not being an acting exclusive,

210
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.630
but rather merging with the needs and the goals of others.

211
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:44.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

212
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.670
<v 0>This does not mean to be lost in the multitude,</v>

213
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:53.690
but it is to know that I am part of all and to bring one's best into that

214
00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:57.480
community.
If you do that,

215
00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.160
you will succeed in contributing to the common goals of human society.

216
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.440
Be More aware of one principal than I have been.

217
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.690
Approach everything in life constructively.
Be Aware,

218
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.670
be aware of unnecessary negation.

219
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.400
I'm not saying all negation because I believe that one should resist evil,

220
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.830
but in order to be a truly positive person in all circumstances,

221
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.570
one has to learn how to distinguish real gold from tinsel.

222
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.700
It is hard because tensile sometimes glitters,
so dazzlingly

223
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.340
I can fess my child that often in my life I was dazzled by glitter

224
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.440
and sometimes it even shown so falsely that one dropped pure gold from one's

225
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:55.070
hand and reached for ran after false gold.

226
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:03.330
You know that to organize one scales of values means to know not only one self

227
00:17:06.101 --> 00:17:06.730
well,

228
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.260
but to be in from an in the analysis of one's character,

229
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:17.550
but also to know others to know as much as possible of the world it's past,

230
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.020
it's present

231
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.023
<v 2>and future.</v>

232
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.180
<v 0>In short,
to understand</v>

233
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.060
not to close one's ears before anything and for no reason,

234
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.620
not even to shut out the faults and opinions of anybody who stepped on my toes

235
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.540
or even wounded me deeply.

236
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.640
<v 2>Examine,
think,</v>

237
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.070
<v 0>criticize.
Yes,</v>

238
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.350
mainly criticize yourself.

239
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.140
Don't be ashamed to admit a truth you have come to realize,

240
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.620
even though you proclaim the opposite a little while ago,

241
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.393
<v 1>okay?</v>

242
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.830
<v 0>Don't become obstinate about your opinions,</v>

243
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.460
but when you come to consider something right than be so definite that you can

244
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:18.950
fight and die for it.

245
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.490
That's Walker said,
death is not bad.

246
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.770
Just avoid gradual dying,

247
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:33.150
which is what happens when one suddenly finds oneself apart from the real life

248
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.253
of others.

249
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.610
You have to put down your roots where fate has determined you for you to live,

250
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.360
you have to find your own way.
Look for it independently.

251
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.370
Don't let anything turn you away from it,

252
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.650
not even the memory of your mother and father,

253
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:50.910
<v 1>okay?</v>

254
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.660
<v 0>If you really love them,
you won't hurt them by seeing them critically,</v>

255
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:56.650
<v 1>okay?</v>

256
00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.740
<v 0>Just don't go on a road which is wrong,
dishonest,</v>

257
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.900
and does not harmonize with wife.

258
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.700
I have changed my mind many times,
rearranged many values,

259
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
but what was left in as an as an essential value without which I cannot imagine

260
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.420
my life is the freedom of my conscience.

261
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.050
I would like you,
my little girl to think about whether I was right.

262
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.370
<v 1>Okay,</v>

263
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.680
<v 0>another value is worth.</v>

264
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.613
<v 1>Okay?</v>

265
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.660
<v 0>I don't know which to assign the first place in which the second learn to love</v>

266
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.440
work any work,

267
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.710
but one you have to really to know really and thoroughly then don't be afraid of

268
00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:52.430
anything and things will turn out well for you.

269
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.550
And don't forget about love in your life.

270
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.000
I'm not only thinking of the red blossom,

271
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:04.080
which one day will bloom in your heart and you.
If fate favors,

272
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:08.730
you will find a similar one in the heart of another person with WHO's road

273
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:10.020
yours.
We'll merge.

274
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.520
I'm thinking of love without which one cannot live happily.

275
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.920
I don't ever crumble.
Love,
learn to give it whole and really

276
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:29.470
and learn to love precisely those who encouraged love so little,

277
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.190
my little girl Janna,

278
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.480
when you will be choosing for whom your maiden heart shall burn and to whom to

279
00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:44.240
really give yourself remember your father.

280
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

281
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.190
<v 0>I know if you will meet</v>

282
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.300
<v 1>with such luck as I,</v>

283
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.810
I don't know if you will meet such a beautiful human being or choose your ideal

284
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.010
close to him.

285
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:04.190
<v 0>Perhaps you my little one have already begun to understand and now perhaps you</v>

286
00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:09.030
understand to the point of pain what we have lost in him.

287
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:10.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

288
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.700
<v 0>What I find hardest to bear is that I am also guilty of that loss.</v>

289
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.450
I've heard from my legal representative that you are doing well in school and

290
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:23.560
that you want to continue.

291
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.710
I was very pleased but even if you would one day have to leave school and work

292
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:34.000
for your livelihood,
don't stop learning and studying.

293
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

294
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.020
<v 0>If you really want to,
you will reach your goal.</v>

295
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.510
<v 0>I would have liked for you to become a medical doctor.
You remember that?</v>

297
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:44.410
We talked about it.

298
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.200
Of course you will decide yourself and circumstances will too,

299
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.620
but if you stand one day in the traditional alma mater and carry home from

300
00:21:58.411 --> 00:22:01.320
graduation,
not only your doctor's diploma,

301
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.980
but also the real ability to bring people relief as a doctor,

302
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.260
then my little girl,
your mother will be immensely pleased.

303
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.070
<v 1>Okay?</v>

304
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:18.070
<v 0>But your mother would only be truly happy no matter where you stand,</v>

305
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.020
whether at the operating table,
at the lave,

306
00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.370
at your child's cradle,
or at the work table in your household.

307
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.640
If you will do your work skillfully,
honestly,
happily,

308
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.440
and with your whole being,

309
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.480
then you will be successful in it.

310
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.430
Don't be demanding in life,

311
00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.820
but have high goals.

312
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.080
They're not exclusive of each other

313
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:59.710
for what I call demanding are those selfish notions and needs.

314
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.720
Restrict them from yourself.

315
00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.140
Realize that in view of the disaster and sorrow which happened to you,

316
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.030
Vira epic,

317
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.650
grandmother and grandfather and many others will try to give you what they have

318
00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.240
and what they cannot afford.

319
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.470
You should not only not ask for it.

320
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.990
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

321
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.220
<v 0>but learn to be modest.
If you become used to it,</v>

322
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.490
you will not be unhappy because of material things you don't have.

323
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:33.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

324
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.660
<v 0>You don't know how free one feels.
If one trains oneself and modesty,</v>

325
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.730
how he or she gets a headstart over against the

326
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.340
and by how much one is safer and stronger.

327
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.140
I really tried this out on myself and if you can thus double your strength,

328
00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.320
you can set yourself courageous,
high goals,

329
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.580
read much and study languages.

330
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:10.290
You will thereby broadened your life and multiply its content.

331
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.240
There was a time in my life when I read voraciously and then again times when

332
00:24:17.251 --> 00:24:21.360
work did not permit me to take a single book in my hand apart from professional

333
00:24:21.361 --> 00:24:24.800
literature.
That was a shame.

334
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.600
Here in recent months I've been reading a lot,

335
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.840
even books which probably would not interest me outside,

336
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.430
but it is a big important task to read.

337
00:24:35.431 --> 00:24:39.120
Everything valuable or at least much.
That is

338
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.820
I shall write down for you at the end of this letter what I've read in recent

339
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.260
months.
I'm sure you will think of me when you will be reading it

340
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.510
and now also something for your body.

341
00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.320
I am glad that you are engaged in sports.
Just do it systematically.

342
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.750
I think that there should be rhythmic exercises and if you have time,

343
00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:10.500
also some good systematic gymnastics

344
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.960
and those quarter hours every morning.

345
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:20.390
Believe me finally that it would save you a lot of annoyance about unfavorable

346
00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:23.150
proportions of your waist if you could really do it

347
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.140
is also good for the training of your will and perseverance.

348
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.500
Your photograph showed me your new hairdo.

349
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.380
They looks good,

350
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.940
but it isn't it isn't it a shame to hide your nice forehead and that lady and

351
00:25:44.941 --> 00:25:48.340
the ball gown really.
You look lovely,
but your mother's,

352
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.710
I noticed one fault which may be due to the way you were placed on the

353
00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:56.730
photograph.
Wasn't the neck opening a little deep for your 16 years.

354
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.380
Don't primp.
But whenever possible,

355
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.230
dress carefully and neatly.

356
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:15.570
Janna,
please take good care of grandfather and grandmother.

357
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.880
They're old hearts now.
Need the most constellation.

358
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.583
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.670
<v 0>Visit them often and let them tell you about your father's and mother's youth so</v>

360
00:26:27.671 --> 00:26:30.670
that you can preserve it in your mind for your children.

361
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:38.220
In that way an individual becomes a mortal and we shall continue in you and the

362
00:26:40.981 --> 00:26:42.240
others of your blood

363
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.970
and one more thing.
Music.

364
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.670
I believe you will show your gratitude to grandfather for the piano which he

365
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:55.650
gave you by practicing honestly,

366
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:00.510
and that you will succeed in what peptic wants so much and accompanying him when

367
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:02.730
he plays the violin or the viola.

368
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.980
Please do them that favor.

369
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.430
I know that it would mean a lot to him and it would be beautiful

370
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.460
and when you can play well together,
play me the urea from Martha,

371
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.171
my rose,

372
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:24.171
you bloom alone there on the hillside and then sleep my little prince by Mozart

373
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.780
and then your father's favorite under your window by Chopin.

374
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:35.960
You'll play it for me,
won't you?

375
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.270
I shall always be listening to you.

376
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.910
Just one more thing.
Choose your friends carefully.

377
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.700
Among other things,

378
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.850
one is also very much determined by the people with whom one associates or

379
00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.420
associates.
Therefore choose very carefully,

380
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.760
be careful in everything and listen to the opinions of others about your

381
00:28:05.761 --> 00:28:07.620
girlfriends.
Without being told,

382
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.180
I shall never forget your charming letter today.

383
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:17.181
I can tell you which you once in the evening pinned to my pillow to apologize

384
00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:20.790
when I caught you for the first time at the gate in the company of a girl and a

385
00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:21.624
boy.

386
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:27.230
You explained to me at that time why it is necessary to have a gang,

387
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.260
have your gang little girl,
but of good and clean young people

388
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.400
and compete with each other in everything.
Good.

389
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.260
Only please don't confuse young people.

390
00:28:42.261 --> 00:28:45.260
Springtime infatuation with real love.

391
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.670
Do you understand me?

392
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:53.690
If you don't on Vera will help you explain what I meant

393
00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.530
and so my only young daughter,

394
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.750
little girl,
Janna,
new life,

395
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.410
my hope,
my future forgiveness,

396
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.083
live

397
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.610
grasp life with both hands.

398
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.950
Until my last breath,
I shall pray for your happiness,

399
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.540
my dear child,

400
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.820
kiss your hair,
eyes and mouth.

401
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.960
I stroke you

402
00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.910
<v 1>and hold you in my arms.</v>

403
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.460
<v 0>I shall always be with you.</v>

404
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.510
The next day,
despite

405
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:13.560
international outcry,
Muladhara horror

406
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.640
was executed,

407
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.840
Craig's Penn crack prison.

408
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.640
Then again,
there's just so much to be

409
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.233
learned

410
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.930
from those letters and as parents,

411
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.720
there's so much for us to teach and I think the thing that

412
00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.970
hits me is that these are all things that we know,

413
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.440
<v 1>okay,</v>

414
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.920
<v 0>we know them.
We know to take care of our health.</v>

415
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.510
We know to wake up and exercise.
We know we should choose our friends carefully.

416
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.860
We know we should be or our own worst critics

417
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.320
and we know that if we have been wrong about something,

418
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.090
we should simply admit that

419
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:28.090
and move our minds to what is right and what is correct.

420
00:31:28.671 --> 00:31:32.000
We know we should work hard and help people.

421
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.010
We know the value of freedom

422
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:48.130
and we know that freedom must be fought for
here.

423
00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:53.131
We know that we should be brave and that that is possible only through a strong

424
00:31:53.281 --> 00:31:57.870
body,
mind and heart,
and we know all those things.

425
00:31:57.871 --> 00:31:58.740
We know though.

426
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.653
No,

427
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.293
<v 1>teach them,</v>

428
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.450
<v 0>teach them and live them.</v>

429
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:22.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

430
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.950
<v 0>Set the right example by living them</v>

431
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:29.223
<v 1>because</v>

432
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.720
<v 0>our children
are watching.</v>

433
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.023
<v 2>Okay.</v>

434
00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.850
<v 0>They're watching it.
I know.</v>

435
00:32:42.851 --> 00:32:47.851
Actually I think you have to do more than just set the example.

436
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.090
I think you actually have to

437
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:54.223
<v 2>to tell them.</v>

438
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.040
<v 0>I think you actually have to tell them and you think about the power of these</v>

439
00:32:59.041 --> 00:32:59.874
letters,

440
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.180
the power of these words,

441
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.380
but it's also a real challenge with kids,
with your own children.

442
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:14.410
It's a challenge because there's a whole crazy parental child psychology that's

443
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:18.440
going on here,
right?
You got the rebellion

444
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.730
or the trying to please you or the competing for attention or the,

445
00:33:24.731 --> 00:33:26.770
I can't do anything good enough.

446
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.600
You've got all these psychological things that are going on with your kids and

447
00:33:31.601 --> 00:33:33.430
it's hard.
It's,

448
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.850
it's can be very hard just to be straight with your kids about stuff.

449
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.240
It can be hard not to micromanage them.

450
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:45.080
That's one of the hardest things because you know so well all these things that

451
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:45.771
we just talked about,

452
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:50.771
you know them and you know that they're the best things for your kids and yet if

453
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:53.990
you push them too intensely,

454
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.720
they're going to push back or they're going to push it.

455
00:33:58.721 --> 00:34:01.990
They're going to head into different direction because you pushed him there.

456
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.850
But I,

457
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:09.850
I do think that there's some real value in taking the time to explain what

458
00:34:12.511 --> 00:34:15.960
you've learned,
the mistakes that you've made.

459
00:34:15.961 --> 00:34:20.670
And I think it's key not to so much focus on telling them how to live.

460
00:34:20.671 --> 00:34:24.840
I think this is the key is not so much focused on telling them how to live,

461
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.580
but telling them how you have lived,

462
00:34:29.581 --> 00:34:32.490
the mistakes that you've made and how you try to live

463
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:39.110
so that maybe they can

464
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.960
learn from some of the mistakes that you've made without

465
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.060
having to learn from life itself,

466
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:52.263
<v 2>which</v>

467
00:34:55.330 --> 00:35:00.310
<v 0>sometimes life is a much more brutal teacher.
In fact,</v>

468
00:35:00.311 --> 00:35:04.030
most of the time.
And if you have to learn from life,

469
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.760
sometimes you don't win

470
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.760
<v 2>harsh.
Yeah.</v>

471
00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.050
<v 0>Parenting is challenging</v>

472
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:23.670
<v 2>part that I've thought think is very important.</v>

473
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.880
The most important maybe is when you said our children are watching.

474
00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.220
So you know how remember the old saying,

475
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.020
<v 3>do what I say not what I do.
That doesn't work.
No.
Cause he tells someone,</v>

476
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:47.820
hey don't,
don't,
I dunno,
why don't smoke.
Don't,
don't,
don't try cigarettes.

477
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.810
Meanwhile you smoke there can be like,
okay,
don't try cigarettes.
You know,

478
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:55.680
whatever,
you know,
they're,
they're always white.
Like everyday,
all day,

479
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.430
every day they're watching to see how do I act?
I don't know how to,
I'm a kid.

480
00:35:59.431 --> 00:36:02.640
I don't know how to act.
I don't know what to do in this whole,

481
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:08.250
you know how like when you walk into a party of someone you don't know and maybe

482
00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:12.440
it's a really nice party or something and maybe it's a different culture or

483
00:36:12.441 --> 00:36:14.820
something like that.
You're looking around,
what do I act?

484
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:17.400
Are we taking off our shoes right here?
Okay.
And we're taking off our shoes.
Okay,

485
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:21.480
are we,
are we,
are we eating now or are we waiting for prayers on that will,
like,

486
00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:24.900
what do we do?
What do we do?
If you're constantly looking on how to add off kids,

487
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.980
that's their whole life.
How do I act?
I don't know how to act.

488
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.540
So of course you're there the whole time.
You've got things figured it out,

489
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.140
figured out you got a car,
you got a house,
you're providing my food,

490
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:41.190
you're going to show me how to act.
So you started saying,
hey,
don't smoke.

491
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:42.103
Meanwhile,

492
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:47.540
100% of the time you're acting in a way that allows for smoking and be like,

493
00:36:49.761 --> 00:36:50.150
oh,

494
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.300
<v 0>we're smoking it.
By the way,</v>

495
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:54.480
it's the same exact thing from a leadership perspective,

496
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.470
the way you act as a leader,
it's not at,

497
00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:02.070
I mean you're not going to have people that are as multiple as a kid is,

498
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.710
but there's no doubt if the way you act as leaders,

499
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:07.520
the way your team is going to act,
there's no dust.
That's 100% yeah,

500
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.710
and if you act like a clown,
you're team is going to act like clowns.

501
00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.710
If you take your job seriously,
your,

502
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.580
your team is going to take your job seriously.

503
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.020
If you're very well balanced in between those two where you,

504
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.540
you take your job seriously,
but you still have a good time.
We were doing it.

505
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.790
Your,
your team is going to follow you with that as well.

506
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.710
I remember when I was a new guy and a seal platoon,
I would be watching those,

507
00:37:28.711 --> 00:37:32.910
my leaders all the time and taking,
you know,
when they didn't do something,

508
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:36.030
when they didn't hold the line when they were late or didn't bring the right

509
00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:40.230
piece of gear,
it was just,
you just look at them and shake your head.

510
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:42.990
Now I wanted to perform,
but what that meant other people's like c,

511
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.880
it doesn't matter if we really performed that well.
Look,

512
00:37:44.881 --> 00:37:49.250
the boss doesn't even perform well and so you're setting the example.
Yeah.
Your,

513
00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:52.980
your subordinates are watching.
Everybody's watching this every month

514
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.970
<v 3>people will be like,
you know,
hey,
I'm the type of person that does this.
You know,</v>

515
00:37:56.971 --> 00:37:59.970
I really,
and everyone knows bad.
No you're not.

516
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.990
We've been watching you the whole time I've known you kind of thing.
So yeah,

517
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.970
especially like the boss to even even,

518
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.150
I mean you get all kinds of different people right.
In a,
in a work environment.

519
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:11.520
So you,
you're like driven.
It comes from yourself.

520
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.440
You're like really self motivated and stuff.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
Kind of.

521
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.630
So let's say even if you have a bunch of self motivated people,

522
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:22.860
they're still watching you like,

523
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:25.110
so if you're like kind of the leader and you're like,
hey,
you know,
we're getting,

524
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.920
we're punctual people.
We get our work done early,
like we're this guy.

525
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.350
And then meanwhile you're coming in late or whatever.

526
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:34.710
The boss is coming in late and he slacking.
You could tell he's slacking,

527
00:38:34.711 --> 00:38:36.160
he's passing like his job

528
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.620
<v 4>off,
you know,
on to others in the,
in that kind of stuff.</v>

529
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.160
At the very least they're going to look at you and not have the respect it.

530
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.490
I think you should have as a,
as a boss or whatever,
the very least.

531
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:52.750
And that's if you have self motivated people.
But otherwise the normal situation,

532
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:56.110
I man,
I remember feeling that all the time where it's like,
wow,
this,

533
00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:00.300
I'm not going to listen to this gay man man.
It's,

534
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.910
you know what's interesting too is just think about,

535
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.870
and I know we've done all their letters from parents,

536
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:12.871
especially from parents that are headed for GAF or at least a high probability

537
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:13.984
of death,

538
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.560
but what would you say to your kids if you knew you were heading there and is it

539
00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:25.141
not worth telling them that at some point while you're alive,

540
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.110
you know,
and,
and you can,
you can say,
hey,
look,

541
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.270
if you know I'm alive to tell you this stuff,

542
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.590
this is what I want you to know again.
Now what's crazy is,
even with that,

543
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.930
you have,
you can't override your kids with act this way.

544
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.900
You can't do that.
You got to approach it.
You got to flank them.

545
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.880
You got to flank them.
You've got,
I got to flank my kids.

546
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:53.050
You know,
they're not,
the classic example is my son,

547
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:58.690
he's good at Jujitsu,
right?
He's been trying to judge it to 10 years.
Right?

548
00:39:58.691 --> 00:40:01.600
He's 14 he's been been training in his whole life.
Right.

549
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.870
But he's,
he's not as good at Jujitsu as I am.
I mean he's just not,

550
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:11.040
cause he'd been training for 10 I've been training for 20 something new.

551
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.580
So you can beat him.
I can be,
yes,
yes,
but,
but check it out.

552
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:20.110
What's funny is I'm his dad,
so when I tell him,

553
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.910
hey son,
move your hips over here,
dude,
you don't need to do that.

554
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.360
I'm thinking to myself,
you've gotta be kidding me.
You gotta be kidding me.

555
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:29.680
That is the client.
To me,

556
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:34.681
that's the ultimate example of your kids are not going to listen to you.

557
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:39.370
They're programmed,
they're programmed to reject you.

558
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.930
At some point they have to move on,
right?
That's the way the species works.

559
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.400
If they just continue to take from you and they don't reject you at some point

560
00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:51.140
and get away from you,
then you didn't good.

561
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.190
Do a good job as a parent because now they're relying on you.
So,

562
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:58.590
but that comes a little price.
The price is that rebellion,
right?

563
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.730
The rebellions going to come and it's,
you know,
you can identify it.
You know,

564
00:41:03.731 --> 00:41:06.780
my youngest,
it's so nice.
You know,

565
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.030
you tell her something and she's just got the big eyes and she wants to help and

566
00:41:10.031 --> 00:41:11.750
wants to please and wants to do and,

567
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.810
and understands and I'll tell you something else.

568
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:17.110
There's another end of the spectrum too.
Cause my oldest daughter,

569
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:20.340
she went through the rebellion.

570
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.220
She's already through that and she got through it pretty quickly to where she

571
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:25.450
would like,
look at me.
I'm thinking,

572
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:28.960
I'm thinking you could see it in her eyes that she's thinking he knows what he's

573
00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:31.250
talking about and I'm going to listen to what he's saying now.

574
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.340
It's probably like a 50% is not.

575
00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:39.140
It's not 100% I'm not just dialing in 100% victory on telling her what to do

576
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:42.740
because otherwise what's sad about that?
This is what's horrible about that.

577
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:47.600
If you could get a child to actually do everything that you wanted them to do,

578
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.440
they would dominate in life,
right?
Because you would just say,
okay,

579
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.270
I want you to study hard.
I want you to work out.

580
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.320
I want you to do everything that I'm not doing it because I'm lazy and I fell

581
00:41:57.321 --> 00:42:00.680
short of my own goals.
You'd have them do all that stuff.

582
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.750
They're not going to do it,
so you've got to flank of,
you got to figure out.

583
00:42:04.751 --> 00:42:06.260
He also got to figure out which ones are important,

584
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.380
which ones are really important.
Don't waste your leadership capital on,

585
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.560
you know,
getting your kids to dress a certain way.
Right.
That's one.

586
00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:21.070
Parents will spend all kinds of leadership capital on getting their kids to wear

587
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:24.170
dress a certain way and the reality is,

588
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.030
you mean obviously you gotta,
you gotta remain,

589
00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:32.710
maintain some standard of decency and cleanliness.
Sure.

590
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:38.600
That's another lead by example.
Situ.
Yeah,
it is.
It is.

591
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.960
My daughters went through a little phase of wearing the short really short jeans

592
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.070
or not,
not jeans,
but shorts.
Yeah.
I was like,
okay,
cool.

593
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:51.500
I was walking around one day at my house.

594
00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:54.470
I had like a pair of workout shorts on or whatever.

595
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:58.910
I just pulled them right up and was just walking around.
How do I look?
Hey,

596
00:42:58.911 --> 00:43:01.010
if we're going to show off,
let's just show it off.
Hey,

597
00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:03.680
I got a little something too.
I do squats.
Check me out.

598
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:09.470
Big girls collapsed in agony.
Dad,

599
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:13.840
stop.
That's disgusting.
Yay.
If we're showing off butts,

600
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:18.320
let's show him off.
I'm over here on the squat,
but squat rack,

601
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.360
let's start it.
Got It.
Flaunt it.
You apparently are finding it.

602
00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.360
So let's all fall on it.
Let's go into town.
Who's coming with me?

603
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.710
You can only spend so much leadership capital on getting these minor corrections

604
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:33.981
made.

605
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:37.760
What you want to make sure is that they have good morals and values so it can
go,

606
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:38.683
go out in town.

607
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:42.860
They know where to draw the line on doing stuff that's good or not good.

608
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:46.220
You know,
somebody asked me a question on Twitter,

609
00:43:46.221 --> 00:43:48.560
I didn't actually answer it fully,
but you know,
he's like,
hey,

610
00:43:48.561 --> 00:43:50.510
you seem to be real black and white about good or evil,

611
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.570
but I think there's a lot of shades of gray in there.
And,
and I totally agree.

612
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:54.860
Of course.
I mean there's,

613
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:58.820
there's massive amounts of shades of gray in good and evil.

614
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:04.160
And then at some point you get to evil.
Then you go from like,
Hey,

615
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:08.570
this is bad to evil and you go from,
you know,
hey that's pretty nice too good.

616
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:12.830
Yeah.
Those,
those are things that exist and you want to keep your kids,

617
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:16.730
you know,
out of the evil.
Right.

618
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.600
And if you waste all your leadership capital trying to push them from doing okay

619
00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.490
to good and doing the best and you're going to wet,

620
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.270
you're going to wear it all out.
In my opinion.

621
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.130
If there's some parents that have done a better job than me,
that's awesome.

622
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:32.610
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

623
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:36.360
And they were able to just to keep their kid 5.0 in every category across the

624
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:40.620
board for their whole existence,
without the kid turning into a crazy,
you know,

625
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:45.240
rebel.
Cause that's what happens to some kids that get pushed that hard.

626
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:50.310
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that whole,
again,
that whole leading by example,

627
00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.460
thieman is lay as long as you're consistent and lead by example,

628
00:44:53.461 --> 00:44:57.330
they can see and all they'll see the benefits play out right in front of their

629
00:44:57.331 --> 00:45:01.740
face.
But man,
these again,
you can't,
you can't be like,
hey,

630
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:03.390
clean your room.
Meanwhile,
the rest of the house,

631
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.480
including your room is messy and grab clean.

632
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:10.080
I tell you to clean your room all the time.
You never do.
No.
How's this?

633
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.800
So one of my friends,
uh,

634
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.680
one of my best friends was Scotty Lewis.
He's a cop by the way,
you know,

635
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:21.000
on the big island.
So this guy would,

636
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:23.250
he was never my roommate,
but you know,

637
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:27.510
I go to this hustle at time and he was real like clank clean,
super clean guy.

638
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:32.160
And he'd get kind of mad,
not mad,
but just uncomfortable when things are dirty,

639
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.770
you know,
so,
you know,
he has a roommate or something like that.

640
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:37.890
And I remember thinking,
Dang,

641
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:41.340
both Scottie are real sensitive about that whole thing,
you know,

642
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.340
being clean and they're like for real clean,
clean,
a clean,
clean,

643
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:49.180
not a clean freak necessarily,
but almost borderline.
Borderline.
Yes.
So,
um,

644
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:54.270
and just from knowing them and stuff,
I knew that his parents,

645
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:58.350
they would like,
you know,
clean his room and stuff like that.

646
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.940
Not all the time or nothing like that.
But they were involved in,

647
00:46:00.941 --> 00:46:05.850
in cleaning and stuff.
So it Kinda went opposite to what I thought,
you know,

648
00:46:05.851 --> 00:46:07.380
how like if your parents tell,

649
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.280
if you got taught to clean your room from young age and you had to do it the

650
00:46:11.281 --> 00:46:13.500
whole time.
Yeah.
I always thought that,
yeah.

651
00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:16.530
That that would carry over when you're out of the house and you go to college,

652
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:19.140
you go live on your own,
that you cleaned your room all the time.

653
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.430
I thought that that was kind of it.

654
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:25.290
But I start to hypothesize that that's not it.
This is what it is.

655
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:30.420
If your parents provide in an environment of extreme cleanliness,

656
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.700
whether you do it or they do it or both or whatever,

657
00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:37.200
but the environment is consistently clean when you leave that environment,

658
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:39.660
that's will be,
that will be what you're used to interest.

659
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:44.280
So it'll mess with you if it's not.
And that's,
and sure enough,

660
00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.490
we went to the big island,
you know,
cruise with him and uh,

661
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:52.380
we go to his house and it's like a museum just spotless clean,
not his,

662
00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:56.100
his parent's house.
And I remember thinking like,
yeah,

663
00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.540
that my little theory I think is correct.
Like if you're used to it,

664
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.420
his parents help him clean or not.
Yes.
Fully.
So here,

665
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.710
and here's the thing about this,

666
00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:08.430
because you could also get the kid that the parents are neat freaks and the kid

667
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:11.820
rebels and just becomes a slob.
Yeah.
So and yeah,

668
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:15.600
maybe and I'm sure there's all kinds of circumstances that may be do that I'm

669
00:47:15.601 --> 00:47:17.670
sure.
But I mean generally speaking,

670
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.870
the environment that you get used to functioning,
there's PE,

671
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.680
there's parents that are slobs that the kids are very neat and orderly cause

672
00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:29.890
they don't like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean maybe,
and again these are all,

673
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.550
<v 5>you know,
I'm sure there's so many fat,
I've never encountered that.
Well My,</v>

674
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.560
I think the key is here,

675
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.040
what you can't do is just try and push him like crazy.

676
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.640
You just have to guide them in what is correct and what you have to really show

677
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:46.720
us,
like the benefits of why it's good to keep things in order.

678
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:47.830
You know,

679
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:52.300
if you're going to spend an hour looking for your car keys,

680
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.660
just think of your productivity at that point.
It's nil.

681
00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:01.660
So you've gotta watch out for that.
But yeah,
that was my little hypothesis.

682
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.760
I think it's true though,
because think about it,
like,

683
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:07.690
think about just the environment of the consistent environment that you kind of,

684
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:13.180
that someone will come from the always in a way,
sort of,

685
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:14.380
for lack of a better term,
create,

686
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:17.770
recreate that environment or try to when they leave.
So like,

687
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.230
you know how like kids would come from a chaotic,
people yell,

688
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.560
they're going to probably yell a lot.
Or let's say they don't yell,

689
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:25.680
let's say they never swear right there.

690
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.530
Like I grew up in a household and they don't swear and swearing like not that

691
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:31.310
good when they go out.
They won't just start swearing though.

692
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:35.260
They'll be sensitive to swearing,
freestyle,
you know?
For sure.
So I think that,
uh,

693
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.190
again,
if,
if the environment is provided consistently,
I think that's,

694
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:42.430
that's going to have a big consistency goes a long way.

695
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:44.290
I think it's the number one thing.

696
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.070
Sarah Armstrong always says that I agree with us.
Thousand million.
Christine.

697
00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:51.320
Consistent,
even like small little things like,
uh,

698
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.110
for my daughter for example,

699
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:57.010
it's the routine is when it's time to go to bed,

700
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.510
it's brushed teeth.
We do stories and questions,
which is like,
just like,
you know,

701
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:04.840
some stories,
I mean up and then questions like basically a quiz.

702
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.730
It's like rudimentary education,

703
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:11.020
like solar system stuff and you make it like a game show quiz.
So it's fun.

704
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.710
And then bedtime.
That's it.
Then sleep

705
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:21.070
hundred percent,
no deviation unless we're out.
But that's how,
that's the routine.

706
00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:22.930
Consistent.
So now you need,

707
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.730
I don't get any pushback and my daughter is a pushback master.

708
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.190
The consistent stuff.
She just knows.
She just go,
you can be playing.
She's,

709
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:36.640
she's got a little spark to her.
Yeah.
Actually it's got a lot of,
sparked her.

710
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:41.470
Yeah.
Got It from mom.
Yeah.

711
00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:44.350
There's just a ton of,
you know,
I,
as I was going through these,

712
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.340
I don't remember where I let read the,
um,
you know,

713
00:49:48.341 --> 00:49:52.450
I don't remember where I'd read this letter for the first time from Michelada

714
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.930
horror.
Cova but there's so much

715
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.150
good stuff in there.
Choose your friends carefully.

716
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:06.040
I'm interested just when she's kicking it off,
you know,
life is hard.

717
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:10.240
It does not pamper anybody.
That's a good thing for kids to understand.
Yeah.

718
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:14.170
You know,
welcome to life.
It's going to be hard.
Get accustomed to it,

719
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:16.290
but don't let it defeat you.
Boom.
Yeah.

720
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.830
That changing of your opinion.
One was,
yeah,

721
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.840
new powerful online and admitting when you're wrong.
Hey,
if I made this decision,

722
00:50:23.841 --> 00:50:28.040
if I made,
if I had the wrong theory,
that's okay.
Yeah.

723
00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.550
Just give me information,
new information.
Here we go.
I'm changing.
That's okay.

724
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.470
That was kind of freaked me out with politicians.

725
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:35.840
I think we've had this conversation,
we've had this conversation before.

726
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.760
Politicians,
people say,
oh,
he's a flip flop.
Flip flop or,
yeah,

727
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:39.920
and that's a negative thing.

728
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:43.520
It's a negative thing if the person is flip flopping just to get votes,

729
00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.580
but as new stuff comes to light and they say,
you know what,

730
00:50:46.581 --> 00:50:51.470
I kind of changed my opinion on that one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or the culture shifts,

731
00:50:51.471 --> 00:50:54.620
man.
Like there's certain things that even,
I mean,
back to your thing,

732
00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:57.740
but the short shorts,
that's,
I mean,
point here is a little bit different,

733
00:50:57.741 --> 00:51:02.280
but you have to contend with cultural shift.
For me,

734
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:07.130
like in,
in Hawaii for example,
when I grew up,
like just the swimsuits,
um,
we're,

735
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.910
you know,
sure you wear a bikini,
but it's like a normal bikini.
So I come,

736
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:15.650
I go to college,
I come here and move here,
I go back.
This is like,
you know,

737
00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:19.610
10,
11 years later I'm noticing the Bikini's in there.

738
00:51:19.611 --> 00:51:23.240
It's just way less material and I'm like,
Dang this.
They're showing a lot,

739
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:25.910
but everyone's just,
you know,
little kids and stuff like that.
I'm okay.

740
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.540
And my younger brother who lives there,
he said,
that's just how it is now.

741
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.531
He's like,
man,
you,

742
00:51:30.531 --> 00:51:33.680
you wouldn't have gotten away with some stuff that I had to like go,
okay,

743
00:51:33.681 --> 00:51:38.660
I'm not going to expend a bunch of leadership capital fighting.
Not just my kids,

744
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:41.650
but fighting culture as a whole.
Yeah.
That's,

745
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.670
then there's things that crossed the line,
right?
Yeah.
I'll tell you,

746
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:48.060
are you wearing those short shorts?
That's bad.

747
00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.340
You're gonna want to see me in those short shorts.

748
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:57.860
You don't want to have that happen.
So,
um,
like I said,

749
00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:02.570
ton of good information from cap and Isaacson from

750
00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.670
Dr Horell Cova.
Um,
but you know,

751
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:12.730
speaking of learning and teaching and questioning,

752
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.380
speaking of question time,
sure.

753
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.680
I think we got a little question time to contend with who Q.

754
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:21.613
And A.
Yeah.
Might as well

755
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:28.910
ask Jocko some questions.
Let's do that.
I like your answers to questions.
Junk.

756
00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.650
See that's kind of the good thing about knowing your phone number.

757
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:38.510
I can just text you with questions,
my own questions,

758
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.140
a gross mismanagement of your time essentially.
However,

759
00:52:42.141 --> 00:52:47.141
I'm pretty quick to answer abruptly and short answers because you pretty much

760
00:52:49.521 --> 00:52:51.170
know what the answer is going to be.
I do.

761
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:53.980
And sometimes you just need that backup and that's,
or that,
that,

762
00:52:53.981 --> 00:52:56.990
that reinforcement.
You know how like you're like,
man,

763
00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:02.080
I really having this issue with myself.
Whatever you like.

764
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:06.590
I'm going to,
I'm going to ask Jocko one cause it's really,
I'm really confused.

765
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.040
Not Confused,
but you know,
I'm really,
I need the answer.
I don't have the,

766
00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:11.720
I'm really,
when I'm going to ask Jacqueline,

767
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:16.640
you can be texting Jocko the answer or the question and you're like,

768
00:53:16.641 --> 00:53:19.430
I know that like as I'm reading this question to Jocko,

769
00:53:19.431 --> 00:53:24.190
it kind of puts it in so don't send it.
So you get about maybe a third name,

770
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:25.950
like a quarter.
The questions

771
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:30.300
<v 4>that I actually started for you.
Yeah,
that's good.
Yeah man.</v>

772
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:35.310
It's the good,
the chocolate fact.
Israel question number one,
Jocko.

773
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.550
I keep trying to ask around my BJJ school,

774
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:41.040
if anyone follows s NC program.

775
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:45.000
Did you just abbreviate SNC know what that is,
right?
No.
Oh,

776
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:47.580
it's strength and conditioning.
Okay,
sure.

777
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.190
100% that's like a known that that's a known thing.

778
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:56.850
Especially for someone that's jacked like yourselves into strength and

779
00:53:56.851 --> 00:54:00.630
conditioning.
I don't write,
I've never seen that.
Maybe don't write that.

780
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:05.530
Maybe I just do it through credit.
Mike drop.
You can go home now.

781
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.620
Anyway,
I'm asking around my Jujitsu school.

782
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:14.580
If anyone follows a strength and conditioning program for comps,

783
00:54:14.581 --> 00:54:19.290
which he has competition.
Nicely done.
You're up on,

784
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.550
everyone keeps telling me to just roll for strength and conditioning.

785
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:28.590
What do you think about that?
Okay,
so rolling is obviously the base.

786
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:32.040
Sure.
Right.
You need to roll and that that has to that this,

787
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:35.400
it doesn't mean include rolling.
Yeah.
Like we're going to go roll.

788
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:36.840
However it works out.

789
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.770
It means rolling with some kind of structure around it.

790
00:54:40.771 --> 00:54:45.660
So you get your short rounds.
Okay.
You got to get your long rounds.

791
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.140
You got to get your shark tanks,
you got to get your positional drilling,

792
00:54:49.141 --> 00:54:51.060
you got to get your consequence free.

793
00:54:51.061 --> 00:54:56.061
Drills like Dean lister makes us do consequence free drills where you're going

794
00:54:58.191 --> 00:55:01.530
to start in a position where you might get tapped out,
but it doesn't matter.

795
00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:04.530
Right?
Right.
Or you're going to start a position where you might lose position,

796
00:55:04.531 --> 00:55:06.900
but you're going to do it anyways.
And then Glover,

797
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.090
that's what Dean does actually.

798
00:55:09.091 --> 00:55:13.090
Glover does the consequence drills where you're already stuck,

799
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:18.320
like starting in the arm lock that you're letting a person take your arm and

800
00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:20.880
you're starting there and you're just gonna see what she can get out of it or

801
00:55:20.881 --> 00:55:24.690
start in the triangle,
not the triangle.
Danger in the triangle.

802
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.710
That's some Jeff Glover,
you know,
we did that together.
Crap right there.

803
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:34.110
But it's good for you.
It's good.
So you gotta,
you gotta do that.

804
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:37.170
You don't end the short rounds.
By short rounds,
I mean short,
intense rounds.
Yeah,

805
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:38.770
right.
If you,
I,

806
00:55:38.771 --> 00:55:43.771
my attitude in a three minute round is completely different than my attitude in

807
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:49.830
a 20 minute round or even,
I mean the,
the ultimate,
and believe it or not,

808
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.820
my attitude in a 20 minute round is different from my attitude in a no time

809
00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:59.700
limit round.
Really?
Yeah.
Right.

810
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:04.680
Especially because in regular training,
even if you get the submission,

811
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.050
if I submit you in four minutes,
I still got them new,

812
00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:13.080
another 16 so I might go all hard for four minutes and get the submission.

813
00:56:13.651 --> 00:56:16.110
But then I've got to go to another 16 minutes now.
So I'm going to,

814
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:20.100
I'm going to have some tactical now if we're now what's different is if it's no

815
00:56:20.101 --> 00:56:23.620
time limit after four minutes,
I get you.
We're,
we're kind of done.

816
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.380
We can go again.
Yeah.
We can just be done.
Right.
I got you.

817
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.240
But if you get them in one minute,
we're probably going to get,
yeah,

818
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:35.380
it's like an MP.
Four minutes is probably going again too,
but like eight minutes.

819
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.730
So I might,

820
00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:42.210
I might not submit you in one minute or even four minutes cause I want to get

821
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:46.920
you to a point where I know I'm just going to have to do this and wanted to die

822
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:53.340
and the psychology.
Uh,
but so yes,
you have to roll now you,

823
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:56.680
but you still need to get stronger.
Right.
And a classic example,

824
00:56:56.681 --> 00:56:59.050
this is a big Andy Big Andy Berke,
right.

825
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:03.870
Great Jujitsu but wasn't super strong.
Yeah.

826
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.180
And I was,
I said to him,
hey,
we started doing pull ups,

827
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:10.240
start doing pushups and dips and squats.
Just start to him.
And he did,

828
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:15.750
he listened to me and in a matter of a month he fell completely different cause

829
00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:19.630
he wasn't working on raw,
he was just rolling and he's rolling hardcore,

830
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:24.580
but just rolling compared to actually getting stronger.
I,
and then he went on to

831
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:29.080
power lifting and Olympic lifting and,
and now it's like,
okay,

832
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.520
I got to contend with actual strength and power here.

833
00:57:31.521 --> 00:57:34.600
So that definitely makes a difference.
You know,
his skill was getting better,

834
00:57:34.601 --> 00:57:36.850
but it wasn't,
I was feeling a skill getting better,
you know,

835
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:37.990
but we're all getting a bit of at the same time,

836
00:57:37.991 --> 00:57:40.330
but all of a sudden he started getting stronger.
So strength,

837
00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.260
that's the strength part right now,
the conditioning part,
same thing.

838
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:49.890
Jujitsu allows you to rest and that's actually a positive attribute of your

839
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:54.670
Jujitsu game.
If you can rest while you're doing it right,

840
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:58.420
that's well that's one of the good that that proves that you know what you're

841
00:57:58.421 --> 00:58:00.640
doing now,

842
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:03.700
that's actually a negative when it comes to working out.

843
00:58:03.701 --> 00:58:08.701
Because if you do something like a row or a bike or a sprint or a metcon workout

844
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:13.930
on a timer,
there are no mercy.
Slacking is not rewarded.

845
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:18.250
You're,
you're,
you're,
you're racing against the clock.

846
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.540
And so those things are gonna push you faster for longer periods of time.

847
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:27.370
Harder than just a role.
Well.
So bottom line

848
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:32.800
for strength and conditioning in Jujitsu,
yeah,

849
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:34.750
you got to do Jujitsu for sure.

850
00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:40.360
Gotta be your base and then you've got to do strength training to get stronger.

851
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.400
That's deads and squats and cleaning jerks and snatches,

852
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:48.940
overhead squats and all the key lifts and do it.

853
00:58:48.941 --> 00:58:53.830
That means doing singles and doubles and fours and fives and sets a 20 I mean it

854
00:58:53.831 --> 00:58:55.030
means getting stronger

855
00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:59.740
and then you got to work your metabolic conditioning and how do you do that?

856
00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:06.130
You go hard,
you go metabolic conditioning.
You Do,
you do metcons,
right?

857
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:11.050
You mix in lighter weights,
doing more repetitions short,

858
00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:14.020
and you've got to mix up the realms to going short rounds,

859
00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:17.410
long rounds to Bob diener tomatoes.
Yes.

860
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:21.540
The tabata protocol,
I don't know the exact,
is their exact numbers?

861
00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:25.740
An exact number,
exact number for the Tabata protocol?
Sure.

862
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:32.330
Is 30 30 nope.
20 seconds of work.
10 seconds of rest.

863
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:32.750
Okay,

864
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:36.260
so for me that's like the shortest rounds you're doing is 20 seconds of work,

865
00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:40.970
10 seconds of rest.
Then you got all stu long rounds and then you do,
you know,

866
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:45.830
a lot of times I do three on one off for rounds.
That's a boxing,
right?

867
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.160
A lot of times I'm doing five on one off that's

868
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:54.140
MMA.
And then above that you start to get to Jujitsu,

869
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:56.630
which is 10 minutes one off.

870
00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:01.070
But what's interesting is if you're doing a 10 minute round and then one off and

871
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:04.220
then another 10 year round in the one off,
that blurs into one big round.

872
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.310
So a lot of times when we're did got a guy that's competing with black belch or

873
01:00:08.311 --> 01:00:11.810
uh,
or he's doing a 20 minute fight or a 10 minute fight,

874
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.970
a 20 minute 10 minute grappling match,

875
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:16.700
one round of 10 minutes or one round of 50 minutes,

876
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:21.590
you've got to have him take a bigger break in between sometimes during the

877
01:00:21.591 --> 01:00:22.880
training so that they're actually coming in,

878
01:00:22.881 --> 01:00:24.820
they're fresh and they can work through the problem again.

879
01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:29.850
Otherwise they're just going through the one hour role level the whole time,

880
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:33.020
which is not good for him.
Um,

881
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.760
and obviously you got to learn technique.

882
01:00:35.761 --> 01:00:40.010
You're gonna practice technique cause Jujitsu is what's going to win.

883
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.840
And like I just had somebody hit me up on social media and they said,
cause I,

884
01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:48.841
I told the story at some point on this podcast about rolling with a black belt

885
01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:52.820
girl for the first time was the first time I ever rolled with an actual

886
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:55.160
blackbelt grown.
I was,
thanks,
sinking all,
you know,

887
01:00:55.161 --> 01:00:57.950
I better bring my a game a little bit so I don't get caught here.

888
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.320
And then I want to,
as soon as I started rolling with,
I was like,

889
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:02.870
that's not happening.
And the guy says,

890
01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:06.230
does this mean that you can't defeat a stronger opponent with Jujitsu?

891
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:10.610
And I said,
no,
absolutely.
I watched girls lighter,

892
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:15.710
weaker girls tap out,
bigger,
stronger guys on the regular.

893
01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.720
But what were,
what,

894
01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:22.100
what that situation was not only was I bigger and stronger,

895
01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:26.880
but I'm also skilled at Jujitsu.
Yes.
So it doesn't apply.
Yeah.

896
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:31.490
<v 3>And there's this element of Jujitsu and this actually kind of goes back to,
um,</v>

897
01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.460
when Andy,
when you know,
when you get Andy with his,

898
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:40.490
his skill and technique and then you add some strength and conditioning to it

899
01:01:41.371 --> 01:01:44.550
and it's like,
you know,
so what you do if you,
if you don't have,

900
01:01:44.551 --> 01:01:46.110
if you're not big and strong,

901
01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.980
you can't really believe anyone on the mat and bully.
I don't mean Billy,
Billy.

902
01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:54.800
I mean like you can't just turn on this like you're saying if you're not.
Yeah,

903
01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.260
yeah.
If you were saying Jeff Glover,
people cause I have,

904
01:01:58.290 --> 01:02:02.930
well he bullies in in a different way.
So that's what I mean by bullied.

905
01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:07.320
Like you can't just impose your strength on someone.
Well,

906
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.100
I'm going to have to disagree with you.
Impose your techniques,
I think.
Yeah,

907
01:02:11.101 --> 01:02:14.940
I mean Jeff Glover will bully guys on the mat if they're on the line for sure

908
01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:18.510
hundred percent.
And it's in a different kind of way.
They were talking about you,

909
01:02:18.511 --> 01:02:20.250
well you can't go strength.

910
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.240
<v 5>You can't just start bullying.
Physically bullying.
Yeah.</v>

911
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.920
You have to technically bullied up.
Yes,
I'll accept that.

912
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.760
So let's say your technique is,
is similar,

913
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:35.760
but you have straight up weight,
strength and conditioning.

914
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.910
It really plays a big chapter for sure.

915
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.790
And not to say that you'll be able to necessarily top the guy out,

916
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:46.530
but him trying to tap you out when you have strength conditioning,

917
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:49.470
insides,
size,
it's like it,
it just gets real hard for sure.

918
01:02:49.471 --> 01:02:51.390
And then less you love you.

919
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:55.760
The key component there that you mentioned is that I have to have similar,
yeah,

920
01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:01.100
cause you can be a 235 pound like guy,

921
01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:04.530
super strong athlete.
And if you don't know Jay Jujitsu,

922
01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:06.300
Jeff Glover is going to wrap you up.

923
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:10.610
Like you don't even know what's happening and he's 150 pounds.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

924
01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:15.900
And He,
and I've seen him with that obviously with what,
roughly 100% certainty.

925
01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.000
Yeah.
Well I,
you know,

926
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.570
even beyond roughly 100% he is really,

927
01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:24.060
really close to 100% if you don't know Jujitsu,

928
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:28.950
245 pound muscle head going against Jeff Glover,

929
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.870
you're getting tapped out.
And if you do know what you just said,

930
01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:35.040
there's the area for sure.
There was a video I think is grapplers quest.

931
01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:38.570
I think it's still online right now.
Jeff lower gold goes against this huge guy,

932
01:03:38.571 --> 01:03:41.630
that's for sure.
I think he was maybe,
and that guy knew something.

933
01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.740
And you did sue fighter.
Yeah.
It was a Jujitsu match and hell man,
it's,
yeah,

934
01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:49.800
it's just crazy to a lot.
That was when Jeff was like 13 or so

935
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:57.270
and he was crazy back then.
He's still crazy.
But yeah.
Um,
yeah,

936
01:03:57.271 --> 01:04:00.840
so the girl,
the girl thing,
and I remember that question,
it was on Twitter,
right?

937
01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:04.440
Yeah.
It was like,
Hey,
it doesn't do you do to allow you,
yes.
Yeah.
So they get,

938
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.780
yeah,
perfect.
Exact.

939
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.040
I mean that's the answer there because yeah,
you have all this experience,

940
01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:13.470
but you know how like how we always talk about like when you lock up with

941
01:04:13.471 --> 01:04:14.530
someone,
you know,

942
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:17.730
you can get a really good idea of what they're about to bring to you.

943
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.020
This is James Nielsen and you lock up and you're like,
what is it about?

944
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:26.850
This should be pretty easy.
All I'm getting swept for sure.
For sure.

945
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:29.820
There are exceptions for sure,
but generally speaking,
you know,

946
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:34.830
even just not even beyond just strength strengthen and their grip in their

947
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:39.390
rigidity and then you don't feel the,
you can feel the either like they're,

948
01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.750
they're relaxed.
To me that's an indicator.
Yeah.

949
01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:44.670
Someone that just likes one of them.
Yeah.
They feel relaxed.
You're like,
okay,

950
01:04:44.671 --> 01:04:45.180
this is,

951
01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.490
this guy probably knows what he's doing because the person that doesn't know

952
01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:49.440
what they're doing,
they're going all psycho.
Yes.
Doing,

953
01:04:49.441 --> 01:04:53.350
making like little micro moves that are incorrect,
you know?
Yeah.

954
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:55.230
Just even putting their foot right there.
It's like,
Bro,

955
01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:57.610
your split should not be right there right now kind of thing.
Yeah.

956
01:04:57.611 --> 01:05:02.130
You can tell real quick.
Yeah.
So,
but it does go into the strength part as well.

957
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:02.521
So like,

958
01:05:02.521 --> 01:05:05.610
you know when you grab someone's wrist or they grab your wrist or something like

959
01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:08.250
that,
you're like,
okay,
because you just said this is weird.

960
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:11.980
A lot of Jujitsu is knowing what's important and what's not in first.

961
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:16.140
So you know these,
that's not just jujitsu either.
Let's talk about that with,

962
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:19.150
with kids and with me,
a leader when you want to expand your leadership capital,

963
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:23.320
trying to get your Dick trying to get your team to do something that's not

964
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.620
really truly necessary.
Yeah,
that's not going to help your cause.
It'll,

965
01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.160
and it's not going to help you in Jujitsu if you're focused on something that's

966
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:30.910
not important.

967
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:34.120
And to know what's important and what's not is very important as a leader,

968
01:05:34.121 --> 01:05:38.490
as a parent and as on the Gigi to play or Matt of Justice and,

969
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:43.430
and very hard by the way,
it takes like a lot of experiences.

970
01:05:43.431 --> 01:05:45.460
So you consider these guys who are,
um,

971
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:49.870
like if you do a light roll with a really,
really high level guy,

972
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.910
that's when you can start to see,
okay,

973
01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:55.870
this guy really thinks that this arm position is really important because he'll,

974
01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.790
he'll fight to the death to kind of maintain it,
you know?
So,

975
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:02.740
but what the back just back to the girl real quick.
The girl's situation,

976
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.080
when you lock up with someone's strength wise,
you know,

977
01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.240
you feel like I said you what they're about to bring.
So again,
and when you have,

978
01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:14.080
the more experience you have,
the more you're going to know with more accuracy.

979
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.130
And I think that's what you need.

980
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:19.270
And actually this point of taking that point and transferring it into leadership

981
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:21.910
is so critical.
And I'll tell you,

982
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:27.390
I am really good at knowing what's important and what's not and just be,

983
01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:33.440
and you can see people that get all spun up about things and you know,

984
01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:37.210
just okay,
they're spun up about something to do.
The same thing with family life.

985
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.410
You know,
your,
your wife gets all spun up about something and I'm like,
oh,

986
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.273
what are we going to do?

987
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:44.320
We're going to keep doing what we're doing and we're going to be okay.
You know,

988
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:47.470
Oh,
you want to focus all your time and energy on that?
That's fine.
Go ahead.

989
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.620
You know,
and that's cool.
I'll support you and you can make it happen.

990
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:52.090
But you know,

991
01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:55.360
think about how important something really is when you're getting spun up about

992
01:06:55.361 --> 01:06:57.910
something.
Just think about how important it really is.

993
01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.850
There's a good chance it's not that important.

994
01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.140
There's a really good chance it's not that important.
Yeah.

995
01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:08.260
There's usually four or five things that are really important as a leader that

996
01:07:08.261 --> 01:07:12.310
you need to focus on that list.
The further you go down that list,

997
01:07:12.311 --> 01:07:13.390
the less important things are.

998
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.630
And I see leaders get spun up on things that are in the list on the list,

999
01:07:16.631 --> 01:07:20.430
number 47 and they're acting like it's the most important thing and it's going

1000
01:07:20.431 --> 01:07:25.420
to ruin everything.
And it's like,
no,
it doesn't.
Not that big of a deal.
Yeah.

1001
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:29.590
So learn that.
Is that why you wear the same clothes every day?

1002
01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:33.100
You know,
I wear the same because fashion is not important.

1003
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:37.840
It's not important to me.
Those short rounds or good,

1004
01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:41.110
when you do short rounds and you'd get to and they kind of trick you too.

1005
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.750
Jeff will do that.
He'll be like,
oh,
three minute rounds.

1006
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:46.210
So you'd have this thing in your head like,
oh,
it's only three minutes.

1007
01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:47.283
Just go hard.

1008
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.320
But meanwhile you only got 30 seconds rest before you got to go again.

1009
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:53.290
So you're doing essentially a metcon do you do too.
That's good.

1010
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:57.430
That is good for that kind of stuff.
Yeah,
man.
It's good.
Yeah,
I agree.

1011
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:58.990
I like the straight.
Someone got,

1012
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.140
some guys say you don't need strength and conditioning because the more the

1013
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:05.300
anytime you spend doing physical activities should be on your Jujitsu.
They said,

1014
01:08:05.301 --> 01:08:09.640
it's interesting.
I would like to group that.
It sounds good,

1015
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:13.690
but I would do,
if I'm going to do Jiu Jitsu six hours a day,

1016
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.920
I'd still do strength and conditioning 20 minutes,

1017
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.490
<v 3>half an hour,
45 minutes.
That's one of the good things about you did.</v>

1018
01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:23.330
So you can have different philosophies and still be successful because there's,

1019
01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:28.340
that is true.
I think like Dylan Dennis or something.
Maybe Marcel.

1020
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.210
Marcel Garcia only does gene and dean used to always try and convince me that

1021
01:08:32.530 --> 01:08:36.230
it's going to do Jitsu.
Yeah,
and I'd say no.
We'll dean talk crazy strong though.

1022
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.490
I know he's easy to say.
Oh,

1023
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:43.100
I don't know.
I don't do grip strengths writing.

1024
01:08:43.101 --> 01:08:45.920
I can hold them for a full six hours.

1025
01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.940
So check.
All right,
next question Jocko.

1026
01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.940
I have a question about leadership.

1027
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.130
I'm a firefighter and some one of the guys on my department have been pushing me

1028
01:08:58.131 --> 01:08:58.964
to step up,

1029
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:05.160
input in for an officer's position and I'm honored.
But when we're one,

1030
01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.450
when we were going to a call,

1031
01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:10.630
I was presented with an opportunity to lead and passed it up.

1032
01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.730
I didn't know what I was thinking.
I can't believe I did that.

1033
01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:20.530
Did I just lose credibility if I did?
Is there

1034
01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.220
Oh,
was to get back that back away,
right?
That's what he meant.
If I did,

1035
01:09:26.221 --> 01:09:27.240
is there a way to get that back

1036
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:31.630
<v 4>sex?
Okay,
so first of all,
this is just a general rule.</v>

1037
01:09:31.631 --> 01:09:35.260
If you want to lead,
always be ready to leave,
right?
Be ready to step up.

1038
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:40.690
Make sure you're not stepping on people's toes as always,
but be ready to lead.

1039
01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.760
And the way you do that,
as you think about you,

1040
01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:45.340
what you do in certain situations,
you should always be thinking about that.

1041
01:09:45.341 --> 01:09:46.660
You should be thinking,

1042
01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:50.500
even if you were a trooper or a follower in a certain situation,

1043
01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:53.530
you should think,
okay,
well how would I leave?
What would I do right now?

1044
01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.180
What moves would I make?

1045
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.890
What would I do if for contingency happened right now and what are the possible

1046
01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:01.570
contingencies that I can be looking at?
What are they?

1047
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:05.050
And if you're thinking that as a,
as a

1048
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:08.390
frontline guy,

1049
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:12.800
when the opportunity pops up and then just jump on it and boom,
there you go.

1050
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.230
Then when it does happen,

1051
01:10:15.231 --> 01:10:20.060
of course you got to stay detached because you want to make sure that you don't

1052
01:10:20.061 --> 01:10:24.140
lead too far.
You don't overstep your bounds and step on toes.

1053
01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:25.130
You've got to be careful of that.

1054
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:30.790
So you need to live with that mindset and that will make you such a better

1055
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:33.350
leader when the moment does come.

1056
01:10:33.351 --> 01:10:35.310
If you're always thinking about if you're always watching,

1057
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.340
like he talked about earlier,
I'm watching the leader,

1058
01:10:37.341 --> 01:10:39.410
I'm seeing what they're doing,
I'm seeing what I might do differently.

1059
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.960
I'm still supporting them.
I'm supporting you.
If you're in charge,

1060
01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:44.030
I'm supporting you,
but I'm thinking I might,
I might do this,

1061
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.410
and then you watch what would my,

1062
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.990
what would the results of my decision had been compared to what they did?
So you,

1063
01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:53.420
you can be thinking like leader even though you might not necessarily be in a

1064
01:10:53.421 --> 01:10:54.560
leadership position.

1065
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.960
So live with that mindset.
That's what you need to do.

1066
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:04.470
Now as far as you passing up the opportunity
to lead,

1067
01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.220
which yes,
you're admitting was an error.
First of all,
I'll say this,
it probably,

1068
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:14.030
it's probably not quite as obvious to everyone else as it is to in your mind you

1069
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.060
if they get all man,
I blew it.
This was my chance and PR.
No,

1070
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.770
I bet the guys went back from that call and didn't even think about it.

1071
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:24.220
Didn't even think about it again.
Most likely,
unless it was just some flake rent.

1072
01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:27.060
I don't want to lead.
I wrote already.
If you did that well then yeah,

1073
01:11:27.061 --> 01:11:28.620
people are going with that.
But if you just said,

1074
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.920
if you just kind of backed away from a moment and people,

1075
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:35.460
people might have realized it.
But anyways,
regardless of that,

1076
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.300
you probably guess what I'm gonna say.
Then what you gotta do is own it.
Right?

1077
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.550
You got to own it.
Hmm.

1078
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.160
So when the opportunity presents itself to explain what happened and what went

1079
01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:52.050
wrong and what you did wrong,
right?
Not Making excuses,

1080
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:57.240
but explain where you were weak,
you know,
so you say,

1081
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:59.520
hey guys,
you know,
hey,

1082
01:11:59.521 --> 01:12:03.990
remember that last call I should have stepped up and I had to have the wrong

1083
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:07.980
mindset.
I wasn't ready to lead and I let it.
Not only did I let you guys down,

1084
01:12:07.981 --> 01:12:11.940
I let myself down and I'm not going to let that happen again.
From now on,

1085
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.280
I'm going to have leadership in the front of my mind.

1086
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:15.114
That's what I'm going to do.

1087
01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:18.030
I'm going to be thinking about what needs to get done.

1088
01:12:18.031 --> 01:12:21.600
I'm rethinking about contingencies and how I'm going to lead,

1089
01:12:21.601 --> 01:12:24.360
and I promise the next time this opportunity comes up,

1090
01:12:24.361 --> 01:12:25.290
I'm going to be ready to lead.

1091
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:29.640
So I'm sorry for letting you guys down and won't happen again.
Okay?

1092
01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.880
That's,
that's it.
Boom.

1093
01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.490
Get the mindset live and think as a leader,

1094
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:43.350
regardless of what position you're actually in,
and then when they call you in,

1095
01:12:43.351 --> 01:12:47.970
the operative tunity presents itself.
Step up and lead.

1096
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:53.150
Obviously that's your default mindset now.

1097
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:55.890
Yes,
it seems obvious to me.

1098
01:12:56.070 --> 01:13:00.810
It is truly was it always like that?
And even before,

1099
01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:04.260
it's that story that I've told over and over again about being on an oil rig and

1100
01:13:04.261 --> 01:13:09.261
covering up and guys not knowing where to go or everyone freezing and me going,

1101
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.150
okay,
let me just to step back and look around and make a call.

1102
01:13:12.151 --> 01:13:13.320
And when I did that,
that was it.

1103
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:18.240
And so I clicked it clicked or I would say,

1104
01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:20.960
I guess I was thinking about it beforehand because I was,
you know,

1105
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.580
observing my leaders and thinking about what they were doing and what I would do

1106
01:13:23.581 --> 01:13:25.560
differently in a certain situation.
Yeah.

1107
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:29.640
<v 3>Yeah.
That's crazy.
Cause even in everyday life,</v>

1108
01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:34.860
which is what I represent everyday life,
but you know how you life or girl,

1109
01:13:34.861 --> 01:13:38.820
whatever is like,
Hey,
well you know,
what's the dinner situation?

1110
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.080
What do you want?
Oh I don't care.
Whenever you want.
You know,

1111
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:47.760
that's a time where I,
I always feel this,
what this guy just asked,
you know,

1112
01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:53.490
I mean obviously it's nothing compared to his situation,
but they're like,
hey,

1113
01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:55.800
well,
you know,
what are you thinking for dinner kind of thing.
And I'm like,
Hey,

1114
01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:58.080
I don't,
I don't care.
And that's really how I feel.
I don't care.

1115
01:13:58.081 --> 01:14:01.200
I'm done kind of down for whatever and of thing.
But that's not why,

1116
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.360
that's not why she's asking me.
She wants me,
she wants me to make that decision.

1117
01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:09.150
She wasn't mean to take stuff up and lead,
step up and be like,

1118
01:14:09.151 --> 01:14:10.830
this is what we're having for dinner.
I'm going to go get her,

1119
01:14:10.831 --> 01:14:12.190
I'm going make it or whatever.
That's

1120
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:13.980
<v 5>what she wants.
And really those little,
those,</v>

1121
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:15.870
that situation comes up all the time.

1122
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.020
Like you know the old that the Joe actually,
that's kind of like a joke.
You know,

1123
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:23.200
when you ask the girl when a girl says,
or when you ask her,
hey,

1124
01:14:23.201 --> 01:14:25.300
what do you want to eat?
And she says,
I don't,
I don't care.
Whatever.

1125
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.160
And then you say,
okay,
we're going to go eat here because they,

1126
01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:31.120
I don't really like that.
Of course.
See?
Yeah you got to,
yeah.

1127
01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:34.690
I feel like this guy when,
when I do that though,
that's the point.

1128
01:14:34.691 --> 01:14:37.780
They're now under going to step up and I'm going to do it yet but I want it to

1129
01:14:37.781 --> 01:14:41.410
be my default is why you don't like yours is like your default I into Oh this is

1130
01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:42.690
what we're doing.
There you go.
Okay.

1131
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:47.380
That was true with her when it did come to dinner actually know what kind of is

1132
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:50.610
true cause I only go to like three places to eat.
Yes.

1133
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.320
And I go to one 80% of the time.
Yeah.
Same here.

1134
01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:58.630
The other 20% of the time.
So if she says where you want to go,

1135
01:14:58.631 --> 01:15:02.140
I'm here to say that my restaurant,
we're going to Ragland's in ob.

1136
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:06.460
But that makes it harder though,
right?
Wait,
does she like Ragland's though?

1137
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:08.290
She does.
She does and it makes it easier,

1138
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:13.291
easier but and if she doesn't feel like it then she'll be like,

1139
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:17.860
I don't really want to go there.
Okay,
cool.
Now it's on you.
I gave you my vote.

1140
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.940
Right?
You don't want to do that,
but I think you still got to do it.

1141
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:24.250
You still gotta make a decision.
You got to like,

1142
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:28.390
cause in a way I'm in the same boat as your second scenario there.

1143
01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:29.380
Like if she's not in there,

1144
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:33.400
so then I'm just going to name my secondary restaurant.
Alright,
there you go.

1145
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.470
Just maybe she'll say yes.
Maybe she'll say no.

1146
01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:38.240
<v 3>Wow.
That gotta be my default now though.</v>

1147
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.660
<v 5>Step up and lead.
You know what it,
you know what I've gotta do?</v>

1148
01:15:42.661 --> 01:15:45.230
I've got to prepare.
I've got to prepare myself.
Well,
yeah,

1149
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.440
I got to have like five options just ready to go on deck.
That's what I have.

1150
01:15:49.441 --> 01:15:54.390
Three slope.
So that's not what you want to and they all come in the same order.

1151
01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.330
I must be really boring.
Hey,
you focus on what's important.
That's good.

1152
01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.910
Well,
whenever my wife says,
uh,
you know,

1153
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:06.870
well don't you ever want to try anything new?
I said,
nope.
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't.

1154
01:16:06.871 --> 01:16:08.190
Yeah.
Speaking of which Darlin

1155
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:12.040
you're my girl and I'm looking to try anything new on me.

1156
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:15.270
I'm happy with what happened,
man.
The same thing.
Very happy.
Yes.

1157
01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.250
That's actually that.
I'm going to use that later there,

1158
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.830
but what do you do when the team wants to try something new?
All right,

1159
01:16:22.831 --> 01:16:24.240
let's rock and roll,
right?
Let's do that.

1160
01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:29.250
<v 3>Good tips.
All right,
next question,
Jocko.</v>

1161
01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:31.860
I'm a sergeant in my cow countries army.

1162
01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:35.850
The reason that I'm sending you this message is because of a tragic incident in

1163
01:16:35.851 --> 01:16:39.960
our unit this week.
A young enlisted soldier committed suicide.

1164
01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:44.940
He shot himself with his issue rifle.
This came as a shock to all of us.

1165
01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:49.500
He was a bright,
smart and happy guy.
Damn,
I'm seeking your advice.
Jacqueline,

1166
01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:53.850
do you have any advice on how I as a leader can talk to the guys about it?

1167
01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:59.420
How does a group of soldier soldiers cope with a loss when the reason is so

1168
01:16:59.791 --> 01:17:01.500
tragic?
Thank you.

1169
01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:07.900
<v 5>In obviously condolences to</v>

1170
01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:10.283
<v 3>the team,</v>

1171
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.500
<v 4>the and the family of the soldier.</v>

1172
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:18.270
And I think what you have to do in this situation,
as you got up as a leader,

1173
01:17:18.271 --> 01:17:19.470
you got to bring this out in the open.

1174
01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:22.620
I to think of one of the worst things you can do is pretend that it didn't

1175
01:17:22.621 --> 01:17:24.750
happen.
Pretend that the problem's going to go away.

1176
01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.410
And I think what you have to do is you have to explain it,

1177
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.860
which is weird because in this case explaining,

1178
01:17:31.861 --> 01:17:36.861
it means admitting that you can't explain it because you can't explain it or

1179
01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:38.580
you're not going to be able to,

1180
01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.980
are you going to be making up something that you're guessing at it?
Right?

1181
01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.140
You're not going to know what individual,

1182
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.210
what individual situations caused this to happen.

1183
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:53.780
You know,
cause who can make sense of that?
I mean a bright,
smart,

1184
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:58.520
happy guy.
It doesn't make sense.
And,

1185
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.690
and,
and wow,

1186
01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:04.230
you can't explain why you,

1187
01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:07.350
I think you have to address it as a reality.

1188
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1189
01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:12.630
<v 4>And I think you've got to address it as something that you're pulled tuned,</v>

1190
01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.840
needs to fight against.
Just like they would fight against the enemy.

1191
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:20.990
What is the threat?
The threat is depression.
The threat is loneliness.

1192
01:18:20.991 --> 01:18:22.940
The threat is helplessness.

1193
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:26.360
The thread is feeling like there's no way out.

1194
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:33.930
And being aware of those threats is what allows recognition of the enemy is so

1195
01:18:37.471 --> 01:18:38.790
that you can fight him.

1196
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:44.380
So I think you've got to talk about this with your guys.

1197
01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:49.410
I think that they will become aware of what they need to look out for in others

1198
01:18:49.841 --> 01:18:50.890
and in themselves

1199
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:57.740
so they can alert the platoon that you know,
John,
Hey,

1200
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:59.780
have you guys talked to Johnny man?
He seems,
you know,

1201
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:02.690
Johnny seems a little off right now.
We should check in on them.

1202
01:19:02.691 --> 01:19:06.350
We should talk to him.
Or self recognition,
man.

1203
01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:10.370
I'm feeling like depressed about something.
I'm feeling dark.
It doesn't,

1204
01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.480
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1205
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:15.890
Right in on that last podcast that we did,

1206
01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:22.180
I read a couple excerpts in words from some various combat veterans and I

1207
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:30.761
touched on the fact that several of them from different times from different

1208
01:19:30.921 --> 01:19:33.950
wars had written the same thing.

1209
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:38.760
And they wrote basically that death would be liberating.
Hmm.

1210
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:44.790
And that it would be an escape from the hell of war,

1211
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:48.440
from the memories of war.
And,
and I should have hit on that harder.

1212
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:50.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1213
01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.083
<v 4>Because</v>

1214
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:57.000
I think that what that means to me,

1215
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:59.510
what that tells me is that

1216
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:06.500
is that having those thoughts doesn't necessarily,

1217
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.330
that there's something wrong with you.
Right.

1218
01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:13.710
It doesn't necessarily mean that you're losing it.
These,

1219
01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:16.110
you know,
the,
the writings that I'm talking about,

1220
01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.270
the book and then the writing from a guy that I knew,

1221
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:20.820
it doesn't mean that you're losing it.

1222
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.290
And I think that people think to themselves,
oh,
I'm,
I'm,

1223
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.070
I'm thinking about how death would be an easier way right now and [inaudible].

1224
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:34.290
And they think that by thinking that they're,
they're totally screwed up.

1225
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:38.580
When I think the realities that is on,

1226
01:20:38.581 --> 01:20:43.581
I even think the reality of the situation is that that's obviously a fairly

1227
01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:50.520
normal thing to think about.
And you know,
I,

1228
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:57.410
when I was in Ramadi,
I definitely,
I wasn't thinking about killing myself,

1229
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:02.450
but I definitely saw that dying in combat was,

1230
01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:05.730
would be a relief to the stress that I was under.
No doubt.

1231
01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:10.830
And I didn't want to die.
But I'll tell you what,
we joked about it.
I joked about,

1232
01:21:10.831 --> 01:21:14.160
I joked about it with life.
I'd be like,
Hey,
if we get in a firefight tonight,

1233
01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:17.100
first thing we do is crack a green chemist on my chest so the enemy knows

1234
01:21:17.101 --> 01:21:21.150
exactly where I am.
It's like we're joking because we're under a lot of stress.

1235
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:24.570
But I think my,

1236
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.280
what I'm trying to say is that those feelings or those thoughts don't mean net.

1237
01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.740
You're done.
They just mean that you're human.

1238
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.053
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1239
01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:37.720
<v 4>They just mean that you're human.
And I think if you keep them bottled up,</v>

1240
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.970
then they might explode.
So that's what I think you need to do.
I,

1241
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:45.190
that's what I need to tell your men,

1242
01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:49.330
that these thoughts happen and that your pull tune,

1243
01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.850
your team needs to be on guard against them.

1244
01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:57.460
And the best way to be on guard is to be vigilant,
to look for the signs,

1245
01:21:57.461 --> 01:22:01.030
to look for behavior and talk about them,

1246
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:03.370
and then be able to ask for help.

1247
01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:07.150
That's one of the big problems is guys don't want to ask for help because we're

1248
01:22:07.151 --> 01:22:12.010
macho.
I don't need help with anything.
We are,
our egos are too big,

1249
01:22:12.011 --> 01:22:13.000
so we don't ask for help.

1250
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:14.123
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1251
01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:20.710
<v 4>And so we have to put our egos in check.
We got to pay attention to each other.</v>

1252
01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.220
And there's to be some people that you're going to have to pry this out of them.

1253
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:26.350
Right.
They're not going to willingly talk about it.

1254
01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:30.730
So I think that's what you have to do so that you can get somebody to some

1255
01:22:30.731 --> 01:22:34.210
professional help.
I'm not a psychiatrist obviously.
And,

1256
01:22:34.211 --> 01:22:38.260
and in a normal infantry platoon,
there's no psychiatrist in there.

1257
01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:40.450
But you need to recognize,

1258
01:22:40.451 --> 01:22:43.330
cause you're the first line of defense and how can you get that to somebody,

1259
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:45.970
to a professional that can help them.

1260
01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.930
And to be honest with you,
this doesn't only apply to soldiers,
right?

1261
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.920
It applies to everyone.

1262
01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.980
Don't let these thoughts fester in your brain.
You got to get 'em out.

1263
01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.460
You've got to put them out in the light,
right?

1264
01:23:01.461 --> 01:23:05.830
You've got to put them out in the light.
So they,
so they dry,

1265
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:09.460
they're like a vampire.
They dry up and they wither and they,

1266
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:13.980
they turned to dust.
Hmm.
You know,

1267
01:23:13.981 --> 01:23:14.621
that's what you want to do.

1268
01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:17.100
You're gonna expose him so you can get the professional help and get things

1269
01:23:17.101 --> 01:23:20.010
under control.
So that's the leadership.

1270
01:23:20.011 --> 01:23:23.160
Be Straight forward with your troops.
Tell them the truth.

1271
01:23:23.161 --> 01:23:25.230
Explained the enemy threat.

1272
01:23:25.231 --> 01:23:29.010
That's what we're talking about and how you as a platoon are going to look out

1273
01:23:29.011 --> 01:23:29.844
for it.

1274
01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:34.430
And then obviously you've got to grieve the loss.

1275
01:23:34.431 --> 01:23:39.431
You've got to mourn your fallen comrade and then you also have to get back to

1276
01:23:39.711 --> 01:23:41.450
work,
get back to soldiering,

1277
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.960
get back to preparing for the enemy that you will face on the battlefield with,

1278
01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:56.850
with a new awareness that there's a nother enemy that can lurk inside the

1279
01:24:01.311 --> 01:24:05.810
platoon and inside the individual and that you have to protect each other just

1280
01:24:05.811 --> 01:24:10.280
like you protect each other from a real enemy.
So that would probably be the,

1281
01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:14.660
the route that I would go.
Good luck brother.
With that.
This,
uh,

1282
01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:20.190
it's a hard one for sure.
Next question,

1283
01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:26.580
<v 3>Jocko.
My leader is not an extreme ownership disciple.</v>

1284
01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:30.360
Among other things.
He's fostering division within our team.

1285
01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:35.130
How do I help lead those who no longer trust in the commander but are awesome

1286
01:24:35.131 --> 01:24:37.260
guys want to stay involved?

1287
01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:43.830
How do I bring them back into the fold without threatening our lead or our dear

1288
01:24:43.831 --> 01:24:44.664
leader?

1289
01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.130
<v 4>All right,
well first of all,</v>

1290
01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:49.860
you gotta become a buffer between your boss and your team.

1291
01:24:50.190 --> 01:24:52.560
That's what you need to do.
Um,

1292
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.750
try and absorb as much negativity as you can and make sure you don't spread that

1293
01:24:57.751 --> 01:25:00.630
negativity,
right?
This also,

1294
01:25:00.631 --> 01:25:03.930
this is a delicate situation that we've talked about before.

1295
01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:08.230
If you completely support the boss
and,
and,

1296
01:25:08.231 --> 01:25:10.810
and act like the boss is the greatest person in the world,

1297
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:13.930
the team is going to reject you or does it like a high likelihood that they're

1298
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:18.460
going to reject you.
At the same time,
if you completely reject the boss,

1299
01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:24.210
then you've actually aided in dividing the team because now the team is not

1300
01:25:24.401 --> 01:25:27.640
aligned with the boss.
So you have to balance,

1301
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.520
you have to balance this and one of the best ways to do this is to put listen to

1302
01:25:32.521 --> 01:25:37.420
us.
You got to pull the importance of the mission and the team above the egos and

1303
01:25:37.421 --> 01:25:41.030
attitudes.
So here's,

1304
01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.450
I'm going to say something like,
look guys,
look guys,

1305
01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.600
I know we have our differences with the chain of command on some things,

1306
01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:49.690
but we have a job to do.
All right.

1307
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:53.840
We have a mission to accomplish and even though we might not agree with the boss

1308
01:25:53.841 --> 01:25:55.730
on everything,
it's our team.

1309
01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:01.960
It's our team and the performance of the team.
Sure.
It reflects the boss,

1310
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.730
but reflects us too.

1311
01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:06.993
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1312
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.320
<v 4>So what I say we do is a win.
Let's,</v>

1313
01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.490
let's win.

1314
01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:17.730
Let's be the best regardless of what the boss does or what the boss says,

1315
01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:22.690
let's win.
To prove.

1316
01:26:23.890 --> 01:26:24.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1317
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:29.030
<v 4>To prove that even with a situation where the leadership might be lacking a bit,</v>

1318
01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:33.440
we're so good that we're going to win anyways.

1319
01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:39.830
Who wants to get some of that right?
Yep.
There you go.
Let's win.

1320
01:26:39.831 --> 01:26:42.060
Despite poor leadership.
That's what we're going to do.
Anything.

1321
01:26:42.090 --> 01:26:45.380
I'll tell you what,
in my younger and maybe a little less

1322
01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.410
politically savvy days,
I would've said something like,

1323
01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:55.550
let's win.
Not just despite our leadership,

1324
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.500
but let's win to spite or the or ship.

1325
01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:03.700
Like we would just perform so well in the face of a horrible leader and we're

1326
01:27:04.521 --> 01:27:08.630
going to show everyone what was that?
The underdog Cinderella story.

1327
01:27:08.631 --> 01:27:12.200
We're going to rock.
So that's cool.
You know,
sometimes you're,

1328
01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:16.430
you're winning not just despite your leadership,
but to spite them.

1329
01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:19.420
I'm done that a couple of times in my career.
Not,
not the best,

1330
01:27:19.421 --> 01:27:22.100
if not the best one.
It's better to win despite them.

1331
01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:26.330
So despite we got some rough leadership,
it's okay.
And the other thing is,

1332
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:29.720
you know,
you,
even when you're doing that with a bad leader,

1333
01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.150
you still got to be careful about stepping on the leader's toes.

1334
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.420
And the way you do that,
it's really easy.
You give him all the credit,

1335
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.490
you give them all the credit and that's great.

1336
01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:40.790
And that little nagging voice that you've got in the back of your head that

1337
01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:44.030
wants credit and you know that one I'm talking about that you go back there,

1338
01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.730
don't worry about that.
I'm telling you right now,

1339
01:27:46.731 --> 01:27:49.580
you will get the credit in the long run.

1340
01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.780
You will get the credit.
Don't worry about it.

1341
01:27:53.781 --> 01:27:57.320
You might not get the credit on this one,
or even this week,
this month,

1342
01:27:57.321 --> 01:27:58.880
maybe not even this year.

1343
01:27:58.881 --> 01:28:03.881
But eventually you will get the credit and recognition that you deserve that you

1344
01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:07.340
want because your boss's boss.

1345
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:08.780
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1346
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.613
<v 4>he knows what's up.</v>

1347
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:14.720
He knows what's up and your troops know what's up.

1348
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:16.240
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1349
01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.230
<v 4>And so when everybody knows what's up,
when you have a truly bad leader,</v>

1350
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:22.570
the truly bad leader doesn't,
they're hot.

1351
01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.560
They're not just walking around fooling everyone in an organization.

1352
01:28:26.561 --> 01:28:30.310
It's not happening.
It's not happening.
And if it does happen,

1353
01:28:30.311 --> 01:28:34.120
it doesn't happen for a long.
Yeah,
it only happens.

1354
01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:37.270
There's a limited time that it can happen for,
because every,

1355
01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.500
every idiotic move that that leader makes down the chain of command,

1356
01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.140
at least one out of every five,

1357
01:28:44.141 --> 01:28:46.040
he does something stupid up the chain of command to.

1358
01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:50.110
And so how was that the group performance?
Oh,
well,
we know it's not the leader.

1359
01:28:50.111 --> 01:28:54.160
He's a,
he's an idiot.
Oh,
they must have some good junior leadership in there.

1360
01:28:54.161 --> 01:28:56.200
Who's those guys?
Oh,
that's Echo Charles.

1361
01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.990
He's in charge of that squad and they're crushing it.

1362
01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:02.490
So don't worry about that.
Just lead

1363
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:06.720
<v 5>in when and give that credit away and it's going to come back to you tenfold.</v>

1364
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:11.960
That's what she do kind of in a way goes back to like people are watching,

1365
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:15.140
they're watching for sure.
Yeah.
You are a leader.
He's a poor leader.

1366
01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:16.800
People are going to pick up on that.
Yeah.

1367
01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.940
<v 4>And the [inaudible] do you know that doesn't mean that the boss's boss is going</v>

1368
01:29:19.941 --> 01:29:23.080
to advertise that because the Boston,
Boston,
there are a good leader.
Yeah.

1369
01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.150
So the Boston,
Boston,
you would come to undermine them.
Yeah.
No,

1370
01:29:26.151 --> 01:29:28.700
but when the time comes from emotion and when the time comes for a

1371
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.140
reorganization,
that's what it's going to be happy.
You know?
That's where the,

1372
01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.940
that's where the adjustments are going to be made.
Yeah.

1373
01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:37.873
<v 2>Good point.</v>

1374
01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:39.860
<v 4>But we get so wrapped up,</v>

1375
01:29:39.861 --> 01:29:44.780
we get the ego gets yet ego gets you kind of watch out for that thing.

1376
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:46.263
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1377
01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.580
<v 5>Yeah.
To truly let it go.</v>

1378
01:29:48.581 --> 01:29:52.330
When you don't get the credit and you for real think that you deserve the credit

1379
01:29:52.331 --> 01:29:55.270
to truly let it go.
There's the challenge.
Yeah.
That's a challenging one.

1380
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:59.770
Relish in that challenge.
A laugh at it.
Yeah.

1381
01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:04.510
Do you know good boss?
You did awesome.
Good job.
Yeah,
because I,

1382
01:30:04.570 --> 01:30:08.410
well I feel like anyway when that does happen,
you know when something,

1383
01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.740
and it's not even necessarily someone else gets the credit for what you did,

1384
01:30:11.741 --> 01:30:16.741
it's just that like something big happen and it just went completely unnoticed

1385
01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:21.760
that,
that it was straight up because of you.
Right.
That's a potential scenario.

1386
01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.280
But let's say you,
you don't say anything.

1387
01:30:24.970 --> 01:30:29.170
I think that there is a small feeling of satisfaction that you're like,
you know,

1388
01:30:29.171 --> 01:30:32.380
you took the higher road and saying,
you know,
please get that for them.

1389
01:30:32.381 --> 01:30:36.280
Maybe that's my ego.
Yeah.
Well look at me over here.
I'm not even saying anything.

1390
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:39.730
I'm giving away so much credit.
I'm the man that's like the perfect of money.

1391
01:30:39.731 --> 01:30:42.190
Ego or perfectly directed ego.

1392
01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:47.200
But cause usually it's eclipsed by the fact that you didn't get your credit.

1393
01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:52.060
Yeah.
Usually.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
It's hard.
We all want the credit.

1394
01:30:52.090 --> 01:30:52.923
Got To work on that

1395
01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.130
<v 2>check.
Next question.</v>

1396
01:30:57.850 --> 01:31:00.050
<v 5>I have a question about the warrior mentality.</v>

1397
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:05.310
I recently was dumped on a deployment and it's difficult now that I'm home state

1398
01:31:05.311 --> 01:31:09.920
side.
How does a warrior handle this?
Is it like any other emotional loss?

1399
01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:13.670
I'm trying to use this loss and get after it and improve myself mentally and

1400
01:31:13.671 --> 01:31:17.600
physically.
Not sure how to properly submit questions to a podcast.

1401
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:23.670
<v 4>All right,
so the dear John Letter,
the old classic dear John Letter.</v>

1402
01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:28.290
Hey,
and you know,
agree.
Sometimes you can keep it at bay when you're deployed,

1403
01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.870
but then when you get home and you get back to the places,

1404
01:31:30.871 --> 01:31:34.980
the familiar places where you have the mess specific memories,

1405
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:39.690
that's,
that's where the pain starts to come in.

1406
01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:45.240
And that's fine.
You know,
that's,
that hurts.
That's,
we get that.
Um,

1407
01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:48.390
but in my opinion,
I've said this before,

1408
01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:52.080
the person that you built in your mind,

1409
01:31:52.890 --> 01:31:55.260
the person that you had a relationship with,
that you built in your mind,

1410
01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:01.450
that person doesn't actually exist.
They're not real.

1411
01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:05.920
They're not real.
She wasn't who she appeared to be.

1412
01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:11.860
And she isn't who she appeared to be.
She isn't the sweet understanding,

1413
01:32:11.861 --> 01:32:16.180
fun person that you cared so much about.
That's not her.
That's your memory.

1414
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:17.770
That's what you built in your head.

1415
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:22.950
She is actually the selfish self centered person that cares about herself first

1416
01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:28.090
and doesn't care about you.
That's the reality.
Yeah,
and that's fine.

1417
01:32:29.190 --> 01:32:29.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1418
01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:33.750
<v 4>But a lot of times the pain that we feel isn't based off the reality.</v>

1419
01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.360
It's based on the fantasy.

1420
01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:39.300
So you're feeling pain of losing something that wasn't real.

1421
01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:42.780
So let the fantasy go.

1422
01:32:42.781 --> 01:32:47.781
Remember that she is not the perfect person that you built in your mind,

1423
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:50.340
period.
She's not.

1424
01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.610
Otherwise we wouldn't be in this situation right now.

1425
01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:55.503
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1426
01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:57.520
<v 4>And then move on,</v>

1427
01:32:57.590 --> 01:33:01.480
brother you had after and work out.

1428
01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:05.590
Train hard,
go digit you hike,
run up,
play guitar.

1429
01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:08.950
Just get after it.
And those things.

1430
01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.520
Not only are you going to distract you from the pain,
which is good,

1431
01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.890
they're going to improve you as a human being,
which is good.

1432
01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:17.170
And they're gonna rebuild your confidence,
which is good.

1433
01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:19.000
They're going to make you feel good.

1434
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:24.120
They're going to make you stronger and smarter and better and puts you into a

1435
01:33:24.671 --> 01:33:28.570
place where you don't need that little made up fantasy anymore.

1436
01:33:30.690 --> 01:33:31.460
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1437
01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:34.280
<v 4>and they're going to put you in a place where you can find somebody better than</v>

1438
01:33:34.281 --> 01:33:38.450
the fantasy.
Now,
I'm going to tell you right now,
the fantasies don't exist.

1439
01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:44.740
The perfect girl or guy for you doesn't exist.

1440
01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.353
They don't exist.

1441
01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:53.580
So you're going to be out looking for someone that's good,

1442
01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.430
but you're not going to find perfect.
Don't get obsessed with finding perfect.

1443
01:33:56.970 --> 01:34:00.810
If you find someone that's perfect,
it's not true.
Everyone's got their flaws.

1444
01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.480
So
that's what you have to do.
And,

1445
01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:11.690
and you will end up finding someone that's real and,
and I get it,
man.

1446
01:34:11.691 --> 01:34:14.600
I know you're going to have some moments

1447
01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.880
down in the hole as Alison chains put it or trapped in the heart shaped box as

1448
01:34:26.491 --> 01:34:30.380
nirvana put it.
Sure.
Or so lonesome.

1449
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:34.500
You could cry as Hank Williams Sr put it,
does it.

1450
01:34:34.501 --> 01:34:37.410
You notice a theme here.
This is what people go through,

1451
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:42.430
but those feelings,
they're temporary.

1452
01:34:42.431 --> 01:34:44.770
So let him say hi,

1453
01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:49.300
let them hang around for a minute or for half an hour or an hour or whenever and

1454
01:34:49.301 --> 01:34:51.580
then kick them out,
kick those feelings out,

1455
01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:53.800
get them out of there and go do something else.

1456
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:54.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1457
01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.880
<v 4>Did take your mind away from those memories of fantasies and put,</v>

1458
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:03.650
build some good memories that are real then yeah.
You know what?

1459
01:35:03.651 --> 01:35:07.970
You can use your anger and your frustration to fuel positivity.
For sure.

1460
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:12.980
I spent much of my youth doing that very thing for sure.

1461
01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:17.900
All those break ups.
Yeah.
I turn those things into,

1462
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:22.940
into fuel.
And the other thing I'm telling you is if,

1463
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:24.140
if you take action with your body,

1464
01:35:24.141 --> 01:35:29.141
your mind is going to fall and pretty soon you'll be onto the next chapter and

1465
01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:34.271
you can move beyond this bad fantasy chapter that you kind of got roped into.

1466
01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:41.240
Man.
She can curls man,
he get you every time if you let them.

1467
01:35:41.410 --> 01:35:45.650
It's so hard to,
I mean with the so many times,
you know,

1468
01:35:45.651 --> 01:35:49.550
cause when I was a assistant between commander platoon commander tasks and

1469
01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.170
granted we're not,
we're not what I was doing.
Right.

1470
01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:55.300
But more in the earlier phases.
Right.
Cause then once I was,
you know,

1471
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:58.190
a task unit commander I was dealing with a lot less.
Those,

1472
01:35:58.191 --> 01:36:01.580
those problems that would come to me on a relationship level would be something

1473
01:36:01.581 --> 01:36:05.960
big.
You know,
divorce,
a custody of children,

1474
01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.750
some kind of domestic violence scenario,
like real things.

1475
01:36:08.751 --> 01:36:13.010
But when I was younger and I was in a seal platoon,

1476
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:16.520
that's when you're dealing with guys going through the breakup with a girl and

1477
01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:20.570
the,
you know,
the method method with my head.
Yeah.
It's messing with my head man.

1478
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:25.700
Yeah,
of course.
Every guy goes through that.
Me,
you ever.
That's the way it is.

1479
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:31.030
You get that weird thing kicking around in there and you'd start getting crazy.

1480
01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:37.040
And what's so funny is what's so funny is when you're on the outside of it,

1481
01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:40.580
it's like when you're in the heart shaped box yourself,

1482
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:43.190
you just can't see anything else.
It's just a devastating,

1483
01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.200
and everyone that's looking at you as like,
Bro,

1484
01:36:45.201 --> 01:36:48.590
let's just go to the bar tonight and you'll meet 17 new girls tonight,

1485
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:53.090
but I've like a bag.
I love that lag.
Or that was most special goal?
No,
it's not.

1486
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:56.210
I remember I kind of had,
this is kind of evil,

1487
01:36:56.211 --> 01:37:01.190
but I had a kind of a standard response to guys when they'd say,

1488
01:37:01.191 --> 01:37:05.780
you know,
hey,
you know,
I broke up with Jennifer last night.

1489
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:10.130
I mean off sweet man,
let's,
let's roll.
I would always,
and I even carried that,

1490
01:37:10.131 --> 01:37:12.950
honestly,
this is like not something I don't think I would do anymore,

1491
01:37:12.951 --> 01:37:15.740
but even when guys who would be like,
hey man,

1492
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:20.110
me and Jennifer are getting divorced,
I'd be like,
oh,
right on,
bro.
You know,

1493
01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:25.080
I kind of,
and part of it was just to kind of spin it like,
guys,
man,
not the,

1494
01:37:25.690 --> 01:37:29.810
you need to,
you know,
you don't just wallow in it,
right?
You're getting divorced.

1495
01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:32.990
Okay,
here's what you need to do.
Here's how you maneuver.
But let let you know,

1496
01:37:32.991 --> 01:37:33.740
what are you going to do?

1497
01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:37.540
You're going to get dragged down by that into that Meyer,
or you're going to be,

1498
01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:41.690
you know,
salvage what you can have your life and let's move on.

1499
01:37:41.691 --> 01:37:46.580
Let's rock and roll.
Yeah.
So that's,
again,
it might be a little harsh.

1500
01:37:46.581 --> 01:37:49.520
I don't know that I would still have that react maybe with maybe fall still in

1501
01:37:49.521 --> 01:37:52.940
the Jews,
you know,

1502
01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:57.510
in most and 99 I had one guy that,
that that in,

1503
01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.470
I probably said that too.
We have a high divorce rate in the seal teams.

1504
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.410
It's like an 85 90% divorce rate.

1505
01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:07.050
So I've said this to quite a few individuals over there.
Here,

1506
01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:12.120
I only had one that ever kind of,
you know,
was was like,

1507
01:38:12.121 --> 01:38:15.120
no man,
you don't get it.
And then I said,
no,
actually I do get it.

1508
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.400
You don't get it.
Yeah.

1509
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.730
And it always is a little rougher when there's kids involved and all that.

1510
01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.240
So that would put another little horrible spin on it.

1511
01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:29.780
But the bottom line is that is a good attitude to have hae broke up with my

1512
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:31.140
girl.
Right on.

1513
01:38:31.710 --> 01:38:36.360
I'm glad I got out of this relationship before it developed into something where

1514
01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:40.920
I did have hooks in me,
financial hooks,

1515
01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:45.610
she old Drin,
all those things.
I made it out Scot free,
you know?
Oh,

1516
01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:50.580
I'm getting divorced.
Oh you have any kids?
No.
Okay.
Rock and roll.
You got kids,

1517
01:38:50.581 --> 01:38:54.750
okay,
well how's it going to go?
You know,
what are you put in line?
You know,

1518
01:38:54.751 --> 01:38:58.380
so definitely hard.
Here's a question.

1519
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:04.190
Have you ever gotten your heartbroken and negative and you haven't a straight up

1520
01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.510
EVNA of course I was.
I was a boy.
Boys get their heartbroken.

1521
01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:12.960
Oh you know,
10 11

1522
01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:19.950
one ish time cause you don't,

1523
01:39:19.951 --> 01:39:24.951
when you're 10 it's like okay 1514 1713 I mean I think once I was,

1524
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:30.450
once I was in the seal teams,
I kind of had that coping mechanism when you have,

1525
01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:33.720
because in the two years now we've got to be hard and the girls are like,

1526
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:37.080
you know,
you gotta you gotta just kind of,

1527
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:43.800
but the other y'all,
that's,
you know,
the younger days for sure,

1528
01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.950
every guy goes through that.
And that's what,
that's what's hard.

1529
01:39:46.951 --> 01:39:50.730
And you know what I'm saying guys specifically,
but the girls are the same way.

1530
01:39:50.731 --> 01:39:55.500
Both guys and girls go through these horrible breakups.
And,

1531
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:58.590
and,
and this is the other thing that we got to realize as parents,

1532
01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:03.900
when you're 16 years old,
we,
you know,
I look at my 1516,

1533
01:40:03.901 --> 01:40:08.850
17 year old daughters,
right?
As they were growing up and,
and I think,
oh,

1534
01:40:08.851 --> 01:40:12.580
they got a boyfriend,
whatever he'll be,

1535
01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:15.750
this guy is meaningless in their lives.

1536
01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:20.780
I factually know that these guys are meaningless in terms of the broad spectrum

1537
01:40:22.501 --> 01:40:24.660
of their life.
Yeah.
But guess what,

1538
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:28.710
when you're 15 years old and you've got a boyfriend that is your whole life.

1539
01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:32.910
And so when something goes sideways,
I had to say,
oh,

1540
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.480
I do remember that myself.
When I saw my daughter's distraught over something,

1541
01:40:36.481 --> 01:40:39.180
I'd say,
okay,
here's what's going on,
but this is her whole life.

1542
01:40:39.181 --> 01:40:42.330
And I tried to explain to him,
this guy,

1543
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:46.260
I understand that you like him and that he was good and blah,
blah,
blah.

1544
01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:51.150
But you know,
let's remember you're only 15 and they're,
you know,

1545
01:40:51.151 --> 01:40:54.910
you're going to meet another nice guy and there'll be other opportunities and

1546
01:40:54.911 --> 01:40:58.390
blah,
blah,
blah.
But the,
of course it barely,
barely gets through to their head.

1547
01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.830
They can't even imagine.
I was different.
I know because he's the bat.

1548
01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:08.710
No.
Yeah.
And so,
yeah.
Dang Bro,

1549
01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.000
you're,
you're on that question restriction from now on.
No Bro.

1550
01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:16.000
I want him to know,
I think we all wanted to know.

1551
01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:20.770
Next question
Jocko.

1552
01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:26.560
What's your take on false motivation versus authentic leadership?

1553
01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:33.580
Okay.
Falls motivations versus authentic leadership.
Now there's two kind of

1554
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.440
two kind of ways of understanding this question.

1555
01:41:38.441 --> 01:41:41.830
The first is from like a really heavy leadership perspective and that is of

1556
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:45.460
trying to lead without actually believing in what you're doing.

1557
01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:51.810
And that's leading without understanding why and not believing in what you're

1558
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:56.560
doing.
And that's wrong.
Right?
And this is an extreme ownership of course.

1559
01:41:56.561 --> 01:41:57.910
And we talk about on the podcast,

1560
01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:00.460
you can't do it if you don't believe in what you're doing.

1561
01:42:00.730 --> 01:42:02.970
Your team's going to see that.
And they won't believe in it either,

1562
01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.130
which means they're not going to go above and beyond to accomplish the mission

1563
01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.180
period.
So you got to believe what you're doing and if you don't believe it,

1564
01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:14.110
then you got to ask the question off the chain of command.
Find out why.

1565
01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.370
Understand why.

1566
01:42:15.371 --> 01:42:18.460
So that you believe in what you're doing and eventually you're going to get the

1567
01:42:18.461 --> 01:42:21.220
answer right.
Eventually you're going to understand

1568
01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:27.190
why you're doing something.
You're going to believe in it,
or you're going to,

1569
01:42:27.191 --> 01:42:29.810
you're going to convince the chain of command that,
well,

1570
01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:32.170
that's not a good method and you need to go a different direction.

1571
01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:37.860
And there might be some rare in extremis case where you actually don't,

1572
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:42.400
you know,
you're,
I'm being told to do something and I don't believe in it.

1573
01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.080
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1574
01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:48.640
<v 4>And I'd say,
no,
I'm not going to do it in,
like Napoleon said,
Napoleon's maxims.</v>

1575
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.300
If you,
you,
you actually have to refuse to do it.

1576
01:42:52.301 --> 01:42:54.730
If you don't believe it's the right thing to do,
then you don't do it.

1577
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:59.410
That should be,
if very inextremist,
because are,
as a leader,

1578
01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:04.560
when we're being asked to do something or told to do something or lead in a

1579
01:43:04.661 --> 01:43:08.960
certain way,
they're,
they're leading us towards victory.
Right.

1580
01:43:08.961 --> 01:43:13.210
Right there leading us towards an aligned victory.
If it's on the battlefield,

1581
01:43:13.211 --> 01:43:14.680
it's winning the war.
If it's in business,

1582
01:43:14.681 --> 01:43:17.290
it's creating profit and creating good product and,

1583
01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:21.640
and growing the business,
right?
Those things are,

1584
01:43:22.410 --> 01:43:24.400
that's what you're trying to do.
So if echo,
if,

1585
01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.030
if I'm the boss and you come to me with a,
with something and say,
Hey,

1586
01:43:28.031 --> 01:43:32.020
I want to do this.
If it's going to make us more profitable,
why would I say no?

1587
01:43:32.650 --> 01:43:35.620
Right?
So we're going to move in that direction.
Um,

1588
01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:39.250
so from a high level,
false motivation doesn't work.

1589
01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:43.990
If you don't believe in something that's not going to work out for you.
Now,

1590
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:45.610
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1591
01:43:45.610 --> 01:43:49.480
<v 4>from a micro level,
from like a front line level and the buds,</v>

1592
01:43:49.481 --> 01:43:50.770
instructors used to joke about this,

1593
01:43:50.771 --> 01:43:54.650
that false met motivation is better than no motivation.
Have you ever heard that?

1594
01:43:54.651 --> 01:43:55.484
Is that a common expression?

1595
01:43:55.670 --> 01:44:00.440
False motivation is better than no motivation and we don't want that to be true,

1596
01:44:00.441 --> 01:44:01.274
right?

1597
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:06.370
Because we want motivation to be this pure golden thing that fuels performance

1598
01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:08.810
button.
The fact of the matter is,

1599
01:44:08.811 --> 01:44:12.080
and of course we talk about all this all the time,
motivation doesn't hold up,

1600
01:44:13.090 --> 01:44:13.640
right?

1601
01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.640
Motivation doesn't know how many motivated people motivated people,

1602
01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:24.180
didn't make it through seal training a ton of them.
They're all motivated you.

1603
01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.720
How many of them didn't make it for training?
Autonomy,

1604
01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:32.200
how many motivated people do you see that don't accomplish their goals that they

1605
01:44:32.541 --> 01:44:36.410
have?
Right?
The world is full full of those people.

1606
01:44:36.411 --> 01:44:37.880
There's a ton of those people

1607
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:42.230
and that's because motivation doesn't hold you up.
We all know this.

1608
01:44:42.231 --> 01:44:45.230
It's disciplined.
That holds you up.
It's discipline that gets things

1609
01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:49.640
going and it's discipline that gets you through things.

1610
01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:56.430
But this is a little interesting little spin if you have the discipline to press

1611
01:44:56.431 --> 01:44:59.700
on,
why not have a little fun with it?
Right?

1612
01:44:59.730 --> 01:45:02.250
And that's where I think false motivation can,

1613
01:45:02.251 --> 01:45:06.660
can come in and you can make sense.
Some things fun.
For instance,
it's cold,

1614
01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:10.830
wet and miserable and we have to go swim over the beach and do an operation.

1615
01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.050
Let's get some,

1616
01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:19.700
or it's a 118 degrees with massive humidity and we have a 14 kilometer patrol to

1617
01:45:21.031 --> 01:45:21.864
get to target.

1618
01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:28.800
Let's get some who Yahoo or the water is 41 degrees and we are about to launch

1619
01:45:31.751 --> 01:45:36.040
on a four hour dive,
right?
Hell yes.

1620
01:45:36.041 --> 01:45:39.370
Let's do this,
right?
That that's false motivation,

1621
01:45:40.690 --> 01:45:44.500
but it's backed up by discipline and it might not be real,

1622
01:45:44.501 --> 01:45:49.501
but it absolutely beats the hell out of this is going to be miserable though.

1623
01:45:49.861 --> 01:45:52.000
I want to do it right.
What would you,

1624
01:45:52.001 --> 01:45:53.890
if you and I were going to go do something that was going to suck,

1625
01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.720
would you rather have me say a echo?
I really don't want to do this.

1626
01:45:58.721 --> 01:46:00.340
Put some disciplines too.
I'm going to do it.

1627
01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.750
Or would you have rather have me say,
echo,
this is going to suck.

1628
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:06.760
Let's go get some right.

1629
01:46:06.761 --> 01:46:11.500
You'd rather have the false motivation strap on the pack and put on the mask and

1630
01:46:11.501 --> 01:46:16.150
fins and fire up the false motivations here after it.
Now,
I will tell you this,

1631
01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.320
I wouldn't even be sarcastic with false motivation.

1632
01:46:20.321 --> 01:46:23.590
I won't even blink an eye accident.
My,
this is the difference.
My my faults.

1633
01:46:23.591 --> 01:46:24.880
Motivation doesn't believe a false.

1634
01:46:24.970 --> 01:46:29.970
I actually believe my own false motivation if it's working and by the time stuff

1635
01:46:30.311 --> 01:46:33.520
came out of my mouth,
I meant it.
I meant it.

1636
01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:37.090
So I don't know at some point in my childhood,

1637
01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:42.360
false motivation turned into like an actual fuel and just just regular

1638
01:46:42.431 --> 01:46:43.210
motivation.

1639
01:46:43.210 --> 01:46:46.780
Maybe it's because I realized that I wasn't counting on it to get me through

1640
01:46:46.781 --> 01:46:50.250
things.
I was just having fun with it.
Rock.
And do

1641
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:52.590
<v 5>you think also how you know how you,</v>

1642
01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:56.780
like you'd always say that you were kind of into just being hardcore,

1643
01:46:56.890 --> 01:47:01.260
even if it's your normal style,
whatever.
So you know,

1644
01:47:01.261 --> 01:47:02.730
when you think back and you're like,
okay,

1645
01:47:02.731 --> 01:47:05.940
I'm going to take the hard route or whatever,
after you finish it,

1646
01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:07.770
you kind of feel more proud of it for sure.

1647
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.270
Like do you think that that played into it?
That is like I can be,
yeah,
for sure.

1648
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:15.090
For sure.
Be More hardcore.
Yeah.
Like I said,

1649
01:47:15.091 --> 01:47:19.680
like the meaning of the meaning of the music hardcore when I was a kid was being

1650
01:47:19.681 --> 01:47:23.370
hardcore and just the actual meaning of the word.
And so yeah,

1651
01:47:23.371 --> 01:47:25.260
it's real easy to go from that to like,
Hey,

1652
01:47:25.261 --> 01:47:27.720
I'm going to do something that's socks and I'm going to have a good time with,

1653
01:47:27.721 --> 01:47:32.490
I'm going to laugh about it.
And that does,
and it is contagious.
So contagious.

1654
01:47:32.491 --> 01:47:36.870
I'm actually not like that now.
And if would you say you're going to like,
no,

1655
01:47:36.871 --> 01:47:40.320
I'm actually like that now.
Oh,
okay.
Not to,
you know,
100%,

1656
01:47:40.321 --> 01:47:45.090
but in a lot of things man,
like my um,
my daughter,
she's four,

1657
01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:49.410
she weighs 45,
47 pounds.

1658
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.120
So I'll be sitting here,
I'll be laying on the couch,
not paying attention.

1659
01:47:54.121 --> 01:47:57.540
She'll climb up on the couch behind and jump in land.
Like,

1660
01:47:57.541 --> 01:48:01.660
you know what a knee drop is,
right?
Atomic knee drop.
Just so you know,

1661
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:06.290
for awhile in my house there was no rules in my house.
No,

1662
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:07.230
actually there was no,

1663
01:48:07.231 --> 01:48:10.170
there was only two rules in my house when my kids were like,

1664
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:15.690
when my older kids were like,
you know,
seven,
six whenever that,

1665
01:48:15.691 --> 01:48:18.210
those types of ages that your daughter out right now.
But a little bit older,

1666
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:22.080
there was two rules in my house.
Number One,
don't touch me when I'm eating.

1667
01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:26.580
Number two,
no atomic knee drops.

1668
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.750
They would do it to each other.
Oh yeah.
I didn't mind them doing it to me,

1669
01:48:30.751 --> 01:48:32.920
but they would atomic knee drop each other.
Yeah.

1670
01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:37.590
So I had to have two rules and plus I wouldn't have a lot of time to eat and all

1671
01:48:37.591 --> 01:48:41.050
of a sudden it's like they want to hold on my arm.
No,
no,
no,
no,

1672
01:48:41.051 --> 01:48:45.750
no word from you want a meeting like a,
like a rabid dog.
And it's funny,

1673
01:48:45.751 --> 01:48:49.140
one of them,
the reason that's fresh in my mind,
cause we were just on a trip and,

1674
01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:53.370
and you know,
my kids were explaining to my youngest daughter that,
well,
you know,

1675
01:48:53.371 --> 01:48:58.371
when we were little dad was meaner and he wouldn't let us touch him when we

1676
01:48:59.061 --> 01:49:03.120
were,
when he was eating.
Like you just did.
And of course I said,

1677
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:06.690
well that's because she's cuter than you,
all of you.

1678
01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:14.160
I ended up,
I don't mind the time it knee drops anymore because of you,

1679
01:49:14.161 --> 01:49:17.700
because of the very reasons like you gotta be hardcore cause like,
okay,

1680
01:49:17.701 --> 01:49:21.150
you've got a four year old kid,
right?
Get how fun that is for her to,

1681
01:49:21.151 --> 01:49:24.280
I talk to the drop here,
which is another reason why I'm like this now.

1682
01:49:24.810 --> 01:49:28.560
So she'll climb on the couch talking to need drop while I'm not ready by the way

1683
01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:32.340
onto my ribs.
So she didn't break my ribs,
she didn't injure me to,

1684
01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:34.590
to any blasting degree.

1685
01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:39.960
But if the normal mindset is like,
why did you jump?
Why did you do that?

1686
01:49:40.170 --> 01:49:44.850
It hurt.
It's face it 45 47 pounds,
top of a couch.

1687
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.030
Tomic need job.
Both of these,
by the way,
all the weight,
you know,

1688
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.990
for the last city,
all that stuff hurt by the normal standard of things.

1689
01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:58.150
So the typical mindset I think would be like,
don't do that,

1690
01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:02.800
especially the shock and all this stuff,
but default is just like whatever.

1691
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:04.960
No factor.
And Yeah,

1692
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:08.800
sure it is a catch 22 cause she will and does and but she thinks it's all fun

1693
01:50:08.801 --> 01:50:10.030
and all this stuff.
But yeah,

1694
01:50:10.031 --> 01:50:12.870
that's that mindset and that came directly from you like Bihar.

1695
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.340
It's like Jocko wouldn't complain about that right there.
Oh,

1696
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:16.390
you want to let that happen.

1697
01:50:16.590 --> 01:50:19.270
It's really embarrassing if you complain to your four year old daughter,

1698
01:50:19.290 --> 01:50:22.930
you've heard anything about anything,
about anything.
I agree.

1699
01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:25.850
That's the setting example you were talking about earlier.
Yeah.

1700
01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:30.360
You complain about anything and you're wrong.
Agree thousand million.

1701
01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:34.060
Just suck it up.
Yeah.
Say bring it on.
Yeah,
false motivation,

1702
01:50:34.061 --> 01:50:39.040
which becomes real motivation,
which for be hardcore,
the only,
like I said,

1703
01:50:39.041 --> 01:50:43.540
the only sort of reason for motivation for me is just funny.

1704
01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.430
Just funny.

1705
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:49.390
It's not going to actually get you to do anything but just let's have fun.

1706
01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:50.380
I'm going to do it anyways.

1707
01:50:50.770 --> 01:50:53.380
I'm going to let the atomic knee drops happen over and over again and I'm going

1708
01:50:53.381 --> 01:50:55.870
to end.
So why?
When I could go through life,

1709
01:50:55.871 --> 01:50:58.390
just experiencing them and accepting them,

1710
01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:01.430
wanting to have some fun with the atomic and he drops in the long cold dives and

1711
01:51:01.431 --> 01:51:06.090
those hot weather and the dehydration and the hypothermia.

1712
01:51:06.130 --> 01:51:09.610
Why not have fun with all those things?
Yeah.
I mean you probably know,

1713
01:51:09.611 --> 01:51:12.690
but it's unbelievable how much that helps you sell.

1714
01:51:12.930 --> 01:51:17.930
You know what I think maybe because my view of motivation is so low.

1715
01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:24.040
Yeah.
That to me it's just funny,
like false motivation,
like just funny.

1716
01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:28.570
Yeah.
And it,
but it is fun.
It's a fun thing.
Yeah,
that's,

1717
01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:31.870
and that's kind of part of what I mean k so that you know the mats,

1718
01:51:31.871 --> 01:51:36.280
I don't know if you noticed,
I brought the Mattson.
Yes I did.
So those mats there,

1719
01:51:36.281 --> 01:51:38.620
I think just like 16 of them,
I forget how many,

1720
01:51:38.621 --> 01:51:41.860
but they cover a two full two car garage covered it perfectly.
It's a lot.

1721
01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:46.660
It's a lot of math and the two inch thick ones.
So to move them up the,

1722
01:51:46.661 --> 01:51:51.630
you know,
the
topography is that even,
so you had,

1723
01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:54.780
so you had like some legit challenge and yeah.

1724
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:57.220
And I'm not even saying that there's not enough here to here.

1725
01:51:57.221 --> 01:52:01.720
This is what happened.
He came in,
put the maths right there,
boom.

1726
01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:04.990
One day,
I don't know,
whenever the other day.
And then um,
you know,

1727
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:08.390
I walked to Jade's office,
my brother,
you know,
he was like,
Oh hey,
what's up?

1728
01:52:08.391 --> 01:52:11.110
What are you doing here?
I was like,
oh just put the mats in there.
He's like,

1729
01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:14.690
you put the mats in here.
What do you do?
You go,

1730
01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:17.080
what did someone help you with that?
I looked at him and I said,

1731
01:52:17.110 --> 01:52:18.850
I don't need help.
Oh,

1732
01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:22.120
but it was a joke cause that's the line from this thing.

1733
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:28.300
But the point there is just that,
that attitude,
you know,
like,
no,

1734
01:52:28.301 --> 01:52:31.360
I don't need help.
No I don't,
you know,
cause I'm trying to be like Jocko,

1735
01:52:31.361 --> 01:52:35.770
you know,
hardcore.
I don't need help.
Little kids can't hurt me.

1736
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:38.500
You can't make me completely,
you know,
it's like that mindset.
But,

1737
01:52:38.501 --> 01:52:41.620
and it said his chair,
you're asserting into a complete savage,

1738
01:52:42.190 --> 01:52:46.100
little kids can't hurt you and you can carry the mass by your own mind,
your own,

1739
01:52:46.101 --> 01:52:48.330
that's another thing.
And this is another little expression that used,

1740
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:52.370
cause my son,
when he could,
before he could talk,
well he would,

1741
01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:56.390
when he would want to do something he'd say,
he'd say,
I do it by my own,

1742
01:52:57.710 --> 01:53:01.090
by myself or on my own.
Yeah.
It makes it say by my,

1743
01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:07.280
so that'd be kids outgrow.
That became a thing.

1744
01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:10.820
Here's a legitimate one that that just changed.

1745
01:53:10.821 --> 01:53:14.870
It changed this specific thing where,
you know how I,
like I'd be the kind of,

1746
01:53:14.871 --> 01:53:17.820
I didn't get enough sleep.
I just let it ruin me mentally.

1747
01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:25.580
So if I didn't have something specific like,
uh,
important to do.

1748
01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.890
So just throughout the day,
oh,
I'm tired,
you know,
whatever.

1749
01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:32.570
So now I never admit that I'm tired.
Yeah.
That's,
that's a good,

1750
01:53:32.571 --> 01:53:36.380
great starting place.
I've used it myself.
I've explained that to my son.
Is,

1751
01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:40.130
is you just don't admit ever that don't want those words come out of your mouth.

1752
01:53:40.131 --> 01:53:43.190
Yeah,
I'm tired.
I'm sore and whatever,
just stop.

1753
01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:45.900
Because when you're getting the teams,
that's just,
that's just,
uh,

1754
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:50.180
putting up a red flag of being a complete pain.
You don't do it.

1755
01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:54.170
Don't do it.
As a matter of fact,
you know,
was jacked up.
It's like I won't even,

1756
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:55.970
let's say you and I were to go out,

1757
01:53:55.971 --> 01:53:59.530
let's say it was wintertime and you and I were to go out and I had a sweatshirt

1758
01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:04.250
with me because I knew it might get cold but we're out already and I have the

1759
01:54:04.251 --> 01:54:07.040
sweatshirt in my hands.
I won't even put it on.

1760
01:54:07.730 --> 01:54:10.820
You can put it off cause then you,
then you might say,

1761
01:54:11.210 --> 01:54:15.900
well are you cold cold?
They need some warmth.
Yeah.

1762
01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:20.230
Dang,
that's a good one.
Yeah,
I'm going to do that too.
Should I say not do know,

1763
01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:23.540
remember that I remember,
I think I told this story before,

1764
01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:28.250
but every time we were joining from la he was like late at night and you're
like,

1765
01:54:28.251 --> 01:54:33.050
yeah,
I know I'm this big bed team guy or whatever,
but I'm kinda tired right now.

1766
01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:37.490
And then almost like you just,
it was painful to let the words out of your mouth,

1767
01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.380
you know,
like you let them slip in.
It really hurt you.

1768
01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:43.700
It was like maybe like three seconds later you said,
fuck it.

1769
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:46.430
I'll just draft a Montana.
If I have to be right now,
I'll just get in the mood.

1770
01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:54.950
I was tired yesterday.
I was driving and my wife says like,
Oh,

1771
01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:58.180
you haven't been sleeping much.
Are you okay to drive?
I was like,
yeah.

1772
01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:03.050
And I actually,
I did the same thing.
I was Kinda like,
well,
I'm super tired.

1773
01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:08.050
I can drive indefinitely.
I don't know though.
The,
I mean you,
I dunno,

1774
01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:12.410
maybe you're different.
Maybe not,
but no,
no.
I don't encourage people doing that.

1775
01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:13.910
Don't encourage it.
That's a,

1776
01:55:13.911 --> 01:55:17.900
that's a horrible thing to do is drive when you're super tired.
Yeah.

1777
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:21.530
Don't do that.
Well,
I'm coy.
It's um,
it's happened to me before,

1778
01:55:21.531 --> 01:55:24.830
but why it's really boring to drive because it's so easy.

1779
01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:29.630
It's just so like you don't,
so when you get like tired or sleepy or whatever,

1780
01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:32.420
it's really easy to just fall asleep.
Super easy.

1781
01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.470
And that's hard because you can't control it.
It's like you think you can just,

1782
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:37.530
I can control it.
In short,

1783
01:55:37.531 --> 01:55:41.240
there is little tactics like you can like let her do little things that you

1784
01:55:41.241 --> 01:55:43.860
don't inflict pain on yourself,
whatever.
But man,

1785
01:55:43.861 --> 01:55:48.390
it's really hard to control once you fall asleep.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

1786
01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:53.240
You wake up in a bridge in bunk,
just dead or wake up dead.

1787
01:55:53.250 --> 01:55:54.750
Yeah,
that's not good.

1788
01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:01.410
I was reading this thing on motivation and it said in this book,

1789
01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:03.150
I'm not saying that this is true or not true,

1790
01:56:03.151 --> 01:56:06.090
but it said it made sense where motivation,

1791
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:09.930
people misuse the word motivation and they confuse it with inspiration.

1792
01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:13.310
Inspiration is like when someone gets you all revved up to do something,
right?

1793
01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:15.150
It's like what you're saying like,
well,
you know,
let's do this.

1794
01:56:15.151 --> 01:56:19.400
Or you see a mansion now you're inspired to work hard for stuff or whatever.

1795
01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:24.050
Listen to some speech,
some quote unquote motivational speech.
It inspires me.

1796
01:56:24.051 --> 01:56:28.140
It doesn't motivate you.
Motivation is your,
your bare raw motive.

1797
01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:32.790
The motive for you doing it.
So let's say,
I feel like I said this before,

1798
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:36.240
but the,
let's say I want to get in shape.
You know,

1799
01:56:36.241 --> 01:56:38.270
girls will get in shape for their wedding.
You know,

1800
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:42.150
that's the motive is to be in shape for the wedding so that doesn't go away.

1801
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:45.520
So she's not necessarily inspired,
meaning she's like,
um,

1802
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:48.450
she got infused with some feeling,
you know,

1803
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:53.210
if you just wouldn't go away,
but it would,
well,
no,

1804
01:56:53.490 --> 01:56:56.470
here's the thing.
The motive is still there is discipline.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1805
01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:57.290
There's a motivation.

1806
01:56:57.290 --> 01:57:00.090
She wakes up at five o'clock in the morning to go get a workout in before she

1807
01:57:00.091 --> 01:57:03.600
goes to work.
The real easy to just be like,
you know what,

1808
01:57:03.601 --> 01:57:07.650
I'm not feeling motivated today.
Right,
right.
Just get the,
get the wedding dress,

1809
01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:10.050
you know,
let out a little bit.

1810
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:13.530
But that just means that the motive motivation,

1811
01:57:13.531 --> 01:57:18.531
the motive isn't strong enough to overcome her feelings for lack of inspiration.

1812
01:57:18.571 --> 01:57:20.000
I don't rely on it.
Yeah.

1813
01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:22.530
You're not going to find a motivation that's strong enough to make you do the

1814
01:57:22.531 --> 01:57:25.070
things that you have to do all the time.
You don't,
you can't,
doesn't exist.

1815
01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:28.500
It kind of,
well,
it depends.
It just depends.
So consider a fighter.
Stop.

1816
01:57:28.501 --> 01:57:32.850
Consider a fighter with a fight he has to make.
Wait.
Yeah,
you're right guys.

1817
01:57:32.851 --> 01:57:35.640
Don't make us wait on time.
That's what I'm saying though.

1818
01:57:35.641 --> 01:57:39.520
The motive and you know,
with that,
you know,
when that motivation failed,

1819
01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:44.280
that motivation failed.
You know,
five weeks ago when they,
when they guys burgers,

1820
01:57:44.281 --> 01:57:47.260
yeah.
They had a five guys burgers.
You're right.
Yeah.

1821
01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:50.400
So the discipline holds the line.
Yeah,
it does.
Totally.

1822
01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:55.080
Now you can have fun with it and you can be motivated to have discipline and you

1823
01:57:55.081 --> 01:57:59.820
can say,
Oh,
like a pee Robin from origin geese.

1824
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:04.740
I was up with him in Maine and he's like,
got a bet to lose weight.

1825
01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:07.980
And he hit me with some false motivation because we were out,

1826
01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:10.660
we were out and you know,
we were ordering,

1827
01:58:10.670 --> 01:58:15.640
I was ordered a big steak and just getting after the Grub.
Sure.
And I said,
like,

1828
01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:17.420
how many more pounds do you have?
You know,
we're talking about,
and I was like,

1829
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:19.170
it was kind of sock can sit here.
He's like,
no,

1830
01:58:19.230 --> 01:58:21.240
I actually enjoy watching you eat delicious food.

1831
01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:26.820
You go to false motivation coming at you,
but in a funny way.
Yeah.

1832
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:30.540
And instead of letting it out like that instead of being just miserable,

1833
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:34.950
why not just have some fun with it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's great advice.
Yeah,
fully.

1834
01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:38.450
But then the difference though,
like I said,
I agree.
You're right.

1835
01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:42.670
I mean that's the point I was maybe making was uh,

1836
01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:47.770
was just the technical difference between motivation and inspiration.
You know,

1837
01:58:49.110 --> 01:58:49.943
hey,

1838
01:58:49.950 --> 01:58:54.950
you know you to know this stuff because both those words just flimsy.

1839
01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:01.120
They're weak words and their week ended and the actual subjects are weak

1840
01:59:02.230 --> 01:59:07.110
inspiration.
All right.
It's not going to get you there.
Come on.

1841
01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:11.590
It might get you through like the first three minutes of,
of,
you know,

1842
01:59:11.591 --> 01:59:13.060
you and I were just talking before you came in here.

1843
01:59:13.210 --> 01:59:18.100
You said there was moments in your workout today when you could have easily or

1844
01:59:18.101 --> 01:59:20.860
yesterday you could have easily called it like,
hey man,
I'm sweating.

1845
01:59:20.861 --> 01:59:24.850
I got a good workout.
But didn't you held the line?
Yes.
Discipline,

1846
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:30.100
discipline.
It was actually I created false.
Just truth be told,
you're right.

1847
01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:35.110
But I've created false motivation for myself.
I just say,
you know what,

1848
01:59:35.111 --> 01:59:37.090
I'm going to,
I'm going to do this.
Actually,

1849
01:59:37.091 --> 01:59:40.690
it's the way for me to facilitate discipline for myself is I want to do this

1850
01:59:40.691 --> 01:59:43.480
cause I'm going to feel better afterwards.
You know,

1851
01:59:43.481 --> 01:59:44.770
that whole deal talking about discipline,

1852
01:59:44.771 --> 01:59:49.771
then you contrast it with how junk I'm going to feel if I don't weak embarrassed

1853
01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:52.950
for myself by the way.
And when I said that,
um,

1854
01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:56.200
you know how workout has many opportunities to stop.
So one,

1855
01:59:56.201 --> 02:00:00.070
the first opportunity is in the parking lot.
In this case I went to a gym.
So Bro,

1856
02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:02.320
if you walk away when you're in the parking lot,
you got to issue.

1857
02:00:02.321 --> 02:00:03.310
So I've done that.

1858
02:00:03.311 --> 02:00:06.040
I've done that like four times in my life to admit that on the podcast you

1859
02:00:06.041 --> 02:00:10.930
should just lie.
Boy,
it makes this current story.

1860
02:00:11.090 --> 02:00:14.290
Okay,
mercy again.
So boom,
that's the first opportunity.

1861
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:16.420
Second opportunities before you warm up,

1862
02:00:16.810 --> 02:00:20.950
which is pretty close to the first opportunity before you won't ever quit then

1863
02:00:21.010 --> 02:00:24.030
yes.
Oh my God.
Jeez.

1864
02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:27.700
One time it felt real good cause they justified it,
but very effectively.

1865
02:00:27.701 --> 02:00:30.310
And the second time I was like,
I just gotta get after it tomorrow,
whatever.

1866
02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.750
Nonetheless then,
then it's after the first body part d or the first sort of,

1867
02:00:34.751 --> 02:00:37.180
you know,
you have,
I'm going to do,
you know,
metcon first.

1868
02:00:37.181 --> 02:00:38.670
I'm going to do spots first.
So,
you know,

1869
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.550
it's after the first exercise body part.

1870
02:00:42.551 --> 02:00:47.140
Really that's one opportunity.
To me the biggest hurdle is getting there,
which,

1871
02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:49.930
which is when you have your gym in your house,
that's that turtles gone.

1872
02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:55.080
I agree that it gets easier to hold the line for sure after you start,

1873
02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:56.530
but there's a part at the end,

1874
02:00:56.531 --> 02:00:59.340
you know how like how you just said you'd like to do your,
uh,

1875
02:00:59.450 --> 02:01:01.420
Macron the afterwards.
No,

1876
02:01:01.421 --> 02:01:05.580
lately I've been doing metcon before and lifting heavy African,
right?
Yeah,

1877
02:01:05.590 --> 02:01:07.780
that's what I meant.
But you're right,
I could say,

1878
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:10.420
you know what that meant come was a little bit heavier.
It was hard.

1879
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:14.630
Just call it good on that day.
A heavy part.
Yeah,
exactly right.
But man,

1880
02:01:14.631 --> 02:01:18.640
I feel so good when I'm all loosened up.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1881
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:20.740
So same deal with me and they,
uh,

1882
02:01:21.190 --> 02:01:24.880
every opportunity to quit was passed.

1883
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:26.950
Was wave well done.
Echo Charlie,

1884
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:33.880
last question here.
You got time for one more.
Yes,
Jocko.

1885
02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:36.580
I am a chronic excuse maker.

1886
02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.130
How do I stop making excuses and

1887
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:41.360
<v 4>get things done?</v>

1888
02:01:45.010 --> 02:01:48.250
The chronic excuse maker,

1889
02:01:48.730 --> 02:01:53.530
how do you stop making excuses?
This is actually pretty simple.

1890
02:01:54.650 --> 02:01:58.120
Yeah,
and I said it the other day and you have to realize,
you have to know.

1891
02:01:58.570 --> 02:01:59.160
You have to,

1892
02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:04.160
except that all your excuses are lies.

1893
02:02:06.250 --> 02:02:07.480
They are lies.
All of them.

1894
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:13.510
Think about the things that you tell yourself,

1895
02:02:13.511 --> 02:02:17.200
the lies you use to rationalize.
Taking the easy road,

1896
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:24.190
taking the easy road and leaving discipline behind.
Think about them.

1897
02:02:27.250 --> 02:02:30.850
You don't have time.
That's a lie.

1898
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.000
You don't have support.

1899
02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.800
That's a lie.

1900
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:42.450
You don't have the equipment or the gear.

1901
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:44.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1902
02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:48.180
<v 4>Lies.
You don't.
You don't know the best way.</v>

1903
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:50.820
Who Cares?
That's a lie.

1904
02:02:51.150 --> 02:02:54.300
Or you're too old or you're too young.

1905
02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:57.240
Of course you're too old or too young,
lie

1906
02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:02.850
and there's,
you're too busy.

1907
02:03:02.970 --> 02:03:07.850
Sure you are.
That's a lie.

1908
02:03:09.590 --> 02:03:14.590
And you're too tired or you're too sore or you're just plain not feeling it.

1909
02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.020
Lies,
lies,
lies.

1910
02:03:19.090 --> 02:03:19.650
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1911
02:03:19.650 --> 02:03:23.880
<v 4>And the list goes on and on and on.</v>

1912
02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:30.580
And it doesn't stop.
If you don't make it,
stop.

1913
02:03:32.370 --> 02:03:34.440
So recognize,

1914
02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:37.760
recognize

1915
02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:43.490
the excuses are not valid.
They aren't.

1916
02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:48.940
They're trumped up there,
conjured up.

1917
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.520
They're fabricated,
they're lies.

1918
02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:55.810
And how do you stop the lies?
You Stop the lies with the truth,

1919
02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:01.970
the truth,
the truth will set you free.

1920
02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:08.680
The truth will stand and the truth will deliver you from Procrastination and

1921
02:04:11.721 --> 02:04:16.721
laziness and the downward spiral that comes with a lack of discipline.

1922
02:04:21.150 --> 02:04:24.480
So don't believe the lies,
believe the truth.

1923
02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:28.290
And the truth is you have time.
You have the skill,

1924
02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:33.440
you have the knowledge and the support and the willpower and the discipline to

1925
02:04:34.711 --> 02:04:35.730
get it done.

1926
02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:42.900
<v 3>So cast out the lies,</v>

1927
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:46.230
burn them down

1928
02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:50.960
and listen to the truth.

1929
02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:56.370
They live the truth and go out and get it done.

1930
02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:07.470
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1931
02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:13.380
So Echo.
Yeah,
speaking of the truth.
Sure.

1932
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:18.830
Could you perhaps explain to us how to support this podcast if we want to,

1933
02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:23.330
if we want to be sure.
Yeah.

1934
02:05:24.090 --> 02:05:27.580
What you can do is support yourself.
[inaudible]

1935
02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:33.520
I think I made this analogy before,
you know,
in the aircraft,
right?
Pre takeoff.

1936
02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:38.580
We go through the safety instructions in event of cabin pressure loss.

1937
02:05:38.610 --> 02:05:43.380
Yeah,
oxygen mask comes down,
put it on yourself,
be free and all that.

1938
02:05:43.381 --> 02:05:44.880
I mean that's a good kind of thing.

1939
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:48.180
Where are you support yourself then you can help support others.

1940
02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:53.190
So support yourself.
This is how we supplementation like it,
and again,

1941
02:05:53.191 --> 02:05:57.000
I'll say this again,
I'll say it every day.
If I,
if I am compelled,

1942
02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:01.260
if I'm motivated to inspired too.
Either way,

1943
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:05.820
I'm now into supplements,
not a bunch,

1944
02:06:05.850 --> 02:06:10.650
but before I was like no supplements,
you just get good nutrition anyway.

1945
02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:15.870
So krill oil and I think this is a daily thing by the way.

1946
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:18.750
And I think you can maybe relate,

1947
02:06:19.530 --> 02:06:22.830
I think daily on how happy I am that I take Krill oil,

1948
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:26.610
but I don't like thank my lucky stars,
nothing like that.

1949
02:06:26.611 --> 02:06:30.840
I'm just saying there are daily things that it's on my mind that I'm like this

1950
02:06:30.841 --> 02:06:34.380
experience would be different if I didn't not take Krill oil straight up.

1951
02:06:34.590 --> 02:06:37.190
That is true.
So I got it.

1952
02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:42.330
So I backed my car into the garage loading mats,

1953
02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:46.500
the,
Oh yeah,
that,
that was another time.
But this was more recently.

1954
02:06:46.501 --> 02:06:47.600
So it's getting filling,
you know what,

1955
02:06:47.601 --> 02:06:50.970
you fill up the five gallon things a water.
Yeah.
And I talk about that.

1956
02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:54.210
So I'm putting it like you got to maneuver it because I sit in the garage,

1957
02:06:54.211 --> 02:06:54.961
I should've pulled out.

1958
02:06:54.961 --> 02:06:59.961
But whatever the new hardcore man be times on maneuver ain't got to take it out.

1959
02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:03.600
And I don't want to,
you know,
so you,
it's hard to explain,

1960
02:07:03.601 --> 02:07:08.460
but you don't when you're on base,
whenever,
whenever it's true,

1961
02:07:08.461 --> 02:07:10.950
it's apple.
It's applicable everyday life.

1962
02:07:11.150 --> 02:07:15.510
The krill oil isn't just for deep squats,
heavy [inaudible].

1963
02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:20.210
It's for taking five gallons of water in a jug out of tight spaces where you've

1964
02:07:20.211 --> 02:07:22.010
got to kind of twist,
you know?
Yeah.

1965
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:24.990
Cause you don't want the car door to hit like the other car door got dented.

1966
02:07:24.991 --> 02:07:28.380
Good time to have the Krill oil in you.
Yeah,
man.
And,
and really that's,

1967
02:07:28.710 --> 02:07:32.520
well that's part of the payoff is what big part is the everyday things.

1968
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:35.260
It's true.
For sure.
Yeah.

1969
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:38.980
There'd be times where I'd be sitting down a long time and I stand up and I'm

1970
02:07:38.981 --> 02:07:43.420
surprised on how little pain I feel.
Pain,

1971
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:44.730
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
But you,

1972
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:46.960
you ever been like that where you think like,
yes,

1973
02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:49.100
I'm going to feel like all this,
this is going to be stiffer.

1974
02:07:49.110 --> 02:07:52.000
This is going to be heard of what an end.
It's just simply not.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1975
02:07:52.001 --> 02:07:54.070
yeah.
Dot.
Okay.
That part is real.

1976
02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.240
So get your Krill oil in the event of you,
even wine and Krill oil.

1977
02:07:58.241 --> 02:08:01.270
These are my experiences.
Obviously.
Jock was this walkers.

1978
02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:04.290
You take Krill oil as well.
Indeed.
Um,

1979
02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:08.110
get them from audit on it.com/jocko if you want the 10% off.

1980
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:11.530
Also the Alpha brain.
So the crude oil,
that's like,

1981
02:08:11.590 --> 02:08:13.060
I don't think that'll ever go away.
No.

1982
02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:15.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1983
02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:17.750
<v 3>The Alpha brain,
I am using a lot more.</v>

1984
02:08:18.850 --> 02:08:19.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1985
02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.700
<v 3>Murray,
the more to coincidence,
maybe,</v>

1986
02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:24.220
maybe not one might be causing the other correlation.

1987
02:08:24.221 --> 02:08:26.860
May Not be causation,

1988
02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:29.230
but I'm just saying that is happening.

1989
02:08:30.610 --> 02:08:33.850
And I will admit this.
As far as workouts go,

1990
02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:38.090
I'm getting real into the kettlebells.
You've always been into the Kennel.
Yes.

1991
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:42.700
Yeah.
Not always,
but no.
15 years you been in the game?

1992
02:08:43.190 --> 02:08:47.800
I would say like
maybe 10 years or something.

1993
02:08:47.801 --> 02:08:50.770
12 years.
Yeah.
Okay.
Maybe it has been 15 years.
Yeah.

1994
02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:52.900
Cause I just remember that picture Joe Rogan,

1995
02:08:52.901 --> 02:08:56.040
I think Joe Rogan and I were talking about the picture of Fado fader.
Yeah.

1996
02:08:56.050 --> 02:09:00.610
Look that up right when you guys were talking about with the pictures.
Oh,
okay,

1997
02:09:00.670 --> 02:09:05.430
cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Kind of hard to get them back then though.
Yeah.
Well yeah,

1998
02:09:05.431 --> 02:09:05.780
it's a,

1999
02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:09.570
I think it was your room and saying how like somebody introduced him to America

2000
02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:12.690
and that's,
that's where,
that's from.
Rushing guy.
Yeah,
man,
they're,

2001
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:16.990
they're really good.
Um,
again,
being careful every single moment,

2002
02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:19.210
but I'm to the point right now where like,
you know,

2003
02:09:19.211 --> 02:09:22.420
you get kind of good and it gets even fun or like anything.
And then I'm like,
Oh,

2004
02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:25.030
let me get that heavier one.
Now let me get the heavier one.

2005
02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:29.110
But I will say this about the kettle bells,
about my experience.

2006
02:09:29.111 --> 02:09:31.910
I started off the kettlebells getting the these designer ones,

2007
02:09:32.770 --> 02:09:37.330
primal bells on it.
Zombie Bells Brag.

2008
02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:38.490
Actually I didn't get the Zombie.

2009
02:09:38.491 --> 02:09:43.420
I got primal and then the legend Werewolf once.
Anyway,

2010
02:09:43.450 --> 02:09:46.750
they're cool,
right?
Cool to look at.
So you know who I'm Kinda like,

2011
02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:51.250
I dunno how you should be proud of this or ashamed of this,
but I'm like the kid,

2012
02:09:51.251 --> 02:09:51.461
you know,

2013
02:09:51.461 --> 02:09:54.640
the teenager who gets their driver's license and there's two types of kids.

2014
02:09:54.970 --> 02:09:57.370
There's the one kid who the dad's like,
hey,

2015
02:09:57.910 --> 02:10:00.910
you got to learn to walk before you can fly.
So you got it.
Like,

2016
02:10:00.990 --> 02:10:03.220
I dunno all make the down payment.
You make the payments.

2017
02:10:03.221 --> 02:10:06.070
That's what my dad used to say.
Or You make the down payment or whatever.

2018
02:10:06.071 --> 02:10:09.130
You know,
like you've got to work for this first car and it might not be the,

2019
02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:11.110
you know,
the BMW,
whatever.

2020
02:10:12.130 --> 02:10:16.420
Then there's the other kid who rolls right into the BMW,
you know,
hey,
good job.

2021
02:10:16.421 --> 02:10:21.340
You're 50 now,
big,
big,
big time of your life,
time in your life,
whatever.

2022
02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.600
Yeah,
here's a dope car.
Congratulations.
Love you son.
You know?

2023
02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:29.230
Then there's that guy that's kind of who I am with the kettle bells.
You know,

2024
02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:30.790
I didn't like pay my dues.

2025
02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:33.260
You know when the kettle bells were new and all the straight to

2026
02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:39.920
<v 5>the dope where off.
Anyway,</v>

2027
02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:43.780
a lot of cool stuff on there,
on the web,
on it.com.
A lot of cool stuff on there.

2028
02:10:43.890 --> 02:10:46.380
Um,
all legit stuff.
That's I think the,

2029
02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.660
the real compelling thing for me anyway because I know if he's supplements men,

2030
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:55.190
I've heard of people getting their supplements and then you know,

2031
02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:58.820
the supplement was like contaminated with something and then they say,
oh yeah,

2032
02:10:58.821 --> 02:11:01.610
they just mix all the supplements and the same thing in the fat.

2033
02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.330
It's like it can be really whack nonetheless on it.

2034
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:09.200
That's the good ones.
Quality.
Say Hi.

2035
02:11:09.201 --> 02:11:13.550
If you want 10% off on it.com/jocko strong bones would go into for your tenants.

2036
02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:17.420
In my experience.
Also Amazon.

2037
02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:22.430
So where do we get these books?
Sure.
We didn't do books today,
but we do what,

2038
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:26.690
what,
66% of the time would you say you do books?
Yeah,
maybe more.

2039
02:11:26.690 --> 02:11:29.540
Sometimes more than one role.
I,
yeah.
Last time we did three bucks,
three bucks,

2040
02:11:29.541 --> 02:11:32.990
boom.
All on the website,
by the way.
Yup.
So anyway,
if you,

2041
02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:35.930
this is another support yourself situation.
A lot of time people ask,
Hey,

2042
02:11:35.970 --> 02:11:37.940
you know,
which book was that again?
You know,

2043
02:11:37.941 --> 02:11:40.790
and they've got to go backward and don't last for me for a reading list.
Hey,

2044
02:11:40.791 --> 02:11:42.320
do you have some kind of reading lists?
I'm like,
yes.

2045
02:11:42.321 --> 02:11:46.450
I got a reading lessons on [inaudible],
podcast.com every book that I end,

2046
02:11:46.530 --> 02:11:48.860
and by the way,
are there books that are,

2047
02:11:48.861 --> 02:11:51.980
they're good books that you've read that day you haven't put on the podcast?

2048
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:55.320
Not really.
When I read a book and it's good,
it's going on the podcast.
Yeah.

2049
02:11:56.060 --> 02:11:58.850
If I read a book and it's lame,
it's not going on the podcast.
Now,

2050
02:11:58.851 --> 02:12:02.420
there's some books that are informational,
but they don't cut it for the podcast.

2051
02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:06.710
Yeah.
I wouldn't recommend them.
I'll tell you a little,
a little.

2052
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:08.270
I just realized this.

2053
02:12:08.271 --> 02:12:13.271
I had a book selected for the podcast like three weeks ago and I got a hundred

2054
02:12:14.211 --> 02:12:15.044
pages into it.

2055
02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:17.750
They didn't cut the mustard for the podcast and I'll tell you though,

2056
02:12:18.110 --> 02:12:21.260
one of the major reasons for those of you that recommend me books a lot,

2057
02:12:21.650 --> 02:12:25.760
one of the major reasons that it didn't cut the mustard for the podcast is not

2058
02:12:25.761 --> 02:12:30.761
only was it not a first person account but it didn't even have like a lot of

2059
02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:36.260
excerpts of first person accounts.
It was just factually this is what happened,

2060
02:12:36.261 --> 02:12:38.350
this is what happened,
this is what happened is very well detailed.

2061
02:12:38.351 --> 02:12:42.800
It was a good book but it wasn't podcast cause if you,
if you want to do that,

2062
02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:48.110
if we're just going to read facts,
dates,
facts,
elements,
maneuvering,

2063
02:12:49.070 --> 02:12:53.840
that's that's,
you could just listen to the audio book,
right?
Yeah.

2064
02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:57.800
Whore or just go look on Wikipedia and it's going to tell you the dates and

2065
02:12:57.801 --> 02:13:00.470
times and where the units maneuvered and who won the battle and how many people

2066
02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.400
casualties.
They were,
right.
All that stuff's in there.
We don't want just that.

2067
02:13:04.401 --> 02:13:05.960
I want to hear what the people were thinking.

2068
02:13:05.961 --> 02:13:07.910
I want to hear that from the human beings.
Yup.

2069
02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:11.750
So even though there's people send me books,
if you're going to send me a book,

2070
02:13:11.751 --> 02:13:14.510
look for the first person account.
If it's not a first person account,

2071
02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.180
like machete season,
that's not a first person account,
but it,

2072
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:22.190
it interviews the killers.
So you're hearing the first person accounts and man.

2073
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:27.320
Yup.
And that reading list.
So that reading links reading list is pretty,

2074
02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.130
pretty well vetted.
Then like straight up,
if it doesn't pass the Jocko

2075
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.140
<v 3>approval of recommendation,
it's not going,</v>

2076
02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:36.330
it's not going on the podcast not going on this topic.

2077
02:13:36.331 --> 02:13:38.010
And therefore consequently,
no,

2078
02:13:38.070 --> 02:13:40.980
I'd rather not do a podcast and put a lane book on the podcast.

2079
02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:43.380
It's not happening.
Boom.
And that's the standard right there.

2080
02:13:43.381 --> 02:13:47.340
So Jocko podcast.com top menu,

2081
02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.430
little thing says books from the podcast.
All of them.
Yup.

2082
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:56.790
And what I'm kind of starting to do is like,
you know how I,

2083
02:13:56.820 --> 02:13:58.830
like I mentioned that book of mine is called Mind Games.

2084
02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.950
Just a small little book.
I think you put it on there.
Yeah.
Somebody,

2085
02:14:02.010 --> 02:14:04.110
somebody tweeted,
I didn't know you put it on there.
Yeah.

2086
02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.670
So I'll put that kind of,
if you're,

2087
02:14:05.690 --> 02:14:08.570
if we mentioned a cool book and let's say you,
for what,

2088
02:14:08.590 --> 02:14:11.130
let's say it doesn't fit or you didn't get to it or whatever,

2089
02:14:11.131 --> 02:14:15.090
but there's some sort of a,
for lack of a better term,
buzz going around it,

2090
02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:17.940
he'll put it on there.
Nonetheless.

2091
02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:21.600
Point there is get the books from their click through there.

2092
02:14:21.630 --> 02:14:25.000
That's a good way to support small actions.
Big Reaction.
And if you're just go,

2093
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:27.480
we're just gonna shop for duct tape and other,
you know,

2094
02:14:27.481 --> 02:14:31.680
stuff that you mean to do that too?
Like feeling website it up.
Double support.

2095
02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:35.130
Double support.
Yes.
Dang.
Still one action.

2096
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2097
02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.020
<v 3>One big reaction.
You understand what I'm saying?</v>

2098
02:14:39.650 --> 02:14:44.000
Also subscribe to the podcast on Itunes,
stitcher,

2099
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:48.290
Google play and other podcast providing platforms.

2100
02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:52.310
Oh,
that's a good way to support of course.
And also youtube.

2101
02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:54.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2102
02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:58.400
<v 3>Put some excerpts on there when?
Yesterday.
Today.
Yeah.
Yesterday.</v>

2103
02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.430
So those are even,
and I knew this before,

2104
02:15:01.431 --> 02:15:03.710
but those are getting more and more in my opinion,

2105
02:15:04.490 --> 02:15:07.820
significantly valuable because even I,
you know,

2106
02:15:07.821 --> 02:15:10.760
I don't memorize every word of every podcast,

2107
02:15:11.210 --> 02:15:14.720
but when I go through and I kind of look at it and you know,
and then,
you know,

2108
02:15:14.721 --> 02:15:16.790
I listened to it,
listen to the three minutes or whatever.

2109
02:15:16.791 --> 02:15:18.170
It's like a good little reminder.

2110
02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:20.300
It's like a refresher and that's not to mention,

2111
02:15:20.301 --> 02:15:23.140
let's see if I totally forgot it,
you know?
Yeah.

2112
02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:27.920
Like oh and not to mention if you hear it and you go,
that reminds me of bill.

2113
02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:32.420
He's having that issue,
going to send it over to bill,
no problem.
Shareable.
Yep.

2114
02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:36.500
And he's going to,
he's going to probably watch it as opposed to,
hey bill,
here's,

2115
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:39.930
here's the,
the podcast I was talking about with your issue.
It's hey,

2116
02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:43.760
three hours and 27 minutes long.
Get Som,
you're right.

2117
02:15:43.761 --> 02:15:48.500
Bill might not listen to that quite yet.
And he might get around to,
it.

2118
02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:51.650
Might not,
not if he's in a hurry,
not if he has a busy life.

2119
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:56.640
Still might find a way.
Anyway,
but there are shareable and there quicker.

2120
02:15:56.641 --> 02:15:58.350
So when you click on it,
you can listen to them.

2121
02:15:58.351 --> 02:16:03.351
They're excerpts including those and also other videos I'm gonna put on there.

2122
02:16:03.991 --> 02:16:06.870
But you know,
we're working on those.
So yeah,
youtube subscribe,

2123
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:10.260
get some as they say.
Also,
Jack was a store.

2124
02:16:11.470 --> 02:16:16.300
It's called Jocko store Jocko store.com.
That's the website.
It's an online store.

2125
02:16:16.330 --> 02:16:19.510
It's a good one.
Just did a little revamping of it.
Little bit,

2126
02:16:19.930 --> 02:16:21.520
little bit more user friendly.

2127
02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:27.100
Not that it wasn't user friendly before,
but you know,
you can,
I don't know,

2128
02:16:27.370 --> 02:16:31.390
I think it's a little cleaner or whatever.
Um,
but you know,
nonetheless,

2129
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:34.150
the shirts are still available there.
If you like the shirts.

2130
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:37.330
He liked the designs.
Get some,

2131
02:16:37.331 --> 02:16:41.710
I'm not saying hey guys,
support by buying shirts.
I'm not saying that.

2132
02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:46.990
Not saying that at all.
I'm saying go to the website Jocko,
store.com.

2133
02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:52.060
Check them out if you like them.
Get them support that way.

2134
02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:56.530
That's how also some travel travel mugs on there.
Some bumper stickers,

2135
02:16:58.550 --> 02:17:02.130
<v 0>this hoodies.
But should we be wearing hoodies right now?</v>

2136
02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:07.380
Well we shouldn't here.
Yeah,
we live in California,
southern California.

2137
02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:12.950
Some people live in cold places where Alaska.

2138
02:17:13.350 --> 02:17:17.370
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,
that's true.
Our Way.
Yeah,

2139
02:17:17.970 --> 02:17:18.803
that's true.

2140
02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:21.740
<v 3>Also rash guards on there though.</v>

2141
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:26.960
So is it too soon to have another rash guard?
It's too soon.
Huh?

2142
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:29.990
I don't really necessarily think so.
Yeah,

2143
02:17:29.991 --> 02:17:33.920
I actually think more rash guards is better.
Is Better.
The more the better.
Yeah.

2144
02:17:34.550 --> 02:17:38.570
Well Hey,
we got two out so there's,
you know,
rash guards on there as well.

2145
02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:41.870
Some women's stuff and um,
yeah,
if you want to support that way,

2146
02:17:41.930 --> 02:17:43.700
get yourself a garment.

2147
02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:48.390
<v 0>There's a sick rash guard.
The CIC rash guard from,</v>

2148
02:17:48.610 --> 02:17:49.240
like I said,

2149
02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:54.130
I've been hanging out a little bit with a guy named Pete Roberts from origin

2150
02:17:54.131 --> 02:17:58.240
gies up in Maine.
Yeah,
my home of record for the military by the way,

2151
02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:01.480
in New England and he made a,

2152
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:05.770
he made a rash guard like a special 4th of July Day rash guard.

2153
02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:10.150
And I'm going to go ahead and say affirmative.
It's out of control.

2154
02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:16.930
You've got to check it out.
It is George Washington

2155
02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:23.470
wearing a [inaudible]
riding a snake,

2156
02:18:23.590 --> 02:18:28.270
a giant snake.
The don't tread on me snake.
So it's,

2157
02:18:28.330 --> 02:18:31.570
I don't know if he's gonna make a lot of them,
but if you don't have one,

2158
02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:34.660
I think we all should basically have fun.

2159
02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:38.680
Origin main.com you can get one of those.

2160
02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:42.520
Origin origin main m a.
I.
N.
E.
Yeah.

2161
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:45.370
Origin main.com and what you know,

2162
02:18:45.371 --> 02:18:48.160
where you know where they're made once you guess where they're made?

2163
02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:52.900
Well you figure mean no,
you figure,
oh well he's,
if he's,

2164
02:18:52.901 --> 02:18:56.650
if he's getting a rash guard,
they're probably made in China.
Maybe.

2165
02:18:56.740 --> 02:19:01.000
Or maybe they're made in Pakistan maybe.
Or maybe they're made in Taiwan,

2166
02:19:01.630 --> 02:19:05.950
but there's also a whole bunch of places that make them like Sri Lanka and

2167
02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:07.750
Vietnam and Thailand.
Maybe they're made there.

2168
02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:09.850
You'd be wrong on every single one of those.

2169
02:19:09.851 --> 02:19:14.320
Cause you know where they're made America.
They're made in Maine.

2170
02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:17.680
Yeah.
So you met want to order one,

2171
02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:22.210
but do they source like the material every frank,
it's from May.

2172
02:19:22.211 --> 02:19:27.160
It's from America.
Pete's crazy Pete.
He doesn't play around,

2173
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:28.460
especially

2174
02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:30.660
<v 5>woven.
He's woven as an eat.</v>

2175
02:19:31.050 --> 02:19:36.050
He weaves his own material for geese to make these with.

2176
02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:42.330
Yeah,
that's straight on me.
That's straight up.
That's this.
This made Mary,

2177
02:19:42.350 --> 02:19:44.510
the cotton comes from little South Carolina or something,

2178
02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:48.630
shipped up to Maine looms.
Do you know what to leave?

2179
02:19:48.650 --> 02:19:52.480
Know to Loomis fruit of the loom.
So it's like here,

2180
02:19:52.690 --> 02:19:56.840
here's Holly put it together ultimately.
So alumut makes,
uh,

2181
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:58.580
you know we've stuff right?
Yeah.
It's a little,

2182
02:19:58.581 --> 02:20:01.790
it's a basically a big weaving machine.
I mean there's more to it than that.

2183
02:20:01.791 --> 02:20:05.210
Of course.
So now remember the brand fruit of the loom?
Yeah.
Oh,

2184
02:20:05.211 --> 02:20:08.670
I guess like there's fruit,
fruit of the loom.
Well,

2185
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:15.130
origin actually has their own looms once again here in Maine in your hometown

2186
02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:21.630
layers,
bro.
Anyways,
check those out.
Yeah.

2187
02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:25.370
Then you'll,
you'll be to say you'll be fired up.

2188
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:28.070
I'm going gonna go ahead and say you will be inspired.

2189
02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:31.520
And it's funny too because the,
uh,
the rash guard design,

2190
02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:36.470
the American 4th of July rash guard design,
it's,

2191
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:40.730
you know,
things can get so over the top that they actually become cool.

2192
02:20:40.850 --> 02:20:45.020
Yeah.
I think that's where it's at.
That's where it's at.
And like me,

2193
02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:49.340
I'm all about the subtle designs.
Right.
You know,
what should we do?

2194
02:20:49.450 --> 02:20:52.430
Make it black and then don't put much on it.
That to me,

2195
02:20:52.700 --> 02:20:56.630
he was took the other direction.
I'm going to have a giant snake.

2196
02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:00.200
I'm going to have George Washington with a black belt on.
It ain't an origin.
Gee,

2197
02:21:00.201 --> 02:21:03.950
I'm going to have,
you know,
that's what I'm talking about America.

2198
02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:07.430
That's kind of like uncle.

2199
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:10.730
Why when you go to the north shore and you can go north,
north,

2200
02:21:10.731 --> 02:21:13.900
north or you can go west,
west,
west and you go too far.
Cause quite,

2201
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:18.110
it's like a circle.
Before you know it,
you're essentially at the same place.

2202
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:23.690
Well,
yeah,
yeah.
I see.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2203
02:21:23.691 --> 02:21:26.330
At first I wasn't following you.
Yes you do get to the same place.

2204
02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:28.790
He went to crazy.
He went to Korea.

2205
02:21:28.791 --> 02:21:32.570
But he went so far in the world in the realm of crazy that it became dope.

2206
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:36.110
You know,
cause you have like we,
we consider dope.

2207
02:21:36.111 --> 02:21:41.111
It's like the perfect mix of breezy and understated and current contemporary or

2208
02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:43.930
rebellion against.
Yeah.

2209
02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:49.100
But he went in that one direction that you don't really go for mass acceptance.

2210
02:21:49.101 --> 02:21:53.360
And then he took it too far and now it's right into the right where it needs to

2211
02:21:53.361 --> 02:21:56.830
be.
Dope
dopeness go.

2212
02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:03.020
Psychological warfare.
Hey,
here's a question.
Tough question.

2213
02:22:03.021 --> 02:22:07.310
Psychological warfare is this false motivation?

2214
02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:09.650
Wait,
wait,
let me explain what it is.

2215
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:14.710
So psychological warfare is an album with tracks of Jocko sane basically,

2216
02:22:15.921 --> 02:22:20.180
you know,
in moments of weakness on your journey,
whatever,

2217
02:22:20.210 --> 02:22:24.800
waking up early,
sticking to the Diet,
you know,
trying to get stuff done,
you know,

2218
02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.310
anti procrastination stuff.

2219
02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:31.380
<v 3>You can play these tracks and Jack will tell you how to get over that weakness</v>

2220
02:22:31.530 --> 02:22:36.090
for that moment.
So the question is,

2221
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:37.650
is that false motivation,

2222
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:42.360
cause you did mention that you can use the false motivation.
Yeah.

2223
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:45.810
Well maybe you are at that point,
right?
It is possible.

2224
02:22:45.900 --> 02:22:49.560
You just can't depend on it.
You can't be like,
hey this,
this is my little thing.

2225
02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:52.170
<v 4>Yeah,
that's a good point.
It's going to get you there.</v>

2226
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:53.550
But if you're not disciplined yourself,

2227
02:22:53.551 --> 02:22:54.870
those tracks are going to do anything for you,

2228
02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:58.740
<v 3>right?
Yeah,
exactly.
So keep these mice,</v>

2229
02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:02.410
they are pretty good.
They're pretty powerful that it was like a,
I say,

2230
02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:02.960
and I know we got

2231
02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:05.720
<v 4>make psychological warfare to uh,
I,
I've,</v>

2232
02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:10.010
I've gotta continue gather a couple more tracks that I'm thinking about and what

2233
02:23:10.011 --> 02:23:13.760
people been asking for so that they can,
you know,
have a little,

2234
02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:18.590
we'll spot if they need it.
Spot psychologically spot.
Yeah.
So just,

2235
02:23:18.591 --> 02:23:21.810
you know what I was thinking of naming spike psychological warfare to what?

2236
02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:23.510
Psychological warfare,
too

2237
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:30.660
<v 3>advanced events,
but yeah,
that is what it is.
It's a spot.</v>

2238
02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:34.350
So just like false motivation that can be just like a spot.

2239
02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:37.860
Like you can't roll into the gym with your workout partner and be like,
Hey,

2240
02:23:37.861 --> 02:23:40.740
I'm going to get under this bench is four or five on there.

2241
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:44.690
I want you to do the whole thing.
I want you to upright row.
Yeah.
That Ale,

2242
02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:46.650
you know?
Yeah.
You don't,
that's not what a spot for us,

2243
02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:48.570
not what any of these things for it's,

2244
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:53.630
I'm going to do this in the unlikely event that I run into something that may

2245
02:23:55.051 --> 02:23:58.470
cause me to fail.
You got me that rest of the way.
That's it.

2246
02:23:59.130 --> 02:24:01.530
That's what psychological warfare.
He's too by the way.

2247
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:05.430
But in my experience and opinion,
you can lean on that pretty heavily.

2248
02:24:05.530 --> 02:24:06.363
It'll get you through.

2249
02:24:06.450 --> 02:24:11.430
It's my opinion also Jocko white tea on Amazon.

2250
02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:12.540
You can get that there.

2251
02:24:15.610 --> 02:24:19.960
<v 4>And I guess I got asked on Twitter if I ever used any performance enhancing</v>

2252
02:24:19.961 --> 02:24:24.490
drugs,
you know,
and I said no.
But honestly,
let's just go ahead and face it.

2253
02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:29.760
I'm white tea is kind of the King of performance enhancement as far as I've

2254
02:24:31.690 --> 02:24:32.523
seen.

2255
02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:38.400
So obviously it's the only substance on the market that is guaranteed to add

2256
02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:44.500
7,554 pounds to your deadlift.

2257
02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:49.120
So does that performance enhancing?

2258
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:51.730
Luckily it's not being tested for right now.

2259
02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:56.450
You know by the U S D s a s p Usada.

2260
02:24:56.750 --> 02:25:00.760
Yeah,
them.
So right now you can get it.
Yeah,
get it.

2261
02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:05.590
You can just get that massive increase in everything that you do.
That's cool.

2262
02:25:05.591 --> 02:25:10.591
Also weigh the warrior kid and me and so many people have been posting pictures

2263
02:25:14.410 --> 02:25:19.410
of kids doing pull ups and kids pulling tires and kids studying flashcards and

2264
02:25:21.041 --> 02:25:25.600
kids making their own warrior a kid and memorizing the presidents and it's

2265
02:25:28.330 --> 02:25:31.570
honestly,
it's awesome to see kids in their first Jiu Jitsu class.

2266
02:25:31.570 --> 02:25:33.040
It's so good to see.

2267
02:25:33.041 --> 02:25:38.041
So thanks everyone that is posted that and and showing what's going on and

2268
02:25:39.941 --> 02:25:42.910
spreading the word.
Thank you for doing that.

2269
02:25:42.911 --> 02:25:46.090
And if you really actually want to support this podcast,

2270
02:25:46.130 --> 02:25:49.060
don't worry about the podcast,
don't support the podcast,
don't worry about it.

2271
02:25:49.090 --> 02:25:54.090
Go buy this book for some kids that you know because the feedback is just,

2272
02:25:54.611 --> 02:25:55.444
it's awesome.

2273
02:25:55.540 --> 02:26:00.540
It's awesome to see and I can see that is absolutely impacting kids and I just

2274
02:26:03.761 --> 02:26:07.990
couldn't be happier about that.
And if you want to help,

2275
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:09.640
don't worry about me.
Don't worry about echo.

2276
02:26:09.641 --> 02:26:13.450
Charles gets get this book for some kids,

2277
02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:17.650
it's the book we should have had when we were kids.
Get kids on the right path.

2278
02:26:17.890 --> 02:26:20.380
I guess if you really want a sport,
you could,
you could get it through Amazon,

2279
02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:24.760
right through then you'd be good.
Do Devil gravitational.

2280
02:26:26.290 --> 02:26:29.380
Also,
discipline equals freedom field manual.

2281
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:35.200
So many questions that I get asked or answered in the book beyond what I,

2282
02:26:35.201 --> 02:26:38.560
you know,
workouts,
food,
sleep

2283
02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:40.810
plus.

2284
02:26:40.810 --> 02:26:45.810
It's also contains the core of my belief system.

2285
02:26:48.010 --> 02:26:51.970
What keeps me going,
how I overcome setbacks,
everything.

2286
02:26:51.971 --> 02:26:56.110
It's all in there,
and I'll tell you,
it's not a normal book.
This is not normal.

2287
02:26:56.350 --> 02:26:58.090
This is not a normal book in any stretch.

2288
02:26:58.091 --> 02:27:01.180
My publisher says he's never seen him to book anything close to this.

2289
02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:05.350
It's outside the box of anything.
I've never seen anything like it.

2290
02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:07.960
We're going out on a little limb here.

2291
02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:12.730
It's sorta like the podcast because there's not too many pockets.

2292
02:27:12.850 --> 02:27:15.700
There's no podcast that's doing what we're doing is,

2293
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:19.600
I don't know why I haven't heard one.
Not that I know of.
I haven't heard one.

2294
02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:22.360
You know what I mean?
So it's sort of like that.

2295
02:27:23.810 --> 02:27:28.660
We're entering the same zone in my opinion.
There's words there,

2296
02:27:29.770 --> 02:27:34.120
there's pages there.
Yes,
like normal books.
There's patterns there.

2297
02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:39.250
There's layers there and it comes out October 17th so ordered up.

2298
02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:43.720
You can get that first batch.
You weren't the one that says first edition,
right?

2299
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:47.630
Sure.
It's the one you want on the inside cover on.

2300
02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:52.210
It says first printing.
That's the one.
And also,
you know,
get,

2301
02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:56.680
you know your friend that's off the path,
you know?
Yes.
Your friend.
Oh,

2302
02:27:56.681 --> 02:27:59.980
you grew up with this front and they're off the path one for them.

2303
02:28:00.730 --> 02:28:03.840
It's not normal.
Not a normal book.
The one that needs discipline.

2304
02:28:03.860 --> 02:28:07.780
Get them this book.
Also of course,
extreme ownership,

2305
02:28:09.250 --> 02:28:13.870
combat leadership lessons from the battlefield to use in your business and your

2306
02:28:13.871 --> 02:28:18.640
life.
Wherever you're leading,
whoever you're leading.
Extreme ownership,

2307
02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:22.340
you can pick that one up.
Also,
echelon front

2308
02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:26.780
<v 0>leadership and management consulting me,
Leif Babin,
JP Denelle,</v>

2309
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:27.860
Dave Burke.

2310
02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:29.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2311
02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:32.920
<v 0>You want to get your leadership team unified.</v>

2312
02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:34.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2313
02:28:34.890 --> 02:28:38.520
<v 0>Email info@echelonfront.com will come and make it happen.</v>

2314
02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:40.590
And finally the muster.

2315
02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:42.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2316
02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:44.300
<v 0>The first semester that we did in San Diego sold out.</v>

2317
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:48.740
The one we did in New York sold out.
But when we're doing an Austin sold out.

2318
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:53.980
So if you wanted to come to those and you didn't make it,
sorry,
you know,

2319
02:28:55.040 --> 02:29:00.040
but we are back in San Diego September 14th and 15th back at the Omni hotel down

2320
02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:02.960
town.

2321
02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:07.880
Muster zero zero for new material by the way.

2322
02:29:08.660 --> 02:29:13.580
New Material but same attitude,
same passion.
We're going to bring it,

2323
02:29:13.730 --> 02:29:15.200
we're going to burn it down.

2324
02:29:15.470 --> 02:29:19.520
We will see you there and until we do see you there,

2325
02:29:20.570 --> 02:29:23.660
we'll see you on the interwebs on Twitter,

2326
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:29.290
Instagram and Dash Facebooky Baja

2327
02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:36.390
Echo is at echocharles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2328
02:29:36.391 --> 02:29:40.640
Can't thanks once again for listening to those in uniform,

2329
02:29:40.641 --> 02:29:42.680
especially those overseas.

2330
02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:49.240
Thank you for being strong and brave and standing up for what you and we believe

2331
02:29:51.261 --> 02:29:52.094
in.

2332
02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:53.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2333
02:29:53.610 --> 02:29:58.600
<v 0>And also thanks to police,
law enforcement,
firefighters,</v>

2334
02:29:58.620 --> 02:30:01.380
paramedics and other first responders.

2335
02:30:01.440 --> 02:30:05.940
Thanks for keeping us safe here at home and to everyone else out there.

2336
02:30:07.350 --> 02:30:07.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2337
02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:11.870
<v 0>Like First Lieutenant Leonard Isaac asked,</v>

2338
02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:15.360
see how you can help people.

2339
02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:21.740
Ask how you can help them and clean up what's around you.

2340
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:27.350
It never run away from something you're afraid of.

2341
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:30.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2342
02:30:30.510 --> 02:30:33.150
<v 0>And as Doctor Horror Cova told us,</v>

2343
02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:39.460
whether you're at an operating table or a leaf,

2344
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:43.060
or a sewing machine,
or on a construction side,

2345
02:30:43.061 --> 02:30:45.970
or your child's cradle or wherever you're working,

2346
02:30:48.980 --> 02:30:53.750
do your work skillfully,
honestly,
and happily,

2347
02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:56.210
and with your whole being.

2348
02:30:58.710 --> 02:30:59.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2349
02:31:00.020 --> 02:31:03.350
<v 0>Do your best in everything you do.</v>

2350
02:31:03.530 --> 02:31:06.950
And as they both taught us,
remember

2351
02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:12.560
our time here is short.

2352
02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:19.270
So get out there and live,

2353
02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:24.720
and until next time,

2354
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:29.460
this is echo and Jocko out.

2355
02:31:31.210 --> 02:31:31.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>
