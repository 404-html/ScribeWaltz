This is Jocko podcast number 96 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.370
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.960
and we are going to roll right into some Q and a from I'm sure people have the

4
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:17.580
interwebs.
Yes.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.740
Well or not actually of the interwebs there from everyday life through the inner

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.800
is where we receive questions.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah,

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.810
it's been a while right since the Q and a has been a while since Q and I.

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.140
<v 1>That's cool.
All right,</v>

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.360
well first question.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.580
Recently at my job,
we got a new supervisor,

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.300
one who happens to be retired army.
After 20 years.

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.310
He and I had a pretty heavy running two which resulted in getting HR involved.

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.970
The end result was that I would not be written up for what he claimed I was

14
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:58.410
doing.
He tried to make an example out of me almost as soon as he got here.

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.830
Assuming I was easy to eat.

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.200
He assumed I was an easy target anyways to the point.

17
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.750
Even though he and I had a falling out,

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.050
I'd still like to see the guy succeed at his job and become a great leader.

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.630
After listening to your podcast over the last month,

20
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.890
I'm making an effort to improve our relationship at this job instead of just

21
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:21.660
avoiding the men I've raced.
I've recently purchased your book extreme ownership.

22
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.400
How would you suggest are present this book to my new supervisor and a read or

23
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.900
to read without him feeling as if I'm belittling him as to say he needs work on

24
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.260
his leadership.
I think he could benefit from it greatly.

25
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.430
<v 0>Good question.
Yeah,
it's actually a question I've answered on here before.</v>

26
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.020
Bottle answered again because I even learned when I repeat.
Sure.

27
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.940
This is my latest version of what I tell people when they're in the situation.

28
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:51.170
Yeah.

29
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.340
Updated version because you get better at things and you figure out better ways

30
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:56.900
to overcome challenges,

31
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.630
especially when you're presented with the same challenge over and over again,

32
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:04.250
which I kind of am.
Yeah,
man.
Some challenges like this one,
so here's what,

33
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.180
here's what you do.
You give it to him and you say,

34
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.290
hey,
boss,
or hey person.
Hey,

35
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:17.291
I got this book and I'm trying to really emulate the principles that are in this

36
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:23.390
book.
It really hit me and I was wondering if I could ask you a favor,

37
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:24.650
if you could just look through this book,

38
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:29.651
kind of see what the principles are and then if you see me falling out align

39
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.450
with the principles of that are in this book,
let me know so I can fix them.

40
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.630
Basic things like if I'm not taking ownership of problems,
if I'm,

41
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.000
if I'm not keeping things simple,

42
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.060
if I'm not supporting other people around me covering and moving for them,

43
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.150
just let me know.
That's all I'm asking because I'm,

44
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:49.070
I'm really trying to do a better job.
Could you do that for me?

45
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.970
So then the person says,
well,
yeah,
okay,
fine.
You know,

46
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.220
and then they read the book and when they read the book,

47
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.020
sure there's a chance that there'll be thinking like,
oh,

48
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.190
this book is about everyone else and it's not about me.
Right,
right.

49
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
That's possible.

50
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.590
There is also a chance of a higher chance that they read the book and go,
Oof,

51
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.130
I make a lot of excuses and I blame other people all the time.

52
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.060
I'm probably not doing a great job as a leader and that might be subconscious.

53
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.390
I see that sometimes now where people are subconsciously making adjustments

54
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.090
because they don't want to admit that they're the person that's,
that,

55
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.380
that the problem.
They don't want to admit that they're the problem.

56
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.070
So they make these little adjustments kind of subconsciously.

57
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.960
And other people will tell me that the boss is like changing.
Oh yeah,
they're,

58
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.480
they're changing their game.
They won't admit it,

59
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.070
but they are changing their game.
So that's what you hope for is that they do,

60
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.980
they go through that trance,
that transformation from,
you know,

61
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.670
not taking ownership and treating people bad and not trying to build

62
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:47.050
relationships and all that stuff that makes them into a bad leader in to taking

63
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.870
ownership,
building relationships,
covering,
moving,
keeping things simple,

64
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:54.640
all the stuff that makes you a good leader.
That's what the hope is.
Now

65
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.870
there's also a chance that this person is going gonna hold a grudge,
right?

66
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.630
We,
we,
we got to deal with that.
And I'll tell you,

67
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:08.680
I was recently talking to someone that had stepped on the toes of another

68
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.440
business,
another division inside their business,

69
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.290
another sales division.
And you know,

70
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:19.291
salespeople are sort of known for being protective and aggressive look

71
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.920
protective of their territory.

72
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.970
Well this guy kind of stepped into their territory a little bit,
cause some bad,

73
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:27.880
bad vibes,
giant rift,
and he's like,
you don't,
what should I do?

74
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:30.100
You know why I feel like all this animosity now,

75
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.710
and it's one of those times where I just said to myself,
well,

76
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.020
what would I actually do if I was in that situation?

77
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.930
How would I try and get this problem solved?
Well,

78
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.710
what I would do is walk up to the person who I stepped into their territory and

79
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:46.440
cause problems and I'd say,
Hey,
hey,
I wanted to tell you I've,

80
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.020
I totally was out of line when I stepped into your territory that that was

81
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:52.480
completely my fault.
And you know,

82
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:56.350
I was just got target fixation,
which is bad.

83
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.340
I didn't talk to you,
which is bad.
I stepped into your world,

84
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:04.330
which is bad and I left a disaster.

85
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.530
And I,
I'm sorry.
That's that all that stuff,
everything that I just said,

86
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.580
all my fault and I want to let you know that I completely recognize it.

87
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.170
And number one,

88
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:18.370
anything I can do to try and redeem that and make it up and make you realize

89
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:22.330
that and anything I can do to support and help you move forward.
I,
I don't,

90
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.140
I will not let that happen again.
I just want to let you know that.
So boom,

91
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.480
just step up,
be humble,

92
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.100
apologize and say,
Hey,
can you,

93
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.440
what can I do to help you?
What can I do to support you?

94
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.290
That's where I would go with these,
with this question.
And then a sort of,
uh,
uh,

95
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.940
an addition to that question.
It's kind,
Kinda like,
uh,
you know,
when you,

96
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.690
when you give your both the book,
right?
It'd be like,
Hey,
this is what I'm doing.

97
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.750
Is that kind of like when you,
when you get,
you know,
like if somebody has a bad,

98
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.320
bad breath and then you put in gum,
you know,
you eat some gummies or hey,

99
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:02.300
you want some gum?
Yeah.
That's very similar.
You just break out the gum,

100
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.530
you know,
I was like to do this,
you know,

101
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:07.080
just to make sure I was like to have a piece of gum just to make sure you know a

102
00:06:07.081 --> 00:06:10.730
lot of fun.
Oh you want one?
Yeah,
you could have,
you might want to take to

103
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.990
a check.
Really?
He'll wait.
Yeah.
Shoot.
What if I had bad breath in?
Oh,

104
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.970
let me let me handle this before anyone can smell it and check.
Oh,

105
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.750
you know that just remind me because I laughed.

106
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.750
It just remind me of two things I just saw on the,
on the interwebs.

107
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.350
One was a person that said something negative about,

108
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.440
about the podcast or the book and he said this guy should just smile.

109
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.030
He doesn't,
he never smiles and anything.
And someone of course was like,
dude,

110
00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:41.060
you might want to listen to his podcast because he laughs a lot.

111
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.250
And then someone else said,
this guy should just pick up a guitar.
He doesn't,

112
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.850
he doesn't know anything about Freedom House.

113
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.790
And someone else got on says he does play guitar.
So yeah.
Cool.
Haters.

114
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.300
Not,
not to do a little fact checking.
That's all I'm saying.

115
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.700
If you want to throw some hate around just to a little,

116
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.370
a little fact checking because we're over here laughing.

117
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.250
We're playing the gift box from time to time.

118
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.810
Say you call it to get buck.
Get bollix.
I've ever heard that before.

119
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.440
You got to be old school about one.
Uh,

120
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.150
next question.
Jacob,
do you still respect people without discipline?

121
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.510
Interesting.
Okay.
So first of all,

122
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:29.920
my baseline as a person just to respect people.
That's my baseline.

123
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.360
Now that is not the same as something we've talked about before about before,

124
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:37.780
which is that doesn't mean I expect a lot from them.
Okay?

125
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.120
You see the big difference there?
I respect people.
Hey,
I respect you.
Your Spec,

126
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:41.531
what you're doing.

127
00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:45.850
That doesn't mean I expect that you're going to be humble or you're going to be

128
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:48.850
hardworking or you're going to be brave or you're going to even be a slightly

129
00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:52.480
diff,
decent human being.
I don't expect any of that,
but,

130
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.450
but I,
and let me,
let me phrase this carefully.

131
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.750
That doesn't mean I don't treat them with respect.

132
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.910
Now you notice I just changed this.
Yes.

133
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.970
It's not just about I actually respect you.
It's,

134
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.380
I'm going to treat you with respect.
There's a big difference,
right?
I'm going to,

135
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.570
I'm going to treat everyone with respect,

136
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.590
but as far as actually respecting someone,

137
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.720
um,
no,
no,

138
00:08:18.721 --> 00:08:22.530
I'm not just automatically respect and people now will treat them with respect

139
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:24.300
because I don't know who they are.

140
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.750
I don't know what struggles they've had in their life.

141
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.570
I don't know what they've been through.
I don't know that.

142
00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:32.940
So I'm going to treat him with respect.
And it's very similar,

143
00:08:32.941 --> 00:08:36.960
like a Jujitsu perspective.
You don't know sp okay.

144
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.040
Do you get to perspective Nogi Right.
You don't know how good someone is.

145
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.920
You don't,
you don't.
And,
and this is another thing when you,

146
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.010
when you know how good someone is,
and let's say you're better than them.

147
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.470
If you really understand Jujitsu,

148
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.040
you realize that you're better than them because you've been training longer.

149
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.320
Yeah.
Fundamentally.
Yeah.
Right?
Of course.

150
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.530
Are there some people that are just an amazing athletes?
Yeah,
sure,
sure.

151
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.040
But 98% of the people,
you've just been training longer than them,

152
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.050
or you just were born a lot bigger than them or a lot stronger than them.

153
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.350
But you look at them and say,
you know what,
if this person had,

154
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.780
if we flip this around and this person been training longer,

155
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.210
I'd be the one getting crushed.
Right?

156
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.770
So there's that now.
So,
so yes,

157
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:27.690
I treat people with respect and my,
my attitude is generally to say,

158
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:28.680
look,
I don't know what they've been through,

159
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:33.640
so I'm going gonna I'm going to treat them that way.
Now that being said,

160
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.700
when someone just throws away their potential because they lack discipline,

161
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.400
that kind of bothers me.
I mean,
it doesn't mean that I don't respect them,

162
00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:48.560
but I am definitely disappointed.

163
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

164
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.390
<v 0>And in conditions where there is a gross lack of discipline,</v>

165
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.880
just a gross lack of discipline,

166
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.420
I do move beyond just mere disappointment and I do get into the realm of,

167
00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:07.480
I do not respect that person because they lack discipline.
So

168
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:09.843
there you go.

169
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.020
So it's like a respect meter kind of thing and you're starting at the base line.

170
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.810
Yeah,
the thing,
yeah.
I always start with treating everyone with respect.
Yeah.

171
00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:22.270
Yeah.
Going to treat everyone with respect.
Yeah.
And if you don't,

172
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.270
you don't know who you're disrespecting.
Yeah.
Right.
Who are you disrespect?

173
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.850
I mean,
you could be disrespecting me.
First of all,

174
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:31.040
you could be disrespecting someone that is,
uh,

175
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.200
been through a lot that maybe you should learn from.
You could be,
you know,

176
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.740
you're walking down the street and you disrespect.

177
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.980
You could disrespect someone that's a psychopath with a gun.
Yeah.

178
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.210
And now you're in a shootout with them.
People are getting,
you know,
I mean,

179
00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:45.680
you're probably going to win if you train hard,

180
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.100
but still probably innocence might be,
you know,
by standards,
you know,

181
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.340
just don't know who.
You just know who people are.
Yeah.

182
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.860
That's a bird lesson to learn from Jujitsu,
man.

183
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.500
You don't know how good people are.
You don't know.
We're not just,

184
00:10:57.501 --> 00:10:58.550
not just how well they train,

185
00:10:58.551 --> 00:11:01.860
but what have they been through that day in their life.
Yeah.
Yo,

186
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.510
you meet some people in the wrong day and that can be really a real problem.

187
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.290
Yeah.
So just be careful.
And you know what's funny,
I was thinking about this,

188
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:13.400
that being said,
my uh,
my buddy from Scotland,

189
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.503
his name is Colin,

190
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.370
and he sent me a text the other day and he was listening to the podcast and he's

191
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:24.371
a very avid listener of the podcast and he said,

192
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.370
he said finally after 94 podcasts,

193
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.370
I understand what that being said means,

194
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.290
and he's right when he said that being said is

195
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.790
basically the verbalization of the dichotomy of leadership and of life and

196
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.610
things and of the world.

197
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.320
Because that means that being said is when you recognize that one side of things

198
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.170
is balanced by another side of things.
And it's true in everything there is,

199
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.860
right?
Like you could say,
Jujitsu is the best martial art.
That being said,

200
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.950
if someone wrestled in college and they're 262 pounds and you're 145 pounds,

201
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:09.580
it's going to be problematic for you.
And you could say about leadership,
hey,

202
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:12.310
it's good to be aggressive and assertive.
That being said,

203
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.500
if you're overly aggressive,
no one's going to want to work for you.

204
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.850
So it applies across the board.
It's those opposing forces.

205
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.190
So I think it's a good tool to use.
When you think about things,

206
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:26.680
what does the other side of the argument,

207
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:31.681
what is the other side of the situation and knowing and and studying the other

208
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:33.880
side will make you understand everything

209
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.290
<v 1>better.
Yeah.
That being said,</v>

210
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:41.140
it can be very difficult to understand anything that's life really.

211
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.270
So then no expectation.
And I think we talked,
I know we talked about this before,

212
00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:50.010
but you say I don't have any expectations.
That's low expert,

213
00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:51.870
very low experts expectation.

214
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:56.580
A lot of times people will take that as like you expect low performance out of

215
00:12:56.581 --> 00:13:00.240
me,
you know,
which is different.
There's no,
no.
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.

216
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.770
You're correct.
Yeah.
Cause that essentially means that you do have expectations.

217
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:09.330
They're just like negative,
you know,
I expect like low-performance how of you,

218
00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:11.520
I expect you to do the wrong thing or something like that.

219
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.450
My expectations are low.
My hope is high.
Yeah.

220
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.240
<v 0>Url,
you know,
hardworking,</v>

221
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.400
very diligent squared away human being.
That's so

222
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.233
<v 1>technically,</v>

223
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.890
so obviously you know the difference between expecting poor performance or just

224
00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:30.830
having a clean slate.
No real expectations.

225
00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:32.390
And I'm going to take things the way they come.

226
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.830
Obviously you know the difference there.

227
00:13:33.831 --> 00:13:37.850
So what would you call when someone says,
I have low expectations of you,

228
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.970
I sounds like they expect you to do junk.
Yeah.
That tell us that sounds bad.

229
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.920
I have low expectations so,
but so put your hands up and say hey,
no expectations.

230
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.150
Okay.
That sounds different.
Yeah,
you're right.
I saw,

231
00:13:51.151 --> 00:13:54.990
I guess I guess my expectations are closer to the no expectations.
Yeah.

232
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:59.480
I don't expect negativity.
Yes.
But I don't expect much either beings.

233
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.140
I like to set a low bar.
Right.
Right.

234
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.280
And then let them and let pleasantly impressed.
Yeah.
Makes Sense.

235
00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.500
So it's kind of like,
it'll be expectation or respect or,

236
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.430
and the respect meter is kind of at this cool exceptable baseline.
Right.

237
00:14:16.431 --> 00:14:20.150
Just fundamental stuff fundamental.
Don't you know,
whatever,
you know,

238
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.210
don't step on my feet on purpose the first time you meet any kind of thing.

239
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.750
And then with every little action,
big or small,

240
00:14:26.751 --> 00:14:28.380
with every experience with that person,

241
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:33.430
the meter either goes up or it goes down and it depends on the violation or the

242
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.550
whatever the element that's going to impress your right.
So let's say someone,

243
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.530
it's weird now you know how like people we get impressed by like stuff that

244
00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:44.480
scene it seems like you're supposed to do,

245
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.490
did you just say we cause are you talking about me too?
I think so.
Okay.
I Dunno,

246
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.130
that's a total assumption,
but like,
okay,
are you impressed with people

247
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.450
<v 3>who keep their word?
Absolutely right?
Yeah.
That's an example.</v>

248
00:14:56.451 --> 00:15:00.590
So you're supposed to keep your word.
That's what your,
where it is,
you keep it,

249
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.860
you know,
that's kind of what the whole defining characteristic.

250
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.970
So you're saying where it is you're saying some other person might say,

251
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.790
well I just expect people right there.
We're supposed to do that.
You know,

252
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:13.870
I remember like how Chris Rock on his little standup thing.
He'd be like,
Oh yeah,

253
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.880
people want like credit for stuff you're supposed to do.
Like he's like,

254
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:18.770
I can take care of my kids.
I was like,
yeah,

255
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:21.350
you're supposed to take care of your kids,
you know kind of thing.

256
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.730
But when you think about it,

257
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.640
are you impressed with someone who takes good care of their kids?

258
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.700
You kind of are,
right?
Yeah.

259
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.430
But that's not to say you expect them not to though.
Really.
It's,

260
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.840
you just have what I'm saying,

261
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:39.580
which is no expert close leaning towards no expectations.

262
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.770
And then when you experiencing,
you kind of fall on one side of it,

263
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:45.230
you know whether it'd be like,
yeah,
that makes me happy.

264
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:48.080
It makes me happy that you're doing what you're supposed to do.

265
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.030
That's what it is right there.
Right.

266
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.240
Pretty much like when you showed up today,
I was happy.
Wait,

267
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.310
you were at a hair show them well,
yeah,

268
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.560
when I showed up and saw you here,
I was happy you were here.
Oh,

269
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.380
that's what you're supposed to be here.
We agreed we were going to be here.
Right.

270
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.530
That's happy.
Well that's cool.

271
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.750
I guess what I was there just stoked to see me,
but yeah,

272
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.220
I wasn't impressed,
but I was happy.
Hmm,
okay.

273
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.870
I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it anyway.

274
00:16:21.871 --> 00:16:22.940
I don't even know what you're getting the bottom too,

275
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:26.150
but maybe we can do another question.
Just your expectations and respect,

276
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:30.770
you know,
really the whole,
the meticulous and specific dynamics of that.

277
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.690
That's what we're going for there.
Okay.
I think.
Anyway,
next question.
Cool.

278
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.340
Real cool.
Jocko,

279
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:42.630
wha what do I do when one of my teammates isn't really pulling their weight?

280
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.500
They used to be pretty good,
but things have gone downhill.
How can I get,

281
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.380
how can I get them to fix themselves?

282
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.190
It has extra tricky because he's a friend of mine.

283
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.500
Okay,
well you got your,

284
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.890
your teammate slash friend that's not pulling their weight and how do you get

285
00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:09.200
them back in the game?
First thing I'm going to do,
actually,

286
00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:11.750
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to help them.

287
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.670
I'm going to help them.
I'm going to take some weight off of their shoulders.

288
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.330
I'm going to,
I'm going to actually step in and say,
oh yeah,
hey,
echo.

289
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.670
You know you've got that,
that project working on and you know what?

290
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:24.080
That little assignment you got hanging up.

291
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.900
How can I stay at the office a little bit late tonight?
I'm going to knock the,

292
00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:28.430
just give that to me.
I'll just hammer it out tonight.

293
00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:30.680
I'm going to be here anyways cause I gotta pick up my kids late from school.

294
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.940
Is that cool?
Just take a little way off.
Sure.
Just do what you can.
You know,

295
00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:36.650
maybe just carry some,

296
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.560
how do you know what that person that got going on at home?
Yeah.
Right.

297
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.160
What are you going to jump right down their throat and get all in their face?

298
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.870
Make it worse and get things worse when actually that person has a sick kid or

299
00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:50.190
has a problem with their husband

300
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.640
<v 0>or wife or whatever and now we're getting in their face and getting their grill</v>

301
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:57.000
about it.
Yeah,
no,
I'm just going to lean in and give him,
give him a hand.

302
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.210
That seems like what a good teammate would do,

303
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.560
especially if the person is your friend.

304
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.390
So get in there and hopefully they'll say,
hey,

305
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.480
hey,
thanks.
You know what?
I got this problem at home or thanks,

306
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:13.170
I've got this health issue going on and you ain't no problem.
And guess what?

307
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:15.870
We just built a little relationship.
We on it a little bit tighter.

308
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.150
We were friends,
now we're even a little bit tighter friends.

309
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.740
So that's a positive things.

310
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.040
Now there's also a chance of course that well and to continue down that story,

311
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:26.920
eventually they get healthier,

312
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.430
they resolve the problem at home and they get back in the game and then we're

313
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:32.910
all good.
And guess who the next person that might need a little assistance?

314
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:36.150
It might be you,
you might be the one with a problem with a health issue,

315
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:37.890
with a sick family member or whatever,

316
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.720
and you're the one that might have to lean on them.

317
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.690
You want them to get in your face and start yelling at you about pulling your

318
00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:46.500
weight,
or do you just want them to say,
Hey,
I got some capacity right now.

319
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.970
Let me help you out.
Yeah,
right.
It's,

320
00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:52.110
it's so clear how you want to handle that.
Number one,

321
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:54.120
you just want to take some ownership of what's going on.

322
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.770
Now there's also the chance that once they've come back or that you,

323
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:02.490
you help them out and they like start looking at you and saying,
Oh,
you know,

324
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.900
Jack was just going to do all my work for me.
Jocko was just going to,
you know,

325
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:09.480
I can just lean on him.
He's going to do everything.
Oh,

326
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.790
I gave him one task I'll get,

327
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.360
I'll let them do this other tasks that I've been assigned,

328
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:13.710
I'll let them do another task number aside.

329
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.260
And if people start giving me their work to do good,

330
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.060
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do their work,
I'm going to do their work.

331
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.580
And if they want me to do all of their work,

332
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.980
I'll do all their work and eventually they won't have a job anymore.

333
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.750
And then I'll take their job and then I'll have,

334
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.010
I'll get promoted and all hire more people that are going to do the right thing

335
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:42.640
and get after it.
Right.
So that's okay.
When,

336
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:47.810
when somebody wants to put themselves on report for being lazy by allowing you

337
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:50.070
to do work their work for them,

338
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.310
allow them to fill out that report in full detail.

339
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.070
And the other thing is,
so then do you,
do you jump up and down and say,
look,

340
00:19:59.071 --> 00:20:01.740
I'm doing echoes job look,
come do.
No,
no,
no,
no.
You don't do that.

341
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.990
You don't do that.
You don't need to do that.

342
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.460
You may want to do it because you feel like you need to do it but you don't.

343
00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:11.460
Sure you the recognition will come.
You just need to be patient.

344
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.510
Of course on top of all this,

345
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.440
there is some indirect coaching that you can do to try and get them up to speed,

346
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.340
you know,
as opposed to saying you're screwed up echo and said,
you say,
Hey Echo,

347
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.170
I got some extra capacity with what's going on.

348
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:27.420
Is there anything I can do to help you out?
You know he's,

349
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:29.190
they're getting support that you need because I know you,
you're,

350
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:32.580
this part of the task is a little bit bigger than mine.
And so you know,

351
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:34.170
is there anything I can do to help you get the job done?

352
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.360
Do you need any support from me?
Cause I'm,

353
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.830
I'm actually elevating you a little bit by saying your task is harder at

354
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:45.270
challenging in bigger and more important.
Or you can also say,
Hey,

355
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.320
is there anything we should we need from the boss too to help us down here?

356
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.810
Are there any support that we should get from up the chain of command?

357
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.390
Because I think if we go with a unified front,
we could get some help.

358
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.750
I'm actually feeling pretty good about my area of responsibilities.

359
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:00.910
But are you feeling good about yours?
Cause if not,

360
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.470
maybe you need some more support or we could get it from,

361
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:06.910
if we go to the boss as a unified front and make it happen,
and then you say,

362
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:08.980
Oh yeah,
well you know what?
I got this and I need another person,

363
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:10.810
or I need some more man hours,
or whatever the case may be.

364
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.610
We get you moving in the right direction
and that's it.

365
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.860
What if they're just slacking?
They're just lacking.
Cool.
Let them slide thing.

366
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.210
Yeah,
let him suck.
There's also,

367
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:26.260
there's also thing where a lot of times when I come and take your work from you,

368
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.880
if you're not just a Turd,
you'll be like,
yeah.
He's like,
Hey,
you know Jocko ea,

369
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:33.190
you did this last week.
I got it,
man.
It's no problem.

370
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.810
You as a human being will feel like you're not carrying the weight for the
tribe.

371
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.660
And when human beings feel like they're not carrying the weight for the tribe,

372
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.530
they,
they want to help.
They feel like they're not going to get there.

373
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.360
Their piece of meat.
Right.
So they want to help out.
You ever seen,

374
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.410
you know,
you're,
that's what your mom used to do to you and you were a kid just,

375
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.730
they'd just be cleaning it.
You something you feel like,
okay,

376
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:03.320
I need to help.
Yeah,
100% or you'll see,
you know,
your wife,

377
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.960
my wife will do that to you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

378
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:07.690
She'll do that to me all the time actually,
every single time.
So,

379
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.130
you know how like,
you know,
I don't know,
Saturday comes,
you know,

380
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.350
we don't have any plans on Saturday,

381
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.740
so I'm cruising and my waist starts taking on this kind of big cleaning project,

382
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.310
the garage,
whatever,
I dunno,
garage in my case.

383
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.260
And then she'll kind of walk and she'll be like,
hey,
you know,

384
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.910
what do you want me to do with this thing that I found in the back corner of the

385
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:33.460
garage?
What do you want to do this?
And then three minutes later she's back.

386
00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:37.150
What do you want me to do with this thing?
Well,
no,
well,
yeah,

387
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.690
of course that happens all the time.
But as far as the example for this,

388
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.540
the comparison is she'll be like,
hey,

389
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:47.050
can you clean up this whole thing right here?
And I'll be like,
I'll be like,

390
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:50.860
oh yeah,
you know,
like I didn't really plan on that whole big project right now.

391
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.130
So you know,
maybe I'm kind of doing this unimportant thing or whatever.

392
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.340
I'll be like,
yeah,
I'll do it in a few minutes.
But then I'll see her doing it.

393
00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.030
Oh you know what I'm saying?
And then doing my work.
All right,
I got to do it.

394
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:04.150
I can't let her do my job cause it's kind of my job now.

395
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.450
Well one time my wife on the opposite on the spectrum,

396
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:12.810
we were planning to Redo my backyard a little bit and we were going to put in

397
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.540
like a five foot retaining wall with concrete block and dig a foundation and all

398
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:24.820
that.
And then we backfill the soil to fill it up to the level of the five foot

399
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:29.280
retaining wall.
And so I kind of talked about my wife,
you know,
I was going to,

400
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.650
you know,
hey,
this is what we're going to do.

401
00:23:30.651 --> 00:23:31.630
We're going to build this retaining wall.

402
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:34.240
We'll put some steps here or it'll be good.
We can backfill,

403
00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:36.970
we'll have a level yards.
It'd be really nice and so,

404
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:42.050
so then like on a Sunday at like one o'clock in the afternoon,

405
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.070
she's like,
why don't you build retaining wall today?

406
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.900
And I was like,
you know,

407
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:54.140
it's a little late in the day for me to start that project right now.

408
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.700
Why you got to get it all done?
Because this was like a nine day project.
Yeah,

409
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.410
yeah.
That's why.
Oh,
she wanted you to build it right in there.
Hey,

410
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.180
what are you doing this afternoon?
If you're not doing anything,

411
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:05.780
how much you build a five foot concrete block retaining wall over here with

412
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:08.300
drainage and then backfill and put sod down.

413
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.240
That sounds like something you could do in the afternoon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hurry up.

414
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:21.420
<v 1>Next question.
Look,</v>

415
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.330
I'm not talking that good into my microphone.

416
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.250
Whichever Jocko.
I'm a high school teacher.

417
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.950
I consider myself the leader in the classroom.

418
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.870
How do I demonstrate extreme ownership in the classroom?
For example,

419
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.310
one of my students misbehaves,
how do I take extreme ownership of their behavior?

420
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.880
Okay,
one way to do this,
and

421
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.320
<v 0>I do this with my kids.
I did it with my platoon guys,</v>

422
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:56.120
couldn't do it with Jujitsu kids,
whoever.

423
00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.320
And what you do is you do exactly what you're saying you want to do,

424
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:01.730
which is you take ownership.

425
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.720
So what that means is you take ownership of their behavior.

426
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.320
So when something goes,
when the kid's misbehaving,

427
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.530
<v 2>okay,</v>

428
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.570
<v 0>you say,
Hey,</v>

429
00:25:12.571 --> 00:25:16.020
what am I not making clear to you that you continue to act like this?

430
00:25:16.021 --> 00:25:18.660
Cause obviously I must be doing something wrong because I'm the teacher and

431
00:25:18.661 --> 00:25:22.440
you're in here acting like an idiot and disrupting everything.

432
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.570
What am I not doing well?

433
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.650
How could I convey this message to you that that you should not like that.

434
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:29.641
Not only that,

435
00:25:29.641 --> 00:25:33.780
but how can I better make you understand that what you do right now is going to

436
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.310
affect and impact of the rest of your whole life?
Because I want you,

437
00:25:38.311 --> 00:25:42.000
I'm supposed to convey that to you as a person.
That

438
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.710
if you get engaged in class,

439
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.620
you're going to have a more successful and better life.

440
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:51.770
And that's what my kind of goal is.

441
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.940
And so what I want to know is how I can better explain to you,

442
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:57.650
<v 2>okay</v>

443
00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:02.650
<v 0>that your behavior while you're in here from classroom attendance to having big</v>

444
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.110
outburst,
to skipping class,
to not turning in your homework,
to failing tests,

445
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.770
all those behaviors that you kind of display on a regular basis.

446
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:18.250
I need to find a better way to explain to you that the way you are acting right

447
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:23.150
now will absolutely dictate where you're going to be in the future.

448
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.150
And it,
and by the way,
it's not a positive thing.

449
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.190
It's not a positive thing at all.
Your life is going in the wrong direction.

450
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.190
And as a teacher,
I'm supposed to move it in the right direction.

451
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.520
So what do you think I could do better to help you understand that?

452
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.283
<v 2>Hm.</v>

453
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.870
<v 0>So there we go.
That's,
that's,
that's one method.
And by the way,</v>

454
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:49.620
I've used that with my kids too.
That's a very effective method for parenting.

455
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.250
Hmm.
Is isn't why did you not clean your room?

456
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:58.610
It's how did I fail as a father to it to make you understand that basic

457
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.420
fundamental hygiene is a positive thing.

458
00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.540
Where did I,
where did I fail?

459
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.860
And that's actually the cleaning room example isn't a great one,

460
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:17.610
but when it's something a little bit more severe than that,

461
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.230
something like when they really do something that's outside of the lines,
right?

462
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.310
And you say instead of saying,
you know,
you went outside the lines,

463
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.890
you're messed up.
Instead you say,

464
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.300
I'm sorry that I couldn't convey to you the importance of these lines and why we

465
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:40.680
don't go out them and now,
now,
now I'm looking at you and I'm thinking,

466
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.110
I don't know what mistakes I made and I let you down as,

467
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.880
as a father because clearly you don't understand the boundaries of,

468
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.940
of what is good and what is bad and I feel like I let you down and that for my

469
00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:56.970
kids provokes a better reaction than you that you screwed up.

470
00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.940
I'm now going on.

471
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:07.941
The other thing you can do here is you can explain how their behavior affects

472
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:13.380
and impacts everyone else in the class and that you as the teacher is not only

473
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:15.600
responsible for their behavior,
which you are,

474
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.960
but you're also responsible for teaching every single person in the class

475
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.600
and and that you own,

476
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:27.370
that you own the education of these other kids and that you're not going to let

477
00:28:27.371 --> 00:28:28.570
one kid

478
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:35.060
destroy the experience for everyone else because that is not fair and you will

479
00:28:35.061 --> 00:28:37.130
not do it.
I'm not going to let that happen.

480
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.340
I'm not going to let you come in here and impact all these other kids with your

481
00:28:40.341 --> 00:28:43.160
negativity and your bad behavior.
These kids are here to learn.

482
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.140
They actually want to do something with their lives.

483
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.290
They want to take over and dominate.
They want to win,

484
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.550
and I'm looking at you and I think you must want to lose because that's where,

485
00:28:52.551 --> 00:28:53.384
that's where you're heading.

486
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.130
That's what you want to do is lose in life because these other kids,

487
00:28:58.131 --> 00:29:01.180
they want to win.
So I'm not going to let that happen.

488
00:29:01.181 --> 00:29:04.630
I'm not going to let them lose because you want to lose.
If you want to lose,

489
00:29:04.631 --> 00:29:07.330
you can go do it on your own time in the principal's office

490
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.630
and then you,
maybe you have to kick them out of class.

491
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.350
Maybe you have to suspend them and for a while or whatever.
And

492
00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.400
I think that then you have to let people understand that just like you take

493
00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:23.650
ownership,
they should take ownership of their lives,
right?

494
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.800
That's the fundamental thing that you're getting at.

495
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.250
And lastly,

496
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.760
and this is something that I think is very hard for young kids to understand,

497
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.471
young kids,

498
00:29:35.471 --> 00:29:40.471
meaning the ages between like 15 and 2025 maybe 25 some get it earlier.

499
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.230
You know,
some kids understand it earlier,

500
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.300
but understanding this thread of this,

501
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.160
this thread of the passage of your life and that the way that you act right now

502
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.870
affects the where you're going to be in a week,
in a month,
a year,

503
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.010
in five years and 10 years.
And kids do not understand that.

504
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.090
They do not understand it.

505
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:08.650
I didn't understand it when I was 10 1215 1830

506
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.860
you know what I mean?
Like,
well I think,
I think actually one of the things,

507
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:18.790
one of the best things for me is that when you joined the military,
they,

508
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.310
they show you that thread and it's very clear.
They're like,
hey,

509
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.420
you do this and you get promoted,
you do this and you get advanced.

510
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:27.460
You get this and you get your paycheck.
You get this.

511
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.130
Oh and you do this other thing.
You don't get a paycheck.

512
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.410
You didn't do this other thing.
You go to the Brig,

513
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.850
you do this other thing and you will,
you'll won't make it through seal training.

514
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.580
So you know,
that was for me,

515
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:43.360
I shouldn't have said get promoted because for me it was get to seal training

516
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.260
and get through seal training.
I didn't care about getting promoted,
I never did.

517
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.633
But to get,

518
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.820
when I was 18 years old to get to seal training and to get through seal

519
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:56.980
training,
that was a crystal clear path for me.

520
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.090
And I saw it and as soon as I saw it I said,
okay,
I will not veer off that path.

521
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.100
What they tell me to do,
I'll do now.

522
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.330
There's nothing that's that solid for a civilian,
right.
For civilian to say,
okay,

523
00:31:07.331 --> 00:31:10.210
if you do this right now,
you're going to get into this college.

524
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.090
If you get into this college and you get these kinds of grades,

525
00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:14.620
you're going to get this kind of job.

526
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.510
There's no real clear path like that and so it's harder to draw that thread for

527
00:31:19.511 --> 00:31:24.100
people,
but I think you can do it.
I think you're going to show examples of,
of,

528
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.970
of where you end up in the societal structure based on your behavior as a

529
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.530
teenage person.
A teenage human.
Yeah.
Yeah.

530
00:31:32.531 --> 00:31:34.750
That's going to be hard just straight up.

531
00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.820
That's just going to be hard for a teacher because,

532
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.600
because of the time constraints like that or the time limitations that you have

533
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:43.300
with the,
with the kid.
Yeah.

534
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.510
I think one thing that is I've done with with my kids is I look at other human

535
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:54.310
beings in the world with them and I explained to them that that's a person

536
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.640
that's a person.
I was talking about this with my son.

537
00:31:57.641 --> 00:31:59.020
It left such an impact on him.

538
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:03.100
Yesterday we were down at the beach early morning one time,
years ago,

539
00:32:03.101 --> 00:32:05.650
he was probably probably eight years old.

540
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:09.460
We were going surfing waves were good by the way.
It was a big day.
Hell yeah,

541
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:10.540
we got done.

542
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.080
And so now it's seven 38 o'clock in the morning and there's a guy that's an

543
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:22.050
obvious drug induced state of mayhem and he's got five cops and they get him

544
00:32:25.121 --> 00:32:29.530
down and we're watching this whole thing and he's yelling,
swearing,
and they,

545
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.620
they put a spit bag on his head.

546
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.020
So he's just full on crazy.
And you know,
my son saying,
what is that dad?

547
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:38.620
You know,
and say,

548
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.470
oh that's a bag so that this guy doesn't spit on these police officers that are

549
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:45.740
down here doing their job.
And,
you know,
I said,

550
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:49.610
this is what happens when you go on drugs.
This is where you end up.

551
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:54.640
You end up with no shirt on one shoe,
a rip jeans,

552
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.050
you,
you have a spit back on your head,

553
00:32:57.051 --> 00:33:01.430
you're handcuffed and you're going to jail.
That's where you end up.

554
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.900
That's where the path leads.
So don't do those things.
Don't,

555
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:08.900
don't start down that path.
And it's the same thing.
You know,

556
00:33:08.901 --> 00:33:12.980
I was with my daughter and we saw,

557
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.720
what did we see?
I was pointing out to her again,

558
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.920
someone,
a woman that clearly didn't have a place to live.

559
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.960
Um,
you know,
she was a homeless person and I,

560
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:28.251
you know,

561
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:31.490
walking with my daughter and we see the woman with the shopping cart and it's

562
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:33.220
filled with,
you know,
stuff,
you know,

563
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.740
crap and sleeping bags and cans and whatever.

564
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.830
Clearly a homeless person but was weird.

565
00:33:39.831 --> 00:33:44.660
And the reason I specifically pointed out was because she looked somewhat,

566
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.680
somewhat normal and yet you could tell that she was not doing well.

567
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.730
And so,
you know,
I said to my daughter,
I said,

568
00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:02.060
what do you think of of that person?
And she's obsessed.
I Dunno,
what do you mean?

569
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.040
I said,
well,
do you think that person wants to be there?
And she said,
well,

570
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.220
we'll know.
And I said,
well,
how do you think she ended up there?
And she said,

571
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:12.590
I don't know.
And I said,
you know,
I don't know.
I don't know either.

572
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.190
But that's a real person.
And when she goes to bed tonight,

573
00:34:16.191 --> 00:34:18.920
she's going to be underneath a bridge somewhere.
It's going to be cold.

574
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.880
She's going to be wet,
she's going to be miserable.
And that is how,

575
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.800
that's her life.
That's where she ended up.

576
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:30.370
So some choices that she made along the way may have contributed to that.

577
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:36.970
And what I'm saying to you is make choices that will contribute to you not

578
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.990
ending up in that position.

579
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:44.240
Because those people that you see that are homeless,
that are addicted to drugs,

580
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.770
those people are actually people and you can,

581
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.490
it's very easy to view them as all,
I could never be there.
They're not,

582
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:56.930
there are different species than me.
They're not.
That's,

583
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.950
I guess that's the,

584
00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:02.950
that's the point of my story is that it's really easy for people to look at

585
00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:06.050
other people and think that that's not,
I could never be there.

586
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.400
That could not happen to me.
And my point to my kids is,
Oh yes it can.

587
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.930
If you make the wrong choices it,
hey,
you know what?
You're going to be bad luck.

588
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.010
Sure it can be bad luck.
It can be bad luck.
But most of the time,

589
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.850
the vast majority of time it's decision making,
bad decision making,

590
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.760
get you in bad situations.
And by the way,

591
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.980
people that go off the path and,
and then they say,
you know what?

592
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.090
I screwed up.

593
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:36.990
I did the wrong thing and I'm going to now fix it.
That's,

594
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.940
you don't see people like that that are homeless.

595
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:42.000
You don't see people like that at a better addicted to drugs because they take

596
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:44.940
responsibility and they say,
okay,
I made this mistake.

597
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.560
I didn't do the right things.
I need to get fixed.
And they fix it.

598
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.720
Whereas someone that says,

599
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.370
oh it's my parents' fault and it's my boyfriend's fault and it's my girlfriend's

600
00:35:56.371 --> 00:36:00.270
fault and it's my old bosses fault and it's my pushers fault.

601
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.970
And whoever you want to blame,
it's,
if it's not your fault,
you don't have,

602
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.810
you don't fix the problem,
you don't take ownership of the problem,

603
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:10.560
you don't fix it on a personal level.
And that's problematic.
Yeah.

604
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.980
<v 1>Your parents were teachers,
Huh?
Yes.
Both teachers.
Yeah.</v>

605
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.140
Make that there's a lot of,

606
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.550
it seems like there's a lot of similarities with teachers and then parents.

607
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.110
Right?
Cause it's both like you're both trying to guide these young lines.
Sure.

608
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.380
By the way,
kids,
teenagers,
whatever.
Yeah.

609
00:36:32.381 --> 00:36:37.381
They can't really have United say they don't understand the correlation between

610
00:36:37.631 --> 00:36:39.240
like their actions now they,

611
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.790
they kind of can't because that part of their brain isn't developed it the front

612
00:36:42.791 --> 00:36:46.740
part,
uncle,
whatever,
what's called the front part.
That's off the tech part.

613
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.730
I think that's the medical term,

614
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.350
but it tends to on average or whatever,

615
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.840
develop by age 25 that's why I said,
oh 25 okay.
So that's typically,

616
00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:02.500
you know,
give or take when it,
when it's done developing.
So yeah,
before that.

617
00:37:02.501 --> 00:37:05.590
And it's basically the decision making like,
okay,
what I just,
what he said,

618
00:37:05.591 --> 00:37:08.830
what I do now affects the future.
And you know,
like now you're like,
oh,

619
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.310
when you do something,
you can almost feel the payoff in the future.

620
00:37:12.311 --> 00:37:15.640
It's almost like that,
you understand it.
No.
Back then you couldn't,

621
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.840
that's why these colleges that when you go to college at 18 or 17,
in my case,

622
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.290
they all,
all these credit card,
little credit card pushers,

623
00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:27.910
they'll just post up outside of your dorm room and be like,
Hey,
an unsecured,

624
00:37:27.911 --> 00:37:32.260
I don't even know what unsecured means,
by the way,
at this time,
a $300 limit,

625
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.000
just crit credits,
free money.
It's free money.

626
00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:36.440
That's how they do all you gotta do is fill out this thing.
And everyone,

627
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.560
of course,
of course,
I don't know what that means.

628
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:43.130
I'll pay it back whole way later.
So they get you like that.
But nonetheless,
um,

629
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.700
yeah,
so they don't have that part of their brain.
They don't know.

630
00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.940
So the answer is I'm Kinda drawing from my childhood.

631
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.760
So I had these two teachers,
right?

632
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:59.910
One teacher's name was Mr Takita Japanese guy and he was like a little summer I

633
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:04.450
Ninja guy.
He didn't really talk that much like outside of the classroom.

634
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:07.210
And when he'd talk in the classroom it was all deliberate stuff.

635
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.990
There was no small talk.
It was really rigid.
We had a quiz every single Friday,

636
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.550
every single Friday came questions,
real short quiz about the weak stuff.

637
00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.150
He's a little lecture on the board was like boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

638
00:38:19.151 --> 00:38:23.170
I think he'd even underlying the key points,
you know,
so you'd know there was,

639
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.280
there was no like,
hey read this and I'm going to just,
you know,
mystery.

640
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:28.150
This is where you can be done.

641
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.670
He underlined the key points and you got to know those key points.

642
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:35.320
At the end of the week test every week,
boom you take or quiz,
it's quiz,

643
00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:37.150
then there's a test on all this stuff or whatever.

644
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.930
But you are not ill equipped for these tests.

645
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.510
You knew as long as you're showing up,
paying,
attending,

646
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:46.690
you knew so either you did it or you didn't do it,
you know,
so it was,

647
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.770
and there was no like,
hey guys,
nothing that you could,
you knew what to expect.

648
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:52.420
This guy was so consistent with every,

649
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.310
every little thing all the way down to the like if you call them Takita cause

650
00:38:57.311 --> 00:38:59.520
sometimes that's how you know when you get real chummy with it,

651
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.900
with the teachers,
just in general,
if you're that kind of person,

652
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.600
you won't say mister or Mrs. Right.
So some everyone saw,
you'd be like,
Hey,

653
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.020
I don't know Smith,
we'll just see if the teacher's name was Mrs. Smith.

654
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:14.170
He'd be like,
Hey Smith.
And you know,
it's a kind of chummy relationship.

655
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:19.240
So one time I forget who it was,
it might've been this girl Cressey.
Anyway,

656
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.750
he goes,
oh Quito.
Cause she like,
don't mean he was a likable guy.

657
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:27.130
That's the thing.
But um,
but just really consistent and rigid,

658
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:31.840
like a Ninja or something.
And they were like,
Hey Takita and ask a question.

659
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.840
And he didn't get mad or nothing like that.
He just answers a court real stoic.

660
00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:39.370
This answers the question.
And as he's shuffling his papers like this,

661
00:39:39.371 --> 00:39:44.110
just real life,
this guy was sup,
cold,
cold,
cold as ice guy.
He goes like this,

662
00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.950
boom.
He answers a question and it goes,
and that's Mr to Quito.

663
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.830
And then he just continues on.
Right?
And I was like,
Dang,

664
00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:53.680
that was fucking awesome.
But anyway,

665
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:58.930
I did the best in that class because it was one of those things that it was so

666
00:39:58.931 --> 00:40:02.770
consistent,
but there was no room for slack.
If,
if you slacked off,

667
00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:05.260
it was really apparent.
Discipline Equals Freedom,
you know?

668
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.450
But he wasn't the kind of like,
he wouldn't yell at you.

669
00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.590
It wasn't that I don't yell.
Yeah.
So discipline equals freedom.

670
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:13.160
You don't need to yell when you,

671
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.230
when people understand expectations and the thing and you'd like this to where

672
00:40:17.231 --> 00:40:20.450
your real consistent.
That's a thing too.
Cause you know how sometimes,

673
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.560
let's say you're real rigid one week and then the next layer is bad.

674
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.890
Or let's say you're,
you're really rigid like the whole year.
And then,

675
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.600
I don't know.
You're not,
you're feeling,
I don't know,

676
00:40:28.601 --> 00:40:30.520
you're hung over or something.
I don't know.
You partied or something.

677
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.950
You come to class as the teacher by the way.
Um,

678
00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.920
and then you're not as rigid that day.
Oh,
there's the little,

679
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.420
there's a little chink in your,

680
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.080
in your armor there and they'll kind of start to exploit it.
These kids,

681
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.650
which brings me to my second teacher,
not going to say his name,

682
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:48.730
he was in seventh grade though,
where this guy was just all over the place.

683
00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:51.690
Super easy to take advantage of this guy.
He's a music teacher.
Wait,

684
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.580
was he made you?
Yeah,
I think so.
I don't know.
I forget,

685
00:40:54.581 --> 00:40:58.080
but super easy to take advantage of this guy.
But kind of like,

686
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.760
he loses cool all the time and you know,

687
00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:05.050
it was just funny to see them react a lot of the time.
Right.
And the thing is,

688
00:41:05.051 --> 00:41:08.320
he didn't start like that.
He started just super nice,
just like,
hey look,

689
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:11.140
kind of like people would run over him and he'd be like,
Hey,
you know,

690
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.230
we don't have to,
he was just super nice,
but it wasn't consistent with anything.

691
00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:18.350
Then after awhile,
I think it was after like a few years,
um,

692
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:23.110
I hear that he's like really mean now.
Like he loses his temper all the time.

693
00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.740
I'm like,
what the heck is,

694
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.550
it goes back to just disappointing because freedom.
Right?

695
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.050
And if you would have held the line in the beginning and said,
no,
no,

696
00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:33.890
you don't act like that in stop.

697
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:39.730
<v 0>Then if he would have stopped at the minimal or at this small action that was</v>

698
00:41:42.591 --> 00:41:45.350
bad,
this,
this small,
bad behavior,
if he tightened that up,

699
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.370
then it would never get to bed.

700
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:48.200
Then he doesn't have to lose his temper and get crazy.

701
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.430
And I'm sure he's a nice guy.

702
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:52.530
I'm sure he's a positive guy and he had the highest hopes and expectations.

703
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.110
It's going back to the earlier subject.

704
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.920
He had the really high hopes that everyone's going to be in here to learn and,

705
00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.440
and open their minds.
And it's like,
no,

706
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:05.330
these kids are in here to shoot spitballs and stick pencils into the back of the

707
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:08.090
person sitting in front of them.
Right.

708
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.450
That's sort of it sort of it.

709
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.600
And when you realize that then you don't allow that middle bill behavior and

710
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:20.190
then they just don't get totally out of control.
Yeah man.
Hard,

711
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:24.770
hard work being a teacher.
Very much so.
Very much though.
Cause again like,
cause

712
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.520
it goes back to the thing men where were,

713
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:33.850
you only have like what an hour or something when the 45 minutes in a day and

714
00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:38.190
that's the only for like five days maximum for the week,
sometimes less.
You know,

715
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.260
you've got all of these whatever and then they go home or wherever and then they

716
00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:44.900
get their influences,
you know,
boom,
boom.
As they grow up,

717
00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:47.480
then they come back to your class with all that influence and it's like,
what,

718
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.050
what?
Now?
You know,
and you got to kind of find a way as the teacher,

719
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.700
not only to like get through to them,
just person to person,

720
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:59.870
but you've got to get all this material.
And if they don't like that material,

721
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.090
Oh man,
that's yet another task.
You know?
So again,
man,
if you have that,

722
00:43:04.091 --> 00:43:07.700
that structure in place and it's consistent and they know what to expect,

723
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:09.770
that's going to help because they have the scaffolding.

724
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.160
They don't know how to make it.
You know,
I got asked one time by a teacher,

725
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.450
it's kind of a similar question,
you know,

726
00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:17.210
I've done everything to get through to this person act.
They're just not,

727
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.130
they're just not getting in the game.
What do I do now?
And I was like,
well,

728
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.140
try a different way.
Trying to try a different way,
you know,

729
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:25.790
you didn't get through to them that way.
Try it a different way.

730
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:29.900
How can you get through it now?
Just like as a boss,
as a leader,

731
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:31.130
as a platoon commander,

732
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:35.480
if you've tried every single possible different way and you've got someone that

733
00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:38.030
just cannot do it or does not want to do it,

734
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:39.890
and they're negatively effecting everyone else,

735
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:42.560
then it's your responsibility as a leader to get rid of them,

736
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.373
get rid of them.

737
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.950
And had another conversation with a teacher one time who had kicked someone out

738
00:43:51.441 --> 00:43:56.410
of her school for fighting and I,

739
00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.530
and,
and this,
this person's a great person.
And a friend of mine,

740
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.790
she kicked someone out of the school and we met at a,
at a dinner,

741
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.930
and we were just talking and I said,
oh,
how's everything going?
She goes,
well,

742
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.740
you know,
I just kick this person out of school.
And I was like,
oh,

743
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:13.520
what's the situation?
And she swell,
you know,
it's this guy,
this kid,

744
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.420
and he's been a good kid.
He doesn't come from a great home,

745
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:20.650
but he got into a fight.
He hit another kid and I just have,
no,

746
00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.680
we can't have that at school at all.
And so me being a jerk,

747
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.920
I was like,
oh,
so you just destroyed his,
his life basically.
And she,

748
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.920
and you know,
and she's like,
what do you mean?
I go,
well,

749
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:35.070
if the kid doesn't have much of a home and he's not coming from a great family,

750
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:36.570
the only thing he has is your school.

751
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:38.700
And if you don't allow them in school now you kicked him out.

752
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:40.440
Where's he gonna end up?
I go,
did you,

753
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:42.930
did you already open up a space warm in prison somewhere?

754
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.440
Because that's where he's headed.
And I was just,
I was Kinda,

755
00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.440
I was being a total jerk,

756
00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:48.750
but I didn't really realize that until I saw her like getting emotional.

757
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.910
And I was like,
oh,
I'm sorry.

758
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:56.180
And so then we had the conversation and what was great was we talked and we went

759
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:01.800
through this conversation.
And because what I was saying,

760
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:04.170
even though I was being a jerk about it,
even though I was being kind of,

761
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.970
I don't know,
I wasn't being sarcastic,

762
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:08.790
I was just being really a really offensive because she's a friend,
you know?

763
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.870
And that's how I am.
Like one of your field team.
Yeah,
exactly.

764
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:16.140
Treating her like another seal.
But then we talked and I said,
look,

765
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:18.540
but even though I'm,
I don't mean to be a jerk,

766
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:23.040
I'm telling like what I believe to be the truth cracking.
But you're,

767
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.040
you have a great school,
you have this great opportunity for these kids.

768
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:29.520
And this kid who has been well behaved was,
oh,

769
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:30.990
and this was the other critical part.

770
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.810
The kid that he got in a fight with the kid that he punched,

771
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:37.080
he sucker punched the guy,
not soccer punch,
but threw the first punch.

772
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:40.380
The other kid was the class jerk,

773
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.440
the class picking on people and always misbehaving.

774
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.390
That kid didn't get kicked out of the school.

775
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:48.960
He wasn't going to get kicked out of the school because he didn't actually get

776
00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:53.580
involved in the physical violence and,
and so then I told her that too.
I said,

777
00:45:53.581 --> 00:45:53.731
look,

778
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:58.731
you got one kid that he finally broke mentally and you've got another kid that

779
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:02.490
just knows how to push people's buttons and he wanted him to hit him and now

780
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:06.690
you're kicking the kid out.
That actually probably should have done what he did.

781
00:46:06.691 --> 00:46:11.260
He,
that kid probably deserve to get punched in the face.
And,
and anyways,

782
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.670
after this long conversation,
you know,
she went back in the other,

783
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.940
the other key little thing that we talked about was I said,

784
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:22.380
it's okay for you as a leader to say,
hey look,
I made a mistake.
You know what?

785
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:23.970
I'm not kicking him out of the school.
You know why?

786
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.880
Because this other kid acted like a jerk.
This other kid harassed him,

787
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:31.080
this other kid did these other kid things and this child has been a well behaved

788
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:34.830
child and he lost his temper and that's human and we're going to keep them in

789
00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:35.790
school.
And she did that.

790
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:41.090
So my point is it's a hard job and

791
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:46.170
yeah,
that's my point.
Big Man.
And that's,

792
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:50.760
and that's another yet another thing that I think we've got to balance this in

793
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.900
regular society too,
but it's still this kid,
right?
For example,

794
00:46:54.901 --> 00:46:59.310
your example where the kid punched in the gut.
So boom,

795
00:46:59.311 --> 00:47:01.590
we have this incident.
So what do you do though?
Right?

796
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.890
It's like that's a problem if he,
and as far as problem solving goes,

797
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.420
you don't punish the kid.

798
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.690
You evaluate what happened and then you essentially help the kids.

799
00:47:09.691 --> 00:47:11.940
So he doesn't function.
Right?
Like some people,
they're like,
hey,

800
00:47:11.941 --> 00:47:14.760
we've got to punish this kid somehow give them detention or something.

801
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.340
And does that solve the problem?
Maybe.
Yeah.

802
00:47:17.341 --> 00:47:20.550
Maybe we actually teach someone to control their emotions.
Exactly right?

803
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.500
Like why'd you punch him?
By the way,
this guy did this.
Okay,

804
00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:23.760
there's another problem by the way.

805
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:29.290
So we've got to teach this kid to stop messing around.
Right.
That way,
you know?

806
00:47:29.291 --> 00:47:30.010
And then we got to teach

807
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.050
<v 1>this kid,
okay,
if you get,
you get messed around.
Yeah,</v>

808
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:32.650
<v 0>you're right.</v>

809
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:36.460
And sometimes the only way some kids learn a lesson is by being severely

810
00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:38.620
punished,
kicked out of a school,
whatever,
you know,

811
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.620
expelled or something like that.
But most cases,
what most cases,

812
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:44.620
what does that really teach them that,
that that's cool.
Doesn't care about them.

813
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.440
Right.
So that's a tough situation.
You know,

814
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.530
interestingly in where the warrior kid,

815
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.790
the next book that's coming out the hole,

816
00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.640
and I'm not going to give the whole story away,
but the,
the opening chapter,

817
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:06.330
young mark is in the principal's office and he's in the principal's office

818
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:11.290
because he threw a paper,
Mashiach Pumpkin at another kid's head.

819
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.240
Why did he do it?

820
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.050
Because he was frustrated because he got mad because the kid was picking on him

821
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:20.860
continually,
uh,
verbalizing verbal abuse.

822
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.980
And finally mark just got mad and he hooked a paper,

823
00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:26.830
Mashiach Pumpkin at the kid's head.

824
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:31.850
It bounced off the kid's head and hit and hit Ms. Carpenter at the phase two.

825
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.460
So we got sent to the office.
But anyways,
but the point is,
where I,

826
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:38.980
the reason I did that is because kids that are 11 years old,

827
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:41.590
they still lose their temper.
They haven't learned to control your temper yet.

828
00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:46.180
And so one of the themes in the new or your kid book is that a warrior has to

829
00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:48.040
learn to control their temper and control their emotions.

830
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.430
The lessons that we're talking about right now.
Yeah.
Interesting

831
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.380
<v 1>it off.
So thanks to the teachers out there,
big time man.</v>

832
00:48:55.381 --> 00:48:59.340
Cause man as a t and I've never been a teacher,
he asleep.

833
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.700
But I mean just even halfway imagining it man,

834
00:49:02.701 --> 00:49:05.700
you kind of care about these kids but you care about them all.
So,

835
00:49:05.701 --> 00:49:08.010
and then you have all the,
the whole spectrum of them.

836
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:12.040
You have the kid who's like the teacher's bit as far as the other kids are

837
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:14.550
concerned.
But meanwhile you love that kid cause man,

838
00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:17.640
he's picking up what you're putting down and he's listening and he's giving you

839
00:49:17.641 --> 00:49:19.980
apples and whatnot.
Then you have on the other side,

840
00:49:19.981 --> 00:49:23.340
you have the one that won't listen to anything disrupting your class,
you know?

841
00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:27.210
But you want that kid like of course you want him to leave you like stop messing

842
00:49:27.211 --> 00:49:29.640
up my whole thing.
But you're like,
yeah man.

843
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:33.030
Cause like when you know how you teach someone something and you see a music,

844
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.691
oh man,

845
00:49:33.691 --> 00:49:37.860
that's the best as any kind of capacity that you know as far as the role that

846
00:49:37.861 --> 00:49:39.570
you play,
like in Jujitsu or something like that.

847
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:43.460
Even like another adult because they're all the same.
Right.
Actually,

848
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:47.280
I think kids,
well,
there's assume there's a fundamental human characteristic,

849
00:49:47.281 --> 00:49:50.400
I believe that makes you want to help other people.
Yeah.

850
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.240
It feels like you're just going to influence like living on or something like

851
00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:57.600
that.
I don't know,
but man,
so it's like,
then it's like,

852
00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:01.830
yet that's yet another thing you got to deal with as a teacher.
You know,

853
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:05.760
because you're committed men.
It's like shoretel.

854
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:11.670
Anyway,
next question.
Question.
I'm a firefighter.
Speaking of which,

855
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.980
I'm a fighter firefighter in Australia and in the time I've been in this job,

856
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.970
I've been to several jobs
that were very challenging.

857
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.840
I've entered burning homes to extinguish fires and search for residents and

858
00:50:24.841 --> 00:50:25.620
their pets.

859
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:29.660
I searched for victims during times flood and help people evacuate their homes.

860
00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:31.220
In terms of natural disasters,

861
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:35.430
I've attended car crashes and cut victims from vehicles and pulled deceased

862
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.900
people from others.
I also know that I'm not alone.

863
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.590
I am aware of the fact that while I've been doing this,

864
00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.790
countless firefighters were on the globe war thousands of times braver than me,

865
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:51.260
and I've done things that the vast majority of the population would not be

866
00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:52.220
capable of,

867
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:58.100
and that doesn't even acknowledge the courage of our police and paramedics in

868
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:01.640
our military who step up day after day to do what has to be done because of,

869
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.610
if not me,
then who?
My question is this,

870
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:08.990
how do you suggest those and the front line deal with the trivial issues at
home,

871
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.630
I attended a very severe car accident,

872
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:15.740
a head on collision with a school bus full of children and another car.
Thankful.

873
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.500
Thankfully all the children in the school bus broke.
Okay.

874
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:21.980
But it took us three hours to cut the driver from the car and she had very

875
00:51:21.981 --> 00:51:26.450
serious injuries and was airlifted to a hospital.
When I got home that night,

876
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:31.451
I was confronted by an upset girlfriend wanting to talk about some extra

877
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.430
extraordinarily trivial issue,

878
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:38.110
which I struggled to listen to the whole time.
And she was talking.

879
00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.180
I just kept thinking about the job and making sure I,

880
00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:44.360
I'd done everything I possibly could have for the driver,

881
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.600
but I was also aware of the fact that my fiancee's problems are important to

882
00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:54.320
her,
so I need to be supportive.
I listen for as long as I could.

883
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:58.070
I listen for as long as I could.
Then unfortunately,
I just said,

884
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:59.840
your day could have been a lot worse.

885
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:03.200
No one spent three hours cutting you out of a car,
so be thankful.

886
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:05.180
I know I can't be alone on this.

887
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.900
I know police paramedics in the military would be suffering the same thing.

888
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.380
How do you suggest is the best way to deal with this

889
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.410
<v 0>check?
So</v>

890
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.380
it was
always,

891
00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:28.100
always my goal to protect my family from darkness and evil in the world.

892
00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:38.490
That includes these kinds of things.

893
00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:42.720
You want to shield them from this.
Now this doesn't mean to keep them oblivious.

894
00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:48.270
You don't want them thinking that though the world that you've created for them

895
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.310
that's well protected and secure.

896
00:52:50.311 --> 00:52:53.100
You don't want them thinking that that's the way the whole world is.

897
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.480
You don't want them thinking that,

898
00:52:54.481 --> 00:52:59.481
but I sure didn't throw this kind of stuff at my family on a regular basis.

899
00:52:59.641 --> 00:53:03.210
But I took pride and I think that that's the answer here.

900
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:08.390
Take Pride in letting your family or your loved ones live in worlds where

901
00:53:10.141 --> 00:53:12.630
they're trivial issues.

902
00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:13.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

903
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.320
<v 0>Are the most important thing in their world,</v>

904
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:18.890
the most impactful thing in the world for them.

905
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.800
Okay.
So that's,
that's number one.
And if you get yourself a little bit of,

906
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:28.470
of satisfaction every time your,

907
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:33.660
your significant other complains that um,
you know,
the,

908
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.590
the ice machine isn't really working up to full speed.
It's really horrible.

909
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.700
Right?
You should be,
you should be proud of think of yourself.
Yeah.

910
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.370
Well you know what,
let me,
let me take a look at it.

911
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.070
Maybe there's a kink in the water line.
I don't know.

912
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:50.940
But we'll try and get that thing up to speed so you can have cold drinks.

913
00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.910
Cause that's where I want your world to be,
right?

914
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:58.690
I want you to have plenty of ice,
so for your drinks or whatever.
Uh,

915
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.600
so that's,
that's it.
If you can give,

916
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:05.490
you can put your family in that kind of a protected environment.

917
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.350
You should be proud of it and you should be.

918
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.260
And the way they indicate that to you,
they don't say,

919
00:54:10.261 --> 00:54:12.780
hey thank you for letting me live in a protected environment.

920
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:15.180
They don't say that to you.
They,
they're in the environment.

921
00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:17.310
They don't even know that they're in it.
The way they,

922
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:19.890
the way they let you know that they're in that environment is when they,

923
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.940
when they complain about trivial things.
So that's number one.

924
00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:28.980
The other thing is try and try and see things from other people's perspectives.

925
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:34.140
You know,
in,
in this case,
my,

926
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.680
my wife's right to my,

927
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:41.710
my wife would say things is a big deal to her and for her it was a big deal and

928
00:54:42.001 --> 00:54:44.730
like I just said,
I wanted it to be a big deal for her.

929
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:47.970
And also I'll tell you what we're talking about firefighters and military and

930
00:54:47.971 --> 00:54:52.020
police,
but this goes to other non uniformed jobs as well.

931
00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.470
If,
if you can leave your work at work cause you think some,
you know,

932
00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:01.410
every job there's stresses at every job and you're out there grinding and you're

933
00:55:01.411 --> 00:55:04.560
in trouble with the boss or you're trying to get a project fee figured out and

934
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:08.130
you've got all this stress coming down on you or you've lost money or you've got

935
00:55:08.131 --> 00:55:10.800
a huge deal on the table or whatever the case may be.

936
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:17.450
If you can isolate your family from that as much as you can.

937
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.970
And I'm not saying to an unhealthy level where you're just not telling them

938
00:55:20.971 --> 00:55:24.180
what's going on,
but bear the burden man,

939
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:27.640
bear the burden of that you,

940
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:30.360
that you hold to protect your family.

941
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:37.010
So yeah.
Um,
that's what I think.
That's what I think we,

942
00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:42.020
we do our best to protect our family and our loved ones from the darkness,

943
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.000
the pressure,
the stress,
the evil in the world.
Again,

944
00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:49.290
you don't make them oblivious.

945
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:52.590
You don't disconnect from them in order to do that.

946
00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.800
But you shield him from it and you bear the burden yourself so that they don't

947
00:55:55.801 --> 00:55:59.040
have to bear it as much.
Again,

948
00:55:59.041 --> 00:56:01.020
you don't want your kids growing up to be spoiled.

949
00:56:01.021 --> 00:56:03.030
You don't want your wife to be saying,

950
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:06.480
if I don't get have a latte this morning,

951
00:56:06.481 --> 00:56:10.470
I will absolutely not even.
Right.

952
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:14.370
You don't want to be married to that person.
Yeah.
Not even.

953
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.200
I did that pretty good,
didn't I?

954
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.000
One of my middle daughter's like the funniest person ever and she can do all

955
00:56:21.001 --> 00:56:24.160
these crazy,
I'm stealing material right there

956
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:29.200
<v 1>because she'll do that.
She'll say,
she'll say God is so,
Oh my God.</v>

957
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.900
It's not even,
you know,
she's kidding.

958
00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.690
Cause she knows that there's human beings like that in the world that say not

959
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.340
even,
there's nothing at the end of it.

960
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.920
I think that might be something new that's not evil.
You know,

961
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:46.600
I've heard I can't even,
I can't even,
oh,
it's the same thing.
Same thing.
Yeah.

962
00:56:46.601 --> 00:56:49.780
Some updated new age is just a different angle on it.

963
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.960
But yeah.
Hey,
thanks for all.
Thanks for doing all that hard work,
man.
That's,
um,

964
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:58.240
that's awesome.
I know,
I see firefighters,
police officers,

965
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:02.380
military people all the time.
I hear from all the time and yeah,

966
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:04.390
try and shield your family as much as you can.

967
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:07.660
Don't drag them down the down into the darkness whether you,
yeah,

968
00:57:07.661 --> 00:57:11.230
it seems like a good one.
Take pride in it.
That's what I was going to.
Exactly.

969
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:12.730
What is the thing it's like take pride in.

970
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:16.340
It's like embracing the role has luck to captain kind of thing.
You know,

971
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.650
where it's like,
yeah.
You know,
wife's mad about,
you know,

972
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:25.680
they put cream in our coffee and she asked for non fat milk from thankful.

973
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.760
Um,
and you know,
whatever.
And she's pissed.
And meanwhile,
you know,

974
00:57:30.761 --> 00:57:34.180
you just pulled a lady out for three hours by the way,

975
00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:39.160
bus and car crashed head on collision.
So is he,
you know,
you embrace the role.

976
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.430
It's like,
okay,
you know,
boom,
I'm dealing off one second.

977
00:57:42.431 --> 00:57:46.210
I'm dealing with straight up life and death and kids and accidents and tragedy.

978
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:50.200
And then one second later I'm dealing with essentially nothing.
Right.

979
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.230
But it's my wife feelings.
That's what I'm dealing with.

980
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:56.380
My wife feel I'm not dealing with nonfat milk versus cream.

981
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.290
I'm not dealing with that.
I'm dealing with my wife's feelings.

982
00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:02.530
And that's part of the job too.
So you can't just be like,
Hey,

983
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:04.240
I'm going to do my job one second.

984
00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:07.750
I'm doing my job really good and the next second I'm not going to do it.
So good.

985
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:08.471
You can't do that.

986
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:11.830
Embrace the role as the guy who gets the job done regardless of how big,

987
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:16.630
how small.
So,
so as a husband,

988
00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:20.590
this is where I can speak from because I'd been a husband for eight years,

989
00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:26.110
um,
successfully because I'm currently husband too.
Uh,
so there'd be,

990
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:30.140
you know how like people have little things,
please,
please,
Ciao.

991
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:36.450
Cause I need that info anyway.
But she'll,
so you know how you know people,

992
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.190
they'll,
they'll tell you something and then you'll be like,
wait,

993
00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:41.950
what did you mean by that?
You're kind of offended.
Like,
are you like,

994
00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:44.920
are you kind of digging at me?
Or something like that,
you know,

995
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:48.840
like that kind of stuff.
Even though,
you know,
kind of,
they were right.

996
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.510
Like that was a little passive aggressive little comment kind of thing.

997
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.870
So every once in a while when I experienced that,

998
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.690
not to say it happens all the time,
but if it ever happened,

999
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:02.660
what I do to kind of combat the anger cause Bro,
I'm the king.

1000
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:04.450
I'm the kind of more like if there's like a,

1001
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.170
so your same password aggressive from your wife.
Yes.

1002
00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:09.670
And what you would do to combat the anger would be,

1003
00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:13.870
it would be trying to move this story.
Bracing.
No,
it's relevant to this though.

1004
00:59:13.871 --> 00:59:18.160
And important.
I think it helps.
I totally helps where I embraced the role of the,

1005
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.040
I don't know,
for lack of better than the captain,
you know,
embrace the role.

1006
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.010
Captain wear

1007
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.200
<v 3>shirts,
he's passive aggressive,
whatever,
you know,</v>

1008
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:28.430
maybe I'll overtime I'll start to understand more or whatever.
But so I

1009
00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:35.810
envisioned myself as superman and her passive aggressive comments or bullets and

1010
00:59:35.811 --> 00:59:39.500
they were just bouncing off of me.
Just like bullets off.
Superman continue.

1011
00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:40.640
That's cool.
That's cool.

1012
00:59:40.641 --> 00:59:43.760
Until the fact that if you don't react and she's going to escalate,

1013
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:45.590
she wants some kind of reaction out of you.
Yeah.

1014
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:48.860
So sometimes you have to give them some kind of reaction.
Otherwise,

1015
00:59:48.861 --> 00:59:53.030
they'll continue to escalate to a point where you do react.
Yes.
Yeah.

1016
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:57.150
So I mean that will all a while ago.
Yeah,
no reaction is,

1017
00:59:57.151 --> 00:59:59.780
is not always good.
Right.
So,

1018
00:59:59.781 --> 01:00:02.780
and I don't gotta say you gotta say the bullet hits you and you got her to say,

1019
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.850
oh,
that,
that bullet hurt.
Oh,
um,
yeah.
I,

1020
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.380
I should be a little more careful with the bullets are flying around.

1021
01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:13.250
That's how I need to be a little bit more,
you know,
careful of these bullets.

1022
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:16.070
They can really hurt me.
Right.
Be careful,
but see how your,

1023
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:19.690
your tone and stuff is like there's no anger there,
but the,

1024
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:22.880
so that's what I meant.
I meant it's just to combat the anger,
not the,

1025
01:00:22.881 --> 01:00:25.940
the problem solving thing.
That's a whole nother thing as far as I'm concerned.

1026
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.340
Like if she's passive aggressive or mad about,
I don't know,

1027
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:32.830
because I put the dish away when it was wet and you know,
before it dried it,

1028
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:35.300
what it was,
by the way.
But I'm just saying if it's,

1029
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.420
that's a whole different thing.
So if I,

1030
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.610
anger wise,
the bullets bounce off of me.
Boom.
I don't get angry,

1031
01:00:43.611 --> 01:00:46.260
then I can start addressing those issues.
The ones that you're talking about,

1032
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.610
but I mean to combat the straight up anger,
keep your emotions in check,

1033
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.060
stifling like or insults or bouncing off of me like Superman.

1034
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:58.130
It helps sometimes most of the time.
All right,
next question

1035
01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:00.563
<v 1>Jocko.</v>

1036
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:04.920
I'm leading a project that involves a few of my team members and about 10 other

1037
01:01:04.921 --> 01:01:07.110
team members from other functions.

1038
01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:10.140
The project has high visibility in the large organization,

1039
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.700
over 10 billion in revenue that I worked for us.

1040
01:01:12.701 --> 01:01:14.730
So the pressures to execute is high.

1041
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.570
We have had some issues with cross functional team members meeting their

1042
01:01:18.571 --> 01:01:22.050
deliverables and keeping the,
to keep the project on path,

1043
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.340
but we're pushing sometimes dragging everyone along to make things happen.

1044
01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.170
Recently on a formal review with the leadership team,
the question was asked,

1045
01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:33.270
why is this project behind?

1046
01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:36.690
I'm a firm believer in providing protection for your team.

1047
01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.920
So my response was they're excuses,
but to be honest,
they're just excuses.

1048
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.530
So we're doing everything we can to get it back on track,

1049
01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.190
trying to take the brunt of the performance miss on my shoulders.

1050
01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:51.390
No additional comments were made in that meeting and it ended.

1051
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:56.280
My boss was on the call and pull me aside the next day and voiced his opinion

1052
01:01:56.281 --> 01:01:59.490
that I should not hesitate to call out the lack of performance on the other

1053
01:01:59.491 --> 01:02:01.230
functional team members.

1054
01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.610
His thought is that doing so does not allow the leadership to coach,
mentor,

1055
01:02:05.611 --> 01:02:08.640
and or fix issues correctly.
I understand this logic,

1056
01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:14.010
but I don't feel that true leaders point fingers or throw others under the bus.

1057
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.300
Your thoughts would be,

1058
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.980
<v 3>okay,
so first of all,
your boss</v>

1059
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.830
<v 0>has a little bit of a point,
but it's,
but it's also,</v>

1060
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.500
there's some limitations to it.
Number one,
you know,

1061
01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:29.910
our goal as a leader is to build relationships with people,

1062
01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:33.150
accomplish the mission,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
So if,

1063
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:35.423
if we,

1064
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:40.670
if we start just calling people out in front of a senior leadership on a call,

1065
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.460
well,
are you forming a good relationship with people?
The answer is no.

1066
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:48.110
You're actually making them mad and they're saying they're there.

1067
01:02:48.111 --> 01:02:50.190
The first thing you're going to do when you call them out as call,

1068
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.910
call you up as soon as the call ends and they're going to say,
dude,

1069
01:02:53.911 --> 01:02:56.250
why don't you tell me that?
Why are you telling me this in front of the boss?

1070
01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.080
So here's the deal.

1071
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.680
You should not ever have to throw someone under the bus without plenty of

1072
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:05.520
warning,
right.

1073
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:10.980
Without plenty of them to to know and expect and be prepared with an answer.

1074
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:14.190
That's what you should be doing.
It's kind of like that escalation of counseling.

1075
01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:17.310
Then I talk about like you start off by just saying,
hey man,
you were late.

1076
01:03:17.311 --> 01:03:19.200
You know what's up and you go all the way to like,
okay,

1077
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:23.940
if you're late again and there's a whole slow escalation or depending on how

1078
01:03:23.941 --> 01:03:27.540
fast you need to get it done,
but with this one,
it's the same thing.
You say,
Hey,

1079
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:29.790
echo,
you know you're,
you're part of the project.
What do you need help right now?

1080
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:33.720
What's going on you,
you don't seem up to speed.
And then it,
then we escalate to,

1081
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:36.480
hey echo,
you just missed another,
you know,
target date,

1082
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:39.180
this is the second target date you've missed.
We get,

1083
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:41.580
we had a problem and then it's hey echo,

1084
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:42.930
do you not have the supports that you need?

1085
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.700
What do you need because this isn't working out.

1086
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.800
And then it's the only way I'm going to be able to do this.

1087
01:03:47.801 --> 01:03:50.040
So we got to bring us up to the boss.
I think you need more people.

1088
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:53.940
And then that's another important thing is,
is you frame it,

1089
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.840
you frame it in such a way that is not hurting them,

1090
01:03:57.870 --> 01:04:02.310
but it's actually helping them.
So I might say on the call,
Hey,
you know,
uh,
uh,

1091
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:05.460
Alpha team is working really hard but they need more x,
Y,

1092
01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:07.210
and Z to get the job done.
So,
you know,

1093
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:11.750
I think we should give echo and Alpha team more x,
y,
and Z.
Okay.

1094
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:16.560
Cause he missed a date and I know they're working hard or you say,

1095
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:21.180
you know,
I think we need more people allocated over to Alpha team.

1096
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:24.390
I think they've been over tasks and they could use some support.

1097
01:04:24.391 --> 01:04:25.740
So let's give them some more people.

1098
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.800
Or you can even say I'm moving to people from my team over to Alpha team

1099
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:33.300
temporarily to give them some additional capacity over there cause they're task

1100
01:04:33.301 --> 01:04:34.830
is more demanding than what I've been assigned.

1101
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.970
So all of those things are letting everyone know,

1102
01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:41.670
bringing the problem to the attention of the,

1103
01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:45.990
of the group so that now you say,
actually Jocko,
here's what's going on.

1104
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.490
I don't need two more people.
I need four nor more people or you know,
you say,

1105
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.210
okay,
um,
hey,
I don't need anyone else.
If you're one of those people,

1106
01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:57.450
the ego gets in the way and you say,
I don't need anyone else.
And we will say,

1107
01:04:57.451 --> 01:05:01.470
okay,
well you missed two time marks,
you miss two,
you know,
dates.
Well,

1108
01:05:01.471 --> 01:05:05.130
I don't need any more people.
Okay.
Okay,
well let's see if you can,

1109
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.320
if you can make this next,
next date,
then I guess you don't,

1110
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:10.730
but if you miss another day,
well then I guess you need more people.
So we,

1111
01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:14.730
we moved through it like that.
So yeah,
you do have to discuss things you can do.

1112
01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:17.010
You can discuss these things,
you can bring them up in a way.

1113
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.740
They are not offensive to two people.

1114
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:24.040
They don't throw them under the bus,
but they do however,

1115
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:30.190
signify that the buses around and that if we aren't careful,

1116
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:33.310
you might get hit by the bus and you got to give people plenty of warning.

1117
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:35.770
It's the same thing with same thing I've talked about in the past with skipping

1118
01:05:35.771 --> 01:05:36.940
the chain of command.
You know,

1119
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:41.140
you shouldn't be skipping the chain of command on less unless you've given so

1120
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:45.750
much warning and you do it in such a way that you know,
they uh,

1121
01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.410
they actually know what's going to happen.

1122
01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:49.270
They expect is gonna happen and they kind of agree with you.

1123
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:53.370
So be careful with those things.
Again,
if someone's doing something immoral,

1124
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.090
illegal,
unethical,

1125
01:05:55.091 --> 01:05:57.190
and you skip the chain of command because you've already tried to solve with

1126
01:05:57.191 --> 01:05:59.680
them and they're not doing it well,
then you might have to just go get some.

1127
01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.860
Cause if you're,
you're culpable if you don't.

1128
01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:08.290
So formed good relationships with people.
Don't form antagonistic relationships.

1129
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.040
You know,
I just add a conversation with a guy when I was in,
in Boston,

1130
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.540
similar situation,
but you know,
he,
he was saying there was a situation he was in

1131
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:22.540
and what he said was politically it was,

1132
01:06:22.541 --> 01:06:25.030
he didn't want to address it because politically if he dressed it,

1133
01:06:25.031 --> 01:06:27.970
it might explode.
And I said,
well,
if,
if the,
if it addressed,

1134
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
if you address the situation,
like a classic case,

1135
01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:33.130
I know how to do this more efficiently,

1136
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:38.080
this experienced person doesn't want to try my method.
Okay.

1137
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:41.500
And I said,
well,
why don't you present them with the method and say,
um,
you know,

1138
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.530
hey,
here's,
here's how we should do this.
And he says,
no,

1139
01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:47.710
I don't want to do that because the person that I want to get to use the new

1140
01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:52.300
method is really close friends with the boss and [inaudible] form that bad

1141
01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:54.000
relationship and it's going to be bad.
And I go,

1142
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.800
would that affect your overall mission to your ability to do the mission,

1143
01:06:56.801 --> 01:06:59.560
to have bad relationships,
not only with your immediate boss,

1144
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:02.320
both with your boss's boss,
and he's like,
yes it would,
and I go,

1145
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:06.010
then it doesn't sound like a good plan.
There you go.
There's your answer.

1146
01:07:06.011 --> 01:07:09.520
Because even though you have a better method,
and you might say like a direct,

1147
01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:14.170
a person with a direct train of thought mindset would say,
no.
You Go,

1148
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.380
you tell the bosses boss that this is the method and we're going to be more

1149
01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:18.370
efficient if we do it this way.

1150
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:22.120
Well now you've just exploded a bomb on yourself and it's going to be bad.

1151
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.110
So I gave him the classic,
Hey,
why don't you say,
listen,

1152
01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.000
I think I've thought of a new method.

1153
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.370
I think we might be able to get some efficiencies out of it,

1154
01:07:30.371 --> 01:07:35.080
but since I'm not as experienced and don't know the systems as well as you do,

1155
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.170
I would love to get your feedback on how it works.

1156
01:07:38.171 --> 01:07:41.460
I think that you're the only one that could really know how to do this
concealer,

1157
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.900
so experienced and smart and brilliant,

1158
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:48.901
all that stuff and awesome and you try and feed him some of the new methods so

1159
01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:52.600
that he can try it and either say,
yeah,
this stuff's pretty good.

1160
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:55.570
Or you know what?
There's some things that you didn't realize,

1161
01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:59.920
young buck and we've got to get them fixed.
So check,

1162
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:05.140
try and form relationships,
positive relationships,

1163
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.320
not antagonistic relationships.
If you throw people under the bus,

1164
01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:13.040
you're not forming good relationships.
Check especially that surprise on.

1165
01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.920
That's rough.
Yeah.

1166
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:21.140
<v 3>Next question,
to give you a little backstory,</v>

1167
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.760
I tried my first Jujitsu class last week and during the rolling part of the

1168
01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:30.140
class happened to get matched up with another white belt who has been going to

1169
01:08:30.141 --> 01:08:32.720
the gym for over a year.
During the rule,

1170
01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:37.280
I got thrashed around a bit and tap to what I've been told was called a cross

1171
01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.790
collar choke.
I ended up getting geeky burns on my neck,

1172
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:45.791
MFAs the game right there as well as getting my lip split,

1173
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:51.110
gets up every train Muay Thai and sparked for a couple of years.

1174
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:54.650
I'm used to physical pain and that's,
and that didn't exactly bother me.

1175
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:57.680
What did bother me when some marks that that were left on my face,

1176
01:08:57.710 --> 01:09:00.200
which in addition to just not looking good,

1177
01:09:00.201 --> 01:09:03.950
I can't have because my job requires that I meet with clients face to face in

1178
01:09:03.951 --> 01:09:07.040
these clients might make judgments and assume I was in a street fight.

1179
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:12.020
I also think the white belt I was rolling with went a little too hard on me,

1180
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:16.040
but I don't know enough about Jujitsu to determine whether or not people go full

1181
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:20.030
speed.
Every role.
I know that in when we tie box inboxing,

1182
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:23.810
normally we try to tone down the intensity level.
For newbies,

1183
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:28.160
especially the first time they spar.
So my questions are one,

1184
01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:31.970
does Jujitsu normally leave you with lots of marks or scrapes on your face?

1185
01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.440
I don't mind occasionally getting them but can't go home with them after every

1186
01:09:36.441 --> 01:09:39.590
class.
That's it.
Or first question.
Second question,

1187
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:43.820
do people normally go full speed in rolling and if not,

1188
01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:48.530
how do I get him to stop without sounding like a giant wimp?
Okay.

1189
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:52.460
So number one,
does BJJ normally leave you with Watson marks?

1190
01:09:52.461 --> 01:09:56.900
Description of your face?
The answer is no.
Not Normally.
Will you?
Occasionally,

1191
01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.350
yes you will.
Actually,
you will get dinged up.
You'll get black eyes,

1192
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:05.210
you'll split your lab,
your have ghee,
Barnes on your face yet scratchy.
Yeah.
That,

1193
01:10:05.211 --> 01:10:09.110
that'll,
that's going to happen.
Did,
but it's not regular.
It's not regular.

1194
01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:14.111
It's what do you think once every three weeks on your face and neck?

1195
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:17.570
Yeah,
once every three weeks.
Every three weeks,
four weeks.

1196
01:10:17.571 --> 01:10:20.750
I want to see maybe once a month you have something visible while you're wearing

1197
01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:23.180
a suit.
Presenting to clients,

1198
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:27.230
given the normal amount of training,
you know,

1199
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:32.510
turning wants to trade up competitive,
you know,
mode two times a day,

1200
01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.650
three days a week in a door.
Of course.
Yeah.
It's more but normal training.
Yeah.

1201
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:40.280
Um,
and then the next question is,

1202
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.400
do people normally go full speed and rolling?
And if not,

1203
01:10:43.401 --> 01:10:46.100
how do I get him to stop without sounding like a giant wimp?

1204
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.170
So this is actually funny because if you think about it,
think about this.

1205
01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:56.620
He's kind of complaining in a way that the other person was going to hard,

1206
01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.793
right?
Yes.

1207
01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:03.490
And yet he didn't tap to this until his face was scraped and got thrashed

1208
01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:06.111
around.

1209
01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:11.111
So what I'm saying is it takes two people to escalate a situation and without

1210
01:11:11.631 --> 01:11:14.190
knowing it,
he escalated the situation

1211
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.360
<v 0>cause he resisted as hard as he could.</v>

1212
01:11:15.361 --> 01:11:17.760
He's only been training for a day and he's going to,

1213
01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:20.730
they're fighting like crazy instead of just relaxing and being like,
hey,

1214
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:23.070
you know,
I've only been true.
I've never trained before.
Oh,

1215
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.950
you're going to choke me out.
Cool.
Yeah.
You know,

1216
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:28.530
instead of learning and relaxing,
uh,
you,

1217
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:33.560
you allow yourself to get caught up in the primal instinct of fighting for your

1218
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:37.390
life,
which is what happens when people start.

1219
01:11:37.391 --> 01:11:41.790
You did to the primal instinct takes over and it's also ego and,

1220
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.500
and the will to win,
it takes over.

1221
01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:47.130
And they just want to go so hard and they can't believe that this little guy's

1222
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:51.170
joking me,
that mock gonna let it happen.
So that is actually your ego and,

1223
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:55.480
and it is also your ego.
And I tell people all the time,

1224
01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.930
one of the main reasons people get hurt in Jujitsu's because of ego.

1225
01:11:58.030 --> 01:12:01.470
And you either don't tap number one,
which is just stupid,

1226
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:03.750
or you,

1227
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:08.040
you don't say no to rolling with people that you know you should enroll with.

1228
01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.940
That's it.
And when I say don't tap,
it's like,
it has to do with,

1229
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.880
with the way you're rolling too,
right?
I mean,

1230
01:12:14.881 --> 01:12:19.860
if you're just going to fight everything so super hard because you want to win,

1231
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:23.100
well then you're gonna end up having a much higher chance of getting injured.

1232
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:27.390
So I fall into that sometimes too.
You know,

1233
01:12:27.391 --> 01:12:30.720
if I'm like I had a hurt knee the other day and you know,

1234
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:35.721
maybe like a month ago my knee was a little hurt and I was rolling but I hadn't

1235
01:12:36.331 --> 01:12:39.840
been doing a lot of standup and all of a sudden I was escalating with whoever

1236
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:44.870
would like hey Andy or someone and all of a sudden I was standing and I didn't

1237
01:12:45.121 --> 01:12:49.410
want to give up the position.
Right.
And as I'm standing there I'm like,

1238
01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:51.220
oh this is your ego right now you,
you,

1239
01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:54.630
you have no reason to sit here and fight on the feet where your,

1240
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:59.750
where your knee is actually bothering you just don't be an idiot and just pull

1241
01:13:00.361 --> 01:13:05.010
guard and,
and so no big deal.
Right.
Okay.
Pull guard,
whatever.

1242
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.470
Did you pull guard?
I did.
Yeah.

1243
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:09.540
Cause I was realized I was being stupid and if I'm there I am,

1244
01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:12.720
I've been healing and I'm almost good to go and now I'm going to jeopardize it

1245
01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:17.580
because I just,
I want to stand up and get some stupid stupid.

1246
01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.150
So that is what you have to do.
You have to put your ego in check.

1247
01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:22.530
And that is a huge part of Jujitsu.

1248
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.780
That's one of the things that makes you Jitsu so impactful.
It's,

1249
01:13:24.781 --> 01:13:27.390
it's so humbling.
Your ego can't withstand it.

1250
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:31.140
And despite how hard you fought against this guy and this question,

1251
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.750
that guy was still gonna tap you out.
You didn't stand a chance.

1252
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.730
You didn't stand a chance.
Yeah.

1253
01:13:35.731 --> 01:13:39.210
My first class versus the guy who had been ruling for over a year,
over a year.

1254
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:43.860
You don't stand a chance.
You don't stand a chance.
You don't.
So what,

1255
01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.590
what you want to do is you want to learn.
So put your ego aside,
relax,

1256
01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.490
talk.
And if you get someone that's going so you don't want to sound like a wimp,

1257
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:55.440
that's what gets you hurt.

1258
01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:00.600
What's cool is when somebody is 58 years old and they're on the mat and some

1259
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:06.230
some 22 year old blue belt that weighs 80 pounds more than them says who your

1260
01:14:06.381 --> 01:14:10.200
one role.
And the older dude says,
no man,
I'm good.

1261
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:12.070
I'm not rolling with you.
Because

1262
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.920
<v 3>their ego is in check and they realize that's not going to get him anywhere.</v>

1263
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:18.580
Yeah.
Rolling with this big idiot.
Yeah.
There's not going to get him anywhere.

1264
01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:21.160
So they're saying,
no,
I don't want to run with you.
Their Egos,
fine.

1265
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:24.340
They get their over it.
So put your ego in check.

1266
01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:28.450
You won't get marked up a lot and people,
people will go full speed.

1267
01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:33.070
If you're going full speed,
that's the answer.
The harder you go,

1268
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.570
the harder the other person's going.

1269
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.570
You don't want to go in there and get to a level seven death match with every

1270
01:14:37.571 --> 01:14:40.270
person you roll with,
you're going to get them.
You're going to get them,

1271
01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:43.140
especially with people that are around your level.
Yeah.

1272
01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.780
Because if the person's a purple belt or a brown belt or a black belt,

1273
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.080
you can go nuts on them.
It doesn't even matter to them.

1274
01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:52.180
They're just going to be laughing at you.
Although you can,
you can offend them.

1275
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:55.570
And I've seen some black belts and some good Jujitsu,

1276
01:14:55.870 --> 01:15:00.870
Jujitsu practitioners that get offended if someone attacks them with fury,

1277
01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:05.230
like they have a chance and you go,
okay,
cool.
You want to be like that,

1278
01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.020
I'm going to smash you.
And I've done that from time to time.

1279
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:10.570
You know where someone just there,
they're in there,
they're like,

1280
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:14.320
they think it's their day or whatever and they think they're going to get you

1281
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.930
and you go,
oh,
you're not going to get me,
but now you've,

1282
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.950
now you're going to get God and is not going to be fun.
Yeah.

1283
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:22.570
That tends to happen though.

1284
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.040
Not if you're well within the confines of just Jujitsu stuff like,
um,

1285
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:30.610
but if you start to drift towards the edges of etiquette,

1286
01:15:30.611 --> 01:15:32.930
so like let's say like if,
if it,
you know,

1287
01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.040
I'm going to spar with you in today's my day and I start stiff arming you hard

1288
01:15:38.381 --> 01:15:41.440
and doing that kind of stuff.
Stuff that's,
it's legal,
but it's like,
yeah,

1289
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:42.520
for sure you shouldn't,
you know,

1290
01:15:42.521 --> 01:15:45.010
it's like that kind of stuff that'll make a higher belt med,

1291
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.670
I think when you are correct,
you are correct.
It just someone going,

1292
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.720
just someone going level nine psycho.
Yeah.
Instead of just being,

1293
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:56.230
oh you want to roll,
hey,
cool.
You,
hey,
we're going to use strength.
I get that.

1294
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:58.180
I get that we're going to use strength.
That's the way it works.

1295
01:15:58.181 --> 01:16:00.850
That's part of the game.
That's why we work out.
Right.
I get that.

1296
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:02.560
We're going to go fast.
I get that.
That's cool.

1297
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:05.230
But you want to just go level nine psycho.
Cool.

1298
01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:09.970
That's not going to work out good.
Yeah.
And just cruise man.
Have a good time.

1299
01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:14.370
Yeah.
Nothing wrong with that.
I'm a huge advocate of cruising for sure.
Um,

1300
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:15.540
but I'm,
I'm,

1301
01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:20.590
I support like guys going heart for sure.
Even like young guys,

1302
01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:23.220
I mean like with where this guy,
but,

1303
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.210
but the thing is this guy is saying how does he stop it?
Yeah.

1304
01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.800
The way you stop it is by relaxing.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1305
01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:33.070
I'm full supportive people going hard,
you know,
and I go hard.
Right.

1306
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.330
I go,
I guess you're right.
Yeah.
I mean I trained hard for sure,
but um,

1307
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.640
like if I don't know you yeah.
And you want to just go level nine,
cool.

1308
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:46.340
We'll go level mine.
But you know,
yeah,
it's all,

1309
01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:51.400
it's all the spectrum of,
of Jujitsu.
And also I get it though,

1310
01:16:51.401 --> 01:16:54.880
like,
you know,
he doesn't want marks all over his face all the time for,

1311
01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:58.390
I mean to me you don't even have to say because of work,
you can just say,

1312
01:16:58.391 --> 01:17:01.510
I don't want marks.
I live with my neck and my face all the time,
you know,

1313
01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:06.820
cause that's actually what I do.
It's cool.
But you know how like,
okay,

1314
01:17:06.821 --> 01:17:10.070
so I don't wear mouthpieces anymore.
So every once in a great while,
like I'll

1315
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.790
<v 1>bite my tongue and then you can't eat for a few days.
Not that good.
Yeah,
it's a,</v>

1316
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:19.380
or you ever get your job,
you can't eat,

1317
01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:24.330
just know it's hurts.
The next question is valid with Italian dressing.
Really.

1318
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:27.980
You're right,
you're right.
Eat for a club.
That's exaggerating,
but,

1319
01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:31.750
or if you get like a jaw,
like this is what I'll get,
my common one,

1320
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:36.650
you'll get your job whacked my knee or something.
Opposite dental.
Soccer.
Yeah.

1321
01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:40.880
So you can't bite down on that side.
So you kind of can't eat for like a week.

1322
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:46.100
You gotta chew you gotta you gotta drink through a straw anyway.
Um,

1323
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.340
but so yeah,
I get it.
But just like how you said,
man,

1324
01:17:49.341 --> 01:17:52.160
it's that ego and I'm in support of ego.

1325
01:17:52.161 --> 01:17:56.630
If for kind of what gives you Jujitsu and doing Jujitsu,
it's luster.
Really.

1326
01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.750
The guy like a guy going like,
what if I wrote with you and I tap you out,

1327
01:17:59.751 --> 01:18:02.420
but you were not going hard at all.
I don't want to do that.

1328
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:04.580
I'd rather get tapped out by you every single time.

1329
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:09.790
Then tap you out when you weren't going hard as far as like my Jujitsu journey

1330
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:14.480
kind of thing.
Yeah.
But,
but at the same time,
like,
Bro,

1331
01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:15.470
if you don't want that beef,

1332
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:19.400
if you don't want to go with some big guy going hard bread,

1333
01:18:19.401 --> 01:18:21.590
just say sorry bro.
I mean,
no districts,

1334
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.860
the main concern is not disrespecting the guy.
Like,
you know how you,

1335
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:29.120
I've asked people to roll and I know I'm maybe a little bit more bigger,

1336
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:33.980
whatever,
and then like the average guy,
so we'll ask someone to roll and they,

1337
01:18:33.981 --> 01:18:37.670
they won't even answer,
they'll just look away,
straight up,
look away.

1338
01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:40.910
And I'm like,
okay,
I really got to kind of understand,
okay,

1339
01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:44.150
maybe they just don't want that beef and they don't know how to say it to me

1340
01:18:44.151 --> 01:18:48.180
respectfully.
You know?
I've never had anyone like look away.
That's weird.
Yeah.

1341
01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:50.840
I had a time you asked them.
I okay.

1342
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:55.990
I asked a guy to roll and he acted like he didn't hear me and looked away.

1343
01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.370
I went to the next guy of standing up to maybe that kind of helped,

1344
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:05.810
didn't help my situation,
but whatever.
Um,
I asked the guy right next to him,

1345
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:07.880
same exact thing.
He acted like,

1346
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:11.360
oh he was kind of in a conversation and then I'll let me,

1347
01:19:11.361 --> 01:19:13.940
I've got little bit frustrated.
I said,
I said,
so no one wanted,

1348
01:19:13.941 --> 01:19:16.670
no one's rolling here.
That's what I said.
So that's what we're doing.

1349
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:19.070
Everyone's seen that unknown is wrong and then like someone rolls up to me to

1350
01:19:19.071 --> 01:19:22.110
think whatever his little while ago,
but the intimidated,

1351
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.020
but here's the thing is a thing.

1352
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.170
Of course at the time it's a little bit frustrating and this is kind of part of

1353
01:19:27.171 --> 01:19:32.171
the point where if they didn't want to roll cause maybe whatever else too big

1354
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:36.530
and they were like small or something like that,
then you can tell the guy,

1355
01:19:36.531 --> 01:19:40.760
hey respectfully like I don't want to roll with you.
I fear injury,

1356
01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:44.420
I fear whatever.
If your marks on my face or whatever,
no problem.

1357
01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.010
I dig it and I understand even if there's no one else,

1358
01:19:47.011 --> 01:19:49.880
the role where you're saying have the respect to tell you the truth.

1359
01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:53.570
That's the thing that needs the little pump of like they're scared of you.

1360
01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:58.860
He doesn't be the opposite though.
Nonetheless.
That's,

1361
01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:02.660
that's the thing though.
Like you,
that's what you have to,
in my opinion,

1362
01:20:02.661 --> 01:20:07.470
you have to address it
because I may have the,

1363
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.010
that

1364
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.740
<v 3>being said,
like if someone wants to roll with you,</v>

1365
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.180
if you're a healthy human being,
man,
getting on.
That's,
you know what I'm saying?

1366
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:19.950
That's what I was saying.
I get it.
If you have a situation,

1367
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:23.420
and this is one that I need to,
I always have to watch out for.
Like if I have,

1368
01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:28.020
let's say I'm injured and let's say I normally do 10 rounds,

1369
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.490
nine rounds,
eight rounds,

1370
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:34.230
like that's my normal training and when I'm injured I'll be like,

1371
01:20:34.231 --> 01:20:38.160
okay,
I'm only going to do like four rounds.
We're going to do five rounds.

1372
01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.060
But then someone's like,
let's get one more.
Yeah.

1373
01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:44.580
And that's the hardest thing for me is to say no because my instinct all the

1374
01:20:44.581 --> 01:20:47.160
time is like,
oh,
if someone wants to roll,
let's do it.
Let's do it.

1375
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:51.630
You just get it on.
You want to roll with me?
Let's get it on.
Yeah.
And so

1376
01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:55.660
yeah,
again,
this is all part of it too.

1377
01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.820
And this is a total opinion or philosophy or whatever.
But yeah,

1378
01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:03.150
that's how it should be.
That's what I think do,
that's how it should be.
You know,

1379
01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:06.900
like if I asked you to roll and you're just sitting there during the rolling

1380
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:08.160
part of,

1381
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.020
of training and you're just sitting there essentially waiting for someone to

1382
01:21:11.021 --> 01:21:13.570
asks you to roll.
Really?
That's what it is.
Right?
You know,

1383
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:17.010
and you'd like turn your head then why are you here?

1384
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:20.340
Like you're only going to roll with,
you asked me to roll and I was like,
hey man,

1385
01:21:20.341 --> 01:21:23.430
I got to tweak me.
I can't roll anymore today.
Metal,
you're going with that.
Fine.

1386
01:21:23.431 --> 01:21:26.390
Yeah,
100% you go home and then I got jacked.
That up isn't winning.

1387
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.760
It's chocolate.
I would do 100% but yes,
no,

1388
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:33.990
I'm talking about being selective with who you roll.

1389
01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.850
Like I won't roll with him because he'll tap me out.

1390
01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.980
I won't roll with him because he goes,
he goes hard and I'll get tired.

1391
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:44.460
Toughest people.
Yeah.
Okay.
And again,
that's like your philosophy.

1392
01:21:44.461 --> 01:21:47.790
And I agree with that.
But if you're like being selective,

1393
01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.080
like that guy is too big and advanced,
he might mess me up.
Look,
if you're,

1394
01:21:52.170 --> 01:21:55.770
if you're concerned about actual injury,
that's one thing.

1395
01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.620
But if you're like,
like the,

1396
01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.470
basically the situation that I explained those in and this is what,

1397
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.910
this is what I think given all the,

1398
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:06.030
all the information I kind of gathered from the situation.

1399
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:10.090
They didn't want to roll with me because I was maybe,
I dunno,

1400
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.840
big or intimidating where you higher belts than them.
Yes.

1401
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.980
That's really weird then.
No,
but see and that's what I thought too.
I was like,

1402
01:22:16.981 --> 01:22:21.690
well maybe there's honestly here bell,
if you're a lower belt and you're smaller,

1403
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:26.340
you have absolutely nothing.
No shame in getting tapped out by a big dude.

1404
01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:28.140
That's a higher belt.
The new,
that's what I was saying,

1405
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:29.860
cause I was talking to my brother and DJ.

1406
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:33.060
Did you do a breath check before you went in there or something?
Maybe a d check.

1407
01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:34.380
Maybe you just smelled really bad.

1408
01:22:34.381 --> 01:22:37.920
No one wanted to roll with you and Oprah because of the fact is I did do those

1409
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:40.470
checks.
I do them every single time.
That's why I know.

1410
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.280
But I talked to my brother and Greg about this.
I was like,

1411
01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.320
I was trying to be understanding,
you know,

1412
01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:50.530
but at the first part of the conversation,
uh,
no,

1413
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:53.040
I don't think Greg was there.
You might,
you might,

1414
01:22:53.041 --> 01:22:55.790
you might underestimate Greg train.
You might be like,
oh,

1415
01:22:55.791 --> 01:22:58.420
I'll just roll with this little guy.
You see his ears here.
Like

1416
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.110
I was talking to them like the next day or something.
So they weren't there.
But,

1417
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:07.760
um,
so Greg was saying the same thing as used like,
Nah,
Nah,

1418
01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.790
you don't do that stuff.
Why are you even here that you know,

1419
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.760
but Jay brought up a good point.
He said,
well,

1420
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:16.240
it doesn't matter why you think they should be there.
They're there.

1421
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:19.450
They pay their membership and they're there to learn Jujitsu.

1422
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:22.330
They have the right to train with whoever they want and they have the right to

1423
01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:25.650
not train with whoever.
They don't want to change with the freewill.

1424
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:29.200
It's true and that,
but that,
that very thing applies to this guy right here.

1425
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.980
Etiquette out the window.
Jay Charles,
right?
Yeah.

1426
01:23:32.981 --> 01:23:35.980
And that's kind of the counter argument,
which is legitimate by the way.

1427
01:23:35.981 --> 01:23:38.470
There is the etiquette of the mats.
It's like,

1428
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:41.440
it's like if you go to a 24 hour fitness gym or whatever,
you're the guy,

1429
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:45.550
you're not,
I mean now nowadays they have a sign says rewrite your weights.

1430
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:47.620
But you know,
there's certain things that you just,

1431
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:52.120
you just got to do for the etiquette.
You don't have to walk far.
Yeah,
of course.

1432
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:53.590
Came up again.
Akbar.
Yeah,

1433
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:58.591
he's a beast and he fights at one 55 so we'd walk around at one 70 strong and

1434
01:24:01.901 --> 01:24:06.550
not scared,
not scared,
but you know,
he and I would have wars,

1435
01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.700
wars,
total wars,
every single time mayhem.

1436
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:14.830
And we had a packed always is,
I will roll with you no matter what.

1437
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:17.910
No matter what is going on,
I will,
I will,
I will with it.

1438
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:21.580
And it was always like he'd come in for,
for me it was,
you know,

1439
01:24:21.581 --> 01:24:25.150
I'd roll in from either work or I'd be done training with a bunch of people and

1440
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:27.100
then he'd show up.
Or for him it was,

1441
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:30.790
he'd be done with like a crazy sparring session.
But yeah,
so I was,

1442
01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.640
I always told them no matter what,
I'll roll with you because,

1443
01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.500
and the reason I told them that is because I didn't want to roll with him.
Yeah.

1444
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.600
Because it was always freaking hardcore.
It was always,

1445
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:45.490
because he moved all the time and he was so strong and so fast and boney and

1446
01:24:45.491 --> 01:24:49.660
he's submissions are savage and he was a guy I'd like,

1447
01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:53.210
I didn't want to roll with them and that's exactly why I made a pact with my,

1448
01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:57.870
I would always roll with it.
Do it.
You want to be.
Yeah.
Cause it is a,

1449
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.830
it's a siege to roll with it.
And there's guys like that and you don't like,

1450
01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.440
you know,
it's funny,
you know Taylor and Andy by the way,

1451
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:08.110
there like that if you make it like that,
but if you don't,

1452
01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:11.260
well you might be different cause you're kind of in a different position.

1453
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.770
But when you wrote with them,
if you start to go light,

1454
01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:16.780
they'll just go light the whole time by the way.

1455
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:20.680
But if you turn up the heat then they'll turn up the heat.
But yeah,
that's,

1456
01:25:20.681 --> 01:25:24.220
that's a big thing where like some guys man and you're like,
okay,

1457
01:25:24.221 --> 01:25:26.290
I've got to get mentally ready to do this.
You know,

1458
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:31.210
because they just bring a lot and depends how your game matches up with them.

1459
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:34.540
Yeah.
You know,
you're gay matches differently with different people.
Yeah,

1460
01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:38.290
that's true too.
Big 10 but yeah,
this guy,
this guy,

1461
01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.490
you know,
does it normally leave you with lots of marks?
Not really.

1462
01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.440
I think you're right.
And,
but the more,
the more,
you know,
ambitious,
hungry,

1463
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.590
a white belts you row with the e.
Yeah.
The more and March.

1464
01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:55.210
And the more and more your ego forces you to fight them as if it's a death match

1465
01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.690
level nine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Very true.

1466
01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:03.680
And then do people who go full speed?
You know what,
50 50 maybe?

1467
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.790
<v 0>Well No,
technically no awful.</v>

1468
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.800
It's like can you cruise like I always do a warm up one warm up round with Andy.

1469
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:16.340
No one else with Andy and Dean Dean won't do a warm up around with me cause

1470
01:26:16.341 --> 01:26:19.190
that's when he really taxed at full strength deet.

1471
01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.430
Andy is awesome and we always do one round just to break a sweat.

1472
01:26:22.431 --> 01:26:25.730
We're just cruising and then the next one we'll go,
all right when we go,

1473
01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:26.893
I mean we go,

1474
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:32.470
I guess maybe there's some gradation at the high end of the spectrum and I will

1475
01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:34.580
recognize a difference between that.

1476
01:26:34.581 --> 01:26:38.270
Like let's say for instance you say like,

1477
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:41.750
I'll know I don't want to let any pass my guard today.
Right.

1478
01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.970
It was like for referred like a legit reason.

1479
01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:47.000
Like I think he's got some new office and move that I've seen been pulling off

1480
01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:48.800
and I go,
what if he gets his position on me today?

1481
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.220
I'm going to be in a real bad situation so he's not passing my card.

1482
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:54.580
So then he'll feel like I'm going harder.
Yeah,

1483
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:58.190
because a lot of times you were younger,
you pass my guard.
Okay,
cool.
Whatever.

1484
01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:00.430
And now you're across side.
Now they're trying to escape that.
What are,

1485
01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.350
you know what I mean?
It's,
it's,
that's like when you're competing,
we are,

1486
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:05.690
when you're,
when someone is competing with you in Jujitsu,

1487
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:06.880
especially with the gay,

1488
01:27:06.881 --> 01:27:11.881
it's so noticeable in a competition how hard they grip everything and how you

1489
01:27:11.931 --> 01:27:16.010
can't get a millimeter of movement that you don't have to fight for.

1490
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.500
You can't simulate that in,

1491
01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.630
you can't simulate that level of intensity on the mats that only comes to

1492
01:27:23.631 --> 01:27:27.740
competition.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The,
in the chart on the training maths.
But in a way,

1493
01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:30.670
and I talked to Greg about this a lot where it's kind of,

1494
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:32.900
you know how like someone's being super stubborn,

1495
01:27:32.901 --> 01:27:36.110
like what the day I was talking to him,
this is what I was talking about.

1496
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:39.200
Like the guy who you get a sweep autumn or something and they don't,

1497
01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:41.630
it's almost like they're not even fighting Jujitsu anymore.

1498
01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.210
They just want to get to their feet and stand up cause they don't want to play

1499
01:27:44.211 --> 01:27:45.770
on the bottom right.
These guys.

1500
01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.010
So I'll talk to them that him about that and you know that it was kind of

1501
01:27:49.011 --> 01:27:51.650
frustrating and whatever and he was like,
hey bro,

1502
01:27:51.651 --> 01:27:55.850
like that's like that's kind of his job was to like give you an accurate

1503
01:27:55.851 --> 01:28:00.740
representation of somebody giving you trouble in whatever way I was about to

1504
01:28:00.741 --> 01:28:03.050
tell it.
That's the same thing that Jade Charles says.
Like if that guy,

1505
01:28:03.051 --> 01:28:05.990
if you allow that guy to get to your feet,
then that's bad.
As a matter of fact,

1506
01:28:05.991 --> 01:28:10.490
I went through this cycle with Dean where I realized that I wasn't giving dean a

1507
01:28:10.491 --> 01:28:14.840
good representation because every time he had some good guard passes that he

1508
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:19.370
would do from a little bit of a distance and,
and they were working well.

1509
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:21.570
And then I said,
well,
why don't I just stand up?
Yeah.

1510
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:24.500
And so then I just started standing up and then all of a sudden he realized he

1511
01:28:24.501 --> 01:28:26.930
couldn't give me that much space,
which messed up that guard pass,

1512
01:28:26.931 --> 01:28:30.500
which put us back to both getting better because we are improving the,

1513
01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:35.570
the techniques that we were each using.
So yeah,
sometimes.
Now,

1514
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:40.250
have you ever rolled with someone that you,
um,
they're just not doing,

1515
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:44.030
they're there.
They are.
They're just,
they're just not engaging.

1516
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.710
They're not engaged.
And that can be,
that can be a little bit frustrating.
Yes.

1517
01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:52.220
And sometimes I do that.
Yeah.

1518
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:55.560
But that's part of an overall strategy as part of the launch strategy.
But yeah.

1519
01:28:55.610 --> 01:29:00.050
Oh yeah,
100%.
Like the guy,
the guy who is not because,
and again,

1520
01:29:00.051 --> 01:29:02.160
this goes back to why you're doing Jujitsu to begin

1521
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.790
<v 3>with though.
So let's say if you,
if you're doing it,</v>

1522
01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:07.650
like to compete in a tournament,
a guy not engaging,

1523
01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.190
that's part of your training right there too.
If you're like,
you know,

1524
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:12.480
if this is the fight in,
you know,

1525
01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:17.481
if you like all elements and let's say you're focusing on like a self defense

1526
01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:21.550
situation and the guy's not engaging,
then yeah,
you might as well be like I am.

1527
01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:23.820
I might as well train with those.
Good.
You're right.
It is good.

1528
01:29:23.821 --> 01:29:27.700
Because also I've gone with like some wrestlers that they know,
they're,

1529
01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:30.690
let's say there are purple belt in Jujitsu and they're doing a five minute round

1530
01:29:30.691 --> 01:29:32.250
with you and they're just there.

1531
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:35.670
They're goal is to just avoid and knock it tapped out.

1532
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.560
And they're not really gonna Roll Jiu Jitsu with you.

1533
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.420
They're just going to avoid and knock a tapped out.

1534
01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:41.450
You're not going to progress like,
oh,

1535
01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.810
they get the double leg now they're in your guard.

1536
01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:45.360
They're gonna sit there and hold your hips.
Yeah.
So they're gonna sit there.

1537
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.570
So for me,
what I have to do,
I need to have some moves.
It gets them out of the,

1538
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:52.680
that's you got to take some ownership for though.
Yeah.

1539
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:56.220
Just like the guy who doesn't like task,
who strong,
it doesn't tap,
you know?

1540
01:29:56.370 --> 01:30:00.990
So either forces you to like in Jerome or let go kind of thing.

1541
01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:04.320
That's kind of the same thing where it's,
it's,

1542
01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.380
it's a weird dichotomy though because like,
what do you do now?

1543
01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:09.180
Now it's Kinda up to you.
You know the guy who,
okay,

1544
01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:12.860
so if a guy doesn't tap right and you kind of get mad,
I'm look good,

1545
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.510
you're going to force me to injure you.
You know,

1546
01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.760
you have to take that training as,

1547
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:22.320
as this realistic training where this guy is giving you a very accurate look,

1548
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:27.600
where sure you can choose to enjoy them.
Now it's on you.
You chose to intro.

1549
01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:29.970
Sure.
And whatever you chose,
you chose,

1550
01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:33.510
especially if he was giving you less of an option or you just let them go and

1551
01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:34.321
understand that.
Yeah,

1552
01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:38.070
I understand accurately gotta be honest with yourself that I would've had that

1553
01:30:38.071 --> 01:30:39.380
submission.
I could have been dumb,

1554
01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:44.690
but don't be all mad because you shop dept and give me that Wayne in training,

1555
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.610
you know,
like,
don't do that,
you know?
Yeah.

1556
01:30:47.611 --> 01:30:50.640
You gotta you gotta keep your mind wait,
but you said who cares?
Come on Bro.

1557
01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:53.970
Come on.
All right,
so your,
you were talking but I know,
but you care though.

1558
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:59.350
I care.
What if someone,
if someone,
cause one time I,

1559
01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:03.420
the reason I was talking to,
well I was talking to Greg again about it,
about,

1560
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.930
I'm a guy was walking with who didn't want to tap and I was mad because he was

1561
01:31:06.931 --> 01:31:11.370
forcing me to either in his room or he wasn't going to give me that,

1562
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.890
that win in training.
So what'd you do?

1563
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:19.410
I let them go from one time and it was a white belt.
He started going hard.

1564
01:31:19.411 --> 01:31:22.770
You know how this is just an old wine belt.
What submission was it?

1565
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:26.470
I'm talking about another story now.
I told them,
I'm just saying like Maura,

1566
01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:29.270
the both.
Okay.
So the,
the regional story.

1567
01:31:29.271 --> 01:31:32.970
I was talking that's all comedian not tap into a community.
Yeah,
he was strong.

1568
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:38.280
But um,
so maybe you didn't really have it like I had it.

1569
01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:42.330
It's,
I'm not weak either.
That's the thing.
So He's strong and I'm like,
okay.

1570
01:31:42.331 --> 01:31:46.680
It's to hear your steer.
It's here.
It didn't matter.
I knew,

1571
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.990
I knew with certainty where it's like,
okay,

1572
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:53.670
I'm going to have to injure the person now.
Um,
and you know,
he didn't have,

1573
01:31:53.671 --> 01:31:56.580
but Greg made a good point where it's like,
that's his job.
You know,

1574
01:31:56.581 --> 01:32:00.520
he's giving you an accurate look of what it's like.
So at the end of the day,

1575
01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:03.820
sure I could have chose to insure them and then it's partially his fault.

1576
01:32:03.821 --> 01:32:06.550
But the thing is I can't account for whether it's his fault or not.

1577
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:10.180
I'm accounting for what training I'm getting,
by the way.
What training?

1578
01:32:10.181 --> 01:32:12.910
I'm getting not come,
you know,
it's not a competition.
It's not in the street.

1579
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:16.390
Switching stories.
I'll make it quick too.

1580
01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:17.800
It was a white belt that was rolling with,

1581
01:32:17.801 --> 01:32:22.420
he was going nuts and I took it personal back to what we were talking about you

1582
01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:25.880
at this time,
purple.
So I was taking it personal.
It's like,
well,

1583
01:32:25.881 --> 01:32:29.380
what do or you try to go nuts on me.
Like just doing stuff.

1584
01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.120
It was all within the confines of etiquette,

1585
01:32:31.121 --> 01:32:32.740
but he was going a little bit too hard.
Right.

1586
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:36.010
Later I find out that's just his style by the way,

1587
01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:39.520
which is a total innocent thing.
But at that time I was like,
no.
I was like,
okay,

1588
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:43.060
you want to go hard,
I'm going to go hard.
And I injured them.
Here's the thing,

1589
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:47.260
I injured him with a submission cause I went d Kimora again.

1590
01:32:47.730 --> 01:32:51.610
And not that I did it necessarily so hard that I heard him,

1591
01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:56.020
but he had a bad shoulder and I didn't really know.
He said no,
no,
it's okay.

1592
01:32:56.021 --> 01:32:59.560
I had a bad shoulder.
I was gonna say,

1593
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:03.550
I've never injured anyone with a submission,
but I have injured a couple people.

1594
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:09.280
One of them Diandra you.
Yeah,
my red man.
I injured myself.
Yeah,

1595
01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.360
no,
but I'm saying with a submission locked in,
right?
Yeah.

1596
01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:17.140
The Times I've done it is I can only think of one off the top of my head.

1597
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:18.220
And it was a guy,
like you said,

1598
01:33:18.221 --> 01:33:21.850
just had preexisting shoulder injury that was like,
that was like,
ah,

1599
01:33:21.851 --> 01:33:26.200
tap and then I'm hurt and then my shoulders bad.
Right Bro,

1600
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.640
you're rolling with me.
Tell me.
It was a black belt,
you know,
it was like,
Bro,

1601
01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:34.750
come on.
I'm not a guy.
I'd seen her in awhile.
I just go,
you know,
big,
strong guy.

1602
01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.070
God got the career and I'd put it on and all of a sudden he's like,
ah,

1603
01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:42.100
and injured and,
and I just said,
Bro,
I didn't,
it wasn't,

1604
01:33:42.101 --> 01:33:47.101
I mean I know the complete limitations of where it's injury or not and I was not

1605
01:33:47.231 --> 01:33:50.800
there yet at all.
Yeah.
And so he's like,
Yo,
I got a bad shoulder.

1606
01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:52.260
I should have told you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1607
01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:56.110
And that's actually why I felt really guilty because I did.
I was like,
Oh,

1608
01:33:56.111 --> 01:33:58.510
you want to go hard?
Until I did it hard,
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

1609
01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.020
But if you had a bad shoulder,
which he did,

1610
01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:05.140
I understand it hurt him and I,

1611
01:34:05.141 --> 01:34:07.090
that doesn't surprise me that it hurt them and I shouldn't,

1612
01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:09.670
I shouldn't have went that heart to begin with as far as like going,

1613
01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.700
I know how to do.
He Kimora good.
Yeah.

1614
01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:14.230
And just kind of to clarify my earlier statements,

1615
01:34:14.231 --> 01:34:19.220
like when somebody goes level nine on me,
it doesn't mean I'm like Alto.
No,

1616
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:23.830
I just go,
I just apply level.
If they're a little mind,

1617
01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:28.810
I'm gonna apply a level 9.1 back to them and put them and actually usually I do

1618
01:34:28.811 --> 01:34:31.810
something to him that forces them to calm down.
Like I'll just,

1619
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:35.590
I'll get across side and be like,
hm.
Keeps spousing keep going.
Nuts.

1620
01:34:35.591 --> 01:34:38.470
Right now I'm just going to be here.
We're cruising

1621
01:34:40.290 --> 01:34:42.760
at level 9.1 but just the level of nine for one book,

1622
01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:45.640
completely cruising because they can't move.

1623
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:49.030
They're there talking and going crazy and getting nuts and then you're just

1624
01:34:49.031 --> 01:34:52.520
sitting there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But yeah,

1625
01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:57.500
I still feel guilty about that day.
I'll never do it again.
Next question.

1626
01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:00.893
<v 0>Hi Jocko.</v>

1627
01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:05.570
I have read your book extreme ownership from cover to cover it and I learned a

1628
01:35:05.571 --> 01:35:09.590
lot from it and I have a question that bothers me.

1629
01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:17.170
The question is how can I be noticed by the people and get chosen for a leader?

1630
01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.650
Okay,
good.
Kind of uh,
another question that I hear,
you know,

1631
01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:28.600
people get worried that if they're just kind of putting their head down and

1632
01:35:28.601 --> 01:35:30.460
working,
then they were not going to get noticed.

1633
01:35:30.461 --> 01:35:31.810
How do I get noticed how I become a leader?

1634
01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:35.380
Stop worrying about being noticed that that's number one,

1635
01:35:35.381 --> 01:35:37.780
stop worrying about being noticed and keep working hard.

1636
01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:42.640
Stop warning about being chosen as a leader.

1637
01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:48.310
If your goal is to get chosen as a leader,
no work hard.

1638
01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:52.600
I actually work really hard and then put the team first.

1639
01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:56.530
So all these thoughts and efforts that you have around getting noticed and being

1640
01:35:56.531 --> 01:36:00.420
recognized instead of having them focused on being recognized and being noticed,

1641
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:05.430
put those thoughts on making the team successful.
Wow.

1642
01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:08.830
Wow.
Put the team first.

1643
01:36:08.831 --> 01:36:12.280
That's what I'm saying right now with this question,

1644
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:16.570
you're actually putting yourself your self recognition above the team.

1645
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:20.830
So instead of thinking about that,
think about how you can help the team win.

1646
01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:23.890
And the more of a team player you are,

1647
01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:27.700
the more people will want to work with you.

1648
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.480
The more you help the team win,
the more people say,

1649
01:36:31.481 --> 01:36:36.370
I want you on my team.
And eventually they say,
okay,
you know what?

1650
01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:39.190
I want you to lead this team because you want this team to win so bad.

1651
01:36:39.191 --> 01:36:43.270
We want you to lead this team.
So that is what you do.

1652
01:36:43.271 --> 01:36:47.170
Now that being said,
right,
there's always,

1653
01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:51.820
there's always a balance because I'm not saying that you sit back and just keep

1654
01:36:51.821 --> 01:36:54.460
your fingers crossed that if you work hard,
someone's going to notice you.

1655
01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:57.610
Now with this guy who's all worried about being noticed,

1656
01:36:57.611 --> 01:36:58.690
don't worry about being noticed.

1657
01:36:58.691 --> 01:37:00.730
You're going to get noticed if you work out and put your head down.

1658
01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.040
But there's some people that they're there,

1659
01:37:03.041 --> 01:37:08.041
so they might be so humble that they're not going to get noticed for what

1660
01:37:08.861 --> 01:37:11.770
they're doing.
So how do you overcome that?
Well,

1661
01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:14.190
this doesn't mean that you sit back in your past.

1662
01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:18.130
If there's an oh and I'll tell you the best way to stand out or one of the best

1663
01:37:18.131 --> 01:37:20.260
ways to stand out is volunteer,

1664
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:24.040
volunteer for everything that comes up and then crush it.

1665
01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:28.210
The crappy jobs that no one wants.
Volunteer for those things.

1666
01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:31.020
That's what I used to see.
You should see the,

1667
01:37:31.021 --> 01:37:32.980
the young new guys in the seal teams,

1668
01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:38.230
that's how you tell you get some crappy job.
You walk out to a,

1669
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:43.220
a group of guys going through training through it.
A bunch of platoon guys,

1670
01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:44.770
you're,
hey,
I need three guys.

1671
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:49.450
There'd be like two new guys that would just be like by their hands would be up

1672
01:37:49.451 --> 01:37:52.960
before you could get done saying the sentence and you just see the look on their

1673
01:37:52.961 --> 01:37:55.980
face.
What do they want to do?
They just want to win.
I use,
I love those guys.

1674
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:59.700
They're just like,
oh,
I'll do that.
Hey,
hey,
I need a couple of guys through.
Boom.

1675
01:37:59.701 --> 01:38:02.040
They're hands are up.
You don't even know,
you know,
gun to say,

1676
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:05.100
go clean the sewer out.
They don't care.
They don't care.

1677
01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.470
They're volunteering for everything and you know what?

1678
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:11.520
I got when I got to the team.
That's what I did.
Volunteered for every,

1679
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.211
as a matter of fact,

1680
01:38:12.211 --> 01:38:16.560
I volunteered to be a radio man because I'd heard that it was a really hard job

1681
01:38:16.561 --> 01:38:19.320
that no one wanted it.
It was like,
oh,
okay,
I'll do that job.

1682
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:22.020
You got a job that's really hard.
No one wants to carry a heavy weight.

1683
01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:24.360
You don't get to shoot it.
Right.

1684
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:27.050
You get to carry them 60 there a major benefit to that.

1685
01:38:27.051 --> 01:38:31.680
That is you get to unload massive amounts of firepower.
You carry your radio,

1686
01:38:31.681 --> 01:38:33.600
you're just sitting around with batteries.

1687
01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:37.680
It's kind of hardcore in a different way.
It is.
It is.
And I,
luckily I got,

1688
01:38:37.710 --> 01:38:40.770
I got told two things,
number one,
that no one wanted that job.
And number two,

1689
01:38:40.771 --> 01:38:44.220
that if you were radium and you'd go on every mission because they always need a

1690
01:38:44.221 --> 01:38:47.010
radio man,
and that's all help me a lot.
To me,
I want to go on every mission,

1691
01:38:47.490 --> 01:38:52.080
so I'll take,
I'll carry that radio,
but that,
that and everything,
you know,

1692
01:38:52.081 --> 01:38:54.330
you use a volunteer for everything.
So that's,

1693
01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:59.760
that's one of the best ways that you can make a good impression is by

1694
01:38:59.761 --> 01:39:02.370
volunteering for stuff and then crushing it.

1695
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:04.800
And eventually people look at you and they say,
Oh,

1696
01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:07.350
this guy doesn't care what we give them.
He's going to crush this task.

1697
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.310
And you know what?

1698
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:11.700
People like working with him because he's worried about the team and this person

1699
01:39:11.701 --> 01:39:14.520
seems like a,
let's get him,
let's give him a little task then and lead something.

1700
01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:16.860
Because sometimes when you volunteer for something,

1701
01:39:16.861 --> 01:39:19.140
you're volunteering for leadership position.
Hey,
I need four guys,

1702
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:21.620
one of those people,
it's going to be in charge.
Right.
For,

1703
01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.050
it's not gonna be four guys going equally into some thing,
right?
No.

1704
01:39:25.051 --> 01:39:28.170
Someone's going to be within charge.
Yeah.
Someone's going to take charge of it.

1705
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:28.980
Be that person.
Yeah.

1706
01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:32.400
<v 1>Huh.
Yeah.
That's good.
This,
um,</v>

1707
01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:38.550
when he said,
how can I be noticed?
So work hard.
Yeah.
But you know how it's like,

1708
01:39:38.551 --> 01:39:41.250
okay,
that's,
that's what I want.
I want to be noticed.
Right.

1709
01:39:41.670 --> 01:39:46.670
So you ever walk into a bar or something and a girl walks in and she,

1710
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:51.240
you can tell she's trying to be noticed if the bad luck,
man,

1711
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:55.860
so what I'm saying is you like if you're trying to be noticed so people can see

1712
01:39:55.861 --> 01:39:59.370
that stuff like is kind of just trying to be noticed right here and it does the

1713
01:39:59.371 --> 01:40:02.160
opposite obviously.
That's,
yeah,
you're right.

1714
01:40:02.161 --> 01:40:05.460
That's the hardest thing to convince the people,

1715
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.070
convince people love is the fact that if you're just,

1716
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:12.290
if you're just working hard,
you'll get noticed.
You will get noticed.

1717
01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:17.670
It's like you do something kind of good or whatever.
Brave.
I don't know.
Hey,
look,

1718
01:40:17.671 --> 01:40:20.940
did you guys all see how brave I was right there?
Yeah.
Brad,

1719
01:40:20.941 --> 01:40:25.770
no one wants you to be a leader.
All right there.
It's like saying,
Hey,
I'm like,

1720
01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.900
hey guys,
that task I did pretty good,
right?

1721
01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:33.780
I was really humble.
No one's,
no one's more humble than me.
No one's La homeless.

1722
01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:38.060
<v 0>Stop worrying about you and think of helping the team and volunteer a bunch of</v>

1723
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:41.200
nuts.
That's where you'll end up in a leadership position.

1724
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:47.930
<v 1>Got time for one more.
Yeah,
might as well.
Last question.</v>

1725
01:40:47.931 --> 01:40:50.780
Question for Uncle Jake from James,
who's nine,

1726
01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:54.520
can you be but strong

1727
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:55.360
<v 0>at the same time?</v>

1728
01:40:57.170 --> 01:41:01.880
Can you be weak but strong at the same time?
Yes you can.

1729
01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:07.640
You can't because you can be,
for instance,
you can be physically strong,

1730
01:41:09.010 --> 01:41:13.360
but at the same time you could be mentally weak or you could be the opposite.

1731
01:41:13.361 --> 01:41:15.310
You could be mentally weak,

1732
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:19.210
but at the same time physically strong.

1733
01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:24.250
And I would love to be able to put a priority on one of those.

1734
01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:30.360
And I know I've said before that knowledge is the most important thing,

1735
01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:38.130
but the reality is if you don't have the strength or actually the health

1736
01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.550
to back that up,
or even to function as a human being physically,

1737
01:41:45.670 --> 01:41:49.810
then your knowledge and your mental strength doesn't really even matter.

1738
01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:54.680
So that comes into play.

1739
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:59.420
And being big and strong is also totally useless.

1740
01:42:00.110 --> 01:42:03.320
If you're mentally weak and you quit.

1741
01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:11.660
Now being mentally strong should actually lead you to being physically strong.

1742
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:13.770
Because if you are mentally strong,

1743
01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:19.200
then you can work and train to become physically strong.

1744
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.510
But if you're
mentally weak,

1745
01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:31.290
then you will not hold the line on the good foods and the good workouts and you

1746
01:42:32.171 --> 01:42:36.490
won't get physically strong or healthy.

1747
01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:41.093
So

1748
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:46.680
can you be weak and strong at the same time?
Yes,

1749
01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:50.160
but I say be strong.

1750
01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:56.700
Train your physical strength and exercise your mental strength by doing the

1751
01:42:57.461 --> 01:42:59.860
right things via hard things.

1752
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1753
01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:05.370
<v 0>The things you know you're supposed to do,</v>

1754
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:08.203
do them

1755
01:43:10.210 --> 01:43:14.890
and be as strong as you can mentally,
physically,

1756
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:19.480
and emotionally for yourself,
for your team,

1757
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:24.540
for your family.
Hold the line

1758
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:31.170
and be strong.
Okay.

1759
01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:36.030
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1760
01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.850
So Echo Charles,

1761
01:43:39.210 --> 01:43:42.570
speaking of holding the line,

1762
01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.990
perhaps you could hold your portion of the line here and explained to people how

1763
01:43:48.991 --> 01:43:52.070
they can support this podcast in the event

1764
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.220
<v 1>that they would like to do so sure.
Be Happy to.</v>

1765
01:43:56.030 --> 01:44:00.920
Thanks for allowing me the opportunity.
We'll talk about origin,
right?

1766
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:05.420
American made course from the beginning to end.
American made.

1767
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.460
It's a big deal actually.
Also supplements,
right?
Jocko supplements.

1768
01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.300
Wait,
American made what?
What was that first part?
Everything.

1769
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:15.980
I'm just saying that's like a disclaimer.

1770
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:19.490
Like everything we're about to talk about from origin is American made straight

1771
01:44:19.491 --> 01:44:21.170
up.
So people,

1772
01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:25.160
you've been being asked about supplements for a while.
Yeah,

1773
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:29.150
probably from the beginning I think.
All right,
well here you go.

1774
01:44:29.151 --> 01:44:33.710
Here's some Jocko supplements for your joints.
Krill oil,
Super Krill oil.

1775
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:38.540
So not just cries,
Super Krill oil,
Jocko,
Super Krill oil.
Boom.

1776
01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:42.440
Also Jocko joint warfare.
That's like a blend.

1777
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:47.890
Glucosomine couldn't joy is it [inaudible] can Jordan can in which comes from,

1778
01:44:48.891 --> 01:44:53.120
you know where it comes from?
Sea Cucumbers.
Didn't know that.
Did you,

1779
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:58.160
ah,
I'd actually,
I think you'd mentioned it,
but I don't,
you know,

1780
01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:01.670
hey,
we know now and really that's what's important.
Um,

1781
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:05.540
very good stuff because I would say it is the main thing,

1782
01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:09.980
like joint supplements,
like Krill oil,
you know,
the,
these are,

1783
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:14.300
these supplements helped me way more than any protein powder.
And back in the,

1784
01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:18.050
I used to take protein powder and you know,

1785
01:45:18.051 --> 01:45:22.610
these weight gainer things and I don't even think that they helped really.

1786
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:27.050
I'm not saying they don't help,
but I just,
you just don't.
These,
the joint stuff,

1787
01:45:27.051 --> 01:45:29.630
Krill oil,
especially joint warfare.

1788
01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:34.850
These things help you way more and for a longer too,
by the way.
Nonetheless,

1789
01:45:34.851 --> 01:45:38.750
there's also some geese on there and rash guards still all made in America

1790
01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.990
from the beginning to the end.
It's one thing to import material from,
you know,

1791
01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:49.520
other places,
you know,
and that's cool too.
I get it and I dig it,

1792
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:52.040
but in the event of you wanting it,
uh,

1793
01:45:52.041 --> 01:45:56.570
you know all this stuff they'd be made made in America.
Boom.
Origin main.com.

1794
01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:59.480
Go on there,
see what you like,
get something if you want.

1795
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:03.260
Also fitness gear.
So I was,
you know,

1796
01:46:03.261 --> 01:46:06.530
I'm into kettle bells now I'm into other lifting too of course.

1797
01:46:06.531 --> 01:46:11.180
But kettlebells are a bigger part of my routine and just slowly I kind of get

1798
01:46:11.181 --> 01:46:13.550
more like,
oh you get stronger,
you get the bigger one.

1799
01:46:13.551 --> 01:46:16.670
I took a step back the other day when I was lifting,

1800
01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:21.380
stood back and looked at my setup.
It's pretty dope.

1801
01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.330
I don't have like the normal kettle bells.
It's like I have this one.

1802
01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:30.080
The point is k so on it,
that's where I get the kettle bells from on it.

1803
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:34.280
You got some other cool stuff on there,
but minor,
all the primal bells.

1804
01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.850
One few legend bells.

1805
01:46:37.851 --> 01:46:42.500
They're like the artistic ones obviously kind of when you sit back and you look,

1806
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:46.040
look at your set up,
I think that's a big deal when you're set up is dope.

1807
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:49.800
I'm just saying.
Yeah,
you want your set up to be dealt,
going to audit,

1808
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:50.641
get their kettle bells.

1809
01:46:50.641 --> 01:46:53.730
You can get the regular ones to see that and they're kind of understated and I

1810
01:46:53.731 --> 01:46:56.160
dig it.
But um,
and I'm sticking with the Werewolf.

1811
01:46:57.210 --> 01:47:01.470
I got that big foot one 90 pounds.
I've been doing some work with dawn.

1812
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:07.220
How big is yours?
My biggest is 40 kilograms.
That's only 88 cents.

1813
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:10.800
There might be getting two pounds stronger than me.
Yeah,
every single rep.

1814
01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:16.260
So that's,
that's something cool.
It's not nothing.
It's something.

1815
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:20.880
Anyway,
[inaudible] dot com slash Jocko that's a good one.
Same thing.
Go on there.

1816
01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:25.020
You like something,
get something good way to support.

1817
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:29.970
Also when you buy these books,
the Jocko reviews from time to time,

1818
01:47:29.971 --> 01:47:31.140
no book today.
I understand,

1819
01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:35.100
but you want to buy any of those books on our website,
Jocko,

1820
01:47:35.101 --> 01:47:39.210
podcast.com section called books from episodes,

1821
01:47:39.211 --> 01:47:42.180
all the books by episode.
Boom.
Click through there and when you get them

1822
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.010
and if you happen to do any other shopping,
boom,
click through their same thing,

1823
01:47:47.011 --> 01:47:50.760
same deal,
you know,
goes and takes you to Amazon and you know,
boom.

1824
01:47:50.761 --> 01:47:53.010
That's a good way to support small action.
Big Retail.
You know,

1825
01:47:53.011 --> 01:47:56.730
just the one little click go in their shop.
Boom.
Good way to support.

1826
01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.680
Excellent way to support.

1827
01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:04.410
Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.
Seems obvious.
I know,

1828
01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.300
but you know,
sometimes you want to listen to one or two or whatever.

1829
01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:12.720
Be like,
is it worth it to subscribe I think,
I think,
yeah.
Subscribed.

1830
01:48:13.450 --> 01:48:18.160
You think so?
Yeah.
I subscribed to this podcast to me too and I,

1831
01:48:18.250 --> 01:48:20.610
I have the actual,
yeah,
might as well.

1832
01:48:20.630 --> 01:48:23.280
It's good and that's a good way to support leave a review if you're in the mood

1833
01:48:23.281 --> 01:48:26.220
to cause,
I mean it makes sense.

1834
01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:29.550
You know where you figure,
you know,
people on Twitter,

1835
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.590
they'll say like if something's up like hey you,
you know you,
there was like,

1836
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.340
like a definition.
Remember the,
there was the one book I,
it's,

1837
01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:40.290
I'm drawing a blank on which book,

1838
01:48:40.291 --> 01:48:44.700
but it was a British one was a mistake.
No,
there wasn't a mistake.

1839
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:47.940
There was the word knob number.
You called them and I was like,

1840
01:48:47.941 --> 01:48:52.340
what does the Knob,
and then people on Twitter were like,
boom,
send it to me.
Boom,

1841
01:48:52.341 --> 01:48:56.400
boom,
boom.
So it makes sense,
you know,
feedback man.
Pete,
we're all involved,

1842
01:48:56.610 --> 01:48:58.740
you know.
So yeah,
if you want to leave a review,
leave a review.

1843
01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:00.720
If you're in the mood,
don't have to of course.

1844
01:49:00.721 --> 01:49:04.680
But if you're in the mood to also youtube,
subscribe to the Allen.

1845
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:08.880
We have a youtube channel,
Jocko podcasts.
Pretty good one.

1846
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.860
On top of the video version of this podcast,

1847
01:49:13.861 --> 01:49:18.510
we include little excerpts from the podcast.
Just little nuggets of,
you know how,

1848
01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:21.300
especially with the Q and a,
it's,
it's good because it's like,
okay,

1849
01:49:21.301 --> 01:49:22.830
I don't want listen to the whole Q and a.

1850
01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:27.180
Even though I do mark them by timestamp in subject,
but nonetheless,

1851
01:49:28.890 --> 01:49:31.830
you know their little note where you can kind of share it with,
oh shoot,

1852
01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:36.831
I remember my friend who needed some advice on you did two rolling or how to do

1853
01:49:39.061 --> 01:49:41.460
good in college or whatever,
you know,
so you can just share it with them.

1854
01:49:41.461 --> 01:49:43.050
They don't have to listen to the whole podcast anyway.

1855
01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.730
They're little excerpts we put on there.

1856
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:47.770
Some other stuff do deleted scenes from time to time.

1857
01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:51.130
<v 3>Wait,
add another one of those.
Anyway,</v>

1858
01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:55.390
point is subscribe to our youtube channel if you want to.

1859
01:49:56.650 --> 01:50:00.550
Also Jack was a store.
It's called Jocko store.
Jacqueline,

1860
01:50:00.570 --> 01:50:03.670
store.com on there.
There are t shirts,
travel mugs,

1861
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:07.740
some bumper stickers.
We might be out of bumper stickers.
No,
no,
no.

1862
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:09.850
We are both bumper stickers,
some women's stuff on there.

1863
01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:13.100
Some shirts of course with La.

1864
01:50:13.101 --> 01:50:16.300
I feel like we haven't talked about the layers on the shirts recently.

1865
01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:18.880
That's really disappointing to everyone.

1866
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Or maybe are you talk about the layers on or maybe that in and of itself is a

1867
01:50:24.131 --> 01:50:28.690
layer,
right?
You just don't talk about the layers.
You just let them exist.

1868
01:50:29.230 --> 01:50:32.720
Layers.
That's a layer in its own right.
That's what I mean there.
Yeah,

1869
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:37.390
exactly right.
So it is pretty lame if you have described the layers.
Yeah.

1870
01:50:37.391 --> 01:50:42.180
It's like describing like the punchline of a joke kind of.
It's not a Joni.
Yeah.

1871
01:50:42.181 --> 01:50:45.970
Yeah.
It's just the lack jail.
Either way.
Just some shirts on there.

1872
01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:51.010
Also rash guards,
I think we're doing a warrior kid rash guard.
Oh Nice.

1873
01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:52.330
We're doing it with Pete.
Oh,

1874
01:50:52.331 --> 01:50:56.920
nice American made or your kid rash guards.

1875
01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:57.873
Nice.

1876
01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:03.450
One side says when other sites has learned in the back says this is about

1877
01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:06.610
everything day going to be good credit.

1878
01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:12.490
How far out of the of those from being released.
Oh,
we're narrowing down the cut.

1879
01:51:12.670 --> 01:51:17.230
You know,
because I'm tough talking to Pete.
He's like,
kids are shaped different.

1880
01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:19.190
There's just shaped kind of weird.
So you got to,

1881
01:51:19.330 --> 01:51:21.820
there's some refining that kind of has to go into the shape.
But yeah,

1882
01:51:21.850 --> 01:51:26.080
that's more or less it also some,
I said women's stuff,
but yeah,

1883
01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:30.190
some hoodies,
hoodies should be,
should be available.

1884
01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:35.260
Nice.
Not right this moment.
Anytime of this moment.
They're common.

1885
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:39.320
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thick winter hoodies either way.
And if you go on there,
and if this,

1886
01:51:39.330 --> 01:51:42.010
if something's out,
which risk,
especially now like I'm trying,

1887
01:51:42.011 --> 01:51:45.760
I'm really narrowing down my whole process there.

1888
01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:47.350
But if something's out of stock or whatever,

1889
01:51:47.351 --> 01:51:49.870
there's a little thing on there and you just put your email in there.
I don't,

1890
01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:54.610
it's not a spam thing at all.
In fact,
a lot of people who sign up for email list,

1891
01:51:54.611 --> 01:51:57.970
which is another thing,
like I don't really send much the point,

1892
01:51:57.971 --> 01:51:59.410
and not that that's a good thing,
but I'm saying no.

1893
01:51:59.411 --> 01:52:01.690
Sometimes I get contacted by these people

1894
01:52:03.730 --> 01:52:07.780
with their advice,
advice about stuff.
And I'm not,
not trying to say,
I'm like,

1895
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:12.850
I'm not being arrogant.
Right.
But they're the people that talk to me about like,

1896
01:52:12.851 --> 01:52:17.640
um,
oh,
what is it?
Building the,
Oh,
the,
Oh,
okay.

1897
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:21.680
About the podcasts.
Like the brands,
like you should do more social media.
No,

1898
01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:23.290
they say,
uh,
you know,
don't,

1899
01:52:23.291 --> 01:52:26.770
one of the most valuable things you could do is get an email list and you get a

1900
01:52:26.771 --> 01:52:28.960
big email list and you can hammer my stuff all the time,

1901
01:52:29.370 --> 01:52:33.930
Andy and you have them forever.
And I'm like,
I'm like,
Bro,
I'm,

1902
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:35.103
I'm not,

1903
01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:40.720
we're not here to just like a hammer people with whatever messaging.
Yeah.

1904
01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:45.860
So yeah,
you can sign up for it.
The email list that you made,
I mean,

1905
01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:49.310
what I put out like one thing or maybe two things on it,

1906
01:52:49.311 --> 01:52:53.900
you put out maybe two things or three things where you do one thing that you do

1907
01:52:53.901 --> 01:52:56.300
that's good as you give him,
this is the,
this is where it's beneficial.

1908
01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:00.750
If you want something you'll find out about it earlier,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh yes.

1909
01:53:00.810 --> 01:53:05.300
And also you've let the youth,
you've done some uh,
polling like,
Hey,

1910
01:53:05.301 --> 01:53:09.560
what color of this shoe we make.
So,
and that's really what it is.

1911
01:53:09.561 --> 01:53:12.860
It's more like a direct line.
Like for people who like,
like I care,

1912
01:53:12.861 --> 01:53:15.080
like if a new item comes out,
item,

1913
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:18.290
there's something new on the story comes out or something,

1914
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:21.290
something super relevant,
like I'm not going to be like,
Hey,
by the way,

1915
01:53:21.291 --> 01:53:24.500
let me just send you this that you won't read or I dunno.
Like I won't just,

1916
01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:28.280
I don't use it to,
I don't think it should be used ever,
but,

1917
01:53:28.281 --> 01:53:32.300
so I don't use it to try to like keep your attention on my website.
You know,

1918
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:36.030
it's not that I figure if I looked at it kinda like,

1919
01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:39.640
I don't know,
I forget if I heard someone say this or not,
but it was really,

1920
01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:43.120
it really made sense where you know,
when you sign up for an email list,
right?

1921
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:47.480
So a marketer,
a quote unquote marketer,
we'll look at that and be like,
okay,

1922
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:50.900
they just signed it,
signed up to be marketed to.
Right.

1923
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:55.340
So every time I enter in my email for like,
do you want updates?

1924
01:53:55.341 --> 01:53:58.420
You know how they give you my email for those things.

1925
01:53:58.430 --> 01:54:01.880
Just kind of part of the point because you know I'm signing signing up right now

1926
01:54:01.881 --> 01:54:06.860
to see marketing marketed to,
so people are gonna sign up.
They say,
okay,

1927
01:54:06.861 --> 01:54:09.010
I want to be marketed to.
I'm not going to like a beauty.

1928
01:54:09.011 --> 01:54:14.011
It's like I'm not going to instantly violate your check mailed to people if I

1929
01:54:15.321 --> 01:54:19.940
just figure if you truly believe that,
like that's what they signed up for.

1930
01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:20.931
They don't know what I'm saying.

1931
01:54:20.931 --> 01:54:25.790
Should I send out like an email of information or something?
Yeah,
yeah.

1932
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:29.750
So yeah,
exactly.
Yes.
So that's what I should do.
If if you think,
okay,

1933
01:54:29.751 --> 01:54:32.570
so think of me as like a person who's like,
hey yeah,

1934
01:54:32.690 --> 01:54:34.450
I'll sign up for this email in this aisle.

1935
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:38.050
And so I put my email in there and then so now you're contemplation.

1936
01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.920
I sent them an email.
If you think that that,

1937
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:44.840
that email legitimately is what I want to get from you when I put my email,

1938
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:47.480
then yes,
and then you go,
I don't even know what that is.

1939
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:49.370
So that's why I hardly say anything.
I just figured,
Hey,

1940
01:54:49.371 --> 01:54:53.210
if there's a new rash guard when,
especially when people on Twitter or Instagram,

1941
01:54:53.211 --> 01:54:54.021
whatever,
telling me,

1942
01:54:54.021 --> 01:54:58.280
hey do this for a rash guard or hey do this for a shirt or wear the hats coming

1943
01:54:58.281 --> 01:54:59.720
out when the Hoodie,
you know,
when's the Hoodie?

1944
01:54:59.721 --> 01:55:03.740
I've been waiting for the kids size small.

1945
01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:07.670
So for instance is a good one.
You will email when the,

1946
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:11.780
when the new hoodies are available.
When you email everyone.
Yeah.

1947
01:55:11.781 --> 01:55:15.200
And actually I did one better where I don't even have to email everybody because

1948
01:55:15.201 --> 01:55:17.690
what if people are like,
I already have a Hoodie so,

1949
01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.490
and yet they're on the list so I'll do you one better on the Hoodie on the
store.

1950
01:55:22.491 --> 01:55:26.570
When you click on the Hoodie,
select a size and it's out.
You can just be like,

1951
01:55:26.571 --> 01:55:27.710
oh put your email right there.

1952
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:32.770
You'll only get emailed if the Hoodie gets back in stock in your specific size.

1953
01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:35.720
Otherwise you don't get nothing.
I'm not going to bother your inbox.

1954
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:38.780
Your inbox is sacred.
Okay.
Just cause you gave me the key.

1955
01:55:38.781 --> 01:55:43.010
It doesn't mean to show up everyday.
Okay.
So cool.
Like that.
Yeah,
I think,

1956
01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:43.980
I think that's the

1957
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.990
<v 0>way to go.
So marketers,
whoever's listening to this right now,
that's,</v>

1958
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.430
that's like cold.
You're just missing out on so much opportunity.

1959
01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:52.200
Don't violate people's,
yeah.

1960
01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:55.900
We're not going to violate people's trust for opportunity.
Good job.
Yeah.

1961
01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.900
<v 1>Um,
but yeah,
it's good chuckles.
store.com if you need to look a checkup,</v>

1962
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:04.340
check those things out.
You know,
if he liked something,

1963
01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:08.990
get something good way to support.
Also psychological warfare.

1964
01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:11.060
If you didn't know what that is,
we all know what that is.

1965
01:56:11.090 --> 01:56:15.230
Should I even mention what it is?
You should might as the case people don't know.

1966
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:19.730
All right.
It's an album,
not a song album,
not a rap album.

1967
01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:26.000
What is it?
Good.
It's an album with tracks,

1968
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:29.090
Jocko tracks and these tracks,

1969
01:56:29.091 --> 01:56:32.000
what they are is obviously you listened to him audio tracks,
right?

1970
01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:33.420
I tunes Google,

1971
01:56:33.421 --> 01:56:38.000
play Amazon music anywhere where they sell mp3s.

1972
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:42.710
So what they are is you,
you put it in when you're,
when you're trying to get it,

1973
01:56:42.711 --> 01:56:43.760
like you set a goal,

1974
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:48.050
you're trying to get after it and you're having these moments of weakness,
diet,

1975
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:52.850
workout.
Uh,
getting up,
staying discipline,
creative,
procrastination,
all this,

1976
01:56:52.851 --> 01:56:56.090
all these points of weakness that you can encounter.

1977
01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:00.230
There's a track for one of them.
Boom.
You listened to it and it's booked.

1978
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:04.490
It's kind of like Jocko at your fingertips in a way where you saying

1979
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:08.390
you're like,
hey,
chocolate.
Okay,
so I have this luxury.

1980
01:57:08.391 --> 01:57:13.280
I can call you up and be like,
hey,
you know,
tonight,
uh,
I had uh,
I dunno,

1981
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:16.070
stressful day and I still got some work to do.

1982
01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:21.260
I'm thinking of going to Vons and getting some vodka I don't want tomorrow.

1983
01:57:21.261 --> 01:57:25.610
I don't want to look back and be like,
I wish I wouldn't have drank vodka.

1984
01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.490
But right now I really want to go get that fat guy.

1985
01:57:28.491 --> 01:57:31.490
And it's very powerful and I think he'd do me some good,
really.

1986
01:57:31.491 --> 01:57:35.930
Some stuff I have the luxury of being able to call you up and be like,
hey,

1987
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:40.160
boom.
And then you can just tell me,
explain to me pragmatically,

1988
01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:43.310
why shouldn't I do that?
I'll pretty thanks Jocko.
Boom.
I don't get the vodka.

1989
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:47.090
A lot of people don't have that.
Get psychological warfare.
You do have that.

1990
01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:50.840
You just put in the track.
Boom.
You'll wake up early every single time.

1991
01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:53.130
If you're not feeling like waking up early,
you'll wake up.

1992
01:57:53.131 --> 01:57:57.230
Her same thing with worked out.
Same thing with procrastination,
all that stuff.

1993
01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:59.150
Anyway,
check them all out.
See if you like it.

1994
01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:01.970
Get one of those 100% effectiveness.

1995
01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:05.810
If you still slack after listening to this.
I said this before,
I'll say it again.

1996
01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:10.520
There's a problem.
I don't think you will.

1997
01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:14.950
<v 0>So there is no problem.
There you go.
Oh,
that's a good one.
Good support.
Right on.</v>

1998
01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:19.350
Uh,
also you can get Jocko white tea on Amazon.
Speaking of Amazon,

1999
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:21.660
you can get Jocko white tea that you shouldn't drink it.

2000
01:58:21.690 --> 01:58:25.950
If you want a dead lift more than 7,000,
854 pounds,

2001
01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.640
cause that's what you will be able to do as soon as you drink your first sip to

2002
01:58:29.641 --> 01:58:33.000
guaranteed 100%.
Uh,

2003
01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:36.180
Jocko white tea tastes good and it makes you feel good and it's good for you.

2004
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:41.160
So get that books.
I got some books.
One was called way of the warrior kid.

2005
01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:46.810
It's for kids.
But I think we can all learn from it.

2006
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:50.440
I know I learned from it from good old uncle Jake got a book called extreme

2007
01:58:50.441 --> 01:58:54.070
ownership,
which is a book about leadership,
combat leadership lessons learned.

2008
01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:59.580
Also have a book called discipline equals freedom field manual just came out

2009
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:03.340
October 17th I'm going to read you a little excerpt.

2010
01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:07.210
First excerpt coming from the,
and the reason I'm reading this is

2011
01:59:09.570 --> 01:59:12.370
a few weeks ago there was a mass shooting in Vegas.

2012
01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:15.220
Horrible situation and

2013
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:22.540
ideal talk about all kinds of different things in this book about my life,

2014
01:59:22.541 --> 01:59:25.420
things I've learned and one of the things,

2015
01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:27.760
one of the sections in here is called immediate action drills.

2016
01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:30.790
Here we go back to the book,

2017
01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:35.560
but we can't always avoid high threat areas and sometimes the high threat area

2018
01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:40.270
doesn't avoid us in the world today,
conflict and danger can occur at anytime,

2019
01:59:40.271 --> 01:59:41.104
anywhere,

2020
01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:45.400
so it is important to maintain situational awareness at all times.

2021
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:48.580
Pay attention to your surroundings,
look at suspicious people,

2022
01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:53.710
look at UNCC suspicious people.
What are they doing?
Where are they going?

2023
01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:58.780
What are they looking at?
Assess while you assess.

2024
01:59:58.870 --> 02:00:03.460
Think of contingencies.
Where is your closest escape route?

2025
02:00:03.970 --> 02:00:06.730
Where is the closest cover and concealment?

2026
02:00:06.850 --> 02:00:11.710
Cover being a place to shield you from bullets and concealment being a place to

2027
02:00:11.711 --> 02:00:15.880
hide.
If you are maintaining situational awareness,

2028
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:18.160
you should be very hard to surprise.

2029
02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:22.120
If you send something is going wrong or you sense a threat,

2030
02:00:22.121 --> 02:00:26.080
proactively move away from it.
Walk to the other side of the street.

2031
02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:31.000
Accelerate your car,
walk out the door.
Don't wait for things to get worse.

2032
02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.120
If you do get surprised and are caught in a bad situation,
act.

2033
02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:40.690
If you can run away from an assailant,
do it.

2034
02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:44.530
If you can't run because they have a hold on,
you attack them.

2035
02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:50.080
Put all your training to use as quickly and as violently as possible.

2036
02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:53.110
As soon as you can break free,
do it and run.

2037
02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:54.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2038
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:57.380
<v 0>If shooting starts,
get down,</v>

2039
02:00:58.550 --> 02:01:00.440
call the police at the first opportunity.

2040
02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:04.700
If the shooting is single shots being fired at a slower pace,

2041
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:07.190
run immediately and keep running.

2042
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:13.100
If the shooting is rapid fire,
find some solid cover to get behind.

2043
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:17.990
Wait for a lull.
When the low comes run,

2044
02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:20.150
that may be your only chance.

2045
02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.280
If you are trapped in a room with an active shooter outside barricade yourself.

2046
02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:30.120
If there is no,
if there is an ideal hiding place,

2047
02:01:30.210 --> 02:01:34.440
hide if not prepared to attack them as soon as they enter the room.

2048
02:01:34.650 --> 02:01:39.030
Get anyone in the room with you on board and ready to swarm the attacker.

2049
02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.670
So those are some notes from where to start.

2050
02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:52.480
And again you can take training for those types of situations to a very high

2051
02:01:52.551 --> 02:01:54.260
degree.
But if you have no training,

2052
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:56.720
you need to know what to do in those situations.

2053
02:01:57.110 --> 02:02:01.100
That's that's why I put that in there.
Um,

2054
02:02:01.610 --> 02:02:05.150
you know I will read this one more little section cause I to ask this all the

2055
02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:05.451
time,

2056
02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:08.600
I'll just do the beginning of the section dealing with injuries and illnesses.

2057
02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:13.910
What are you,
you are going to get injured.

2058
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:18.860
You are going to get sick regardless of how careful you are in your training,

2059
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:21.500
how clean you eat and how healthy you live,

2060
02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:26.620
you are still human injuries and illness will occur.

2061
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:32.510
My theory for overcoming injuries and illness is simple.

2062
02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:34.570
Do what you can.

2063
02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:35.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2064
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:37.320
<v 0>If you are sick or injured,</v>

2065
02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:41.280
don't use that as an excuse to skip workouts or stay in bed all day.

2066
02:02:41.490 --> 02:02:44.730
Do what you can.
Hurt your knee,

2067
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:49.590
work your upper body,
work the good leg,
hurt your shoulder,

2068
02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:52.440
time to work on one arm to pull ups and push ups.

2069
02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:56.160
Focus on your core and legs until your shoulder heals up.

2070
02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:59.640
Tendinitis from using the grip.

2071
02:02:59.641 --> 02:03:04.440
Too much sound like it's time to focus on sprinting and jumping.

2072
02:03:04.441 --> 02:03:08.600
Plyometrics.
Got a little cold,
flu,

2073
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:14.210
same thing.
Do what you can.
Maybe it's just going for a walk,

2074
02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:19.280
a couple sets of sit ups and pushups,
but don't just stay in bed all day.

2075
02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:23.760
So go on to talk about some more of that.

2076
02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:26.580
This book is called discipline equals freedom.
And

2077
02:03:28.230 --> 02:03:31.350
if you want to help spread the word on this,
um,

2078
02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:37.170
go in,
buy from a local bookstore like an independent bookstore.

2079
02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:39.120
Because when they sell these books,

2080
02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:44.900
they report it in such a way that it helps the book get recognized by some of

2081
02:03:45.301 --> 02:03:47.820
the bigger media outlets.

2082
02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:49.010
<v 2>Okay?</v>

2083
02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:53.690
<v 0>And when it gets recognized by some of those big media outlets like the New York</v>

2084
02:03:53.691 --> 02:03:56.900
Times or the Wall Street Journal that helps spread the word even more.

2085
02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:02.030
And I think that the word that's in this book should be spread because I think

2086
02:04:02.031 --> 02:04:05.930
it's gonna help a lot of people and I think it's gonna help them live better,

2087
02:04:06.170 --> 02:04:08.720
healthier and more productive lives.

2088
02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:12.180
So you can get that book discipline equals freedom field manual.

2089
02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:13.760
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
