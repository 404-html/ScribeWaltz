This is Jocko podcast number 65 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.790
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.370
The things they carried were largely determined by necessity among the

4
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:23.090
necessities or near necessities where 30 [inaudible] can openers,

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.020
pocket knives,
he tabs,
wrist watches,
dog tags,

6
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.730

matches,
sewing kits,

8
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.580
military payment certificates,

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.060
c rations and two or three canteens of water.

10
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.753
Together.

11
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.760
These items weighed between 12 and 18 pounds depending on a man's habits or rate

12
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.840
of metabolism.
Henry Dobbins,
who was a big man,

13
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.520
carried extra rations.

14
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.730
He was especially fond of canned peaches in heavy syrup over poundcake.

15
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.470
Dave Jensen who practiced field hygiene,
carried a toothbrush,

16
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.670
dental floss,
and several hotels sized bars of soap.

17
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.030
He'd stolen on rnr in Sydney,
Australia.

18
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.880
Ted lavender,

19
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.180
who is scared carried tranquilizers until he was shot in the head outside the

20
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:25.340
village of fate.
K in mid April

21
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.990
by necessity and because it was sop,

22
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.170
they all carried steel helmets that weighed five pounds,

23
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.900
including the liner and camouflage cover.

24
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.730
They carried the standard fatigue,
jackets and trousers.

25
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.040
Very few carried underwear on their feet.

26
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.220
They carried jungle boots 2.1 pounds and Dave Jensen carried three pairs of

27
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:56.270
socks and a can of doctor Scholls foot powder as a precaution against trench

28
00:01:56.271 --> 00:02:00.000
foot
until he was shot.

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.520
Ted lavender carried six or seven ounces of premium dope,

30
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.330
which for him was a necessity.

31
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.920
Mitchell Sanders,
the RTO carried condoms.

32
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.740
Norman [inaudible] carried a diary rat.

33
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.970
Kylie carried comic books Kiowa.

34
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.250
A devout Baptist carried an illustrated new testament that had been presented to

35
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:30.630
him by his father who taught Sunday school in Oklahoma City,

36
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.464
Oklahoma

37
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.620
as a hedge against bad times.
However,

38
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.640
Kai will also carried his grandmother's trust,

39
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.830
distrust of the white man

40
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.180
and his grandfather's old hunting hatchet.

41
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.170
Necessity dictated because the land was mined in booby trap.

42
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:58.880
There was sop for each man to carry a steel centered nylon covered flak,

43
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.120
which weighed 6.7 pounds,
but which on hot days seemed much heavier

44
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.840
because you could die so quickly.

45
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.900
Each man carried at least one large compress bandage,

46
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.810
usually in the helmet band for easy access

47
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.710
because the nights were cold and because the monsoons were wet.
Each curator,

48
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.711
green plastic Poncho that could be used as a rain coat or ground sheet or

49
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.890
makeshift tent with it's quilted liner.

50
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.960
The poncho weighed almost two pounds,

51
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.550
but it was worth every ounce in April.
For instance,

52
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.430
when Ted lavender was shot,

53
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.810
they used his Poncho to wrap him up than to carry him across the patty than to

54
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:50.170
lift him onto the chopper that took him away.

55
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.810
<v 0>And that excerpt</v>

57
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.210
is from a book called the things they carried by Tim O'brien in the book is

58
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:13.461
about the Vietnam War and it's actually a blend of nonfiction and fiction

59
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.090
and part of that blend

60
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.660
comes from what he actually experienced for real as a soldier in Vietnam in

61
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:30.640
third platoon,
Alpha company,
Fifth Battalion,

62
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.500
46th Infantry Regiment.
Incidentally,

63
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.130
he was in the same division and the same area of operations where the mee Lai

64
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.420
massacre took place.

65
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.530
And then that reality is intermingled with his thoughts and ideas and stories

66
00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:54.560
that put together a unique perspective.

67
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

68
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.210
<v 0>On War.</v>

69
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.150
But the book is considered fiction and I don't like to dig too deep on fictional

70
00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:09.440
books so I'm not going to go too deep on this one,

71
00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:13.550
but I was having a little conversation with my brother Leif Babin

72
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.200
with whom I wrote a little book called extreme ownership and Lafe and I were

73
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:26.960
talking about the things that we carried

74
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.730
and tonight we have the good fortune of having my brother Leif Babin here with

75
00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:42.251
us again today and I figured a good way to begin talking about what we carried

76
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.730
was to kind of compare and contrast what we did carry with what men like Tim

77
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.400
O'brien carried in Vietnam.
Leif Babin,

78
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.830
my brother,
welcome to the show for the third time.
Thanks for having me on.

79
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.640
Good to be back on again.
And for those of you that don't know who leaf is,

80
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.040
if you haven't been listening or you,

81
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.340
this is if this is basically the first time you've ever listened to this podcast

82
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:18.170
for some reason is because if you're not going to go life is life was in the

83
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:19.490
seal teams with me.

84
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.670
We were in the battle of Mati together and when we both got out of the military,

85
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:28.790
I retired in late life,
got out and we ended up working together.

86
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:31.640
We have a little business called echelon front where we work with companies and

87
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.790
teach leadership and management.
And we wrote a little book like I just said,

88
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:38.090
called extreme ownership.
And after actually if you want to know about life,

89
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.790
well you can read extreme ownership,

90
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.800
you can listen to podcast number 11 and podcast number 34 leaf was the first

91
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.620
guest and here he is back again.
So

92
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.930
Leif Babin,
what did you carry?

93
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.160
Talk to me about that compared to what these guys in Vietnam carried.

94
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:04.730
I mean obviously there's a lot of similarities and there's a lot of differences

95
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:07.280
too.
What do you think?
Definitely.

96
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.100
I mean it brings back so many memories just thinking about all the stuff that we

97
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:14.870
carried and uh,
with us and uh,
and the,
the burden of the,

98
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:18.680
you know,
just the heavy,
you know,
we used to joke about stuff,
body armor back,

99
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:18.950
you know,

100
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.370
in the body armor is just biting into your traps after you've had it on for

101
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:25.850
hours and hours of the helmets,
just the vice down on your head.

102
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.150
And obviously we had to train and prepare so that we,
we could,

103
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.690
we could prepare to have loose things off for hours and hours on end and be able

104
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:35.330
to deal with that.
And um,
in fact,

105
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:40.160
I remember you being the only guy in the universe that actually liked a certain

106
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:43.550
type of headset that we were using because it actually crushed down on your

107
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.230
skull and it was like,
bring it good.

108
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.800
Everyone else is complaining about it and you're like,
you're like,

109
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.810
I actually like this.
Ah,
that thing hurt my head.

110
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.350
I would never have admitted it back then.
But yeah,
it hurt bad.

111
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.520
It would squeeze your head in that awkward way and it was bad.
That was a,

112
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.200
that was a gnarly old headset but

113
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.740
a lot heavier because the body armor where we're at,
how much did,

114
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.900
how much did our body or on her way,

115
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.950
and it was like seven pounds of plate and you've got a front back plate and then

116
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:14.690
you've got the nine mil body armor and you're that that right there is heavy.

117
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.930
And then the funny thing is we were able to make our weapons a little bit

118
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:18.651
lighter over time,

119
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:21.140
but then we've decked him all out with lasers and optics and everything.

120
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:24.290
So the weapons,
I bet you are,
our weapons were actually heavier.
Definitely.

121
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:26.030
And then like for me,
um,
you know,
we,

122
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:29.060
we had trained to carry those little 10 inch barreled.
Uh,

123
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.010
we have an m four for the tenants,
Brill,

124
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:35.300
which we use for a close quarters combat you house clearance and,
and uh,

125
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.020
as you know,
that was like the primary weapon and we get to robotic.
I was like,

126
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:40.640
Hey,
I got to carry my 14 hits bureau,

127
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:44.210
which is longer and it's got an m two o three grenade launcher on it.

128
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.190
So you've got a 40 millimeter grenade and that's what becomes,

129
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.440
comes a lot heavier.
A based on that.
I just,

130
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:52.400
I needed that to be able to throw some 40 Mike Mike down.
Now,

131
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:54.770
one of the things that I know was,
uh,

132
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.650
mean we all learned a lot in combat and actually Andy Stumpf was just on and,

133
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.870
and I know you're friends with him too,

134
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:05.580
but we were talking about the learning curve of how quickly you learn things and

135
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:09.540
I know you,
you learn some pretty,
pretty solid and,

136
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.340
and rough lessons out of the gate going on to big patrols.
Right,
right,
right.

137
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:19.230
When we got there.
And just specifically about what you carried.
Absolutely.

138
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:21.750
I mean,
we had,
you know,

139
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.870
we had to focus so much on doing a roll up of salt.

140
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.460
We're loading up in vehicles so you're not,

141
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.370
you don't have to carry much on your person because a,
we're,
we're trying to,
to,

142
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.190
to drive up and vehicles and so we get to Ramadi and of course we'd done our

143
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.100
patrols out of a desert,
done that,
that training and prepared for that.

144
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.050
But we think we're good on Iraq and we're going to,

145
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:42.330
we're going to drive and vehicles and we get to Ramadi.

146
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:46.170
And these ideas are so dangerous and killing people.

147
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.840
So what do you do?
You get out of the vehicle and you patrol,

148
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.350
which means if you're going into an area and you got to carry everything on your

149
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:55.080
back and you've got to carry enough water and all the stuff you've got to have

150
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:59.640
for the next 24,
even 48 hours,
it's a lot of stuff.
And one of the,

151
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.930
the first patrols,
uh,
I've done a few patrols on kind of the outskirts of town,

152
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.471
you know,
but,

153
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:09.471
but that city center where it was al Qaeda control battlespace and US troops

154
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:15.180
were dying,
uh,
an almost everyday and this horrible violent place.

155
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.650
We've been on the ground for a,
I think a couple of weeks,
uh,
in and,
uh,

156
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.920
and we were teaming up with a marine unit from three,
eight Marines,

157
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:24.570
third battalion,
Eighth Marines,

158
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:29.550
Outstanding Group of warriors who've been on the ground for a month or two prior

159
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:30.750
to us getting there.
And they were,

160
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.110
these guys were in the thick of the fight and uh,
they were,

161
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.830
they had adjusted their tactics and learned how to go out there and,
and uh,

162
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.860
and conduct these patrols as we were teaming up with them to go into an area

163
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:44.370
called firecracker circle as firecracker is in,
hey,

164
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:49.371
this is a happy place with 4th of July or firecrackers and massive bombs as in

165
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:53.170
there's a 400 pound explosive in the road that's going to blow your vehicle a

166
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.270
hundred feet in the air and kill everybody there.

167
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:59.070
That was that area of firecracker.
They did not,
as a matter of fact,
when we,

168
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.790
even later than this,
when you were looking at doing operations in there,

169
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.070
and I remember sitting there with the Marines going,
hey,

170
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:08.010
what's the QRF situation?
Who can come in and get us?
And they were like,
hey look,

171
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.810
we're not coming in there with vehicles unless they're like,
hey,

172
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:17.090
if it's an absolute worst case scenario and you got to get somebody Kaz of act

173
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.000
immediately,

174
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.760
but if you get a guy get shot in the leg and you can stop the bleeding,

175
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.320
you're going to wait until nighttime.

176
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.830
They were adamant about not going in there because it was so bad.
I mean,

177
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:27.990
they patrolled in there all the time,
which you're about to talk about,

178
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.450
but nobody wanted to bring vehicles up in those streets.

179
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.030
And actually part of that reason is because just before we got there,

180
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:33.920
they took a massive I,

181
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.100
the Marine Corps took a massive idea and I think the last four or five marines

182
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:42.060
in one shot just juiced to total travesty.
That was right as we were arriving.

183
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:45.270
We hearing the stories about that and read the reports on it and a horrible,

184
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:46.530
horrible deal.
But that was it.

185
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.990
That was a great tactic that we learned from the Marines,

186
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.710
which is listen to the bad guys.
They want to blow you up in the streets.

187
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.190
They're going to try to target your vehicles,

188
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.850
<v 2>they're going to try to ambush you.
So when you're in a building and a sniper,</v>

189
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:01.780
Overwatch position and you're behind concrete walls,
like stay in that position,

190
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.370
stay in that position,
unless you have an urgent surgical casually,

191
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:09.190
you've got to get out right now or you gotta be overrun only an extreme

192
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:09.761
situation.

193
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:13.570
So we're not going to call in the QRF cause they're gonna blow up the vehicles

194
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:14.740
and that's what they want you to do.

195
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.900
And they taught us some of those things that were,
uh,

196
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.520
that helped keep our guys alive and certainly helped us,
uh,
perfect.
Our,
our,
uh,

197
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:24.040
our,
our tactics,
techniques and procedures to be able to,

198
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.290
to go deep into those areas and,
and uh,

199
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.760
and do some real damage to the enemy and most of the time bring our Gesso.

200
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.650
So,
so speaking of going deep,

201
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.440
how deep did you have to dig on that first patrol out with three?

202
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.870
So we're going into this area.
We just,
you know,

203
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:42.490
these marines are just lost guys in and we were going in with Lima Company,

204
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.410
Outstanding Group of Warriors.
Uh,
and,
and you know,

205
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:46.780
we were excited to go in and work with them.
So I've got a,
you know,

206
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:49.270
we got to about a squad of,
uh,
of seals going in.

207
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:51.520
We've got some Iraqi soldiers and we're going to team up and we're going to put

208
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:56.380
in some mutually supporting sniper,
Overwatch positions,
uh,
and remain in,
uh,

209
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.960
uh,
through,
through,
we'd go in at nighttime,

210
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:01.930
we'd remained through the day and we come out the next night.
So I'm like,
Hey,

211
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:04.330
I'm going in there.
We may be in there for 24 hours.

212
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:06.940
It could even be longer if we get delayed.
And you know what,

213
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.880
this is a bad area and nobody can come,
come get us out.

214
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.200
So I'm load now for world war three and you know,

215
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.920
my first time going to these areas,
I mean,

216
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.410
I'm packing hand grenades and extra mags and you know,

217
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:23.380
our typical load out was two hand grenades.
And I think I added a,

218
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.460
I added like three or five extra Hagar mates that I was bringing in.

219
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.370
So I put that in my bag.
I'm bringing,
I've got eggs,
you know,

220
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.120
my typical Lexi laughing about this because we've done a lot talk about world

221
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:39.121
war one and they had grenade battles like trench to trench grenade battles.

222
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.510
And I don't even think if I was going into our grenade battle where that was my

223
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:46.060
primary weapon,
I would have seven grenades.

224
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:50.860
Like life was carried right into Ramadi bridge.
It's awesome.
So I'm getting,

225
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:53.610
I'm getting ready,
I'm getting ready to get some.
And uh,
you know,
I'm,

226
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:56.320
I'm thinking metaphor.
We've were getting overrun and we're loading up on it.

227
00:13:56.321 --> 00:13:59.650
So it's like one more thing,
one more thing,
you know,
extra mag here,

228
00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:03.640
extra mag there.
So,
you know,
I've got,
I've got those extra hand grenades,

229
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.230
I've got the extra uh,
smoke grenades.
I've got,
uh,
you know,

230
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.000
I've got flash bang grenades.
I've got,
I've got,
you know,

231
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.910
four or five extra magazines in addition to like the seven magazines.

232
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.660
Each of these are 30 round magazines.
Be Curious.

233
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.280
I that a my class at least it sounds crazy amount of.

234
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.720
And then of course I've got my,
I'm carrying my 40 Mike,
Mike,
right?

235
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:26.490
So I've got 40 millimeter grenades as well and a,
and I was typically,
you know,

236
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:30.250
I'm,
I'm loading that out.
So,
so I've got a bandolier of 12 of those things.

237
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:34.750
I think I had six more on me,
um,
in,
in,
in a pouch on my waist.

238
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.131
So literally,
I mean,

239
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:41.131
I'm rolling in like John Jay Rambo style ready to get some so that this

240
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:42.110
seriously,
you know,

241
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.560
as I'm sitting here thinking that must've been a hundred pounds worth of gear

242
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.600
with your body armor,
all those grenades,
smoke grenades,
40 Mike,
Mike,

243
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.710
you must have had it at least close to 100 pounds I think.

244
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.390
I think easy because then you tack on water,
you know,

245
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:59.160
that was the biggest limiting factor for us.
I mean,
you know,
and you've got the,

246
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.930
the summertime heat over there.
It's just,
just unbearable.
You know,

247
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:07.550
may hit 115 hundred 20 degrees and uh,
so we're here we are,
remain over day.

248
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.360
You're not gonna drink the water out of the Faucet,
you know,

249
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.170
unless you want to be,
unless you want to be visiting the,

250
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.020
making some frequent head gauze and having some,
some,
uh,
dysentery for the next,

251
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:21.800
uh,
next few days.
Uh,
and what that's going to bring you.
So,
um,

252
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.600
so you got to get to carry that water in.
You know,

253
00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:26.020
we carry these leader and a half bottles that they had.

254
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.120
I think I had probably 10 or 12 of those models too.
So I'm like,

255
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.500
I don't want to run out of water so I can give you a bunch more,
you know,

256
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.610
that even thought I need it.
So ridiculous amount of weight that I'm cured.

257
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.080
And so we load it up.
I mean I'm,
I'm having a hard time even just,
you know,

258
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.630
picking this bag up.
But it in,
so we loaded when our vehicles,
we drive,

259
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:42.650
we meet up with the marines,

260
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.850
we're loading up into their big seven ton trucks that they took in and they put

261
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:49.700
the troops in the back,
these huge vehicles and that that was,

262
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.820
they would kind of drive you on the outskirts of the batteries on roads had

263
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:56.030
cleared.
Um,
and hopefully you are protected and you know,
in those,

264
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.820
in those vehicles from the armor.
Then we unload,

265
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.120
we loaded unloaded from the vehicles once we got to a point.

266
00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:06.130
And just so everyone knows these are like mad max scenario vehicles that,
that,

267
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.120
that people,
military guys had had put steel on the sides,

268
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:11.510
you know,

269
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.280
half inch steel on the side to protect from rounds with sandbags on the floor.

270
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.700
You know,
just put sandbags all over the floor.
So it's not like when,
when,

271
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:23.070
when he's talking about an armored vehicle,
don't think of a tank or,

272
00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:26.780
or a Bradley fighting vehicle.
He's talking about a mad max scenario.

273
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.550
Big giant seven ton truck.
It looks like a construction truck basically,

274
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:35.520
but it's got big steel walls on it and now they put sandbags on the Florida

275
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.540
prevent from ids and that's going to war in the fun way straight,

276
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.390
straight out of the road warrior.
Definitely.
Um,

277
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.950
and so we get dropped off from those,

278
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.750
those vehicles and of course we're kitting up.
And you know,

279
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:49.670
as soon as I'm putting this thing on,
I'm like,
man,
I'm Karen,

280
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.700
I can't wait to drink this water.
You know,
uh,

281
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:55.800
I can't wait to try to shoot some of these rounds,
you know,
get,

282
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.520
get rid of some of this way.
Cause I realized like it's,
it's crazy.

283
00:16:58.521 --> 00:17:01.640
It's a crazy man.
Of course you're like,
you know,
you don't want to run a Ammo,

284
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.330
but she also,
you know,
you,
you can't,
if you can't move then it,

285
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.020
the more dangerous.
So we started to patrol and we're moving in the area and uh,

286
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.040
and,
and the Marines who,
who'd spent time on the ground,
I was,
I talked about,

287
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:15.550
I mean their,
their method of patrol because there were a lot of enemies,

288
00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:17.390
snipers out there.
And even though it's nighttime,

289
00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:19.280
you know there's still some street lights and things like that.

290
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.660
So then method of patrol is two man shooter,

291
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.730
Paris and there those guys got each other's backs.

292
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.490
You got two guys covering two different directions and they're holding on a on a

293
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:31.010
on a street corner and,

294
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.060
and then they're waiting for the next a shooter pair that's up to the next block

295
00:17:35.061 --> 00:17:40.061
from them and they sprint all out mad dash sprint as fast as you can go as fast

296
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:44.330
as you can run from one corner to the next corner,

297
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.170
maybe 100 million are covering sprint as exactly here.
And some of those blocks,

298
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:51.960
maybe it's 50 hours,
some moments a hundred yards.
But you know,

299
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.280
and this is how they patrol into the city.
So it's,
it is your,

300
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.770
your sprint hold sprint whole sprint hole and you know,

301
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.130
a few blocks of going into that and we're kind of moving around the city and

302
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.530
misdirection is like,
man,
I am smoked,

303
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:07.740
I'm having a hard time keeping up and just my hats,
these,

304
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:11.310
these young marines that are just getting after it,
carrying heavy,

305
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.700
heavy equipment and gear and the,
the radio men and the gack here in his,

306
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:18.000
you know,
his 40 Mike,
Mike,
and they're of course they're carrying the two,
uh,

307
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.650
two 40 bravo machine gun,
which is a,
uh,
a belt finishing it.

308
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.400
That was much heavier than what,
what uh,

309
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.390
are you ma mark 48 slide are machine guns were,
uh,
for,

310
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.600
for our meeting machine guns.
But,
um,
those guys were just awesome.

311
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.630
Just awesome trying to,
you know,
trying to work with them.
But I am,

312
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.350
I am having one hell of a time trying to keep up with these guys.

313
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.580
So what does that do to your,
uh,
what's that do to your leadership capability?

314
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:44.690
Wouldn't here?
Well,
here I'm,
I'm tired here.

315
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.370
I'm supposed to be in charge of this thing.
So I'm in charge of this.

316
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.520
I'm in charge of my guys,
you know,
we've got a squad of eight of our guys,

317
00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:53.250
eight seals and,
and uh,
you know,
does and Iraqi soldiers.
So,

318
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.280
and I'm supposed to be in charge.

319
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.100
I'm supposed to be thinking about the bigger picture and be able to detach and

320
00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:02.060
all the things that we talk about sitting back and thinking about,
you know,
uh,

321
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.970
what's going on,
you know,
a half mile up the road and in making,
you know,
uh,

322
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:08.820
radio calls back to the tactical operations center and talking to you and

323
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:11.610
telling you where we are and what's going on.
And I can't,
I'm,

324
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.970
I'm focused at this point on putting one foot in front of the other,

325
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.020
just head down,
one foot in front of the other and just try to keep up,
you know.

326
00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:21.840
And here I am,
the guy just having a hard time keeping up.
And it was,

327
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.700
it was humbling,
humbling experience for me.
Here I am,
uh,
a seal,

328
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:31.140
a team guy thinking I'm in shape and uh,
you know,
and I'm in an area where,

329
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.170
you know,
I'm not a climatize to this kind of brutal heat.

330
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.180
Even at nighttime it's 95 degrees outside,
you know,
and there's no wind,
no wind,

331
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.900
no wind.
And you think,
oh,
it's a dry heat in the desert.
No,

332
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:48.180
the river's like,
you know,
just,
it's not a dry yeah,
right.
Yeah.
We were half,

333
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:50.590
you know,
half a mile off the river,
so it's,
it's,

334
00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:53.580
it's humid along along the river.
So,
uh,
it was,

335
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.390
it was horrible and I was realizing like this,
I got my ass kicked.
I mean,

336
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:59.970
it was by the time we got back from that,
it was,

337
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.470
I knew I was going into a heavy,
like heat exhaust,
like I was,

338
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:08.580
I was hitting the like the heat exhaustion point.
Whereas like this is rough.

339
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.121
This is rough.

340
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:13.170
And that's the thing that's scary about heat exhaustion scenarios is it's like a

341
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.340
cliff you're walking off of.

342
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.130
And when you're getting close to the cliff and when you go off of it,

343
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.790
it's not like you say,
okay,
let me get a sip of water.
No,
you're in big trouble.

344
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.950
You got guys carrying you now cause you,
you know,

345
00:20:22.951 --> 00:20:25.350
if you get heat stroke or heat exhaustion,
it's own bad,

346
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:27.810
bad situation and it doesn't matter how tough you are,

347
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.920
you're not going to be able to power through that.
Right.
Physically.
Uh,
it,

348
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.670
and so that's what,
you know,

349
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.330
that's a nightmare scenario for me that here I am the leader and yet if I can't

350
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:39.450
keep up with someone has to carry me.
Right.
That was a,

351
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:43.770
that was just going to be a horrific disaster.
So we went to that operation.

352
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:46.950
We were out there for a,
you know,
uh,
remained throughout the course of the,

353
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.650
the day daylight we got shot at,
we shot it some bad guys.
And uh,

354
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:54.340
and then we came out,
you know,
the next night and uh,
I got back from that.

355
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:57.960
I was like aggressively returning fire or some of those rounds.
We definitely,

356
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.150
Chris unfortunately didn't get a chance to throw any of the hand grenades,

357
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.800
which was a real bummer.
Um,
but,
uh,
yeah,
I mean it was,

358
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.780
it was a real rude awakening for me,

359
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.810
just being humbled by that experience to come back and think I'm carrying way

360
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:17.320
too much stuff.
I can't,
you know,
it's,
it's,
sure I don't want to run out of Ammo,

361
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.520
you know,
and,
but,

362
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.930
but how much more dangerous is it for me to be carrying so much stuff that I

363
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:26.230
can't even keep up on a patrol.
I can't move fast when I need to.

364
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.740
And if bad guy starts shooting at us,
I can't get my guys off the street,

365
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:32.800
you know,
or I can't move,
run across the street or run up the stairs and,

366
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.380
and so I recognized right away like,
I've got to,

367
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.490
I got a pair of this down and I got to carry just the essential stuff and maybe

368
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.660
a couple of contingency plans.
Like maybe I got one extra grenade,

369
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.610
my in my backpack.
Um,
and maybe I don't even need that,
you know?
Um,

370
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.450
what do I really absolutely need?
You know,

371
00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:52.240
don't want to run out of water out there.
So maybe I got one extra bottle.

372
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.020
Don't need for,
you know,
um,
with me.
And,
and that enabled me to,

373
00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.090
to recognize that I've got to carry only the essential stuff cause you can

374
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.980
absolutely get overwhelmed.
Um,
and part of that too,
if you're,
you know,

375
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.110
we were training,
we trained at La land warfare at the time,
you know,

376
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:13.120
what was the attitude was we do land warfare in the seal teams.
So we don't,

377
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.430
we don't wear a helmet,
body armor for land warfare.

378
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.160
So we'll go out and patrol across the desert and do that stuff.
We wear a helmet,

379
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.440
body armor when we do CQC,
close quarters combat in the,
in the kill house.

380
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.560
And you know,
here we are in an urban environment like,
God,

381
00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:27.730
I've got to be able to do both.

382
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.950
I'm foot patrolling and then we're clearing houses.
Yeah.

383
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.160
So got to have that stuff.
Uh,
and,

384
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:35.260
and you just recognize how you just cannot carry all that stuff with you.

385
00:22:35.261 --> 00:22:37.120
So that was the rude awakening for me.

386
00:22:37.121 --> 00:22:39.580
And the other piece of that was physical training.
You know,

387
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:44.320
here I was thinking I'm in shape,
I'm a team guy,
you know,
uh,
we train hard,

388
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:48.470
we pushed the envelope and yet I am not in good enough shape to be able to,

389
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.100
to perform at the level I need to in this kind of heat,

390
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:53.320
in this kind of environment.
You know,
and after that,
you know,

391
00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:57.120
you would see now it was a lesson,
not just me learn,
but I,
I saw so many reasons.

392
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.390
It's your rosary,
you showed up if you showed up at like noon,
uh,

393
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:06.100
if the heat of the day you'd see guys out doing tire flips,
doing,
do you know,

394
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:11.020
sprints running,
uh,
working out to get a climatized to be ready for those,

395
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.780
those worst case scenarios.
And we recognize that.

396
00:23:13.781 --> 00:23:16.540
We thought we were good and we had to step it up to two uneven.

397
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.200
I actually took one of those workouts and I would do that at,

398
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.250
at victory and Mariana training fighters book the workout was,
it was uh,
uh,

399
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.070
a dummy carry cause we had a big old heavy bag.
So it was a dummy carry,

400
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.490
carry it down and back,
Sprint as hard as you can.
Then grab the tire.

401
00:23:33.491 --> 00:23:36.100
It was a tire pull down and back and then a sprint down and back.

402
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.810
And what that was stimulating it was like,
okay,

403
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:40.570
you might have to pick up a guy and carry him down or carry them somewhere.

404
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.140
Then you also might have to grab a guy and drag him and then you might just have

405
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:46.580
to sprint.
But was we do that,
like you said,

406
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:49.280
we do that stuff at high noon cause cause like you said,

407
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:52.400
everyone wanted to be acclimated for the worst case scenario and that was

408
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:54.710
something we saw over and over again.
Even the,
by the way,

409
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:57.500
I remember you run in those,
I remember you run in Dean through that,
uh,

410
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.150
do that training.
It was brutal.
I was like that's rough.
That's rough thing.

411
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.680
A good training,
awesome training.
Prepare you for those worst case scenarios.

412
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:11.000
But we,
it was humbling and we'd see,
you know,
we'd have great team guys,

413
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:12.170
brothers who showed up,
you know,

414
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.680
in her body and want to go out on patrol with us guys who we knew were

415
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:20.250
incredibly fit,
great athletes,
kept himself in shape.
Um,

416
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.670
these certainly worth of guys that let themselves go and we take 'em out on a

417
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:25.100
patrol and like they'd be falling back.
You know,

418
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:26.870
they'd be having a hard time keeping up.
They'd have,

419
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.450
they had to learn that same lesson that I learned.
Uh,

420
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:31.460
and then you'd see him after getting after it,
right?

421
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.500
Like training and pushing the envelope.

422
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.530
And I think that was a lesson that we learned,

423
00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:39.740
some great tactics for the marines and also got my hats off to those young

424
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:42.380
marines that were,
that were getting out there in the thick of it.

425
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:43.820
They taught me some,
some,
uh,

426
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.860
some great lessons there that enabled us to go forward and,
and,
uh,
really a push,

427
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.720
you know,
push the envelope going deep and areas that nobody could get into.
Um,

428
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.400
and setting up the sniper Overwatch is,
and help and protect it.

429
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:58.070
The soldiers and marines that were building those combat outposts.
Uh,

430
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.310
but we had to be physically fit and we had to carry on the,

431
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.880
the essential gear that we needed a new,
what's interesting,

432
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:06.470
I'm sitting over here cause we,
you know,

433
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.620
obviously we're in a business consulting business,

434
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:14.830
but same thing that we'll see with businesses when they want,

435
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.420
they want to do the same thing.

436
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.110
They want to build their infrastructure so much that they can handle any

437
00:25:21.111 --> 00:25:22.220
scenario that's going to happen.

438
00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:25.160
So they're going to hire three more people in case of this and the hire six more

439
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:29.780
people for that and they'll hire four more people for that,
for that contingency,

440
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.650
right?
It's like you saying,
well I might run out of magazines,

441
00:25:32.651 --> 00:25:36.020
I'm going to put five more in my backpack and I might throw these four grenades

442
00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:38.570
so I need three more months.
And next thing you know,
these companies,

443
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:40.760
they're so overburdened with,

444
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.360
with overhead and with cost structure that the same thing happens.

445
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:48.770
What happens is they lose their ability to maneuver.
And so it's the same thing.

446
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:51.560
You take that combat principle of carry what you need.

447
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.860
Think about it and don't carry too much.

448
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.550
And you'd apply that to the business world.
Hey,

449
00:25:56.551 --> 00:26:01.190
if you don't need to bring that extra person on board and you can get away with

450
00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:03.830
a contractor for a little while and you can pay somebody some overtime,

451
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.970
do that until you have to make that decision.
And you'll know.

452
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.800
So that's something you actually taught me,
uh,
in,
in Ramadi.
You know,
we,

453
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.300
uh,
you,
you can't,

454
00:26:14.301 --> 00:26:17.480
you had been in Baghdad and had those good experiences of these capture kill

455
00:26:17.481 --> 00:26:22.070
raids and,
and uh,
it,
it always seemed like we're,
we're going in this house,

456
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:23.060
we don't know what's in that house.

457
00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:26.030
We know we believe a bad guy to be there and maybe has some people.
So,

458
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.050
so I'm going to put 25 assaulters in that house and you know,

459
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:32.600
I'm going to put as many people as I can.
And then you're like,
hey,

460
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.240
I don't think you need that many people.
And initially I was like,
that's crazy.

461
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.530
Why would I not want to take them all?

462
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.210
And then you recognize like 25 people in the house.
There's a lot more may him.

463
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.860
There's a lot more chaos.
There's people bumping each other and you're like,

464
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.860
<v 0>yeah,
maybe,
maybe 14 guys is all I need.
You know,
for this particular target.</v>

465
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:52.080
Guess what else?
When you're on this target,
where's the biggest threat?

466
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.100
The biggest threat actually oftentimes isn't in the building you're taking down.

467
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.350
Cause you're doing that aggressively.
You have a good force.

468
00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.100
The harder threat to co,
you know where the threat is.
A building is,
you know,

469
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.860
480 square feet or 1,400 square feet.
You know how big that puts a,

470
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.410
it's a,
it's a finite area.
Whereas when you're in the street,

471
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.410
360 degrees,
that threats there.

472
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.000
So where do you actually need people to cover a threat that you don't know and

473
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.240
don't understand?
You need them in the streets.
That's where you need them.

474
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:24.570
And that's where we always went heavy on the streets and at the assault team is

475
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:29.340
a smaller package and plus it's very easy and very controlled.
To be able to say,

476
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.410
Jocko,
I need four more guys in here.
Boom,

477
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:35.670
you got them super is doing the opposite.
Hey,
send four guys out in the street.

478
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:39.420
We don't know where but send guys out.
It's,
it's totally,
it's much more hard.

479
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.900
It's much harder to do that because it's a much less controlled situation out in

480
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:45.810
the streets.
And I think for leaders,
that planning piece,
right?

481
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:48.360
To think about where is that contingency,
what,

482
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.060
what are the likely the tendencies that may happen.
So yeah,

483
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:54.990
keep that essential personnel,
essential resources,
uh,
and focus.

484
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.450
You can't plan for every contingency and if you do,

485
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.370
you're going to overwhelm your team.
Uh,
and,
and it's going to,

486
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.040
it's going to cause more problems trying to,

487
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:06.720
trying to solve every contingency then,
uh,
that it wouldn't otherwise.
Yeah.
Yeah.

488
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.250
All right.
That's good.
That's good stuff.
You know what,

489
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:14.130
I'm do go back to the book right now.

490
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:21.100
Here we go.
They were called legs or grunts

491
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.640
to carry something was to hump it as when Lieutenant Jimmy Cross humped his love

492
00:28:29.261 --> 00:28:32.410
for Martha up the hills and through the swamps.

493
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:33.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

494
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:38.210
<v 0>Almost everyone.
Humped photographs in his wallet.</v>

495
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:41.660
Lieutenant Cross carry two photographs of Marfa.

496
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.880
As a first lieutenant and platoon leader,
Jimmy Cross carried a compass map,

497
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.430
code books,
binoculars,

498
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:55.230
and a 45 caliber pistol that weighed 2.9 pounds fully loaded.

499
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.460
He carried a strobe light and the responsibility for the lives of his men

500
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:08.400
as an Rto.
Mitchell Sanders carried the PRC 25 radio,

501
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:13.610
a killer 26 pounds with its battery as a medic rat.

502
00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:18.831
Kylie carried a canvas satchel filled with morphine and plasma and malaria

503
00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:23.730
tablets and surgical tape and comic books and all the things a medic must carry,

504
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.470
including m and m's for a specialty bad wounds for a total weight of nearly 18

505
00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:33.170
pounds
as a big man.

506
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.630
Therefore,
a machine gunner,

507
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.980
Henry [inaudible] Dobbins carried the [inaudible],

508
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.340
which weighed 20 pounds unloaded,

509
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:47.080
but which was almost always loaded.
In addition,

510
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:52.230
Dobbins carried between 10 15 pounds of ammunition draped in belts across his

511
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:54.520
chest and shoulders.

512
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.300
They all carried ghosts.
When dark came,

513
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.580
they would move out single file across the meadows and patties to their ambush

514
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:11.581
coordinates where they would quietly set up the claymores and lied down and

515
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:12.790
spend the night

516
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.013
<v 1>waiting</v>

517
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.370
<v 0>in that section.</v>

518
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.250
When I was reading that clearly this is very similar to the operations that you

519
00:30:26.251 --> 00:30:29.220
conducted a tone of which was,
you know,

520
00:30:29.221 --> 00:30:33.600
they're calling them ambushes here and we called them sniper Overwatch's but the

521
00:30:33.601 --> 00:30:34.434
idea,

522
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.640
<v 1>hmm.</v>

523
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.990
<v 0>You know,
the idea for those of what was happening is very,
very similar.
You know,</v>

524
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:45.480
you guys are patrolling out to a location just like you talked about setting up

525
00:30:45.481 --> 00:30:47.100
for remain over day or for the night.

526
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

527
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.410
<v 0>How did you feel like,
you know,
you kind of talked about it,</v>

528
00:30:52.411 --> 00:30:55.920
but did you feel like you were ready for that stuff and

529
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.040
you know,
a lot of times like you said,
we,
we were,
we were,

530
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.690
we trained to drive a lot and we ended up walking so much cause the IED threat,

531
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:11.950
how did you,
how did you manage that once you got on the ground?
Well,
I think,

532
00:31:11.951 --> 00:31:14.170
thank God we had actually trained and,
and you know,

533
00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:16.870
it's been a part of the seal teams is Vietnam,
you know,

534
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:19.750
going out in the southern California desert and training and you know,

535
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.230
land warfare,
you know,

536
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.000
is that that awesome block where you go out and learn how to patrol,
uh,

537
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.900
which we've talked or you know,

538
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:29.050
you talked a lot about the podcast and certainly we talk about with echelon

539
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:29.471
front and you know,

540
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:33.190
where it's man camp out in the southern California desert and this rugged

541
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.890
environment would just sharp rocks and,

542
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.550
and Yak this spines and rattlesnakes.
So,

543
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.390
so real quick,
everybody in the world,

544
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:48.280
when they hear the term southern California,
they think of Bay Watch,
right?

545
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.730
They think of Baywatch.
We talking about Baywatch.

546
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:56.170
So when you go east from the coast in southern California,

547
00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:01.150
you enter a place places that have names like death valley,

548
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.730
right?
Those are the kinds of areas we're talking about.
We're not talking about,

549
00:32:03.731 --> 00:32:05.770
so cow Baywatch,

550
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.400
we're talking about inland in the,

551
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:14.380
in the deserts,
the hard deserts of California.

552
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:18.820
And that's where it's one of the primary places where we trained for combat.

553
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:19.773
And it is,

554
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.870
I always used to say that our desert training facility is where men become frog

555
00:32:23.871 --> 00:32:24.704
men,

556
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.540
even though there's no water out because we're men become frogman cause it will

557
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:31.510
test you no doubt.
And I,
you know,
thank God that we,

558
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:35.410
we get tested like that and that puts,
you know,
the,
that kind of training,
um,

559
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.240
is a,
is something that's kept seals a lab on the battlefield and enabled us to,

560
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.103
to accomplish them.

561
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.520
<v 2>Some great things for a long time.
And I remember that first shakeout patrol,</v>

562
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.600
it was a good one.
The land warfare instructors,

563
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.970
yet we're fired up and get out in the desert to train,
get our land warfare on,

564
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.670
dial it in,
uh,

565
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.740
our procedures and learn how to work together as a team and patrol and we show

566
00:32:56.961 --> 00:32:58.430
up to the camp.

567
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.620
It was funny because generally,
I mean,

568
00:33:03.621 --> 00:33:08.621
I'm not going to say that you have this immense trust with the cadre,

569
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.370
but like,
you know,
we're kind of friends with these guys.
We know him.

570
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:16.100
And so they did a really good job of,

571
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.240
of suckering us in on that,
on that first patrol,
because they said,
hey,

572
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.090
we're just gonna send you guys,
have a little shake out patrol tonight.

573
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:28.490
And so a shakeout patrol in the seal teams means you're gonna put your gear on,

574
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.640
you want to see how everything rides on your body.

575
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.440
You want to make sure that it's comfortable.

576
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:37.280
You want us to make sure that there's no tags that are wearing on you or

577
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:40.070
anything like that.
That's just a shakeup to go get your little hand signals,

578
00:33:40.071 --> 00:33:42.320
make sure we're all good to go get to know each other a little bit.

579
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.950
It's just like a little,
it's basically like a little walk,
like,

580
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.560
like a little walk.
I mean,
they think it's probably going to take a shake out.

581
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:51.260
Patrol should probably take hour,
maybe two hours at the most.

582
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:54.200
We're just going to be,
you know,
kind of relaxed mode,

583
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:58.010
doing a little shake patrol.
And that was the setup.
And is it administrative?

584
00:33:58.011 --> 00:34:00.350
Right?
So you're like,
hey,
let's work on this.
It's that.
So it's,

585
00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:01.220
it's not like you're,

586
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.300
you're in the game acting like you're in enemy territory the whole time and
it's,

587
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.020
you know,
so you're kind of talking with instructors and figuring things out.
So,

588
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:13.250
yeah.
So they're like,
oh yeah,
just the land warfare cadre or like,
yeah,
just,

589
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:16.010
just to shake out patrol.
No big deal.
So we're just showing up,
you know,

590
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:19.680
no one's got there.
I know I didn't have my gear stitch.
I,

591
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.060
I grabbed some stuff that I'd had from advanced training,
uh,

592
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.280
what we call SQT seal qualification training from,

593
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.000
from like two years before that.
Um,
and,
uh,

594
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.230
I had these two canteens that had been filled with water,
um,

595
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.300
in that gear.
And I don't think I had empty that water in like two years.

596
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.620
So there's probably a little algae growth and some nastiness going on in these

597
00:34:42.621 --> 00:34:45.280
kids,
deans.
So I just like,
don't uncle Oh,
shake out patrol,
you know,
it.

598
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.270
And then we were rushed because they were,
they were,
they were like,
hey,

599
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:49.910
we gotta get this going.
We gotta get this going.
So we,
we arrive,
you know,

600
00:34:49.911 --> 00:34:52.790
guys are trying to get settled.
They're like,
Hey,
get out,
know,
get your gear on.

601
00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:57.320
Let's get over there.
It's so,
so we throw our gear on and I throw on that gear,

602
00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.670
those canteens and this two year old water in it and we're a,

603
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:07.050
and we're,
we go,
we'd take off on the patrol.
And what we didn't know was that,

604
00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:11.650
uh,
this shake out patrol was a,
was a,
was a man test.

605
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.580
It was a man test and what a,

606
00:35:13.581 --> 00:35:16.040
where are we like to use the seal teams called the mud suck,

607
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.760
which is basically a sucker punch,
right?
They,
they put together in patrol.

608
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:24.040
That was,
it took hours and hours,
took the whole night,
the whole,

609
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:29.060
the whole cycle of darkness the whole night.
And no one had several guys,

610
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:32.030
didn't have any water.
I remember,
I remember Ryan.

611
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:36.710
Joe had like no water at all.
And I remember him like,
you know,

612
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.010
just was like,
hey,

613
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.430
<v 0>hey,
uh sir,
do you have,
do you have some water?</v>

614
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.730
It actually came up the,
I came up to you I think,
right?

615
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.680
Because it's like you said,
no one had water.
And actually I had water.

616
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.790
I had water,
I was going on.
To me it was like shake out patrol.
Of course,

617
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.590
even though I was like,
oh,
it's kind of administrative.

618
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.480
Of course in my mind I'm like,
hey,
it's a shake on patrol,

619
00:35:57.481 --> 00:36:00.360
but I'm doing everything the way I would do it normally because I'm super

620
00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.360
hardcore.
So I got all my stuff the way it's supposed to.

621
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.590
And also I had the advantage of having done a lot of these trips in my time.

622
00:36:07.591 --> 00:36:10.510
So for me,
I didn't,
it wasn't trying anything new.
It wasn't a shakeup.

623
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.940
Patrol from me was just a patrol.
But yeah,
I went and got good water,
my canteens,

624
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:17.820
my camel back,
and I was all good to go and I was ready for this.

625
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.480
And because discipline equals freedom,
you were,
uh,

626
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.910
you had the freedom to go out and execute with your water.
Meanwhile,

627
00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:26.150
I'm carrying these canteens that I know of,
like I can do,

628
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.210
say she like your first sip,
you spit it out.
I actually,
I actually,

629
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.770
I got so thirsty,
right,
that finally I was like,
I gotta I gotta drink something.

630
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:39.780
And,
uh,
so I,
I,
I pull one of these canteens out again,
you know,

631
00:36:39.781 --> 00:36:43.320
it's just nasty.
I open it up.
I like smell.
It was like made,

632
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:47.410
it smells like it smells like a fish aquarium.
And I like just,
I,

633
00:36:47.411 --> 00:36:50.490
but I'm at this point,
I'm desperate.
I'm desperate like two or three,

634
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:52.980
four hours into this thing,
everyone sweat.
So I was like,

635
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.300
I take a big sip of this thing and it just immediately projectile vomit data,
uh,

636
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.310
that stuff back up.
Um,
and uh,
I,
I,

637
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:06.870
I think I gave one of those campaigns to,
to,
to write,
cause he's so desperate.

638
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.440
But I asked you for water,
how'd that work?
Can I ask you for what?
I was like,

639
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:15.330
Hey Jocko,
do you have any water?
And I was like,
yes.
That was like,

640
00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:19.020
yes,
I do.
And you said,
kick guy,
can you,
he's,
your voice was scratchy,

641
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:20.850
but do the whole nine yards you?
Or did you like,

642
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.820
can you give some of that to Ryan?
He didn't bring any water.

643
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.810
And I said something along the lines of,
well,
first thing I said,
no,

644
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.460
you can't have any of my water.
If,
if you want water,
you must hump it in.

645
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.540
You don't,
I don't Hump in your water and I'm not humping in Ryan's water.

646
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.540
That doesn't work.
That's why you bring in your own water.

647
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:44.730
And then as I think I said,
like if he's going to die,
I will give you some water.

648
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.670
If he's not going to die,
you will get nothing.

649
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.830
And he got nothing and it just so everybody understands like it is.
It is pretty.

650
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.640
If you can't carry your own stuff in,
right,
it's,

651
00:37:56.641 --> 00:38:01.620
it's pretty taboo to have to have to lick,
depend on somebody else.
No kidding.

652
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:04.050
At that point we didn't actually know,

653
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.970
I didn't know how long we were going to be in the field for.
I mean we,

654
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.070
they were keeping in the dark wood.

655
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.330
They didn't tell people and they did a really good job of,

656
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.220
they brought us into the hill,

657
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:18.330
into the hills of southern California where you're going to be going up and down

658
00:38:18.331 --> 00:38:21.690
terrain and the terrain is uneven.
And they did this whole link up drill.

659
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:23.850
So it wasn't like we were just blindly walking.

660
00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:27.750
It was link up from starting with swim pairs and then fire team link up and then

661
00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:31.890
squad link up and then platoon link up and yeah,
so we,
the,

662
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:36.160
the future was very unknown at this time.
It's all,
I,
I wasn't,
you know,
thinking,

663
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.170
<v 2>Hey,
I'll just give a bunch of my water away because yeah,</v>

664
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.380
you give all your water,
you've got nothing,

665
00:38:41.381 --> 00:38:43.930
and then you're struggling to keep up too.
So it's,
it's,

666
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.850
it was a bad situation and it was an Sasol.

667
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.980
I think I might just have like peaked a little bit at least getting in the zone

668
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.370
a little bit.
Definitely borderline.
But look,
I think the reality was,
uh,

669
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.620
you were helping reinforce the lesson that you gotta have your gear squared
away.

670
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.520
You gotta be right and you gotta be ready for contingency like that because that

671
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:06.130
happened all the time to us.
You know,
where we like,
hey,
this is going to be,

672
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.200
you know,
obviously we're in Ramadi and were like,
hey,

673
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:12.010
this will be a 24 hour operation.
Like,
no,
now it's a 48 hour operation.

674
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.980
Now it turns into a 72 hour operation.
We're going to,

675
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.810
we're going to stay here longer than we thought.

676
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.110
So you gotta have you gotta be squared away.

677
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.440
You gotta be thinking about that and you know,
thank God we had a such awesome,

678
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.230
amazing leaders like,
like Tonia,
fratty,
you know,

679
00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:29.800
there's just been on this podcast and that people love and which is why we can

680
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:34.090
say his name because otherwise we'd name off all the other guys that were out

681
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:37.720
there.
Good.
You know,
the Lpo pose that getting after it,

682
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.140
the e five mafia in there running things.
So yeah,
it's a,

683
00:39:41.141 --> 00:39:44.710
it's the whole crew and that was exactly and just leaders at every level that

684
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:47.660
we're stepping up,
leading their fire teams,
leading their squad.
Uh,

685
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.140
and I think that was it.
Thank God I appreciate it as,

686
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:53.020
as much as that sucked.

687
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.110
And as much as people were complaining about that at the time,
um,

688
00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.220
those kinds of training scenarios where we didn't see it coming and it was a lot

689
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:04.280
harder than we thought it was going to be.
It got us ready,
you know,
to,
to,
uh,

690
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.450
for those,
those long rates,
patrols and Ramadi.
And when we got there,

691
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:10.180
like you said,
we thought we all thought we're going to drive.
And they were like,

692
00:40:10.181 --> 00:40:11.490
well,
we can't drive man.

693
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.960
That's the best way to get killed if you don't try to drive into some of these

694
00:40:13.961 --> 00:40:18.840
areas.
So Park your vehicles and walk in on foot.
Uh,

695
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.820
and again,
we know we learn,
we only had to carry the essential stuff,

696
00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:23.860
but we also knew we had to carry some fire power to,

697
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:27.820
cause one of the things that we did in Ramadi was,
you know,

698
00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:30.940
I think oftentimes special operators can get a little spoiled where,
you know,

699
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:34.210
if you're going out on a mission and it's got some higher profile and you've
got,

700
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.330
you know,
you've got aircraft supporting you and,
and you know,

701
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:40.840
you're going to have all this,
uh,
you've got close air support set up where it's,

702
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:44.950
it's just dedicated to you,
you know.
And here we are,
we're,
we're,
you know,
we,

703
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:48.790
we had 40 seals and tasking at bruiser,
so I'm leading them 16 man seal platoon.

704
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:52.310
And maybe a couple of other augments,
um,
you know,
with seals and,

705
00:40:52.311 --> 00:40:54.880
and our EOD bomb disposal technicians and Iraqi soldiers.

706
00:40:55.690 --> 00:41:00.550
And we're just one tiny unit out of 5,600 troops,
marines and soldiers,

707
00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:04.790
the First Brigade,
First Armored Division,
Brigade Combat Team.
So,
um,

708
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.570
there isn't dedicated aircraft to us.
You know,

709
00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:11.800
there isn't a QRF that's a quick reaction force that's dedicated just to us to

710
00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:13.930
come out.
Yeah.
Because on top of it,
you know,

711
00:41:13.931 --> 00:41:18.931
we had our unit and just because you were out with your platoon in a firefight,

712
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.770
you were not the only game in town at that time.

713
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.950
There would be three or four other units somewhere else on the battlefield that

714
00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:30.400
were in a firefight may be worse,
maybe not as bad,
but there was,

715
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:35.180
there was always someone that's calling the QRF or that needs air support.

716
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.350
So it was exactly like you're saying,
we,

717
00:41:37.351 --> 00:41:41.000
we weren't at the top of some food chain.
We were just in the,

718
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:45.110
in the food chain and had to learn how to mitigate that stuff by,
so,

719
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:49.370
so you know,
that massive load out that you took and you were heavy.
You,

720
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.830
it's not like you said,
okay,
I'm not going to have to carry this stuff anymore.

721
00:41:51.831 --> 00:41:55.310
You still had to to bring it w we had to make sure that,
uh,

722
00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:59.360
that we carried our own firepower into those areas when in an era where we knew

723
00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:02.270
that the tanks may have a hard time getting in there to us,
even if,

724
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.170
even if in the the emergency scenario,
and we didn't want to be overrun,
you know,

725
00:42:06.171 --> 00:42:09.590
50 enemy fire trying to overrun our position.
And we only had,
you know,

726
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:10.730
eight or 10 or 12,

727
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.900
12 guys in this position with some Iraqi soldiers who were pretty much worthless

728
00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:19.850
when it came to,
uh,
to beating back and enemy attack.
Uh,
like that.
So,
um,

729
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.440
and then,
and by the way,
there were many positions,

730
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:29.260
small positions,
some sniper size elements that were overrun.
And despite,

731
00:42:29.261 --> 00:42:30.410
I know before we showed up,

732
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:32.910
there was an element that disappeared and they didn't,

733
00:42:32.911 --> 00:42:36.170
they found their bodies months later.
But you know,
same thing,

734
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:37.910
it was a smaller element of,
I don't know,

735
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:41.540
it was five or six guys in a sniper type element.
They got overrun.

736
00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:43.620
They didn't know.
No one knew what happened to them and it,

737
00:42:43.621 --> 00:42:47.120
how it happened to large fortified positions as well.

738
00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:50.690
If you remember some of the checkpoints that were well fortified and built up

739
00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:55.640
and they got completely overrun by,
by,
by Moosh.
And so,

740
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:56.030
yes,

741
00:42:56.030 --> 00:43:01.030
my driving a big thousand pound Vbi d truck bombing and their position horrible.

742
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.920
We had to carry all kinds of that,
that fire power with us.

743
00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:07.100
We had to carry on our backs.
So the belt fed machine goes,
guys carrying those,

744
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.520
those,
uh,
the machine gets it.
We're going to beat back enemy attacks.
Um,

745
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.070
Carl Gustaf was,
was,
uh,

746
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.240
our shoulder fire writes a recoilless 84 millimeter recoilless rifle that we use

747
00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:22.490
and it's heavy,
super heavy.
Um,
it's great against enemy tanks.

748
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.480
Uh,
the [inaudible] didn't have any tags,
so,
um,

749
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.240
it was probably a lot heavier than what we needed.
Uh,
our,
uh,

750
00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:35.120
our leading petty officer would just man up BTF and carry that thing in.

751
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.050
Um,

752
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:38.720
and he figured out pretty quick though that I think the first time he tried to

753
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:42.620
carry it in and he's,
uh,
he,
they were on a long range foot patrol and,

754
00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:46.910
and going into an area that was,
this was a ruler a little bit outside the city.

755
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.670
And so now,
you know,

756
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:52.490
we were used to patrol on the city streets in this rural area,

757
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.190
a Mc one that was kind of out east of,
of Ramadi.

758
00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.020
Now you're talking about petroleum through farm fields and flooded,

759
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.470
flooded areas where you might be an ankle or knee deep mud.

760
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.050
It looked like Vietnam.
It looked like every,

761
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:09.140
every war movie that you see about Vietnam.
In fact,

762
00:44:09.141 --> 00:44:13.880
we used to call it Vva Rom via Ram.
That's what we really call it.
And it was,

763
00:44:13.881 --> 00:44:14.970
it was,
it was just like that.
I mean,

764
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:19.880
my first patrol that went on out there were literally waiting through irrigated

765
00:44:19.881 --> 00:44:21.520
fields through mud.
And,
and,

766
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.770
and waiting through canals cause there's all these little canals are coming off

767
00:44:24.771 --> 00:44:26.910
the river to irrigate the fields.
And,

768
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:29.060
and there were some marines support and us that we had,

769
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:34.190
we had a Huey helicopter and a Cobra gunship which are Vietnam error platforms.

770
00:44:34.191 --> 00:44:37.890
Yes.
And I was like,
man am I am in Iraq right now,
our Vietnam,
this is great.

771
00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:42.240
There was,
there were people out tilling the fields with like a,
like an ox.

772
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.470
I mean it looked like something straight out of it was actually crazy out there.

773
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:50.370
And if you want how much it looked like Vietnam,
it was nuts.
It was nuts.

774
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.950
And it was not anything that we'd expect expected to do,
certainly.

775
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.550
So we just had to prepare for that contingency and,
and uh,

776
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.460
and figure out a way to,
you know,
to operate in that environment.
Um,
and,
but,

777
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.830
but you know,
our Lpo is carrying that,
you know,

778
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.660
carrying that big man a rocket.
Uh,
but he recognized right away.
Like,

779
00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:09.630
initially he tried to carry some rounds in his backpack and you know,

780
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.120
each of them,
I don't even know what this thing weighs,
but it's,

781
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.940
it's gotta be what it's gotta be.

782
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.560
I think the weapon itself probably weighs 25,
25 pounds and each of the rounds,

783
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:24.240
because you got to wait.
Towns are heavy willpower pounds.
Yeah.
Maybe 15 pounds.

784
00:45:24.241 --> 00:45:28.830
I don't know.
But so when you put that thing,
when you load that thing,
uh,

785
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.460
initially carried in loaded and they'd put around his backpack and it just

786
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:36.090
weighted down.
He couldn't do it.
So,
uh,
you know,
it was a hard,
hard keeping up.

787
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:38.430
So recognize I'm going to carry it empty.
I'll carry it in my hand.

788
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:42.300
I'll put one round in my backpack that I can use and then we'll put a another.

789
00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:46.020
I always carried around for it in my,
in my rucksack as well,
you know,

790
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:47.820
that I could hand off to those gunners if they needed it.

791
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.730
But that gave us some firepower to be able to,

792
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:53.460
to beat back in any of the attack and we had to carry that stuff in on herself.

793
00:45:53.461 --> 00:45:56.700
So it just,
it's uh,
you know,
one or two guys that can man up and do that.

794
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.910
And our LPO was,
was the guy to BTF with that.
Yeah.

795
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:03.270
And you said if you need it and you needed a lot because,
um,
you know,

796
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.170
I don't know if you remember this,

797
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:09.171
but you guys shot the six month load out of Carl Gustaf rounds in about a week

798
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.053
and a half.
So,

799
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.440
and then we had to borrow a bunch from the rangers and we actually shot their

800
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:15.810
load out too.
So it was awesome.

801
00:46:15.811 --> 00:46:19.170
We actually got the cool Air Bert first round from the ranch,
which was awesome.

802
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.160
Yeah,
those are,
those were effective.
What does that mean here?

803
00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:27.670
Burst Airburst means that,
uh,
it explodes over the top of,
so that gets,

804
00:46:27.671 --> 00:46:29.740
are shooting at you from a rooftop,
right?
Like,
and,

805
00:46:29.741 --> 00:46:33.930
and they're hiding behind a wall.
Um,
you could like,
you could,
you can,

806
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.250
you can determine like how far they are and set a timer on there so it explodes

807
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.760
over the top of that.
Oh yeah.
So it's pretty devastating.
It's pretty awesome.

808
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.860
We like devastating.
Yeah.
D Two bridges or got after it with some Karl g routes.

809
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.240
Yeah,
this kind of advanced though,

810
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.470
you know like technology wise where you can set how far you want it to.

811
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.490
It is advanced and throws,

812
00:46:53.491 --> 00:46:55.960
throws another kind of twist and do you know you've got to be,
yeah,

813
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.610
it's good to go.
I didn't know.
I didn't know it was like that.
Well,

814
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:02.340
they actually had an airburst rounds for a really long time.

815
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.920
We don't hear about them though.
You know what I mean?

816
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.740
I know it's a little advanced in the civilian sector I guess.
Man,

817
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.730
it's pretty dope though.
That's good stuff.
All right.
Hey,

818
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:12.960
I'm going to go back to the book here.

819
00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.050
Taking turns.

820
00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:22.110
They carried the big PRC 77 scrambler radio and interestingly if you remember

821
00:47:23.081 --> 00:47:26.080
when Andy Stumpf was just on and we were talking about being new guys in the

822
00:47:26.081 --> 00:47:30.670
seal teams in the 90s we were still carrying PRC 77

823
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.390
<v 0>in our trading operations,
which is pretty crazy.
We carried it buds.</v>

824
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.740
We did did it for our comp shots and bud taking turns.

825
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:41.860
They carried the big PRC 77 scrambler radio,

826
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:44.020
which weighed 30 pounds with its battery.

827
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.930
They shared the weight of memory.

828
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.160
They took up what others could no longer bear.

829
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:56.080
Often they carried each other the wounded or weak.

830
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.870
They carried infections.
They carried chess sets,
basketballs,
Vietnamese,

831
00:48:01.871 --> 00:48:06.430
English dictionaries in Sydney is a frank bronze stars and Purple Hearts,

832
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.460
plastic cards and printed with the code of conduct.

833
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:15.130
They carry diseases among them,
malaria and dysentery.

834
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.970
They carry lice and ringworm and leeches that patty algae and various rots and

835
00:48:22.331 --> 00:48:23.164
molds.

836
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:29.590
They carried the land itself.
Vietnam,
the place,

837
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:33.670
the soil,
a powdery orange,

838
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:38.730
red dust that covered their boots and fatigues and faces.

839
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.860
They carried the sky,
the whole atmosphere.

840
00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.040
They carried it,
the humidity,
the monsoons,

841
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:51.340
the stink of fungus and decay.
All of it.

842
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.190
They carried gravity.

843
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:58.243
<v 1>Okay,</v>

844
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.840
<v 0>what a great description coming.
That's just,
and that's why like I said,</v>

845
00:49:03.841 --> 00:49:05.320
even though this book is,
you know,

846
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:08.640
part fiction in in a blend of truth and fiction,

847
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:13.670
that clearly is written by someone that was on the ground in Vietnam and there's

848
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.820
a lot of similarities between that.

849
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

850
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:22.520
<v 0>Environment and the land itself and the atmosphere.</v>

851
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:23.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

852
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:24.803
<v 0>In Ramadi,</v>

853
00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:28.620
what do you think of when you think of the atmosphere and the land or in Ramadi?

854
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:32.280
Just listen to that again.
It just takes me right,
right back there.
Uh,
you know,

855
00:49:32.281 --> 00:49:35.700
to,
oh.
So no one could have been able to write that unless they'd been there,

856
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:39.030
you know,
unless they've been a part of that.
Um,
and uh,

857
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.640
you know what that was like.
Yeah.
For us.

858
00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.270
And the first thing I remember about about being rod is just the,

859
00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.730
the stitch,
you know,
it was,
there's something,

860
00:49:47.731 --> 00:49:49.890
there was always the stench of something burning,

861
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.450
always the something burning and whether it was civilians burning trash because

862
00:49:54.451 --> 00:49:58.590
there's no trash pickup and this total war zone city and you see this giant

863
00:49:58.591 --> 00:49:59.880
trash piles everywhere.

864
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.980
And so certainly there was a stitch of that garbage all the time.
Um,
and uh,

865
00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:08.850
but so they'd be burning trash and a lot of the burning was a burning vehicle in

866
00:50:08.851 --> 00:50:13.110
the street that got id.
You know,
that was an explosion that went off.
That was,

867
00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:17.190
that was a building that was on fire because the tax hit it with a main gun

868
00:50:17.191 --> 00:50:20.490
round.
Um,
and uh,
you know,
or,
or,

869
00:50:20.491 --> 00:50:25.110
or the bad guys at driven of truck bomb into position and just just smoke in the

870
00:50:25.111 --> 00:50:26.370
air.
And uh,

871
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.470
I remember that that statute burning and I remember the stench of the trash,

872
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.400
the garbage,
uh,
and,
and sewage,
raw sewage,
that was always a,

873
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:37.120
a statue as well.
And uh,

874
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:40.820
I kind of takes me back there and the kind of haze in the air that you get,

875
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.520
that kind of Iraqi haze,
it's kind of like a,
the,

876
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:45.170
all those smells that you talk about,

877
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.630
it's kind of like war is hanging in the air cause it's fire and it's gunpowder

878
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:52.480
and it's trash and it's a,

879
00:50:52.481 --> 00:50:56.630
it's like that smell is war in my mind.

880
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.850
If I smelled that smell,
I think we were at war right now

881
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.670
that sometimes if,
uh,
uh,
you know,

882
00:51:03.671 --> 00:51:05.680
sometimes you'll smell a similar smell or things like that.

883
00:51:05.681 --> 00:51:10.150
It was just kind of take me right back to,
to,
to be in that environment.
Um,
yeah,

884
00:51:10.151 --> 00:51:12.730
those,
the,
the statute I think is,
is a of that.
But it was,

885
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:17.200
it was also a stench that we loved as well.
Cause you know,

886
00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.630
this is what we dreamed about our whole life.

887
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:24.280
And I remember Tony and I talking about that,
you know,
just,
just,
um,

888
00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:28.090
this is where we want it to be.
Right.
I mean,
every people in t bruiser are,

889
00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:32.440
our boys were ready to get after it and be a part of that.
And,
and uh,

890
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:33.250
you know,

891
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:37.390
where else would we want to want to be that in that it incredibly difficult

892
00:51:37.391 --> 00:51:41.990
environment.
You know,
this most dangerous battlefield.
And uh,
we,

893
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:45.610
we wanted to be a part of that.
So is that,
it was,
it stopped,
but it was,
it was,

894
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:49.210
it was a good,
I remember the first stage,
first big operation,

895
00:51:49.211 --> 00:51:53.500
we did an [inaudible] and I'm rolling in there and it's,
it's dark.

896
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.260
And we kind of turned miss bane corner.

897
00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.440
And as soon as we turned this main corner of theirs,

898
00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:03.040
there's tires in the street on fire.
And
you know,

899
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:06.170
so you,
I could smell it before,
but I was like,
what does that,
what am I smelling?

900
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:07.004
Burning Tires,
Bruce.

901
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:09.830
Sure enough we turned the corner and it screws up your night vision goggles

902
00:52:09.831 --> 00:52:12.980
because now they're getting all blight out by the bright light.
And,

903
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.980
and then as the sun's coming up a little bit,
you see the dark smoke.

904
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:20.420
And I remember that to me.
I don't know why,

905
00:52:20.421 --> 00:52:25.040
but that to me was the switch in my mind that cause cause there's,

906
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:28.160
that was the first cause of my first big operation.

907
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:32.190
That was the first thing that I said to myself.
Go though,

908
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:36.640
those are the bad guys though.
The bad guys did that.
They're here.
They're,

909
00:52:36.641 --> 00:52:39.650
they were just there.
You know,
it was like my first moment of saying that.

910
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:43.370
And it's also very distracting and hard to see and all that other stuff.

911
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:47.690
And I remember when I was running training and we would do mount scenarios,

912
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.210
my,
one of my big things,
you know,
I say all right guys,

913
00:52:50.211 --> 00:52:51.380
how many tires going to put out to burn?

914
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.030
And I remember one time someone was like,
you know,

915
00:52:53.031 --> 00:52:56.450
we're not going to do the tires tonight.
And I said,
no,

916
00:52:56.451 --> 00:52:59.570
we're doing the tires tonight.
Always set tires on fire,

917
00:52:59.571 --> 00:53:03.110
let that be known because it screws things up.

918
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:08.440
And I think it was just my own personal desire to be taken back to that place.

919
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:11.990
Like you were just talking about.

920
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.390
Well I remember those mouth scenarios going out there with you.

921
00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:15.980
You know you run in that trading when I was at,

922
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.580
you know when I was at op operations officer and executive officer at a seal

923
00:53:19.581 --> 00:53:23.750
team and it took me right back there and to me the smell that,
you know,
the,

924
00:53:23.751 --> 00:53:26.130
the statute would hear the,
the call to prayer,

925
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.360
<v 2>you know,
comes out and you'd see the graffitied walls and it was,</v>

926
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.930
it was so much like that and it was awesome.
It was awesome.

927
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:35.820
He has night vision on our,
in our,

928
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.780
when we really got after it with the Mount Training facility and really did

929
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:42.960
everything we could to simulate what the guys were going to experience.
Man,

930
00:53:42.961 --> 00:53:45.540
you couldn't,
you couldn't tell.
Actually you could you,
if you,

931
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:48.030
if you got transplanted you wouldn't go.
Cause we did the,

932
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:53.190
even the cause in Ramadi,
all the,
the electrical wires were all knocked down.

933
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:57.600
So we'd string these crazy wires up just randomly in art in the streets to make

934
00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:00.060
it look cause cause guess what you'd be running and to get caught up in this

935
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:03.060
wire and you've got to make sure it's not an Iud so you can't just pull it,

936
00:54:03.061 --> 00:54:07.200
you know,
it's all these little things to simulate as best you can.

937
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:11.460
But thank God he didn't have the rivers of raw sewage running through the

938
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:15.420
streets.
Sometimes I want to,
our guys would slip and fall down into,

939
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.180
which was just horrible.
I had one of my first appointment,

940
00:54:18.181 --> 00:54:21.420
this guy was walking and I don't know what this was,
but

941
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.640
we were just walking in.
All of a sudden he walked and he fell through.

942
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:27.241
I was like,

943
00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:32.241
there was a hardened shell and he fell through this hardened shell right into a

944
00:54:32.251 --> 00:54:35.430
sewage pit and
cause all the,

945
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.490
I don't know what the shell was made of,
but it was,

946
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:43.560
we know what was under it and it was nasty.
It was a big metal pipe across,

947
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.680
uh,
across you've ever,

948
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.990
we called it Shit Creek that was actually the official name on the map because

949
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:52.800
it was literally like a creek of raw sewage and there's a big metal pipe and we

950
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:55.340
often patrolled across this pipe.
Um,
you know,

951
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:57.450
it was the one where you didn't have to jump it,

952
00:54:57.451 --> 00:55:01.830
you could actually just walk across.
Um,
and later actually some of the army,

953
00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:05.640
I said burn the grass out there.
And there was,
there were ideas all around it.

954
00:55:05.641 --> 00:55:08.100
We ain't even know were there when we first patrolled in.
Uh,

955
00:55:08.101 --> 00:55:09.690
but when one guy was with us,

956
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:15.230
he slipped off the pipe and the fill into the fill into a shit creek,

957
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.120
which,
and now you know,
he's,
he's gotta be in that uniform for the next four.

958
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.140
It's only a 48 hour operation,
no shower,

959
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.890
no shower for a good 24 48 hours.
That's good jobs right there.

960
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:30.840
I think the one thing missing two from,
you know,
from,
uh,

961
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:34.320
that we couldn't recreate in that,
in that mountain area that you were running.

962
00:55:34.321 --> 00:55:37.170
It was,
it was so awesome,
but the,
just the heat,

963
00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:42.090
the heat was overwhelming.
And I think that's,
that's what really got guys,

964
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.050
even guys that were in really good shape,
who were,
you know,
great athletes.

965
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.510
If you weren't a climatized to that did,
did,

966
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:53.460
it just didn't matter until you really got to climatized.
Um,
it would crush you.

967
00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:56.730
And I remember that going in,
you know,
even like I said,
at nighttime,

968
00:55:56.731 --> 00:56:00.480
it's still like 95 degrees outside and,
and you know,
when the sun's coming up,

969
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:03.510
there'll be a little bit of breeze kind of early morning and you get a little

970
00:56:03.511 --> 00:56:07.590
bit of coolness and we're talking to,
it's like high nineties.
Right?
But you know,

971
00:56:07.591 --> 00:56:10.770
it's going to hit one 17,
you know,
for the high that day.

972
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.810
And you're sitting on the rooftop and,
and my,

973
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:17.730
my rucksack is still covered with tar where you know,
the,

974
00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:17.891
the,

975
00:56:17.891 --> 00:56:22.110
the tar starts creeping out at the rooftop and just melting into your bag and

976
00:56:22.111 --> 00:56:24.400
stick it onto your weapon and your gear

977
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:28.630
<v 0>and your uniforms.
Now I sweat a lot.
Like I,
I'm a sweat.</v>

978
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:30.430
I sweat a lot as a person.
I remember.

979
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:34.480
But I remember one time and it wasn't when we did cop falcon the first time,

980
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.500
but it wasn't when they had air conditioning in there yet.

981
00:56:36.501 --> 00:56:40.300
It was like in one of those inter between ops and I was down there,

982
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:43.280
you guys went out,
you guys were working and I was in their cop falcon and,

983
00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:47.280
and I had come down in a Bradley or in a Humvee,
Bradley's or hobby.

984
00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:52.210
They're both hot but,
but then I got in the building and I was coordinating with,

985
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:53.280
you know,
the,

986
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:57.310
the company commander and I'm sitting there and now I'm not doing,

987
00:56:57.311 --> 00:57:01.090
now I haven't been doing anything physical.
In fact,
I,
I think I was inside with,

988
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:05.590
with my gear off,
just with my body armor on.
But I'm just sitting there and,

989
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.700
and I'm sitting there like looking at a battle map and it's just me.

990
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.260
No one's with me.
I'm just looking at the battle of map.

991
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.490
I think I'm trying to drive talking to you.

992
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:14.290
You're probably heading out in the city and you're going somewhere and I'm

993
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:18.670
looking at where you are and there is a stream of sweat.
I'm not doing anything.

994
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.880
I'm just literally sitting looking at a map and there is a of sweat coming off

995
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:28.510
of my nose onto the,
onto the battle map.
And I thought to myself,
Bro,

996
00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:33.370
it's hot.
It is hot here.
Well and you were in the shade then and no,

997
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:37.570
this was,
this was at night.
Oh you would at nighttime.
Like we came down at night.

998
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:39.220
You guys inserted it and I was just sitting there.

999
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:40.290
So I had been sitting there for it.

1000
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:44.380
And that's one thing that I always know this is the hottest time of day in the

1001
00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:46.900
desert is when the sun goes down.

1002
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.660
I don't know if this is a true physic thing.

1003
00:57:49.661 --> 00:57:52.720
If you're a scientist and you want to come back at me with the facts,

1004
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:56.110
maybe I'm wrong,
but let me tell you what it feels like.
And I,
I say this,

1005
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.870
the heat comes out of the ground,

1006
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.940
so all that has been beaten down the ground all day.

1007
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:06.130
The heat comes out of the ground and then the wind stops.
And so it's just,

1008
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:09.100
that is the hottest time.
It's true here in the southern California desert.

1009
00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:13.300
And it was true when I Iraq that the hottest few hours was after the sun goes

1010
00:58:13.301 --> 00:58:16.180
down,
like the next two to three hours is the worst.

1011
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:20.470
Absolutely brutal on on that,
that same operation.
I remember we were,

1012
00:58:20.471 --> 00:58:22.950
we were running out of water because we know we,
we were out,

1013
00:58:22.951 --> 00:58:24.400
we had moved out 300,

1014
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.180
300 yards or so down the street and set up in that big Ford story apartment

1015
00:58:28.181 --> 00:58:31.960
building.
And uh,
we run out of water,
so we had to do,

1016
00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:34.030
so I remember we're doing a daytime,

1017
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.550
I was like [inaudible] have a couple of guys.
We had a stretcher.

1018
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.100
We have a foldable like Israelis stretcher that we,

1019
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:44.110
we open it up and me and three other guys are sprinting down the street because

1020
00:58:44.111 --> 00:58:46.850
we know there's snipers out here.
I mean,
we're right in the,
you know,

1021
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.770
we're outside the perimeter and we're running back to where you were at the Cop

1022
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.490
Falcon and we loaded up a bunch of case of water and the Maoris and then we're

1023
00:58:54.491 --> 00:58:56.990
sprinting back.
And I remember getting back from that,
you know,

1024
00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:58.150
and that we did that at like,

1025
00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:01.570
it's probably like two o'clock in the afternoon and it's literally like 117

1026
00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:05.310
hundred 20 degrees.
And I was,
of course,
we had our gear on and we do,

1027
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.650
we're doing this 300 yards spread,

1028
00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:09.370
carrying a stretcher that probably weighs like 150 pounds.

1029
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:13.000
We can bring it up with water for like 20 guys.
And it was,
you know,
in food.

1030
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.990
And uh,
it was,
I don't think I,

1031
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:19.110
I mean I look like I just got out of the shower for sure.

1032
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.240
Just sweating all your gear and a lot of our IPO,

1033
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:26.120
<v 2>you know,
there was the requirement you had to wear I pro uh,
eye protection.</v>

1034
00:59:26.121 --> 00:59:26.690
So either like,

1035
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:30.800
like ballistic glasses or a and r guys had been wearing previously was the

1036
00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:33.500
goggles that you wear to protect your eyes.

1037
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:37.280
You couldn't wear it because if you had it on it would be completely fogged up

1038
00:59:37.281 --> 00:59:39.890
and you couldn't see 10 feet in front of you.
And it was like,
okay,

1039
00:59:39.891 --> 00:59:43.810
I can protect my eyes or I can like get shot and killed or trip over something

1040
00:59:43.811 --> 00:59:45.740
and not be able to get where I need to go.
And you yeah,

1041
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:48.260
cause you'd be completely blinded by the,
uh,
by the,

1042
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:53.090
the fog and nothing where we tried to get the high speed ones with like the

1043
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:57.520
little,
what's about high tech?
Here's some high tech,

1044
00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:02.960
we've got these goggles that had little miniature fans in them to blow fresh air

1045
01:00:02.961 --> 01:00:06.860
in there.
They suck it all.
Everything sucks.
Nothing works.

1046
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:12.310
I'm like windshield wipers.
That's what you needed it.
That was another little TB.

1047
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:15.350
Tea Brews bruiser saying everything sucks.
Nothing works.

1048
01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:18.290
Because someone was saying like,
hey man,
hey,
you know this,

1049
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.200
this thing's not working.
We'll get everything socks.
Nothing works.
Deal with it.

1050
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.910
Oh,
everything sucks.
Nothing works.
Next.
We know that it's a given.

1051
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.350
Everything sucks.
Nothing works.

1052
01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:31.970
BTF BTF BTF BTF and actually we talked about the heat,

1053
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:36.500
but you know we didn't talk about is the damn moon dust because you know he's

1054
01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:39.860
talking about there.
They had orange,
red dust,
the moon,

1055
01:00:39.861 --> 01:00:43.850
Dustin Ramadi was nasty and gnarly and it was everywhere.

1056
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.980
I remember specifically Corregidor was completely covered,

1057
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:51.800
which was the,
the camp on the eastern side of Ramadi.

1058
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:55.400
We're the first of the five oh six was there and then we had a detachment of

1059
01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:57.710
seals there and when you'd go over there,

1060
01:00:57.711 --> 01:01:00.980
it was just every step you took,
there was

1061
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:06.260
even trails that were getting walked on all day to the head or or to the Chow

1062
01:01:06.261 --> 01:01:09.280
Hall.
You those trails that were walked on every single day,
every day.

1063
01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:11.840
It didn't matter.
Every time you took a step,

1064
01:01:11.841 --> 01:01:15.950
there's a little cloud burst of this moon dust,
this fine,
fine moon,

1065
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:18.260
dust covered everything.
And it was all over the city too.

1066
01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.660
It was like talcum powder and it,
it,
it was,
you know,
those tanks would come in,

1067
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.960
they crunch up the concrete.
So even if it was,

1068
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.170
even if it hadn't been previously paved,
now you're going to,
you got,

1069
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.760
you got sand,
you know,
dirt and,
and uh,
and it just,

1070
01:01:31.761 --> 01:01:34.430
I remember it getting an everything.
So we park our vehicles.

1071
01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:36.800
I remember particularly to combat books,
grant,
you know,

1072
01:01:36.801 --> 01:01:40.040
right in the heart of just south central [inaudible].
Um,

1073
01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:43.340
and it was patrolling out of there.
You were in like knee deep moon does.

1074
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:47.480
So you know now and at one patrolling out into a sniper Overwatch position

1075
01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:50.390
moving at nighttime.
And not only is it dusty and getting all over stuff,

1076
01:01:50.391 --> 01:01:53.600
it gets into your weapons and,
and you know,
you have to constantly clean them.

1077
01:01:53.601 --> 01:01:57.770
And,
and,
uh,
but I remember we get to where we were going,
you know,

1078
01:01:57.771 --> 01:02:01.520
get an Overwatch position and you don't often have to take your boots off and

1079
01:02:01.521 --> 01:02:06.521
just dump out like a pound of sand of that moon dust that had gotten inside your

1080
01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:10.370
boots.
Got in through the little holes in your little Johnny's,

1081
01:02:10.371 --> 01:02:12.840
any holes on your jungle.
It was,
what is Moondust just,

1082
01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:17.090
it's a death that happened.
It's this fine,
fine,
fine.

1083
01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.250
It's like Lafe said,
it's like talcum,
but it's dirt.

1084
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.950
<v 0>It's some kind of fine,
fine sand again.</v>

1085
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:25.620
I'm sure there's some scientists that's going to say that what it specifically

1086
01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:29.450
is,
but as far as I'm concerned,
it's moon dust.
That's where it came from.
This is,

1087
01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:33.500
we're not talking about like on the beach in Hawaii,
right?
We're talking.

1088
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:36.720
This is like if you,
you walked through this stuff,
it's all over you.

1089
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:37.650
It gets everywhere.

1090
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:41.640
There's literally walking through it and there's like a cloud of dust coming

1091
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.010
behind you so far.

1092
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:46.740
You would drive by when it vehicle would drive by your same thing.

1093
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.140
It'd be she's a good GI UBS walking.

1094
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:51.500
You're just breathing this moon Dustin in and it's,

1095
01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:54.300
it's you blow your nose and it's just like Brown.

1096
01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.490
It's the color of the moon dust where like when you

1097
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.040
dirt bikes or something in it,
more of a dry area.

1098
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.460
I mean obviously I'm sure it's way worse than you know when Ramadi,

1099
01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:09.090
but same thing,
when you breathe,
you're breathing in,

1100
01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:12.780
your profit's going to come out below your nose.
It's just that,

1101
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:16.140
that's just how it is over there.
Dust everywhere.

1102
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.490
I'm taking this back to the book.

1103
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:25.920
They moved like murals by daylight.

1104
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:30.810
They took sniper fire at night.
They were mortared,
but it was not battle.

1105
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:35.400
It was just the endless March village to village without purpose.

1106
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.890
Nothing won or lost.

1107
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:42.360
They marched for the sake of the march.

1108
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.860
They plotted along slowly dumb Lee leaning forward against the heat.

1109
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.590
Unthinking,
all blood and bone.

1110
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.070
Simple grunts soldiering with their legs,

1111
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.930
toiling up the hills and down into the patties and to cross the rivers and up

1112
01:03:57.931 --> 01:03:59.460
and down again,

1113
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.200
just humping one step and then the next and then another,

1114
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.550
but no volition,
no will because it was automatic.

1115
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:10.410
It was anatomy.

1116
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:15.330
And the war was entirely a matter of posture and carriage.

1117
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:19.650
The Hump was everything,
a kind of inertia,
a kind of emptiness,

1118
01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:24.780
Udonis of desire and intellect and conscious and hope and human sensibility.

1119
01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.900
Their principals were in their feet,

1120
01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:37.220
their calculations were biological.
They had no sense of strategy or mission.

1121
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.270
They searched the villages without knowing what to look for,
not carrying,

1122
01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:43.580
kicking over jars of rice,

1123
01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:47.210
frisking children and old men blowing tunnels,
sometimes settings,

1124
01:04:47.211 --> 01:04:48.800
fires and sometimes not.

1125
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:53.150
Then forming up and moving on to the next village than other villages where it

1126
01:04:53.151 --> 01:04:54.530
would always be the same.

1127
01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:01.590
They carried their own lives.
The pressures were in Norman.

1128
01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.533
<v 1>Yes.</v>

1129
01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:08.600
<v 0>In the heat of early afternoon,
they would remove their helmets and flak jackets,</v>

1130
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.270
walking bear,
which was dangerous.

1131
01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.323
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1132
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:14.970
<v 0>but which helped ease the strain.</v>

1133
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:24.370
Now that that section obviously paint something different than what we

1134
01:05:24.681 --> 01:05:28.760
experienced because,
and,
and I,
and you can see what he's talking about.
You know,

1135
01:05:28.761 --> 01:05:32.990
you've got soldiers that don't know what the mission is that don't understand

1136
01:05:32.991 --> 01:05:37.360
what the strategy is.
And you know,
there's all kinds of books about Vietnam and,

1137
01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:39.230
and at the highest,
you know,

1138
01:05:39.231 --> 01:05:43.250
we talk about sometimes how maybe we didn't do a good job of telling people what

1139
01:05:43.251 --> 01:05:47.870
the strategy was.
And,
but at the highest levels in the Vietnam war,

1140
01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:51.830
there's confusion on what the strategy is just so there's no way that some front

1141
01:05:51.831 --> 01:05:56.831
line understands why he's clear in this village and not that village or that

1142
01:05:57.591 --> 01:06:00.380
village and not this religion.
They just don't know.
So what does it become?

1143
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.920
It becomes like they're just robots,

1144
01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.800
human robots moving forward.

1145
01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:12.310
And I think we were very fortunate to be in a situation where,

1146
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.190
you know,
we had a better understanding and,
and,

1147
01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:19.130
and again we talk about this in the book,
we could have done a better job.

1148
01:06:19.131 --> 01:06:22.430
It should have done a better job of making sure that everybody understood more.

1149
01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.170
<v 1>But</v>

1150
01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:27.600
<v 0>there was an understanding,
there was at a minimum,</v>

1151
01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.190
everybody understood at a minimum the evil that was there,

1152
01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:36.060
the evil that was there in Ramadi,
in Iraq,

1153
01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:39.450
that was torturing people,
raping people,
killing people,

1154
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:44.160
trying to enslave people.
Everybody understood that there was evil there.

1155
01:06:44.161 --> 01:06:45.750
And that's what we were fighting against,

1156
01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:51.380
trying to help this local populace who was completely at the mercy of this

1157
01:06:54.450 --> 01:06:57.660
insurgent group,
which by the way had no mercy.

1158
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.380
So I think we had that benefit for us.

1159
01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:07.370
But one thing that is completely unchanged is this talk of this strain,

1160
01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:15.740
the strain that is put on the soldiers on the ground.

1161
01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:21.750
And when you think back to the strain that you felt that your men felt,

1162
01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:26.430
what do you think of w what do you think of when you think of the strain?

1163
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:30.040
<v 2>I can absolutely relate to that.
I mean it's,
it's the,</v>

1164
01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.770
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1165
01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:35.850
<v 2>it's something you and I talked about right when we got home,
when we got home,</v>

1166
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:40.080
it was,
you called it the burden,
right?
When we got,

1167
01:07:40.081 --> 01:07:41.880
we got home and

1168
01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:46.260
I didn't even recognize how powerful that was.

1169
01:07:46.261 --> 01:07:47.970
You know what I remember talking to you about it.
We were like,

1170
01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:51.400
we all of a sudden we could relax.
Like there weren't,

1171
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:53.400
were people trying to kill us right there.

1172
01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.570
There were when we arrived back from that deployment to Ramadi and we're back in

1173
01:07:57.571 --> 01:08:00.170
San Diego and,
and you,

1174
01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.440
and just the recognition that it's not just from our personal,
like,
hey,

1175
01:08:04.441 --> 01:08:08.870
not people aren't trying to kill me,
but like I no longer carrying the burden of,

1176
01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.130
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1177
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.590
<v 2>The decisions that I make and people's lives are on the line,
right?</v>

1178
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.520
Like at this moment right now.

1179
01:08:16.521 --> 01:08:18.990
And I want to make sure that I've thought through all the contingencies,

1180
01:08:18.991 --> 01:08:23.120
you know,
are we ready,
you know,
for,
for the these worst case scenarios,
have,

1181
01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:25.960
we have,
we planned,
you'll have,
we rehearsed these things.
Have we tried,

1182
01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.590
have we thought that what the enemy might do,

1183
01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:29.990
how could they hit us where we hadn't even foreseen it?
You know,
that,

1184
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:34.800
that burden that you just carried all the time.
And,
and for me,
you know,
Matt,

1185
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:39.440
after,
after mark got killed and Ryan got wounded,
it was just,
um,

1186
01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:43.010
you know,
four months into our deployment,
it was just this recognition.
I'm like,

1187
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:47.710
man,
where that can happen at any time.
And I knew it could happen anytime,

1188
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.260
but prior to that,
and it wasn't that we got complacent or that,
but,
but it was,

1189
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.060
we'd gotten away with this so many times that you all,
you,

1190
01:08:54.061 --> 01:08:58.190
you start to kind of see like maybe we can make it through this thing,
you know,

1191
01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:01.400
without losing people as,
as,
uh,

1192
01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:04.700
and just going out there and,
and you know,
as you've talked about,

1193
01:09:04.701 --> 01:09:09.320
you can just only get lucky so many times like with all that evil and all that

1194
01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:13.130
horribleness out there that,
uh,
that

1195
01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:17.040
it can happen anytime.
And that's the strain that I think that I certainly,

1196
01:09:17.041 --> 01:09:19.260
I felt that for other guys felt when you see that your,

1197
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.110
your brothers killed or wounded,
uh,

1198
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.970
when you've had close calls and you recognize like,
just how,
um,

1199
01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:28.750
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1200
01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:32.080
<v 2>how close we are to death anytime,</v>

1201
01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.860
anytime we're rolling out there that uh,
um,
that is a strain.

1202
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.360
It is a strain on you and it's something that wears on you.
Um,
and I,
I think,

1203
01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:41.643
um,

1204
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:43.050
<v 1>okay.</v>

1205
01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:46.200
<v 2>For me,
it was just always,
always worried about like just the,
the,</v>

1206
01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.290
and when you see the violence of it,
you know,
the,

1207
01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:52.380
the vehicle graveyard that we rolled out through every time we're driving out

1208
01:09:52.381 --> 01:09:53.240
the gate and just the,

1209
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:58.510
the twisted hoax of metal that used to be a vehicle that carried men or women in

1210
01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:01.680
them,
uh,
you know,

1211
01:10:01.681 --> 01:10:05.700
and those were US troops that were either killed or horribly wounded that were

1212
01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:09.290
in that vehicle that were destroyed.
Or if you see it,
id go often,

1213
01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:13.240
there's a hundred foot fire ball in the air and just frag,
you know,
the,

1214
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:16.020
the metal fragments raining down,
you know,

1215
01:10:16.021 --> 01:10:19.340
for hundreds of yards in all directions from something like that.
You're like,

1216
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.970
just the power of that,
you know,
the,

1217
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.000
the violence of machine gun fire that's coming in close to you.

1218
01:10:24.001 --> 01:10:27.570
And how I often describe it is just the,
you know,
I wrote about in the book the,

1219
01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.240
the biggest,
strongest guy you can imagine.

1220
01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.550
Just smashing the wall with a hammer next to you,

1221
01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.790
as hard as he can on the inches from your head.
And it's from your head.

1222
01:10:35.791 --> 01:10:39.840
Just throwing concrete fragments everywhere.
And there's,
um,
and,
and you know,

1223
01:10:39.841 --> 01:10:43.890
now it's seven to 800 rounds per minute of that,

1224
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.830
of that coming in at you with a belt fed bell,
fette machine gun.

1225
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:49.670
And maybe there's multiple,
once you've met you RPG rockets,

1226
01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:53.490
just this rocking explosion is rings your bell.
You know,

1227
01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:55.590
even if it's just on the wall outside,
you know,

1228
01:10:55.591 --> 01:10:59.050
if one of those things hits the window and,
and,
and,

1229
01:10:59.051 --> 01:11:01.290
and detonates on the bars on the window,

1230
01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:03.300
it's gonna just frag everybody in the room,

1231
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.860
it's going to be horribly wounded or killed.
So that,

1232
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:10.140
that was a strain all the time.
And I think the difference for us though is the,

1233
01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:15.090
you know,
in,
in any,
you know,
there isn't,
there were some,
certainly some guys,
uh,

1234
01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:16.620
and you talked about leadership that we learned,
right?

1235
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.560
Get the guys carrying those heavy machine guns,
the,

1236
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:21.930
the belt fed machine guns and all the gear that with them.
And they're like,
man,

1237
01:11:21.931 --> 01:11:23.940
do I have to carry this thing?
You know,
as a leader,

1238
01:11:23.941 --> 01:11:25.990
we had to remind them why that was important.
You know,

1239
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:28.800
because they get that love,
hate relationship.
The machine gunners,

1240
01:11:28.801 --> 01:11:31.080
they loved the shoot that machine gun and they're awesome at it.

1241
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:33.160
They hate to carry the machine gun,
right?
It's uh,

1242
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:34.710
it's that love hate relationship.

1243
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:38.850
And so when they're going in on a foot patrol that's a,
you know,
a mile,

1244
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:42.550
mile and a half full petroleum into a tough era and they're carrying all the

1245
01:11:42.551 --> 01:11:45.150
heavy weight,
they get focused on that.
So you've got,

1246
01:11:45.151 --> 01:11:46.520
you've got to help them recognize like this,

1247
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.590
this is why you are such a critical part of the team and why we got to have

1248
01:11:49.591 --> 01:11:52.040
these machine guns.
Um,
so you got to do it,
you know,

1249
01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:53.490
as a leader of something we had to do all the time.

1250
01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:55.990
But I think for these guys in Vietnam,
they're,
you know,
they're,

1251
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.870
they're driving or flying into an area of patrol and into an area that's the,

1252
01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.330
it seems like they're seeing,
they're seeing new terrain all the time.
You know,

1253
01:12:03.331 --> 01:12:07.440
for us in Ramadi,
it was this tiny city that was,
it's like what,

1254
01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:10.370
three by three miles across,
you're talking about just the,
the,

1255
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.540
the central central Ramadi piece of it.

1256
01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:16.860
Very small and we're going into the same areas all the time.
You know,
J street,

1257
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:21.060
the j block,
you know,
Papa 10,
um,
you know,
these areas that,
uh,

1258
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.900
going down baseline road and you know,
to 20th street and these areas that we,

1259
01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.620
we got to know and we understood,
you know,
where the,
the,
the,
uh,

1260
01:12:28.621 --> 01:12:31.500
the bad guys were operating out of and we'd been in so many of these buildings

1261
01:12:31.501 --> 01:12:32.880
and so on.
Then we had to have the,

1262
01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:36.000
we had to mix it up and not patrol down the same streets every time and try to

1263
01:12:36.001 --> 01:12:40.480
come in and do some misdirection stuff.
Uh,
but we got to know these areas.
Um,

1264
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.010
and you know,
even though it was a small area,
you know,

1265
01:12:43.011 --> 01:12:45.570
in these tanks might be less than a mile away from you.

1266
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:49.590
Maybe there have been a half mile down the road,
you know,
in that environment.

1267
01:12:49.591 --> 01:12:50.910
If there's,
if there's,
you know,

1268
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
35 ideas that could destroy any one of which could destroy the tank between you

1269
01:12:57.150 --> 01:13:00.360
and them half a mile away,
they might as well be a hundred miles away.

1270
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:03.400
It doesn't matter.
So,
you know,
we had to plan for those containers.

1271
01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:06.940
We had to be ready,
but that was a strain that I certainly remember well,
and,

1272
01:13:06.941 --> 01:13:10.480
and I,
I remember that conversation as I'm sure you do,
coming back and,
and,

1273
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:13.410
and recognize them.
Like
wow,

1274
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:16.760
I didn't even realize how heavy that strain was until we got back.
And it was,

1275
01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.760
it was,
it was lifted.

1276
01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.730
<v 0>Yeah.
It didn't happen right away.
It happened like we were,
at least,</v>

1277
01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:26.840
I feel like we were conditioned.
It would be,

1278
01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:30.080
it would be like going to a planet where there was much,

1279
01:13:30.081 --> 01:13:32.830
much higher gravity and you're,

1280
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:36.080
you don't even realize how much more weight you're carrying.
And then when,

1281
01:13:36.081 --> 01:13:39.050
when we came home,
it wasn't like an instantly the gravity changed.
It was like,

1282
01:13:39.051 --> 01:13:43.370
it's slowly in one day.
For me,
it was about a month that I,

1283
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:47.990
all of a sudden I woke up and instead of the first thought I had when I woke up

1284
01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.010
of like,
what's going to happen today?
What bad thing can happen today?

1285
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:56.180
It was like,
oh,
I think the waves look good and I'm going surfing.

1286
01:13:56.330 --> 01:14:01.070
And did go from that thought process from like you said,

1287
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.840
it's the horror of the,

1288
01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:07.130
of the imminent danger.

1289
01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:11.120
Because like,
like you said,

1290
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:16.120
you can only get lucky so many times and you go out day after day after day,

1291
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:20.710
and you got,
um,
watching guys all over my guys all over Ramadi.

1292
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:25.770
There's no possible way that they can make it through today without taking a

1293
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:29.380
casualty.
And then they,
and then they make it through that day.

1294
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.330
I got five elements,
three elements,

1295
01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:34.330
five elements to elements all out on the battlefield at the same time.

1296
01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.750
There's no way they're going to make it through today without a casualty.

1297
01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.450
And they make it through today.
And guess what?

1298
01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:44.710
You wake up the next day and now you're carrying that day and today.

1299
01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:46.780
So you make it through that day.

1300
01:14:46.781 --> 01:14:49.750
Now you're carrying three days and that just built and built and built.

1301
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.950
And every once in a while,

1302
01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:56.010
obviously we would take a casualty and maybe you get a little reset,

1303
01:14:56.051 --> 01:15:00.130
but you don't.
It's just there and they're a heavy all the time.

1304
01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:05.110
And what's really interesting about this is you might be thinking is leaf

1305
01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:08.290
explain this.
You explain,
you know those feelings.
And I was,

1306
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:09.370
I'm talking about right now,

1307
01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:14.350
you might think that we were solid and worried and sweat and,

1308
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.610
and panicking or,
but,
but I'm sitting here thinking about it.
We would,

1309
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:24.130
and everybody in the,
in the task unit,
we were having fun.
We were laughing,

1310
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.130
we would have conversations.
We make fun of each other.
We'd make fun of,

1311
01:15:27.131 --> 01:15:29.920
our friends would make fun of our boss.
We make fun of everybody.
We'd laugh,

1312
01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:34.300
we'd have a great time.
And the,
the,
the strain,

1313
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:40.060
even though there's,
there's,
you know,
fun and good times on top of it,

1314
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:43.780
that strain is absolutely there and it stays there the whole time.

1315
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:44.890
And it just builds.

1316
01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:50.130
<v 2>I think the big illustration for that to me was when an operation was going on,</v>

1317
01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:52.140
right.
And vehicles were lined up,
like get,
you know,

1318
01:15:52.141 --> 01:15:55.860
the vehicles are lined up out on the,
we had this main street,
you know,

1319
01:15:55.861 --> 01:16:00.420
outside of,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
the Toc tactical operations center and you know,

1320
01:16:00.421 --> 01:16:03.540
where your office was.
And,
and uh,
I remember that,

1321
01:16:03.541 --> 01:16:05.700
that bond that we had an in tasking at bruiser,
you know,

1322
01:16:05.701 --> 01:16:08.520
so often you get one of the seals are doing their thing and you got to support

1323
01:16:08.521 --> 01:16:12.630
personnel that are running the radios and the CBS that run the cabin.

1324
01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:14.900
They just do different stuff and they don't,
you know,

1325
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.390
what was so awesome about tasking at bruiser was that we line those trucks up

1326
01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.940
and we know we're going out,
we're going out at operation and,
and if you were,

1327
01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.230
weren't,
if you weren't coming on the op,
I know you would,

1328
01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:26.670
you would always be out there,
you know,

1329
01:16:26.671 --> 01:16:29.150
out there shaking everybody's hands and talking to them and it,

1330
01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:33.360
and not in a way of like,
you know,
not in a way that there was more bid.
Right.

1331
01:16:33.361 --> 01:16:36.660
But in a way of like,
just the respect and knowledge that

1332
01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.370
anytime we're going out like it at any one time,
there may be,

1333
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:44.540
there may be,
uh,

1334
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:47.270
any of these guys that are rolling out may not be coming back from this.

1335
01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.490
They may be coming back in a body bag and,
uh,

1336
01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:52.820
and that we had to be ready for that at all the time because it was almost a

1337
01:16:52.821 --> 01:16:56.900
daily,
daily thing.
And I just not only,
you know,
for,
for you and the,

1338
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.360
the support person of the comms guys,
you know,
our,
our,

1339
01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.550
our radio when that were out there,
these aren't seals and there,

1340
01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:04.280
but they're out there getting the radios ready and helping us out.

1341
01:17:04.281 --> 01:17:08.740
And people just come,
you know,
uh,
you know,
uh,
our,
our,
our,
uh,
operations,

1342
01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:12.260
you know,
chief coming out there,
I remember all those guys just lined up,

1343
01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.890
shaking hands,
talking to people.
It was just that.
And for the few offsets,

1344
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:18.440
you know,
that I didn't go on with another,
another,
uh,
uh,

1345
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:22.190
if we had something else going on and another units going out with our guys on a

1346
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:24.020
different operation,
I'm not a part of the same thing.

1347
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:25.580
Like going out there talking to those guys,

1348
01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:28.730
shaking their hands and knowing that like they may not be coming back from that.

1349
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:32.840
Um,
and I think that was the biggest,
that was the biggest to me,

1350
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:36.800
like illustration of like that strain.
And again,
we laughed,
we joked it wasn't,

1351
01:17:36.801 --> 01:17:40.580
there was nothing more,
but we are telling jokes and laughing and kid each other.

1352
01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:44.810
Um,
but uh,
but that was really there.
And I remember we got relieved,
you know,

1353
01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:49.400
by the next seal team,
seal team five that came in.
Um,
and you know,
good,

1354
01:17:49.401 --> 01:17:53.390
good Bros of mine that I'd serve with that because I'd come from CLT five.

1355
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:57.340
Um,
and uh,
knew those guys when they were going out to,
you know,

1356
01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:01.790
I knew what they were going out into,
you know,
and I just remember,
uh,

1357
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.200
going out there for that goodbye to them and shaking their hands and talking to

1358
01:18:05.201 --> 01:18:07.970
him.
Dot.
Cause we knew exactly what they're going into and they're going to keep,

1359
01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.580
keep getting after it.
It was one of the,

1360
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:15.710
I remember when those guys came in and I was doing like the turnover brief to

1361
01:18:15.711 --> 01:18:19.490
their whole troop and I was,
you know how to sign,

1362
01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.640
I put a slide up and it was going through this and that and the other thing and

1363
01:18:22.641 --> 01:18:27.380
I'm like,
okay,
you guys are going to take casualties and,

1364
01:18:27.381 --> 01:18:28.214
and

1365
01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:34.190
<v 0>like I never thought in a million years that somebody would be briefing me,</v>

1366
01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:37.170
hey you guys are going to take casualties when I'm like,

1367
01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:42.171
oh you guys might hate is dangerous and it looks like you guys are going to take

1368
01:18:42.421 --> 01:18:46.230
casualties.
That is what is going to happen.
And that might sound negative,

1369
01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:51.540
but that was the facts that it was 100% true that they were going to take

1370
01:18:51.541 --> 01:18:53.190
casualties.
And we knew it,
we knew it.

1371
01:18:53.191 --> 01:18:58.191
And that's what was so hard to shake their hand and tell him goodbye and good

1372
01:18:58.741 --> 01:18:59.574
luck and,

1373
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.760
and watch them roll out for the first time alone without us and know that could

1374
01:19:04.891 --> 01:19:08.990
be tonight and
could be tonight.

1375
01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.553
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1376
01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:20.043
<v 0>I'm going new.
Uh,</v>

1377
01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.720
<v 2>hit one hit another section right now.</v>

1378
01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:31.360
<v 0>This is talking about talking about the men again</v>

1379
01:19:34.330 --> 01:19:35.230
<v 1>going to the book</v>

1380
01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:41.390
<v 0>for the most part,
they carried themselves with poise,</v>

1381
01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:45.460
a kind of dignity now and then however,

1382
01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.920
<v 1>there were times of panic</v>

1383
01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:53.400
<v 0>when they squealed or wanted to squeal but couldn't when they twitched and made</v>

1384
01:19:53.401 --> 01:19:58.110
moaning sounds and covered their heads and said dear Jesus and flopped around on

1385
01:19:58.111 --> 01:20:01.830
the earth and fired their weapons blindly and cringed and sobbed and begged for

1386
01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:06.690
the noise to stop and went wild and made stupid promises to themselves and to

1387
01:20:06.691 --> 01:20:11.460
God and to their mothers and fathers hoping not to die.

1388
01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:21.840
And back to what we were just talking about

1389
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:26.800
to have guys,
and you know,
we,

1390
01:20:27.010 --> 01:20:31.920
we did a podcast about a guy named colonel to peak and his,

1391
01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.320
his book called Battle Studies.

1392
01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.700
And when he describes men who,
one of his key points.

1393
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1394
01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:46.260
<v 0>Is he saying that men are horrified and they're scared of death and that they</v>

1395
01:20:50.381 --> 01:20:52.480
have this just incredible,

1396
01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:59.250
obviously this under underlying the will of self preservation,

1397
01:21:00.491 --> 01:21:00.991
right.
That's the,

1398
01:21:00.991 --> 01:21:05.140
that's the thing that fuels people and he just talks about this tiny percentage

1399
01:21:05.141 --> 01:21:05.680
of,

1400
01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:10.680
of men that will overcome that and there'll be brave

1401
01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.540
and to think that we were lucky enough to serve with guys in our task unit and

1402
01:21:20.221 --> 01:21:25.221
to see the next task unit to come in and to see the soldiers and see the marines

1403
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:29.790
to overcome that strain on a daily basis.

1404
01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:33.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1405
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.070
<v 0>That is absolutely one of the most humbling things that I think I will ever</v>

1406
01:21:38.071 --> 01:21:39.210
experience in my life.

1407
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.393
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.100
<v 2>That's what,
that's what courage is all about.
You know,
I think,
uh,</v>

1409
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.810
just to,
to see guys,
you know,

1410
01:21:48.811 --> 01:21:53.580
that are just in the thick of the fight with bullets missing their heads by

1411
01:21:53.581 --> 01:21:56.250
inches.
You know,
I remember,
uh,

1412
01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.320
our member on the rooftop of building 99,

1413
01:22:01.321 --> 01:22:04.440
right on 20th street in the war.
We were getting hammered.
I mean,

1414
01:22:04.441 --> 01:22:08.170
enemy rounds coming in by hundreds and hundreds of routes coming to shatter the

1415
01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:13.080
windows.
And I remember our,
our EOD bomb disposal technician,
awesome,

1416
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.950
awesome guy.
He's,

1417
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:18.600
he's a lean on the rooftop and there's armor piercing rounds coming through the

1418
01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:21.480
roof,
punching through concrete wall,
you know,

1419
01:22:21.481 --> 01:22:26.120
d that's just like three inches over his head and he's just laying there and,

1420
01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.890
and I remember crawling up there trying to figure out how is everybody okay?

1421
01:22:28.891 --> 01:22:31.400
And he's like looking at me like thumbs up laughing about it.

1422
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:36.180
And I'm just the humor of those guys,
right?
Dealing with that.
Um,
and no one,

1423
01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:39.840
you know,
again,
that that could happen at any time,
but,
you know,
um,

1424
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:43.950
just seeing the guys guys like Mark Lee or I just the most hilarious guy you

1425
01:22:43.951 --> 01:22:48.420
could imagine.
Just cracking jokes,
you know,
and sing in the,
you know,

1426
01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.230
the cheese ball,
eighties tunes,
you know,
I am the warrior and,
uh,

1427
01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:55.080
and the US laughing about it,
talking about that stuff and just,

1428
01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:58.530
just that's how they dealt with it,
you know,
and,
and,
and,

1429
01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.410
but it just tremendous courage and,
you know,
not just our seals,

1430
01:23:01.411 --> 01:23:03.870
not just guys that,
that we work with those,

1431
01:23:03.871 --> 01:23:06.040
those marines and the soldiers that we served

1432
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.660
<v 0>alongside and just watching those guys day in and day out,
you know,</v>

1433
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:14.320
um,
who often didn't have as much control over what they were doing is we did,

1434
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.770
you know,
at down at the frontline level.
Um,

1435
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:22.720
but just out there getting after it with a great attitude.
Uh,
and,
you know,

1436
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:26.770
nope,
nobody's fearless,
right?
Nobody,
you know,
some people think,
oh,
that,
uh,
we,

1437
01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:29.530
you know,
we get that question all the time,
right?
From businesses like,
well,
it's,

1438
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:34.590
you know,
it's more mortals are,
you know,
fearful,
but you guys are fearless.

1439
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:36.190
Like,
no,
nobody's fearless.
Like you,

1440
01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:39.820
you recognize how mortal you are and that can happen anytime.

1441
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:44.090
And yet you see these guys just just totally selfless.
You know,

1442
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:48.010
courage would just incredible courage to overcome that and just amazing.

1443
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:51.940
I mean that's,
that's really to me that is the,

1444
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:55.480
that is the bright light,
you know,
that we brought back from,
you know,

1445
01:23:55.481 --> 01:23:59.920
from that conflict to see and witness that and just the tremendous human spirit

1446
01:23:59.921 --> 01:24:00.790
that could overcome anything.

1447
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:03.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1448
01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:05.813
<v 0>Indeed.</v>

1449
01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:11.110
You're going to kind of wrap up this section right now with one last little

1450
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:16.000
piece of the book here.
And this is one of the guys being lavender,

1451
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:17.430
last name lavender.

1452
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:22.530
He gets killed and the lieutenant takes the blame himself.

1453
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:25.780
He feels that that blame

1454
01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:31.120
and part of it,
he kind of blames on his,

1455
01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:34.960
his thinking about his girl back home,
Martha.

1456
01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:38.770
And He's thinking he wasn't doing everything he could do and

1457
01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:44.970
what could he have done better and where did he let his guys down and what he

1458
01:24:44.971 --> 01:24:48.480
could do different from now on.
And I'm going to the book.

1459
01:24:49.890 --> 01:24:52.680
He loved her,
but he hated her.

1460
01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:57.870
No more fantasies.

1461
01:24:57.871 --> 01:25:02.520
He told himself hence forth when he thought about Martha.

1462
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:07.380
It would be only to think that she belonged elsewhere.

1463
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:12.450
He would shut down the daydreams.
This was not Mount Sebastian.

1464
01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:17.540
It was another world where there were no pretty poems or midterm exams.

1465
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.830
A place where men died because of carelessness and grow stupidity.

1466
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:25.650
Kiowa was right,

1467
01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:30.540
boom down and you were dead.

1468
01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.370
Never partly dead.

1469
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:34.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1470
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.510
<v 0>Briefly in the rain,</v>

1471
01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:40.920
Lieutenant Cross saw Martha's gray eyes gazing back at him.

1472
01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:46.270
He understood
it was very sad.

1473
01:25:46.271 --> 01:25:51.271
He thought the things men carried inside the things med did or felt they had to

1474
01:25:54.041 --> 01:25:58.840
do.
He almost nodded at her,
but he didn't.

1475
01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.130
Instead he went back to his maps.

1476
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.980
He was now determined to perform his duties firmly and without negligence it

1477
01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:12.290
wouldn't help lavender.
He knew that,

1478
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:17.330
but from this point on he would comport himself as an officer.

1479
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.940
He would dispose of his good luck,
pebble swallow.

1480
01:26:21.941 --> 01:26:26.941
It may be or use Lli Strunk sling shot or just drop it along the trail.

1481
01:26:29.410 --> 01:26:33.460
On the march he would impose strict feel discipline.

1482
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:38.050
He would be careful to send out flank security to prevent straggling,

1483
01:26:38.051 --> 01:26:41.440
are bunching up to keep his troops moving at the proper pace.

1484
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:46.060
And at the proper interval,
he would insist on clean weapons.

1485
01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:51.180
He would confiscate the remainder of lavender's dope later in the day.

1486
01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:56.020
Perhaps he would call the men together and speak to them plainly.

1487
01:26:57.810 --> 01:27:00.900
He would accept the blame for what had happened at Ted lavender.

1488
01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.580
He would be a man about it.

1489
01:27:04.050 --> 01:27:09.050
He would look them in the eyes keeping his chin level and he would issue new sop

1490
01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:14.190
in a calm interpret in personal tone of voice,

1491
01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.260
a lieutenant's voice leaving no room for argument or discussion

1492
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.700
commencing immediately.

1493
01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:26.870
He'd tell them they would no longer abandoned equipment along the route of
March.

1494
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:29.090
They would police up their acts,

1495
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:34.210
they would get their shit together and keep it together and maintain it neatly

1496
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:36.620
and in good working order.

1497
01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:41.160
He would not tolerate laxity.

1498
01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:47.670
He would show strength distancing himself.

1499
01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:01.680
So he falls back on what we fall back on all the time on discipline,

1500
01:28:03.041 --> 01:28:04.690
on standard operating procedures,

1501
01:28:04.691 --> 01:28:08.800
on maintaining everything in good working order.

1502
01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:14.100
And one of the things that you can see here in people we get this too is you'd

1503
01:28:15.221 --> 01:28:16.570
think these guys from Vietnam,

1504
01:28:17.890 --> 01:28:20.860
of course they're going to be paying attention.

1505
01:28:20.861 --> 01:28:22.120
Of course they're going to keep their weapon.

1506
01:28:22.150 --> 01:28:24.010
Your weapon keeps you alive in a firefight.

1507
01:28:24.011 --> 01:28:27.910
Of course you're going to keep your weapons clean.
But he as the leader,

1508
01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:29.920
he has to lead.

1509
01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:37.740
And I think that's a common misconception.
And we do talk about it all the time.

1510
01:28:37.741 --> 01:28:41.400
And just one of the most frequent questions I get asked,
like,
well,
you know,

1511
01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:45.180
in the seal teams you've got everyone's motivated and everyone's focused and

1512
01:28:45.181 --> 01:28:47.130
it's a life or death,
you know,

1513
01:28:47.131 --> 01:28:49.500
so they're going to stay sharp and they're going to follow procedure no matter

1514
01:28:49.501 --> 01:28:52.830
what.
And you know,
my,
my team's not like that in the business world.
Or you know,

1515
01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:54.210
people I work with aren't like that.

1516
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:58.800
And the best teams,

1517
01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:01.680
they only follow that,
right?

1518
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.060
<v 2>Because they've got leaders that are stepping up and making it happen.
And look,</v>

1519
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:08.790
we have some amazing people in the seal teams,

1520
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.590
just like we have some amazing people in the military,
um,

1521
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:15.240
in army and marine units and,
and other special operations units,
et Cetera.

1522
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.890
But even with life or death on the line,
people get complacent.

1523
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:22.050
People start letting the ball drop,

1524
01:29:22.051 --> 01:29:24.870
not cleaning their weapons and when they need to or are not following a

1525
01:29:24.871 --> 01:29:29.850
procedure or letting their guard down because well we've done this operation a

1526
01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:33.450
dozen times and nothing bad's happened so nothing bad's going to happen.
Right.

1527
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:33.750
That's,

1528
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:38.010
it's like this common human emotion that you just make these assumptions and so

1529
01:29:38.011 --> 01:29:42.820
the only way that units are going to stay focused and not have that happen it

1530
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:44.040
when they've got good leaders,

1531
01:29:44.041 --> 01:29:47.580
they got a fire team leader in charge of his four guys is stepping up and making

1532
01:29:47.581 --> 01:29:50.740
sure that his guys were squared away and stay in focus.
They've got,
you know,

1533
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.910
they've got a squad leader making sure that his squad is squared.

1534
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:57.630
The LPO leading petty officer is out there making sure that guys are dialed or

1535
01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:00.300
not cutting corners.
I mean,
I always saw that with guys,
you know,

1536
01:30:00.301 --> 01:30:01.790
we've been in the sniper,
Overwatch positions,

1537
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:06.220
you got like some of them had like one stairwell in and out and someone's going

1538
01:30:06.221 --> 01:30:07.054
to watch that stairwell.

1539
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.800
Someone's got to have a weapon and looking down that stairwell for 72 hours.

1540
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:14.610
And so hopefully we can rotate some guys out.
So it's not just the same guy,
but,

1541
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:17.110
but even so if it's going to be several hours.

1542
01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:20.490
So you watched him down that stairwell and it's boring as hell,
right?

1543
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.410
And guess what?

1544
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.200
You're the only guy watching that stairwell and everyone else has got their

1545
01:30:25.201 --> 01:30:27.480
backs to you.
So if you're not doing your job,

1546
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:31.590
you're going to be those people get shot in the back.
And yet if what happens,

1547
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:34.830
hey,
hey,
I've been here,
I've been on the stairwell.
It looked,
man doesn't,

1548
01:30:34.831 --> 01:30:37.860
we've done this operation dozen times or we've been in this building multiple

1549
01:30:37.861 --> 01:30:40.260
times.
Nobody's ever come up the stairs.

1550
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:43.800
I've been sitting here for hours on end like hasn't happened.

1551
01:30:43.801 --> 01:30:47.610
So you people will fall asleep.
People will stop paying attention.

1552
01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:52.470
And only if you've got good leaders who are going to go check on that guy and

1553
01:30:52.471 --> 01:30:56.280
make sure that he recognizes that,
listen,
everybody's dependent on you.
You know,

1554
01:30:56.281 --> 01:30:58.920
not only you're going to get killed if someone slips up the stairs,
but the guys,

1555
01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:01.530
people are gonna get shot in the back and they were dependent on you to have

1556
01:31:01.531 --> 01:31:01.980
their back.

1557
01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:05.880
And it requires those good leaders at every level of stepping up and going and

1558
01:31:05.881 --> 01:31:08.480
checking on that guy.
And if he is tired,
he can't stay awake,
rotating out,

1559
01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:12.330
put somebody else in there.
But it requires leadership at every level.
Um,

1560
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:15.840
so even with life and death and a lot people get complacent and this really goes

1561
01:31:15.841 --> 01:31:18.000
to what you and I talk about all the time,

1562
01:31:18.001 --> 01:31:21.570
which is what does it really mean to take care of your people,
you know,

1563
01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:24.180
that year?
Well,
I want to be liked,
you know,

1564
01:31:24.181 --> 01:31:27.470
so I don't want to be a real hard ass and I don't want to,
you know,

1565
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:29.910
I don't want to like,
um,
you know,

1566
01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:33.300
I don't want to push too hard in that direction.
Or like if they cut this corner,

1567
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:35.440
maybe it's not that big of a deal.
Uh,
and,

1568
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.710
and obviously you can go too far in that direction,
right?

1569
01:31:37.711 --> 01:31:38.910
But you become the slave driver.
But,

1570
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:42.420
but are you really taking care of your people if you're allowing them to cut

1571
01:31:42.421 --> 01:31:45.230
some corners that they shouldn't be,
you know,

1572
01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:49.080
are to get complacent when they shouldn't be.
And the answer is no,
of course not.

1573
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:51.290
You're setting them up for failure.
Um,

1574
01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:56.180
and so you as a leader have got to step up and a and make sure that your peer,

1575
01:31:56.181 --> 01:31:58.890
you know,
the peers around you,
if you're not in a leadership position,
um,

1576
01:31:58.891 --> 01:32:00.220
it certainly as a leader,

1577
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.240
<v 0>make sure that your team and those around you are towing the line and fall on</v>

1578
01:32:04.241 --> 01:32:05.680
those standard operating procedures and,
and,

1579
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.490
and achieve and that highest standard possible because that's what is going to

1580
01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:13.120
allow them to stay alive on the battlefield and ultimately accomplish the

1581
01:32:13.121 --> 01:32:17.410
mission and certainly dominate and win on their battlefield anywhere in business

1582
01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:21.340
in life.
Yeah,
you can definitely see that.

1583
01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:26.680
All the things that Lieutenant Cross rattles off that he's going to now start

1584
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:29.710
imposing.
He's going to start taking care of.

1585
01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:32.440
He thought he was taking care of his men before by,

1586
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:36.460
by letting them have dirty weapons and not hounding them about that by letting

1587
01:32:36.461 --> 01:32:39.910
them drop gear on the trail by not sending out flank security cause it's a pain

1588
01:32:39.911 --> 01:32:40.480
in the ass.

1589
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:44.350
He thought he was taking care of his guys and he got one of his guys killed.

1590
01:32:44.710 --> 01:32:49.710
And that is exactly the point when you're taking care of your people,

1591
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.780
that means you're taking care of them.
That means you're holding the line,

1592
01:32:52.781 --> 01:32:55.780
you're holding the discipline and you're making sure that they are

1593
01:32:58.030 --> 01:33:02.080
as safe as you can possibly make them while still accomplishing the mission.

1594
01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:07.043
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1595
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:08.440
<v 0>and that is the,</v>

1596
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:14.470
that's pretty much what we had for this book by the way.
Again,

1597
01:33:14.471 --> 01:33:18.340
it's called Tim O'brien.
The name of the book is called the things they carried.

1598
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.950
Definitely a,
a,

1599
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:25.360
a solid read in and I would check it out and echo will have it up on the,

1600
01:33:25.361 --> 01:33:27.850
on the website.
And yeah,

1601
01:33:27.851 --> 01:33:32.851
I know for those of you that are going to come at me and say it was a fiction

1602
01:33:33.581 --> 01:33:33.771
book,

1603
01:33:33.771 --> 01:33:37.510
so now you're going to start submitting to me every fiction war book that's ever

1604
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:38.920
been written.
I don't know.

1605
01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:41.170
There's some damn good ones out there and there's probably some I'm going to end

1606
01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:45.490
up doing.
But um,
yeah,
this is one of them that is,
and again,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1607
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.810
it's fiction,

1608
01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:51.500
but clearly it's based on the experiences and it,
and,

1609
01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:52.480
and once again,

1610
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.600
you can see that even though war evolves and war changes,

1611
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.010
the fundamental,

1612
01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:05.850
the fundamentals of human nature in war don't really change.

1613
01:34:08.150 --> 01:34:10.960
I'm not into fiction books.
I don't remember the last time I read a fiction book.

1614
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:14.500
I'm going to read that book because that immediately resonated with me and puts

1615
01:34:14.501 --> 01:34:18.150
me back in those,
just the sights and smells and then,
uh,

1616
01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.600
and the stuff that we carried and opens up.
So,
you know,
it's just,
uh,
I look,

1617
01:34:22.601 --> 01:34:24.760
I look forward to digging into it in some detail,
the good one.

1618
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:29.320
And you know that that's a thing when,
when you are dealing with these books

1619
01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:32.410
and you start to really,

1620
01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:36.890
really listened to them and read them,
there's just,

1621
01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.690
there's always so much more than an

1622
01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:44.300
then you get out of it the first time you go through it.
So that's why for me,

1623
01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:45.351
you know,

1624
01:34:45.351 --> 01:34:49.910
reading it and then going through it again and then sitting here and reading it

1625
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:53.360
and,
and now when I put the headphones on and read it,
it's it.
They definitely,

1626
01:34:53.361 --> 01:34:57.050
they definitely hit you and you get more out of them in my opinion.
No,

1627
01:34:57.390 --> 01:35:00.040
there's something magical about putting the headphones on,
you know,
cause you,

1628
01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.260
you had read a couple of those experts and we were talking about this over the

1629
01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.650
last couple of days and what the podcast is going to be bad and it did not.

1630
01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:07.510
It did not.

1631
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:10.450
You know what's sitting here listening to you read it with the headphones on.

1632
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:14.330
It's like takes me immediately back to Ramadi,
thinking about the stuff that we,

1633
01:35:14.331 --> 01:35:14.600
you know,

1634
01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.810
the things that we carried with us and the moon dust that we patrolled through

1635
01:35:17.811 --> 01:35:22.340
and those smells and statues and the heat.
And um,
frankly,
uh,
I'm,

1636
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.530
I'm pretty eager to go back and get something right now.

1637
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:29.000
I'm ready to make it happen.
He indeed,
and you know,
what we got to do is,

1638
01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:34.790
it's the same thing with,
with these other books with,
with our book and,

1639
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:38.300
and I know,
you know,
we were kind of talking about this a little bit.
You know,

1640
01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:41.480
when you write a book,
you're confined in,

1641
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:46.510
in some way to the structure of the book and to the length of the book and to

1642
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.440
the balance of the book.

1643
01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:52.490
And so you can't just drill down on some facet.

1644
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:54.140
That might be,

1645
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:59.030
it might not be totally pertinent to that particular way and then it's laid out.

1646
01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:03.500
But what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to get the next time

1647
01:36:03.501 --> 01:36:07.190
you come on,
we gotta do,
we gotta do our own book.

1648
01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:10.880
We got to do extreme ownership at least get it through a few chapters because,

1649
01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.780
because we,
we know the authors,
you know,

1650
01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.140
and we know that there's so much back behind those that it would be awesome to

1651
01:36:18.141 --> 01:36:21.860
sit there and,
and kind of give a bunch of those,
you know,

1652
01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:25.400
a bunch of the backstory behind these things.
And I think next time we got to,

1653
01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.140
we got to make that happen.
Let's do it.
I like that idea.
There's a,

1654
01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.240
there's so much there and it is a,
even going back and reviewing the book,

1655
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:33.920
you're thinking about these little things,
I'm like,
oh,

1656
01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:36.330
we should've said that obviously doesn't illustrate this,
you know,

1657
01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:39.530
the the point and we got to focus it.
But uh,
yeah,
there's a lot,

1658
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:42.690
a lot behind that.
I mean,
I think about that blue on blue scenario,
you know,

1659
01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.630
it just opening tapper,

1660
01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:49.250
extreme ownership and what that was about it all that went into that.
Um,
and uh,

1661
01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.110
yeah,
be great to talk about that in some detail.

1662
01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.610
We'll have to get that next time.
Now.
Extreme ownership and name of the book.

1663
01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:01.310
Extreme ownership is also the name of something else that's about to happen.

1664
01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:04.580
May 4th and fifth the muster,

1665
01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.200
the extreme ownership monster leadership conference,

1666
01:37:09.201 --> 01:37:13.190
I guess is that appropriate to call it a leadership conference?
I'm not sure.

1667
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.540
I guess we had to classify what it is then maybe we put in that category.

1668
01:37:17.541 --> 01:37:20.240
But to me the muster stands by itself,
you know,

1669
01:37:20.241 --> 01:37:23.790
and I think the definitions that you know that we utilize a gathering together,

1670
01:37:23.791 --> 01:37:26.420
a troops to prepare for war.

1671
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.390
I guess that fits very probably so I,

1672
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:34.050
I can't say I go into like big details about the monster,
but I,

1673
01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.520
I just mention it in case people are interested in getting

1674
01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:43.880
better,
especially from a leadership perspective and really from a

1675
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:49.520
human
potential,
you know,

1676
01:37:49.521 --> 01:37:53.300
getting to where you think you can get getting beyond where you can think you

1677
01:37:53.301 --> 01:37:56.050
can get,
I don't talk too much these about whatever for,

1678
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.420
<v 2>so since you're here and you're sitting here,
what do you think?</v>

1679
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:03.260
What's the what,
what,
what did you,
what were like the highlights of the monster?

1680
01:38:03.261 --> 01:38:07.200
Cause if we just did the first one last year in October,

1681
01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:10.410
2017 I thought it was going to be cool.
2016 Oh sorry,

1682
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:14.970
2016 I what did I say,
2017 oh yeah,
that hasn't happened yet.

1683
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:19.770
I thought that the mustard would be cool.
You know what I mean?
I thought,
hey,

1684
01:38:19.771 --> 01:38:21.720
this is going to be cool.
Like it's gonna be cool.

1685
01:38:21.721 --> 01:38:24.510
We're going to meet a bunch of cool people and we're going to talk about all

1686
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:29.280
this cool stuff and do our best to pass on information and give and receive

1687
01:38:29.281 --> 01:38:30.900
information and all that.
So I thought it was gonna be cool,

1688
01:38:31.890 --> 01:38:35.130
but it was a lot better than cool.
It was.
It was frigging awesome.

1689
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:39.720
And what were like some highlights for you when you think about it?

1690
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.020
What are you excited about for New York?
Well,
you know,

1691
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:48.090
we talked to so many people all the time,
right?
And,
and,
and,
and awesome leaders,

1692
01:38:48.091 --> 01:38:48.301
you know,

1693
01:38:48.301 --> 01:38:52.370
from colleagues that we work with and different organizations out there and,

1694
01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:56.250
and it's just loved bloodwork and these leaders love talking to them.

1695
01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.970
I think for the muster was there was just something magical about that.
You know,

1696
01:38:59.971 --> 01:39:03.780
I remember,
uh,
I,
we couldn't have even predicted that.
Right?
I think,

1697
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:07.890
I think you just came up with a new tagline,
come to the muster.
It's magical.

1698
01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:14.100
Come up with a new word.
I'm going to take some shit for that.
Come to the,

1699
01:39:14.101 --> 01:39:18.180
and we're going to call it the magical muster.
Maybe we need to cut that.

1700
01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:22.560
They're going to be cut.
So what was,
what was magical about it?

1701
01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.000
Look for me,
what was it?
Here's,
here's,

1702
01:39:27.001 --> 01:39:31.170
here's what a coming off the stage where we're talking about,
you know,

1703
01:39:31.171 --> 01:39:34.570
we're leaving people with the idea of why,
you know,

1704
01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:36.510
they need to take advantage of every day,

1705
01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:41.570
the gift that's been given to them by those brave warriors that gave their lives

1706
01:39:42.031 --> 01:39:44.640
so that they have the ability to pursue that.
You know?
And uh,

1707
01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:46.860
I remember cutting off stage that you gave me,
you just came up,

1708
01:39:46.861 --> 01:39:51.570
gave me a big hug.
You're not a hugger.
I don't know.
People weren't often,

1709
01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.870
it actually not at to take down at all.
We'll call it.

1710
01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:55.800
I thought maybe something like that was coming.
I was getting,

1711
01:39:55.801 --> 01:39:59.670
I was getting ready.
I was getting,
you're getting ready to do as a sprawl,
but,
uh,

1712
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:03.840
I remember that just,
just that emotion of like,
this was an amazing event.

1713
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:08.290
It was an amazing event.
I think what made it amazing was the,
you know,

1714
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:11.470
we were able to interact with so many people,
you know,
on,

1715
01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.600
on so many people that were in the game and had the same goals,

1716
01:40:17.851 --> 01:40:21.240
the same drive.
Exactly.
And from so many different walks of life.
You know,

1717
01:40:21.241 --> 01:40:24.210
we had some awesome,
we had some really high power,
you know,

1718
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:27.470
senior executives from,
from some great companies,
uh,

1719
01:40:27.710 --> 01:40:32.520
to mid level managers and frontline leaders that are just aspiring to take on

1720
01:40:32.521 --> 01:40:36.280
greater ownership entrepreneurs,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,
um,

1721
01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.810
military law enforcement,
firefighters,
paramedics,
I mean,

1722
01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:43.800
across the space and people that we couldn't even envision or imagine from,

1723
01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.300
you know,
from,
from a volunteer,
you know,

1724
01:40:46.301 --> 01:40:48.790
nonprofit organizations and things like that.
Um,

1725
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:53.620
and interacting with so many different people that are eager to learn to

1726
01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:56.680
implement the,
the president was extremely honored to in the their lives.

1727
01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:59.170
That was awesome for me.
It was interesting to me.

1728
01:40:59.171 --> 01:41:03.400
Some I hadn't even thought about is the fact that,
um,
you,
after we spent folks,

1729
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:05.530
so many people that come up to me and said,
you know,
it was,

1730
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:09.460
it was worth the price of admission alone just to meet other participants here

1731
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:14.530
and learn from them and learn from each other,
you know,
fellow troopers.
And,
uh,

1732
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:17.230
and it was,
it was just,
it was awesome to see that.
So for me,
you know,

1733
01:41:17.231 --> 01:41:19.180
all the events,
we speak at events all the time and we,

1734
01:41:19.181 --> 01:41:22.420
and we speak at great events,
uh,
and we work with great leaders,

1735
01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:27.421
but it was the absolute best event of all time that I've ever been a part of the

1736
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:32.180
best audience,
you know,
and I'm,
I'm so fired up to go back.
Uh,

1737
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.760
and it's going to be,
it's going to be that much better in New York,
right?
Oh,

1738
01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:35.441
it's going to be,

1739
01:41:35.441 --> 01:41:38.050
there'll be a few of the same folks that are going to come in and attend that

1740
01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:41.590
were there in San Diego and there'll be a whole new group of people who couldn't

1741
01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:45.490
come it,
it'll be even bigger.
Um,
and it's going to be awesome.

1742
01:41:45.491 --> 01:41:47.380
One of the things that,
that was awesome for me,

1743
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:49.420
and I know it was awesome for you too,
cause we talked about it,

1744
01:41:49.421 --> 01:41:52.540
but the interaction that we had with everybody,
right?
And,

1745
01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.370
and I remember when we were kind of setting and planning the event,

1746
01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:01.540
that was one of the things where,
you know,
we were talking about this,

1747
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:03.370
we're going,
hey,
we do this and we can have this person we've had.

1748
01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:06.940
And finally I just was like,
hey bro,
you know what we need to do?

1749
01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.670
We need to just be there.
No backstage,
no curtain,
nothing.

1750
01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:17.700
We need to meet and interact and answer questions and get in the game with

1751
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:22.510
everybody.
And that's exactly what we did.
Like,
for instance,
you know,
there's,

1752
01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:24.600
there's,
we do a section,
we'd be,

1753
01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.880
we'd be up talking for an hour answering questions for an hour and a half.

1754
01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:30.130
When we get done with that hour and a half,

1755
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:35.700
we would just step forward to the stage and step down onto the floor and there'd

1756
01:42:35.711 --> 01:42:37.870
be people lined up to say,
Hey,
what about this?
Hey,

1757
01:42:37.871 --> 01:42:39.670
you just said that and what do you think I should do here?

1758
01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:43.870
And it was like that for,
for two straight days and not just after the sessions,

1759
01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:45.370
but a morning workouts.
Right.

1760
01:42:45.371 --> 01:42:49.270
And we are r zero four 45 club pts that we're cranking out these awesome

1761
01:42:49.271 --> 01:42:53.260
workouts.
And,
and uh,
and we,
I mean,
all levels of athletes.

1762
01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:57.170
There's some really high end athletes,
black credible belts,

1763
01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:00.590
she jujitsu players to,
to the,
uh,
you know,
just,

1764
01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:03.280
just some folks who have just started training or just started hitting the gym

1765
01:43:03.281 --> 01:43:05.710
and the courage to about podcasts or whatnot.
Um,

1766
01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:08.620
and came out and participated in that.
And I walk into,
you know,

1767
01:43:08.710 --> 01:43:11.590
jogging over two or walking back from those,
the,
those workouts,

1768
01:43:11.710 --> 01:43:13.870
talking to those leaders and people talking about,
hey,

1769
01:43:13.871 --> 01:43:16.780
what would you do in this situation?
You know,
I,
I remember,
uh,
uh,

1770
01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.900
having those conversations with people and you're helping them apply that stuff.

1771
01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:22.280
We've heard through social media,
so many of those people,

1772
01:43:22.281 --> 01:43:24.250
like some of those specific conversations like,

1773
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:27.280
I can't believe how good this word,
here's what's going on.
I'm not,

1774
01:43:27.281 --> 01:43:30.640
I'm now able to,
I just got a promotion,
you know,
based on this that,
you know,

1775
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:33.610
those cat,
that kind of feedback we always talk about,
right.

1776
01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:36.310
There's only two measures that matter,
effective and ineffective.

1777
01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:38.230
And how do you measure that?
It's whether the team is,

1778
01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.340
is accomplishing the mission.
You're effective.

1779
01:43:40.341 --> 01:43:41.350
If you're not accomplishing mission,

1780
01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:43.240
it doesn't matter how hard you work and you're not effective.

1781
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:47.740
And for us that measure effectiveness is that people are actually going out and

1782
01:43:47.741 --> 01:43:50.470
kicking ass in their world and they're getting promoted.

1783
01:43:50.471 --> 01:43:52.190
They're accomplished in their mission.
They're building

1784
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.200
<v 0>a better team,
they're building better relationships with their boss,
you know,</v>

1785
01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.530
with their peers,
with the sub contractor they work for,
with,
you know,
and,
uh,

1786
01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:04.080
they're,
they're being more engaged members of their community,
you know,

1787
01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:08.870
a better parent,
a better coach,
a better team member,
uh,
across all walks of life.

1788
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:12.610
And I think that's really our measure of effectiveness.
Um,
and,
uh,
it was,

1789
01:44:12.611 --> 01:44:15.050
it's just awesome to see so many folks,
uh,

1790
01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:18.740
doing extraordinary things that were part of that,
the,
the muster.
Um,

1791
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:21.200
and so looking forward to that May 4th and fifth in New York.

1792
01:44:21.201 --> 01:44:24.110
It's going to be awesome and it's gotta be exactly what you described.

1793
01:44:24.111 --> 01:44:24.410
We're going to,

1794
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:28.790
we're going to keep that no matter how long we do this or how big the musters

1795
01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:33.230
get,
I never want to never want it to be a,
to lose that of,

1796
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:35.750
of me and you staying engaged,
you know,

1797
01:44:35.751 --> 01:44:39.620
with participants not hiding behind the curtain somewhere in the green room,

1798
01:44:39.621 --> 01:44:43.390
but be and out fraud,
talking to people,
talking with leaders,
uh,

1799
01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.950
and helping them apply this stuff to get better at what they do.

1800
01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:49.280
This ain't the wizard of Oz.
We ain't going to be hiding behind the curtain.

1801
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:53.030
And you know,
and you talk about

1802
01:44:55.090 --> 01:44:59.170
measures of success,
effective,
ineffective.
Well for me,

1803
01:44:59.171 --> 01:45:01.870
like the biggest reward from doing the monster,
it's,

1804
01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:06.400
it's similar to what we do with our,
with our business of helping businesses.

1805
01:45:06.401 --> 01:45:09.910
And it's always great to get that feedback.
But to get a mass scale of,
you know,

1806
01:45:09.911 --> 01:45:14.890
three or 400 people and get that feedback about the promotions,
the advancements,

1807
01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.370
the,
the goals achieve the fitness goals,
achieved,

1808
01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.350
the relationship goals to get that feedback has just been,
it's been awesome.

1809
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:26.860
So like you said,
we look forward to seeing you there and you know,

1810
01:45:27.490 --> 01:45:29.920
actually speaking of the muster,

1811
01:45:31.570 --> 01:45:33.850
you're going to see life.
Yeah,
you're going to see me.

1812
01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.020
Of course you're going to see JP and Dave,
Dave Burke,

1813
01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.820
JP Denelle,
they're going to be there.

1814
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:45.740
You're also going to see Echo Charles.
He's going to be there fully,

1815
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:50.810
fully,
and kind of cruising too.
But he's going to be not fully cruising hard

1816
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:56.570
so you can get to meet,
oh,
most people want to meet echo the most.

1817
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:59.370
He's like the bass player in the band that like,
no,

1818
01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:01.160
you know there's the lead guitarist

1819
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:06.920
and then there's the lead vocalist who is out front with the weird pants on.

1820
01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.180
But everyone looks at the basis in the back that's hammering down the tracks,

1821
01:46:11.181 --> 01:46:15.020
laying it down,
Echo Charles cruising,
you're going to get to meet him.

1822
01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.330
So that was amazing to me.

1823
01:46:17.331 --> 01:46:21.080
Actually the number of people lined up to take pictures with you and talk to it

1824
01:46:21.081 --> 01:46:25.250
to you as I was.
I was getting jealous.
It was like,
that was awesome.
Funny.

1825
01:46:25.251 --> 01:46:29.210
They don't ask me like real questions though.
It's more like on a social level,

1826
01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:33.100
which I liked that you want to keep it that way.
Easy questions.

1827
01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:36.530
You got to share leadership question.
You can go to lay if you can go to me,

1828
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:38.870
if you want to do some socializing,

1829
01:46:39.010 --> 01:46:42.860
you know like getting that Echo Charles line going shake his hand.

1830
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:46.940
You want to get an echo Charles line one.

1831
01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:49.470
One thing about the buster in New York in particular is,
uh,
you know,

1832
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:50.100
like anything

1833
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.500
<v 3>in New York City got limited space and,
uh,
we,</v>

1834
01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:55.640
we sold a lot of tickets to that thing already.
If you want to be there for four,

1835
01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:58.560
it May 4th and fifth get your tickets now because I think we're going to sell

1836
01:46:58.561 --> 01:47:01.800
this thing out.
And uh,
I think that's,
that's highly likely.

1837
01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:06.180
So those may not be there.
I would,
I would get those things purchased asap.

1838
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:09.750
Um,
if you,
if you want to be a part of that,
do it.

1839
01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:14.940
Big Part that I noticed from the last muster is the,
Pete,

1840
01:47:14.941 --> 01:47:16.830
you mentioned this before where people,
they'll come in,

1841
01:47:16.831 --> 01:47:20.390
they'll learn all this cool stuff and you know,
likeminded people.
Um,

1842
01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.310
but they become like real good friends,
you know,
so like,
uh,

1843
01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.240
like that night when we had a [inaudible] training that night,

1844
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.560
you could tell I thought that,
oh,
these guys came,
they all came together.
Yeah.
No,

1845
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:32.520
they didn't come.
They go there,

1846
01:47:32.610 --> 01:47:35.310
they just became friends and now they're cruising as friends now.

1847
01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.090
And there's people,
you know,
doing things now.
Yeah,

1848
01:47:39.450 --> 01:47:43.810
we've got podcasts.
Yup.
Yup.
Radians and in radio.

1849
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:48.180
And also,
um,
Debbie,
Debbie,

1850
01:47:48.181 --> 01:47:51.990
Debbie and Sonya and Sonya.
Yeah,
they got a podcast going.
There's someone else.

1851
01:47:52.710 --> 01:47:57.090
Anyways,
so there's people that are,
that's the Wa Athena's podcast.

1852
01:47:57.150 --> 01:47:58.770
You've got the trooper podcast,
trooper,

1853
01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:03.750
trooper project modern if modern Athena's.
So there's things that are coming out.

1854
01:48:03.751 --> 01:48:05.850
Those are,
those are people that just met,

1855
01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.980
they weren't friends rolling into the buster.

1856
01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.310
They form relationships and now they're,
I'll just crushing things.

1857
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.350
And that's how,
you know how like,
I mean,

1858
01:48:13.351 --> 01:48:17.760
Jujitsu does this a lot where you come in and you're like by yourself and then

1859
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:20.960
after awhile,
Hey,
this guy likes digits to this guy likes to get to,
oh wait,

1860
01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:23.360
but wait,
hey,
you watched,
I dunno.
You know,
same,

1861
01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:25.980
the same show in slowly like Hawaii,
five o

1862
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:32.790
slowly you start to gravitate towards these people.
But this,

1863
01:48:32.791 --> 01:48:35.040
in this kind of situation,
everyone's kind of like,
um,

1864
01:48:35.490 --> 01:48:39.360
like they're trying to get better,
you know,
better at this.
And it's,
so,

1865
01:48:39.361 --> 01:48:42.180
it's real similar life life in general.

1866
01:48:42.330 --> 01:48:47.190
So it's almost like a double gravitation effect.
You know where people,

1867
01:48:47.191 --> 01:48:49.230
like that's a scientific thing too,
by the way.

1868
01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:54.420
Some of them that you know don't know about the double gravitation effect with

1869
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:59.230
the muster double grab gravitation effect,
easy moral effect across bro.

1870
01:48:59.350 --> 01:49:02.640
And it's funny cause you see it,
you see like everyone's all talking.
You know,

1871
01:49:02.641 --> 01:49:05.340
like if I step back,
I see you in life talking,

1872
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:08.280
you can kind of tell like all you guys have known each other for a long time.

1873
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:10.560
That's kind of what you see.
But then you realize,

1874
01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:12.990
oh they haven't known each other for a long time.
It's just pure double,

1875
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:17.400
double grab had gravitation.
Okay.
I think some of that crossover too is,
you know,

1876
01:49:17.401 --> 01:49:19.140
when you,
when you realized that,
you know,

1877
01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:22.680
a police officer who's sitting next to you has some of the same challenge that

1878
01:49:22.681 --> 01:49:25.710
you have as a,
as a,
as a a,
a small business,
you know,

1879
01:49:25.711 --> 01:49:29.670
entrepreneur who has a certain problems as this guy who's the CEO of a big

1880
01:49:29.671 --> 01:49:34.140
company who has the same problems as this person who's in a start up.
So yeah,

1881
01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:35.820
who have,
by the way,

1882
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:40.740
the same problems that Lafe and I saw and experienced on the battlefield and

1883
01:49:40.741 --> 01:49:44.070
their solution.
This is the thing,
you know those problems,

1884
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:48.130
there are solutions to them.
Yeah,
they're,
they're out there.
This isn't,

1885
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.480
this isn't magic.
As a matter of fact,
I know only will bust you down here,

1886
01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:56.650
but there ain't no magic.
There's knowledge to begin.
It's like Jujitsu,
right?

1887
01:49:56.770 --> 01:50:00.050
Do Jitsu isn't about magic.
There's no magic to Jesus.
Sometimes I do say magic.

1888
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.210
It's a magical,
magical.
You do say it's a super power.
It's a super power.

1889
01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:06.730
And speaking of Jiu Jitsu,
what we're going to be trading.
So that's right.

1890
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:09.160
That's right.
Friday evening we're going to be getting home.
Boom.

1891
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:14.200
So if you come to the monster,
[inaudible] going to go Nogi for travel purposes.

1892
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:15.730
Is that cool?
Yeah.
Okay.

1893
01:50:15.731 --> 01:50:19.870
So we'll go plan the Nogi Situation Plus Echo.

1894
01:50:19.871 --> 01:50:23.080
Like do you like Nogi better?
Oh,
it goes in phases.

1895
01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.860
It's only only so you can where you're a trooper,
you're trooper barracks.
Yeah,

1896
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:33.270
sure.
Acquired.
Yeah.
Hash Hash.
Goguardian.
Yeah,

1897
01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:38.020
for sure.
So that is going to happen.
Echo.
Like I said,

1898
01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:39.070
back to my point,

1899
01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.080
Echo Charles will be there and come and see him.

1900
01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:45.820
And in the meantime Echo,

1901
01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:49.180
if somebody doesn't want to support this podcast,

1902
01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:53.590
can you let us know how to do it?
Yemen,
there's a few ways,

1903
01:50:54.210 --> 01:50:58.780
but I recommend supporting yourself.
We talked about being prepared,

1904
01:50:59.170 --> 01:51:01.180
right Leif Babin.
Um,

1905
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:05.050
so good way to prepare is to train and with training comes help,

1906
01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.350
which is supplementation.
I was one of these guys who didn't,

1907
01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:13.810
who wasn't into supplements ever.
Like,
oh,
that's like,
it's fake.

1908
01:51:13.930 --> 01:51:17.800
I don't need it,
don't need it.
And really it's kind of true.

1909
01:51:17.801 --> 01:51:22.470
You kind of don't need it.
So I thought,
but if you get the right kind of like,

1910
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:27.160
okay,
so you,
you know,
we talk about Krill oil,
supplements do matter.

1911
01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:30.600
So I'm going to talk about,
so,
so awesome.

1912
01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:35.590
Were you there when I rolled the other down?
When's the last time I saw you?

1913
01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:39.130
A couple of days ago,
I dunno.
Yeah.
Anyway,

1914
01:51:39.131 --> 01:51:41.360
I went in there like training with Chris Ruiz and he's,
he,

1915
01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:45.730
I saw you guys rolling.
Yes.
So I was there that day.
So we fished by the way.
Yeah.

1916
01:51:45.731 --> 01:51:47.940
And he goes hard.
Black belt goes hard.
Yeah.

1917
01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:52.300
And I think I did the rounds with him.
Fish.
Yeah.
Why do we call them soap fish?

1918
01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:56.910
Cause he's hard to get ahold of fish covered in soap.
You can't hold onto him.

1919
01:51:56.970 --> 01:51:58.090
Yeah.
He's like,
it's hard.

1920
01:51:58.091 --> 01:52:03.091
Slick and wirey greasy with a black belt and has the back.

1921
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:07.600
Yeah.
It's one thing to be like a,
you know,
in untrained soap fish,

1922
01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:11.980
which can be hard enough,
by the way.
Anyway,
the point is,
I go with him,

1923
01:52:11.981 --> 01:52:15.310
I did three rounds with him,
you know,
and a few more rounds with other people.

1924
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:20.050
And you know that feeling when you do a work on,
you're like,
oh,
I feel like,

1925
01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:22.030
I feel like the workouts not done.

1926
01:52:22.031 --> 01:52:27.031
I don't feel like as not like exhausted as I need to be after workout like this.

1927
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:31.650
Yeah.
So I kind of had that feeling where I'm like,
okay,
I need to do it.

1928
01:52:31.651 --> 01:52:33.610
It was like,
who can I go with like a hard,
you know,

1929
01:52:33.611 --> 01:52:37.490
I need to go like another round.
Right.
And I remember they took the shoon tech.

1930
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:42.910
You kind of forget about it cause I took,
I don't mean this in a bad way.
I don't,

1931
01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:47.780
yeah,
I don't mean this as a back handed.
There's going to be bad comment.

1932
01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:51.320
That's true.
But for everyone that doesn't quite know,

1933
01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:56.860
I don't normally see you as a guy that's going,

1934
01:52:57.650 --> 01:52:59.120
I need to get one more route.

1935
01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:07.440
A lot of times you're like,
good.
You know what that was actually not right.
Oh,

1936
01:53:07.610 --> 01:53:11.690
you're talking about the old me.
Okay.
Yeah.
Is it a praises?
This is free.

1937
01:53:11.691 --> 01:53:16.280
Shroom tech.
This is the bow with that pretty shroom tech free metcon.

1938
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:20.570
Metcon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So no,
that's not me.
You know,

1939
01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:25.240
I like that.
That is to your full credit.
Yeah.

1940
01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:29.240
You are different now.
Not just because of your skill level.
And you did it too,

1941
01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:33.500
but also because of your,
your metcon,
your endurance and all that.

1942
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:38.270
You've definitely,
you,
you used to be done.
Yeah.
So,

1943
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:41.240
and I and I talked about this before or that's a good point though,

1944
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:43.460
because one kind of plays off the other,

1945
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:44.990
especially if you don't like being tired.

1946
01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:50.360
So if you get tired early,
you're like,

1947
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:53.210
you're going to do less and you're going to try less things.
You're going to,

1948
01:53:53.211 --> 01:53:56.720
you know,
because you're kind of fighting that fight as well,
you know?

1949
01:53:56.870 --> 01:54:00.230
So when that tiredness goes away and you know how to deal with being tired and

1950
01:54:00.231 --> 01:54:04.490
you're like,
okay,
now I'm kind of free to try this.
If it fails,

1951
01:54:04.491 --> 01:54:06.980
I can try it again.
I can not,
you know,
if you're,

1952
01:54:06.981 --> 01:54:10.160
if you're not in good shape or if you,
if you buckled to being tired,

1953
01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:13.150
it's like you only have a few bullets in the clip and once you're done and

1954
01:54:13.151 --> 01:54:16.140
you're kind of like,
oh my guns worse than worthless.
No,
no.

1955
01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:20.060
The gun looks good from lifting weights and all this stuff,

1956
01:54:20.061 --> 01:54:22.010
but it's done after a few bullets.

1957
01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:25.970
But you load up the bullets and lists bullets,
right.

1958
01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.930
You can go shoot targets here anyway.
Well that's how it is.

1959
01:54:29.931 --> 01:54:34.550
I will get you since I gave you a a a negative on the old you.

1960
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:36.440
I'll say that new you got some,

1961
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:38.920
you got some goods and if you got that Jujitsu yeah.

1962
01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:42.680
Which is way better than it used to be.
Yeah.
Even even the old Echo Charles,

1963
01:54:42.681 --> 01:54:46.540
so wouldn't know when we were rolling back in the day with Terry,
our uh,

1964
01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:50.550
our mutual friend cake nuts and I hear you.
Are you always it?

1965
01:54:50.551 --> 01:54:53.150
He'd go another route in particular for us that was when he is,

1966
01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:57.420
our skill level was far below his,
oh,
he likes those around me.

1967
01:54:57.810 --> 01:55:01.820
Smashing you.
And keep in mind,
in my defense,

1968
01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:05.360
this is Jocko z evaluation than me when he's like,
you're done.
Well Yeah,

1969
01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.250
when you're rolling with Jacqueline,
you're kind of done,
you know.

1970
01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:11.830
But it's not like I was just this sack of potatoes that was just done.

1971
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:14.990
It wasn't like that.
With the white belts,
you have our full of round.

1972
01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:19.880
That's what I'm hearing is the standard that comes out of jockeys is very high.

1973
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:26.980
Understatement.
Understatement.
Not that he's wrong.
Not that he's wrong.
Listen,

1974
01:55:26.981 --> 01:55:30.800
I mean he's,
he's just full of compliments all the time.
Thank you.
This,

1975
01:55:30.801 --> 01:55:32.860
I was like,
Hey,
can I say something like this?
You know,

1976
01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:36.560
I think it was like something positive about life.
And he's like,
yeah,

1977
01:55:36.561 --> 01:55:37.910
you did say that.
And I remember it.

1978
01:55:37.911 --> 01:55:41.540
Cause it's like don't one of the four compliments you give you the last 12
years.

1979
01:55:41.541 --> 01:55:45.950
I was like,
oh,
that's cool.
Don't happen often.
Got To know them when they,

1980
01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:50.400
the it,
that is true.
And it does help.
And not in just that way though.

1981
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:53.460
Not In just the way like,
oh I can,
I'm,
I'm in better shape.
And that's good.

1982
01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:56.240
That's true.
But you just,

1983
01:55:56.370 --> 01:56:00.000
you can do Jujitsu now without that added enemy in there.

1984
01:56:00.001 --> 01:56:02.850
So you're like free to do more Jujitsu,
Jujitsu.

1985
01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:06.600
So to sum up the last 12 minutes of conversation,

1986
01:56:06.601 --> 01:56:11.160
what you're saying is yes,
on a.com/jocko.
Yeah.
You know,

1987
01:56:11.170 --> 01:56:15.410
I got into the story.
It was a good one in my opinion.
Um,

1988
01:56:16.290 --> 01:56:21.050
yeah,
no,
that day,
that's how I felt.
I felt like my work
done.

1989
01:56:21.090 --> 01:56:24.150
I was actually thinking the same thing because the other thing about Chris,

1990
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:29.270
Chris soap fish is he moves a la La is a mover and when you move,

1991
01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:33.180
even if the guy's lighter than you,
you have to move with me or you're,

1992
01:56:33.181 --> 01:56:36.050
or you're going to get,
you're going to get caught.
And so you had to move,

1993
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:38.220
you couldn't stop moving and he's gonna move all the time on you.

1994
01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:42.240
And that's why I was really impressed

1995
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:46.620
with the fact that I've trained you so well.

1996
01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:50.220
I was impressed with how you kept bringing,
you know,

1997
01:56:50.230 --> 01:56:53.390
kept you wanting to do another round.
I could see it so good on it.

1998
01:56:54.150 --> 01:56:57.570
And I did take an metcon.
The thing is,
you forget,

1999
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:03.290
I took it like,
like an hour before I even,
uh,

2000
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:06.120
well I guess it was about an hour before it actually was rolling,

2001
01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.420
but it was like maybe half hour for I left.
I kind of forgot.

2002
01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:12.990
I'll tell you in this whole idea of shroom tech and what's the other one?

2003
01:57:12.991 --> 01:57:17.991
Performance total strength or it's like a or the strawberry banana that,

2004
01:57:19.410 --> 01:57:22.870
so if that's considered cheating that I've been changing a lot lately because

2005
01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:27.540
I'm rolling in man.
A lot of times I've already worked out in the day,

2006
01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:29.520
I've been up all day.
I went sir,

2007
01:57:29.521 --> 01:57:33.630
I've done a bunch of stuff so it's not like I'm rolling in to the gym or to

2008
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:38.430
train the Jujitsu being all fresh.
I haven't been getting a massage all day.
No,

2009
01:57:38.431 --> 01:57:40.140
I've been back to grinding it out all day.

2010
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:45.350
And so sometimes I need to get on soil rich and so going to call it good.

2011
01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:49.140
This is really why I say it's cheating because I'm always saying it while I'm

2012
01:57:49.141 --> 01:57:53.160
looking at you and it's cheating if it's like me against you,
who's,
you know,

2013
01:57:53.161 --> 01:57:57.660
who's the better warrior kind of thing and so all but you're on shroom tech.

2014
01:57:57.661 --> 01:58:01.290
Okay.
So you have a little help then still let you know.
But no,

2015
01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:05.330
if you're training and you want to learn Jujitsu or you want to,
you know,

2016
01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:07.950
push performance so you,
cause that's how you get gains.

2017
01:58:07.951 --> 01:58:12.951
You recover from exercise and you want to push the exercise and you want to in

2018
01:58:13.081 --> 01:58:17.130
Jujitsu situation where you want to train,
be able to train longer without,

2019
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:17.620
you know,

2020
01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:20.520
the burden of this fatigue where you might have to quit at a certain time or

2021
01:58:20.521 --> 01:58:25.110
whatever.
Don't have to quit.
No.
Well,
you know what I mean?
You don't have to quit.

2022
01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:26.700
It is helpful.

2023
01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:31.700
This shroom tech is at some point when he get Rhabdo and you start pissing,

2024
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:36.060
you got take some recovery.
All right,

2025
01:58:36.090 --> 01:58:39.930
this is my nonverbal signal for let's move to the next side and when I do this,

2026
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:43.900
yeah,
no,
but there's still a lot to be said though.
That's the thing.
See,

2027
01:58:43.901 --> 01:58:47.950
and I think that's really the value of this whole thing is that this needs to be

2028
01:58:47.951 --> 01:58:52.070
talked about.
If I knew this,
like back in the,
you know

2029
01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:56.500
that guy that you were talking about,
that echo that you were talking about,

2030
01:58:56.501 --> 01:58:59.170
if I knew this kind of stuff,
yeah,

2031
01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:02.710
I would have spent very little time at [inaudible].
Do you hold that against me?

2032
01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:06.970
Because I could have told you about this stuff earlier.
No,
I don't,
man.
You know,

2033
01:59:06.971 --> 01:59:11.820
that's life.
Maybe I was afraid to anyway.
No,
I wasn't late.

2034
01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:14.710
I don't know if you're unsure the shroom tech or whatever.
Krill oil.

2035
01:59:14.711 --> 01:59:16.950
That's a big one.
I haven't tried shrimp shy,
but uh,

2036
01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:21.300
I just got a new order of acryloid actually from audit.
Just pull that I got.

2037
01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:24.580
I got some strong bone as well.
Yeah,
well that's good.
Yeah,

2038
01:59:24.581 --> 01:59:27.580
those are good because they keep you in like you can.
Yeah,

2039
01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:31.270
I do like super deep squats and I had knee surgery full on ACL,

2040
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:35.560
like all this stuff.
Deep,
deep squats all the way.
No problem,
no factor.
Krill oil,

2041
01:59:35.561 --> 01:59:38.650
just boom.
Taking it through.
Nonetheless,

2042
01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:41.590
if you guys like these types of supplements,

2043
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:46.150
go to [inaudible] dot com slash Josh if you want 10% off,

2044
01:59:46.151 --> 01:59:50.350

Get Yourself,
keep yourself in the game.

2045
01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:53.650
Also,
good way to support Amazon.
If you shop Amazon,

2046
01:59:54.850 --> 01:59:56.230
click through our website,
Jocko,

2047
01:59:56.231 --> 01:59:58.900
podcast.com this little Amazon banner there on the site.

2048
01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:01.210
It's actually in the menu to now you just,
you know,

2049
02:00:01.211 --> 02:00:04.030
in the top navigation menu is what you call it.

2050
02:00:05.410 --> 02:00:08.110
Click on there before you do your shopping,
whatever you're buying,

2051
02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.890
whether it be these books or whatever,
you know,
do it like that.

2052
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:16.950
You can support small,
teeny,
tiny action,
great support.
Boom.

2053
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:20.560
Another way of course,
is to subscribe.

2054
02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:25.000
If you're on iTunes or any of these other podcasting platforms,

2055
02:00:25.630 --> 02:00:29.230
whatever they may be,
stitcher,
Google,
play,
all these ones.
There's other ones too,

2056
02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:33.120
but I'm just saying some subscribe.
That's the point.
You know,
um,

2057
02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:35.050
even though you probably have already,
so

2058
02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:39.760
also youtube videos,
more videos.

2059
02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:44.090
I think I'm going to release one tomorrow.
Oh,
corn,

2060
02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:47.800
little fun one by tomorrow or you mean tomorrow from today?
Yeah.

2061
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:49.840
So it already been released.

2062
02:00:51.490 --> 02:00:54.130
Maybe I might not blow unpredictable.
You know,

2063
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:59.170
we call that variable reward system that I'm delivering right now anyway.

2064
02:00:59.250 --> 02:01:01.740
Um,
youtube channel.
We have some videos on there.
Uh,

2065
02:01:02.770 --> 02:01:05.550
if you'd like the video version of the podcast or you like these other like

2066
02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:10.120
chunks of lessons or whatever that Taco talks about,
um,
subscribe.

2067
02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.920
You'll get a little notification when they come up.

2068
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:16.420
Want to upload them if you want it,
if you want.
Yeah,
of course.
People don't,

2069
02:01:16.421 --> 02:01:18.340
don't like to get notified.
Yeah.

2070
02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:23.460
I actually stopped to notify because sometimes such a long period of time comes

2071
02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:28.690
between when a video comes out from you.
Yeah.
It was like that before.
I know,
man,

2072
02:01:28.691 --> 02:01:30.670
that was,
those were hard times,
you know,

2073
02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:34.240
it's not like there's no way I could ever possibly know unless I got that little

2074
02:01:34.241 --> 02:01:38.530
notification that says Jocko podcasts is just uploaded a video and I'm rejoice.

2075
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:42.710
Yeah.
You kind forget about it really.
But yeah,

2076
02:01:42.711 --> 02:01:46.790
no I did turn off the notifications for that one because it'll go off right when

2077
02:01:46.791 --> 02:01:50.180
I finish uploading.
So I already know when they're uploaded.
Seems Sane.

2078
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:55.760
I do see what you're saying.
Sensitive to sounds cool.
Um,

2079
02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:57.260
the not the last way,

2080
02:01:57.261 --> 02:02:01.910
but another way is if you wear tee shirts and you want to represent who doesn't

2081
02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:05.510
wear tee shirts,
not me.
I want to teach.
That's it.

2082
02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:10.250
That's my whole uniform t shirt.
Boom.
Um,
but yeah,

2083
02:02:10.251 --> 02:02:12.710
if you like t shirts you want to represent in this way.
Boom.

2084
02:02:12.711 --> 02:02:16.160
Jocko podcast shirts,
multiple types of shirts,

2085
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:19.010
a rash guards as well for the Nogi situation.

2086
02:02:19.130 --> 02:02:23.930
Jujitsu or like anything where you need range of motion,
like running,

2087
02:02:23.931 --> 02:02:26.270
cycling,
crossfit,
all this stuff anyway,
they're good.

2088
02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:31.040
May or may not give you 19% improvement in all performance.

2089
02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:36.510
Why are you saying may not?
I think that's like,
um,

2090
02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:40.080
the scientifically literate way to put it.
Nobody,
there's,
it's,

2091
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:42.830
it's actually will because there's no one that said,
hey,

2092
02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:47.750
I didn't get the 19% out of this gig.
Yeah.
I think,
yeah,
actually Jaeger,
right.

2093
02:02:47.751 --> 02:02:51.170
There you go.
Boom.
18.7%.
Yeah.
You know,

2094
02:02:51.171 --> 02:02:53.690
you get one of these slackers that maybe,
you know,

2095
02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:56.390
I don't know if you have the rash guard,
you're probably not a slacker.

2096
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:59.750
So I guess that's invalid as well.
Um,
but yeah.
Anyway,
Jocko,

2097
02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:04.520
store.com that's where he can get all the,
you know,
rash guards and cool shirts.

2098
02:03:04.521 --> 02:03:06.410
I think they're cool.
We made a,

2099
02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:10.220
we went through great lengths to get the good shirts,

2100
02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:14.510
like good quality.
One guy emailed me,

2101
02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:15.690
actually not one guy does.

2102
02:03:15.691 --> 02:03:19.640
I had got another recent email said it's my favorite shirt to wear because of

2103
02:03:19.641 --> 02:03:21.800
how it fits and it cause it's good,
you know,

2104
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:24.410
it's not like a give away free shirt.
You get,

2105
02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:27.230
you know when you go to the soccer game and wherever you go,

2106
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:29.800
you know they're cool.
Check them out if you like them,

2107
02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:34.370
support that way and get one and represent and psychological warfare.
Okay,

2108
02:03:34.371 --> 02:03:36.200
so I'm going to go into psychological warfare.

2109
02:03:36.201 --> 02:03:37.610
If you don't know psychological warfare,

2110
02:03:37.611 --> 02:03:40.670
if you're at a moment of weakness in your diet,
workout,
uh,

2111
02:03:40.671 --> 02:03:42.530
waking up in the morning,
he needed a little boost,

2112
02:03:42.531 --> 02:03:46.430
a little like someone there to sort of gently spot you,

2113
02:03:46.431 --> 02:03:50.600
help you through these moments of weakness.
You go on Itunes,

2114
02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:53.900
maybe Amazon music,
wherever you can buy mp3s,

2115
02:03:55.190 --> 02:03:59.780
get psychological warfare,
Jocko Willink,
little tracks.

2116
02:03:59.781 --> 02:04:00.201
He can listen.

2117
02:04:00.201 --> 02:04:03.740
You can put it as your alarm if you want or just listen to the whatever track

2118
02:04:03.741 --> 02:04:06.560
you need and he'll get you through it.
I'm telling you,
here's the thing.

2119
02:04:06.770 --> 02:04:10.380
So yes,
day before yesterday,
not yesterday.
Yes,

2120
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:14.120
the day before yesterday I was about to work out,
felt like working out,
rested,

2121
02:04:14.121 --> 02:04:18.200
boom,
you know,
took my pre workout stuff ready.
I was like,
all right,

2122
02:04:18.201 --> 02:04:21.350
I'm going to die.
All listen to psychological warfare at my moment of strength.

2123
02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:25.070
Has this ever been tried before?
I don't know.
That's the thing.

2124
02:04:25.071 --> 02:04:28.520
That's what I was thinking at the time,
Bro.
It's kind of like abuse.

2125
02:04:28.521 --> 02:04:32.240
You know how like,
you know how like you're,
you drink coffee or something.

2126
02:04:32.241 --> 02:04:34.340
He's like,
fuck,
I'm kinda tired.
I'm gonna drink some coffee.

2127
02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:37.620
And when you're not tying to drink it,
it's like I'm buzzing off the,

2128
02:04:37.630 --> 02:04:38.070
and you have that

2129
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:42.450
<v 0>good feeling now.
You're like double coffeed up,
ready to get after it.</v>

2130
02:04:42.451 --> 02:04:43.284
That's how you feel.

2131
02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:48.060
It's like I'm abusing the psychological work only for moments of weakness,

2132
02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:51.240
for moments of triumph is what it is.
That's it.

2133
02:04:51.241 --> 02:04:54.780
Not even so even if you're feeling weak and you want a moment of triumph,

2134
02:04:54.810 --> 02:04:57.830
that's what it is.
It's what,
how was the workout is the question.

2135
02:04:57.860 --> 02:05:01.110
Workout was dope.
Of course.
It was double check me out,
Bro.

2136
02:05:02.370 --> 02:05:07.050
Pumps still on anyway.
Good.
Um,

2137
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:10.230
you know while you're clicking through Amazon,
by the way,

2138
02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:14.580
you can get on amazon.com you can get Jocko white tea.

2139
02:05:14.581 --> 02:05:17.910
Now there's other reports have come in and this report,

2140
02:05:17.911 --> 02:05:21.570
what I found interesting because this is a side effect apparently of the t of

2141
02:05:21.571 --> 02:05:23.820
the tea and that is any,

2142
02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:26.610
this could be a positive side effect or it could be a negative side effect

2143
02:05:26.730 --> 02:05:27.630
depending on who you are.

2144
02:05:27.630 --> 02:05:32.630
But one guy reported that he drank some tea at night and he had 1.5 inches of

2145
02:05:33.091 --> 02:05:34.530
beard growth overnight.

2146
02:05:35.490 --> 02:05:38.790
So if you want that to prison it could be positive,
could be negative.

2147
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:43.620
And also we had a police officer out there and,
and again this is just,

2148
02:05:43.621 --> 02:05:48.480
I'm just giving some new,
some new testament testimonies that have come in.

2149
02:05:48.810 --> 02:05:51.360
This one,
um,
one police officer,

2150
02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:55.140
he's shooting the El Presidente Day drove,

2151
02:05:55.141 --> 02:05:58.200
which is a drill where you have two targets and you sh two rounds in each target

2152
02:05:58.201 --> 02:06:03.030
and you'd do a reload and his time has decreased,
which is an improvement,

2153
02:06:03.031 --> 02:06:05.340
right?
So he stopped being able to do this faster,

2154
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:09.630
31% which I think is really good.
Especially numbers.
Yep.

2155
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:11.160
This is a critical situation,
right?

2156
02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:13.530
You've got two bad guys and then you got to do a reload.

2157
02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:17.940
You might want to have some Jocko white tea that's almost double the 19% yeah,

2158
02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:19.410
it's good.
And Yeah,

2159
02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:23.100
and the thing is that I want to make sure everybody understands is that this

2160
02:06:23.130 --> 02:06:28.130
isn't like conjecture and some pseudo science that I'm talking about here.

2161
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:32.310
This is 147% factual,

2162
02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:36.270
so everyone should know that.
So order the tea that Jack White Tea.

2163
02:06:37.650 --> 02:06:40.590
Also you can order a new book,

2164
02:06:41.070 --> 02:06:42.900
which is called way of the warrior kid.

2165
02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:48.140
And I got asked why I wrote this the other day and one of the things that

2166
02:06:49.741 --> 02:06:54.390
propelled me to write this book was I was looking for book when my son was a

2167
02:06:54.391 --> 02:06:58.770
little younger.
I was looking for a buck for a boy to read.
It's got a book.

2168
02:06:58.860 --> 02:06:59.431
And so,
you know,

2169
02:06:59.431 --> 02:07:03.570
I wanted him to read kind of a right kind of a book about getting after it,

2170
02:07:03.690 --> 02:07:04.523
right?

2171
02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:07.710
So I went out and I looked through a couple of books and I finally found this

2172
02:07:07.711 --> 02:07:10.200
pirate book and I got cool pirate book.
I didn't pay too much attention.

2173
02:07:10.201 --> 02:07:12.450
I didn't like look through it because it's a pirate book,
right?

2174
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:14.550
Pirates are swords,

2175
02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:19.800
ships taking over,
right.

2176
02:07:20.250 --> 02:07:23.220
Storming vessels.
All good.
See,

2177
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:27.300
so go into the book,
I break,
bring it home to my son,

2178
02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:30.960
we start reading the book and um,
they were weak.

2179
02:07:31.290 --> 02:07:33.570
And so now I'm like trying to get my son,
you know,

2180
02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:38.020
partner and opening in game and he's reading about weak pirates.
They weren't,

2181
02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:40.830
they didn't even attack anybody can do it.

2182
02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:46.040
So I realized that there's a dearth of books for children,

2183
02:07:46.121 --> 02:07:46.870
not just boys,

2184
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:51.870
but boys and girls that will show someone how to get after it at a young age.

2185
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:54.640
Right.
Which,
and you can start getting after it at birth.
By the way,

2186
02:07:54.641 --> 02:07:59.200
there's no reason to wait.
There's no legal minimum age.
You have to be 18.
Oh,

2187
02:07:59.201 --> 02:08:01.840
can I see your kid again after it license?
You're get after it.
Id Card.
No,

2188
02:08:01.841 --> 02:08:03.760
you can start getting at after at birth.

2189
02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:09.660
So that's one of the reasons that I wrote a book about a kid who's not going to

2190
02:08:12.431 --> 02:08:15.670
be a pansy and not going to be wimpy.
He actually is in the beginning,

2191
02:08:16.690 --> 02:08:19.570
he's feeling pretty weak.
You know how many pull ups you can do?

2192
02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:25.510
How many zero pull ups?
It's not good.
You know,
you know what he's,

2193
02:08:25.630 --> 02:08:29.890
you know,
you know well,
he knows his times tables,
how well he doesn't know him,

2194
02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:35.170
but know his times tables.
That's weak,
I guess.

2195
02:08:35.171 --> 02:08:40.060
What can he swim?
No,
can't swim.
And last thing,
is he getting picked on?

2196
02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:44.350
Yeah.
Kenny Williamson,
Jenny Williamson,
the bully.

2197
02:08:44.351 --> 02:08:47.830
He's all up on him,
pushing him around.
He can't stand up to him.

2198
02:08:47.831 --> 02:08:52.030
Doesn't know what to do.
So is that a good way to go through life?
I don't know.

2199
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:56.060
You tell me.
Zero poems.
Do you want to be able to do zero pulps echo?
No.
No,

2200
02:08:56.070 --> 02:08:58.900
not good.
You gotta be able to do some pull ups.
So

2201
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:03.490
that's why I wrote the book so that the kid out there,

2202
02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:06.670
they can't do any pull ups.
Maybe he's getting picked on.
Maybe,

2203
02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:09.850
maybe he can't swim,
but maybe there's some other thing in his life that he,

2204
02:09:10.070 --> 02:09:13.050
we all got issues.
You know,
we all got something we got to overcome.
Right?

2205
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:14.860
We all got feared.
Overcome.
Guess what?

2206
02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:17.860
We talk about fear in the book cause everyone's life was talking about today.

2207
02:09:17.890 --> 02:09:20.080
We all got afraid.
How you can overcome that.
It's true.

2208
02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:23.860
Well luckily for mark in the book,
his uncle Jake shows up,

2209
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:29.350
uncle Jake was in the seal teams and he's got some lessons to teach to young

2210
02:09:29.351 --> 02:09:30.520
mark and that's what he does.

2211
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:34.690
So you can preorder it right now way of the warrior kid.

2212
02:09:35.890 --> 02:09:39.880
And you know,
we gotta make some tee shirts on that one.
Yeah.
Oh,
kids tee shirts.

2213
02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:40.840
Yeah.

2214
02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:45.460
The few parts that you did tell me it's even you explaining like that's a good

2215
02:09:45.461 --> 02:09:47.740
little explanation of it and it's good.

2216
02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:53.050
But the little parts that you were telling me were,
were kind of impressive.

2217
02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:56.830
Like there is,
that's kind of advanced for a kid's book even,
you know,

2218
02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:59.410
in a good way.
Meaning like it's not,
you know,

2219
02:09:59.411 --> 02:10:01.360
there's certain obvious things that you,
you,

2220
02:10:01.361 --> 02:10:04.750
you know you're going to find any kid's book,
right?
Even with stories like this,

2221
02:10:04.751 --> 02:10:08.320
it's like,
okay,
I know the narrative,
I get it.
We'd hand it has to be that way to,

2222
02:10:08.321 --> 02:10:10.180
you know,
to teach the lesson effect of all this stuff.

2223
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:15.280
But the little hints of complexity there were impressive.

2224
02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:19.120
I got to say the other thing that is,
or even when I read it right now,

2225
02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:22.600
just finished finalists edits and you're like,

2226
02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:29.230
there's so much in there that's actually from the podcast,
but it's for a kid,

2227
02:10:29.231 --> 02:10:34.160
it's putting the kids language,
uncle Jake's breaking it down real.
So that's why,

2228
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:37.760
that's why I don't care who you are.
You,
you walked her broken down.

2229
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:41.120
That's a law combat and the book extreme ownership written by Leif Babin and

2230
02:10:41.121 --> 02:10:44.180
myself.
Got to keep things simple.
So it's in a simple way.

2231
02:10:44.181 --> 02:10:46.760
So that's where the warrior kid,

2232
02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:50.180
and also by the way just released another book.

2233
02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:56.630
It's called discipline equals freedom field manual.
And this is the,

2234
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:59.680
this is the ebook that I talked about here in a long time ago.

2235
02:10:59.681 --> 02:11:02.210
I'm gonna write an Ebook,
right?
Well,

2236
02:11:02.211 --> 02:11:06.920
it turned into a real book and it's broken into two parts.

2237
02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:09.020
One part is called FOBTs.

2238
02:11:09.630 --> 02:11:10.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2239
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.590
<v 0>The other part is called actions.</v>

2240
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:15.700
These are actually my thoughts and my actions.

2241
02:11:15.701 --> 02:11:17.940
So what are thoughts?
Well,

2242
02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:20.350
what I think about what's going on and what I think about when you run up

2243
02:11:20.351 --> 02:11:24.130
against weakness,
what do you think those were?
The thoughts and the actions is,

2244
02:11:24.131 --> 02:11:27.610
okay,
how do you act?
Which means workouts are in there,

2245
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:32.470
which means talks about martial arts,
talks about what I eat,
how I sleep.

2246
02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:33.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2247
02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:37.810
<v 0>And that kind of stuff.
So
preorder it,</v>

2248
02:11:38.770 --> 02:11:39.603
check it out.

2249
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:40.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2250
02:11:40.570 --> 02:11:45.100
<v 0>And it will help them logistically when the book comes out.</v>

2251
02:11:45.101 --> 02:11:46.720
Because see the publishers,

2252
02:11:48.970 --> 02:11:51.760
they don't understand what we're doing here.

2253
02:11:52.690 --> 02:11:55.450
They don't know what we're doing here.
They don't know what I'm talking about.

2254
02:11:55.451 --> 02:11:59.680
We are not talking about you.
I'm not talking about we,
I'm talking about,
Oh yeah,

2255
02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:02.020
yeah.
They understand what we're doing here.

2256
02:12:02.230 --> 02:12:06.170
They understand that there's troopers.
I want to get after it.
Nope.

2257
02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:09.310
So when they don't understand that,
they're like,
okay,
well,
you know,

2258
02:12:09.311 --> 02:12:10.290
I guess we'll print,
I don't know.

2259
02:12:10.570 --> 02:12:13.850
I guess we'll print 400 copies of this and that way,
you know,
again,

2260
02:12:14.150 --> 02:12:17.170
somebody can buy yet.
Right.
But they don't know.
Emilia is good.

2261
02:12:17.171 --> 02:12:19.240
They don't know what they're talking about.
Yeah.
So

2262
02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:24.520
preorder so that they understand what we are doing here.

2263
02:12:24.521 --> 02:12:27.880
Maybe we'll get some of them in the game actually.
Okay.
So that's that.

2264
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:31.570
And you don't,
speaking of books,

2265
02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:36.100
leaf hours,
talk about a little book called extreme ownership.

2266
02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:41.410
What are you hearing from the field on extreme ownership right now?

2267
02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:44.410
The book that we wrote,
I'm a,

2268
02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:46.950
I'm hearing a lot from the field on a straight line or show me what,
what's,

2269
02:12:46.951 --> 02:12:47.540
what's awesome?

2270
02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:51.730
The about extreme ownership is just continues to resonate with people,
you know,

2271
02:12:51.731 --> 02:12:55.810
and uh,
even,
you know,
we're,
we're over a year and a half out of publication now.

2272
02:12:56.130 --> 02:12:58.810
Um,
and that this thing continues to be in the top.

2273
02:12:59.070 --> 02:13:02.680
You're hotter and 50 or 200 on,
on Amazon.
Uh,

2274
02:13:02.681 --> 02:13:04.700
and so much of that as word of mouth driven,
you know,

2275
02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:08.070
that people are buying that for their team,
you know,
and holding,
Whoa,

2276
02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:08.680
wait a minute,

2277
02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.470
what will did it help with that big ad that we put in the New York Times?

2278
02:13:11.590 --> 02:13:15.250
Did that help sell it?
Oh wait,
no,
we didn't do that.
Oh,

2279
02:13:15.251 --> 02:13:18.460
maybe it's the TV spots that we did.
Oh No,
we didn't do that either.

2280
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:22.360
So word of mouth.
It is.
Exactly.
And I,
you know,
for that,

2281
02:13:22.361 --> 02:13:26.080
that's the real testament I think for,
you know,
uh,
for me that,
uh,

2282
02:13:26.081 --> 02:13:29.140
that we wrote a book as resin with leaders that's helping them get better,

2283
02:13:29.141 --> 02:13:32.130
to lead better teams,
for people to be better

2284
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.860
<v 2>teammates and employ these concepts and extreme ownership,
you know,</v>

2285
02:13:34.861 --> 02:13:37.140
and when we see them,
uh,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

2286
02:13:37.141 --> 02:13:40.440
the fire service training that's going on,
you know,
and,

2287
02:13:40.441 --> 02:13:42.500
and fight firefighters are using that as their,

2288
02:13:42.650 --> 02:13:46.200
their training manual conducting these,
these training.
We see police,
uh,

2289
02:13:46.230 --> 02:13:49.350
police units doing it.
We see,
uh,
businesses,
you know,

2290
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:51.420
and some of them bring us in and have training someone,

2291
02:13:51.421 --> 02:13:54.300
they're holding their own training and they're buying that book and they're,
uh,

2292
02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:57.690
they're,
they're learning out of it.
Uh,
I was working with the business just a,

2293
02:13:58.010 --> 02:14:01.380
just a couple of weeks back where they,
you know,
each,
each group in this,

2294
02:14:01.570 --> 02:14:06.000
the leadership team was assigned to study a chapter and talk about how,

2295
02:14:06.001 --> 02:14:07.950
what in that chapter applies to them.
And they're,
they're,

2296
02:14:07.951 --> 02:14:08.940
they're learning out of that.

2297
02:14:08.941 --> 02:14:12.550
And it's inspiring to see that stuff because not only is it,
is it,
you know,

2298
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:14.610
does it say,
Hey,
we wrote a book as having some impact.

2299
02:14:14.610 --> 02:14:16.560
But when you see the things that they're doing,

2300
02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:18.210
when they're implement extreme ownership,

2301
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:21.430
when they're using cover move and they're not focused on themselves but about

2302
02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:24.860
the mission and working together as a team and use in decent vice commander,

2303
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:28.620
you know,
explaining the why to their teams,
um,
and,

2304
02:14:28.621 --> 02:14:32.910
and the results are amazing,
you know,
see that happen.
And,
uh,
and that's really,

2305
02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:33.840
uh,
you know,

2306
02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:37.110
that's really what it's all about for us I think is seeing that kind of impact.

2307
02:14:37.111 --> 02:14:40.350
So,
uh,
it's been awesome to see that.
Um,
and uh,

2308
02:14:40.650 --> 02:14:42.810
looking forward for that to continue to,

2309
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:46.770
to grow and expand its reach across the globe.
You know,
we,

2310
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:50.100
we talk about in the book we talk about working with Iraqi soldiers and one of

2311
02:14:50.101 --> 02:14:51.330
the hardest things,

2312
02:14:51.390 --> 02:14:56.390
obviously even if you took a great soldier but they don't speak the language you

2313
02:14:56.431 --> 02:14:58.350
speak and you have a language barrier,
that's a real problem.

2314
02:14:58.350 --> 02:15:01.590
So a lot of times in these teams,
what the book gives them,

2315
02:15:01.591 --> 02:15:05.520
what the extreme ownership gives them,
it gives them a,
a language,

2316
02:15:05.521 --> 02:15:08.580
a common language to talk about the issues that the leadership problems that

2317
02:15:08.581 --> 02:15:09.210
they're having.

2318
02:15:09.210 --> 02:15:12.140
They can identify it because how can you fight an enemy that you can identify?

2319
02:15:12.450 --> 02:15:16.950
So if,
you know,
if you don't know that,
hey,
our decentralized command is weak,

2320
02:15:16.970 --> 02:15:20.490
and if you don't know what that is and you can't identify it,
how can you fix it?

2321
02:15:20.610 --> 02:15:23.730
If you got a cover move to solve problems and work together.

2322
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:26.280
But you don't know what that looks like or you don't even know what to call it.

2323
02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:28.020
How are you going to get it solved?

2324
02:15:28.350 --> 02:15:31.860
So that's one of the things that I noticed when we show up at a company that

2325
02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:35.760
already is,
is using it and have read it.

2326
02:15:35.970 --> 02:15:39.540
They're immediately saying,
you know,
hey,
this is this,
this situation we got.

2327
02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.640
We got these divisions over here in this division over here and we're not

2328
02:15:41.641 --> 02:15:44.730
covering moving for each other.
We got to identify and you go,
okay,

2329
02:15:44.731 --> 02:15:48.090
so they've already got a grip on it.
When people that we go and talk to,

2330
02:15:48.110 --> 02:15:52.170
they haven't read the book yet,
they can't even really identify what's wrong.

2331
02:15:52.171 --> 02:15:55.710
They just don't see it.
They don't have the,
the ability,

2332
02:15:55.711 --> 02:15:59.220
it's like not having night vision.
They just,
they just don't see it.
So the book,

2333
02:15:59.221 --> 02:16:02.130
when you get that book out there to everyone on her team and all of a sudden

2334
02:16:02.131 --> 02:16:05.850
they all have that common language,
they all can identify targets.

2335
02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:10.250
They know what the bad guys look like and they know how to fix it.
And that's,

2336
02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:12.090
that's what I noticed.
That's awesome.

2337
02:16:12.091 --> 02:16:14.160
About when we work with these companies and they're,

2338
02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:17.030
and they're in the game big time.
And then the,

2339

2340

Go to extreme ownership.com sign up.
Now,
like I said before,

2341
02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:26.820
I think this thing is probably going to sell out.
So if you want tickets,

2342
02:16:26.821 --> 02:16:30.160
if you want to be there,
if you want to be a part of this bad

2343
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:34.570
<v 0>ass event that we just,
we were talking about just this amazing group of people,</v>

2344
02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:39.430
of leaders and aspiring leaders to get in the game.
Sign up now,

2345
02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:44.470
extreme ownership.com I will not get you doing a speech for the record.

2346
02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:48.190
Just so you know,
everyone echo doesn't think he's going to give a speech.

2347
02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:51.970
We think he probably should.
How about a side speech?

2348
02:16:52.930 --> 02:16:56.170
Most speech all the time and site speed echo was,

2349
02:16:56.600 --> 02:16:59.270
equity is a very laid back,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

2350
02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:02.530
the good island add to when we put them up on stage for the muster.

2351
02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:07.510
He was not happy about that
and that was just to say thanks.
Yeah,

2352
02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:11.750
you went in your shell.
Nah,
man,
I got it.
You're welcome.
Hey,
you know,

2353
02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:15.310
on with the show.
So you know what we were talking about,

2354
02:17:15.311 --> 02:17:16.720
you got to focus on your weaknesses,
right?

2355
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:20.290
So I think you need to present at least for a couple of hours on the stage.

2356
02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:23.260
So I got to talk about this one thing because it just happened again.

2357
02:17:23.261 --> 02:17:27.250
So the echoes got this thing where he goes into this alternate voice at the end

2358
02:17:27.251 --> 02:17:28.510
of some sentences.

2359
02:17:28.630 --> 02:17:32.290
And I noticed in one of the last podcast that I actually started doing it too.

2360
02:17:32.291 --> 02:17:34.870
So everyone has been saying,
Hey Jocko,
would have you gotten from echo?

2361
02:17:35.290 --> 02:17:38.620
Well I think the one thing that I could say I definitely got from echo is doing

2362
02:17:38.621 --> 02:17:42.310
this thing right here because that's what he did and he just did it.

2363
02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:45.520
He just did it.
So pay attention to that.
I don't know.
I knew what I call that.

2364
02:17:45.730 --> 02:17:49.120
I'm going to call that the echo voice escalation.

2365
02:17:49.690 --> 02:17:52.750
So you just talking normal and then all of a sudden you go into that echo voice

2366
02:17:52.751 --> 02:17:56.200
actually escalation so that you've got your own thing.
Now it's effective.

2367
02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:59.560
It's effective.
See how you do that.
That one,

2368
02:17:59.650 --> 02:18:03.940
that one a before the monster,
until the muster.

2369
02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:05.310
If you want to,
uh,

2370
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:09.370
give us feedbacks or comments or whatever you want to continue this
conversation,

2371
02:18:09.730 --> 02:18:10.070
you,

2372
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:15.070
you can actually find us not hard to find and find us all of the interwebs,

2373
02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:20.650
uh,
Twitter,
Instagram,
me,

2374
02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:26.090
and of course,
of course you want to find us on that pace.

2375
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:27.490
[inaudible] Paul,

2376
02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:32.520
how are we going to be that I one Lafe is at Leif Babin Echo is at Echo Charles

2377
02:18:37.330 --> 02:18:40.030
and I am at Jocko Willink.
Echo,

2378
02:18:41.350 --> 02:18:45.520
do you have anything else to add right now?
Oh Man.
Oh yeah.
Actually I do.

2379
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:50.260
And I heard you mentioned this before,
where you're talking about in Ramadi,

2380
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:54.790
where you know,
the sun comes up and you see,
you hear the call to prayer.

2381
02:18:55.090 --> 02:18:58.180
I know what that is,
but what,
what did,
like,
what does that sound like?

2382
02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:03.040
What does the call to prayer,
you know,
what is it a person like on a,

2383
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:05.580
it is a person.
It's a person or on loudspeaker,
right?

2384
02:19:05.581 --> 02:19:08.530
So each mosque has a minaret,
which is a tower,

2385
02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:13.390
and they generally have a loudspeaker.
And,
uh,
and so you've got to,

2386
02:19:13.391 --> 02:19:17.530
I forget what the title is.
And then,
um,
in the Islamic world,
there's that,

2387
02:19:17.531 --> 02:19:21.550
there's a specific title for the prayer call or that's going to get up and sing,

2388
02:19:21.551 --> 02:19:23.710
sing this prayer.
Um,
but yeah,

2389
02:19:23.711 --> 02:19:26.720
you just hear these speakers going off all over the city and it's like a chant

2390
02:19:26.721 --> 02:19:31.190
to kind of,
did they sing sing?
It's a song.

2391
02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:34.920
It's a,
so it's so many that,
you know,
when you hear that,
you know,
like the sea,

2392
02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:39.170
so there'll be one early in the morning before the sun comes up and we had to be

2393
02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:41.360
in place,
you know,
you're going,
you're going into enemy territory.

2394
02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:44.330
You had to be in the building,
locked out,
ready to go,

2395
02:19:44.331 --> 02:19:45.860
because as soon as the call to prayer goes down,

2396
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:48.890
you know that the city is going to start awakening,
drink,

2397
02:19:48.891 --> 02:19:49.850
we're going to start off,
you know,

2398
02:19:49.851 --> 02:19:53.160
coming out of their houses and cars starting up and people moving around and,

2399
02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:56.990
and the sun's going to come up pretty soon.
Um,
and so,
yeah,
there's,
there's,

2400
02:19:57.020 --> 02:20:01.010
there's five of those throughout the day.
Um,
and uh,
you know,
that would be the,

2401
02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:05.090
you have to hear that that morning called the prayer was like we're going to get

2402
02:20:05.091 --> 02:20:06.710
some can the enemy,

2403
02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:10.610
the enemy in Ramadi for the most part didn't operate at nighttime because we had

2404
02:20:10.611 --> 02:20:12.830
all the advantages of night vision and everything else.

2405
02:20:12.831 --> 02:20:14.390
So they operated during the day.

2406
02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:18.400
So the indicator that the day was starting as the first morning call to prayer

2407
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:22.010
and when you'd hear it,
man,
that's so crazy how it's like,

2408
02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:24.860
it's like this official beginning of the day,
you know,

2409
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:29.720
call that's like the official commencement of the day.

2410
02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:32.510
Isn't that crazy?
I guess you would think it's crazy.

2411
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:36.020
I mean we have that individually,
you know,
your alarm clock or your whatever.

2412
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:37.880
But like for everybody,

2413
02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:43.920
that's one of the things that makes it so,
so crazy is that it's,

2414
02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:48.380
it is the whole city every day,
you know,
cause like one,
actually this was funny,

2415
02:20:48.381 --> 02:20:49.370
at one point they said,
hey,

2416
02:20:49.371 --> 02:20:51.830
you weren't allowed then the would they say we weren't allowed to go within a

2417
02:20:51.831 --> 02:20:53.780
block of,
of,
of a mosque or something like that.

2418
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:58.520
And there's so many mosques in Ramadi.
We just showed them a map and we're like,

2419
02:20:58.521 --> 02:21:00.650
okay,
so you don't want us to do anything.

2420
02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:02.900
Cause if we can't go within two blocks of a mosque or whatever,

2421
02:21:02.901 --> 02:21:04.900
the rule that they tried to throw at us,
you know,
I said,

2422
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:08.120
so you don't want us to do anything else on this deployment because here's a

2423
02:21:08.121 --> 02:21:11.630
mosque,
here's a mosque,
here's a mosque,
here's a mosque.
And by the way,

2424
02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:15.380
Intel says this mosque is okay.
Local mosque until says this one's bad,

2425
02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:20.280
this one's bad,
this one's good.
So we had,
you know,
different,
different,
um,

2426
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:23.900
you know,
because just because someone's,
the mosque,
some of the,

2427
02:21:23.901 --> 02:21:25.970
some of the neighbors are saying,
oh great,
it's called a pair of,

2428
02:21:25.971 --> 02:21:28.130
we're ready to start a beautiful day.
It was just some of the people,

2429
02:21:28.430 --> 02:21:31.140
the smaller group of people were saying,
Oh,
here's the call to prayer.

2430
02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:35.520
Let's go and attack Americans and,
and torture the local populace.
So,

2431
02:21:35.710 --> 02:21:39.200
and unfortunately because the mosque were protected and we had to get massive

2432
02:21:39.201 --> 02:21:42.710
approvals all the way up to like the highest levels to be able to enter,

2433
02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:46.820
enter the mosque.
Uh,
the bad guys knew that and they'd use those mosques to,

2434
02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:49.750
to stage a tax out of,
um,
you know,
and they'd,

2435
02:21:49.780 --> 02:21:53.110
they'd stockpile weapons and ammunition and stuff there.

2436
02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:58.070
So the bad guys figure it out.
It was,
uh,
it was not good.
Crazy,
man.

2437
02:21:58.250 --> 02:22:01.440
It's crazy.
The little detail,
Phil.
You know what I mean?
That,
I mean,

2438
02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:02.570
I always hear it from like you guys,

2439
02:22:02.571 --> 02:22:05.270
just a little detail stuff that you don't necessarily think about.

2440
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:08.810
You only think about,
oh yeah,
the,
the gun fights and all this stuff,

2441
02:22:08.811 --> 02:22:12.410
but just those little details kind of makes it real,
man.
That's crazy.

2442
02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:18.470
Any other questions?
Echo Charles or comments?
No,

2443
02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:23.630
sorry.
Very good to see life again.
That's it.

2444
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:26.040
Good.
Blake,
you got

2445
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.920
<v 2>anything else,
brother?
Yeah,
just great to be back on here with you guys again.</v>

2446
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:33.240
You know,
it's,
it's awesome.
Uh,
uh,
thinking back to the podcast 11,
you know,

2447
02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:37.800
I was the first guest,
uh,
and just getting this thing up and running,
you know,

2448
02:22:37.801 --> 02:22:41.690
and,
and to see the reach that it's,
uh,
that it's hat and as,

2449
02:22:41.691 --> 02:22:43.890
as the expansion and,
uh,
you know,

2450
02:22:43.891 --> 02:22:47.390
and where we're sitting today versus where it was then,
um,
you know,

2451
02:22:47.430 --> 02:22:49.110
the third time I'm back on,
it's pretty,
pretty awesome.

2452
02:22:49.170 --> 02:22:51.690
Pretty awesome to see that.
And I've so many people,

2453
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:56.710
I'm going to sit in Jujitsu classes before someone hears me talk and w or you

2454
02:22:57.241 --> 02:23:02.220
leaf that.
Exactly.
I guess,
I guess,
yeah,
the raspy voices.
It has given me a way,

2455
02:23:02.221 --> 02:23:02.700
but they're like,

2456
02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:05.760
I started training Jujitsu cause the Jocko podcast and I've had that happen

2457
02:23:05.761 --> 02:23:10.080
multiple times.
Um,
you know,
uh,
or they're in Jujitsu class or meeting someone at,

2458
02:23:10.081 --> 02:23:14.100
you know,
uh,
uh,
randomly in an airport or those kinds of things.
And,
uh,

2459
02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:18.120
it's just awesome.
It's awesome to see troopers all over the world,
uh,
you know,

2460
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:21.390
all over the,
all over the place,
getting after it,
uh,
you know,

2461
02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:26.010
through and loyal listeners,
Jocko podcast and passing it on to others.
I,
uh,

2462
02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:29.670
echo asked me that because we get a lot of people that on social media,
they say,

2463
02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:34.020
Hey,
I just enlisted in the army.
I just listened to Marine Corps.
I'd go to Ocs,

2464
02:23:34.021 --> 02:23:38.370
a lot of people,
you know,
thanks for pushing me that way or whatever.

2465
02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:40.890
And Echo says,
you know,
like,
Hey,
do you think,

2466
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:45.720
how many people do you think have actually joined the military because of the

2467
02:23:45.721 --> 02:23:49.440
podcast?
And I said,
you know,
I don't know what that number looks like,

2468
02:23:50.310 --> 02:23:54.120
but there's the amount of people that have started Jujitsu because of the

2469
02:23:54.121 --> 02:23:57.180
podcast is a big number.
It's a big number,

2470
02:23:57.181 --> 02:23:59.970
which is awesome because obviously you had us do Jitsu was really good.

2471
02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:01.320
I think the number of people join the military,

2472
02:24:01.321 --> 02:24:02.640
it's probably substantial as well.
In fact,

2473
02:24:02.641 --> 02:24:06.180
I was just talking to a young lady last night at the event we were speaking to

2474
02:24:06.181 --> 02:24:10.020
it,
um,
who came up to me and said,
hey,
I'm thinking about joining the navy.
And uh,

2475
02:24:10.021 --> 02:24:12.270
you know,
he'd said she just started listening to Jocko podcasts.

2476
02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:13.410
I think those are very much related.

2477
02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:18.000
I told her to go buy a copy of extreme ownership and uh,
you know,
to uh,

2478
02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:18.750
uh,

2479
02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:21.280
to learn from that and take ownership of everything in the world she was going

2480
02:24:21.281 --> 02:24:25.500
to do well.
So she was,
uh,
she was an EMT and a whatever.

2481
02:24:25.501 --> 02:24:26.490
You a navy corpsman.

2482
02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:31.491
So I think so many people from all walks of life influence for good by the Jocko

2483
02:24:31.770 --> 02:24:34.650
Buck.
Yes,
definitely.
Definitely.

2484
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.700
Definitely awesome for us to be a part of it and get all that feedback all the

2485
02:24:38.701 --> 02:24:39.330
time.
And,

2486
02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:43.020
and of course there's no coincidence to the fact that you were the first guest

2487
02:24:43.021 --> 02:24:47.610
on here,
obviously.
I just did an echo escalation.

2488
02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.350
That was,
that was good.
Would
you have an influence in the world?

2489
02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:54.571
I hope you,

2490
02:24:54.571 --> 02:24:58.650
I hope there's not someone out there that doesn't like it and blames you and

2491
02:24:58.651 --> 02:25:02.130
then it goes on a crazy like stalker mission to eliminate you from the world.

2492
02:25:03.630 --> 02:25:06.070
Luckily he's pretty good at Jujitsu,
so I need to take care of him.

2493
02:25:06.090 --> 02:25:09.210
And he's got a lot of knives and hatchets so nice.

2494
02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:12.420
Any other closers?
Yeah.
You know what?

2495
02:25:12.421 --> 02:25:16.470
I was just thinking we were having that conversation yesterday,
you know,
and uh,

2496
02:25:16.890 --> 02:25:21.870
uh,
as a dad of young kids,
you know,
I've got a,
I've got a toddler and a baby.
Um,

2497
02:25:21.930 --> 02:25:26.870
and uh,
you know,
I know that Echo,
you've got young kids as well.
Um,

2498
02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:28.270
and um,
you know,

2499
02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:32.290
just thinking about it can be all you parents out there know what I'm talking

2500
02:25:32.291 --> 02:25:34.420
about.
Right.
He can be exhausting.
You know,
we'd gone through a time,

2501
02:25:34.421 --> 02:25:35.171
it's winter time.

2502
02:25:35.171 --> 02:25:39.040
He got kids who've got colds and they're sick and they're waking up multiple

2503
02:25:39.041 --> 02:25:43.990
times a night cutting into my,
my four 45 club workouts,
you know.
Um,

2504
02:25:44.050 --> 02:25:47.070
and it's,
it's easy to like,
it's easy.
You know,
when my,

2505
02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:51.940
my little baby girl crawls around on the floor,
she just tries to eat everything,

2506
02:25:51.941 --> 02:25:54.840
you know,
picks up the choking hazards and,
and,

2507
02:25:54.850 --> 02:25:57.490
and shoves him around and you got to keep an eye on him.
Could constantly,

2508
02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:01.990
you know,
and my son is just a wild man.
He's just,
he'll,
he'll just,

2509
02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:03.880
no fear of anything.
It's just,

2510
02:26:03.881 --> 02:26:06.940
I'm learning that he's just like me and I realize what my parents actually put

2511
02:26:06.941 --> 02:26:07.600
up with,

2512
02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:12.100
but he takes off running for the most dangerous thing within a mile radius.

2513
02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:14.230
And,
and he just like,

2514
02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:19.210
without looking back and without heating any warning or command to stop for me

2515
02:26:19.211 --> 02:26:23.200
whatsoever.
So,
so it's,
it is full time and I'm in the game all the time.

2516
02:26:23.201 --> 02:26:27.310
And it can be exhausting.
It can be.
Um,
it's something that,
uh,
you can think,

2517
02:26:27.330 --> 02:26:30.010
oh man,
I just can't wait till they get a little bit older and I don't have to,

2518
02:26:30.250 --> 02:26:30.521
you know,

2519
02:26:30.521 --> 02:26:33.940
I can tell him to stop or he knows not to run to the street or my daughter's not

2520
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.530
choking on something,
something she,
you know,
and,
uh,
and,
and the reality is,

2521
02:26:38.531 --> 02:26:41.140
you know,
just being out here read Jocko and seeing his kids,
you know,

2522
02:26:41.141 --> 02:26:44.290
and your oldest daughter's about to graduate now from,
from high school,

2523
02:26:44.890 --> 02:26:49.660
which is amazing to me because when I left,
you know,
San Diego here,
uh,

2524
02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:53.530
you're,
you're,
you're kids.
They were kids.
They were little,
you know,

2525
02:26:53.531 --> 02:26:56.830
and watch them grow up into teenagers now.
And you know,
when we first met,

2526
02:26:56.831 --> 02:26:59.440
we started working with the potassium,
the bruises.
They were really little,

2527
02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:02.950
you know,
uh,
your youngest hadn't even been born and you're still on.
It was just,

2528
02:27:02.951 --> 02:27:06.310
uh,
uh,
I mean just a baby,
uh,
two or three years old.

2529
02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:08.580
And so I just read,

2530
02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:12.510
I realize it doesn't seem like I left the navy that long ago,
you know,
it,

2531
02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:14.810
it'll be six years this summer.
Um,

2532
02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:18.880
and I realized that time has flown by like that.
It has just gone by like that.

2533
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:23.150
And,
uh,
and so seeing that,
seeing your kids,
now I,

2534
02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:26.350
I got to take a step back,
the detachment that we always talk about,
right?

2535
02:27:26.351 --> 02:27:31.090
To be able to see with a bigger perspective of think
these moments,

2536
02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:33.680
right?
They dare.
Awesome.
And yeah,

2537
02:27:33.690 --> 02:27:38.690
I got to relish every nanosecond of them because my kids are gonna grow up and

2538
02:27:40.181 --> 02:27:42.160
they're going to be teenagers and they're going to graduate high school and

2539
02:27:42.161 --> 02:27:46.050
they're going to go off.
Uh,
and I got arrested,
you know,
for me and my wife.
Um,

2540
02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:49.650
we got to cherish those moments.
And people tell you that,
you know,
but you,

2541
02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:52.870
you still don't even like embrace it.
You know,
you still like,
Oh,

2542
02:27:52.890 --> 02:27:57.490
if I can just get to this level,
he's all worried about the diaper,
dirty diaper.

2543
02:27:59.250 --> 02:28:02.290
Exactly.
You know,
and uh,
or,
or you know,

2544
02:28:02.530 --> 02:28:05.520
my kid just went through my drawer and threw everything out and not going to

2545
02:28:05.530 --> 02:28:06.910
clean that up and we're trying to get out the door.

2546
02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:11.890
So I think for me it's a great recognition of like that those moments are

2547
02:28:11.891 --> 02:28:16.270
fleeting,
they're precious and a,
you got to enjoy every second of that.

2548
02:28:16.271 --> 02:28:20.280
So for you parents out there listening to this,
if you're in that boat,
w w with,

2549
02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:21.980
with me,
detach,

2550
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:26.810
<v 3>take a step back.
Think about how wonderful those moments are.
Um,
and uh,</v>

2551
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:31.220
and just,
just relish,
relish every moment.
And,
uh,

2552
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:36.390
don't let yourself get flustered.
Don't let yourself get overwhelmed.
Um,

2553
02:28:36.530 --> 02:28:38.090
if your kids getting up at four 30 in the morning,

2554
02:28:38.091 --> 02:28:43.030
maybe it's time to back it up to a zero 300 club.
But uh,

2555
02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:46.680
embrace every,
every second of that as,
as a parent and a,

2556
02:28:46.681 --> 02:28:49.130
a cherish those moments because those are the most important things of all.

2557
02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.200
I'll give you a,
you all give a small tip that helped me with that.
You know,

2558
02:28:54.201 --> 02:28:56.370
when like certain things get overwhelming you,

2559
02:28:56.371 --> 02:28:59.000
you're trying to do this and they're crying and then the other one's doing

2560
02:28:59.001 --> 02:29:02.060
something and you're like,
you kind of want to yell at them,
be like,
Hey,

2561
02:29:02.061 --> 02:29:05.390
I need a minute or something.
But they're like,
kids are like a minute,

2562
02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:07.760
but what does that even mean?
Kind of thing.
They don't know.

2563
02:29:07.761 --> 02:29:11.210
So the tip there is anytime you feel it bubbling up,

2564
02:29:11.211 --> 02:29:12.650
like you're getting frustrated,

2565
02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:17.540
understand that you're at that moment and making it about yourself and it's not

2566
02:29:17.541 --> 02:29:20.300
about yourself.
You know,
it's about the weather.
You can look at it in a minute.

2567
02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:24.050
I'm going to make it about the mission or I'm going to make it about these kids.

2568
02:29:24.620 --> 02:29:27.590
Make it about something other than yourself and you won't be frustrated anymore.

2569
02:29:28.170 --> 02:29:32.210
I'm telling you anytime,
anytime you're like,
oh,
I've been up all night,

2570
02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:35.570
this baby's been crying to what?
You're just making it about yourself right now.

2571
02:29:35.630 --> 02:29:40.340
Oh,
he,
you,
Oh,
you,
oh,
you poor parent.
You know.
Meanwhile,
everyone,
you know,

2572
02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:42.320
many parents have been through the exact same thing.

2573
02:29:42.410 --> 02:29:45.080
You're making it about yourself right now.
You're feeling sorry or whatever.

2574
02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:45.650
You know,

2575
02:29:45.650 --> 02:29:48.020
just don't make it about yourself and know that that's what you're doing.

2576
02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:51.640
If you feel that and then it solved.
That's exactly right.
Exactly right.

2577
02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:55.760
Check the ego essentially.
Yeah.
It's about them.
They should.
Yeah,
exactly.

2578
02:29:55.761 --> 02:29:59.810
It's not about you right now.
That's a good one.
Yeah.
That's great.
Great Advice.

2579
02:29:59.811 --> 02:30:00.644
Lafe and uh,

2580
02:30:00.990 --> 02:30:04.970
haven't seen my kids grow up and see I'm about to leave the nest as they say.

2581
02:30:05.010 --> 02:30:05.843
Yeah.

2582
02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:11.000
Embrace that whole time and thanks obviously for common on again,

2583
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:14.900
I'm sure this won't be the last time and we'll,
we'll do it again

2584
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:21.080
and everyone else out there that's listening.
Thank you all.

2585
02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:26.140
Especially especially in the military personnel across the globe right now.

2586
02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:31.280
By the way,
they're not getting to enjoy those moments with their family.

2587
02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:33.680
They're out there in harm's way,

2588
02:30:34.910 --> 02:30:37.220
standing the watch for us.

2589
02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:42.470
So thank you to all of you,
to the police and law enforcement.

2590
02:30:44.410 --> 02:30:49.410
Stay proactive and aggressive in your fight against crime and stay safe out in

2591
02:30:52.241 --> 02:30:52.721
the streets.

2592
02:30:52.721 --> 02:30:57.700
And thank you all for keeping our streets safe and the firefighters and the MTS.

2593
02:30:57.880 --> 02:30:58.660
And again,

2594
02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:03.660
who we call and we thank only when we need you.

2595
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:08.020
Thanks for being there,

2596
02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:11.310
waiting to help us when we need it.

2597
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:18.250
And to the rest of you out there doing what you're doing

2598
02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:24.930
<v 0>as you go out there and do it.
Don't do it easy.</v>

2599
02:31:26.730 --> 02:31:31.500
Don't take it easy.
And if someone says to you,

2600
02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:36.060
take it easy,
tell him no.

2601
02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:41.100
Tell him you aren't going to take it easy.
Tell him you're going to go hard,

2602
02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:43.890
as hard as you can tell him,

2603
02:31:43.891 --> 02:31:48.891
you're going to push and grind and fight and work as hard as you can until you

2604
02:31:50.911 --> 02:31:53.160
have nothing left.

2605
02:31:55.730 --> 02:32:00.730
