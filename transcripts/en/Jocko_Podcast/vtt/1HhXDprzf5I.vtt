00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.220
This is Jocko podcast number one 13 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.680
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.800
I instantly lifted my m four as my eyes scanned the terrain above us.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580
I knew without looking that John and the other guys were moving.

5
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:19.110
As soon as my weapon came up,

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.900
Reno took off at a dead sprint and disappeared 20 feet to our left seconds

7
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:27.480
afterward.
Screams came from the area.

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.890
I moved forward scanning the environment as I moved,

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.560
wanting to come to Reno's aid as soon as possible,

10
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.800
but unwilling to leave behind my tactical sense.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.330
I heard three shots ring out as a Taliban fighter.

12
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.300
Tried to exit the shallow cut that they had been hiding in.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.960
His companion was locked in a fight with Reno.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.140
The dog was destroying his opponent.

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.900
Blood quickly covering the man's clothes.

16
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.760
I called Reno out of the fight and squeezed off several rounds as the man

17
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.720
reached for his weapon.

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.450
We quickly searched the area before moving on our pace even quicker than before.

19
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.390
The gun fire for sure had given away our position,

20
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.220
legs and lungs burned.
The elevation taking its toll.

21
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.200
As we finally reached our destination,

22
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.430
sitting on the edge of that mountain waiting for a ride.

23
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.620
I looked back at the last few hours.

24
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.060
I padded Reno's head twice tonight.

25
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:31.650
He had saved my life twice.
I owed him yet another debt of gratitude.

26
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.640
His body shivered slightly as the cold wind bid into him now that we weren't

27
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.990
moving,
the cold settled quickly.

28
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.840
I pulled off my coat and and wrap them in it,

29
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.530
pulling his body against mine to keep them warm tonight he had saved my life

30
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.830
tonight he had saved my brother's lives

31
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.430
and that is a little excerpt from the book Trident Canine Warriors,

32
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.930
my tail from the training ground to the battlefield with elite navy seal canines

33
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.040
by Mike Ritland,

34
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400
a CEO who ended up working with dogs training dogs and eventually starting a

35
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:20.820
company called [inaudible] international that trains dogs for,

36
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.600
for the most elite forces in the world.

37
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.200
And that was an excerpt that was from an operator talking about one of the dogs

38
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.520
that Mike had trained.

39
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.570
And Mike's written two other books besides Trident Canine Warriors.

40
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.680
He also wrote team dog and navy seal dogs,

41
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.680
which is a book aimed at teenagers.

42
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.760
And tonight we are lucky enough to have Mike with us on the podcast to talk

43
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:58.620
about how the hell he ended up doing what he is doing.

44
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.883
So Mike Ritland,

45
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 1>welcome aboard.
It's a both a pleasure and an honor to be here.</v>

46
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:09.040
I appreciate you having me.
So we always have to start where you started.

47
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.110
Tell us a little bit about Waterloo,
Iowa.
Well,

48
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.940
it's uh,
you know,
it's one of those,
one of those spots where I guess it's a,

49
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:21.690
it's a good place to be from,
uh,
not a whole lot happening in Iowa,

50
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.860
which honestly is why part of the reason why I got into dogs cause they're,

51
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.030
there's not a whole lot else going on.
Uh,

52
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.930
wrestling obviously is huge in Iowa and I had the,
uh,
the,

53
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.310
the pleasure of growing up during the gable era of Iowa wrestling and my dad

54
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.660
wrestled with Dan Gable in high school.
Um,
and so,
you know,

55
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.610
being kind of ingrained in that culture growing up.
Uh,

56
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.080
even though I never wrestled because he,
uh,

57
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.270
he can hardly walk and is so beat up from it,
he,
he swam.
And so all of us swam.

58
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.990
Long story short,
it was still a big part of my life,
but,
uh,
so I,
you know,

59
00:03:55.991 --> 00:04:00.130
growing up,
kind of having that mentality ingrained,
um,

60
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.410
you know,
it was a big,
big proponent of,

61
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:08.411
of where I'm at today and why I got involved in both the navy and dogs because

62
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:13.180
of the appreciation for,
uh,
you know,
for that mentality.
Um,

63
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.890
in terms of Waterloo,
it's a,
you know,
suburban town,
70,000 people.
Um,

64
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.220
I'd say lower,
middle class,
probably.
Um,

65
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.330
a lot of influence from Chicago and Milwaukee,
St Louis,
uh,
pretty,

66
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.430
pretty rough high school.
Uh,
growing up there wasn't,

67
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.350
wasn't the best of times for me,
but,
uh,

68
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.650
taught me a lot of hard lessons about perseverance and doing things even when

69
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:40.120
you don't want to do them and,
and facing things that you're not,
not,
uh,

70
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.410
willing to,
to be comfortable with facing and things of that nature.
And,

71
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.220
and,
uh,
it was on the swim team and,
and,
uh,

72
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.250
influenced by my grandfather's in terms of their service in world war two.
And,

73
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.920
and just always wanting to make a,
a,

74
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.480
an impact in terms of serving my country.
I know I'm a little younger than you,

75
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:01.690
but for me,
I was in junior high when the first Gulf War broke out and it scared,

76
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:06.190
scared the crap out of me.
A couple of years later I was like,
where do I sign up?

77
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.890
Like,
you know,
that that progression,
you know,

78
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:13.870
just in that couple of year period as is crazy.
But,
um,
but it,
you know,
those,

79
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:15.520
those experiences and seeing some,

80
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.550
some terrorist activity as a young kid growing up,
it really,

81
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.060
really shaped no different than,
uh,
than how it shapes,
you know,

82
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:25.990
the guys were constantly going against and the,
and the generations growing up,

83
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:30.370
which has a huge impact.
But,
uh,
from a recruiting standpoint.
But,
uh,
but yeah,

84
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.100
I mean it was just,
it was something that blue collar town,

85
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.640
patriotic grandfathers were,

86
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.710
were pipe fitters and the in World War II and what they do in World War II.

87
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.050
So My,
my mom's dad was on a minesweeper,
uh,
in the navy.

88
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.130
He was a cook and a straight outta navies,
Steven Seagal just to cook,

89
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.300
but he was just a cook.
But he,
um,
he was on a fleet of mine.

90
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:56.320
Sweepers was 98 and the fleet in the Mediterranean and the two of them came back

91
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:59.720
and he was on one them.
Um,
my dad's dad was in the army.

92
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.360
He actually just tells you how times have changed.
He,
uh,

93
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.740
he beat an out in English,

94
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:08.180
allied soldier to death in a bar fight somewhere in Europe,
uh,
during the war,

95
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.740
and they just send them home and discharged him.
Um,
you know,
but,
uh,
I didn't,

96
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.260
I didn't know him real well and I met him a couple of times.

97
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.710
He had a pretty rough,
rough go,
um,
you know,
after,
after the war and,
and,
uh,

98
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.960
it was basically an alcoholic and I only saw him three or four times maybe

99
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:27.560
growing up before he died.
But,
uh,
but my mom's dad has,
it was a huge influence.

100
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:32.150
You know,
I talked with him a lot about,
I was always fascinated by,
um,
you know,

101
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:36.800
his stories and his outlook and,
and uh,
just,
you know,
he wasn't,
it wasn't,

102
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:41.450
uh,
you know,
aversive to talking about it,
uh,
enjoyed talking about it.
But,

103
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:46.400
uh,
yeah,
just,
it was very inspiring and it just made me want to serve.
Uh,

104
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.771
you know,
I've,

105
00:06:46.771 --> 00:06:50.960
I've kind of always leverage my decisions in life on how I'm going to make the

106
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:55.660
most bang for my buck and get the most out of every decision.
I felt like,
uh,

107
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.660
you know,
it was,
it was my,
my turn to,
to,
you know,

108
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:02.180
carry the torch for a little bit.
How'd you hear about the teams?

109
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.570
I was a popular mechanics article that I read when I was in like ninth grade.
Uh,

110
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.020
and that was the first time I'd ever heard of it.
And it showed,
you know,
like,

111
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.860
you know,
to me,
like one of the things that I think recruits,

112
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:19.580
a lot of us is saying that it's,
it's actually the toughest military training.

113
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:22.850
They weren't by default,
I'm going to go do that then for sure.
Uh,

114
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:26.990
so that was part of it.
Um,
but,
uh,
yeah,
I mean I read that,
that,

115
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.410
and that was at a time when I was getting,
you know,
I got to,

116
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.510
got rolled up pretty hard a few times in high school and got jumped.
Yeah.

117
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.350
You were talking about that in your first book.
Yeah.

118
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.890
You got rolled up a couple of times and beat down.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
I was,

119
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:44.450
I was a runt in high school.
Like my freshman year.
I was five,
405 pounds.

120
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.480
That's fun.
And then that was when it happened,
you know,

121
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.770
juniors and seniors just wailing on me and uh,
you know,
I didn't,

122
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:56.390
I didn't have much of a chance there,
but,
uh,
you know,
and even when I graduated,

123
00:07:56.391 --> 00:08:00.980
I was the same height I am now.
And I weighed one 40,
you know,
so when I,
my first,

124
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:05.810
uh,
first id in the navy,
I was one 45 and I'm five 11,
you know,
so,

125
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.320
uh,
yeah,
I've,
I've put on a few pounds.
So did you,

126
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.180
did you do die fair program or anything like that?
I didn't.
I,
uh,
when I,

127
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.500
I originally tried to be a corpsman and,
uh,

128
00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:17.540
at that time this was [inaudible] 96 they were like,
yeah,

129
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.850
we're pretty heavy on Corman pick something else.
And it was like,

130
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.430
how about Intel specialists?
You know?

131
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.450
So I went to Isa School right out of boot camp and I,

132
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.670
when I graduated high school,
I was 17 still.

133
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:31.800
So I had to wait until I turned 18 to go to boot camp.
Uh,

134
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.410
so I went to boot camp in August,
uh,
Isa School and,
and checked into buds,
uh,

135
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.180
in spring of [inaudible] 97,

136
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.740
but I was the youngest youngest guy in the class and the whole,
the whole deal.

137
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.910
And what did you weigh then?
Uh,
I worked out pretty heavy in a school.

138
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:50.750
I got up to about one 55.
I think.
So,
yeah,
I mean I have to,

139
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.590
I mean I see pictures of a like,
you know,
Post Hell Week and first phase.

140
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:59.070
Like I look at,
I just broke out Auschwitz.
Yeah.
I mean it was nothing to me.

141
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.570
But um,
our,
we'd won 75 when I showed up saying,
yeah,

142
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.251
five 11,

143
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:09.780
one 75 and I weighed one 85 when I graduated because I put on 10 pounds.

144
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.880
I weighed one 65.

145
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:14.220
I think if you're a little bit scared cause I was like a scrawny,

146
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:16.980
I know one 75 might not sound scrawny,
but I wasn't,
I was,

147
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.280
it was pretty scrawny one 75.
And then they,

148
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.090
they put a little meat on the bones as they say,
because you can eat whatever.

149
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.350
I would order a Domino's cheese pizza,
extra cheese pizza.

150
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.500
Just about every night I had the same similar ritual.

151
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.660
You remember the country store.
Uh,

152
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.010
so at the end of every day after dinner I would go to the country store and

153
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.930
there was that little Mcdonald's next to,
Oh yeah,

154
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:43.290
you'd get some that think I'd get a quarter pounder with cheese value meal.

155
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.580
And then eat that.
And uh,
a box,
literally a box of 10,
uh,

156
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.660
oatmeal cream pies

157
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.820
and a 64 ounce let it Gatorade every night.

158
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.780
They're good and wolf it down.
No problem.
And I gained like eight pounds.

159
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.140
The thing is,
and I was telling somebody about this,
you know,

160
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:05.040
you run to chow and Yak every,
every meal you run to chow,

161
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.860
it's a mile there and it's a mile back.
Yeah.

162
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.340
And you go three or four times a day for cause sometimes you go at midnight.

163
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.350
So that means you're running between six and eight miles every day before you

164
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:18.660
even include any of the actual training.

165
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.720
So you're doing a lot of physical activity.
You can eat a lot.

166
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.590
You don't need a ton,
especially at that age too.
Oh yeah,
that's right.

167
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.620
And then you couple it with being cold most of the day.
That's true.

168
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.320
You're burning.
I want to what?
You're burning for calories.

169
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:34.890
It's a massive amount of calories.
It's gotta be 10 k plus the,

170
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.130
I didn't even think about the cold part.
Oh yeah.

171
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.830
Cause you are just cold all the time.
Just a hammer and calories away.
Um,

172
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.410
did you get done with buds and,
and you,
you were a swimmer,
right?

173
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.111
I was.

174
00:10:47.111 --> 00:10:49.690
So you're one of those people that I talk about like swimming was for you is

175
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.930
just super easy.
Actually,
no.
Uh,
I got,
I got rolled,
uh,

176
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.500
I started with two 14.

177
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.220
I got rolled six days before going to San Clemente island for swims.

178
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.330
You loser that well,
so the,

179
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.900
I pinched my psychiatric nerve at that look kind of doing land.

180
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.270
You're not a loser.
So then I just failed everything.
But you know,

181
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.920
it's kind of the kind of a running joke.
Like,
no,

182
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:12.840
I got rolled for swimming because it was the first thing that I,

183
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:13.950
I failed three of,

184
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:16.620
I failed everything after Laguna cause I will fit with the injury.

185
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:20.550
But I will say that,
um,
because I grew up in,

186
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:23.910
I will like my first time in the ocean was it buds.
Like,

187
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:27.240
I mean I'd been with knee high water at cocoa beach on spring break or whatever,

188
00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:29.760
but I'd never been out past the surf.
I had never swam at night.

189
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.020
They freak you out
a little bit.
I mean it was just Kinda,

190
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.550
it was like an over over stimulus type thing.
But,
uh,
for me,
you know,

191
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:42.660
not having a black line to look at,
you know,
and having a guide off the coast,
um,

192
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.250
you know,
was it a bit of a challenge?

193
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:48.050
But that for me the biggest thing was actually swimming with fins.
Yeah.

194
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.051
You know what,

195
00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:52.140
that's a good point because you could point people it's totally different
muscle.

196
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.040
Yeah.
Well,
and you know,
from,

197
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:58.360
from having swam and I grew up when I was from five until I graduated high

198
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:01.630
school.
I mean I had a partial scholarship offers,
uh,
you know,

199
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:05.740
to some local colleges for,
for swimming and,
and uh,
you know,

200
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:09.040
for me it was,
it came pretty natural.
I mean,
I was never a state champion,

201
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:13.260
but I went to state and did all right.
Um,
but,
you know,
showing it,

202
00:12:13.261 --> 00:12:18.261
so growing up with that muscle memory of how to swim without ever using fins

203
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.520
were not the first time I put those on.
It was duck for you.

204
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:24.790
You're like two by fours,
you know,
I mean,
they just destroyed my ankles,

205
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:28.840
especially being kind of scrawny anyway.
So for the,
for first phase,

206
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:32.590
like my feet and ankles were just destroyed the whole time.
You know,

207
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:37.360
like for me it was hard to swim and I mean,
I could pass,
but I wasn't,
I wasn't,

208
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:41.230
uh,
you know,
the guys out in the front,
just turtle back and then,
you know,

209
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.570
having fun.
Those guys,
I mean,

210
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.390
there was some Olympic swimmers or water polo players.

211
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.650
I had a couple of those guys where I just thought,
these guys are just studs,

212
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.250
but they weren't swimmers.
Yeah.

213
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.650
So that's why I figured you were breezing through the swims to no,
I mean,
I,

214
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.120
you know,
they didn't,
they didn't bother me,
you know,
but I,

215
00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:00.940
I was middle of the road.
I wasn't,
I wasn't blown anybody out of the water.

216
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:03.660
I think for them,
some of it is that,
uh,
you know,
an Iowa,

217
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.320
we were probably a little behind the power curve.

218
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:07.780
Technologywise now they do use a lot of fins,

219
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.630
little cheater fins and training fins and stuff.
And so there's,

220
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:11.830
there's some more to it than that.

221
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:15.190
Plus the guys that I saw that did really well were,

222
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:17.170
were more muscular than I was,
you know,

223
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:20.970
for me it was like those fins were about a quarter of my body weight,
you know?

224
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.540
And it was literally,
it was like having concrete shoes going for a jog.

225
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.710
I mean it was like,
uh,
yeah,
it didn't do me any favors.
It,

226
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.370
that took some getting used to for sure.
But the runs and swims,

227
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.450
what about the runs?
Runs no problem either.
Um,
you know,
really,

228
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:35.470
there was nothing that I,

229
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.730
I would say that I struggled with and I wasn't the best at everything,
but I,

230
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.630
you know,
I wasn't getting gooned either.
I was kind of a gray man on purpose,

231
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.120
which is the best place to be.
And one of my buddies,

232
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.950
he would say that they started the goon squad every single time with him.
Yeah,

233
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.540
I know.
It's quite,
if you're,

234
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.440
if you're slow on the run and you're get to sort of the end,

235
00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.130
and then there's an instructor waiting and these from this point on,

236
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:00.881
you're getting gooned,

237
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:04.600
which means you're going to do a bunch of crap and it's gonna suck in the sky

238
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:08.090
was the beginning of the goon squad every time,
which is not fun.
Yeah.

239
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.930
So what year was it when you graduated butts?
Um,

240
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.190
so it was a spring of [inaudible] 98 and then you went to team three.

241
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.900
I went to boot camp or a Benning jump school back when they still did that.

242
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:25.340
And then,
uh,
and then from there straight to team three and an Stt and,

243
00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:29.480
and I got my did the chiefs board thing,
which was a,
I wish they still did that.

244
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.400
You know,
I think that's a sacrilegious to do it the way they do it now.
But,
um,

245
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.840
yeah,
I got,
got my tried and in October of 98,
uh,

246
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:40.960
waited until January to Cla to jump into my first platoon.

247
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.340
And that was an Arg Alpha platoon.

248
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:47.341
So that was a 22 month workup with six months of fleet x ship deployments prior

249
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:52.070
to even deploy two arcs.
Man,
back to back our

250
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.460
<v 0>EXEC team,
Warren Park in the tourists.
I think they're valuable.</v>

251
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.460
What's ship did you do fully out the Duluth.
Oh righto.
An LPD six.
Yep.

252
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.250
Oh Man.
So that things from 1965 or 67 or something like this.
Some Vietnam.
Yeah.

253
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.710
Think they built these ships,
echo to take troops from here to Vietnam,

254
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:12.140
drop them off.
But then by the time we were on them,

255
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.980
they were just doing full six month deployment.

256
00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:18.080
So it was straight up World War II style canvas racks.
So little canvas racks.

257
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.880
There'd be four people sleeping,

258
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:23.030
stacked up like four bunks with these little canvas racks.

259
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.500
So this is the old school.
But I will say this,
I mean

260
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.870
<v 1>variances in terms of big navy,
like you don't get those for sure.
For sure.</v>

261
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.750
And doing the fleet x as we were on the,

262
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:36.600
the Abraham Lincoln and got to stand on the bridge watching f 14 his land and

263
00:15:36.601 --> 00:15:40.860
take off.
And,
um,
you know,
we got to do some pretty neat stuff that,
uh,

264
00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:42.870
that I'm glad,
glad we got to be a part of it.

265
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.500
<v 0>What was awesome for me was we were doing,
because when you're,</v>

266
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.500
when you're with them,
you're with,
uh,
the Marine Corps.

267
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.460
And so we did all these operations in conjunction with the Marine Corps.

268
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:56.870
So I was a comms guy.
What were you,
uh,
until guy,
so I was a comms guy,

269
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.340
so I was always interacting with all the other units that we'd be out there for

270
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:03.470
communications and then coordinating and all that stuff.

271
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:08.030
So I had a real leg up when it came to working with conventional forces,

272
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.660
which if you were in a regular spec ops platoon back then,

273
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.400
you wouldn't ever work with them.
I mean,

274
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:16.550
you'd rarely very rarely work with conventional forces.

275
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.140
So I did two orgs where I got to work with marines and do massive,
you know,

276
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.480
battalion sized operations and it had to coordinate all of those things.
So it,

277
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.310
it gave me a good introduction.
You'd get,

278
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:32.150
you'd get guys back in the teams back then,
they wouldn't even know.

279
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.130
They wouldn't even know.

280
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.100
They wouldn't even understand what the Marine Corps battalion was or,
or one,
uh,

281
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.610
company was or what a platoon was.
They just wouldn't know.

282
00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:43.760
Now everybody knows we've gotten more professional as time has gone by.

283
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.170
But that gave me a,
I was real lucky that I had that arc platoon experience.

284
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.780
I mean,
like I said,
just getting,
uh,
you know,

285
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.900
<v 1>I know that the big navy perspective on a lot of things I think is,</v>

286
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.800
is valuable,
you know.
Um,
and,
and it was just neat from a,

287
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.790
for me at least from a traditional standpoint.
I mean,
cause we,
we did,
uh,

288
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.170
about a three week exercise in Australia where we tested out a fast catamaran

289
00:17:08.171 --> 00:17:12.430
that they were testing for,
for,
for us,
basically the thought was,

290
00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:16.090
is this thing to do like 55 knots?
You know,
and it's the size of a,
you know,

291
00:17:16.091 --> 00:17:19.540
it's bigger than like a guided missile cruiser minutes and medium sized ship

292
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.640
with a hole in the middle of the cat is a cat.
Um,

293
00:17:24.641 --> 00:17:26.130
but so the,
the,

294
00:17:26.131 --> 00:17:30.220
the thought process was we could deploy like a whole task element or at least a

295
00:17:30.221 --> 00:17:31.960
platoon.
I don't know if you remember the,

296
00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:33.850
I think they were with the hurricane class or whatever,

297
00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:38.851
those little swm amphibious boats that was kind of the same principle and they,

298
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.740
they can't it after a while.
But,
um,

299
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.760
same kind of principle is that these things do 55 knots.
And it was weird,

300
00:17:45.761 --> 00:17:49.260
you know,
we're out floating around and testing these things out,
doing,
uh,
some,

301
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.290
some exercises with some nor force Australian guys.

302
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:57.291
And it was more like being on a plane than a boat in terms of the way it felt

303
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.920
like when you're trying to sleep or whatever.
I mean,

304
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:03.480
imagine a boat that big doing 55 nights crazy.
That's completely crazy.
Yeah.

305
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.160
But you could put everything,
you know,

306
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:07.560
you could do a full task element loadout on it.

307
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:11.160
Be completely self sustaining and go 55 knots anywhere in the world,
you know,

308
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:14.340
so it,
it certainly had some,
some potential,
but,
uh,

309
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.960
obviously we never ended up doing them,

310
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.990
but are getting numb or implementing them.

311
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:23.250
So how many deployments did you do before the war kicked off?
Just that one.
Um,

312
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.680
so that was because it took so long,
it's 22 month workup.

313
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.760
Then you did a six month deployment,
then you come back from that.
Well,
so yeah,

314
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:33.390
the,
the,
the kind of the,
the raw deal that,
uh,
I mean,

315
00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:36.570
I guess I couldn't call it a raw deal,
but for me,

316
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.950
so we got back in February of 2001 mid February.

317
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.340
And uh,
because it was right in the middle of force 21 reorg.
Oh,

318
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.090
that's right.
So it was team three,

319
00:18:48.091 --> 00:18:51.720
their official force 21 form up.

320
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.040
It wasn't until January of [inaudible].
So from February to January,

321
00:18:56.041 --> 00:19:00.720
the entire team was basically like on pro Dev or,
or whatever.
And you know,

322
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:02.550
I'd only done one platoon.
So they're like,
yeah,

323
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:05.700
you're not going to free fall yet.
Now we've got two other guys going to sniper.

324
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.060
It's like you can go to Hazmat.
That's cool.
Awesome.

325
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.810
How about you can be a bus driver.
Um,

326
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.120
so I ended up actually going over the CISM team.

327
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:19.070
I don't know if you're that because you're a swimmer,
navy pentathlon you know,

328
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.840
at team three,
I was always like,
when we did run,
swim runs,
you know,

329
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.990
there's one thing being a little smaller at that time and being a good swimmer

330
00:19:25.991 --> 00:19:29.870
and a pretty decent runner,
I could always get top three,
top five at the,

331
00:19:29.871 --> 00:19:34.070
at the team on,
on any given day doing swims and runs.
And so,
uh,

332
00:19:34.071 --> 00:19:38.670
I went over and tried out and made the team and competed and we were supposed to

333
00:19:38.671 --> 00:19:42.990
compete in a,
is Stan bold that summer,
did the whole,
you know,

334
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.250
trained for six months and,
and busted my,
my backside and then,
uh,

335
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.080
I pull,
I pulled him are tore my groin.
Um,
and uh,
and I just,
I,

336
00:19:53.081 --> 00:19:55.920
I couldn't,
I couldn't get it healed and time.
And so I ended up not,

337
00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:58.520
not being able to go compete,
which really sucked.
I was,

338
00:19:58.521 --> 00:20:01.560
I was looking forward to doing it,
but it was a neat experience.

339
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:04.380
So it was totally different.
It was,
you know,
the first time in my life.

340
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:07.650
And the only time it was like being a professional athlete,
you know,
we'd,

341
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.060
we'd train for three,

342
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:11.460
four hours in the morning and then swim for two and a half hours in the

343
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:16.170
afternoon and do a Saturday long,
long run or long practice.
And that was it.

344
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:20.790
The rest of the system stand for?
Uh,
it's,
I mean,
it's not even an English,

345
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:22.790
I don't think.
Um,
it's a,

346
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.210
it's basically like military Olympics kind of.

347
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.440
It's the navy pentathlon so it's a,
okay.
So the,
the,
the events events,

348
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.140
uh,
so it's,
uh,
an old course,
but it's a totally different,
you know,

349
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:39.450
it's that sort of real squirrely Oh,
course and I don't even know small.
Yeah,

350
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:43.680
you just,
it's really fast.
Like it's one of the every sprint.
Yeah.
Uh,

351
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:48.310
so there's that,
there's um,
a like a,
I don't even know what they call it.

352
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.960
It's like a naval traditional race thing where your paddle a little boat and you

353
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:57.430
go out around a dinghy and have to do shackles,
whatever.
What's shackles?
Well,

354
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:57.850
like,

355
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.320
like it's literally like you go around a buoy and have to take a shackle off and

356
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:06.350
connect it to something else.
Like it's,
so there's a little traditions challenge.

357
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.020
Yeah.
Um,
same thing with underwater oh.
Course.
Which that,

358
00:21:10.021 --> 00:21:11.230
that one was pretty legit.

359
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.880
It's 125 yard underwater obstacle course.

360
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.980
And you got those big three foot,
um,

361
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.330
carbon fiber free fins on.
So you're doing,
I mean,
it's like,
you know,

362
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:23.610
like why couldn't I have these?
And you know,

363
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.560
but it's like you're thinking about combat swimmer,

364
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:29.950
like I'm going to steal some of these,
but,
uh,
yeah,
I mean,

365
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:34.510
so I'd say 90% of that hundred and 25 yard race is underwater.
You know,

366
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.990
you only come up at the,
at the end and blow out and take a breath,
like a,

367
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.440
like a damn Orca,
you know,
you're just like,
you know,

368
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.400
and go right back tasks underwater.
Yeah.
So there's,
there's a,

369
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.040
like a cargo net with a hole at the bottom.
You've got,
you know,

370
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.000
and this is over the CTT and the 15 foot sections.

371
00:21:51.001 --> 00:21:55.450
So you're going from the top down to the bottom and then back to the top at the

372
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:58.570
other side.
And so the only time you're taking a breath is at the end.

373
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.210
And I will tell you from a physical standpoint,

374
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:05.560
like that was one of the more taxing things I've ever done because it's a race

375
00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:09.100
and it's technique and whatever,
but so there's a cargo net.
You got to go under,

376
00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:12.550
he got to swim a rubber m 16 from one side to the next,

377
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:15.670
holding it out of the water.
Uh,
but you're,
you know,
you're basically,

378
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:18.880
your whole body's underwater with just the rifle out and your streamline and

379
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.240
whatever.
It's all technique stuff that you're,
you know,
whatever.
Um,

380
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.260
and then you have to go down,
you know,
you go to one side and come back.
Uh,

381
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.980
so basically you swim the [inaudible] across,
you drop it,

382
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.710
you swim all the way down through that hole,
come back up.

383
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.140
So I'm back down to back to the other side and undo this little like firehose

384
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.920
shackle thing and put it back together,

385
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:44.120
come up and then sprint back to the other side type of thing.
And uh,
that,

386
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.840
that was pretty,
pretty challenging.
But,
um,
so there's that.

387
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:50.560
And then there's a lifesaving thing where you got to do it,
you know,

388
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:53.440
save a dummy basically,
but you have to get out of your clothes and,

389
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:57.670
and so like you're wearing these old buds greens and they're all like rigged so

390
00:22:57.671 --> 00:23:02.140
that you can get out of them.
Like literally you undo the pants,
you know,

391
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:03.940
and like,
it's just an old technique thing,

392
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:06.310
but you can go from having full Greens on in the watt,

393
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:10.210
taking them off in the water by doing like this porpoise backflip thing and you

394
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:12.970
backflip out of them and,
and then go save the guy.
And it's,

395
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.690
it's really kinda dumb,
honestly.
Like,
it's all like,

396
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.470
I feel ridiculous even sitting here explaining it sounds even more stupid.

397
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.770
Here's explaining it to you guys,
not knowing what it is.
But,
uh,
um,
but you,
so,

398
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.980
<v 0>so there were some underwater shit going on.
Basically what I'm hearing,</v>

399
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.120
you can't go because you,
you get injured and now,

400
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.370
so shortly after you were supposed to compete,

401
00:23:35.371 --> 00:23:38.610
if that was supposed to be in the summer of 2001 September 11th,
it goes down.

402
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.160
Yeah.
You,
you get rolled back into opportunity at that point.

403
00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.460
<v 1>Well,
so I,
I did a couple of Intel schools,</v>

404
00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:46.010
some a secret scroll ones that were pretty awesome during

405
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.810
<v 2>that summer after I got hurt.
Uh,
and then I literally,
in fact,
one of them,</v>

406
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:55.730
I flew back the night before September 11th.
On September 10th,
I flew from,

407
00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.680
from DC to San Diego.
Um,
I get home,
September 11th happens,

408
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:02.900
I'm on my,
were living in the Hoya at the time.

409
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.500
I was on my way into seal team three and,
you know,
getting ready to,

410
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:09.770
to jump in a platoon when it happened.
And so obviously like with everybody,

411
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:12.470
you know,
all bets are off and figuring out what we're going to do.

412
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.570
There was an exercise in Jordan,
uh,

413
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.880
that they sent me on a couple of weeks later and they,

414
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.100
they beefed it up pretty heavy,
like it was going to be a,
you know,

415
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:24.170
a minimal footprint.
But after September 11th,

416
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:26.750
they ended up sending way more people and a lot more resources.

417
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:30.320
It kind of set it up almost like a,
um,
like a,

418
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.660
like a potential five if need be.
You know,

419
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:35.180
they had a couple of platoons worth of guys and,
and you know,

420
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:37.580
people with experience and brought real stuff and you know,

421
00:24:37.581 --> 00:24:40.160
kind of a contingent if if need be,
you know,
nothing.

422
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.590
We didn't end up doing anything but uh,

423
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:47.060
but we spent actually almost two months over there right after September 11th is

424
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:50.530
almost like a mini deployment,
you know.
Uh,
but got back from that,

425
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.320
jumped into my platoon in January and then it was,
you know,
full speed ahead.

426
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:56.150
Like,
I mean,
not that I know you were saying,
well,

427
00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:58.070
it's not that you weren't training for war before,

428
00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:02.440
but there was definitely a repurpose.
Yeah.
And then you,
you,

429
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.590
you deploy and you did the,
you did the oil rigs,
right?
I did.
So,
you know,

430
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.730
just to kind of,
you know,
lucky luck of the draw,
I guess,
you know,
we,
uh,

431
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.200
we were originally slated to be a,
um,
I pay con platoon.

432
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.040
Uh,
we're going to go to Guam and,
and when we did,
but,
uh,
you know,

433
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:22.820
so I actually reenlisted to,
to go to Arabic school and,
uh,

434
00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:26.990
at Dli and that was one of my things.
I wanted to learn Arabic.
And,
uh,
so they,

435
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.860
they,

436
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.040
they were supposed to honor that and then we got re slated as a pay competent

437
00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:33.780
and like not you're going to learn to Galligan instead,
congratulations.

438
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.320
And was like,
you gotta be kidding me.
Uh,
so I speak to colleagues,

439
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.110
I wouldn't say I speak to you,
not at Dli.
They,
so they,
you know,

440
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.410
in true navy fashion,
it's like you're not going to Arabic,

441
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:47.180
you're not going to Dli,
you're learning to Galligan.

442
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.460
It's going to be at north island for three months straight.
So,
uh,

443
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.660
it's not the same.
Um,
but,
uh,
yeah,

444
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:56.320
I mean I can carry on a basic conversation with it,
but uh,
so anyway,

445
00:25:56.321 --> 00:26:00.860
we go to go to Guam and this is like October of of o two and uh,

446
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.080
and then,
you know,
we're,
we did the,
the standard pay come deployment,

447
00:26:06.081 --> 00:26:08.660
but towards the end of the year they basically,
you know,

448
00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:11.000
the writing was on the wall,
like our racks going to kick off.

449
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.440
So team five came and back filled us.
And I'll tell you,
I,

450
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.480
I don't know that they could have been any more pissed,
you know,

451
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.680
like our turnover party almost was nine fist fights,
you know,
like,

452
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.770
but they were pretty salty about John and blaming,

453
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.680
but so they had to come take our place and finish out our pay common deployment

454
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:32.570
so we could go to Kuwait.
Wow.
Those guys must have been painful or beyond pissed.

455
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:37.040
There's,
there's a feeling that we won't be able to replicate for a long time,

456
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.380
which is guys that had never been to war,

457
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:44.010
the desire that you had to go,
cause you think you're only going to get like

458
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.790
<v 0>one mission.
Everyone at that time,
you're like faking.</v>

459
00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.670
If you get to do some kind of real mission,
you'll be just completely,

460
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.990
your life will be complete.
And you think,
if you don't get to do that,

461
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.320
you're never an opportunity.
He's never gonna get there.
And,

462
00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.320
and so that's why I can't even imagine what was going through those guys' heads

463
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:01.920
at the time.

464
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.820
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
like I said,
they,
they had that exact just pit in their stomach.
Like,</v>

465
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.270
we're this close and you guys,
you know,
you've already been here,
like,
and we,

466
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.070
it was Kinda the best of both worlds.
Cause you know,

467
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:13.810
we went to the Philippines for awhile,
which that,

468
00:27:13.811 --> 00:27:17.160
that was nice speaking to Gallog very,
you know,
we were there for a month.
Um,

469
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.170
and then we went to Singapore for a while.
We,
uh,
Thailand,
I mean,
it was a good,

470
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.300
good pay,
common deployment.
Spent some time ago,

471
00:27:24.301 --> 00:27:28.770
I went to Hawaii and did like a three week exercise around Christmas.
Uh,

472
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.150
you know,
and then,
um,
but yeah,
so,
you know,
come late January and they're like,

473
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:33.780
you know,

474
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.670
they fly in all of our desert stuff and totally repurpose and all of our are

475
00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:42.980
crap.
And,
uh,
and then yeah,
we flew through Thailand,
Landon,
Kuwait,

476
00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:47.790
set up shop at Kuwaiti naval base for about six weeks while we're getting ready.

477
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.370
And so during that time,
the,
uh,

478
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.100
the oil rig entails me being the Intel Rep,

479
00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:57.840
like I was sourcing Intel from a lot of different sources.
Um,
and they,

480
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.330
they weren't very well corroborated.
Like some of them,

481
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.150
it was kind of like on one end of the spectrum it was like,
yeah,

482
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:05.430
it's not that big a deal.
And then on the other one I was like,
dude,

483
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.200
this is a suicide mission,
you know,
and everything in between.
And so,
uh,

484
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.740
it was a little,
a little bit nerve wracking,
uh,
because it bounced around a lot.

485
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:16.400
It was like,
you know how there's,
there's nobody on board.
And then it's like,
wow,

486
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.730
there's four guys and saw a couple eight ks and next thing you know,
it's like,

487
00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:24.300
yeah,
there's 115 people and they're all suicide,
vest it up and you know,

488
00:28:24.301 --> 00:28:26.730
they're going to clock off when you guys step on,
you know,
it was just,

489
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.270
and it just likes that have bounced around.
But during that time,

490
00:28:30.271 --> 00:28:33.270
like all we did was CQC and a,

491
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.600
and we built actually a full scale mock up.
Now mind you,

492
00:28:36.601 --> 00:28:38.670
this target was 1600 meters long.

493
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.620
I mean it took us seven hours to take it down and um,
but you know,

494
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:48.300
STV did a recon on it beforehand and we built a full mock up.
We mean,

495
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.660
I mean I say that I,
you know,
we didn't have,
uh,

496
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.780
the funds of some of the other units to do that stuff with,
but,
uh,

497
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.380
it was basically size wise,
we laid out like rec with tape,

498
00:28:59.381 --> 00:29:03.480
state wood,
wood stakes in it and twine.

499
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.030
But just to know,
like,
Hey,
this is legitimately how wrong it is to give,

500
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.870
give you a real idea because,
um,
you know,

501
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:13.230
so there was birthing at one end and that's where we hit it at the beginning

502
00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:14.940
because it was the middle of the night.
That's where they all were.

503
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:19.560
And so we took,
took,
uh,
it was 32 32 prisoners,
um,

504
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.700
without,
without really any,
any real issue,
um,

505
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.150
breached a bunch of doors and took down the whole birthing and,

506
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.600
and then swept the whole rest of the thing from one end to the next.

507
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:35.040
And like I said,
it took,
took all night.
But,
um,

508
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.900
so yeah,
we did that and,
and uh,
and then came back from that.
And,
uh,

509
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.250
and then from there

510
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.630
<v 2>just it was basically,
hey,
you know,
everybody load up the worst kicking off.
And,</v>

511
00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:49.570
uh,
the,
the one thing I will say it was really neat about that mission though,

512
00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:52.030
is that it was the entire team.
And I think to this day,

513
00:29:52.031 --> 00:29:56.050
it's still the largest single in terms of,
you know,
participants,

514
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.430
special operations,

515
00:29:57.431 --> 00:30:01.330
mission in NSW history is cause it was the entire team and the coordination

516
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:05.320
effort because there was a manifold metering station,
uh,
on the beach.

517
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.720
And then there's 26 miles of pipelines that were 48 inch pipes.
You know,

518
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:15.520
there was like 30 Exxon lb is worth of oil in these just in the pipelines and

519
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:19.060
the,
and the worry was,
and the reason we had to coordinate it was that,
you know,

520
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:20.830
the,
the manifold metering station,

521
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.530
there's people manning that and there's people on the,

522
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.650
on the oil rig and all that pipeline.
If they blow that,

523
00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:31.270
like it's going to destroy the whole goal if you run and will be the 48 inch

524
00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:35.920
pipe.
Yeah.
Yea.
Yeah.
I mean you'd walk around in them,
that's crazy.
Um,

525
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.270
and there was like four of them,
you know,
so,
um,
but yeah,

526
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:43.470
so basically we had to coordinate with,
um,
and,

527
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.350
and we actually had an STV platoon with us.
Uh,
so it was us in a,

528
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:52.330
in an STV one platoon that hit the,
the,
the,
uh,
there was two different oil rigs.

529
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:53.260
There was the,
uh,

530
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.860
the Mei bought and chaotic and the Mena Albach her oil terminal.

531
00:30:56.861 --> 00:30:59.680
And then the core Alomia oil terminal,

532
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:04.030
the k bought one or chaotic,
the grime guys took down.

533
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.320
There was nobody on that.
And then,
uh,
we took down the,
the one with,
you know,

534
00:31:08.321 --> 00:31:11.980
with all the people on it,
but we had to coordinate it basically time at exact,

535
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.160
uh,
with uh,
the other four platoons from team three,

536
00:31:15.161 --> 00:31:19.330
one of which was a DP DPV platoon when they were still using it.
I think that's,

537
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.330
it's probably the mission where they decided to can the program cause they were

538
00:31:22.331 --> 00:31:26.800
terrible and they all got stuck and it was,
there was a mass but,
but uh,
you know,

539
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:28.480
so they,
they met some resistance there.

540
00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:33.170
<v 0>Echo the DPV is like a desert patrol desert patrol vehicle,</v>

541
00:31:33.171 --> 00:31:37.190
but it looks like I'm Dune Buggy,
like a Dune buggy.
And,

542
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:42.080
and actually looks even super cooler than debugging cause they got big like guns

543
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.270
when you're a kid and you see that thing,

544
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.010
it's your ultimate fantasy in life coming true to see this bad ass dune bug guns

545
00:31:49.011 --> 00:31:52.850
with guns all over it,
rockets on it.
And you think,
oh,
this is,

546
00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.150
if you would have seen those when you were 13 years old,
you'd say,
whoever,

547
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.030
whatever I got to do with my life and drive that thing is what I'm going to do.

548
00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.500
The problem was there.
They're real specific and finicky and,

549
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:07.310
and they get stuck.
The bottom line,
it's like a,
I mean,

550
00:32:07.311 --> 00:32:12.260
they're worse than Humvees.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
So they took that down and uh,

551
00:32:12.261 --> 00:32:14.390
and we,
and we timed it basically where,
you know,

552
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.070
it was a simultaneous header or staggered by,
you

553
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.850
<v 2>know,
10 seconds.
But,
um,
so that,
you know what the,
the,</v>

554
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.230
the worry was that if we took it down too early,

555
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.070
then they would know a lot of the pipes and vice versa.
So,
uh,
so yeah,
we had to,

556
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.920
had to coordinate it pretty,
pretty,
uh,
spot on.
But,
but we pulled it off.
Um,

557
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.700
they managed to,
uh,
take out a few guys on the,
on the manifold side.
Uh,

558
00:32:37.701 --> 00:32:40.050
we didn't have any risk,
any resistance,
um,

559
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.040
no shots fired other than breaching doors on,
on our end.
But,

560
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.760
so we a rendezvous back at a Kuwaiti naval base and then we get it up to a

561
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:51.320
Aleasa Aleem air force base in northern Kuwait.

562
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.790
And then spent the next few days just bloating,
four Humvees out.
And,
and again,

563
00:32:55.791 --> 00:33:00.220
this was the start of the war.
We actually only had three.
And,
uh,
we ended up,
uh,

564
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.700
we snaked one from the air force and,
uh,
I don't even know if I should say it,

565
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:07.010
I'm going to say it anyway,
but,
uh,
there was a green,

566
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:10.430
green Humvee that couple of our guys walked over to a parking lot and stole it

567
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.650
and uh,
it brought it,
brought it over.

568
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:16.820
And we spent one night literally with two cans of tans paint and the paint brush

569
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:20.210
and just painted it Tan and then a,
these were soft doors.

570
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.530
We had extra crappy body armor that we'd hang in the doors to try to,
you know,

571
00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:27.440
give us some protection,
whatever.
And uh,
yeah,
we just were like,
well,
we're,

572
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:31.130
we're loading up.
We did have a guy,
it was his first platoon and he was,

573
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:36.080
he kind of lost his,
uh,
lost his marbles on the,
on the hit.
Like he was,

574
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:40.610
he was rattled to the point where,
you know,
he basically gave up and a,

575
00:33:40.611 --> 00:33:44.360
and hung it up,
didn't come with us.
He was a 60 gunner.
And uh,

576
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.460
so yeah,
we had a,

577
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.020
had an intel guy at the time that was not a team guy that is now,
um,

578
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.440
that jumped in his spot.
Basically.
We talk about like old school.

579
00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:57.140
Like I know they wouldn't,
they wouldn't let that stuff happen now.

580
00:33:57.141 --> 00:34:00.560
As big as like,
here's,
here's a,
here's a 60,
you know?

581
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:05.600
<v 0>Yeah.
Sitting in the door.
And that's cool.
That's also interesting.
You know,</v>

582
00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:09.240
people always,
it's one of those kind of myths or,

583
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.180
or misconceptions where people think that everyone,
that's a steal.

584
00:34:12.181 --> 00:34:14.120
It's like go do 100%.
And there you go.

585
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:18.860
You got a guy that did one operation and said,
I'm not going any further.

586
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.370
I remember

587
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.010
<v 2>Laura,
I think there was a couple of guys on the west coast that,</v>

588
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.550
that turning their birds in after nine 11,
you know,
they're all like,

589
00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.750
I didn't sign up for this.
Like what did you sign up for it?
Yeah.
You know,
but um,

590
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.330
yeah,
I mean,
and there was a couple of instances to where,
uh,
you know,
you'd,

591
00:34:35.331 --> 00:34:39.860
you'd find out things about guys that just like being a bud's instructor,
um,

592
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.620
don't ever count anybody out.
Don't ever bet on it.
Yeah.

593
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:46.400
<v 0>Cause there's people that'll surprise you both ways.
You know,</v>

594
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.830
I always feel like somebody was asking me that the other day.

595
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:52.910
I was feel like you can,
you can get an indication,
right?
Like you,
you know what?

596
00:34:52.911 --> 00:34:57.330
This guy pretty hardcore.
Yeah.
I,
I'd go,
I'd go 80%,
you know,

597
00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:02.270
maybe 90% and you think,
oh,
this guy is pretty weak.
I go 80%,

598
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:04.760
90%.
But there's,
like you said,

599
00:35:04.761 --> 00:35:07.520
there's outliers or there's people that you just think of what the,
what,
what,

600
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.670
what just happened to that guy.
And it's another thing I'm having,

601
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.620
I'm having to contend with now as I get a little bit older is the fact that even

602
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:18.680
though I'm all about human nature and all this stuff and like I really want to

603
00:35:18.681 --> 00:35:20.450
understand people sometimes I just looked at him like,

604
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:22.460
I don't literally don't understand what your problem is.

605
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.850
Like why would a big one,
so there was a,

606
00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.880
there was a navy ship out in front of my house the other day and I took a

607
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:32.730
picture of it and I sent it to like Lafe and JP and,

608
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.100
and Dave Burke and infant Cochran.
And I was like,
the navy was good to me,

609
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.980
but

610
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.870
<v 3>I don't miss these big great monsters.
Right?
Yeah.
And Lafe wrote back,
you know,</v>

611
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.090
he's like,
yeah,
I mean that was my motivation going through buds.

612
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.820
There's no way in.
And everyone kind of agreed.
Everyone was like,
yeah,

613
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:52.020
there's no way I was going to quit buds and go to a ship,

614
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.820
which is not exactly,
well,

615
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:56.340
if you have the personality where you think you want to go to buds than being on

616
00:35:56.341 --> 00:35:58.560
a ship is completely the opposite of that personality.

617
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.690
So I don't understand how a guy could be,
you know,
get,

618
00:36:03.691 --> 00:36:07.740
get to a point where they say,
you know what,
I don't want to be wet cold anymore.

619
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.550
Which is really all it is.
You know,
people get all excited about seal training,

620
00:36:11.551 --> 00:36:15.690
but you're wet and you're cold and you're tired.
Okay.
That's,
that's,

621
00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.140
that's not that big of a deal.
The pamphlet is 10% of the job.

622
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.160
Yeah.
Check.
Yeah.
So you get some people that did,

623
00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.760
I guess they don't really want to do it.

624
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.560
Everybody wants to be a frog man on a sunny day.
That's another,
a good sane.
So,

625
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.030
so you guys pushed up into Iraq?

626
00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.540
<v 2>Yeah.
So we,
we rolled up and the neat thing at the time was a,</v>

627
00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:39.330
it was madness was the,
was the,
you know,

628
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.990
he was the boss of a one mar div at the time.

629
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:47.991
So we rolled up with the First Marine Division linked up with the 13th or 15th

630
00:36:48.001 --> 00:36:51.900
mew and Naza Rhea.
They had taken some,
some heavies and answer.

631
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:56.640
He was a big fight.
And,
uh,
and so the,
the,
the word that we got,

632
00:36:56.641 --> 00:36:58.470
and I mean,
again,
you'd have to talk to,

633
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.620
to Harwood and madness if that's how it went down.

634
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:04.650
But basically we got Maddis called Harwood and was like,
hey,
you know,

635
00:37:04.651 --> 00:37:09.590
some of our supply routes and,
and convoys of been getting it handed to them and,

636
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.140
and some,
some routes and Naza Real,
you guys go ambush the ambush or,

637
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.080
and like Haley.
Yeah,
we will,
you know,
so,
uh,

638
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.220
it was like the wet dream of,
of,
uh,

639
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.900
of what you would think you're getting yourself into combat lies in terms of it

640
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:29.220
was,
you know,
hey,
our conventional guys are getting,
getting it taken to them.

641
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:34.440
Here is your,
your grid square basically.
Uh,
the,
it's you,
it's your territory.

642
00:37:34.441 --> 00:37:38.040
Let us know what we can do to help you,
you guys have at it.
And,
uh,

643
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.350
we had some leadership at the time that,
uh,

644
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.030
was not that crazy about cutting us off lead,
you know,
and,
uh,

645
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.990
so we battled it out with them and came up with some creative ways to go out and

646
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:51.690
work anyway.
But,
um,
but we just,
you know,

647
00:37:51.691 --> 00:37:54.420
we went out and did like old school,
you know,

648
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:57.720
conducting our own everything.
You know what I mean?
We,

649
00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.230
we gather our own intelligence.
We grabbed a few guys and,

650
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.500
and asked around and,
and,
uh,
you know,
did,

651
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:08.100
did several hits based on the intelligence that we've gathered and,
and,
uh,

652
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:12.420
had air support and it was kind of like a little microcosm of what was to come.

653
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.090
<v 3>But was that the first time you saw dogs and action?</v>

654
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.730
<v 2>No.
Okay.
Nope.
It wasn't until after that and it wasn't even seeing them.</v>

655
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:23.640
It was a hearing about them.
Uh,
which I'll get to in a,
in a second,
I guess.
But,

656
00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.350
uh,
so then as Maria thing,
we were there for a few weeks,
uh,
just doing our own,

657
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:33.360
doing our own thing basically.
And then we went up to,
uh,
southern Baghdad,

658
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:36.520
uh,
just south of Baghdad and were there for just a couple of days and we were in

659
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:40.540
northern Baghdad.
We hit a Scud base,
which was cool.
Um,
you know,

660
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.300
took a Scud base down and,
and uh,
got,

661
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:47.110
got some pretty neat photos and experiences from that,
from that.

662
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.730
But a trick down to Scott Pace.
Got Cool Pics.

663
00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:56.740
Yeah,
yeah.
I mean,
got the tee shirt.
Um,
so,
uh,

664
00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.210
so after that,
then we went up to,
to Crete.
And so this was,
you know,
again,

665
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:03.760
this was during the conventional phase,
so it was kind of,

666
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.960
to me the unique part about that was,
was kind of the best of both worlds.

667
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.670
And it was like having box seats at a,

668
00:39:09.671 --> 00:39:14.500
at a historic combat scene in terms of big conventional forces moving through.

669
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:19.800
You know,
there were,
there were lines,
you know,
everything.
Um,
and so,
you know,

670
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.350
I don't know if you remember the,
I think it was a third id.

671
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:25.990
He was supposed to come down through Turkey and in the last minute they said,
no,

672
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:27.360
you're not doing it.
So everything,
you know,

673
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:31.060
it was supposed to be meeting like that and in Baghdad with the,
you know,

674
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:34.680
the army and the Marines meeting south to north,
squeeze in Baghdad.

675
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.350
And it didn't happen.
Um,
you know,
last minute when they said,
no,

676
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:40.330
you can't run through here.
So it was just,
you know,

677
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:43.600
the marines moving south to north and,
and,
uh,

678
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.790
so we,
there was a couple of times where we'd go ahead of them and scout out some

679
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:52.770
routes and,
and uh,
got into a little bit of trouble a few times.
Um,

680
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:58.470
and then as we're coming up,
you know,
to create and,
and Mozal and,
uh,
you know,

681
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.710
tallow far and,
and uh,
you know,
some of the Curd Kurd areas up there,

682
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.970
they weren't real worried about to,

683
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:08.100
Crete was kind of the last big one that they were worried about being alas,
Dan,

684
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.550
cause it was Saddam's hometown,
whatever.

685
00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:14.070
And so the entire First Marine Division in seal team,
three Echo Platoon,
uh,

686
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.220
took down to Crete.
And,
uh,
it was funny because they're like,
you know,
um,

687
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.210
you know,
first first division has the West,
you know,
seconds got the north there,

688
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:25.460
has got the south and team three alcohol platoon.
You guys are taking these,

689
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:30.130
I can,
you know,
there's 16 of us in soft soft skinned Humvees,
right?
Yeah.

690
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:34.510
Whatever.
So we got it.
Yeah.
We went,
we went,
uh,
skirted,

691
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.410
skirted through town while,
while the entire town of,
you know,

692
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:42.220
25,000 Marines were taking down to Crete,
were sneaking our way up to,

693
00:40:42.221 --> 00:40:46.720
uh,
up to the palace and we took the palace down,
which is pretty,
pretty neat.

694
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.790
Um,
stayed there for a little while and then ended up,
once we left there,

695
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:55.240
we've kind of bounced around and went down,
back down to Baghdad and flew out.

696
00:40:55.241 --> 00:40:59.530
But,
but,
uh,
so while I was in to create a,

697
00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.820
that's where,
you know,
we had been in,

698
00:41:01.821 --> 00:41:06.821
in scenarios where the gist of it was that there was a group of marines that had

699
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.870
a dog with them.
And there was a,
in one of the,

700
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.890
the way I described it in the book was,
you know,
again,
it was hearing,
you know,

701
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:17.080
these guys are getting ready.
There was a little opening,

702
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.960
like a kind of a cave complex style opening in the side of a,

703
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:23.830
of a hill and they had a single purpose bomb dog with them.
Again from,

704
00:41:23.831 --> 00:41:28.780
this is all just what I heard.
Um,
and there was a,
um,
uh,

705
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:29.411
a grenade,

706
00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:34.070
booby trap basically had a clump of grenades just inside the doorway that,
um,

707
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.410
that uh,
this dog had alerted on,
you know,

708
00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:40.580
and for me that was like the slap in the face light switch moment of like,
why,

709
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.840
why do we not have dogs?
And I had grown up in Iowa with bird dogs.

710
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:47.000
I got into hog dogs for a number of years after,

711
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:51.110
which I'll get into the kind of what I drew from that in terms of heart

712
00:41:51.111 --> 00:41:55.280
intensity,
conditioning,
training,
nutrition,
breeding theory,
stuff like that.
But,

713
00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:00.020
um,
but,
you know,
I'd spent a number of years prior to that dealing with dogs,

714
00:42:00.021 --> 00:42:02.570
working with them,
training and stuff like that,
but never,
you know,

715
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.440
this focused and strategic about it,
calculated.
And so for me,

716
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:10.340
it was just from that day on,
back in March of o three,
up until as I sit here,

717
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:12.850
it was just like I couldn't get enough of it,
you know.
Um,

718
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:17.890
and I had taken a lot of the lessons I learned from training and reading and

719
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:22.580
working with dogs,
uh,
in a,
in a more informal capacity,
uh,

720
00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.570
and applied a lot of that stuff too,
to what,
what I had had,
uh,

721
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.170
started implementing with a,
with the canine programs and stuff.
And so for,

722
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.220
for that first five years,
it was just kind of,
you know,
a student.
I mean,

723
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:36.980
I'm still a student,
but,
um,
but it was just,
you know,

724
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.580
training with whoever I could train with.
I'd,
I would import dogs,
I would,

725
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.430
you know,
go to clubs.
I'd try to work with police departments,

726
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:45.920
anybody I could work with,
I would do it.
I'd read every book,

727
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:49.490
I could watch videos,
went to seminars,
you name it.
And,
uh,

728
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:54.320
and then as I transitioned to get ready to get out after I got a,
you know,

729
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.590
I came back,
was an instructor for a little while,
got valley fever and last,

730
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.920
you know,
40% of my lungs.
And,
and then,
uh,

731
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.300
as I was getting ready to get out,
I,

732
00:43:03.301 --> 00:43:07.460
I could either stay in and be a handler on the west coast or a start my own

733
00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:10.220
company and you know,
provide dog's training,

734
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:13.760
hand their courses and make a bigger impact.
And for me that was,
I think

735
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.490
<v 0>they just kind of breeze through the fact that you got valley fever as an</v>

736
00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:20.900
instructor.
It's 40% loss where you buy her long and it kills some people.

737
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.590
And that's,

738
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:25.610
that was obviously a huge piece of you saying because if you would've stayed in,

739
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.710
you,
you,
you weren't allowed to do anything that had any kind of lung irritants.

740
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:31.480
Was the deal.

741
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.070
<v 2>Yeah.
So,
uh,
so this was,
you know,
I came back and,
and,</v>

742
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.680
and it went right into being an instructor.
I had planned on,
you know,

743
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:43.960
forwarding on to bigger and better things,
uh,
operationally.

744
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:48.700
And,
um,
you know,
it,
I was out at Niland,
uh,

745
00:43:48.701 --> 00:43:52.660
and I all of a sudden,
just like any of us,
after you shoot a,
uh,

746
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.960
an 84 or a,
or a Gustaf round,
more than a couple of them,

747
00:43:55.961 --> 00:43:58.970
your chest a little tight the next day I was,
you know,

748
00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:02.410
the RSO during 55 of them being shot,
you know,

749
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.750
and so naturally like,
yeah,
my justice type,

750
00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:10.390
<v 0>that shouldn't be legal by the way as we found out.
So just so anyone knows,
uh,</v>

751
00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:15.610
uh,
a Carl Gustaf are on 84,
but especially a Carl Gustaf,
it's the biggest boom.

752
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.190
You're shooting a 84 millimeter rocket.

753
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:22.030
And if you shoot two of them or three of them in a day,
it's,

754
00:44:22.031 --> 00:44:24.100
it's like you got punched in the head a bunch.

755
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.850
But the problem is our instructor staff goes out there and they sit there and
do,

756
00:44:27.851 --> 00:44:31.590
what'd you say,
55 and five and 55 in one day.
That's not healthy bro.

757
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.440
<v 2>That is not healthy.
And it was one of those things like,
well,</v>

758
00:44:34.441 --> 00:44:37.080
you're not shooting them,
you're just standing there so it doesn't count.

759
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:41.460
And it's like,
okay,
you know,
a typical military genius,
you know.

760
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:43.650
But uh,
so the next day,
you know,

761
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.430
I expected my chest and lungs and head and everything to be a little,

762
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:49.740
a little sore than normal.
Um,

763
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.940
but it got worse and it got to the point where three or four days after that,

764
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:55.800
it was like,
it was debilitating,
you know,

765
00:44:55.801 --> 00:44:58.760
it felt like you were standing on my chest,
especially when I laid down,

766
00:44:58.761 --> 00:45:01.560
it got worse.
And so finally they said,
you know,
hey,

767
00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:03.840
you need to go to Bellville and,
and hit the,

768
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:08.130
hit the er and see what the hell is going on.
And so I went and,
uh,
it took,

769
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.110
you know,
based on,
and I can't blame bell boy,

770
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:14.730
like based on what I told them naturally they're assuming blast lung,
you know,

771
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.430
type type of issues,
you know,
some sort of,
you know,
uh,

772
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.230
explosive type of damage.
Um,
but it wasn't,
you know,

773
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.320
what that did is it exacerbated what,
what had already started,

774
00:45:25.321 --> 00:45:29.700
which was me having breathed in Koc city in my cosis,
which is a microscopic,

775
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.620
a fungus that lives in arid climates and it spreads through your lungs like mold

776
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.820
where it gets dangerous and kills people is,
um,
is two things.
One,

777
00:45:38.821 --> 00:45:42.120
your genetic makeup,
you predisposed to determine,
you know,
how,

778
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.890
how big of an impact it has.

779
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:48.720
The other one is how much you're exposed to and how long it goes untreated.
So,

780
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:53.970
um,
I basically,
it,
it grows through your,
your lungs like mold and spreads.

781
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:58.020
But if it,
if it goes past that,
if it disseminates past your lungs,

782
00:45:58.021 --> 00:46:01.570
then it goes into your,
into your blood and your organs and your bone.
Uh,

783
00:46:01.571 --> 00:46:03.200
and then ultimately it will get into your,

784
00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.480
your CSF fluid or cerebral spinal fluid.

785
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:08.640
And into your spinal cord and go up into your brain and in,

786
00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:10.140
and that's when it kills people.
And so it's,

787
00:46:10.141 --> 00:46:13.260
it's Kinda like encephalitis that way.
But,
um,

788
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.520
so mine had had disseminated pass my lungs,
there was a couple of hotspots in my,

789
00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:22.080
in my chest,
been my sternum and,
and uh,
in my chest,
bone,
ribs and whatever.

790
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.000
Um,
and so when they caught it,
they,
uh,
they prescribed Lamisil,
which,
uh,

791
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:31.560
is a toenail fungus medication.
But uh,
or no,
I'm sorry,
die flu can,

792
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.780
but it's,
it's a lot harsher than,
than,
um,
Lamis hills,
fluconazole.

793
00:46:36.781 --> 00:46:38.910
And so they,
long story short,

794
00:46:38.911 --> 00:46:42.000
I was on 28 times the amount that you would be prescribed for,

795
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:46.860
for a bad case of toenail fungus.
And I got down.
So here's the,
the irony.

796
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:52.320
I had gotten up to 200 pounds prior to that.
Uh,
and then I got back down.
I wait,

797
00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.400
wait 140 pounds at the end of it,
I was on convalescent leave for eight months.

798
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.900
Uh,
at the time my,
my chief was ty woods.
Um,
you know,

799
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:04.950
from the Ghazi God rest his soul.
Awesome dude.
But,
uh,

800
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:07.940
so I was working for him at the time and,
and he,
you know,

801
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.860
just couldn't have been better.
I mean,
he,
he checked on me,

802
00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:14.490
came by the house regularly.
I mean,
um,
you know,
I mean,

803
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:16.920
I couldn't do anything like I slept 20 hours a day.

804
00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:21.090
It was like having pneumonia in mono at the same time,
lost a ton of weight.
Um,

805
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.810
got down to about one 40.
Finally,
they had gotten the,
um,

806
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.600
the disease under control and got it to a,

807
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:32.450
to recede,
but it lays in your bloodstream,

808
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.810
like malaria does or whatever it,
it lays dormant.

809
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:39.430
So if I got pneumonia or a leukemia or HIV or cancer or something that really

810
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.690
immunosuppressed me,
it could come back.
And so that's,
it's always there.

811
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.860
You always have antibodies there.
But,
uh,
so,
uh,
at the end of that,

812
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:52.260
the infectious disease captain at Balboa sat me down.
He's like,
you know,
um,

813
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.630
I would recommend a medical retirement for you right now.
And he said,

814
00:47:55.631 --> 00:47:59.100
if you want to go that route,
I'm not saying you have to,
but,
uh,
but,
uh,

815
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.820
that's what I recommend.
And,
and,
uh,
you know,

816
00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:05.350
he basically let me know what you want to do.
And I was like,
man,
I,
you know,

817
00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:09.040
I've got a child on my first child on the way.
I have no college degree.

818
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:13.180
I had just totally caught me off guard.
Like I have no plan,
you know.
Um,

819
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.500
and so I said,
well,
you know,
how,
how can I stay in,
you know,
he said,
well,

820
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:21.130
you got to stay away from,
from lung irritants for a few years.
Honestly,

821
00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:23.920
he's like,
to make as good a recovery is you're going to make,

822
00:48:23.921 --> 00:48:27.100
you've got to slowly get back into shape and put weight on.

823
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.820
You got to take really good care of your lungs.

824
00:48:28.821 --> 00:48:32.710
And me stay away from harsh cleaning products,
smoke,
you know,
dust,
everything,

825
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.510
which is basically everything you do as a seal.
Yeah.
I mean,

826
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:39.910
every thing that you do,
your cleaning stuff,
your bone stuff up,

827
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:41.530
you're setting stuff on fire,

828
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:46.510
you're shooting guns with led and it's just a disaster for your lungs.
And so,

829
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:50.650
you know,
really the only potentially logical xsplit era,
you know,

830
00:48:50.651 --> 00:48:54.820
choice was to go over to,
uh,
to the center as a basic,
you know,
bud's instructor.

831
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.740
And so,
ah,
Bro,
the,
the master chief that was,
that was working for at the time,
uh,

832
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.560
you know,
can't,
can't say enough good things about him.

833
00:49:02.561 --> 00:49:04.840
He hooked me up and made a deal with it,

834
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.990
with the training master chief and they sent me over there and I spent three

835
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:12.430
years there,
which,
you know,
was an amazing experience too.
And,

836
00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:15.480
and I honestly,
I've drawn a lot of lessons,
uh,

837
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.670
from being an instructor to both life and to training dogs,

838
00:49:18.671 --> 00:49:21.910
which I know we'll get into,
but,
um,
you know,

839
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:26.010
so it was neat to be behind the curtain air for a little while and see,

840
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.580
see what the wizard's us,
so to speak.
Uh,
but,
you know,
then when I,
like I said,
I,

841
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:34.420
as I was there,
I started,
that's when the West Coast Canine program was,

842
00:49:34.421 --> 00:49:39.250
was coming up online oh seven,
oh eight timeframe.
Um,
and,
uh,

843
00:49:39.251 --> 00:49:43.400
and I went and did,
uh,
did some decoys training with some of their guys,
uh,

844
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.900
up at a vendor they were using up in central California,

845
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:49.930
and as almost kind of like a working interview,
basically if,
Hey,

846
00:49:49.931 --> 00:49:52.360
is this something you want to get involved with?
And I was like,
yeah,
absolutely.

847
00:49:52.361 --> 00:49:55.540
And so they basically,
I was at a crossroads.
I said,
you know,

848
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:58.600
if you want to re enlist and whatever,
you know,
you can come,

849
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:03.730
come be a handler here.
Um,
you know,
or that's it,
you know,
and,
uh,

850
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.070
I thought about it for awhile and,
and for me,
you know,

851
00:50:06.071 --> 00:50:10.100
it's one of those forks in the road that there isn't a right answer.
You know,

852
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.610
I wouldn't be where I'm at today.
Uh,
but I'd be,

853
00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.450
I'd be lying to you if I said there isn't part of me that wishes I had stayed
in.

854
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:21.970
I'd still be in doing deployments as a handler.
I'm,
I'm sure you know.
So,
um,

855
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.360
but for me again,
just kind of back to like when I first joined the navy,

856
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:28.010
I've always looked at it as how can I make a impact,
not,

857
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.160
not what do I want most personally,
but what,

858
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.410
what's going to make a more of an impact in terms of,
of the industry and,

859
00:50:35.411 --> 00:50:39.380
and helping more people.
And to me it just made sense.
If I can sell,
you know,

860
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:43.800
lots of dogs and,
and provide handler training and run courses and,

861
00:50:43.801 --> 00:50:46.550
and source nice dogs to feed the program and all that,

862
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:49.650
then then that makes more sense from a big picture standpoint.

863
00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:54.310
<v 3>Did you ever get connected with any of the Vietnam era dog handlers?</v>

864
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.420
<v 2>I did.
A team guy actually.</v>

865
00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.950
<v 3>Yeah.
Like do you ever hear stories about Prince Prince?</v>

866
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.530
Prince was like the,
the uh,

867
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:08.650
I believe was the most successfully used dog in Vietnam by the seals,

868
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.960
was a dog named Prince.
I,
I heard stories when I first got in about Princeton.

869
00:51:13.961 --> 00:51:18.200
And one of the stories that I heard,
and again this is the story of,

870
00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.330
it's an oral tradition that's been passed down,

871
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:25.000
but the story was that there was guys that were getting extracted on a

872
00:51:25.001 --> 00:51:29.330
helicopter and that they all piled,
it was a hot extract.

873
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:33.660
They are all the guys pile into the bird and they've got prince the dog with

874
00:51:33.661 --> 00:51:37.220
them and the guy says,
uh,
you know,
hey,

875
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.430
we're too heavy to take off.
Somebody got to get out.

876
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:44.630
And this is the air crewman looks at,
looks the looks of the chief and says,
Hey,

877
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.980
we're too heavy to take off.

878
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:50.570
Somebody's got to get out and looks at the guy and looks at prince like get the

879
00:51:50.571 --> 00:51:51.950
dog out of here.
We've got to take off.

880
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.280
And the story goes that the handlers seal handler like put his hand on on the

881
00:51:57.441 --> 00:52:00.560
dog and was like,
none of us are going anywhere.

882
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:05.570
And they had to just crank the engines and real barely be able to take off.

883
00:52:05.571 --> 00:52:07.250
But that was the,
that was the,

884
00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.610
the story that I heard about and there's pictures of prince you can see in the

885
00:52:10.611 --> 00:52:11.444
archives.

886
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:14.450
So I was just wondering if you ever talk to any of the guys that were any of the

887
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:15.500
prints handlers?

888
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:19.180
<v 2>Uh,
not,
not that I'm aware of.
There's,
there was a guy and,
and you know,</v>

889
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.090
I actually never talked to him about what his dog's name was.

890
00:52:22.091 --> 00:52:24.220
I'm sure if it was him,
he probably would have told me,
but there was,

891
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.230
I think he was the first Vietnam Seal Canine handler that I talked to you right

892
00:52:29.231 --> 00:52:34.060
as my first book came out and send them a signed copy and uh,
you know,

893
00:52:34.061 --> 00:52:36.280
talk to them a little bit as I was,
as it was coming out,

894
00:52:36.281 --> 00:52:39.500
which was for me just to,
it was an awesome experience,
you know,

895
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:42.910
like hearing this guy talk,
like it was basically like,
here's a dog,

896
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:45.280
figure it out.
You know?
I mean that's about the gist of it.

897
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.050
<v 3>Apparently they had some hard times the fruit,</v>

898
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:48.500
they didn't know what they were doing.
Yeah.

899
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.830
And I took a couple of deployments before they figured out okay.

900
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:55.430
And they got the dog prints up to speed and apparently he saved a bunch of guys

901
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:55.640
over over

902
00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.550
<v 2>time.
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

903
00:52:56.551 --> 00:53:00.030
he had some pretty interesting things to say about the program and the efficacy

904
00:53:00.031 --> 00:53:01.710
of the dogs back then.
And yeah,

905
00:53:01.711 --> 00:53:04.290
I mean a lot of it was them just kind of working their way through it.

906
00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:08.520
And that's the thing that,
that I think most people,
um,
pro,

907
00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.110
there's probably the biggest misrepresentation of,

908
00:53:11.111 --> 00:53:15.990
of canine programs is that it's not a weapon system.
You know,
where it's like,

909
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.990
okay,
your mark one motto team Guy,
like you'll figure it out.

910
00:53:18.991 --> 00:53:22.950
Like it's a totally different animal,
no pun intended.
It is.
I mean,
like,
you know,

911
00:53:22.951 --> 00:53:26.100
the,
the podcast you did,
uh,
with the sacs,

912
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:29.210
right when he's talking about horses and it takes 10 years.
It's,

913
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.960
it's that way with dogs.
It really is.
I mean,
because it's,

914
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:36.870
it's a totally different deal.
Uh,
it takes years to get truly,

915
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:40.950
you know,
I would say that too,
to be able to master,
you know,

916
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:44.880
what it takes to implement a dog program.
It's,
it's,
it's a kin to flip it on,
uh,

917
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.850
uh,
another detachment or saying,
hey,

918
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:50.430
we're going to create a female special forces unit.
Like,

919
00:53:50.431 --> 00:53:52.110
it's going to take a long time before that.

920
00:53:52.111 --> 00:53:54.720
That's up and running and dog programs are very similar that way.

921
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:59.280
So it's hard enough when you've got training,
cadre,
resources,
you know,

922
00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:03.780
budgeting,
building,
all that stuff in your favorites.
Still take several years,

923
00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:07.500
you know,
to just say,
here's the dog,
figure it out.
Like math.
That's a,

924
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:10.470
that's a tough pill to swallow.
Those guys did it,
you know,
just like,

925
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:11.580
just like any of us,

926
00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:15.840
<v 3>you know.
Well we'll figure it out,
but,
well,
all right,
let's,
let's,</v>

927
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.680
let's get into the book a little bit cause I think that'll just guide us.
Um,

928
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:23.850
cause I had a great time reading this book.
Um,
as you know,
I have a dog as well,

929
00:54:23.851 --> 00:54:27.250
which is man is man biter.
Yeah.
Uh,

930
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:31.710
but the book that I decided to go with,
you got three books out.

931
00:54:31.711 --> 00:54:34.800
Obviously the,
the,
the seal team dog is like book more.
It's a,

932
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:38.340
what they call in the,
in the literary industry.

933
00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:41.250
It's a why a book for young adults,
right?
That's what it is.
Yeah.

934
00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:41.821
<v 2>Well,
yeah,
it's,</v>

935
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:46.000
it's actually a navy seal dogs is the young adult adaptation of trying to keep

936
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:47.440
[inaudible] so it's the same,
same

937
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:51.090
<v 3>same book.
So don't buy that one if you're an adult,
you don't get both of them.</v>

938
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.910
Don't get both of them.
But then this book team dog,

939
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.680
how to train your dog and ABC away in Wa,
but we'll reason and he,
as soon as I,

940
00:54:57.681 --> 00:54:59.610
as soon as you got here today,
you're like,
you know,

941
00:54:59.611 --> 00:55:02.880
I just got listened to the last podcast with de sacs and there's so many

942
00:55:02.881 --> 00:55:05.970
parallels.
You'd be surprised.
And I was like,
he's like,

943
00:55:05.971 --> 00:55:08.460
are we going to talk about that?
I'm like,
of course we are,
because that's,

944
00:55:08.461 --> 00:55:13.461
there's so many parallels between how you lead a dog and how you lead a human.

945
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:18.570
As awful as that might sound,
it's absolutely true.
100%.
Uh,

946
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:20.850
one of the things you kick off here and,

947
00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:23.970
and I kind of skipped to the middle of the book because it's talking about

948
00:55:23.971 --> 00:55:27.120
selection.
So I'm going to go to the book here.
Selection is crucial.

949
00:55:27.121 --> 00:55:29.310
I can't emphasize this poison that point enough.

950
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:33.720
In most cases when I've been asked to intervene in problem dog situations,

951
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.900
what I instantly see as Mitch Matt mismatch such as either a slightly built

952
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:43.971
person or an elderly couple who have a 75 pound high energy dog who they can't

953
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:46.260
walk without being dragged along.

954
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:50.490
Those people are physically incapable of exerting enough force to stop that dog

955
00:55:50.491 --> 00:55:55.491
for moving unnecessary first step in getting a dog to walk properly on a leash.

956
00:55:55.830 --> 00:56:00.210
That's just one example of how better selection could have resulted in a better

957
00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:03.840
relationship and again,
that's a real obvious one.

958
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:05.250
That's one of the easiest ones to understand,
oh,

959
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:09.030
I'm a small old woman and I can't get a hundred pound dog to drag me around,

960
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.920
but there's a lot of,
a lot of other characteristics that are way more nuanced.

961
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.000
For instance,

962
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:20.280
a dog that is super high energy and you're a working person that's busy all the

963
00:56:20.281 --> 00:56:20.491
time.

964
00:56:20.491 --> 00:56:22.470
You got to work when you're home and you're going to have that dog nipping at

965
00:56:22.471 --> 00:56:24.400
you all the time.
Play me,
play with me,
play with me,
play with me.

966
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.340
That's not going to be a good match.
That's not going to be a good match at all.

967
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:30.070
Um,
and,
and you see,

968
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:34.780
well you were quoting some of the quotes,
uh,
about,
I mean,

969
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:39.130
tell me a little bit about dog ownership in America right now because I think a

970
00:56:39.131 --> 00:56:41.920
lot of it selection has a lot to do with where we ended up with problems.

971
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:45.960
<v 2>So there's two things really.
I mean,
dog ownership as a whole is a,</v>

972
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:50.410
it's a goat rope,
honestly.
And that's where this book stems from.
That's where my,

973
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.470
my team dog online training programs stems from.
And frankly,
the,

974
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:56.300
the campaign that,
that the,

975
00:56:56.310 --> 00:57:01.290
I'm about to launch that that is in essence the crux of the problem with,

976
00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.800
uh,
with dog ownership in this country is that it's,

977
00:57:03.801 --> 00:57:08.460
it's mismatched a poor selection.
And,
and most importantly,

978
00:57:08.461 --> 00:57:13.230
it's just a,
an inability to communicate properly with the dog.
Uh,
and,
and,

979
00:57:13.231 --> 00:57:17.570
and what that stems from is very simply as that,
you know,
dogs minds.
Um,

980
00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:22.590
if,
if you think about it from,
from the most basic standpoint,
you can,
is that,

981
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.820
you know,
you were having this conversation verbally,
right?
You,

982
00:57:26.821 --> 00:57:30.580
your dream in a language.
We're talking a language you think in a language.
Uh,

983
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:33.120
we communicate overwhelmingly verbally.

984
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:37.350
Now when you think about about dogs,
is that just something as simple as,

985
00:57:37.351 --> 00:57:39.410
as you and I meeting?
Uh,
if,

986
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:42.100
if I come over and I shake your hand and we smile and nod,
you know,

987
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:44.130
touch your shoulder or whatever,
walk away.

988
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.110
If somebody can see that from across the parking lot and no.
Yeah,

989
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.870
it was a cordial,
cordial greeting.

990
00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.110
You and I stand up next to each other and we're looking at each other like this

991
00:57:52.111 --> 00:57:56.100
and doing this kind of stuff and sizing each other up and turn around again from

992
00:57:56.101 --> 00:57:59.550
across the parking lot.
You know,
there's two dudes are about to brawl now,

993
00:57:59.551 --> 00:58:03.780
if it's that easy for us as human beings who are overwhelmingly verbal and how

994
00:58:03.781 --> 00:58:05.790
we communicate to,
to pick that thing up.

995
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:09.620
Now imagine a dog who's never thought in a language,
uh,

996
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.330
who doesn't dream in a language,
doesn't communicate in a language.
Now,

997
00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:17.310
now think about how important body language and nonverbal verbal communication

998
00:58:17.311 --> 00:58:21.600
skills are.
It's everything to a dog.
And so their,
their mind,
uh,

999
00:58:21.601 --> 00:58:26.250
is an algorithm.
It works like a calculator.
It doesn't work like,
like our minds.

1000
00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:26.551
And that's,

1001
00:58:26.551 --> 00:58:31.200
that's the biggest single crucial element where people make the mistakes is the

1002
00:58:31.201 --> 00:58:35.850
anthropomorphize and they attach all these human associations,
emotions,

1003
00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.960
logic and reasoning to a dog's brain.
And it doesn't work that way.
You know,
the,

1004
00:58:39.961 --> 00:58:42.370
the a plus B equals c,
you know,

1005
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:46.380
the scientific jargon is antecedent plus behavior equals consequence.

1006
00:58:46.381 --> 00:58:50.610
But just think of it like a calculator is that grabbing the leash plus putting

1007
00:58:50.611 --> 00:58:52.590
it on,
you know,
grabbing the leash a plus,

1008
00:58:52.591 --> 00:58:54.660
putting it on B equals we go for a walk.

1009
00:58:54.661 --> 00:58:59.661
See when a plus B is paired enough times to where dog anticipates,

1010
00:59:00.001 --> 00:59:02.880
see that's when you have problems.
How many people have you seen,
you know,

1011
00:59:02.881 --> 00:59:05.460
that have a dog that they grabbed the leash and he's just,
you know,

1012
00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:08.670
spinning around the moon and they can't even get a leash on him to take him for

1013
00:59:08.671 --> 00:59:09.930
a walk,
let alone settle down.

1014
00:59:09.931 --> 00:59:13.770
That's why is because every single time you've paired a plus B,

1015
00:59:13.771 --> 00:59:17.550
it's equaled c and now he's anticipating when a,
and he's anticipating,

1016
00:59:17.551 --> 00:59:19.560
see when a and B are present.

1017
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.240
So something as simple as breaking context gets rid of that.

1018
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:25.690
You know a lot of people,
let's put a prong collar on,
it was putting an equal,

1019
00:59:25.691 --> 00:59:28.610
it's a Niamh and the ribs,
let's manhandle him all these things.

1020
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.300
All you have to do is break that context,
you know,
and,

1021
00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:32.900
and it's really that simple as that.

1022
00:59:32.901 --> 00:59:35.900
Whether you're trying to build it or whether you're trying to break it,

1023
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.640
the process is the exact same.

1024
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:41.060
You're either going to make a plus B equals c enough times to where you want

1025
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:44.750
them to anticipate it.
Or if c is something you don't want anticipated,

1026
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:48.470
you're going to make a plus B not equal.
It's so with Alicia example,
it's,

1027
00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:50.750
I go grab the leash,
I click it,
I wrap it around my waist,

1028
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:53.990
I go sit down on the couch with it and now the dog is looking at you like his

1029
00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:57.280
mind's blown.
He's like,
what the hell is going on?
We're,

1030
00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.180
we're supposed to be walking right now.
And then I get up,

1031
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:01.250
I put it back and I go sit down and go about my day.

1032
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:03.940
You do that enough times and now when you grabbed the leash,

1033
01:00:03.941 --> 01:00:07.490
he doesn't mean anything to them.
Uh,
so just as one simple example,

1034
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:11.930
if you think about all of these different behaviors that we as human beings

1035
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:15.870
inadvertently create a in the animal that that is why is it's a,

1036
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.460
it's a lack of that understanding that their mind just works differently than

1037
01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:24.230
ours.
As soon as you understand that coupled with presence,
you know,

1038
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.010
I know you,
you have to speak about this in,
in your,
in your business leadership,

1039
01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:30.920
uh,
conferences in,
in how you carry yourself,

1040
01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:34.700
how you interact with people is huge.
You know,
and if it's,
again,

1041
01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:38.240
if it's that big with people,
I mean,
you know,
you're the type of guy that,

1042
01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:40.280
you know,
you walk into a room,
people are like,
this dude's running,

1043
01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:43.010
running the show.
Right?
Um,
a lot of people,
you know,

1044
01:00:43.011 --> 01:00:46.430
that we've worked with or worked for our like that just command respect by the

1045
01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:50.030
way they carry themselves by the way they walk in.
And if it's,
again,

1046
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:53.600
if it's that effective just with us as human beings who aren't driven that way

1047
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:58.480
primarily.
Now imagine a dog like a,
I do exercise of dogs all the time is right.

1048
01:00:58.481 --> 01:01:01.010
I don't say a word to him.
It'd be the first time I've ever seen a dog.

1049
01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:05.000
I'll put a three foot leash on them in a room with basically nothing in it.

1050
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.370
And this is a dog that,
you know,
they've had all these problems with.

1051
01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:11.270
It's a nine month old,
crazy high energy dog.
Um,

1052
01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:14.630
I did it just the other day actually on the,
on the trip I was on before this,

1053
01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:17.960
this training facility was having trouble with this dog and they wanted to go
to,

1054
01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:20.750
to using some,
some compulsion methods,
some,

1055
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:24.050
some prong collar and blue collar stuff to,
to get the dog under control.
I said,

1056
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:27.650
let me,
let me mess with them for a minute.
So I connect the leash to them.

1057
01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.810
I walk around with them and it just,
you know,

1058
01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:33.380
talking on deletion and feeling him,
you know,
getting a feel for his personality.

1059
01:01:33.381 --> 01:01:36.990
But you know,
if you think of it like a,
like a bumper or a,

1060
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.300
a buffer is that you're,
you're the buffer between that dog,
his mind and,
and,

1061
01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:44.480
and the stimuli and everything that goes between your,

1062
01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:47.060
you're almost the gatekeeper.
Uh,
and so when you,

1063
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:51.230
you have to get inside that dog's mind and be able to reach it first,
you know,

1064
01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:55.520
which,
which means I have to mirror what I want out of the dog.
If he's a spazz,

1065
01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.860
I can't treat him like a spazz.

1066
01:01:57.861 --> 01:02:01.220
I can't spazz out and yank him and yell at them and,
and get all,

1067
01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:04.790
all up in his grill about it.
I need to throttle it down and,
and,

1068
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:09.290
and be a mirror or a representation of physical representation of what I want

1069
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:14.180
out of him.
And so it got to the point where I finally got him to just relax,

1070
01:02:14.181 --> 01:02:16.240
lay down,
and I could get up and walk around the room and he,

1071
01:02:16.241 --> 01:02:19.170
and he wouldn't move.
And he had not done that before.
And it's not,

1072
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:22.440
it's not anything crazy magic wizard stuff.

1073
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.610
It's just a basic understanding of,
of canine psychology,

1074
01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:30.900
operant conditioning.
And the four quadrants,
uh,
but,
but most importantly,
it's,

1075
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:33.780
it's that nonverbal communication aspect that a,

1076
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:35.730
that with dogs is just imperative.

1077
01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.800
<v 0>Um,
when you,
uh,</v>

1078
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:41.910
the other thing that before we move on past selection or we get a little bit

1079
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:45.780
more,
but a lot of times people figured they want certain breed of dog.
Right?

1080
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.820
And I had a great conversation.
You wouldn't,

1081
01:02:47.821 --> 01:02:51.750
when I was getting a dog a while back and you were like,
look,

1082
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.370
you could have a great dog that's a month.

1083
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.610
You could have a great dog that's pure bread,
whatever you name it.

1084
01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.720
You could have a horrible dog that's a Mutt and you can have a horrible dog

1085
01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:03.660
that's a pure bred,
whatever you want to name it.
Or whenever that breed is,

1086
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.160
there's the,
the,
the,
the breed that you get.

1087
01:03:08.161 --> 01:03:11.310
Obviously you got to look at how big it's going to be and what kind of

1088
01:03:11.311 --> 01:03:13.950
temperament.
Put the temperament thing,
how,

1089
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:18.030
how well is that temperament thing and how much,
how much impact does that,

1090
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:20.230
does the breed and the temperament align?

1091
01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.010
<v 2>So I would say that there's,
there's basically two categories.</v>

1092
01:03:24.011 --> 01:03:25.360
There's the working varieties.

1093
01:03:25.361 --> 01:03:29.110
And the non working varieties when it comes to nonworking varieties and other

1094
01:03:29.111 --> 01:03:32.530
words,
your average domesticated house pet,
honestly it's,

1095
01:03:32.531 --> 01:03:37.300
it's a paint job and in my opinion,
uh,
breed really is what do you like,

1096
01:03:37.301 --> 01:03:40.250
what do you like,
what,
what does,
what does it look like and what do you like?
Uh,

1097
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.230
it's purely aesthetic or almost that way.
Uh,

1098
01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.300
because they are bred for aesthetics.
They're not bred for working,

1099
01:03:46.301 --> 01:03:47.140
working traits don't,

1100
01:03:47.141 --> 01:03:51.370
you're talking about mountain was shepherds Cata Hulu is coon dogs,
you know,

1101
01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:53.800
Terry or types rat,
terrorist pattern sales,
whatever.

1102
01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:58.690
Any type of dog that was bred purposefully.
Now it is a different ball game.

1103
01:03:58.691 --> 01:04:02.920
Now I would say that,
you know,
most mountain was as an example.
Uh,
you know,

1104
01:04:02.921 --> 01:04:04.960
do have a higher level of energy,

1105
01:04:04.961 --> 01:04:08.010
a higher drive that doesn't necessarily translate to good driving.

1106
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:13.020
A lot of people make the mis mis conception that now my dog has tons of energy.

1107
01:04:13.151 --> 01:04:16.330
He just needs a job.
He needs to work.
And He'd be a great working dog.

1108
01:04:16.331 --> 01:04:20.320
Not necessarily,
you know,
it could be nervous energy,
it could be anxiousness.
Uh,

1109
01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:23.260
could be thin environmental nerves.
There's a lot of different reasons.

1110
01:04:23.261 --> 01:04:27.820
But back to your,
your question is that from a selection standpoint,

1111
01:04:27.821 --> 01:04:31.480
you know the,
if you're talking about any breed that you're just getting,

1112
01:04:31.481 --> 01:04:35.190
it's an Akc dog or,
or even a shelter dog or whatever.
That's,

1113
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:39.340
that's not bread from three,
four,
five generations of lineage that's,

1114
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.120
that's been selected because it brings certain working traits to the table.

1115
01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:48.130
It's a good dog is where you find it.
You know,
it really is.
I mean it's,

1116
01:04:48.131 --> 01:04:50.530
it's one of the parents,
like if it's out of a shelter,

1117
01:04:50.531 --> 01:04:53.280
just go evaluate the dog with the same tips that,
that I gave you.

1118
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.020
I want to say it and I do that.
I don't care where the dog's coming from.

1119
01:04:56.410 --> 01:05:00.490
It could be the best bread dog from the most pipe hit or rich parents I've ever

1120
01:05:00.491 --> 01:05:03.970
come across.
I'm still going to evaluate that dog with,
with,
uh,

1121
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.120
zero Kennel blindedness with no bias whatsoever.

1122
01:05:07.121 --> 01:05:10.150
I don't care if it's a friend of mine,
I don't care if it's puppies.
I raised,
I,

1123
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.830
I wash out puppies that I,

1124
01:05:11.831 --> 01:05:14.830
I breathed and raise all the time because they're just not what I need.

1125
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:19.810
And that's from a selection to tie in the seal teams and having been an

1126
01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:22.660
instructor there.
The reason I think that not,

1127
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:26.560
I think the reason that that the caliber of individual that shows up at a seal

1128
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:30.850
team is,
is so high is because buds is such a tough selection process.

1129
01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.650
<v 3>I asked her the other day,
like,
people ask me what you know,</v>

1130
01:05:34.651 --> 01:05:39.380
did you learn how to deal with stress?
Did you learn in buds?

1131
01:05:39.381 --> 01:05:42.890
And I'm like,
no,
you don't actually learn that.
You just,
if you can't,
you go away.

1132
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.410
They don't,
there's not a class where they say,
okay,

1133
01:05:45.411 --> 01:05:47.600
when you start feeling stressed,
here's what you do.

1134
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:49.670
Or when you start feeling like you can't go any further,

1135
01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:52.700
we want you to repeat this mantra.
I don't know.
They don't do that.

1136
01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:56.660
They just put you in crappy situations and if you want to quit,
you quit.

1137
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:58.100
There's no education there.

1138
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.580
I think the only education that exists as you learn who you are,

1139
01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.960
that's a good point.
But no one teaches,
you know,
I mean it's the,
I guess,

1140
01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:08.800
I guess the,
the environment is what teaches you that.
The,

1141
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:12.380
another good thing you wrote in here and you just talked about a little bit,

1142
01:06:12.381 --> 01:06:16.490
dogs are meant to be active and are happiest when they're doing something.

1143
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.940
And the reason I highlighted that one,
cause it's the same thing with people to,

1144
01:06:19.941 --> 01:06:22.010
same thing I've been talking about with Joe Rogan is the same thing I've been

1145
01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:24.950
talking about with Jordan Peterson.
You know,
with Joe Rogan,
we were saying that,

1146
01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:25.280
you know,

1147
01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.210
you need some kind of a struggle to make you feel like you're accomplishing

1148
01:06:29.211 --> 01:06:32.780
something with Jordan Peterson.
It's,
you know,
we talk about to Al,

1149
01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:36.920
if you take up the burden of responsibility,
that's what gives you a purpose.

1150
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:39.440
And so for dogs,

1151
01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.200
if you're just gonna let your dog dog run around and do whatever he wants,

1152
01:06:42.201 --> 01:06:44.570
well he's not really going to be happy.
Is that the point?

1153
01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:49.620
<v 2>It is.
And here is a,
I would say classic example of,
of us as humans,</v>

1154
01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.580
uh,
anthropomorphizing certain elements to dogs.
By that I mean that we,

1155
01:06:54.581 --> 01:06:58.410
we look at it as a job,
as purpose,
right?
Again,

1156
01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:02.940
this is my opinion.
I'm not a world renowned,
a canine psychologist,
but,

1157
01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:07.230
but I play one on TV.
Uh,
but you know,
the,
the fact is is that,
you know,

1158
01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:09.330
dogs I don't think have that,

1159
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:13.250
that depth of understanding of purpose they have,
what I would,

1160
01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.880
I would classify it as,
you know,

1161
01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:19.440
like a five year old is they have a need to be stimulated physically,
mentally,

1162
01:07:19.441 --> 01:07:22.440
emotionally,
socially,
nutritionally,
everything.

1163
01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:25.260
Just like we as human beings and where you see problems,

1164
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:28.650
and I see it all the time with my online dog training is that,
you know,

1165
01:07:28.651 --> 01:07:32.430
when people first start out,
it's,
it's kind of a reeducation of sorts of,

1166
01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:33.780
of saying,
you know,
number one,

1167
01:07:33.781 --> 01:07:36.270
you've got to put yourself in the dog shoes and I'm going to help you doing it

1168
01:07:36.271 --> 01:07:37.350
by structuring these,

1169
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:41.280
these monthly lessons so that they're cumulative so that you can understand and

1170
01:07:41.281 --> 01:07:45.480
watch your dog transform and learn from it.
But what it is,
is that it's,

1171
01:07:45.481 --> 01:07:48.090
it's making an understanding.
It's just like with people is that,
you know,

1172
01:07:48.091 --> 01:07:51.600
that dog needs to have physical exercise as part of his daily regimen.

1173
01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:53.520
He used to have routine so that,

1174
01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:58.020
so that he can count on you and depend on you for providing the resources that

1175
01:07:58.021 --> 01:07:59.340
necessitates his life.

1176
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.570
He's got to have a mental stimulation just like we do.
I mean,

1177
01:08:03.571 --> 01:08:05.190
you can do nothing but work out,

1178
01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:09.060
but think about the difference between a gym workout and a Jujitsu role in terms

1179
01:08:09.061 --> 01:08:11.550
of what it does for your mind.
Like it's night and day difference.

1180
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:16.700
And so you can't just go make your dog blow his physical every day playing ball

1181
01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:18.740
like you.
You've got to make his mind work.

1182
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:22.140
And that's where using a clicker to reinforce in shape,
uh,

1183
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.650
behaviors comes into play because now they have to think,

1184
01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:27.320
they have to figure things out.
Uh,
and it is,
it's,
it's,

1185
01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:31.500
it's mentally exhausting or at a minimum stimulating,
and they require that.
Uh,

1186
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:35.720
same with food.
Same with sunlight,
you know,
is that if,
imagine you sit in here,

1187
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:39.680
you know,
23 hours a day or,
or you don't go outside,
you don't roll,

1188
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:43.400
you eat beef jerky and canned goods or Mcdonald's,
um,
you know,

1189
01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.530
do that week after week after week,
where are you going to be?
You know,

1190
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:49.910
across the board,
physically,
mentally,
health wise,
immune system,

1191
01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:53.870
everything's going to be garbage.
And so what happens is a lot of these people,

1192
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.940
they think they're,
you know,
spoiling their dog.

1193
01:08:55.941 --> 01:09:00.080
I don't know when that became a positive thing.
Uh,
but,
um,
but you know,

1194
01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:03.740
they think that,
you know,
by not making them do things,
not teaching him things,

1195
01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:08.630
not enforcing things,
not having a routine in which that dog can depend on,
um,

1196
01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:09.980
not stimulating his mind,

1197
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:13.130
not making sure that he's physically active and keeping them in good shape,

1198
01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:15.110
that those are all benefits and they're not

1199
01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:17.690
<v 0>the detriments.
You know,
needless to say,</v>

1200
01:09:17.691 --> 01:09:22.010
this applies directly to your kids and how you're raised.
You guys,
you just,

1201
01:09:22.011 --> 01:09:25.100
everything you just rattled off is basically how you end up with spoiled kids

1202
01:09:25.101 --> 01:09:29.490
that are lazy and unproductive in their lives.
100%,
you know,
and,

1203
01:09:29.491 --> 01:09:30.770
and by the way,
lazy,

1204
01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:33.530
unproductive and unhappy because they're not going to be happy when they're a

1205
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:35.840
loser sitting around playing video games,
you know,

1206
01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:39.710
23 hours a day covered in cheeto dust.
That's my favorite.

1207
01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:41.620
The one of the things that I think,
I think

1208
01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.381
<v 2>that,
uh,
is,</v>

1209
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:46.630
is really interesting to me of how dog training kind of relates to life is that

1210
01:09:46.631 --> 01:09:49.380
it's,
it's,
it's like a petri dish or,

1211
01:09:49.381 --> 01:09:54.381
or almost a microcosm of life is that no different than whether it's business

1212
01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:59.380
relationship goals,
leadership,
a coach with his athletes,
a teacher with students,

1213
01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.790
parents with their kids,
you name it.
Uh,
but you know,
a,

1214
01:10:02.791 --> 01:10:06.160
a general with his troops is that you have to have an objective.

1215
01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.440
You got to know what,
how do I want my dog?
You know,

1216
01:10:08.441 --> 01:10:11.590
what does a finished dog look like?
You got to know in your mind,
what is that?

1217
01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:13.950
Just like if you want to be a black belt in Jujitsu,

1218
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.050
you want to own a $10 million company,
whatever it is.

1219
01:10:17.051 --> 01:10:19.810
If you don't know where you want to go,
you're not going to steer it anywhere.

1220
01:10:19.811 --> 01:10:22.600
You're gonna be floating around.
Uh,
so you've got to know that first.

1221
01:10:22.601 --> 01:10:25.870
Then you gotta be honest with yourself in terms of doing an evaluation,

1222
01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:28.360
where am I k now I know where I want to be.

1223
01:10:28.361 --> 01:10:31.870
I know we're on that and now it's formulating a plan and then you schedule it

1224
01:10:31.871 --> 01:10:34.480
and execute it.
Just like every other aspect of your life.

1225
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.890
There was honestly no difference.

1226
01:10:35.891 --> 01:10:38.500
The neat thing about dog training is that you know,

1227
01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:42.550
you can go through that process dozens of times,
you know,

1228
01:10:42.551 --> 01:10:45.800
as a dog trainer especially,
but even if you just have a dog that,

1229
01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:49.900
that it's a condensed process that's,
that's in a such a controlled environment.

1230
01:10:49.901 --> 01:10:51.430
You see the cause and effect.

1231
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.760
You see that the criteria driven algorithmic process that exists in all of life,

1232
01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.790
but it plays out and you're,
you're manipulating it,
you're controlling it.
You're,

1233
01:11:00.791 --> 01:11:04.960
you're directly influencing every aspect of it.
And so,
uh,
I've,

1234
01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:09.760
I've learned more about people by training dogs and I would have ever imagined.

1235
01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:12.700
And you know,
I mean it's,
it's mind numbing almost.

1236
01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:16.230
How much can you can learn from training dogs and how to interact with people

1237
01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:19.800
based on,
on all of that.
You know,
it,
uh,
it's,
it's pretty,

1238
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:21.060
pretty fascinating I think.

1239
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.060
<v 3>Yeah.
No,
there's no doubt.
I got that all out of this book to uh,</v>

1240
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:27.440
going on to what you talked about a little bit,

1241
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:31.940
but just to clarify what you specifically wrote in the book here,

1242
01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.960
you talk about meeting a dog.
Before we get into the specifics of that process,

1243
01:11:35.961 --> 01:11:40.640
I want to take a moment to turn this discussion around again and focus on you

1244
01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.600
and not the dog.

1245
01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.230
If a dog is looking for someone to take charge and exert authority over him,

1246
01:11:45.231 --> 01:11:47.720
in order to not burden him with that responsibility,

1247
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:49.880
then you need to carry yourself a certain way.

1248
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.750
I go back to something I said in the introduction about wanting to be respected

1249
01:11:53.751 --> 01:11:55.130
over being liked.

1250
01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.720
Think about the kinds of introductions and greetings you've had with people and

1251
01:11:59.721 --> 01:12:01.640
a variety of ways in which they've interacted with you.

1252
01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:04.820
How would you respond if you met someone for the first time and they rushed up

1253
01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.500
to you,
hugged you top tussled,

1254
01:12:06.501 --> 01:12:10.520
your hair jumped up and down in generally acted like you were the greatest

1255
01:12:10.521 --> 01:12:11.780
person on the face of the earth.

1256
01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:15.710
Wouldn't you think that or would you think that person's assessment of you was

1257
01:12:15.711 --> 01:12:18.620
valid?
Would you like that kind of physical contact?

1258
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.880
Would you think that this was a great starting point for a longterm
relationship?

1259
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:24.680
Would you have respect for that person?

1260
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:26.270
And then you get to this point where you say,

1261
01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:31.420
what kind of dog is going to be attracted to that kind of greeting and that

1262
01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:35.570
message and the answer is a needy dog,
eh,

1263
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:39.830
that's an incredible point.
You know,
you really want,
you know,

1264
01:12:39.831 --> 01:12:43.160
let's say you're hiring an employee and the employee you can tell just needs a

1265
01:12:43.161 --> 01:12:45.140
lot of encouragement even though they're all fired up,

1266
01:12:45.141 --> 01:12:48.620
but the more you fire them up,
the more fired up they get.
Well does that,

1267
01:12:48.621 --> 01:12:51.770
the person you really want to have that's going to take you there to emotionally

1268
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:55.370
prod them along to get them where you want to go?
The answer is obviously no.

1269
01:12:55.730 --> 01:12:56.630
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
one of the,</v>

1270
01:12:56.631 --> 01:12:59.960
one of the most common kind of scenario analogies that I,

1271
01:12:59.961 --> 01:13:04.850
I throw at people when know I do a lot of speaking and the events and

1272
01:13:04.851 --> 01:13:07.520
conferences and whatever,
and um,
you know,

1273
01:13:07.521 --> 01:13:10.640
one of the almost always offline people are like,
oh my dog,

1274
01:13:10.641 --> 01:13:13.730
or I need to send them to him.
Like,
that's not going to fix it.
You know,

1275
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:15.230
no different than if you send me your kids,

1276
01:13:15.231 --> 01:13:16.340
like they're going to work well for me.

1277
01:13:16.341 --> 01:13:19.550
They're not going to work well for you because you're not doing it.
Uh,
but,

1278
01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.030
but think of it from a perspective,
from a board room is that,
you know,

1279
01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:25.460
when they say,
oh,
my dog doesn't respect me,
there's two things.

1280
01:13:25.461 --> 01:13:29.570
There's a big difference between respecting and,
and a and enjoying or liking.

1281
01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:35.010
So the first,
first example I use is the,
you know,
being at a bar.
Um,
and I'll,

1282
01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:39.170
I'll,
I'll save the,
the,
the heavy details,
but the gist of it is that if,

1283
01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:43.070
if the opposite sex is throwing themselves at you.
Do you like that?
Well,
yeah.

1284
01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.720
Do you enjoy it?
Absolutely.
Do you respect that person?
No.
You know,

1285
01:13:47.721 --> 01:13:51.160
so you can spoil your dog.
You can let them sleep.
And I let them sleep in my bed.

1286
01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:53.900
I take him for walks,
I'd give him treats,
I take them to acupuncture and he just,

1287
01:13:53.901 --> 01:13:57.710
he doesn't listen to me.
Like I bet your kids don't either.
And that's why,

1288
01:13:57.711 --> 01:13:58.640
because it's,
it's the,

1289
01:13:58.641 --> 01:14:02.150
it's the 19 year old at the bar that's trying to flatter yeah.
That,
that doesn't,

1290
01:14:02.151 --> 01:14:04.520
uh,
it's enjoyable,
but it doesn't,
doesn't Garner respect.

1291
01:14:04.521 --> 01:14:08.820
The second thing on a more serious note is,
um,
think of a board room,

1292
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.330
and I use this because I talked with a lot of business folks and,
and things,
uh,

1293
01:14:13.331 --> 01:14:14.620
different events.
And,
uh,

1294
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:17.030
let's say that you are tasked with going in front of the,

1295
01:14:17.031 --> 01:14:21.520
the 12 executives of the company you work for.
Uh,
and,
and you know,

1296
01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.450
your boss says,
Hey,

1297
01:14:22.451 --> 01:14:25.840
you're going to give a PowerPoint presentation and your job depends on this.

1298
01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:27.730
If you knock it out of the park,
you're getting a promotion.

1299
01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:30.520
You're going to be an executive.
If it doesn't go that well,

1300
01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.460
well you're going to pack your stuff and find,
find employment elsewhere.

1301
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.670
Now I want you to think about how you go into that boardroom,
right?

1302
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:38.260
And I want you to think about,

1303
01:14:38.261 --> 01:14:42.550
visualize in your mind interacting with those 12 executives the way that you

1304
01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:46.750
interact with your dog.
How would that,
how would that presentation go?
You know,

1305
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.090
every one of them I'd get laughed out of the room.

1306
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.150
That's why your dog doesn't listen to you because your dog,

1307
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:55.030
you can tell your dog that you're his owner all you want.

1308
01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:57.640
You have to show him that if he doesn't believe you,

1309
01:14:57.641 --> 01:15:01.990
because you haven't shown him that,
guess what?
You're not.
You can think about it.

1310
01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:06.880
You can wish that you were,
you can hope that you were.
Uh,
the fact is,
is that,

1311
01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:11.810
uh,
your dog is going to believe who you show him that you are a,

1312
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:14.350
and if that's a clown,
guess what he thinks you're a clown.

1313
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:19.520
If you're in an emotionally in stable,
you know,
Jay,

1314
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:20.621
uh,
that's how,

1315
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:23.830
that's how he's going to view you if you're a Beta male because you're rolling

1316
01:15:23.831 --> 01:15:26.110
around and letting them,
you know,
uh,

1317
01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:29.580
do whatever he wants to you that he's going to view you as such,
you know,
and,

1318
01:15:29.581 --> 01:15:33.430
and the most dangerous combination because a lot of times you hear the word

1319
01:15:33.431 --> 01:15:36.520
dominance get thrown around alpha and all this other stuff.
I can tell you,

1320
01:15:36.521 --> 01:15:40.180
I can count on one hand the amount of dogs that I've come across that we're

1321
01:15:40.181 --> 01:15:43.360
truly what I would consider an an Alpha dog.

1322
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:45.820
And this is a dog that even with all my experience,

1323
01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:49.240
all of the manipulations I can provide in terms of,

1324
01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:52.960
of setting the environment up to,
to make it so that I'll,
I'll,
you know,

1325
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:56.890
impact him that way.
He still wants to fight me over everything,

1326
01:15:56.891 --> 01:16:00.040
no matter what I do and I can't get in his head,
no matter how hard I try,

1327
01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:02.830
no matter what I do physically,
mentally,
environmental manipulation,

1328
01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:06.480
you name it less than five.
Uh,
what,
what does that have?

1329
01:16:06.481 --> 01:16:08.580
Thousands of thousands of thousands of drugs,

1330
01:16:08.581 --> 01:16:13.510
thousands and five that actually need to be the Alpha male over you with

1331
01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.360
everything.
You know,
how to get in their head,

1332
01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.710
that no matter what you do with them,
they still look at,
at,
at everybody.

1333
01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:25.510
Like you're,
you're below me.
Uh,
a handful of them,
less than a handful of them.

1334
01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:29.400
Uh,
and so when I hear especially pet owners,
so I go,
he's really alpha.

1335
01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.960
He's really protective and no,
he's not a what it is.
You're just weak.

1336
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:36.190
There's a power vacuum.
Yeah.
And,
and so you know,
dogs,
again,

1337
01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.420
they don't rationalize.
I don't have the logic and reasoning we have,
they be,

1338
01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:44.450
they come hardwired with a set of genetically inherited traits that say if there

1339
01:16:44.651 --> 01:16:48.640
is no nothing in charge,
if there is a vacuum,
whether I want to do it or not,

1340
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:50.560
I'm going to because somebody has to.

1341
01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:54.880
And so when you see all of these dogs that are dangerous and and guarding of

1342
01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:57.850
food and and territorial and all this other stuff,

1343
01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:02.620
you have a dog that doesn't want to be in charge but is taking that role because

1344
01:17:02.621 --> 01:17:06.370
nobody else will.
And that is a absolute recipe for disaster.

1345
01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:08.170
And that's why you see so many problems with,

1346
01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:11.980
with dogs and their owners is because of that simple fact in and of itself.

1347
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:16.020
<v 3>Yeah.
You talking,
you know,
again,
we're talking about all these similarities.</v>

1348
01:17:16.021 --> 01:17:16.831
Here's,
here's the thing.

1349
01:17:16.831 --> 01:17:20.760
You got in the book encouraging that kind of over the top display of affection

1350
01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:24.150
is the complete opposite of how you should present yourself to an unfamiliar

1351
01:17:24.151 --> 01:17:24.984
popper dog.

1352
01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:28.020
You are the one who is making the decision that you are the one in charge and

1353
01:17:28.021 --> 01:17:29.790
how you carry yourself into the situation.

1354
01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:33.840
And what signals your body language sends are something that any dog will

1355
01:17:33.841 --> 01:17:35.400
recognize and decode immediately.

1356
01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:39.090
Do you want to concede the position of power in that relationship immediately?

1357
01:17:39.091 --> 01:17:42.510
Absolutely not.
And again,
this is the same thing as a leader.
Now,

1358
01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.450
this doesn't mean,
and you point this out in the book,

1359
01:17:45.451 --> 01:17:46.770
this doesn't mean that you dominate.

1360
01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.380
This doesn't mean that you comment and you're,
you're overly aggressive.

1361
01:17:49.381 --> 01:17:51.270
And I talk about that all the time with being a leader.

1362
01:17:51.271 --> 01:17:54.480
This doesn't mean that you're calm and you're barking orders at people cause

1363
01:17:54.481 --> 01:17:55.950
that doesn't work either.
That,
that,

1364
01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.330
so you got to find that balance just like you do with,
uh,
with humans.

1365
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.210
<v 2>Sure.
Yeah.
There's a couple of things with that.
Again,</v>

1366
01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:06.890
with dogs especially because it's,
it's so simplified,
you know,
that that,

1367
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:11.450
uh,
that element is reduced to a very primal nature.

1368
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.350
You know,
so when you have a dog that truly is dominant,
if you display that,

1369
01:18:15.351 --> 01:18:17.170
guess what?
You're getting in a fight.
Uh,

1370
01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:20.060
if you have a dog that's not that way and you display that,
what happens?

1371
01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:23.380
The dog is scared.
Uh,
when the dog is scared of,
you know,
different than if,

1372
01:18:23.381 --> 01:18:27.380
if you,
you know,
have,
have a child that's with a third grade level,
you know,

1373
01:18:27.381 --> 01:18:29.870
when they walk into a classroom,
uh,

1374
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:32.990
or they're sitting in a classroom and the teacher walks in and they blow their

1375
01:18:32.991 --> 01:18:34.600
anal glands,
you know,
because they're,

1376
01:18:34.601 --> 01:18:37.940
they're getting ready to get whipped with rulers and,
uh,
you know,

1377
01:18:37.941 --> 01:18:39.800
electrocuted or God knows what else.

1378
01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.230
They're not gonna learn anything on the transverse.

1379
01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:45.860
If when you walk in there throwing spit wads and playing tag and ignore you

1380
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:47.840
entirely,
they're not gonna learn anything there either.

1381
01:18:47.841 --> 01:18:51.370
So just like in all walks of life,
there's balance.
But what it is,

1382
01:18:51.371 --> 01:18:55.150
is it's exactly that.
It's,
it's maintaining a level of,

1383
01:18:55.610 --> 01:19:00.280
of emotional stability,
a calm demeanor and,
and arrested,
uh,

1384
01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:04.070
but calculated mind in terms of how you interact with that animal.
And it's,

1385
01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:07.900
it's really,
it's not hard at all there.
There's two videos that I,
uh,

1386
01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.570
in my online thing called be the man,
be the man part one,

1387
01:19:11.571 --> 01:19:15.540
and be the man part two where I do exactly that.
I don't say really a word.
Uh,

1388
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:20.670
in essence to the two different dogs,
both very strong,
very dominant dogs that,

1389
01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:24.620
you know,
their,
their level of prey drive for a toy,
a ball,
a tug,
what have you,

1390
01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.280
is such that if I have it,
they just,
you know,
they,

1391
01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:29.910
they start shaking and barking and balancing and the,

1392
01:19:29.911 --> 01:19:32.610
and they'll try to take it from me even though they're both personal dogs and

1393
01:19:32.611 --> 01:19:36.320
mine in the past,
their drive is so overblown and overdriven that,

1394
01:19:36.321 --> 01:19:38.720
that it overrides everything common sense wise.

1395
01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.290
And you actually can't use that to train them because it's,
it's so,
so overdriven

1396
01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:45.420
<v 3>but so some people are all excited about prey drive,
but you can have too much.</v>

1397
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:50.150
<v 2>I drive if you're not balanced.
Um,
I would say that it's,
to me,
I would say no,</v>

1398
01:19:50.151 --> 01:19:52.490
there's no such thing in my opinion for the dogs I work with,

1399
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:56.300
I would say there's no such thing as too much.
There is too much to do.

1400
01:19:56.301 --> 01:20:00.040
Certain types of training with it.
If I'm trying to teach obedience,
focus,
uh,

1401
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:04.190
stuff like that.
No,
I won't use balls and toys like that because it is too much.

1402
01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:08.550
I'll use food or body language now when it comes to controlling impulse and

1403
01:20:08.551 --> 01:20:09.810
things like that.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1404
01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:13.560
But it's after I've done enough repetitions to where it transfers from being a

1405
01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:16.410
decision to a reaction,
no different,
but you can end up with,

1406
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:18.030
can you end up with a dog that's,

1407
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.660
he's prey drive is so high that he,

1408
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:25.320
you can't take him to the park and trust that he's going to,

1409
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.330
or can you train it out of what he can train you?
Well,

1410
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.330
you can control it and you can cap that drive by reinforcing it.

1411
01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:35.331
So think of it this way and this is the more drive and lack of impulse control

1412
01:20:35.551 --> 01:20:38.580
that dogs have.
Um,
the more,
you know,
energy,
et Cetera,

1413
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.960
all the things that typically wind dogs up in shelters,
all of those,

1414
01:20:42.961 --> 01:20:47.370
those components,
uh,
or something that can,
that can absolutely be controlled.

1415
01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.420
But the thing to remember is that,

1416
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:53.130
think about the first fistfight you were ever in,
or even if it happens now,

1417
01:20:53.131 --> 01:20:56.250
and think about where your mind is at,
it's at a very elevated state.

1418
01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.270
Just like when you see an amateur fight or the first couple of fights,

1419
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:04.080
like you know they're swinging for the fences.
They blow their why,
they you know?

1420
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:06.800
Whereas you see a guy that's calculated that's been doing it awhile,

1421
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:08.460
he knows how to control that.
That's,

1422
01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.610
that's in essence what you're teaching the dog,
but you have to do it.

1423
01:21:11.611 --> 01:21:12.750
They can't rationalize that.

1424
01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.170
The way you do it as the exact same though is that you're putting them through

1425
01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:17.210
so many repetitions.

1426
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:21.240
No different than thinking about the very first time you were on your primary

1427
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:23.520
and you pull the trigger and nothing happened.
You had to think,
okay,

1428
01:21:23.521 --> 01:21:26.850
I'm going to put it down and it's trigger control and you're doing all the

1429
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.640
things in your head.
At a certain point,
that becomes a reaction,
right?

1430
01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.300
When that becomes a reaction,
then you're trained.

1431
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.600
Same thing with the dog is that you've got to do those repetitions using things

1432
01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:39.790
to reinforce it.
If the dog is in that state of mind,
because the,

1433
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:43.320
the key component is you got to do it when they're not in that state of mind to

1434
01:21:43.321 --> 01:21:45.390
be able to control them when they're in that state of mind.

1435
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:48.210
You have to build that foundation first.
Just,
you know,
you can't,

1436
01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.980
you can't teach a fighter how to be composed by doing real,

1437
01:21:52.981 --> 01:21:56.850
real matches that comes in training.
And so the parallel,
again,

1438
01:21:56.851 --> 01:22:01.020
his is his exact,
uh,
is that you've got to,
you've got to use a classroom.

1439
01:22:01.021 --> 01:22:05.190
And what I do,
I use a 40 by 40 classroom where I use a clicker food,
treats,

1440
01:22:05.191 --> 01:22:06.600
affection,
body language,
and I,

1441
01:22:06.601 --> 01:22:10.080
and I teach and shape all these behaviors that I'm trying to teach and tell.

1442
01:22:10.081 --> 01:22:11.010
It becomes a reaction.

1443
01:22:11.011 --> 01:22:14.670
And then I just slowly start to introduce distractions and graduate them k

1444
01:22:14.671 --> 01:22:19.330
through 12 until they're,
until they're doctors,
you know,
uh,
of going out and,

1445
01:22:19.331 --> 01:22:22.410
and some of the videos I have of some of the dogs I've worked with,
you know,

1446
01:22:22.411 --> 01:22:24.360
and one of them is a black German shepherd,

1447
01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:29.220
actually just sold them to a big metroplex,
a swat team.
But,
um,

1448
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:32.070
I could take him through Walmart,
off leash.

1449
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:34.650
I could take him to parks where kids are playing soccer around them.

1450
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:36.480
And this is a dog that even if I have a ball,
he'll,

1451
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:38.880
he'll bite through my hand to get to it.
Uh,

1452
01:22:38.881 --> 01:22:41.100
and I could get to where without using any punishment,

1453
01:22:41.101 --> 01:22:44.850
without using any compulsion,
just by doing,
shaping and reinforcing and,

1454
01:22:44.851 --> 01:22:46.440
and using,
uh,
you know,

1455
01:22:46.441 --> 01:22:50.070
that a plus B equals c over and over until it became a condition response.

1456
01:22:50.071 --> 01:22:53.940
And now the dog a works on autopilot,
but it's like your name.
You know,

1457
01:22:53.941 --> 01:22:56.310
when somebody says Jocko,
you don't have to think about responding.

1458
01:22:56.311 --> 01:23:00.060
You've heard it enough times to read.
We do that,
you know,
um,
same,

1459
01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:03.930
same exact print a principle.
What's up with resource guarding?

1460
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.220
Um,
usually what it stems from is,
uh,
is an,
again,

1461
01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.090
an inadvertent creative created behavior.
Uh,

1462
01:23:13.091 --> 01:23:16.560
kids messing with them,
taking food from them.
A lot of times,
you know,
people,

1463
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:18.730
I want to be able to take food.
I don't mess with the dogs when they eat.

1464
01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.800
Now I need to be able to bump him,
walk by him,
take it from him if I have to.
Um,

1465
01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:24.791
but it's,

1466
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:29.140
it's when a dog has really high drive for something and you compete for that

1467
01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:31.050
over and over and over,
you're building,
uh,

1468
01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:34.450
think of it like a barrier in the dog's mind and you've got to,

1469
01:23:34.451 --> 01:23:38.350
your goal is to kind of hit the refresh button on the computer screen and that

1470
01:23:38.351 --> 01:23:41.140
dog's mine.
And so,
um,
you know,
what I'll do,

1471
01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:45.040
like if a dog has real heavy resource guarding with,
with food as an example,

1472
01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:49.390
is that now I'll feed that dog his entire ration of food from my hand throughout

1473
01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:50.224
the day training.

1474
01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:53.920
So now it's not me setting a bowl of food down and now you're going to guard it

1475
01:23:53.921 --> 01:23:57.760
and get,
get crappy with me.
It's,
you know,
when you do what I want,

1476
01:23:57.970 --> 01:23:59.500
then I'm going to mark it and reward it.

1477
01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:02.980
You're getting it from my hand and it just breaks that context wide open.

1478
01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:07.870
And now,
now it doesn't become a thing.
Um,
in the police dog a realm,

1479
01:24:07.871 --> 01:24:10.090
one of the,
one of the most common examples of,

1480
01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:13.510
of that behavior misfiring is his outing.
Uh,

1481
01:24:13.511 --> 01:24:15.970
when we're doing bite work and that dog isn't that crazy,

1482
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:17.410
elevated state of mind and he's,

1483
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:20.740
and he's overlapping pray and defensive drive and you're transferring back and

1484
01:24:20.741 --> 01:24:23.560
forth.
Um,
is it now you say,
okay,
let go.

1485
01:24:23.561 --> 01:24:25.990
Just like the first time he got in a fight,
like,
you know,

1486
01:24:25.991 --> 01:24:28.270
one of your buddies taps you on the shoulder,
hey,
stop fighting.

1487
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.820
Like you don't hear that.
So to,

1488
01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:33.580
to reach that dog's mind when they're in that elevated state,

1489
01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:36.670
it all boils down to you got to enter their mind first to communicate.

1490
01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:40.390
But is it when they're in that elevated state of mind,
what,

1491
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:43.750
what usually happens is they use an equal or a prong collar.
They grabbed their,

1492
01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.330
uh,
the dog's flat collar,
the role at twist it,

1493
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.170
just like a guillotine choke and lift them off.
Um,

1494
01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:53.620
all that does is create conflict between the handler and dog and,
and it,

1495
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.790
and it builds and creates possession over objects.
Uh,

1496
01:24:57.791 --> 01:25:01.570
so with a ball.
I see it all the time.
People want,
my dog won't give me the ball.

1497
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.780
How do I get it from,
what are you doing and you're watching him.

1498
01:25:03.781 --> 01:25:06.310
He was chasing the guy and he's chasing the dog around with the ball.

1499
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:09.280
How do I get them to let go of the ball,
get another ball,

1500
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:12.820
make your ball sexier than the ball that he has.
The second he drops it,

1501
01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:15.550
you mark it and throw the new ball just like that.

1502
01:25:15.551 --> 01:25:18.610
Now the dog will spit it out for you with no conflict with no,

1503
01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.640
no problems whatsoever,
but it's that way with everything.
It's with food,

1504
01:25:21.641 --> 01:25:23.460
it's with toys,
it's with Unh.

1505
01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:27.550
<v 3>We talk a lot about indifference in here as sort of a,
I don't know,</v>

1506
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:31.620
as a as like a base sort of reaction to a lot of stuff and I noticed that with

1507
01:25:31.621 --> 01:25:35.010
my dog.
If I want my dog to drop a ball,
I,

1508
01:25:35.011 --> 01:25:38.880
if I just ignore them for for for five seconds the ball drops out and then he

1509
01:25:38.881 --> 01:25:41.880
looks at me because he knows it's like,
okay,
can you,
can you pay some attention?

1510
01:25:41.881 --> 01:25:44.190
Because I want you to fill this thing again,
but I'm bend down,
grab the ball,

1511
01:25:44.191 --> 01:25:46.950
throw it again.
He comes back,
he wants to,
he wants to fight for it.

1512
01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:50.940
But if I ignore him,
just,
just look away for three seconds.
Ball gets dropped.

1513
01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:51.940
Bend down ticket.

1514
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.610
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean it's the same.
It's the same bar room psychology.</v>

1515
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:59.010
Why aren't you paying attention to me?
But you know,
to,

1516
01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:01.220
to bring it back to the dog aspect is that,
you know,

1517
01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:06.050
if think about it from more of a,
almost a primal nature of think about kids,

1518
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:07.940
when you watch kids,
what's,
what's a very natural,

1519
01:26:07.941 --> 01:26:10.460
when you bring several kids together,
what do they do naturally?

1520
01:26:10.461 --> 01:26:15.350
They chase each other.
It's a natural function in,
in animals,
uh,
on the planet.

1521
01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.080
Uh,
dogs are no different.
So if they have something,

1522
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:20.300
it's a game as much as anything.
But you can,

1523
01:26:20.301 --> 01:26:23.240
you can turn it into something more serious as the dog gets older and they

1524
01:26:23.241 --> 01:26:26.060
become more possessive and driven because you've built those barriers in their

1525
01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:29.750
mind.
Uh,
but in terms of the indifference piece,
100%,
the,
the,

1526
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:33.080
one of the first things I do a with the Warrior Dog Foundation,

1527
01:26:33.081 --> 01:26:36.530
the nonprofit that I have that,
uh,
we retire,
you know,

1528
01:26:36.531 --> 01:26:40.670
former Spec ops dogs and police dogs and contract working dogs and all sorts of

1529
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:44.120
different dogs.
But,
uh,
the very first thing I do with all those dogs,

1530
01:26:44.121 --> 01:26:45.650
I have a pouch of food.
Uh,

1531
01:26:45.651 --> 01:26:49.490
I have a clicker a and the clicker just for those of you that you know,
to.

1532
01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:52.070
So the understanding I'm talking about it just a little mechanical device,

1533
01:26:52.071 --> 01:26:52.791
it has a button on it,

1534
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:56.690
you push and it goes and it just makes it a very mechanical sound that's unique,

1535
01:26:56.691 --> 01:26:59.600
that pairs,
whatever the behavior is with a reward.

1536
01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.290
It's a bridging of stimulus for.
So,
um,
just thinking about it,

1537
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:05.350
like taking a picture,
you know,
is that you're,

1538
01:27:05.351 --> 01:27:06.840
you're letting the dog know that the,

1539
01:27:06.841 --> 01:27:10.670
the instant of what's taking place right this second is correct and our reward

1540
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:13.040
is attached to that.
Uh,
but anyway,

1541
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:16.130
so I let him out of the gate and I've got a two and a half acre training field

1542
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:17.990
around my Kennel facility.

1543
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:21.530
And so it's just me and the dog walking around with a pouch full of food and a

1544
01:27:21.531 --> 01:27:25.220
clicker.
And I,
I completely ignore them.
Um,
and,

1545
01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.180
and I purposely walk away from them and anytime that dog comes over to me,

1546
01:27:29.181 --> 01:27:31.760
I'm market reward it,
turn around and walk away from them again.

1547
01:27:31.761 --> 01:27:35.390
And I'll do that for five to 10 minutes,
three,
four times a day for a few days.

1548
01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.010
And I mean,

1549
01:27:37.011 --> 01:27:40.910
we've taken in over 80 dogs over the last eight years in seven and a half,

1550
01:27:40.911 --> 01:27:44.900
eight years.
And,
uh,
to this day,
there's not been a dog yet.
We're,
we're,

1551
01:27:44.901 --> 01:27:48.630
that has not worked.
Uh,
and I've done it with a lot of other dogs too,
but,
uh,

1552
01:27:48.690 --> 01:27:52.760
is that even if they hate people,
you know,
they're,
uh,
defensive,
aggressive,

1553
01:27:52.761 --> 01:27:57.290
they're environmentally rattled,
the a pts type issues.
What have you,
uh,
is that,

1554
01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:57.920
that,
that,

1555
01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.850
that element of you getting paid and in me shaping certain behaviors works on,

1556
01:28:02.851 --> 01:28:04.830
on all of them,
but it works the same way with people,
you know.

1557
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:07.100
And that's one of the things in terms of something like the leadership stuff

1558
01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:10.820
that you do is that,
is that operant conditioning and positive reinforcement?

1559
01:28:10.821 --> 01:28:15.770
You know,
the,
the four quadrants.
While yes,
I work primarily in the,
in the um,

1560
01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.380
positive reinforcement realm,
I do use positive punishment.

1561
01:28:18.381 --> 01:28:22.660
I use negative reinforcement,
negative punishment.
But uh,
for,
for the layman,

1562
01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.760
think of it from,
you know,
if your,
uh,

1563
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.500
your spouse's out of town and you spend the weekend,
uh,

1564
01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.790
cleaning the entire house,
right?
Uh,
it's spotless.
You know,

1565
01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:34.820
the kids are all in check.
You know,
the old lady comes home and the,

1566
01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.020
the house is spotless.

1567
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:40.070
The very first thing that she recognizes is that the one thing you didn't do was

1568
01:28:40.071 --> 01:28:42.650
take the trash out.
And that's the first thing.
She's like,

1569
01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.740
you didn't take the trash out.
Like,
oh,
I guess I'll have to do that,
you know?

1570
01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.820
And that like,
that's her response.

1571
01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:51.680
How likely are you to clean the house ever again?
Very not likely.

1572
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:56.060
No,
I agree.
Uh,
whereas,
you know,
on the transverse,
if,
uh,
you know,

1573
01:28:56.061 --> 01:29:00.260
she grabs a hold of yet and whatever,
um,
you know,

1574
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:03.960
or gives you some positive,
reinforced,
gives you some positive enforcement,

1575
01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:08.460
may be in another room.
Uh,
then,
uh,
then you know,
that that speaks for itself,

1576
01:29:08.461 --> 01:29:08.701
you know,

1577
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:12.830
so it's that same element and her call me mister clean around here and I'm,

1578
01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.350
I have to pick your head.
Uh,
yeah,
you'll be cleaning the house every weekend,

1579
01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:20.790
you know,
so it's,
um,
it's just,
it's a,
it's a very simple element of,

1580
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:21.721
uh,
you know,

1581
01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:25.530
one of the analogies you could use to is it's the difference between slave labor

1582
01:29:25.531 --> 01:29:27.210
and a job with great benefits.
You know,

1583
01:29:27.211 --> 01:29:31.630
at the end of the day a task is being performed.
Uh,
but one,
you know,
the,

1584
01:29:31.631 --> 01:29:34.470
the level of drive,
motivation,
satisfaction,
happiness,

1585
01:29:34.471 --> 01:29:38.170
on one end there are 280 degree,
uh,

1586
01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:42.660
bipolar or despair opposites.
So,
um,
you know,
just,

1587
01:29:42.661 --> 01:29:46.860
it's just basic reinforcement.
But if you look at everything a dog does in that,

1588
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.230
in that regard,
uh,
and that,
you know,
every,

1589
01:29:49.231 --> 01:29:52.920
every time that they do something that you want,
it gets marked and reinforced.

1590
01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:56.220
Every time that you,
they do something you don't want to gets extinguished and,

1591
01:29:56.221 --> 01:29:59.340
or corrected.
It's very black and white.
Um,

1592
01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:03.000
another quick example is a toys in the house.
You know,
people are like,

1593
01:30:03.001 --> 01:30:06.330
oh my dog's chewing this up to you and add up.
Do you keep toys in the house?

1594
01:30:06.331 --> 01:30:08.810
We always got kongs and other balls and stuff.
My,

1595
01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:12.810
my rule of thumb and my advice to everybody is a make it black and white and the

1596
01:30:12.811 --> 01:30:15.330
dogs might,
again,
he doesn't know the difference between a tennis shoe,

1597
01:30:15.331 --> 01:30:17.550
a stuffed animal,
a Kong toy,
whatever.
It's all crap.

1598
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:21.990
It's laying around your floor.
Uh,
you know,
can you make them distinguish things?

1599
01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:23.900
Yeah,
but let's not put the cart before the horse.

1600
01:30:23.901 --> 01:30:26.580
I teach them to respect what you say first.

1601
01:30:26.581 --> 01:30:29.130
And so he doesn't get to play with anything in the house.

1602
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:32.760
If he knows that nothing gets in his mouth inside the house,

1603
01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:36.300
other than what I hand him,
then,
then it's real easy to teach him,

1604
01:30:36.301 --> 01:30:40.230
don't chew on stuff.
Uh,
it's outside,
it's in a crate,
it's in a Kennel.

1605
01:30:40.231 --> 01:30:42.600
That's when I'll give you things to play with the chew,
with the tug,

1606
01:30:42.601 --> 01:30:43.260
with whatever,

1607
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:46.740
and build that engagement work on the bond and relationship or whatever.
But

1608
01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:51.410
<v 3>do you have in here,
when I see so called problem dogs,</v>

1609
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:54.440
the problem stems from an imbalance of power and relationship and not from the

1610
01:30:54.441 --> 01:30:57.970
dog.
So that's,
that's like the route that you see all the time.
The person's weak.

1611
01:30:58.010 --> 01:31:00.920
We have pretty much already talked about that.
And it's the same thing.

1612
01:31:00.921 --> 01:31:05.420
You see a lot with leadership where you've got someone that's that there's an

1613
01:31:05.421 --> 01:31:09.980
imbalance of power and where it gets more complicated with humans as humans then

1614
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:13.760
do their own kind of self.
Correct.

1615
01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.580
And a lot of times they overcorrect they under correct.
You know,

1616
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.650
if they're being too,
if they're being too micromanaging,

1617
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:23.090
then they go all the way to the other side of total loss.
A fair.

1618
01:31:23.091 --> 01:31:25.950
And now people don't know what to do or if they're being too loud a fair they

1619
01:31:25.951 --> 01:31:30.320
and they go straight to level 12 a micromanagement.
And again,
it's just,

1620
01:31:30.321 --> 01:31:31.280
it's just,
uh,
uh,

1621
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:35.450
a personality thing or a mistake that they're making and imbalances the,

1622
01:31:35.451 --> 01:31:37.790
the relationship that we have with people.
Cause it's like,
well yeah,

1623
01:31:37.791 --> 01:31:41.060
I want you to tell me something to do.
I want you to give me some guidance.

1624
01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:45.260
I just don't want nothing.
Yeah.
And people lose that.
Um,

1625
01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.530
here's another one that's important to establish your authority over a dog.

1626
01:31:48.531 --> 01:31:50.840
Dogs want,
need and seek that kind of presence in their lives.

1627
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:53.240
You just hammer this over and over again.

1628
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:56.090
It's easy in some respects to get a dog to fear you,

1629
01:31:56.091 --> 01:32:01.091
but it can be equally easy to get a dog to respect you just as true with human

1630
01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:01.931
relationships.

1631
01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:05.320
A dog will have more respect for you if you make it clear that good behavior

1632
01:32:05.321 --> 01:32:09.940
gets rewarded and poor behavior has consequences.
You may have noticed,

1633
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:13.300
I have not used the word like or love up until this point in describing the

1634
01:32:13.301 --> 01:32:16.840
human canine relationship.
That is not an accidental omission.

1635
01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:20.230
I've purposely not used those words because too far,

1636
01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.340
often I encounter people who's immediate response to a dog's to try and get the

1637
01:32:24.341 --> 01:32:26.770
animal to like them.
In doing so,

1638
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:30.400
they make fools of themselves than dog eyes possibly put themselves in danger

1639
01:32:30.401 --> 01:32:34.810
because they assume that they know that how they treat their dog is okay with a

1640
01:32:34.811 --> 01:32:35.501
different dog.

1641
01:32:35.501 --> 01:32:39.640
And mistakenly believe that because of all the nice things they do for their
pet,

1642
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.210
their dog should obey their wishes and desires unconditionally.

1643
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:47.050
If you take one concept away from this,
from this beginning part of the book,

1644
01:32:47.051 --> 01:32:51.520
it's this don't mistake liking for respect and don't mistake obedience for
trust.

1645
01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.650
We could be talking about human beings.

1646
01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:58.490
<v 2>It's right there,
clearly,
especially kids.
Oh,
absolutely.
And employees.</v>

1647
01:32:58.491 --> 01:33:02.370
Yeah.
Because it's,
it's not a popularity contest.
Yeah.
Uh,
and,

1648
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.990
and that's where so many parents and,
uh,

1649
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:09.950
administrators or coaches or supervisors,
et Cetera,
go,

1650
01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:14.930
go wildly wrong is,
is worrying what somebody thinks about them.
You know.
Um,

1651
01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.520
and again,
I mean it's the,
to draw back to the microcosm of,

1652
01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:21.680
of the dog training process is that,
you know,
what,
what's the end goal?

1653
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:26.390
Getting your kids or your employees or whatever it is to think you're cool isn't

1654
01:33:26.391 --> 01:33:31.370
part of the process.
You know,
it has no relevance.
Well I mean it,
it has no,

1655
01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.730
no productive productivity.
Yeah.

1656
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:38.830
And what's interesting about [inaudible] used to run the job course,

1657
01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:40.700
uh,
the junior officer training course,

1658
01:33:40.701 --> 01:33:45.460
which is the guys that the young officer's coming out of buds and there was an

1659
01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.110
officer,
this is the other end of the spectrum.
There was an officer

1660
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:51.980
<v 3>that would come in to talk and eventually Lafe had to like back the guy</v>

1661
01:33:51.981 --> 01:33:53.240
tactically out of the schedule.

1662
01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:57.830
Cause he would say if you're an officer and your men like you,

1663
01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:02.510
you're doing a bad job.
That's not what we're talking about here.
You know,

1664
01:34:02.630 --> 01:34:03.650
it's not that you don't,

1665
01:34:03.651 --> 01:34:06.830
it's not like you want your dog to aggressively hates you and you don't want

1666
01:34:06.831 --> 01:34:09.680
your employees to think this guy doesn't care about me.
In fact,

1667
01:34:09.681 --> 01:34:13.190
I talked about this a,
uh,
a little while ago.
Like the more you,

1668
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:15.680
the more you care about your people,
the more they'll care about you,

1669
01:34:15.681 --> 01:34:18.140
the better performance they they deliver.
Right.

1670
01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.720
If they don't think you care about them,

1671
01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.360
<v 2>then they're not going to deliver any kind of a performance other than the</v>

1672
01:34:23.361 --> 01:34:27.350
absolute minimum that's required.
Yeah.
And you know,
from,

1673
01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:29.990
from the dog's perspective,
that's where,
you know,
the,

1674
01:34:29.991 --> 01:34:33.440
there is a little bit of a difference in that with dogs,
it's about engagement.

1675
01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.400
Uh,
you know,
one of the,
one of the examples I use is,
you know,

1676
01:34:37.401 --> 01:34:40.010
how many times have you been to a park?
Right.

1677
01:34:40.011 --> 01:34:42.800
And you see theirs and it's usually dad's,
but uh,
you know,

1678
01:34:42.801 --> 01:34:45.650
there's the dad sitting on the bench on his phone and his kids are swimming and

1679
01:34:45.651 --> 01:34:47.300
playing tag or whatever and he's oblivious.

1680
01:34:47.301 --> 01:34:50.480
Like they could get kidnapped and they wouldn't know any better unfortunately.

1681
01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:53.240
Whereas that dad that's pushing them,
that's playing tag,

1682
01:34:53.241 --> 01:34:55.880
chasing them around grab ass and with them,
all that kind of stuff.

1683
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:59.660
Now when he back,
hey honey,
what'd you do?
Well,
I took the kids to the park,

1684
01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:02.690
but those were two disparately different experiences.

1685
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:06.260
Now think about from the perception of where the kids are at,
the difference.

1686
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:08.900
Like it's night and day.
Same thing with a dog.
You know,

1687
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:12.770
and that's one of the things I'm,
I'm uh,
so adamantly against dog parks,

1688
01:35:12.771 --> 01:35:17.630
dog parks are the iPads to two dogs.
What iPads are to kids.

1689
01:35:17.690 --> 01:35:21.470
Uh,
you know,
you can't have a substitute for that engagement with them.
You know,

1690
01:35:21.471 --> 01:35:26.070
you can't outsource your relationship.
Uh,
and that,
and that happens way,

1691
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.930
way too often,
you know,
again,
whether it's with kids and,
and uh,
you know,

1692
01:35:29.931 --> 01:35:31.460
with dogs,
whatever.
Like,
you know,

1693
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:36.590
there is an element of just like with anything is that,
you know,
there's uh,

1694
01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:36.861
you know,

1695
01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:40.760
training franchises that I'm actually planning on launching here later this year

1696
01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.150
to help with that process.
But it is,
it's an augment,
you know,

1697
01:35:44.151 --> 01:35:48.440
and there is no substitute for,
for what you have with,
with your dog,

1698
01:35:48.441 --> 01:35:50.060
with your spouse,
with your children.
Whenever there's,

1699
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:51.370
there's nobody that's going to be able to,

1700
01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:53.350
to make that work for you if you don't want it.

1701
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.900
Just like somebody comes and make me a good,
good Jujitsu artists.

1702
01:35:56.901 --> 01:35:58.430
Like when you got to want it first,

1703
01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:02.420
like you gotta be willing to put the time in with dogs is it's no different.

1704
01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:06.780
<v 3>To that point.
Here's back to the book.</v>

1705
01:36:06.810 --> 01:36:11.810
The bottom line is that if your dog isn't doing what he is supposed to or what

1706
01:36:11.821 --> 01:36:14.370
you want them to,
it's not the dog's fault,

1707
01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:17.010
it's your fault accountability.

1708
01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.950
It's your fault for not spending the time needed to train them properly.

1709
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.970
We're not being observant,

1710
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:25.440
urban and enough to recognize early on when and how your relationship may be out

1711
01:36:25.441 --> 01:36:28.920
of balance.
Many people are too lazy to achieve the results they want.

1712
01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.550
If having a spectacular relationship with your dog were super easy,

1713
01:36:32.551 --> 01:36:36.270
everyone would have a have that and I wouldn't be writing this book right now.

1714
01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.440
One common excuse I hear all the time is I don't have time.
Well,

1715
01:36:40.441 --> 01:36:42.660
I can assure you,
you do have the time.

1716
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:47.580
What you don't have is your priorities in the order they need to be to have a

1717
01:36:47.581 --> 01:36:49.020
great relationship with your dog.

1718
01:36:49.230 --> 01:36:51.820
This is a little bit of extreme ownership for your dog and it's not.

1719
01:36:51.821 --> 01:36:54.690
We say all the time,
your team's not doing a good job.
Who's fault is it?

1720
01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:57.590
It's your fault.
You're the boss.
That's whose fault it is.
Yeah,
yeah,

1721
01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:00.810
<v 2>yeah.
I mean,
and,
and what I would hope,
uh,</v>

1722
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:04.220
is that the people that read that read that,

1723
01:37:04.221 --> 01:37:08.960
that you know that you can take that,
that self evaluation seriously.
You know?

1724
01:37:08.961 --> 01:37:12.200
And,
and again,
I mean,
when I,
when I read extreme ownership,
it was like,
yeah,

1725
01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:15.710
I said it's textbook.
You know,
it's,
it's the same,
same exact principles and that,

1726
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:20.000
you know,
if,
if you're the one in charge,
guess what,
you know,

1727
01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.550
if it's not going well,
it doesn't work down.

1728
01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:27.140
It's not trickle trickle down responsibility.
It goes straight to the top.

1729
01:37:27.141 --> 01:37:29.130
And that's something I'm,
I'm out of,

1730
01:37:29.131 --> 01:37:32.180
been adamant about with my employees is that,
uh,
you know,
if,

1731
01:37:32.181 --> 01:37:35.550
if you don't underst if you screw up within reason,
it's,

1732
01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.500
it's generally going to be my fault.
Right,
right.
You know,
um,

1733
01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.480
if you don't understand what you're supposed to do or,
or,
you know,

1734
01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:44.720
something happened that,
uh,
that you weren't prepared for or whatever,

1735
01:37:44.721 --> 01:37:46.220
then ultimately it's my bad,
you know,

1736
01:37:46.221 --> 01:37:48.760
whether it's me putting the wrong person in a position to,

1737
01:37:48.761 --> 01:37:53.030
to experience that or me not giving you the guidance prior to putting you in

1738
01:37:53.031 --> 01:37:56.130
that experience to be able to deal with it.
Because with dogs,
it's dynamic.

1739
01:37:56.131 --> 01:37:58.400
You know,
just like in the workplace,
you know,
training people to,

1740
01:37:58.401 --> 01:38:02.640
to work with some of these dogs that we get in.
Like,
I mean,
it's,
it's no circus.

1741
01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:06.150
It is a circus,
but it's no joke.
Uh,
it can be a circus,
you know,

1742
01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:07.790
but it's the same,
same type stuff.
Yeah.

1743
01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:11.600
<v 3>You talk about building the relationships here,
going back to the book,</v>

1744
01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.660
working in my training of working dogs,

1745
01:38:14.661 --> 01:38:18.410
I still put myself in the dog's position and understand that it was important to

1746
01:38:18.411 --> 01:38:23.411
establish a positive rapport with that animal before I began making too many

1747
01:38:23.901 --> 01:38:24.734
demands on him.

1748
01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:30.040
<v 2>So this is the crux really of of where I wouldn't say nothing that that's in</v>

1749
01:38:30.141 --> 01:38:34.940
this book or anything that I subscribed to a is not anything new.

1750
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:36.980
You know,
that,
I mean,
people have been,

1751
01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.780
have domesticated animals for thousands of years.
What I will say is that,
um,

1752
01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:45.250
I generally don't find people,
uh,

1753
01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:49.990
spending as much time on that,
that simple component,
um,

1754
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:51.050
as much as I do.

1755
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:55.460
And this is where I draw from my time with hard driven,

1756
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:59.650
dominant working dogs that are biting people.
And when you get an a bite suit,
uh,

1757
01:38:59.651 --> 01:39:02.930
and you're working a dog,
uh,
and,
and developing him,

1758
01:39:02.931 --> 01:39:06.350
no different than you'd bring up a young fighters that,
that,
that is what,

1759
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:10.840
what a decoys job is to do,
is to,
is to build confidence and,

1760
01:39:10.841 --> 01:39:15.470
and with dogs,
you know,
the nice thing is,
is that when it comes to,
to aggression,

1761
01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.530
pray in defense are two sides of the same coin.
You know,

1762
01:39:18.531 --> 01:39:23.531
just like a reproductive or reproduction and killing our two sides of the same

1763
01:39:24.441 --> 01:39:29.440
coin.
Um,
is that when I'm,
when I'm in that suit and I'm reading that dog,

1764
01:39:29.441 --> 01:39:31.550
I'm,
I'm exuding all of these things on him.

1765
01:39:31.551 --> 01:39:35.210
I'm either making him uncomfortable and putting them in defensive drive and then

1766
01:39:35.211 --> 01:39:37.670
when he responds,
the way that I want gives me,
you know,

1767
01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:41.330
aggression of responds in kind with aggression.
I,
I go back into prey drive,

1768
01:39:41.331 --> 01:39:43.790
take all that pressure off and reward him coming forward.

1769
01:39:43.791 --> 01:39:48.260
I'm teaching him to fight me and come forwardly aggressive.
Um,

1770
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:50.360
but the,
the way that,

1771
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:55.390
that I have been able to develop that same strategy with pet dogs is because

1772
01:39:56.510 --> 01:40:00.020
when you're in a suit and dealing with these dogs that are on a level 12 out of

1773
01:40:00.021 --> 01:40:03.890
10,
by comparison to the pet dogs we deal with is that,
you know,

1774
01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.600
you have to be so,
uh,
over overblown or,
um,

1775
01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:10.100
so dramatic with,

1776
01:40:10.101 --> 01:40:13.010
with how you're doing it to be able to affect these dogs that now when you're

1777
01:40:13.011 --> 01:40:16.550
dealing with pet dogs,
it's,
it's actually really easy.
Uh,
but what,

1778
01:40:16.551 --> 01:40:21.551
what it made me realize is just that same concept works the exact same way with

1779
01:40:22.671 --> 01:40:23.630
those dogs.
Is that,

1780
01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:29.300
is that entering that dog's mind and getting that relationship first before you

1781
01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:34.310
have that you are completely wasting your time doing anything else.
Uh,
again,

1782
01:40:34.311 --> 01:40:38.590
no different than,
you know,
if,
if you're a boss with employees or,
uh,
you know,
a,

1783
01:40:38.610 --> 01:40:42.940
a military,
a leader or pick anything is that if,

1784
01:40:42.941 --> 01:40:46.830
if there isn't trust and relationship there first as the foundation,
you're,

1785
01:40:46.831 --> 01:40:51.040
you're building a shanty on,
on sand,
you know,
in terms of,

1786
01:40:51.041 --> 01:40:54.790
of everything else,
you try to do that without,
uh,
you're,

1787
01:40:54.791 --> 01:40:57.040
you're essentially wasting your time.
And so I,

1788
01:40:57.041 --> 01:41:01.500
I hammer so hard on the relationship component because it is,
it's,
I mean that,

1789
01:41:01.501 --> 01:41:03.960
that's a universal truth in life.
Yeah.

1790
01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:07.780
<v 0>And it escalates to,
the more you build that relationship,</v>

1791
01:41:07.781 --> 01:41:10.120
the more you can demand.
And of course,

1792
01:41:10.121 --> 01:41:11.610
the inner relationship you're not demanding for people with,

1793
01:41:11.611 --> 01:41:12.850
the more you build a relationship,
you're more,

1794
01:41:12.851 --> 01:41:16.510
you can ask for someone to give to you and the more they'll do for you because

1795
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.070
you have a good relationship with them.
For sure.

1796
01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:21.230
<v 2>And,
and there's,
there's also a reason,
especially on my online training,</v>

1797
01:41:21.231 --> 01:41:25.340
the first five months,
there's no corrections whatsoever.
There's no punishment.

1798
01:41:25.341 --> 01:41:26.870
There's,
there's nothing.
It's all bonding,

1799
01:41:26.871 --> 01:41:30.590
relationship building and reinforcement and shaping behavior that's not by

1800
01:41:30.591 --> 01:41:33.320
accident.
The reason why is it a lot of times people,

1801
01:41:33.321 --> 01:41:34.640
they don't have a relationship with the dog.

1802
01:41:34.641 --> 01:41:36.950
The dog's getting into x or doing y or whatever.

1803
01:41:36.951 --> 01:41:39.500
Let's put a prong collar and remote collar on and let's punish him.

1804
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:40.850
A lot of people do that.

1805
01:41:40.851 --> 01:41:44.690
There's training franchises that the backbone is using remote collars,

1806
01:41:44.691 --> 01:41:48.890
which I vehemently disagree with.
And it's not about a cruelty thing.

1807
01:41:48.891 --> 01:41:51.500
It's about an understanding is that if I see,

1808
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:54.470
if I have a great relationship with that dog,
and again,
you know,

1809
01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.980
the work environment,
whatever spouse,
uh,

1810
01:41:56.990 --> 01:42:01.990
and then we've gone the full run of shaping and reinforcing desired behaviors.

1811
01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:06.440
And I have clearly communicated to him and positively taught him what the

1812
01:42:06.441 --> 01:42:10.940
expectations are now when he's not performing up to that standard.
Now,

1813
01:42:10.941 --> 01:42:15.020
if I correct him and punish him,
guess how much more effective it is.
You know,

1814
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:16.640
because at first it's,
you're just,

1815
01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:21.440
you're just some other jerk that's putting your knee and my rib cage or

1816
01:42:21.441 --> 01:42:22.820
electrocuting me or you know,

1817
01:42:22.821 --> 01:42:25.790
jerking me off my feet with a prong collar just like all the rest of them.

1818
01:42:25.791 --> 01:42:29.950
Whereas now it's like your dad saying,
I'm disappointed in you here.
You know,

1819
01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:34.970
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's a lot more impactful that way.
You know,
so it means more

1820
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:42.160
<v 0>dogs is back to the book dog's respect,
confidence,
power and authority.</v>

1821
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:44.530
And by dogs,
I mean all dogs,

1822
01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:49.000
I don't care how much of an Alpha role any dog is assumed when someone comes

1823
01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:52.060
along who exhibits those three traits to a greater degree than day,

1824
01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:55.120
they will step aside with the exception of the four,

1825
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.850
the four that you come across.
But those,
those are,

1826
01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:03.380
<v 2>I can assure you that nobody on the and the 83 million dog owners or pet spread</v>

1827
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:06.620
spectrum have ever run into,
you know,
these are Unicorns for sure.

1828
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:11.630
What'd you do with those dogs?
Um,
bread,
bread,
some of them.
Um,

1829
01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:15.110
one of them was out on the west coast actually,
uh,
as,
as a working dog,

1830
01:43:15.111 --> 01:43:18.980
just retired here,
not,
not too long ago.
Um,
if I had to,

1831
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:24.070
to pick probably the most gifted physically are across the board dog I've ever

1832
01:43:25.311 --> 01:43:28.420
come across.
It was a dog that,
that was out there for several years.
Um,

1833
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:30.450
that came in.
We put them through his firsthand,

1834
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:35.060
their course and then he deployed and did several deployments.
And,
uh,
just,

1835
01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:39.510
I mean,
he's a freak,
you know,
absolute freak.
But,
um,

1836
01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:42.020
the first year was a funny story.
The first time I met him.

1837
01:43:42.490 --> 01:43:45.770
So we were running our hand,
their course at Auburn University,
at their canine,

1838
01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.420
uh,
detection research institute back when it was still in,
in,
uh,
in progress.

1839
01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:53.450
This is in 20.
We brought the dog in and,
uh,

1840
01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.360
we were staying at a local hotel there and it's eight.

1841
01:43:56.361 --> 01:43:57.950
We can of course putting the dog through.

1842
01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:01.490
And my very first introduction to him is he was staying in the room with his

1843
01:44:01.491 --> 01:44:05.990
handler and they'd spent some time together and it had started to bond.
And,
uh,

1844
01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:08.950
it was like a Holiday Inn Express.
They had free pizza.
And,
uh,

1845
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.450
so of course I'm like,
I'm not gonna pass up free pizza.

1846
01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:15.120
So I've got a paper plate with a couple of pieces of the pie on it and a,

1847
01:44:15.121 --> 01:44:18.210
I walk into the room and the dog just kinda cocks his head.
It looks at me,

1848
01:44:18.211 --> 01:44:22.160
he runs over and literally like a dude,
like a team guy jumps up and just,

1849
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.570
just slaps it right out of my hand and he leans down and starts eating it.

1850
01:44:26.571 --> 01:44:29.830
And then I,
I started to lean down.
He just looks up and I,

1851
01:44:29.831 --> 01:44:32.820
I've been around enough dogs where like,
I was like,
you know,
I'm just

1852
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.753
<v 3>enjoy that.</v>

1853
01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.170
<v 2>Yeah,
that one's on me buddy.
And,
uh,</v>

1854
01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.720
<v 3>the first time I saw our dogs working and I forget who brought him out,
we were,</v>

1855
01:44:41.721 --> 01:44:45.280
we were doing some training and you know,
we,
it was set up but the,

1856
01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.230
the task and it was doing a hit and a building and there was a guy that was

1857
01:44:48.231 --> 01:44:52.880
gonna run.
A decor is going to run.
And I was out there and man,

1858
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:58.050
when Nate,
so I see the decoy go and you can see the dog sees it and the dog,
you,

1859
01:44:58.051 --> 01:44:59.480
you can feel it,
man.

1860
01:44:59.690 --> 01:45:04.690
This dog is ready to murder this guy as if this is just the most insane level of

1861
01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:08.990
passion.

1862
01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:12.750
And he's just on the end of that thing and that you could see the handles Latin

1863
01:45:12.751 --> 01:45:14.570
and Latin and blend it.
Bill letting it build that up build.

1864
01:45:14.571 --> 01:45:19.040
He pulls that quick release Bro.
I was like,
oh my God.

1865
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.740
It was insane to watch him fire off.

1866
01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:24.920
And he took off like 10 feet to when he finally got like,

1867
01:45:24.921 --> 01:45:27.530
he's going a million miles an hour across this field.

1868
01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:31.520
He takes off about 10 feet and just nails.
This guy dragged him to the ground.

1869
01:45:31.521 --> 01:45:34.520
I was like,
okay,
this is a good little system to implement here.

1870
01:45:34.690 --> 01:45:39.190
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
I mean from,
uh,
the new thing about,
I think capability wise,
um,</v>

1871
01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:44.290
is that it's,
you know,
it's a,
it's a nonlethal form of,

1872
01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:49.570
of capture,
you know,
uh,
which is obviously very valuable.
Uh,
the deterrent aspect,

1873
01:45:49.571 --> 01:45:53.320
the psychologic intimidation factor.
Yeah.
That's a real beautiful thing too.

1874
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:56.380
You know,
there's,
there's a lot of elements to,
to have having those dogs.
There's,

1875
01:45:56.381 --> 01:46:00.460
there's just,
you know,
it's amazing you see it,
especially in law enforcement.

1876
01:46:01.150 --> 01:46:02.020
Um,
you know,

1877
01:46:02.021 --> 01:46:07.021
but you'll have guys that will literally stand there with six armed officers and

1878
01:46:07.121 --> 01:46:11.230
fight all sex of them.
When,
you know,
drawn on getting tased,
pepper sprayed,

1879
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:15.010
you throw the 65 pound pointy ears,
little,
little mountain while out,

1880
01:46:15.011 --> 01:46:19.360
and the dude lays straight down like,
I'm not messing with,
you know,
and uh,
yeah.

1881
01:46:19.361 --> 01:46:22.900
It's amazing.
I mean,
uh,
but you know,
you think about it from,
from again,

1882
01:46:22.901 --> 01:46:26.980
from the human component of it's not natural to be attacked by an animal,

1883
01:46:27.010 --> 01:46:30.190
you know,
that nor is it something that most people are comfortable with,

1884
01:46:30.191 --> 01:46:33.400
B have ever experienced.
Most people have mixed it up,

1885
01:46:33.401 --> 01:46:35.680
especially if they're getting drawn on by six officers.

1886
01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:40.030
It's probably not their first fistfight.
Uh,
you know,
but so,
yeah,
I mean,
that,

1887
01:46:40.031 --> 01:46:42.760
that element of it is,
is pretty,
uh,
it's pretty awesome.

1888
01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:48.730
<v 3>Back to the book,
the lax permissive attitude that exists in our schools,</v>

1889
01:46:48.731 --> 01:46:52.770
our homes and our society in general has trickled down into how we interact with

1890
01:46:52.771 --> 01:46:53.191
our pets.

1891
01:46:53.191 --> 01:46:57.560
While there are some benefits to our living in a kinder and gentler societies

1892
01:46:57.590 --> 01:47:00.120
are also some huge drawbacks.
This is particularly,

1893
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:02.460
this is particularly true as it pertains to dogs.

1894
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:05.820
Some people believe that it's impossible to have a well trained dog and to never

1895
01:47:05.821 --> 01:47:09.150
have to physically correct that dog.
I wish that were true,
but it's not the case.

1896
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.830
Let me be clear.
I don't employ,

1897
01:47:10.831 --> 01:47:13.980
and I don't advocate the use of any kind of unnecessary force,

1898
01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:16.620
but please understand this important point.

1899
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:21.180
If all you ever do is reward your dog for good behavior you have and you have no

1900
01:47:21.181 --> 01:47:24.150
consequences for bad behavior than your dog will not have a complete

1901
01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:28.230
understanding of what's expected of.
So when you were talking about,

1902
01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:32.880
you know,
the,
the fact that you sometimes do have to use a call,
a pinch collar,

1903
01:47:32.881 --> 01:47:35.790
you have to use a choke collar.
You might have to use a digit.

1904
01:47:35.791 --> 01:47:39.720
Was it remote color?
You might have to do that stuff.
In fact,
you probably will.

1905
01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:42.560
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean there's,
there's always the chance.
I mean,
the,</v>

1906
01:47:42.561 --> 01:47:45.540
the best way I can kind of break it down as is,

1907
01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:49.070
think of it from raising kids were again,
employees,
like if,
if the,

1908
01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:53.960
if the consequence,
uh,
is,
is the absence of reward.

1909
01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:58.430
That's,
you know,
you,
yeah,
she may come across a dog,
but again,

1910
01:47:58.431 --> 01:48:03.100
this is an outlier exception anomaly,
whatever coin phrase you want to use,
those,

1911
01:48:03.170 --> 01:48:07.550
those aren't realistic,
um,
aspirations to have with a dog.
Like,

1912
01:48:07.551 --> 01:48:10.250
just like with kids,
like,
yeah,
hey,
if you don't clean your room,

1913
01:48:10.251 --> 01:48:13.430
you're not going to get those peanut m and m's.
Oh,
okay,
well,
I'll go do it.

1914
01:48:13.431 --> 01:48:14.360
They may be like,
yeah,
you know what?

1915
01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:17.480
I'd rather not have peanut m and m's and just not cleaned my room.

1916
01:48:17.481 --> 01:48:19.160
Now what are you gonna do about it?
You know,

1917
01:48:19.161 --> 01:48:22.280
like you're gonna run into that as a dad.
A shock collar.
Yeah.

1918
01:48:23.050 --> 01:48:27.830
Two of them cattle prod,
uh,
you know,
so the,
you know,

1919
01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:32.120
that it's a bit of an oversimplification in terms of,
you know,
where,

1920
01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:37.040
what it really boils down to is,
is you know,
when,
how,
uh,
how often,

1921
01:48:37.041 --> 01:48:38.290
you know,
things like that.
I mean,
it,

1922
01:48:38.291 --> 01:48:40.670
it really is not so much a matter of if it's,

1923
01:48:40.671 --> 01:48:44.330
when it's just being smart about how you're implementing it.
So that a,

1924
01:48:44.331 --> 01:48:45.470
it's effective.
And we were kind of,

1925
01:48:45.471 --> 01:48:50.471
my rules of thumb for implementing a compulsion or positive punishment is,

1926
01:48:50.631 --> 01:48:53.450
uh,
is it,
it's not when you're emotional about it,

1927
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.680
it's not when the dog does not understand why it's happening.

1928
01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:02.510
And then the last thing is that the instant the behavior has ceased,

1929
01:49:02.690 --> 01:49:07.190
the punishment has to also,
uh,
what you find a lot of times,

1930
01:49:07.191 --> 01:49:09.410
most times,
uh,
and especially early on,

1931
01:49:09.411 --> 01:49:12.620
if that relationship hasn't been built and that foundation isn't there.
Again,

1932
01:49:12.621 --> 01:49:16.580
I can't explain anything to a dog a lot.
A lot of people,
you know,

1933
01:49:16.610 --> 01:49:19.300
we all have our expectations.
I know I want the dog to sit.

1934
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:21.620
I don't want them to grab sandwiches.
I don't,
I'm knock the kids over.

1935
01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:23.150
I don't want him to bark when it's three in the morning,

1936
01:49:23.151 --> 01:49:26.570
unless there's somebody breaking in.
He doesn't know any of that,
you know,

1937
01:49:26.571 --> 01:49:30.320
so we have to teach them.
Uh,
and if you,
again,
just like with the human component,

1938
01:49:30.321 --> 01:49:33.260
if you're trying to teach somebody something and they don't understand what's

1939
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:36.410
expected of them and you're punishing them for not understanding it,

1940
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:39.800
that that sucks.
You know?
And that's unfortunately,

1941
01:49:39.801 --> 01:49:42.320
that's how most dogs go about their lives,
is that,
you know,

1942
01:49:42.321 --> 01:49:43.880
I don't have a relationship with this dog.

1943
01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:47.690
Let me throw a prong collar and blue collar on him and make him do things and,

1944
01:49:47.691 --> 01:49:51.820
and he just shuts down and he's a verse of two.
It Joey put the,
uh,

1945
01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:55.930
e collar on people and you have them do a little task.
Yeah.
It's,
it's a,

1946
01:49:55.931 --> 01:49:59.500
it's a real simple,
you know,
it,
it dovetails onto this,
uh,
you know,

1947
01:49:59.501 --> 01:50:02.460
this kind of principle is that,
you know,
again,
so that,

1948
01:50:02.461 --> 01:50:05.140
so that you can put yourself on a dog shoes is that,
uh,

1949
01:50:05.141 --> 01:50:09.370
and so what I do when I run handler courses,
um,
you know,
let's say it's youtube.

1950
01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.091
I'm going to have,
you know,

1951
01:50:10.091 --> 01:50:14.110
you be the handler echo is the dogs were going to put the collar on his bicep.

1952
01:50:14.111 --> 01:50:18.420
I'm going to take you out in the next room,
Roger there.
So I'm going to,

1953
01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:19.810
I'm going to take you out in the room and said,
okay,

1954
01:50:19.811 --> 01:50:23.260
we're going to come back in here and I want you to get echo to take this echelon

1955
01:50:23.261 --> 01:50:27.430
front thing,
uh,
put this here and put that there.

1956
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:31.450
That's his,
his task.
For those of you that are listening,
it's like a menial task.

1957
01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:35.380
It's put a pencil and a paper clip onto a box and they're going to be sitting on

1958
01:50:35.381 --> 01:50:37.460
the table in the middle of the room,
all separate from each other.

1959
01:50:37.461 --> 01:50:39.430
And there's a bunch of others.
There's a bunch of the crap here.

1960
01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:42.120
So when we come back in now,
you don't say anything to them.

1961
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:46.060
We're not allowed to talk.
And so now echo just starts grabbing stuff.

1962
01:50:46.090 --> 01:50:50.590
And every time he grabs the Sharpie,
you get shocked.
He grabs the,
uh,
the,
the t,

1963
01:50:50.591 --> 01:50:53.500
he gets shocked.
He grabs the knife,
he get shocked.
He messes with the paper,

1964
01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:57.880
get shocked after five or six,
maybe 10,
you know,
he's a strong guy.
I can take,

1965
01:50:57.881 --> 01:51:00.130
take some punishment.
You crank it up and he's not getting it.

1966
01:51:00.131 --> 01:51:02.410
He's messing with the wrong stuff.
I'm going,
if I'm going to hammer him harder,

1967
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:05.470
what's he going to do?
Very quickly,
he's going to do this.

1968
01:51:05.471 --> 01:51:08.230
He's just going to sit here and say,
I'm,
I'm not touching anything anymore.

1969
01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:13.210
Cause he's to be,
becomes aversive to all the stimulus stimuli on,
on the desk,
uh,

1970
01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:14.500
on the transverse.

1971
01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:17.860
And so what that teaches you is that if your dog doesn't understand that,

1972
01:51:17.861 --> 01:51:19.080
that that's what happens.
And,

1973
01:51:19.081 --> 01:51:21.920
and that's the position you're putting your dog in is the very one you're in.

1974
01:51:21.921 --> 01:51:24.340
And,
and,
and it sucks.
So don't do it.
Um,

1975
01:51:24.490 --> 01:51:26.920
is that you've got to explain to him what,
what you want.

1976
01:51:26.921 --> 01:51:28.810
And you do that through shaping and reinforcing.

1977
01:51:28.811 --> 01:51:33.270
And so the transverse is now we go out,
we pick a different drill,
um,

1978
01:51:33.850 --> 01:51:37.840
and we come back in and now you have a clicker.
Um,
with humans you can say,
hey,

1979
01:51:37.841 --> 01:51:40.300
the click means that that it's good with dogs.

1980
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:43.610
Obviously you have to pair something to it,
but you click and a treat.
Yeah.

1981
01:51:43.670 --> 01:51:46.870
You know,
you could click and give them a jelly bean or whatever.
But uh,

1982
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:52.330
so now you come in and,
and the,
the only,
um,
absence of that is when he met.

1983
01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.910
Like if,
if he grabs the sharpie now and that's not part of the drill,

1984
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:58.360
nothing happens very quickly.
The dog will do what's,
what's called,

1985
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:01.240
learns through self discovery and they start to offer behaviors.

1986
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:02.600
You probably see it in,

1987
01:52:02.601 --> 01:52:05.290
in your dog sometimes when they just start doing stuff looking at you.

1988
01:52:05.291 --> 01:52:08.110
If you have something and they start doing arbitrary movements,

1989
01:52:08.111 --> 01:52:11.710
they're trying to figure out what it's going to take for them to do to get what

1990
01:52:11.711 --> 01:52:15.130
they want that you have.
And so now you wait.
And once that,

1991
01:52:15.131 --> 01:52:18.370
once he grabs what what you want,
you mark it.
And so now he's like,
okay,

1992
01:52:18.371 --> 01:52:20.620
well it's something with this and now it's fun.
It's a game.

1993
01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:23.080
And he's trying to figure out,
his mind's working as positive.

1994
01:52:23.081 --> 01:52:27.880
Everybody's having fun.
The first example,
it sucks,
you know,
it,
it's painful,

1995
01:52:27.881 --> 01:52:31.450
it's stressful.
Uh,
there's cortisol,
it's chaotic.
And again,

1996
01:52:31.451 --> 01:52:35.350
that dog's a plus B equals c and you say the percentage of success is the first

1997
01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:38.650
method is zero.
Zero.
I have not ever done that and I've done it.

1998
01:52:38.651 --> 01:52:42.160
God knows how many times I have never done that experiment where somebody

1999
01:52:42.161 --> 01:52:46.400
successfully perform that task.
Not One time,
uh,
on the transverse.

2000
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.810
<v 2>I'd say the only time we're where they haven't been successful is due to
brevity,</v>

2001
01:52:50.811 --> 01:52:52.480
is that it's taking longer.
But they,

2002
01:52:52.481 --> 01:52:56.960
they either get really close or they finish it.
Uh,
and everybody's laughing,

2003
01:52:56.961 --> 01:53:00.290
you know,
cause you know,
the whole rest of the class is watching and,
and uh,
do,

2004
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:05.020
they're usually laughing during the,
the Colorado,
you know,
but,
but it,
it,
it,

2005
01:53:05.170 --> 01:53:09.050
it paints a very clear picture because a lot of times people that have not put

2006
01:53:09.051 --> 01:53:12.170
their self in a dog shoes.
Again,
just like with leadership is you gotta relate.

2007
01:53:12.171 --> 01:53:15.320
You got to understand how it's gonna impact people.

2008
01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:18.440
When you're implementing different protocols or procedures or leadership

2009
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:21.500
principles,
what does that look like on the other side?
You know,

2010
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:23.440
it doesn't matter if it makes sense to me.
It doesn't matter if it,

2011
01:53:23.441 --> 01:53:27.680
if it seems sound to me,
if they view it as like,
well,
this is crap.
It's unfair.

2012
01:53:27.681 --> 01:53:29.930
It's whatever it may be.
But you've got to,

2013
01:53:29.931 --> 01:53:34.040
you've got to figure out how to manipulate it so that they understand a,

2014
01:53:34.041 --> 01:53:36.650
what the expectations are,
be what the consequences are,

2015
01:53:36.651 --> 01:53:37.850
and then see ultimately what,

2016
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.480
what comes from both of those depending on what they choose to do.
And that's,

2017
01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.690
to me,
that's the beauty of operant conditioning with,

2018
01:53:43.691 --> 01:53:45.290
with dog training is that you're,

2019
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:50.750
you're letting the dog dictate the consequence and no different than with any of

2020
01:53:50.751 --> 01:53:54.770
us.
It,
they enjoy it,
you know,
and it stimulates their mind which they need,

2021
01:53:54.771 --> 01:53:58.250
which is another benefit to bonding and relationship with them is because if

2022
01:53:58.251 --> 01:54:00.380
you're the one stimulating their mind,
guess what?

2023
01:54:00.381 --> 01:54:03.320
Now they want to hang out with you more.
They will listen to you more.
Your,

2024
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:08.350
your blue chip bank just gets overloaded because they've had so many positive

2025
01:54:08.451 --> 01:54:11.690
experiences where they've had different things that it's desirable on your end.

2026
01:54:11.691 --> 01:54:13.040
That doesn't mean anything to them,

2027
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:16.070
but they're just trying things out and now they do it and it gets marked and

2028
01:54:16.071 --> 01:54:17.990
rewarding and it's fun.
It's a game and it's just,
it's a,

2029
01:54:17.991 --> 01:54:21.170
it's a self replicating process that a,

2030
01:54:21.171 --> 01:54:24.020
that has a ton of benefits for you,
for you and the dog.

2031
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:26.570
<v 3>I thought this part was interesting.
You're just,</v>

2032
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:31.350
and it's important to know as well to understand dogs a little bit better.
Um,

2033
01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:35.190
a dog's sense of smell is somewhere between 10,000 and a hundred thousand

2034
01:54:35.370 --> 01:54:38.880
thousand times as sensitive as our own.
There's a PBS television show,

2035
01:54:38.881 --> 01:54:43.110
Nova where a guy named James Walker,
and this is a quote from the book,
he said,

2036
01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:47.940
if you make the analogy to vision what you and I can see at a third of a mile,

2037
01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:52.980
a dog could see more than 3000 miles away.
And there's another example,

2038
01:54:53.250 --> 01:54:54.900
Alexandra Horowitz,

2039
01:54:55.260 --> 01:55:00.260
the author of inside a dog did something similar but kept the comparison in the

2040
01:55:00.421 --> 01:55:04.980
olfactory realm.
You can tell when your coffee has tea or sugar in it.

2041
01:55:04.981 --> 01:55:06.210
By taking a sip of it,

2042
01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:11.900
a dog could sense that same teaspoon of sugar diluted in a million gallons of

2043
01:55:13.171 --> 01:55:16.590
water just by using these nos.
That's insane.

2044
01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:20.100
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
and from a,
so there's two reasons why that's important.</v>

2045
01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:23.630
On the working dog side,
it's,
it's pretty,
uh,

2046
01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:28.460
it's pretty clear to see the benefits that,
that,
that has in terms of,
uh,

2047
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.711
you know,

2048
01:55:28.711 --> 01:55:32.880
sniffing explosives that are buried and a detecting people that are hidden in

2049
01:55:32.881 --> 01:55:36.780
false floors and tracking people and things of that nature.
Um,
on the,

2050
01:55:36.781 --> 01:55:41.670
on the pet dog side,
where that comes into play is that,
is that same,
um,

2051
01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:46.680
you know,
from a relationship is that they recognize you by the way you smell.

2052
01:55:46.730 --> 01:55:50.010
Uh,
they recognize your kids by the way they smell in terms of,
of training,

2053
01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.210
interacting with them,
using treats,
rewards,
toys,
things of that nature.
At a,

2054
01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:57.720
you know,
it,
it plays big,
big dividends or,
or pays big dividends too.

2055
01:55:57.721 --> 01:56:01.920
So it's just one more component that,
you know,
the,
the reason that the,

2056
01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:06.660
that the book is called the navy seal way.
And I,

2057
01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:10.010
if there's one thing I could say that I wish I had done a better job with a,

2058
01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:13.830
was kind of relaxing.
Why,
why that is,
is that,
you know,

2059
01:56:13.831 --> 01:56:18.831
when I think about our reputation and our efficacy and success as a community

2060
01:56:19.711 --> 01:56:23.370
since its inception,
uh,
why is that?
You know,
and,
and it's,

2061
01:56:23.371 --> 01:56:25.920
it's everything that's in this book just related to dogs.
It's,
well,

2062
01:56:25.921 --> 01:56:28.230
it comes by selection,
you know,
have,

2063
01:56:28.231 --> 01:56:32.820
have a very stringent selection process.
But then above and beyond that,

2064
01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:37.890
you know,
seals don't have the success and reputation because,
um,

2065
01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:42.180
because they're good shots or in good shape or have great intelligence or have

2066
01:56:42.181 --> 01:56:46.530
some of the best platforms and,
and augments in terms of close air support,
Isr,

2067
01:56:46.531 --> 01:56:50.090
whatever,
it's because they have all of those things,
you know,
it,
it's,

2068
01:56:50.091 --> 01:56:51.170
it's managing the,

2069
01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:55.710
the every single intangible that you can possibly manipulate and control and

2070
01:56:55.711 --> 01:56:58.680
stack that deck in your favor.
So it's not just training,

2071
01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:02.310
it's not just selecting the right dog,
it's not just feeding them good food.

2072
01:57:02.311 --> 01:57:05.730
It's not just keeping them in good physical condition and an ideal body weight.

2073
01:57:06.150 --> 01:57:09.840
It's not any one component of that.
It's all of them.
Uh,

2074
01:57:09.841 --> 01:57:14.070
and so that the navy seal way,
it's,
it's more about us on a,
on a,

2075
01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:19.190
on a big scale in terms of how we've gotten to where we've gotten in by using

2076
01:57:19.711 --> 01:57:21.760
all of those same,
same concepts,
you know,
and,

2077
01:57:21.761 --> 01:57:25.830
and I used all of those same concepts as a trainer in terms of my selection

2078
01:57:25.831 --> 01:57:30.420
processes is godawful.
Um,
you know,
there's times where we would go on,
on,

2079
01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:35.490
on trips to,
to feel fine dogs.
And,
and,
and since then even were,
you know,

2080
01:57:35.491 --> 01:57:40.440
I may look at dozens or even hundreds of them to find one,
you know,
um,
you know,

2081
01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:45.300
some,
I would say probably attrition rates are even even worse than,

2082
01:57:45.301 --> 01:57:48.000
than buds.
You know,
I mean,
you may have a fraction of a percentage.

2083
01:57:48.001 --> 01:57:51.420
We're in the single digit percentage of dogs that I look at that actually end up

2084
01:57:51.421 --> 01:57:56.220
making it.
So,
um,
you know,
but it's,
it's that crux of a,
and again,
same,

2085
01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.310
same with business.
It's like,
it's not just having good accounting,

2086
01:57:59.311 --> 01:58:02.370
it's not just having good leadership.
It's not good just having good recruiting.

2087
01:58:02.371 --> 01:58:05.460
It's not just having good budgeting and funding.
It's,
it's all of those things.

2088
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.310
And when you manipulate the environment and stack the deck in your favor and

2089
01:58:09.311 --> 01:58:13.440
make things very consistent and black and white have a,
an ideal ma,
um,

2090
01:58:13.650 --> 01:58:16.620
have an idea in your mind of what that finished product is and be able to

2091
01:58:16.621 --> 01:58:20.200
visualize that,
know where you're at,
develop a plan and execute it again.

2092
01:58:20.201 --> 01:58:24.660
It just goes back to the,
uh,
the microcosm that dog training is that a,
that,

2093
01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:29.610
that mimics life,
that talk about this thing and the,
in the book you talk about,

2094
01:58:29.611 --> 01:58:33.120
look for the intelligence behind a mistake.
What do you mean by that?

2095
01:58:34.230 --> 01:58:36.780
So I found that pretty cool.
Yeah.
So the,
you know,

2096
01:58:36.781 --> 01:58:41.260
the intelligence behind the mistake is,
is essentially a teaching moment know,

2097
01:58:41.261 --> 01:58:44.560
is that,
understand why it was made.
Ultimately it's,

2098
01:58:44.561 --> 01:58:48.760
it's you as the handlers fault for why mistakes are made,
but,

2099
01:58:48.761 --> 01:58:52.820
but understand why the dog made the mistake,
you know,
and it could be,
you know,

2100
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.951
it's,

2101
01:58:52.951 --> 01:58:56.530
it's generally gonna going to be reduced down to lack of communication on your

2102
01:58:56.531 --> 01:59:01.210
part.
Uh,
a confusion of expectations on the dog's barking with humans.

2103
01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:06.220
Same with humans.
Same with humans.
Yeah.
Um,
and then,
and then the last thing,

2104
01:59:06.221 --> 01:59:10.530
which is probably one of the most imperative things,
uh,
same with humans is,

2105
01:59:10.531 --> 01:59:14.710
is bringing emotion into the,
the equation.
Uh,
dogs are,

2106
01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:17.710
while they have some simple emotions that mimic humans,

2107
01:59:17.711 --> 01:59:19.360
they're nowhere near as complex.

2108
01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:23.290
One of the jokes I started a lot of my speeches out with is going to find out

2109
01:59:23.291 --> 01:59:25.390
who loves you more,
your,
your spouse or your dog lock.

2110
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:29.020
Both of them in the trunk of your car for two hours after two hours can pop the

2111
01:59:29.021 --> 01:59:33.640
trunk.
Who's happier to see it and uh,
you know,
dog and be like,
hey buddy,

2112
01:59:33.850 --> 01:59:37.270
where are you Ben?
You know,
your life's going to slap the hell out of here.
So,
uh,

2113
01:59:37.271 --> 01:59:40.510
but they are that simple,
you know,
and it's,
it's an Achilles heel of sorts.

2114
01:59:40.511 --> 01:59:44.050
We were talking about it before we came on,
came on air as the iPhone,

2115
01:59:44.530 --> 01:59:47.390
you know that that's really,
dog dogs are actually so simple that,

2116
01:59:47.410 --> 01:59:48.370
that we as humans,

2117
01:59:48.371 --> 01:59:51.820
because we're so much more complicated and how we think and emotionally charged

2118
01:59:51.821 --> 01:59:52.840
and what have you,

2119
01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:57.070
that we make them way more complicated and harder to train than they actually

2120
01:59:57.071 --> 02:00:01.270
are.
A,
it's a,
we need to over simplify it.
And to me,

2121
02:00:01.450 --> 02:00:03.550
not to get too far off on a tangent,
but the,
it's,

2122
02:00:03.551 --> 02:00:07.290
it's Kinda like world world policy,
you know,
foreign policy from a,

2123
02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:12.300
from an international standpoint is that sometimes the simplest solutions are

2124
02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:15.040
the best for the most complex problems.
You know,

2125
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:18.730
foreign policy being a bar fight,
you know,
uh,
if,
if,

2126
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.280
if you're going to go walk into that bar,
you're going to get in a fight,

2127
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:24.640
you know,
and you better bring everything to bear to make sure that you're safe,

2128
02:00:24.641 --> 02:00:28.030
but realize that by walking in there,
no matter whose side you take,

2129
02:00:28.031 --> 02:00:30.670
no matter what happens,
you're going to create at least one enemy,

2130
02:00:30.671 --> 02:00:32.230
probably several,
you know,

2131
02:00:32.231 --> 02:00:36.190
so you better make damn sure that going into that bar is worth going into before

2132
02:00:36.191 --> 02:00:39.450
you go into it.
To me,
that's a pretty simple solution as a simple way to look at,

2133
02:00:39.451 --> 02:00:43.720
at the world's problems.
We don't do that,
you know,
uh,
we overcomplicate it.

2134
02:00:43.721 --> 02:00:48.400
But it's that same same mentality with a dog though is,
is that,
uh,
you know,

2135
02:00:48.670 --> 02:00:53.670
most times it's the most simple solution to what you think or perceive as the

2136
02:00:54.041 --> 02:00:57.020
most complex problem.
And it's really not that complicated.
Yeah.

2137
02:00:57.670 --> 02:00:58.580
<v 3>Yeah.
You talk about,
you,</v>

2138
02:00:58.590 --> 02:01:01.440
you go through a whole section that's about reading your dog and,

2139
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:04.540
and what signals to look for.
And it's the same thing with people.

2140
02:01:04.541 --> 02:01:07.090
You don't get to learn how to read people,
but you talk about their eyes,

2141
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:09.190
you talk about their ears,
what their ears are doing,

2142
02:01:09.191 --> 02:01:10.480
your talk about what their tail,
and this is,

2143
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:13.030
these are all things you told me when I was getting my dog is you know,

2144
02:01:13.031 --> 02:01:17.380
things to look for.
And Man,
they were spot on just just looking at their posture.

2145
02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:20.710
Interestingly,
we just had Jordan Peterson on and we talked a lot about posture.

2146
02:01:20.711 --> 02:01:25.180
He's got a new book out called 1212 rules for life.
And the first chapter,

2147
02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:26.320
this is how to live your life.

2148
02:01:26.321 --> 02:01:30.790
The first chapter is stand up straight with your shoulders back.

2149
02:01:31.090 --> 02:01:35.740
And it's like,
yeah.
And you can see that in dogs and you can see that,
you know,

2150
02:01:35.741 --> 02:01:37.150
in the way that you stand around your dog.

2151
02:01:37.151 --> 02:01:40.310
You've already talked about that a bunch of today,
but um,
just to,

2152
02:01:40.311 --> 02:01:45.311
just to make sure that you have good posture as like simple as that might sound.

2153
02:01:46.521 --> 02:01:48.280
And what do you look for in the posture of a doc?

2154
02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:52.960
<v 2>So this is where it,
it depends on what the,
um,
what you're looking for,</v>

2155
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:54.150
what the end goal is.
You know,

2156
02:01:54.151 --> 02:01:58.210
if I'm looking for a pet than I probably don't want a cocky scorpion tail ears

2157
02:01:58.211 --> 02:02:02.590
up,
chest out looking like King Kong and like he owns the place for a good strong

2158
02:02:02.591 --> 02:02:04.870
working god.
Yeah.
I want a dog that's going to make,

2159
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:09.100
make my backend pucker by grabbing Aleisha and open and his gait and clipping it

2160
02:02:09.101 --> 02:02:11.460
to it.
Like this dog is making me a little nervous cause he's walking around and

2161
02:02:11.461 --> 02:02:12.220
looking at me like,

2162
02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:16.780
I don't sweat you as one of the biggest misconceptions is growling.
Um,
you know,

2163
02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.840
people think,
you know,
grilling,
grilling is weakness.
Grilling is,

2164
02:02:20.841 --> 02:02:24.490
is being scared and it's peacock feathers essentially.
It's a,

2165
02:02:24.491 --> 02:02:28.300
it's a dog's way of saying you're making me uncomfortable.
I'm going to do this.

2166
02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:31.810
And in hopes that it makes you,
you know,
it calls your bluff and backs you down.

2167
02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:33.830
Um,
when I see a dog growls,

2168
02:02:33.850 --> 02:02:36.790
I know I can get in his head faster than a dog is standing there looking at me

2169
02:02:36.791 --> 02:02:40.110
with his tail,
just feather and a little bit with his eyes pinpoint and die,

2170
02:02:40.150 --> 02:02:44.770
you know,
non non dilated pupils and,
and looking at me like,
dude,

2171
02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:48.010
bring it and uh,
you know,
that's the dog I worry about.

2172
02:02:48.011 --> 02:02:49.240
Not the dog growl and with his,

2173
02:02:49.241 --> 02:02:52.900
with his hair up and his ears back and his in his lips curled,
you know that dog.

2174
02:02:52.901 --> 02:02:56.140
I know I can run him if,
if need be,
but um,

2175
02:02:56.230 --> 02:02:59.180
it's just a matter of of grabbing a hold of yourself and saying,
let's,

2176
02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:01.210
we're going to do the man dance and I'm coming after you.

2177
02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:05.170
And 99 times out of 100 and a dog doesn't want anything to do with it,

2178
02:03:05.171 --> 02:03:09.370
but you know,
for,
for a pet,
you know,
again,
it depends on,
you know,
my active,

2179
02:03:09.371 --> 02:03:12.250
do I want a dog that's going to play a deterrent role in terms of protection and

2180
02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:15.430
you know,
do I just want an active companion?
Do I want a docile dog that,

2181
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:20.990
you know,
my kids can snuggle with?
You know,
so to me,
again,
just like with the,
uh,

2182
02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:25.420
kind of the,
the,
the macrocosm of,
you know,
what,
what do you want out of the dog?

2183
02:03:25.450 --> 02:03:29.440
You know,
let that drive your decision and work backwards from there.
But,
um,

2184
02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:30.210
but the,
I think

2185
02:03:30.210 --> 02:03:31.230
<v 3>key point is here,</v>

2186
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:36.470
know that there's traits or visual clues that you can look for that indicate

2187
02:03:36.601 --> 02:03:39.570
what kind of a dog,
what kind of personality of the dog has.
Yeah,
absolutely.

2188
02:03:39.590 --> 02:03:43.650
And if you don't know those and you just go to a random place and you pick the

2189
02:03:43.651 --> 02:03:45.720
dog that came up to you fastest and was wiggling,

2190
02:03:45.721 --> 02:03:48.900
or the dog that was all shy and it looks so cute in the corner,

2191
02:03:49.230 --> 02:03:51.530
there's consequences to getting those dogs.
And they are,

2192
02:03:51.531 --> 02:03:53.400
they're all over the place.
And if you don't know what you're getting,

2193
02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:54.710
you're wrong.

2194
02:03:54.710 --> 02:03:55.461
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,</v>

2195
02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:58.490
and you know the conversation that we had before you best selected years,

2196
02:03:58.491 --> 02:04:01.220
you know,
the,
you hear a lot of things people say,
Oh,

2197
02:04:01.221 --> 02:04:04.210
turn the dog up upside down or put them on his back and see if he's calling.

2198
02:04:04.230 --> 02:04:06.440
You know,
and there's people that,
you know,
if he's calling,
that's the one you on.

2199
02:04:06.441 --> 02:04:10.540
If he's active,
that's the one you went to me.
It's all,
it's all crap.
Honestly.
Um,

2200
02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:14.840
what I like to do is,
is just like in,
in any other selection process,

2201
02:04:14.841 --> 02:04:17.630
I want to take the dog out of his comfort zone and see now,
see how he,

2202
02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:20.870
how he reacts is comfort zone is where he's been raised,

2203
02:04:20.871 --> 02:04:25.580
where he's been living with his litter mates,
with his,
his mom.
Uh,
you know,

2204
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:29.570
if you go to a breeder's house and you evaluate a puppy with the,

2205
02:04:29.571 --> 02:04:31.670
the litter running around and the mom's standing there,

2206
02:04:31.671 --> 02:04:34.850
you are not getting an accurate representation of what that dog's genetic

2207
02:04:34.851 --> 02:04:37.170
components are.
Not even close there.

2208
02:04:37.210 --> 02:04:41.180
There are so many things that have been smoked in,
mirrored,
uh,
in,

2209
02:04:41.181 --> 02:04:44.160
in the dog's benefit.
He's going to look much stronger and better and,

2210
02:04:44.161 --> 02:04:47.790
and active and drive your and dominant and whatever then.
Then he truly is,

2211
02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:51.020
if you want to really see that dog at his genetic face value,

2212
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:53.930
take him somewhere where,
you know,
he hasn't been by himself.

2213
02:04:54.090 --> 02:04:56.460
<v 3>You told me Home Depot,
which I think is a great cause.</v>

2214
02:04:56.461 --> 02:04:59.260
There's things going on at home.
Tons of stuff.
There's noises.
Yeah.

2215
02:04:59.261 --> 02:05:01.920
There's a bunch of people running around.
There's other dogs in there.

2216
02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:04.050
There's kids,
there's all kinds of chaos going on.
Yeah.

2217
02:05:04.150 --> 02:05:05.350
<v 2>Home Depot.
Yeah.
I mean you'll,</v>

2218
02:05:05.351 --> 02:05:09.070
you'll find out about a dog's environmental nerve faster than anything there,

2219
02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:13.000
you know,
um,
and so,
but it can be anywhere busy.
It can be a parking lot.

2220
02:05:13.001 --> 02:05:14.770
It could be Walmart,
it could be an airport.

2221
02:05:14.771 --> 02:05:18.770
I mean wherever you can find that home depot is going to get flooded with.
Yes.

2222
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:22.350
<v 3>By the way,
just Fyi.
Test dogs like the little puppies.</v>

2223
02:05:22.351 --> 02:05:27.030
They're not potty trained yet,
so Fyi for everyone here.

2224
02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:30.660
Here's a cool story you put in here.
Back to the book.

2225
02:05:30.690 --> 02:05:34.950
Carlos came to my care several years ago.
He was seven years old at the time,

2226
02:05:34.951 --> 02:05:39.330
but he had had to retire from the teams during an operation in Iraq on a raid

2227
02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:41.040
that resulted in an intense firefight.

2228
02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:46.190
He and his handler approach to building suspected of housing cashed munitions

2229
02:05:47.190 --> 02:05:52.190
just shorter the entryway or remotely detonated id through the pair back several

2230
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:52.561
yards.

2231
02:05:52.561 --> 02:05:57.150
Carlos broke his back and his hind legs and hips and collapsed his sinuses and

2232
02:05:57.151 --> 02:05:59.400
his lungs.
For privacy reasons,

2233
02:05:59.401 --> 02:06:02.490
I can't go to the injuries his handler sustained other than to say that they

2234
02:06:02.491 --> 02:06:03.330
were extensive.

2235
02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:08.660
Medical personnel acted quickly and both the dog and the handler survived.

2236
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:13.290
Carlos nearly prevented that emergency treatment from being initiated.

2237
02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:16.560
Despite the severity of a of his injuries.

2238
02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:20.940
He crawled to his handlers side and took up a defensive perimeter near his

2239
02:06:20.941 --> 02:06:25.710
fallen comrade.
No one trained Carlos to do that.
He did it for one reason.

2240
02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:26.880
Loyalty.

2241
02:06:28.330 --> 02:06:32.220
<v 2>And you know,
that can't be taught,
you know,
just like it can't be in,
in people.</v>

2242
02:06:32.221 --> 02:06:35.610
It can be reinforced.
Uh,
you know,
it can be conditioned,
tweaked a little bit,

2243
02:06:35.611 --> 02:06:39.540
one way or another.
It can be broken for sure.
Uh,
but that,
that is a,

2244
02:06:39.541 --> 02:06:41.220
in my opinion,
a primal,

2245
02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:45.360
a genetically inherited trait that either exists or it doesn't just like with

2246
02:06:45.361 --> 02:06:49.590
heart,
um,
you know,
and that's,
uh,
that's something that's excrutiatingly rare,

2247
02:06:49.591 --> 02:06:52.110
obviously both in humans and dogs.
And that's one of the,

2248
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:56.040
one of the ways I tested dog is,
is that as I want to test her heart and,

2249
02:06:56.360 --> 02:07:00.540
and see if,
uh,
if when push comes to shove,
if they,
if they want to fight me,

2250
02:07:00.541 --> 02:07:05.460
you know,
and,
and Carlos was,
was a warrior of,
of a,
the highest magnitude,

2251
02:07:05.461 --> 02:07:09.810
no doubt about it.
Um,
you know,
he spent several years with us and then ended up,

2252
02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:10.350
uh,

2253
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:13.860
I retired him to a f a dog friend of mine in Florida that had him for a little

2254
02:07:13.861 --> 02:07:17.550
while.
And the last picture I got,
um,
got of him was,
uh,

2255
02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:20.910
watching the Superbowl laying on a leather couch with a Kong in his mouth.

2256
02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:25.650
Got a couple of weeks before he died.
He got,
got the full spectrum,

2257
02:07:25.651 --> 02:07:27.000
the got the full retirement,

2258
02:07:27.330 --> 02:07:31.920
<v 3>good deal.
You know,
a dog's possessed here.
Back to the book.</v>

2259
02:07:31.921 --> 02:07:36.400
Darks possessed about capability to be loyal,
capability to be loyal.

2260
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:38.710
A dog owner.
As a dog owner,

2261
02:07:38.711 --> 02:07:41.050
you should not take that loyalty for granted or exploited.

2262
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:44.710
You should work to give your dog a reason to be the most loyal to you.

2263
02:07:44.711 --> 02:07:49.240
He can possibly be.
I mean,
does that not go 100% with human beings as well?

2264
02:07:49.630 --> 02:07:53.980
It's,
it's,
you know,
let your dog know that he can trust you.
Yeah.
Be a leader.

2265
02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:57.450
Make sure people know that they can trust you.
I mean,
come on,

2266
02:07:57.470 --> 02:08:01.030
here's another interesting little story you got in here.
So you've got a guy,
Bob,

2267
02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:03.760
who whenever he's working on his car,
he loses his temper,
goes crazy,

2268
02:08:03.761 --> 02:08:08.200
throws to us around.
He doesn't know why his dog doesn't like it.
Uh,

2269
02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:10.420
back to the book when Bob lost his cool.

2270
02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:13.750
Even though Bob didn't direct any of his anger at his dog,
Rudy,

2271
02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:15.760
the dog wanted no part of that scenario.

2272
02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:18.520
Maybe where he was more sensitive to those kinds of responses than other dogs

2273
02:08:18.521 --> 02:08:22.180
might've been.
But Rudy basically lost respect for Bob.

2274
02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:27.670
Bob was the guy he expected to be in command and in control,
and he wasn't.

2275
02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:33.410
What made things worse for Bob was that he knew that was the case.
So,
so I,

2276
02:08:33.470 --> 02:08:36.940
the reason I pulled that one out is because,
again,
I talked about all the time,

2277
02:08:36.941 --> 02:08:39.800
Hey,
if you lose your,
if you lose your temper as a leader,
you're,
you're weak.

2278
02:08:39.810 --> 02:08:42.130
You're,
you're going to look weak,
you're gonna appear to be weak.
And,

2279
02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:46.210
and some people can't control their temper and that's just wrong.
But even a dog,

2280
02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:51.220
even a dog will look at a leader that loses his temper and go,
okay,
I can't,

2281
02:08:51.250 --> 02:08:52.720
I can't,
am I following you?

2282
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:57.300
<v 2>Let's me.
I would say not,
not so much even a dog.
I would say a specialist again.</v>

2283
02:08:57.430 --> 02:09:01.970
Well,
there you go.
Because it's,
you know,
I can't,
I can't talk to my dog and say,

2284
02:09:01.971 --> 02:09:05.360
hey,
sorry about that.
I lost my cool,
it's not going to happen again.
You know,

2285
02:09:05.361 --> 02:09:08.360
I'm still your boss,
but,
uh,
you know,
let's let me make it up to you,
you know,

2286
02:09:08.361 --> 02:09:12.290
whatever.
Not that that's how you'd approach it anyway,
but,
but my point is,

2287
02:09:12.291 --> 02:09:16.340
is that,
you know,
you,
you have that,
that a plus B equals c,

2288
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:19.250
uh,
principle in everything.
You know,

2289
02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:23.410
it's whether it's shaping behavior that you desire,
it's,
uh,
eliminating,
uh,

2290
02:09:23.411 --> 02:09:27.280
undesirable problem behaviors that you've inadvertently created.
It's a,
you know,

2291
02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.580
breaking,
breaking trust and,
and ruining relationships.
You know,

2292
02:09:31.581 --> 02:09:35.870
one of the things that I like to tell people,
uh,
and again,
it's with,
with,

2293
02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:39.870
you know,
human relationships also is it trust is like a piece of paper.
Uh,

2294
02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:43.870
and when,
when you break it,
it's crumpling it up into a ball.
You know,
you,

2295
02:09:43.871 --> 02:09:46.670
you can flatten it back out.
You can iron it,
you can get it real close,

2296
02:09:46.671 --> 02:09:51.140
but it will never be the same.
You know,
if,
if you truly break it,
you know,

2297
02:09:51.141 --> 02:09:55.520
the way that a lot of people do,
um,
be careful with that,
you know,

2298
02:09:55.530 --> 02:09:59.950
cause you only get one crack at ruining it and then,
uh,
and then you're,

2299
02:09:59.951 --> 02:10:01.670
you're faced with an uphill battle.

2300
02:10:01.671 --> 02:10:04.870
The nice thing with dogs were there were more forgiving and,

2301
02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.790
and pliable mentally than,
uh,
than our human.
Yeah.

2302
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.490
<v 3>Put them in the trunk of the car for a couple hours and you're still out,
right?</v>

2303
02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:13.040
Yeah.
Yup.
Then you've,

2304
02:10:13.110 --> 02:10:16.430
the transverse of that as it is if you show your dog that you're unflappable

2305
02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:19.280
when you consistently project an image of authority than your dog will

2306
02:10:19.281 --> 02:10:20.880
understanding and count on you.
So,

2307
02:10:20.890 --> 02:10:23.510
so don't lose your temper and don't do that as a leader either.

2308
02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:26.270
Here's another one that you throw in rewards.

2309
02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:28.730
Like corrections should be proportional.

2310
02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:34.190
The surest way to reduce the effectiveness of a reward is to overuse.
And that's

2311
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:37.760
<v 0>obviously true with people as well.
First of all,
if you're,</v>

2312
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:42.910
if you're not just with your punishment and somebody makes a small mistake and

2313
02:10:42.981 --> 02:10:47.450
you can hammer them destructively that's not helping you.
And at the same time,

2314
02:10:47.451 --> 02:10:50.540
if everything that they do good,
you're jumping up and down like a cheerleader,

2315
02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:52.640
that's not going to do you any good either.
And same with the dog.

2316
02:10:52.810 --> 02:10:56.890
<v 2>Sure.
And uh,
you know,
the,
the other thing that the varying the reward schedule,</v>

2317
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:58.660
um,
and also there's,

2318
02:10:58.870 --> 02:11:02.740
<v 0>you were echos all into variable rewards.
Yeah.
Right.
Isn't there some kind of,</v>

2319
02:11:02.890 --> 02:11:05.750
well there's this psychological hundred percent what the,
with dogs,
it's an,

2320
02:11:05.751 --> 02:11:09.060
it's an excuse you told me about something with,
with iPhones though.
Yeah.

2321
02:11:10.060 --> 02:11:13.300
Like you're looking for the little thing to pop up and you think maybe this is

2322
02:11:13.301 --> 02:11:17.170
the message from,
from whoever the president,

2323
02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:21.190
this is,
could be the one could be the one instead,

2324
02:11:21.191 --> 02:11:23.310
it's just an advertisement for something sometimes.

2325
02:11:23.650 --> 02:11:25.480
But one day it is a message from the president,

2326
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:28.630
but that keeps you in the game during the game.
How many of those have you done?

2327
02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:34.690
Yeah.
So you use variable rewards with the dogs.

2328
02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:37.230
<v 2>So with,
uh,
with training it's kind of,
again,</v>

2329
02:11:37.231 --> 02:11:40.860
it just falls into a cumulative process.
At first.
It's every time,
you know,

2330
02:11:40.861 --> 02:11:42.890
so that there's the consistencies that,
so that,
that,

2331
02:11:42.891 --> 02:11:46.800
that's the explanation of the expectation is that you do this,
you get that,

2332
02:11:46.801 --> 02:11:49.230
you do this,
you get that until now it's,
it's wired.

2333
02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:54.680
Once it's wired now it becomes just like if every time they pick anything,

2334
02:11:55.231 --> 02:11:58.290
pick anything you like,
you know,
every Friday we're having steak and ice cream.

2335
02:11:58.291 --> 02:12:02.190
Like after awhile it's like no stake in ice cream again.
So that,

2336
02:12:02.191 --> 02:12:05.100
that dog will get to a point where now it's actually,

2337
02:12:05.101 --> 02:12:08.670
we're not having stake in ice cream and having Tofu burgers joke's on you.

2338
02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:10.950
He's like,
wait,
what?
You know,

2339
02:12:10.951 --> 02:12:14.580
so now whatever it took that week to get steak in ice cream on Friday,

2340
02:12:14.581 --> 02:12:18.270
maybe I'm going to work a little harder and you'll see that out of them.
And so,

2341
02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:21.270
and this is more on the,
on the competitive side,
but you know,

2342
02:12:21.810 --> 02:12:25.830
when you're judged on,
on flashiness and precision and speed of execution,

2343
02:12:25.831 --> 02:12:28.680
when it comes to different behavioral components of obedience,

2344
02:12:28.681 --> 02:12:32.220
routines and people want to speed those up and make them more laser like in

2345
02:12:32.221 --> 02:12:35.310
their precision,
that's a very effective way to do it.
Is it now,

2346
02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:37.770
sometimes you get it,
sometimes you don't.
And so now the dog is,

2347
02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:41.100
it's the lottery mentality of doing scratch offs,
you know,
I mean,

2348
02:12:41.101 --> 02:12:45.000
nobody wins the powerball,
but the scratch offs,
it's like,
ah,
you know,

2349
02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:48.610
made 12 bucks.
Yeah.
You know,
I can almost by what I just spent on him,

2350
02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:53.310
I almost got my money back on by them again.
But,
but we're,
you know,

2351
02:12:53.311 --> 02:12:54.960
human beings are wired that same way.

2352
02:12:54.961 --> 02:12:56.850
How many people waste their money on scratch offs?

2353
02:12:56.851 --> 02:12:59.460
A bunch of them for that same reason.
It's,
it's a,

2354
02:12:59.461 --> 02:13:03.210
it's a psychological aspect that a,
that actually is very powerful and a dog.

2355
02:13:03.211 --> 02:13:07.320
But the caveat to that is that,
you know,
make sure that it's,

2356
02:13:07.321 --> 02:13:11.670
it's an ingrained,
conditioned response before you start doing that.
Um,

2357
02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:16.320
but yeah,
it is powerful in terms of the flooding.
Um,
when I,

2358
02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:19.830
when I'm bridging certain things together,
like if I want to go from,
you know,

2359
02:13:19.831 --> 02:13:21.000
I'll teach a dog to recall,

2360
02:13:21.001 --> 02:13:25.890
which has come to me first when I'm teaching him to get his backend into his

2361
02:13:25.891 --> 02:13:26.431
shoulder hits,

2362
02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:29.730
my knee's starting at kind of a healing position in the sitting position.

2363
02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:32.490
That's one component.
Then actually walking

2364
02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:37.060
<v 1>off and starting to heal when I want to bridge all of that together.
So,
you know,</v>

2365
02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:40.170
if I just give him the,
the,
what I call it plots command,

2366
02:13:40.171 --> 02:13:45.000
which is Dutch for place,
is it the dog?
You know,
it,
it does all of that,
you know,

2367
02:13:45.001 --> 02:13:46.860
he comes here,
he gets into the plots and then we,

2368
02:13:46.861 --> 02:13:50.610
and then we heal off basically when,
when I bridge certain things together,

2369
02:13:50.611 --> 02:13:53.130
if I've been building a couple of different components,
then when,

2370
02:13:53.150 --> 02:13:57.570
when it clicks the very first time,
I'll flood five,
six,
seven rewards all,

2371
02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:02.030
all right at,
at,
at,
at once.
So that he's like,
oh,
paydays and Jack Jackpot.

2372
02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:06.120
Uh,
and again,
so it's,
it's kind of a,

2373
02:14:06.121 --> 02:14:11.010
almost a successive approximation in terms of,
you know,
teaching different,

2374
02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:11.970
different steps,

2375
02:14:11.971 --> 02:14:15.990
no different than in Jujitsu and different elements of a move or whatever.

2376
02:14:15.991 --> 02:14:18.930
And then once it's paired altogether,
now they get the tap out and they're like,

2377
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:23.510
sweet,
you know,
same,
same type of type of thing.
Yes.
Dig,
dig,
dig,
dig,
dig,
dig.
Uh,

2378
02:14:24.210 --> 02:14:28.830
back to the book.
Beware that your dog has no concept of what words mean.

2379
02:14:29.250 --> 02:14:32.730
In other words,
if you repeatedly say that word down as in,
down,
down,
down,

2380
02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:37.680
your dog will associate that more link free expression as is cute or lie down.

2381
02:14:37.890 --> 02:14:41.370
Keep it simple and clear.
Simple,
clear,
concise language.
I did that.

2382
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:44.340
You talk about in the book I did the Broccoli thing with my,
with my dog,

2383
02:14:44.341 --> 02:14:48.030
with my wife,
and she was all shocked,
you know,
because I was like,
Hey,
your dog,

2384
02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:50.460
you know,
even though you think your dog knows what you're saying,

2385
02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:53.400
he actually has no idea.
And then when you talk about in the book,

2386
02:14:53.401 --> 02:14:57.300
and I did with my dog,
uh,
yesterday,
I said,
Hey,
our dog has no idea what he's,

2387
02:14:57.390 --> 02:14:58.920
what we're saying,
which is,
what do you mean?
I said,

2388
02:14:58.921 --> 02:15:01.590
he doesn't know what sit means.
She said,
what do you mean?
I said,
watch this.

2389
02:15:02.070 --> 02:15:05.280
And so I gave him to come.
He came over and I said,
Broccoli.

2390
02:15:05.310 --> 02:15:07.320
And he sat right down,
just like I said it.

2391
02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:10.710
And she was all looking at all confused and I said,
yeah,
that's right.

2392
02:15:10.770 --> 02:15:11.620
These dogs don't know what,

2393
02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:15.660
but it's the body language and it's the expectations and whatever little subtle

2394
02:15:15.661 --> 02:15:18.660
cues I have when I want him to sit,
I did it and I just,

2395
02:15:18.661 --> 02:15:23.370
the word came out of my mouth.
It was Broccoli context,
100%.
What dogs are,

2396
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:26.760
you know,
the,
the beauty of dogs is,
is how powerful context,

2397
02:15:26.761 --> 02:15:30.720
the Achilles heel is also context for that same reason.
But,

2398
02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:35.730
um,
yeah,
it's,
uh,
it's important to,
to make that distinction.
And that's where,

2399
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:37.500
uh,
you know,
using,

2400
02:15:37.530 --> 02:15:42.000
using that shaping of behavior is your best friend in terms of,
uh,
you know,

2401
02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:43.530
like I said,
I use a classroom,
you know,

2402
02:15:43.531 --> 02:15:46.740
there's a reason why libraries and classrooms are the environments that they
are.

2403
02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:48.780
So when we teach our kids what we want them to know,

2404
02:15:48.781 --> 02:15:51.990
it's a distraction free environment.
You know,
the positive learning experience.

2405
02:15:52.530 --> 02:15:56.010
It's a,
it's a petri dish for education,
uh,
when,

2406
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:59.430
when you try to do things where,
you know,

2407
02:15:59.431 --> 02:16:02.970
the dog is in the house and doing all these other things,
um,
you know,

2408
02:16:02.971 --> 02:16:06.450
there's all these other stimuli going on and it's distracting and the dog's not

2409
02:16:06.451 --> 02:16:08.310
picking it up and it's not building that context.

2410
02:16:08.311 --> 02:16:11.370
So I use a 40 by 40 training classroom.
It's just a,

2411
02:16:11.371 --> 02:16:13.590
it's a fenced in area with nothing in it.

2412
02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:16.920
And we go in there and I just stand there and wait for him to start doing stuff.

2413
02:16:16.921 --> 02:16:18.870
And then I mark it and reward it and shape it.

2414
02:16:18.871 --> 02:16:23.190
And then from there I start to shape a little micro nuanced.
You know,

2415
02:16:23.191 --> 02:16:27.240
the dog just turns his head.
Well,
you know,
a fraction of a degree,
one,
uh,

2416
02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:30.280
one direction I marked that and rewarded.
If I'm trying to teach a place command,

2417
02:16:30.281 --> 02:16:32.590
he looks at the bed,
I marketing roared,
he takes one step.

2418
02:16:32.591 --> 02:16:35.680
I'm mark and reward and I just build on that over and over and over.

2419
02:16:35.681 --> 02:16:39.040
And the neat thing is once they,
dogs kind of have to learn how to learn.

2420
02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:43.870
That way you'll see that light bulb go on.
As soon as they understand,
okay,

2421
02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.690
you have what I want and I have to earn it,

2422
02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:48.970
I have to figure out what it's going to take to get it.

2423
02:16:48.971 --> 02:16:53.971
And they start to offer these raw offered behaviors through self discovery then

2424
02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:58.420
then that is when you own their mind and you can teach them anything.
Uh,

2425
02:16:58.630 --> 02:17:01.510
and that's one of the first things I teach is,
is a place command for that.

2426
02:17:01.511 --> 02:17:04.240
That simple reason alone is that it's so powerful and a dog,

2427
02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:06.400
if he can look at me and he goes,

2428
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:11.080
dude has what I want and I have to actually go away from it to get it then,

2429
02:17:11.081 --> 02:17:11.914
then it's,
it's on

2430
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:16.790
<v 0>each step.
And I know this question's going to get asked all the time.
Uh,</v>

2431
02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.220
but you put it in here.

2432
02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:21.970
Not only is it possible to teach your dogs to perform tricks,

2433
02:17:21.971 --> 02:17:24.370
but I believe you should regardless of the dog's age.

2434
02:17:24.371 --> 02:17:27.820
So you can in fact teach an old dog new tricks,

2435
02:17:27.890 --> 02:17:32.840
which is a everybody's question.
Yeah.
Everyone old.
What about puppy?
Yeah.

2436
02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:33.700
Do you,

2437
02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:36.300
do you fill up the hard drive at some point where they can't learn anything new

2438
02:17:36.350 --> 02:17:37.510
without forgetting something else?

2439
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:42.170
<v 1>Not anymore than any of us.
You know,
they,
they can learn.
They can,
they can,</v>

2440
02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:44.360
we'll continue to learn.
And to me,

2441
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:48.740
one of the reasons dogs as with people expire earlier than they probably need to

2442
02:17:48.741 --> 02:17:53.420
is because of lack of,
of that stimulation,
that mental stimulation.
Um,
you know,

2443
02:17:53.421 --> 02:17:56.810
even if the mind or even if the body can't,
can't perform,

2444
02:17:56.811 --> 02:18:00.140
there's a lot of other ways that you can get dogs to stimulate their mind and,

2445
02:18:00.141 --> 02:18:03.200
and keep them,
uh,
the younger and healthier and happier than,

2446
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:06.710
than just letting them expire on a dog bed.
You know,
five feet away from you

2447
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:13.870
<v 0>letting your heart get too much in the way of your head and what's best for your</v>

2448
02:18:14.181 --> 02:18:17.750
dog will end up causing that heart more pain in the long run.

2449
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:20.600
Discipline equals freedom.
Amen.
Right.

2450
02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:23.330
I've been with you have an undisciplined dog,
that dog's going to be miserable.

2451
02:18:23.331 --> 02:18:25.430
You're going to be miserable.
Everything sucks.

2452
02:18:25.510 --> 02:18:30.210
<v 1>Yeah,
pretty much.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean it's uh,
like I said,
I mean the,</v>

2453
02:18:30.330 --> 02:18:34.480
the,
that's one of my big goals moving into this year is,
um,

2454
02:18:34.570 --> 02:18:39.430
is basically starting like a shelter campaign of signing up for the online

2455
02:18:39.431 --> 02:18:42.880
training,
saving a dog and,
and uh,
we're going to be launching it here real soon.

2456
02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:46.870
But,
um,
you know,
I,
I firmly believe,
you know,

2457
02:18:46.871 --> 02:18:48.820
whether you want to call it a calling or whatever is that,
you know,

2458
02:18:48.821 --> 02:18:49.720
my goal is to,

2459
02:18:49.721 --> 02:18:54.721
is to revolutionize how your average everyday dog owner views communicates with

2460
02:18:55.301 --> 02:18:56.190
and interacts with her

2461
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:59.100
<v 0>dog.
Because how many dogs a year gets sent to the pound?</v>

2462
02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:04.070
<v 1>3.3 million dogs every year get surrendered to shelters across this country.</v>

2463
02:19:04.071 --> 02:19:05.930
And it varies year to year,

2464
02:19:05.931 --> 02:19:10.931
but usually between six and 680 and 750,000 dogs a year get euthanized.

2465
02:19:11.811 --> 02:19:15.890
That's over 2000 dogs every day getting put to sleep in this country.

2466
02:19:15.891 --> 02:19:18.890
Even at those numbers,
you know,
and it's,
it's not as bad as it as it was,

2467
02:19:18.891 --> 02:19:22.670
but it's still astronomically high.
And the way I look at it very simply as it,

2468
02:19:22.671 --> 02:19:27.020
you know,
shelters,
God bless him,
um,
are great,
great resources.

2469
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:31.160
We as Americans,
very charitable.
Uh,
I've opened up our hearts and wallets and,

2470
02:19:31.161 --> 02:19:36.100
and provided pretty astounding resources for animals,
whether it's ASP c,
h,

2471
02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:41.050
s,
u,
s,
whatever,
shelters,
rescue organizations,
you name it.
But to me,
it's,

2472
02:19:41.051 --> 02:19:45.330
it's,
it's no different than throwing money at the symptom.
You know,

2473
02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:46.990
it's not addressing the problem.
You know,

2474
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.220
the problem is why are they getting there in the first place?

2475
02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:52.530
Because with 83 million dogs out there,
uh,

2476
02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:56.530
you can't have enough resources to,
to accommodate that,
you know?
And so it's,

2477
02:19:56.531 --> 02:20:00.840
it's like,
uh,
it's like the,
uh,
the pharmaceutical industry,
you know,
it's,
it's,

2478
02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:04.560
it's dealing with the symptoms and not trying to fix,
fix the problem,
you know,

2479
02:20:04.561 --> 02:20:04.720
and,
uh,

2480
02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:09.080
of course there is potentially some politics involved with that in terms of

2481
02:20:09.081 --> 02:20:13.790
maintaining funding and salaries and jobs.
I get all that,
but,
uh,
to me,
uh,

2482
02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:18.770
shelters,
number one goal should be to have zero dogs in it.
Um,
you know,
if,

2483
02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:21.180
if you're not,
if that's not your goal,
you're wrong and I'll,
I'll,

2484
02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:24.650
I'll call any one of them out.
Uh,
right now.
Uh,
you know,

2485
02:20:24.651 --> 02:20:28.970
your goal should be to be out of a job in,
in my opinion.
You know,
and,
and to me,

2486
02:20:28.971 --> 02:20:33.890
that starts with,
um,
with teaching people how to communicate with their dogs.

2487
02:20:33.891 --> 02:20:36.470
And it's everything that we've talked about,
but,
uh,
it's,

2488
02:20:36.471 --> 02:20:39.560
it's really not that complicated.
Um,
you know,
and,
and the,

2489
02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:44.420
the gratification you get from doing it yourself and the understanding of your

2490
02:20:44.421 --> 02:20:48.590
dog and it,
it transcends just that,
you know,
just like,
you know,
with what you,

2491
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:50.510
what you do.
Um,
you know,

2492
02:20:50.511 --> 02:20:53.360
you can take all of these same lessons and apply them to your kids,

2493
02:20:53.361 --> 02:20:57.500
to your spouse,
to your business partners,
to your employees,
whatever.
Um,
and,

2494
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:58.850
and it all works the same way.

2495
02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:01.170
<v 3>Yeah.
We're going to close out the book.</v>

2496
02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:04.500
I'm just gonna run through these fundamental principles you have.

2497
02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:08.310
And as I'm saying them,
think about not just dogs,

2498
02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:11.880
but everyone that doesn't have a dog.
Think about people,

2499
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.180
anyone that's in a leadership position.

2500
02:21:14.190 --> 02:21:17.070
Think about leading those people as it applies.
Docs.

2501
02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:21.270
One,
look at things from the dog's perspective.

2502
02:21:21.330 --> 02:21:23.850
How often does it we get a somebody that works for us and we don't think about

2503
02:21:23.851 --> 02:21:26.310
what's going through their brain and why,
what we're saying,
how,

2504
02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:29.070
what we're saying to them or how,
what we're making them do impacts them.

2505
02:21:30.390 --> 02:21:33.750
Appreciate the differences in how dogs use their senses to perceive the world.

2506
02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:38.130
Same thing.
Think about the people that you've got working for.
You.

2507
02:21:38.850 --> 02:21:40.950
Look at the intelligence behind the mistake.
You already,

2508
02:21:40.951 --> 02:21:44.760
you already talked about that reward,
good behavior.
Uh,
Duh.

2509
02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:50.130
But how often do we not do that as a leader?
Punish or extinguish bad behavior.

2510
02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:54.720
Duh.
Again,
but how often do we let little things slide?
We just,

2511
02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:57.660
if you're letting things slide,
if somebody wants to be late day after day,

2512
02:21:57.810 --> 02:21:59.730
oh that's okay.
We're saying it's okay.

2513
02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:05.100
Next be consistent in the application of awards and punishment.
Well,

2514
02:22:05.101 --> 02:22:07.740
there you go.
This is especially true with kids.

2515
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:13.740
If you're not consistent with the kids,
like they don't learn.
And,

2516
02:22:13.770 --> 02:22:16.590
and I think opposite of dogs actually a kid,

2517
02:22:16.591 --> 02:22:19.630
if they think they can get away with it once,
like a variable reward,

2518
02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:22.440
variable punishment,
they think they're going to gamble there.

2519
02:22:22.450 --> 02:22:26.250
They can get away with it.
Again,
dogs,
all dogs,
we'll test the water

2520
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:28.990
<v 0>on your pretty hard that way too.
A lot of them are more,</v>

2521
02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:32.960
more intuitive and sharp than you think.
But uh,
um,

2522
02:22:33.210 --> 02:22:34.170
keep emotion out of the,

2523
02:22:34.171 --> 02:22:37.470
of an evaluation of good and bad and the application of punishment.

2524
02:22:37.530 --> 02:22:39.830
This is super smart if,

2525
02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:43.290
especially with kids and with employees and with dogs.

2526
02:22:43.291 --> 02:22:46.530
But if you're punishing the people or your workers or your employees or your

2527
02:22:46.531 --> 02:22:49.110
dogs out of anger,
you're,
you're not doing a good job.

2528
02:22:49.350 --> 02:22:52.710
You're not doing a good job.
In fact,

2529
02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:56.970
just Fyi,
when I have to do punishment with my kids,

2530
02:22:57.150 --> 02:23:01.680
I do it in like the most cold blooded serial murderer kind of way that I can the

2531
02:23:01.681 --> 02:23:06.210
bloods instructor as if this isn't completely emotionless as like,
well,
you know,

2532
02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:08.700
unfortunately I have to do this because if your behavior,

2533
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:11.730
so go ahead and report to the garage,

2534
02:23:13.610 --> 02:23:15.510
you know,
so they're going to get,
they're going to get hammered,

2535
02:23:15.570 --> 02:23:18.170
but I think that's better.
Oh,
it's far more impactful,
you know?

2536
02:23:18.250 --> 02:23:20.880
I mean think about above the instructor,
like none of them really scream at you.

2537
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:25.820
Yeah.
That's the,
that's the,
the antithesis of the,
of the Marine Corps Dai.

2538
02:23:25.890 --> 02:23:28.650
Like it's just white noise at that point.
Just standing there like,
yeah,
whatever.

2539
02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.420
When that dude's like whispering,

2540
02:23:30.421 --> 02:23:33.840
like I'm going gonna I'm going to snatch the life out of your soul,

2541
02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:37.860
crushing right in front of your face.
And the kids are like 18 years old,

2542
02:23:37.861 --> 02:23:39.360
blown his anal glands like Jesus,

2543
02:23:39.361 --> 02:23:43.920
what did I sign up for a next,

2544
02:23:43.921 --> 02:23:48.090
understand how dogs communicate overwhelmingly through body language and use

2545
02:23:48.091 --> 02:23:51.810
that understanding and method of communication back to them to elicit the kinds

2546
02:23:51.811 --> 02:23:53.890
of behaviors we want.
And we,
we,

2547
02:23:53.980 --> 02:23:56.700
we talked about this before on the podcast and know you've probably heard this

2548
02:23:56.701 --> 02:24:00.810
before,
but they say humans,
humans communicate,

2549
02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:04.650
even though we're all verbal and all that,
it's an 80% is nonverbal.

2550
02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:08.400
80% is nonverbal.
But this is,
I don't know,
probably someone will say,
no,

2551
02:24:08.401 --> 02:24:13.090
it's not 80,
it's 78,
but it's a huge percentage is nonverbal.
Well,
to me,

2552
02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:16.520
to me where I think,
uh,
you know,
not to get too off track,
but we're,

2553
02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:19.500
where the disparity is,
is that in with technology,

2554
02:24:19.501 --> 02:24:23.610
so much of our communication doesn't involve interaction,
right.
You know,

2555
02:24:23.611 --> 02:24:26.670
it's emails,
it's text messages,
even it's phone calls,
whatever,
you know.

2556
02:24:26.671 --> 02:24:30.510
So I think in person maybe,
um,
you know,

2557
02:24:30.511 --> 02:24:35.040
but because there's such that so watered down by,
by everything,
you know,

2558
02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:38.690
people do this.
I mean,
I've been working with businesses all the time.
We,

2559
02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:42.570
I uncover all kinds of people that have all kinds of problems because they're

2560
02:24:42.571 --> 02:24:45.720
only communicating through email or through text and therefore the people aren't

2561
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:48.750
picking up on all those other signals that we have relationships that get

2562
02:24:48.751 --> 02:24:50.140
destroyed.
Because,
you know,

2563
02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:53.570
I made a joke to you about something and it was in a text message and,

2564
02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:58.170
and I didn't put a lol
Emoji after it.

2565
02:24:58.171 --> 02:25:00.360
So you didn't think I was joking and all of a sudden we got an issue.

2566
02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:04.320
So this is definitely something that we have to remember.

2567
02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:05.910
That's why I have like a rule in emails.

2568
02:25:05.970 --> 02:25:08.340
I don't joke around in emails like I don't,
I don't know,

2569
02:25:08.341 --> 02:25:12.180
make jokes in emails unless I just completely,
if we know each other and we,

2570
02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:16.230
we can get,
we get there,
but I'm not joking around,
you know,
if I have a client,

2571
02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:18.840
I'm not saying,
uh,
you know,

2572
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:25.070
I'll be there in a few weeks and hopefully I'll be able to your ass out there.

2573
02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:27.490
They're like,
wait,
wait a second.
Even though I'd be kidding.

2574
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.620
But they don't know that through the email,
back to the book,

2575
02:25:32.621 --> 02:25:37.621
determine our needs and understand how a dog's prey drive energy level and other

2576
02:25:37.871 --> 02:25:42.160
physical traits contribute to a matrix of behavior.
What does that say?
No.

2577
02:25:42.161 --> 02:25:46.780
Your people know your people.
What's driving them?
What are they motivated by?

2578
02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:50.890
What's going to make them work harder?
Next,

2579
02:25:50.891 --> 02:25:54.790
provide a dog with ample amounts of exercise and interaction with other dogs and

2580
02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:56.680
people in a multitude of different environments.

2581
02:25:56.681 --> 02:26:00.850
What I liked about that is the APP,
the obviously exercise interaction,

2582
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:02.830
multiple of different environments.

2583
02:26:02.831 --> 02:26:05.830
This is where I see people that are in a training capacity.

2584
02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:09.490
They train people only in one environment and so they get outside of that

2585
02:26:09.491 --> 02:26:10.360
environment.
They fall apart,

2586
02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:17.830
feed him a diet with maximum health benefits within our means.
Hey,
right.

2587
02:26:17.890 --> 02:26:22.160
Eat good food.
Steak.
Yeah.
Basically we know,

2588
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:26.830
we all know what we're referring to.
I brought home some of my Bros gave me a uh,

2589
02:26:27.310 --> 02:26:32.060
cow femur the other day.
I brought it home for my dog.
Just a raw cow.
Femur.

2590
02:26:32.590 --> 02:26:34.780
You want to talk about a pumped up dog?
Rock and roll.

2591
02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:38.320
He's still just getting after that thing.
That's what nature intended

2592
02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:42.070
before.
Undergoing formal training.

2593
02:26:42.130 --> 02:26:45.940
Develop a bond of mutual trust and respect,

2594
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.570
so get that relationship going before you demand a bunch of stuff from people.

2595
02:26:50.530 --> 02:26:53.350
Become the authority figure in a dog's life that he wants a needs.

2596
02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:56.620
Take the time to be patient.
Do multiple repetitions,

2597
02:26:56.621 --> 02:27:00.810
building different levels of distraction and employee variable reward schedules,

2598
02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:04.270
all to ensure that a concept is firmly embedded in dogs mind.

2599
02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:06.910
Now we'll talk a little bit about Jujitsu here.

2600
02:27:07.690 --> 02:27:10.810
You got to do the repetition and then you've got to do it in different,
you know,

2601
02:27:10.811 --> 02:27:12.820
you,
you,
you,
you gotta,
you gotta arm lock.

2602
02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:18.340
You got to try an arm lock live rolling a hundred times before you get one,

2603
02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:22.540
at least a hundred maybe more.
And in order to shorten that time,

2604
02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:25.810
you got to do more drills and then you can shorten that time from a hundred

2605
02:27:25.811 --> 02:27:28.150
maybe you only got to do it at 44 times before it works.

2606
02:27:28.310 --> 02:27:32.020
You think about when you learn a new move in Jujitsu,
it can take a long time.

2607
02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:35.710
The better.
You understand it in the isolated training environment,

2608
02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:37.180
the quicker you gonna be able to do it live

2609
02:27:38.670 --> 02:27:41.180
<v 1>well.
And from a behavioral standpoint,
it's the same thing.</v>

2610
02:27:41.181 --> 02:27:44.270
Like teach it in that sterile classroom and then move it into the living

2611
02:27:44.271 --> 02:27:48.350
environment and going out for walks,
going past dog parks,
you know,
busy.
Yup.

2612
02:27:48.770 --> 02:27:50.990
Playgrounds,
whatever is it,
you know,
people are like,
yeah,

2613
02:27:50.991 --> 02:27:52.040
he's doing great in the classroom.

2614
02:27:52.041 --> 02:27:53.950
And then I take him to the park and he just loses his mind.
Like,

2615
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:58.790
where did you bridge that?
You can't go from third grade to to,

2616
02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:02.450
you know,
a sophomore in college and that's what you're doing.
Like you're,

2617
02:28:02.451 --> 02:28:06.020
you're not,
you're missed.
You missed about 15 steps in between there,
you know.

2618
02:28:06.021 --> 02:28:10.560
So my dog was distracted in Walmart.
No kidding.
Yeah,
idiot.

2619
02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:11.673
Yeah.

2620
02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:13.870
<v 0>Next use.</v>

2621
02:28:13.871 --> 02:28:18.700
Good problem solving skills to identify the root cause of a problem and work out

2622
02:28:18.701 --> 02:28:22.400
the solution to resolve the issue and not just hide it.

2623
02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:25.670
I,
I'll another thing,

2624
02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:29.390
you see this in relationships and companies where they just,

2625
02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:32.600
everyone is hiding this problem.
No one will address the problem.

2626
02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:35.120
No one's going to address the problem.
So if you've got problems,

2627
02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:37.010
default aggressive,
get aggressive,

2628
02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:38.790
find a solution to the problem and implement it.

2629
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:43.220
That kind of wraps up this book.

2630
02:28:43.270 --> 02:28:48.230
I'm like I said,
team dog is the name of the book,
how to train your dog,

2631
02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:49.730
the navy seal way

2632
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:56.420
and good stuff in there,
not just for dogs but for humans as well.

2633
02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.480
And Mike obviously appreciate your service and not only what you did when you

2634
02:29:02.001 --> 02:29:02.451
were in the teams,

2635
02:29:02.451 --> 02:29:06.590
but everything you've done and did once you got out of the teams.

2636
02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:09.020
And thanks for coming on the podcast now.

2637
02:29:09.021 --> 02:29:10.610
I know you've got a bunch of things going on right now.

2638
02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:14.590
<v 1>Yeah.
Well first off,
I appreciate you having me on.
It's uh,
it's an honor and uh,</v>

2639
02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:18.810
uh,
happy to,
happy to do it.
Um,
yeah,
in terms of everything I have going on,

2640
02:29:18.811 --> 02:29:22.550
I mean the,
to me,
the crux of what I would pass on to,

2641
02:29:22.610 --> 02:29:26.040
to anybody listening is,
is again,
is,
is the,

2642
02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:31.110
is really trying to get to the root core of,
of communicating with your dog.
And,

2643
02:29:31.111 --> 02:29:34.080
and you know,
to me,
if,
if nothing else,

2644
02:29:34.530 --> 02:29:38.700
let it be an experiment and practice for the rest of your relationships,

2645
02:29:38.730 --> 02:29:43.230
you know,
uh,
because it,
it does transpire or transcend rather,
um,

2646
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:46.230
you know,
just,
just training a dog.
But,
um,

2647
02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:51.240
the online training just a month by month,
you look,
they can go to team dog.pet,

2648
02:29:51.890 --> 02:29:53.820
uh,
to check that out.
It's,

2649
02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:56.590
<v 0>you know,
team dog.cat.
Dot.</v>

2650
02:29:56.770 --> 02:30:01.330
That's where you have online training where people can learn to solve these

2651
02:30:01.331 --> 02:30:03.850
problems that they have with a dog or build a good relationship with her dog and

2652
02:30:03.851 --> 02:30:04.530
train their dog.

2653
02:30:04.530 --> 02:30:07.260
<v 1>Yeah,
just,
it's a monthly lesson.
It's a cumulative process.</v>

2654
02:30:07.261 --> 02:30:09.180
It starts out just like everything we talked about,

2655
02:30:09.181 --> 02:30:10.470
building the relationship first,

2656
02:30:10.590 --> 02:30:13.980
shaping and reinforcing behavior and then working on an extinguishing,
things,

2657
02:30:13.981 --> 02:30:17.000
correcting problems,
et cetera.
We're in,
uh,
the,

2658
02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:20.400
the halfway through the second year of it.
Um,
and it's,
it's gone.

2659
02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:23.040
Gotten some really good feedback.
There's forums that has,

2660
02:30:23.550 --> 02:30:27.510
I get on there and I answer questions every Monday,
uh,
with,
uh,
with all the,

2661
02:30:27.511 --> 02:30:30.150
all the,
the members and the people interact with each other.

2662
02:30:30.151 --> 02:30:34.200
And give each other advice and post videos and a bunch of other stuff.

2663
02:30:34.201 --> 02:30:37.950
We're going to launch some affiliate partnership programs here with the,

2664
02:30:37.951 --> 02:30:39.750
with people getting other people to sign up soon.

2665
02:30:39.751 --> 02:30:44.430
But that in conjunction with the book and then launching a Trackos training

2666
02:30:44.431 --> 02:30:45.360
franchises,

2667
02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:49.050
which are going to augment all of the people out there that are subscribers.

2668
02:30:49.050 --> 02:30:50.640
So basically,
you know,

2669
02:30:50.641 --> 02:30:55.350
it's working with certified Trackos and team dog trainers all over the country

2670
02:30:55.351 --> 02:30:57.810
that have these franchises everywhere,
uh,

2671
02:30:57.811 --> 02:31:01.880
that help you go through this monthly training curriculum.
And,
uh,
you know,
the,

2672
02:31:01.881 --> 02:31:04.260
the crux of it though is,
you know,
just like with anything,

2673
02:31:04.261 --> 02:31:05.300
you need help from some people.

2674
02:31:05.301 --> 02:31:08.760
You need guidance with learning Olympic lifts or Jujitsu moves or whatever.

2675
02:31:08.761 --> 02:31:12.570
But you mean you have to put the time in yourself.
But this will allow people to,

2676
02:31:12.571 --> 02:31:14.450
uh,
you know,
to,
to seek some,

2677
02:31:14.451 --> 02:31:17.550
some guidance in person from people if they're having specific issues or

2678
02:31:17.551 --> 02:31:20.370
whatever that they're not able to get from the online stuff.

2679
02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:22.050
But we've had just overwhelming feed,

2680
02:31:22.051 --> 02:31:25.800
positive feedback on success story after success story and know these 65 year

2681
02:31:25.801 --> 02:31:28.910
old grandmothers that have their labradoodle out there,
you know,

2682
02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:32.010
healing and walking around dog parks and stuff and they're just loving it.

2683
02:31:32.011 --> 02:31:36.890
It's been pretty awesome.
But,
um,
so that's,
uh,
that's kind of the big,
big thing.

2684
02:31:36.940 --> 02:31:38.070
<v 0>And He's talks about trike goes,</v>

2685
02:31:38.071 --> 02:31:39.960
I don't even know if we talked about Tricoci Cosia trickles.

2686
02:31:39.961 --> 02:31:43.320
Is the company that you formed up while you were still in?

2687
02:31:43.580 --> 02:31:47.250
<v 1>No.
Uh,
so this is actually my second dog company,
but,
uh,</v>

2688
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:52.010
formed it a little over five years ago.
Um,
and it's the,
the crux of it is,

2689
02:31:52.011 --> 02:31:56.480
is a personal protection.
Dogs,
police,
dogs,
military dogs,
we do sell it,

2690
02:31:56.481 --> 02:32:00.440
but for a fair number of dogs to private individuals for,
uh,
you know,

2691
02:32:00.441 --> 02:32:01.880
the personal protection aspect.

2692
02:32:01.881 --> 02:32:04.580
And that's kind of what it was born and bred out of.

2693
02:32:04.581 --> 02:32:08.420
And in conjunction with putting on a lot of police seminars and selling police

2694
02:32:08.421 --> 02:32:13.220
dogs and teaching at conferences and stuff like that.
But,
um,
but,
uh,

2695
02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:15.890
yeah,
so that's,
that's my for profit company.
If,
if you,

2696
02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:18.830
in terms of everything that I have going on in the best place to go is just

2697
02:32:18.831 --> 02:32:23.831
[inaudible] dot com that is the resource that talks about the team dog online

2698
02:32:24.021 --> 02:32:28.790
stuff,
the Tracko stuff,
the speaking engagements to book for that or uh,
you know,

2699
02:32:28.791 --> 02:32:31.490
the franchise stuff coming up or even the warrior dog foundation.

2700
02:32:31.491 --> 02:32:32.860
The books that I've written,
it's kind of a,

2701
02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:36.860
a landing page of everything that I have going on.
mike.com

2702
02:32:36.890 --> 02:32:39.530
<v 0>and the warrior dog foundation.
Again,
you mentioned a couple times,</v>

2703
02:32:39.531 --> 02:32:44.450
but just give a little bit of a,
of a,
of a plug for that too.

2704
02:32:44.451 --> 02:32:45.470
People know what it is.

2705
02:32:45.590 --> 02:32:50.290
<v 1>So Warrior Dog Foundation,
uh,
we started it back in August of 2010.
Um,</v>

2706
02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:53.150
and we've taken and a little over 80 dogs at this point.
Um,

2707
02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:57.770
started off with just doing special operations dogs,
be at seal dogs,
rangers,

2708
02:32:57.771 --> 02:33:01.670
whatever.
Uh,
and we've taken in a lot of police dogs,
contract working dogs,

2709
02:33:01.671 --> 02:33:05.360
military working dogs and uh,
kind of our main,

2710
02:33:05.390 --> 02:33:08.570
main goal and function with that is to act as a,

2711
02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:12.440
as an indefinite sanctuary for those dogs.
First and foremost when we get 'em in,

2712
02:33:12.441 --> 02:33:14.780
we evaluate them.
Some of them we've been able to repurpose,

2713
02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:18.020
rehabilitate and get to police departments and you know,

2714
02:33:18.021 --> 02:33:20.630
some of them have come in and spend a few months and then we've gotten them back

2715
02:33:20.631 --> 02:33:22.850
to back to service,
was working with them and,

2716
02:33:22.851 --> 02:33:25.730
and kind of unwinding their mind a little bit using a lot of the same principles

2717
02:33:25.731 --> 02:33:29.250
that we've been talking about today.
Um,
but more than anything is that,
you know,

2718
02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:31.880
these dogs are at that kind of where their last resort,
you know,

2719
02:33:31.881 --> 02:33:35.990
they were going to get the blue juice here within days and we step in and take

2720
02:33:35.991 --> 02:33:38.660
them and either just,
you know,

2721
02:33:38.690 --> 02:33:41.600
continually try to rehabilitate them to where we can either rehome them to a

2722
02:33:41.601 --> 02:33:44.240
civilian application or another police department or whatever.

2723
02:33:44.600 --> 02:33:47.390
Or we just let them live out their life,
be a dog,

2724
02:33:47.391 --> 02:33:51.110
have fun chase balls and run around the woods and,
and hang out and,

2725
02:33:51.250 --> 02:33:53.870
and retire and uh,
out to pasture so to speak.

2726
02:33:53.871 --> 02:33:58.871
But a warrior dog foundation.org is the website for that if you want to check it

2727
02:33:59.061 --> 02:34:03.560
out.
And of course we're,
we're always gracious and appreciative of,

2728
02:34:03.561 --> 02:34:04.394
of any support.

2729
02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:06.740
<v 0>If there's someone that listens to this podcast,</v>

2730
02:34:06.741 --> 02:34:10.600
it gets all fired up to get a dog.
Um,
obviously get the book,

2731
02:34:10.601 --> 02:34:11.381
I'm going to tell you that right now.

2732
02:34:11.381 --> 02:34:14.920
Get the books so you can make a good assessment,
make a good judgment.

2733
02:34:15.460 --> 02:34:17.770
And um,
think

2734
02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:22.990
<v 3>there's a lot of work to have a dog.
I have four kids,
I've had dogs,</v>

2735
02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:26.560
multiple dogs.
When I had a bunch of kids,

2736
02:34:26.561 --> 02:34:30.820
we actually didn't have dogs for awhile cause kids and dogs are a lot of work.

2737
02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:34.450
If you're not willing to put the work into the dog,
then that's,

2738
02:34:34.570 --> 02:34:37.240
you're not going to be a good parent.
Is that the right way?
No,

2739
02:34:37.241 --> 02:34:40.240
you're not gonna be a good dog owner.
So I almost,
I almost went sideways there,

2740
02:34:40.650 --> 02:34:45.400
so yeah,
you're not,
you're going to be a bad dog.
Daddy.
Daddy.

2741
02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:49.590
Yeah.
You're not going to be a good dog owner.
And believe me,
I had to find,

2742
02:34:49.591 --> 02:34:54.160
I got three daughters and one son and for the years of me beating them down

2743
02:34:54.370 --> 02:34:57.160
saying no dog,
no dog,
no dog.

2744
02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:01.750
Because I knew that I couldn't put enough time and effort into it to make it a

2745
02:35:01.751 --> 02:35:02.584
dog,

2746
02:35:02.650 --> 02:35:06.850
have a good life and the dog be squared away and be disciplined and be able to

2747
02:35:07.090 --> 02:35:10.090
protect my family.
So it took a while to get there.

2748
02:35:10.091 --> 02:35:12.070
But then finally when my kids were old enough,
you know,

2749
02:35:12.071 --> 02:35:15.670
I got one out of the house and now we have a good environment for it.

2750
02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:18.040
And so think about that before you run out and buy a dog.

2751
02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:22.830
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
absolutely.
I mean,
it's a,
it's like with anything,
you know,
um,
don't,</v>

2752
02:35:22.831 --> 02:35:27.570
don't do impulse decisions.
Do your due diligence and research and uh,
just like,

2753
02:35:27.571 --> 02:35:30.540
you wouldn't just say,
oh,
let's adopt a kid and see what happens.
You know,

2754
02:35:32.030 --> 02:35:36.120
don't add,
don't do the same thing with the dog.
Yeah.
I'm bored.
It's Friday night.

2755
02:35:36.121 --> 02:35:39.540
Let's go to the,
let's go to the shelter and pick up a new dog.
Not a good call.

2756
02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:42.330
<v 3>Not a good call.
All right,
Echo.
Um,</v>

2757
02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:45.690
we've learned a lot about how to help dogs and train dogs.

2758
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.840
Maybe you could tell us how [inaudible]

2759
02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:48.360
<v 1>we can help ourselves a little bit.</v>

2760
02:35:49.410 --> 02:35:53.430
Is it true that no dogs don't have a personality.

2761
02:35:53.431 --> 02:35:56.560
They have a dog [inaudible] get it.
Um,

2762
02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:03.540
I just meet that are currently,
hey,
but that's okay.

2763
02:36:03.850 --> 02:36:07.600
Tucker minute.
I need to work on the operant conditioning with echo ca.

2764
02:36:07.890 --> 02:36:12.810
Real flimsy.
Granite shock collar.
Real quick
punishment.

2765
02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:16.860
No Man.
Anyway,
good news is Jocko has supplements.
Finally,

2766
02:36:17.970 --> 02:36:20.980
when I say finally not like yes,
finally,
like,

2767
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:24.410
cause the whole world is was waiting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like for decades.
Kind of.

2768
02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:26.910
Can I jump in one quick second before that?

2769
02:36:26.911 --> 02:36:30.460
Of course we are launching a a trackos dog supplement line,
uh,

2770
02:36:30.510 --> 02:36:31.850
when the next couple of weeks ago.

2771
02:36:31.851 --> 02:36:34.910
Speaking of supplements go on trek dot on there for dogs.

2772
02:36:34.911 --> 02:36:39.060
I'm not stepping on your toes,
but yeah.
So you know,
check,
check,
check in.

2773
02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:43.150
<v 3>Stepping on my toes at all.
In fact,
I expect a package of my house for my dog.</v>

2774
02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:45.880
<v 1>Hey Man,
get y'all hooked up to,</v>

2775
02:36:45.890 --> 02:36:48.630
it's got a button and you just got your advertisement in there.
Yeah.

2776
02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:50.800
You're going to pay for that.
What kind of supplements they'll like,

2777
02:36:50.801 --> 02:36:54.370
what does it supplement?
Just native.
Yeah.
Starting out.

2778
02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:56.960
It's going to be a different oils.
Um,

2779
02:36:57.010 --> 02:37:00.190
and then we'll get into college and later this year and stuff like that.

2780
02:37:00.191 --> 02:37:01.720
It's all cognitive driven,
you know,

2781
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:06.830
CBD and a different essential oil stuff and joint supplements and stuff like

2782
02:37:07.121 --> 02:37:09.820
that.
So it's kind of a kind of a mix of a few different things.

2783
02:37:09.821 --> 02:37:12.760
But most of it is,
is for joint pain,

2784
02:37:12.761 --> 02:37:16.310
for overall health cognitive function things like,
yeah.
And it all stems

2785
02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:18.080
<v 4>from the warrior dog,
uh,</v>

2786
02:37:18.081 --> 02:37:21.380
research that we've done in terms of what works with them in terms of raw foods

2787
02:37:21.381 --> 02:37:24.350
and different joint supplements.
And,
and again,

2788
02:37:24.351 --> 02:37:26.390
the college is a big thing and uh,

2789
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:28.940
just kind of drawn off of all of our experience with that,

2790
02:37:28.941 --> 02:37:33.710
but keep them physically maintained kind of thing.
That's a big component.

2791
02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:35.840
You know,
it's like a bunch of broken warriors,
you know,
they take,

2792
02:37:35.841 --> 02:37:38.650
take a lot of extra,
a lot of extra care and,
and uh,

2793
02:37:39.050 --> 02:37:43.670
an animal husbandry to keep him,
keep him sound echo was using that as a segue.

2794
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:44.720
I could feel it.

2795
02:37:44.721 --> 02:37:49.721
Feel it was same thing cause Jocko supplements juggle Super Krill oil for joints

2796
02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:55.430
and joint warfare obviously also for joints.
Glucosamine,
conjoint,

2797
02:37:55.580 --> 02:37:56.413
curcumin.

2798
02:37:56.900 --> 02:38:01.900
Somebody just asked me about what Jujitsu don't your fingers hurt cause you're

2799
02:38:02.541 --> 02:38:06.770
with the Geek.
Yeah,
it's,
it's the common answer is yeah,

2800
02:38:06.771 --> 02:38:11.250
of course they hurt the joint warfare answer at the Krill oil answers is not too

2801
02:38:11.251 --> 02:38:12.230
bad early.
Yeah,

2802
02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:17.240
your hands will get like sort like muscle soreness but my finger and then again,

2803
02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:22.300
it depends on how much of the g and how much grabbing you do I have a low

2804
02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:26.840
d grabbing game.
Yes.
Awkward thing.

2805
02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:30.500
It's not that I don't grab the Geek because I certainly do,
but if,
oh,

2806
02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:34.790
I grabbed that geek.
But if you are determined,

2807
02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:37.240
you get that look in your face.
Like you want me to let go?
You're gee,

2808
02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:40.280
guess what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna hold on it for the last millisecond.

2809
02:38:40.281 --> 02:38:41.510
And when you pull with all your mind,

2810
02:38:41.511 --> 02:38:45.790
I'm gonna let go of it because I'm doing something else.
But yeah,
there's you,

2811
02:38:45.791 --> 02:38:48.170
you see a meow brothers using their hands,

2812
02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:51.860
they're all jacked up and you've watched their Jujitsu game.
That's why,

2813
02:38:51.980 --> 02:38:54.410
cause they're,
they're just,
they will not let go of that.

2814
02:38:54.411 --> 02:38:56.990
G they'll get weird positions and it's,
it's going to hurt.

2815
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:58.910
I don't even know if joint warfare would help him out.

2816
02:38:59.350 --> 02:39:01.580
I'm going to help out them.
Y'all broke at least a little bit,

2817
02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:03.790
but maybe a little bit about your,
you know,

2818
02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:07.490
that's the life he chose kind of thing with [inaudible] and yeah,

2819
02:39:07.491 --> 02:39:11.660
you have a real low grabbing
medium,

2820
02:39:11.730 --> 02:39:15.290
regular g grabbing guy.
Um,
no joint pain,
by the way.

2821
02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:20.180
I'm on Krill oil,
Krill oil during warfare.
I think it's going to help regardless.

2822
02:39:22.330 --> 02:39:26.430
Yeah,
no,
there are certain people,
if you have it like,

2823
02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:30.290
like a surgeons,
we,
we,
we know know people that are surgeons that train Jujitsu.

2824
02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:34.020
You cannot have a high geeky commitment.
Grab,

2825
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:36.590
grabbing commitment.
That's really what I'm talking about.

2826
02:39:36.591 --> 02:39:39.380
I finally figured it out.
I grabbed the g a lot,

2827
02:39:39.710 --> 02:39:44.710
but my commitment on the grabs is relatively low compared to somebody that's all

2828
02:39:44.871 --> 02:39:49.520
about all about that.
Like that's 100% committed to g grabbing.
Yeah,
that's true.

2829
02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.970
To me it's just a setup though.
Like when you're,

2830
02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:54.980
when you're decide you're going to get that,
you're going to break my grip.

2831
02:39:55.820 --> 02:39:58.910
There's since that's my game,
when you go to break my gear rep,

2832
02:39:59.090 --> 02:40:02.210
I know that you're going to break my grip and I have the,
the,

2833
02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:06.470
the chain of events are about to occur.
Yeah.
It's kind of like when you're a kid,

2834
02:40:06.650 --> 02:40:08.870
when you,
when you're playing with your friend or whatever,

2835
02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:11.600
they're like pulling his arm and he's like,
well he's trying to pull it back.

2836
02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:13.520
You're pulling in more and more and then you let go on.

2837
02:40:13.521 --> 02:40:15.090
You trip is lick any falls back.

2838
02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:20.240
Same thing with Jockos g grabbing to set up.
Yeah.
To set up.

2839
02:40:20.370 --> 02:40:20.970
None the less.

2840
02:40:20.970 --> 02:40:25.970
If your fingers are sore from your geeky grabbing commitment levels.

2841
02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:32.550
Super Krill joint warfare.
Mine was the elbows and my back.

2842
02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:38.270
Good.
Good to go.
Now also the subscription is now available.
Oh yeah.

2843
02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:42.990
Yeah.
From what I understand,
coolest cause we have the data,
right?

2844
02:40:42.991 --> 02:40:47.460
Everyone talks about the data.
We have the big data on,

2845
02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:52.680
on Super Krill,
on joint warfare.
And what's cool is when people buy it,

2846
02:40:53.310 --> 02:40:57.180
they buy more,
which is the best indicator I can see because when you try it,

2847
02:40:57.210 --> 02:41:01.920
you feel it,
then you want it.
And so people had requested,

2848
02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:04.440
we put subscription.
So if you want to subscribe,

2849
02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:09.480
just get the Krill delivered to you.
Yeah.
What is that like a monthly?
Yeah.

2850
02:41:09.481 --> 02:41:12.960
You can do both.
You can do every two weeks and you can do with that.

2851
02:41:12.961 --> 02:41:16.260
We can do it with joint warfare.
You can do it with the discipline case.

2852
02:41:16.261 --> 02:41:20.160
You lacking discipline,
you can get it now.
Some people,
that's all they need.

2853
02:41:20.161 --> 02:41:22.920
Just a little discipline and boom,
they're good to go.

2854
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.970
Speaking of which discipline,
what does discipline?

2855
02:41:27.090 --> 02:41:32.090
It's a cognitive physical supplement.

2856
02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:36.940
Yeah.
Pre,
pre workup for me.
Pre mission pre-life.
Oh,

2857
02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:41.190
it's pre mission.
If you have a mission,
you take the discipline,

2858
02:41:41.610 --> 02:41:44.130
it'll help it.
Um,
there's some cognitive stuff in there,

2859
02:41:44.250 --> 02:41:47.200
some little bit of caffeine,
right seat.

2860
02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:49.890
You little bit fired about 15 milligrams.
Yeah.

2861
02:41:49.980 --> 02:41:53.160
Because you go beyond that and I start to feel like how much is one cup of

2862
02:41:53.161 --> 02:41:56.370
coffee and it's like 45 or 50 or a no,

2863
02:41:56.730 --> 02:42:00.900
I want to say a cup of coffee.
Oh yes.
You,
I think you are right.

2864
02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:02.910
I think it's not your standards at 45 or 50.

2865
02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:07.940
So you figure 15 third.
Yup.
Something like that.

2866
02:42:07.950 --> 02:42:11.160
That's what's in white tea by the way.
There's no coincidence there.

2867
02:42:11.220 --> 02:42:13.590
That's a little bit more than I thought.
Not that,
that's a lot.

2868
02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:15.270
It's not a lot at all.
Really like 15,

2869
02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:20.120
15 or as people don't want to do anybody that's a coffee drinker.
Yeah.

2870
02:42:20.690 --> 02:42:22.770
Like drinking a third,
a cup of coffee's not that much.

2871
02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:27.480
They're going to want more for sure.
But it's not nothing.
Yeah.
Something.

2872
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:32.010
It's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's good to me.
That's good.
Um,
nonetheless,

2873
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.970
uh,
you know,

2874
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.680
you take it before you do some something that requires physical and mental
stuff.

2875
02:42:37.681 --> 02:42:39.600
Just like how we were talking about these huge,
it's,

2876
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:41.850
you don't take it before Jujitsu though.
I do take it.

2877
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:46.440
I don't take it before I left.
Right before you work on it.
Yeah,
because I don't,

2878
02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:49.320
yeah,
it's early in the morning.
It's just not about that.

2879
02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:52.470
I think what you're drinking now,
this is white tea.
I had a drink of,

2880
02:42:52.471 --> 02:42:56.610
I had the first drink.
I have watched.
It was the discipline flavored.
It is,

2881
02:42:57.090 --> 02:42:59.690
and it actually tastes good because the chocolate is like that.
Yeah.

2882
02:42:59.710 --> 02:43:04.190
It needs it to taste really delicious.
Taste.
It does taste good.
I,
oh,
he's,

2883
02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:07.500
he's talking about my palate again and,
Oh man,
wait,
wait.

2884
02:43:07.501 --> 02:43:10.410
Who I'm talking about you?
Hello,
Mike.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2885
02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:12.910
Same thing that happened on Jordan Peterson podcast.

2886
02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:16.170
Apparently I have a sensitive Fallon,
what'd you say?
Refined.
Refined,

2887
02:43:16.180 --> 02:43:19.960
but not refined.
So yes.
Discipline tastes good.

2888
02:43:20.350 --> 02:43:22.840
Legitimately tastes good.
You know what you can do,

2889
02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:25.780
and I don't recommend this at night.
Well,
it's a little risky.

2890
02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:29.590
It tastes good enough to have for dessert.
It's got a little sweetness to it,

2891
02:43:29.591 --> 02:43:32.260
right?
It's got,
if you got a little sweetness you can take,

2892
02:43:32.261 --> 02:43:34.090
you can take it for dessert because you think,
oh man,

2893
02:43:34.091 --> 02:43:35.650
I just want to like a little,
oh,
boom.
There you go.

2894
02:43:35.651 --> 02:43:38.440
You have some discipline but you gotta watch out because if,
unless you have,

2895
02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:41.080
I try not to take it if I don't have something to do.
Right.
Yeah.

2896
02:43:41.410 --> 02:43:44.170
And if it's eight o'clock sometimes I eat late at night cause I could eat when I

2897
02:43:44.171 --> 02:43:48.600
get done training,
if I'm,
I don't want to be taken it that late at night.
But why?

2898
02:43:48.650 --> 02:43:50.950
Because the caffeine because the cat,
just the caffeine and there's the whole,

2899
02:43:51.010 --> 02:43:55.920
the whole of micro,
the micro dose of caffeine.
So,
but I have last night I did,

2900
02:43:55.921 --> 02:43:57.970
cause I'm prepping like 14 podcasts right now.

2901
02:43:57.971 --> 02:44:02.310
So I had some discipline late last night so I could dream.

2902
02:44:02.890 --> 02:44:05.830
What do you mean dessert though?
So what do you sprinkling it on?

2903
02:44:05.831 --> 02:44:09.190
A lemon meringue pie or something like that.
Mix Up.
Mix up a shake.

2904
02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:14.020
Oh and you just mentally assign dessert status to it?
It's my dessert now,

2905
02:44:14.650 --> 02:44:17.110
although the other day I,
I ate discipline.

2906
02:44:19.180 --> 02:44:23.450
You were with me.
Yes sir.
And I was saying it's kind of like doing a shot of,

2907
02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:28.230
of of whiskey cause you know,
kind of you do a shot of Whiskey,
you go ha,

2908
02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:32.150
yeah.
It was like a pay style or are you just powder?
Right.
A tower.

2909
02:44:32.370 --> 02:44:35.780
Rudolph power did it ate the powder like the creatine days.

2910
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:40.150
It tastes better than the way.
Yeah.

2911
02:44:40.750 --> 02:44:44.500
So then like the Koolaid just straight up in the day when you make the Koolaid

2912
02:44:44.501 --> 02:44:48.940
and let me just get it the look of made.
What's the,
what's the aw man,

2913
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.520
I figured I was like about to ask you what that is and I figured out mid

2914
02:44:51.521 --> 02:44:53.330
sentence.
Alright.

2915
02:44:55.330 --> 02:44:59.740
If or when you do go to buy these things,
you got to origin mean.com.

2916
02:44:59.890 --> 02:45:04.090
That's where they are super grill joint warfile warfare discipline.

2917
02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:05.980
Get the subscription.

2918
02:45:05.981 --> 02:45:08.770
What I'm saying straight up do that sounds like a good goal.

2919
02:45:09.050 --> 02:45:11.890
I know that the subscription is available.
That's like,

2920
02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:15.910
it's obvious that that's the way to go cause running out isn't good.
No.

2921
02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:18.160
By the way,
like when you ran out of Krill oil,

2922
02:45:18.370 --> 02:45:23.370
that's what I'm kind of mentally drawing upon and he can tell you guys is um,

2923
02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:27.940
very important also at,
or do you mean that.com gs and rash guards.

2924
02:45:27.970 --> 02:45:32.970
If you are about that g grabbing commitment and you're going to put on a g in

2925
02:45:34.331 --> 02:45:37.090
the event of you wanting to put on a geek or needing to put on a g,

2926
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:41.950
you get an origin.
He all made in America also compression gear,

2927
02:45:41.951 --> 02:45:46.570
which is rash guards,
spats approved terminology,

2928
02:45:46.610 --> 02:45:50.770
fruit,
which are what,
what's another word for spats?

2929
02:45:50.771 --> 02:45:55.630
Let's say I'm just tuning in.
Compression pants.
Pants.
Yeah.
Again,

2930
02:45:55.660 --> 02:46:00.520
this is spats got approved because we found out the root meaning.
Yeah.
Um,

2931
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:03.070
nonetheless you get them from origin,
mean.com all made in America.

2932
02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:06.970
It's really cool stuff.
Other stuff on their hoodies and whatnot.
Anyway,

2933
02:46:06.971 --> 02:46:09.010
just go there.
If he like something,

2934
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:12.470
get something good way to support.

2935
02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:16.230
Also if you are into,
and I always say cat,

2936
02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:20.750
mainly the kettlebells.
Okay.
On it.
You know they have cattle but you know on it,

2937
02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:24.860
right.
You know,
the cool kettlebells did premo bells at the whole set.

2938
02:46:24.861 --> 02:46:29.810
By the way I got there,
I got pretty dope.
That's why I got the big,

2939
02:46:29.811 --> 02:46:34.040
big foot one than Jocko thinks he's all actually Jocko was salty that it had a

2940
02:46:34.041 --> 02:46:38.420
bigger kettlebell than him.
Of course he had to go buy more,
but nonetheless,

2941
02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:41.270
I got the whole set kettle bells bigger than your yeah,

2942
02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:45.560
I got the whole set or the Caribbean or two of them together and start slinging

2943
02:46:45.561 --> 02:46:48.320
them.
Yeah,
I'm sure that's what he was doing for awhile and he was like,

2944
02:46:48.321 --> 02:46:51.560
there's go to be a better way to compete with Echo.
Anyway,

2945
02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:56.030
there's other stuff on there as well.
Actually,
I do mention this as well.

2946
02:46:56.130 --> 02:47:00.790
Maces and um,
there's like these little,
like they're called something Dell.

2947
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:03.500
They're like these little flat kind of leather weights.

2948
02:47:03.501 --> 02:47:06.520
Steel bells is what they're called.
Yeah.
Something.
Anyway,

2949
02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:09.810
then you want to vary up your workout,
you know,
deviate from the,

2950
02:47:09.811 --> 02:47:13.520
the mundane boring workout that you might be doing right now.

2951
02:47:13.550 --> 02:47:15.980
Go there and get some cool stuff.
Good way to support.

2952
02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:21.100
Also when you buy the books that Jocko reviews and also Mike's book bikes.

2953
02:47:25.170 --> 02:47:28.790
Got Three Bucks.
Yeah.
Books.
Should I say team dog,

2954
02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:34.860
right?
Yep.
How to train your dog,
the navy seal way also that that came.

2955
02:47:34.861 --> 02:47:37.460
Then you said there's two others that were essentially the same book,

2956
02:47:38.390 --> 02:47:42.620
the same book,
seal team,
dog,
same deal.
Team dog is the same as this young adult.

2957
02:47:42.970 --> 02:47:46.580
Yeah.
Also there's a,
there's training Canon wars and there's navy seal dogs.

2958
02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:49.070
Navy seal dogs is trying to canine words,

2959
02:47:49.071 --> 02:47:51.830
but it's the Gotcha young and old version.
So yeah.

2960
02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:54.980
So when you're going to get that booked and don't worry,
I got you.

2961
02:47:55.010 --> 02:47:57.710
Go to Jocko podcast.com and the book section,

2962
02:47:58.250 --> 02:48:02.150
it'll be by episode would be all these books and all the other books from other

2963
02:48:02.151 --> 02:48:05.840
episodes,

Take you to Amazon.
Boom.

2964

You click buy on Amazon prime.
You get the book that same day.
Sometimes.

2965
02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:14.710
Sometimes
good way to support if you're going to continue to do it.

2966
02:48:14.750 --> 02:48:17.220
Do your other shopping,
you know that lawnmower that you're,

2967
02:48:17.270 --> 02:48:20.420
you're on the fence about to buy.

2968
02:48:20.430 --> 02:48:24.590
Get that to also subscribe to the podcast.

Leave a review if you're in the mood.

2972
02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:41.510
I wouldn't say leave a review if you're not in the mood.
No,
don't.

2973
02:48:42.410 --> 02:48:46.220
I've heard people say that like leave a review.
Oh,
no matter what.
No.

2974
02:48:46.330 --> 02:48:48.200
Well actually,
you know what,
I'm,
that's not true.

2975
02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.280
It's fascinating your life and a good sense of humor to leave a funny review.

2976
02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:55.920
That's cool.
Do it.
Yeah.
That's strong encouragement.

2977
02:48:55.921 --> 02:49:00.620
I don't if you don't have the capacity in your life because some people don't

2978
02:49:00.980 --> 02:49:02.720
know it's going to take seven minutes.
Right.

2979
02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:07.070
There's going to be misspellings in there.
You really want to post that?
No,

2980
02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:10.380
just walk away.
Agree.
Livery view.

2981
02:49:11.010 --> 02:49:14.100
Also subscribe to Youtube because we have a youtube channel,
by the way.

2982
02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:18.060
Do you have a youtube channel?
I do actually.
Yep.

I didn't put on there.
So,

2986
02:49:31.021 --> 02:49:32.830
uh,
I couldn't even tell you what it is.
Yeah.

2987
02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:34.830
Just watched a bunch of your videos on that.

2988
02:49:34.831 --> 02:49:38.040
I'm sure if you just put in Mike Ritalin.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And you too.

2989
02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:42.120
Not to be confused with the other one.
What other ones?
There's not another one.

2990
02:49:42.770 --> 02:49:47.580
Here you go.
So gotcha.
Nonetheless,

what do we got?

2992
02:49:48.331 --> 02:49:53.331
The vision video version of this podcast and excerpts and deluxe ex or ups.

2993
02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:57.440
So we're calling them right now.
Okay.
I'm going to work on for that.

2994
02:49:57.970 --> 02:50:01.980
Jackie gave me good pep talk the other day.
Inadvertent,
by the way,

2995
02:50:02.430 --> 02:50:05.380
because you weren't unless he was seeing in inadvertent.

2996
02:50:06.380 --> 02:50:08.850
But that's the thing with this guy.
Subtle like we're,

2997
02:50:08.851 --> 02:50:11.690
he'll give you a pep talk talk and you don't know that it's a peck.

2998
02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:15.460
The pep talk at the time.
What's one that sounds more calculated than ever?
Uh,

2999
02:50:15.630 --> 02:50:20.630
an advert now that I realized that was calculated a smile at the end.

3000
02:50:20.851 --> 02:50:23.010
I'm like leaving the whole,
we drove back from La,

3001
02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:27.630
whatever and I'm leaving it and I'm like,
you have no idea.

3002
02:50:27.631 --> 02:50:30.090
What am I going to write down,
but to do all this stuff,

3003
02:50:30.210 --> 02:50:32.840
I got it all planned out or whatever.
And it's like,
yeah,

3004
02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:35.440
I don't think Jocko realized like that.
That really help.

3005
02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:40.120
You know what we talked about?
Yeah.
He does know nothing.
Middle last,

3006
02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:44.760
share what you talked about
how to just stuff.
I would say this.

3007
02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.940
Wait and see.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

3008
02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:52.440
It has something to do with me being reluctant to post certain videos sometimes

3009
02:50:53.430 --> 02:50:57.810
like gun shy kind of.
Yeah.
In a way.
Letting let the hands go.

3010
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:59.550
Kinda lift the hands.
Yeah.

3011
02:51:00.330 --> 02:51:04.310
Wayne Gretzky quote of you miss 100% of shots you don't take.
There you go.
Yeah.

3012
02:51:04.311 --> 02:51:07.860
That was part of the conversation and on the list,

3013
02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:11.730
what that has to do is with his video,
so we're gonna,

3014
02:51:11.790 --> 02:51:14.160
we're gonna release a little bit more videos,
different types of videos,

3015
02:51:14.161 --> 02:51:18.870
but if you like videos in relationship to this podcast in any capacity,

3016
02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:22.410
just subscribe to the Youtube Channel.
Also chuck was a store,

3017
02:51:22.890 --> 02:51:26.190
if you don't know already,
it's called Jocko store.
[inaudible] DOT com.

3018
02:51:27.210 --> 02:51:30.420
This is where you can get chocolate pod,
cast shirts,

3019
02:51:30.421 --> 02:51:33.890
discipline equals freedom shirts,
victory MMA shirts,

3020
02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:38.430
the one that Jocko where's every single day
and uh,
you know,

3021
02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:41.940
some rash guards on there,
some hoodies on there.
Um,
you know,

3022
02:51:41.941 --> 02:51:43.140
any kind of gear Jocko,

3023
02:51:43.170 --> 02:51:48.170
Jocko gear really is what it is a very good way to support also psychological

3024
02:51:51.031 --> 02:51:54.000
warfare.
If you didn't know what that is.
If you're on the path,

3025
02:51:54.330 --> 02:51:58.500
we call it the path.
A campaign against weaknesses.
What we've all,

3026
02:51:58.501 --> 02:52:03.480
we also called it
and you hit those moments of weakness.

3027
02:52:03.481 --> 02:52:06.130
Like you know,
you,
you want to hit the snooze so to speak,

3028
02:52:06.460 --> 02:52:09.620
literally and figuratively.
You want to hit the snooze.
Right.

3029
02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:14.320
What does hitting the snooze in life?
Just like I can't do it right now.

3030
02:52:14.321 --> 02:52:18.340
I'll do it later in life.
Yeah.
Like news button should say,

3031
02:52:19.150 --> 02:52:22.300
hit this button and destroy all of your hopes and dreams.

3032
02:52:23.860 --> 02:52:26.350
As far as the fun,
I dig it.
It should say that,
but he,

3033
02:52:26.351 --> 02:52:28.570
the hitting the what that's like,
what?
Like,

3034
02:52:28.780 --> 02:52:33.190
I don't feel like doing it right now.
I'll do it in 10 minutes.
Right.

3035
02:52:33.310 --> 02:52:37.630
Can I give you a product?
A recommendation,
a new Jocko product.

3036
02:52:37.930 --> 02:52:42.490
What are you got developed on us?
It's a,
it's a snooze button.
Shock collar.

3037
02:52:43.650 --> 02:52:48.310
Just shock like it.
Yeah.
Actually you can just,

3038
02:52:48.311 --> 02:52:50.650
you know what else you can do is you can hit the snooze button,

3039
02:52:51.070 --> 02:52:54.430
you can sleep in and then you can wake up 20 minutes,

3040
02:52:54.431 --> 02:52:58.930
half an hour later with that part of your life gone forever with your,

3041
02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:03.190
with your schedule now being off with the opportunity to improve yourself

3042
02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:06.310
physically and mentally gone,
gone can never get it back.

3043
02:53:06.490 --> 02:53:07.410
You can take that feeling,

3044
02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:10.120
you can embrace it and then you can just go ahead and next time you see that

3045
02:53:10.121 --> 02:53:13.000
snooze button you can get pissed off and get up and get out of bed and get after

3046
02:53:13.001 --> 02:53:14.710
it.
Deal.
And you know what,

3047
02:53:15.010 --> 02:53:18.790
in a more maybe echo way of thinking about it to the,

3048
02:53:19.810 --> 02:53:22.570
you don't even benefit from the five minutes.
No other way.

3049
02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:30.640
I,
it makes you more tired.
Yeah.
Cause it's not like you're like,
Dang,

3050
02:53:30.641 --> 02:53:34.300
I need the nine minutes of sleep or whatever.
You know?
And then you're like,

3051
02:53:34.301 --> 02:53:36.520
you get up.
You're like,
Dang,
that nine minutes really helped me.

3052
02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:40.110
It's not like that didn't work.
Like you said,
your worst factually.

3053
02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:43.660
So don't hit the snooze button in the event of you needing help,

3054
02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:45.010
not hating this news.

3055
02:53:45.011 --> 02:53:48.610
He's listened to psychological warfare and this goes for any other little
moment,

3056
02:53:48.611 --> 02:53:53.200
a weakness.
Like if you're gonna skip the workout for the day,
we know those.
Yeah.

3057
02:53:55.650 --> 02:53:59.520
Yeah.
Wait,
we do.
It's part of life I think.
Nonetheless.
I just got,

3058
02:53:59.540 --> 02:54:02.680
I just got my first like mad look for METCO.
I think armor.
No,
no.

3059
02:54:02.681 --> 02:54:04.710
You got some before really.
Well,
not a,

3060
02:54:04.730 --> 02:54:07.850
not on the Jujitsu match because you've looked at me real mad on the GC.

3061
02:54:09.700 --> 02:54:13.660
Genuine,
inc anger,
by the way.
Nonetheless,
he listened to psychological warfare.

3062
02:54:13.661 --> 02:54:15.100
It's an album with tracks.

3063
02:54:15.101 --> 02:54:19.480
Jocko tracks Jocko telling you why you shouldn't hit this news.

3064
02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:23.990
Skip the workout,
eat donuts,
sugar coated,

3065
02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:29.830
why you shouldn't procrastinate,
which is a big deal.
It's huge deal.
Actually.

3066
02:54:29.831 --> 02:54:32.710
Procrastination I think is worse than hitting the snooze.
Well,

3067
02:54:32.711 --> 02:54:35.080
it's the same thing.
It is the same thing that is,

3068
02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:40.800
it's a physical and psychological manifestation of procrastination.

3069
02:54:41.410 --> 02:54:45.580
Without question.
You could also say procrastinate.

3070
02:54:45.581 --> 02:54:48.820
Now go touch this button.
Actually,
in a way it's even worse.

3071
02:54:48.821 --> 02:54:52.330
Actually straight up it's even worse because the snooze button at least has like

3072
02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:55.230
10 minutes later the alarms coming back on.
See what I'm saying?

3073
02:54:55.390 --> 02:54:58.420
Procrastination is an indefinite snooze button and maybe you should call it the

3074
02:54:58.421 --> 02:55:02.080
procrastination button.
Yeah,
that's what it's called.

3075
02:55:02.290 --> 02:55:04.010
That's what it'd be called on the Jocko alarm

3076
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:08.410
<v 0>clock.
Yeah.
Boom.
There it is,
but that's what it is.
Like logic worth or for a day,</v>

3077
02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:09.200
hey look,

3078
02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:13.760
when Jocko tells you in in his terms why you should or shouldn't do things,

3079
02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:17.180
it makes sense.
When you just said the Jocko alarm clock,
the re,

3080
02:55:17.210 --> 02:55:20.660
one of the reasons why we actually made this was because people kept saying,
oh,

3081
02:55:20.661 --> 02:55:23.480
you should make her alarm clock.
Did you make an alarm clock?
Well with this,

3082
02:55:23.481 --> 02:55:25.160
with a,
with a psychological warfare album,

3083
02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:30.340
you can take those tracks from the album and you can put them as your alarm

3084
02:55:30.561 --> 02:55:34.610
clock if you choose to do that.
The big warning is if you're married,

3085
02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:39.020
you don't really want to do this too loudly because you're wonderful.
Freak out.

3086
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:42.620
A couple other things.
You can get Jocko white tea,

3087
02:55:42.621 --> 02:55:45.380
you can get it on Amazon and if you,

3088
02:55:45.890 --> 02:55:50.240
if you're looking to be able to deadlift 8,000 pounds as a minimum,

3089
02:55:50.390 --> 02:55:52.520
we have people going above that.
Now if you get Jocko white tea,

3090
02:55:52.521 --> 02:55:55.640
it's a guarantee that you'll be able to deadlift 8,000 pounds that's in there

3091
02:55:55.641 --> 02:55:58.050
right on the package yesterday.
Yeah,

3092
02:55:58.230 --> 02:56:02.300
I mean it's already been approved by the FDA and the CIA and the FBI.
Double,

3093
02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:05.750
triple blind people.
Uh,
soccer,
white tea.

3094
02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:10.880
You know what straight up tastes awesome.
Makes you feel good.
Books again,

3095
02:56:11.270 --> 02:56:14.840
Mike's book tried it.
Canine Warriors,
navy seal dogs,
team,
dog.

3096
02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:20.810
Those are all available.
Uh,
and also some books.

3097
02:56:20.811 --> 02:56:25.100
I got some books for instance.
What if you wanted your kid to work out,

3098
02:56:26.150 --> 02:56:30.440
study,
eat good food,
train Jujitsu,
and be highly disciplined?
What would you,

3099
02:56:30.441 --> 02:56:33.520
would you want that for your kid and the answers in there?
Invariably,

3100
02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:36.710
yes you would.
So I wrote a book called the way of the warrior kid.

3101
02:56:36.770 --> 02:56:41.320
So your kid will start getting in the game,
overcoming fears to and flares.

3102
02:56:41.330 --> 02:56:44.480
Forgot about that one.
Overcoming fears,
not being picked on,

3103
02:56:45.020 --> 02:56:48.890
making a plan,
following through.
Also,

3104
02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:52.880
I just had,
well soon to come out another book.

3105
02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:55.850
It's called the way of the warrior kid too.
It's called Mark's mission.

3106
02:56:56.900 --> 02:56:57.920
Now we go a little bit further.

3107
02:56:57.921 --> 02:57:00.830
What if you wanted your kid to take control of their emotions,

3108
02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:07.160
wanted them to learn and understand the value of money and how to earn money and

3109
02:57:07.161 --> 02:57:11.270
how to save money.
Wanted your kid to learn about helping other people,

3110
02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:14.960
wanted your kid to become a leader,
but if you wanted those things for your kids,

3111
02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:18.230
well guess what way the warrior kid to Mark's mission.

3112
02:57:18.590 --> 02:57:23.060
It's available right now for preorder on Amazon.

3113
02:57:23.870 --> 02:57:26.630
So check that out.
Speaking of warrior kids also,

3114
02:57:26.631 --> 02:57:28.820
there's a 12 year old warrior kid named Aiden

3115
02:57:30.350 --> 02:57:31.640
and he has a business,

3116
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:36.140
he's a businessman at age 12 he's making soap from goat's milk on his farm.

3117
02:57:36.350 --> 02:57:40.730
He wanted to make good soap.
He said,
can I make Jocko soap?
And I said,
do it

3118
02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:48.100
Irish oaks ranch.com get some soap from Aden the warrior kid.

3119
02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:55.720
And I think I inadvertently made up the slogan for his soap.

3120
02:57:58.940 --> 02:58:03.780
It's a simple,
it's a simple,
it's here,
but there's layers.
It's real easy.

3121
02:58:04.410 --> 02:58:09.300
Stay clean.
I've said that to I,
you know,
I always said that that's a,

3122
02:58:09.301 --> 02:58:11.880
it's an old Motorhead song or it's part of it.

3123
02:58:11.881 --> 02:58:13.470
So it's the lyrics of a Motorhead song.

3124
02:58:14.160 --> 02:58:17.760
And in WWE I used to tell whenever somebody tells me all,
you know,
I,

3125
02:58:17.780 --> 02:58:20.430
I've been drink,
I was drinking,
I haven't drank for six months or I haven't,

3126
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.941
you know,

3127
02:58:20.941 --> 02:58:23.580
I was doing coke and I haven't been doing coke for a first eight months.

3128
02:58:23.581 --> 02:58:27.810
I appreciated,
or I was a drug addict or whatever.
And this is all like online.

3129
02:58:27.810 --> 02:58:31.320
These people saying this stuff online and I always say,
hey man,
keep it up.

3130
02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:35.670
Stay clean.
Now.
I wasn't thinking about the literally staying clean,

3131
02:58:35.970 --> 02:58:39.900
but now we have a proper soap that will help you stay clean.

3132
02:58:40.920 --> 02:58:44.970
Hasn't been a 12 year old kid with a business.
That's pretty impressive.

3133
02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:46.560
It's pretty late.
That's legit.

3134
02:58:46.610 --> 02:58:49.620
I was like the furthest thing from my mind at 12 do you think about what you

3135
02:58:49.660 --> 02:58:53.910
doing here with your cloth?
I would.
I would with my friend Jeff.

3136
02:58:54.450 --> 02:58:59.100
I would,
when people were going to put their trays away in lunch,

3137
02:58:59.310 --> 02:59:03.960
we would collect their leftover potato chips and then eat them all.

3138
02:59:05.400 --> 02:59:05.850
I don't know.

3139
02:59:05.850 --> 02:59:10.850
You're going to say he was like put them in bags so we have a pile of potato

3140
02:59:11.971 --> 02:59:13.980
chips on our tray and we'd just

3141
02:59:16.460 --> 02:59:20.640
a different was I think in about running a business was I think about trying to

3142
02:59:21.210 --> 02:59:25.200
build a business.
No,
I was eating massive amounts of potato chips,
which is just,

3143
02:59:25.620 --> 02:59:28.560
other shoes were where I was at.
Other view that I didn't even pay for.

3144
02:59:29.070 --> 02:59:30.840
I thought it was so awesome.
Free potato chips,

3145
02:59:31.080 --> 02:59:32.250
because remember when you're a kid,

3146
02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:35.880
your parents weren't getting you potato chips all the time have definitely a

3147
02:59:35.930 --> 02:59:38.280
mound of potatoes was more,
almost more than you could eat.

3148
02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:42.960
But we did our best to eat in the morning.
Yeah,
so that's it.

3149
02:59:43.440 --> 02:59:47.010
That's a warrior kid books also discipline equals freedom field manual.

3150
02:59:48.120 --> 02:59:52.980
Get it for people that you actually care about and want to have better lives.

3151
02:59:53.040 --> 02:59:56.280
That's people that you want to win in their lives.

3152
02:59:57.540 --> 02:59:58.860
The discipline equals freedom manual.

3153
02:59:58.890 --> 03:00:03.060
We'll give them a very good indication and the reason I know that is,
well,

3154
03:00:03.690 --> 03:00:06.630
let's not even take my experiences from my life,

3155
03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:10.590
but the feedback I'm getting right now,
people are getting after it.

3156
03:00:10.890 --> 03:00:14.010
They're losing weight or gaining weight or,

3157
03:00:14.310 --> 03:00:17.040
or getting more disciplined in their school,

3158
03:00:17.041 --> 03:00:20.010
in their life and the business because they're getting better straight out.

3159
03:00:20.550 --> 03:00:23.730
So you can get that and it will show you how.
Why?
Because it's a field manual.

3160
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:28.410
You don't know what that is.
Echo,
I do my favorite kind of manual.
Okay.

3161
03:00:29.310 --> 03:00:31.710
A field manual actually gives you instructions in the military.

3162
03:00:31.711 --> 03:00:35.340
You weren't in the military.
You want to know nothing about a field manual.
Hey,

3163
03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:40.040
if you want the audio version of that,
it is not on all level.

3164
03:00:40.230 --> 03:00:44.640
It's not on audible.
You can't get it there.
It's on Itunes,
it's on Amazon music,

3165
03:00:44.670 --> 03:00:47.100
it's on Google play.
Other MP3 platforms.

3166
03:00:47.101 --> 03:00:50.460
It's an album with track so that you can use that thing for your alarm clock
too.

3167
03:00:50.730 --> 03:00:55.020
You can put it in your mixed tape in your,
what's it called?
What's it called?

3168
03:00:55.290 --> 03:00:59.770
It was clay.
Let me
put it in your playlist now.

3169
03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:02.410
You can just have it in there.
Yeah,
so if you boom,

3170
03:01:02.770 --> 03:01:06.970
pick the ones that you like that hits you the right way.
Also,
extreme ownership,

3171
03:01:06.971 --> 03:01:09.760
combat leadership principles that you can apply to your business and your life.

3172
03:01:09.790 --> 03:01:11.860
Other people are doing it.

3173
03:01:13.450 --> 03:01:16.840
That's why that book is still on the Wall Street Journal bestsellers list.

3174
03:01:17.010 --> 03:01:19.930
It's over two years old.
It's still there rocking.

3175
03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:26.650
And also with that book,
if you don't,

3176
03:01:26.651 --> 03:01:29.290
just get it to yourself for yourself,
get it for your team,

3177
03:01:29.770 --> 03:01:30.940
up and down the chain of command.

3178
03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:34.480
It's gonna make your life easier if you put it up and down the chain of command.

3179
03:01:34.510 --> 03:01:37.240
If everyone in your team is taking ownership,
we have a good team.

3180
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:40.960
If you need some help with leadership at your company,

3181
03:01:40.961 --> 03:01:43.810
I have a leadership and management consulting company.
It's called echelon front.

3182
03:01:43.811 --> 03:01:48.010
We solve problems through leadership and we do it all the time and we do it all

3183
03:01:48.011 --> 03:01:52.720
over the world.
Me,
Leif,
Babin,
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,

3184
03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:58.380
email info@echelonfrontdotcomoryoucangotoourwebsiteechelonfront.com.

3185
03:01:59.321 --> 03:02:03.040
Of course we have the muster I through.
I'm going to throw this out there.

3186
03:02:03.070 --> 03:02:06.430
The ultimate leadership conference.
That's what I'm calling it.

3187
03:02:06.460 --> 03:02:09.810
The ultimate leadership conference and really conference.

3188
03:02:09.811 --> 03:02:12.490
It might not even be the right word.
It's just,

3189
03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:16.240
it's embedded knowledge that's going to come at you.

3190
03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:19.390
It's an experience gathering.
It's a gathering.

3191
03:02:20.530 --> 03:02:22.960
There's no green room.
I haven't said that lately.

3192
03:02:23.260 --> 03:02:27.130
There's no green room at the muster.
That is a good point.
There is no bad.
I know.

3193
03:02:27.131 --> 03:02:30.760
That's why I've reminded myself cause I was thinking about it.
Okay.

3194
03:02:30.761 --> 03:02:32.830
Well why would people want to come to this?
Well,

3195
03:02:32.850 --> 03:02:35.710
one reason is there's no green room.
There's no backstage.
We're out there.

3196
03:02:35.740 --> 03:02:39.430
We're with you.
You come to the monster.
We're hanging out,
we're having lunch,

3197
03:02:39.670 --> 03:02:41.950
we're having dinner,
we're asking,
answering questions.

3198
03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:46.120
We're with you there the whole time we've done four so far they've all sold out.

3199
03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:49.180
We're only doing two this year.
A lot of people are objecting to this.

3200
03:02:49.780 --> 03:02:51.100
We don't have time to do more.

3201
03:02:51.610 --> 03:02:54.850
We're only doing two Washington DC,

3202
03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:59.050
May 17th and 18th and San Francisco October 17th 18th that's it.

3203
03:02:59.740 --> 03:03:03.550
We are not a rock and roll band on tour.

3204
03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:05.640
As much as I want to be sure.

3205
03:03:06.010 --> 03:03:08.740
Cause people are saying well why don't you come to Seattle and why don't you

3206
03:03:08.741 --> 03:03:13.390
come to Milwaukee and why don't you come to Norfolk and why don't you come to

3207
03:03:13.391 --> 03:03:17.260
Memphis?
Like we're on a rock tour.
Like we're just making dates.
No,

3208
03:03:17.740 --> 03:03:22.740
this is a the only two we're doing Washington DC May 17th and 18th and October

3209
03:03:23.890 --> 03:03:28.870
17th and 18th in San Francisco was the dates we can fit the muster in to our

3210
03:03:28.871 --> 03:03:31.960
schedule.
And like I said,
they're going to sell out.

3211
03:03:31.961 --> 03:03:35.950
