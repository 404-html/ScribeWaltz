00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.360
Recently at my job we got a new supervisor,

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.080
one who happens to be retired army.
After 20 years.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.060
He and I had a pretty heavy running two which resulted in getting HR involved.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.720
The end result was that I would not be written up for what he claimed I was

5
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.190
doing.
He tried to make an example out of me almost as soon as he got here.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.230
Assuming I was easy,

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.990
he assumed I was an easy target anyways to the point even though he and I had a

8
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:28.734
falling out,

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.830
I'd still like to see the guy succeed at his job and become a great leader.

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.380
After listening to your podcast over the last month,

11
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.670
I'm making an effort to improve our relationship at this job instead of just

12
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:43.410
avoiding the men I've re.
I've recently purchased your book extreme ownership.

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.390
How would you suggest are present this book to my new supervisor and read or to

14
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:52.800
read without feeling as if I'm belittling him as to say he needs work on his

15
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.010
leadership.
I think he could benefit from it greatly.

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.200
<v 1>Good question.
Yeah,
it's actually a question I've answered on here before.</v>

17
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.790
Answer it again because I even learned when I repeat.
Sure.

18
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.670
This is my latest version of what I tell people when they're in the situation.

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.970
Yeah.

20
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.110
Updated version because you get better at things and you figure out better ways

21
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:18.670
to overcome challenges,

22
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.370
especially when you're presented with the same challenge over and over again,

23
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:26.020
which I kind of am.
Yeah man.
Some challenges like this one,
so here's what,

24
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.450
here's what you do.
You give it to him and you say,
you know,

25
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.040
hey boss or hey person,
hey,

26
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:39.041
I got this book and I'm trying to really emulate the principles that are in this

27
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:45.160
book.
It,
it really hit me and I,
I was wondering if I could ask you a favor,

28
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:46.420
if you could just look through this book,

29
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:51.421
kind of see what the principles are and then if you see me falling out,

30
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:54.250
align with the principles of that are in this book,

31
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.220
let me know so I can fix them.

32
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.370
Basic things like if I'm not taking ownership of problems,
if I'm,

33
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.770
if I'm not keeping things simple,

34
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
if I'm not supporting other people around me covering and moving for them,

35
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.910
just let me know.
That's all I'm asking because I'm,

36
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.840
I'm really trying to do a better job.
Could you do that for me?

37
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.740
So then the person says,
well,
yeah,
okay,
fine.
You know,

38
00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:16.960
and then they read the book and when they read the book,

39
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.760
sure there's a chance that they'll be thinking like,
oh,

40
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.920
this book is about everyone else and it's not about me.
Right,
right.

41
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.030
That's possible.
There is also a chance,

42
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.070
a higher chance that they read the book and go,
Ooh,

43
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.880
I make a lot of excuses and I blame other people all the time.

44
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.840
I'm probably not doing a great job as a leader and that might be subconscious.

45
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.170
I see that sometimes now where people are subconsciously making adjustments

46
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.820
because they don't want to admit that they're the person that's,
that,

47
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.170
that the problem,
they don't want to admit that there are the problems.

48
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.850
So they make these little adjustments kind of subconsciously.

49
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.740
And other people will tell me that the boss is like changing.
Oh yeah,
they're,

50
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.260
they're changing their game.
They won't admit it,

51
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.820
but they are changing their game.
So that's what you hope for is that they do,

52
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:01.780
they go through that transfer,
that transformation from,
you know,

53
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.450
not taking ownership and treating people bad and not trying to build

54
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:08.800
relationships and all that stuff that makes them into a bad leader in to taking

55
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.620
ownership,
building relationships,
covering,
moving,
keeping things simple,

56
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:16.390
all the stuff that makes you a good leader.
That's what the hope is.
Now

57
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.570
there's also a chance that this person's gonna hold a grudge,
right?

58
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.410
We,
we,
we got to deal with that.
And I'll tell you,

59
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.460
I was recently talking to someone that had stepped on the toes of another

60
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.190
business,
another division inside their business,

61
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.070
another sales division.
And you know,

62
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:41.071
salespeople are sort of known for being protective and aggressive,

63
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.670
like protective of their territory.

64
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:45.830
Well this guy kind of stepped into their territory a little bit cause,

65
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.990
cause some bad,
bad vibes.
Giant rift.
And he's like,
you don't want,

66
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.850
what should I do?
You know why I feel like all this animosity now,

67
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.490
and it's one of those times where I just said to myself,
well,

68
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:56.770
what would I actually do if I was in that situation?

69
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.680
How would I try and get this problem solved?
Well,

70
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.460
what I would do is walk up to the person who I stepped into their territory and

71
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:08.240
cause problems and I'd say,
Hey,
hey,
I wanted to tell you I,
I,

72
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.260
I totally was out of line when I stepped into your territory,

73
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:14.260
that that was completely my fault.
And you know,

74
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:18.100
I was just got target fixation,
which is bad.

75
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.090
I didn't talk to you,
which is bad.
I stepped into your world,

76
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:27.091
which is bad and I left a disaster and I,

77
00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:30.310
I'm sorry.
That's that.
All that stuff,
everything that I just said,

78
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.330
all my fault and I want to let you know that I completely recognize it.

79
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.920
And number one,

80
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:40.150
anything I can do to try and redeem that and make it up and make you realize

81
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:44.110
that,
and anything I can do to support and help you move forward,
I don't,

82
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.920
I will not let that happen again.
I just want to let you know that.
So boom,

83
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.230
just step up and be humble,

84
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.880
apologize and say,
Hey,
can you,

85
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.190
what can I do to help you?
What can I do to support you?

86
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.960
That's where I would go with these,
with this question.
And then a sort of a,
uh,

87
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.720
an addition to that question.
It's kind of like,
you know,
when you,

88
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.470
when you give your both the book,
right,
it'd be like,
Hey,
this is what I'm doing.

89
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.530
Is that kind of like when you,
when you get,
you know,
like if somebody has a bad,

90
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.060
bad breath and then you put in gum,
you know,
you eat some gum,
he,
hey,

91
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:22.930
you want some gum?
Yeah.
That's very similar.

92
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.300
You just break out the gum.
You know,
I was like to do this,
you know,

93
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:27.460
just to make sure I was like to have a piece of gum,

94
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:29.890
just to make sure you know a lot of fun.
Oh,
you want one?

95
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.500
You might want to take too.
