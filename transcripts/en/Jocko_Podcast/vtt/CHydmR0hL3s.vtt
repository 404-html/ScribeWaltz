00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.200
I sent out a tweet,
which I normally,
you know,

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.370
don't.
And so I sent it out to me.
Here's the tweet,

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.490
here's the tweet that I actually set up.
It was to the notorious MMA,

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.580
which is Connor.
I said,
stay outside the first three rounds.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.540
Don't overcommit strikes mostly jabs.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.640
Get booed by the crowd,
doesn't matter.
Frustrate,
frustrate,

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.770
can be forced.
Bad shots,

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.120
tire him out in the fourth start stepping up the striking in the fifth,

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.470
let it go and finish him.
Good luck John Cavenaugh at John Gavin.

10
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.730
I tagged his coach because his coach,
well,
okay,

11
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.730
now people are going,
okay,
well why were you rooting for Conor McGregor?

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.140
And some people went a little crazy.
Like why are you when he's a bad sets,

13
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:50.100
a bad example for the sport and all that.
So

14
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.300
actually the reason is because I've communicated with coach Kevin,
uh,

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.890
a decent amount on Twitter and little dms and all that and just,
you know,
he,

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.090
he just has been kind of like a cool guy.

17
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.730
And here he was going into coach his fighter in the biggest fight of,

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.450
of Connor's life.
And you know,

19
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:15.660
just because we've had that little commerce that we've had conversations on

20
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:20.640
Twitter a bunch and I just threw that out there like two hours before.
I mean we,

21
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:24.250
I was watching the first fights when I threw that out there.
I didn't know,

22
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.110
the really funny thing is John Calvin was texted back or he,

23
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.520
he tweeted back copy.
So he actually read it and then responded,

24
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.140
which is pretty crazy.
Um,
so,
so anyways,

25
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:42.141
because I have had a little interaction with coach John Kavanagh,

26
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.620
I felt like,
you know,
hey,

27
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.580
I'll throw this out there also.
You know,
Hans,

28
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.620
Hans is like boys with Connor,
right?
And Hans is my boy.
So I was,

29
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:57.690
you know that that association,
There's association,

30
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.680
you know what I'm going to be like,
Hey,

31
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:03.681
Hans is my boy and he has been for a long time and he's Bros with Connor.

32
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.120
And so I just,
you know,
like again,
so,
so people are,

33
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:13.200
why did you,
why are you voting for this guy?
Win?
So there's that whole thing.

34
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.150
Now th th the other odd thing about this is you have a striker versus grappler.

35
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.620
Who do I root for him,
striker versus grappler crap.

36
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.700
I always root for the grappler and I know that factually and statistically the

37
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:33.690
grappler has the advantage because grappling versus striking,

38
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.030
the grappler wins most of the time.

39
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.360
How can you go the distance with this argument?

40
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:43.680
Sure you can took it all the people that all the times that as Stryker is

41
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.890
actually a good grappler and then they don't use their grappling,

42
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:49.380
but they use their grappling only to defend from being taken down.

43
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:51.600
Chuck Liddell the,
and there's a bunch of,

44
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:55.050
and there's countless guys that you can now name that knocked people out and

45
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.420
we're known for their standup.
But what they really were,

46
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:00.220
their base was that they were a good restaurant,
couldn't be down.
So,

47
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.620
but generally,
striker versus grappler the striker,

48
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.890
and this is what I talk about from a self defense perspective,
right?
If,
uh,

49
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.090
if you're a good striker,
the,
then that means you can run away.
