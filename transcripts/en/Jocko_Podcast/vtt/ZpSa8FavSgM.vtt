00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.980
This is Jocko podcast with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.903
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Good Evening Echo and tonight's podcast is a little bit different but I think it

4
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.070
has some good information in it.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I was asked by two people who have outstanding podcasts of their own to sit down

6
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:29.781
and have a conversation about leadership and specifically leadership inside of

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.400
atrocities and when we recorded it,

8
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.290
I wasn't really expecting it,

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.320
but we decided that we would all release it on our podcast platforms.

10
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.310
So the two people that I recorded this with,

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
our Danieli Bolelli and Daryl Cooper,

12
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.370
unfortunately Echo Charles was not present for this recording

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.030
and Danieli Bolelli.
First of all,
he's a history professor,

14
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.810
he's a martial artist,
he's an author and yes,
he's a podcaster.

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.310
He has two podcasts that are great to listen to.

16
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.470
Their great podcast.

17
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.490
One is called the drunk and towers and the other one is history on fire.

18
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.160
They're great podcasts there,
entertaining podcasts,
they're educational,

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.180
they're like I said,

20
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:29.100
they're super informative and the podcast that you're about to listen to is

21
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.260
based on a couple of other podcasts.

22
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.010
The first one being bye Daniellie from his history on fire podcast number 32

23
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.660
Alpha 32 a for civilians out there and the the podcast is about the sand creek

24
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:51.441
massacre which took place in present day Kiowa County Colorado on November 29th,

25
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.810
1864 where there were about somewhere between 70 and 170 Cheyenne,

26
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:05.490
Arapaho Indians,
mostly women and children

27
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.140
who were slaughtered by a 675 man force of the Colorado us volunteer cavalry,

28
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.830
brutal situation,

29
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.110
horrible situation and like I said,
Danieli.

30
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:29.670
Billy talks about that on his history on fire podcast number 32 alpha.

31
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.910
The other podcast this is related to is from Darryl Cooper's podcast.

32
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.240
His podcast is called the martyrmade podcast and specifically podcast number 10

33
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.190
it's about the my Lai massacre

34
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.820
and that is when about 500 innocent civilians.

35
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.151
Again,

36
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:56.151
mostly women and children were murdered and many also raped and mutilated by US

37
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.180
soldiers in Vietnam.

38
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.430
Daryl Cooper is also an incredible podcast.
Her.

39
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.490
He's a great storyteller and he goes through ridiculous,

40
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:17.470
I would say depths to give all perspectives of a story.
And He,

41
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.930
his podcast martyrmade is fantastic.

42
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:23.230
He doesn't put them out off as often as I wish he would.

43
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.850
But the podcasts are great.

44
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.580
The one on the Palestinian Israeli conflict that he started his first,

45
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.760
I think it's his first six podcasts on martyrmade.
That's what it's about.

46
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.680
And they're fantastic.

47
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.000
And he's a veteran of the u s navy.
He's a wrestler,

48
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.170
he's a Jujitsu player,
and he's really smart,

49
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:46.960
well read person and great to listen to.

50
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.870
And then the last podcast is my own podcast,

51
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.980
Jocko podcast number 31 four hours in me lie,

52
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.930
which is when I did an assessment of a book by that name and talked about that

53
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:03.931
same massacre in Vietnam and in this podcast that you're about to listen to,

54
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.890
the three of us discuss how these atrocities come about and what can be done to

55
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.270
prevent them in the future.
So that's the lay down.

56
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.213
And here it is.

57
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.680
<v 1>Danieli Jocko,
everybody.
I'm here.
Daryl Cooper,
uh,</v>

58
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.410
talking to two of my favorite people.
Um,

59
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.630
we're going to go some dark places today.

60
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:33.460
You've listened to the last two podcasts.

61
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:38.461
It's Daniella and I have put out and maybe about 60% of the podcast that Jocko

62
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:41.530
was put out.
Then,
you know,
we're going to,

63
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.040
we're going to dive into some dark places.
Um,

64
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.340
I want to get it started pretty quick.

65
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:49.210
We've been talking beforehand so let's just jump right into it.
Um,

66
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.520
Daniella and I recently did a series that we uh,

67
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.440
cooperated on where he covered the sand creek massacre in 1864 some US army

68
00:04:56.441 --> 00:05:01.270
soldiers,
uh,
massacred some native Americans in Colorado.
Um,

69
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:03.310
I did the meal Lai massacre,
um,

70
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.200
similar situation 104 years later in the jungles of Vietnam.
Um,

71
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.000
we're fortunate enough to be here with Jocko.
If you don't know who Jocko is a,

72
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.300
I guess we'll go ahead and let you introduce yourself just a little bit.

73
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.370
<v 0>Yeah,
my name is Jocko Willink.</v>

74
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:24.371
Guy Was in the military for 20 years and retired in 2010 and now I written a

75
00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:32.351
couple books and have a podcast called Jocko podcast cause I don't get really

76
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:36.200
creative with the names of things.
So

77
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.430
<v 1>jacos pretty direct about things.
So I,
he's also kind of humbled.</v>

78
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:41.910
Jocko is a navy seal commander in Iraq.

79
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.540
He led taskforce bruiser is that right into a task unit.

80
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:48.350
Bruiser bruiser into the battle of Ramadi.
She,

81
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.720
if you know anything about the war in Iraq,
you know,

82
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:55.770
the battle of Ramadi in the battle of Fallujah are probably the two big fights

83
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:56.910
that get mentioned the most.

84
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.750
Whereas Fallujah was more of an more of a direct assault on the city after,

85
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:04.214
uh,

86
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.260
after the insurgents captured and tortured and mutilated some US contractors and

87
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.910
Bush ordered the Marines to retaliate.

88
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:13.170
The battle of Ramadi was a little bit different.
Uh,

89
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.910
Jack was going to talk a little bit about the environment that they went into,

90
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.700
uh,
going into it.
And so he's got some military experience,

91
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:20.810
not only being on the ground,

92
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:25.811
but of leading men in battle in an environment and insurgent war where you've

93
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.450
got different groups of people,
different sex,

94
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:34.250
the Sunni and the Shia Anorak who are fighting a bloody battle that we're in the

95
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:38.630
middle of,
but who we can engage with on their level.
You know,

96
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.160
these are people who are fighting a very,

97
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:44.180
very dirty and ugly war against one another and against us if they get their

98
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:48.880
hands on us as Americans,
I'm going into a war like that.
You know,

99
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.310
we've got,

100
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.760
we've got a different mentality and we try to avoid behaving in ways that

101
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.940
dishonor us.
And uh,

102
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:57.590
it's something that Jocko takes very seriously and he had to let lead men into

103
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:00.830
combat under those conditions.
So we can talk about that.
It was 2006,

104
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:04.880
April of 2006 when you lead you men into Ramadi to begin with,
is that right?

105
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.750
Yes,
that's what it was.
So shortly before that,

106
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.770
a couple of months before the golden dome of the Alis scarred mosque was blown

107
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:15.530
up by al Qaeda in Iraq.
Zarqawi is people,
uh,

108
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.360
this is an ancient Shia mosque,
one of the most sacred places to,

109
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.530
to Shia Islam?

110
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.680
<v 0>Well,
well,
interestingly,
Ramadi was,
is primarily Sunni.
In fact,</v>

111
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:31.681
it's almost all SUNY and interestingly the majority of the military forces in

112
00:07:33.701 --> 00:07:36.250
Iraq,
especially the army were Shia.

113
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.200
And so you had to kind of diffuse that tension on a pretty regular basis to make

114
00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:43.060
sure that there weren't,
you know,

115
00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:47.020
reprisal killings and the,

116
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:52.021
there was definitely some level of mistrust between the Sunni's that lived there

117
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.320
in the city and the Shia military.
But it's definitely,
it's,

118
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:03.820
it's absolutely,
it was absolutely clear that the,

119
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.470
the Sunni's that lived in Ramadi,
the local Sunni's that lived in Ramadi,

120
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:14.100
much preferred the Shia army soldiers to the insurgents that were there that

121
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:20.080
were being run by al Qaeda in Iraq by Zarqawi and the likes.

122
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.410
And because what they were doing was just savagery and you know,

123
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:29.980
everything that you hear about,
they were skinning people alive.

124
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:34.060
They were beheading whole families.
They were torturing,
raping,
and murdering,

125
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.120
murdering the local populace in to get them to support them as much as they

126
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:44.380
could through pure terror.
And so the local populace,

127
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.360
even though they might not have been,
you know,
they're,

128
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.760
they're basically going with who's their worst enemy at the time.

129
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.120
Their worst enemy at the time was without question al Qaeda in Iraq.

130
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.650
And so the she army that was there to fight al Qaeda in Iraq,

131
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.270
the Sunni's or we're generally in support of what the army was doing there.

132
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.104
So it was,

133
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.050
it was a little bit different than an areas like solder city where the,
the,

134
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.230
she is in solder city,
we're very active.

135
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:18.210
There was an active fight going on against coalition forces.
So yeah,

136
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:20.220
it's uh,
it's definitely a tricky situation

137
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.520
<v 1>when you,</v>

138
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.120
when you roll into a situation like that with American soldiers where both sides

139
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:31.890
are engaged in just a hurricane of atrocities across the country and where the

140
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:32.850
people who are there,

141
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.330
they might be looking to you for safety or I guess that's a question I would

142
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:39.570
have a,
they probably under the circumstances where the people in the city,

143
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:41.520
I mean they probably were looking to you to protect them.

144
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.000
<v 0>Absolutely.
And just before we showed up,
just to,</v>

145
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.420
just to kind of paint this as clear as I can and,

146
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:50.090
and I forget the exact numbers and I apologize for that,

147
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.190
but just before we showed up,

148
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.220
the insurgents murdered,

149
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.420
it was something like seven,
eight,

150
00:09:59.421 --> 00:10:04.421
nine 10 of the leading tribal shakes in the area and the tribal shakes that

151
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:07.730
survived for that left,
they left.

152
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.900
And so that just put the whole,
the whole city,

153
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.340
you know,

154
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:18.340
under such a grip of fear of the insurgents that they just basically surrendered

155
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.920
as much as you can surrender,
which means,
hey,

156
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.680
if you want to come and stay at my house and you want to sit in my backyard and

157
00:10:24.681 --> 00:10:26.090
launch mortars at the coalition forces,

158
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:28.520
we're not going to say anything to you because we're going to,
we want to live,

159
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.520
we don't want to get killed.
And that's what you end up with.

160
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:34.220
You end up with passive support.
And that's what the locals were doing.

161
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.020
They were passively supporting the insurgents only because they didn't want to

162
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:43.760
have their heads cut off.
And so as we,

163
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.730
and this was a brilliant strategy that was spearheaded by the one one AED,

164
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.300
the ready First Brigade of the First Armored Division run by a guy named Colonel

165
00:10:53.301 --> 00:10:56.740
Sean Mcfarlin,
who ended up being a general,
and he's a brilliant guy and,

166
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.860
and a great leader,
but you know,
his eye,
his attitude,

167
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:05.540
which he actually got from HR McMaster,
which he had employed up in California.

168
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.430
And uh,
one,
one 80 had actually gone into Californ,

169
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.780
gotten a turnover and understood what they had done up and Telefonica.
And,

170
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.860
and the strategy was called cs clear hold and build,

171
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.790
which was going to be his enemy,

172
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:19.700
controlled territory's these enemy controlled neighborhoods and stay there.

173
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.360
And so that's what,
that's what the strategy was.

174
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.420
And that was a lot different then the strategy that had been being used up until

175
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:30.920
this point,
not just in Ramadi button.
All of Iraq

176
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.040
<v 1>is that strategy that's,
um,
it almost seems like,
uh,</v>

177
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.260
looking at reading about Ramadi from the outside of somebody who's never been in

178
00:11:38.261 --> 00:11:38.710
combat,

179
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.600
it almost seems like the goal was to go in there and establish your dominance

180
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:44.290
over the city.

181
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.400
Almost to show the people of the city that you don't have to be afraid of these

182
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:52.510
people because they afraid of us and we're gonna,
we have freedom in this city.

183
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:56.620
We can take our Humvees and patrol these streets and they're not going to come

184
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:58.570
out and fight us because they're afraid of us.

185
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:01.690
And so you don't have to fear them.
It almost seems like that was the goal there.

186
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.380
Yeah.
I wouldn't use the word dominance because we weren't trying to dominate the

187
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:09.360
local populace.
We were trying to provide security for the local population.

188
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.730
And obviously that's a big difference because when you start having an attitude

189
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.500
of we're going to dominate the local populace,

190
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.940
that that's just a small step in the wrong direction.
Right?

191
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.880
That's a small step in the wrong direction.
Whereas saying,
Hey,

192
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:25.540
we're here to protect and secure and stabilize the local populace,
that is,

193
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.910
that is what we were doing.
Yeah.

194
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.610
I think it took us maybe a little bit longer than we wish it would have to,
uh,

195
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.110
recognize that before you can do anything counterinsurgency,

196
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.670
you have to provide security to the people from to percent.

197
00:12:38.671 --> 00:12:39.880
You're not leaving them a choice,

198
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:42.490
then they're going to provide that passive support.
Right.

199
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.060
<v 2>And I think that's one of the issues that shows up with the kind of episodes we</v>

200
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:49.570
did.
You know both the story of Sand Creek and story off me lie.

201
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.180
You have a c to a shooting,
which sad than the,

202
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:57.040
some guys begin to look everybody on the quote unquote add their side as

203
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:58.410
belonging to the same field.

204
00:12:58.411 --> 00:13:01.840
The Hawaii because they are all Cheyenne or they are old Vietnamese,

205
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:05.620
they are all,
there's no signs that they are not all in the same boat.

206
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:07.990
Some people are your allies,
some people are your enemies.

207
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:09.700
Some people are exactly what you are saying.

208
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:13.150
Stacking between where I kind of have to cooperate with your enemies,

209
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.960
not because I want to buy because I really have no other choice and you cannot

210
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:18.430
treat all of them the same way.

211
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.660
And so I think the dilemma you are facing these idea of having to figure out,

212
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.760
okay,
there are people that we're here to protect.

213
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.440
Those are not the people we're going after.

214
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.410
There are other people that we need to take care of.

215
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.000
That seems to be one of the scenes.
There was Betty match me scene,

216
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:34.840
you know that nuance,

217
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:38.260
that ability to look at people who may look the same way but they are not the

218
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:41.230
same people to look at them it with different eyes.

219
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.560
That seemed to be really well was me seeing some of the stories,

220
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:49.561
no wheat treated where the guys who did what they did is because to damn is like

221
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.160
an Indiana,
he's an Indian,
Vietnamese,
Vietnamese,
whatever.
It's all the same.

222
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.180
Doesn't really matter.

223
00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:00.630
And I think he's like ow do you see one leads to that point on one side and vice

224
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:03.551
versa.

225
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:07.060
What is the you guys were doing to make sure that it doesn't go to that point

226
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.900
where's your guys would not make that switch to that frame of mind and keep it

227
00:14:11.901 --> 00:14:12.060
there.

228
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.670
[inaudible] Betty clear in terms of differentiating in terms of who they are

229
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:16.504
facing

230
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.310
<v 1>real quick.
Can I just add a supplement to that question?</v>

231
00:14:19.311 --> 00:14:24.290
Cause that's kind of what I wanted to ask as well as,
uh,
how do you,

232
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.260
how do you train your men and lead your men in such a way that they can pull the

233
00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:35.230
trigger when they have to and when civilians get killed on,
you know,

234
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.350
accidentally that that doesn't destroy them emotionally.
Right?

235
00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:43.460
There's gotta be some kind of separation there without having them fully enter

236
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:44.930
over into that mindset that Danielle,

237
00:14:44.931 --> 00:14:49.070
he's talking about where you're just dehumanizing the enemy all together when

238
00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:51.280
you have to lead your men in a situation like that.
Like how,
how do you,

239
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.160
how did you deal with that?

240
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.110
<v 0>Yeah.
Well this is leadership.
This is leadership and this is leadership in war.</v>

241
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.770
And this is,
you know,
this,
this question that you're asking is the,
is the,

242
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.191
you know,

243
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:06.191
one of the largest possible questions you could ask about combat leadership and

244
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.940
you know,
I appreciate that you guys keep referring to me,
but I was,

245
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.180
I had 35 or 40 seals there depending on the time and there was 5,600 soldiers

246
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:22.820
and marines that were there that were discriminating targets every single day

247
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.760
and that had outstanding leadership that we're,

248
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.690
that we're making sure that guys with less training than my guys,

249
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:31.040
guys that were younger than my guys,

250
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.450
guys that had a tougher job than my guys in many cases would still discriminate

251
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:37.010
targets and make sure that they were,

252
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.360
were engaging enemy personnel and not civilians.

253
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.100
Now I'm certainly not saying that civilians didn't get killed because civilians

254
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:48.380
got killed and it's an awful thing.

255
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.230
And one of the things I talk about all the time,

256
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:54.710
if you go to war and you're not comfortable with the fact that you're going to

257
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:57.950
kill innocent some people,
then you probably don't have the will to go to war.

258
00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:02.000
And maybe what you're going to war for isn't,

259
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.300
doesn't meet the threshold of what warrants a war.
And,

260
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.770
and if that's what the conclusion you come to,
that's fine.
You know,

261
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.520
let's hope you come to it before you've,

262
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.910
before you've been on before you're on the ground and,

263
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.060
and blood has been spilled.

264
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.720
But there's so many little things to that.

265
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:23.270
Would,
that would,
that,
you know,
that we'd cover to talk about,
I mean,

266
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:26.540
just even the distinction that I just made between like,
hey,
we're,

267
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:30.290
we're going in there to dominate.
That's a little step.

268
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.240
It's one little step and using that word and then following it up.

269
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.670
And we talked a little bit about this and Daryl,

270
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.760
I was listen to your podcast about the meal.
I'm asking her and I,

271
00:16:39.761 --> 00:16:42.830
and I did one about it as well.
And one of the things that,
that really,

272
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.540
that I talked about in pretty great depth because for me I had,

273
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:52.250
I had incredible correlate correlation between what happened in me life and what

274
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:55.520
I sometimes saw happen overseas.

275
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.310
And that was with the intelligence that you're receiving.

276
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.650
And you could see,
and I pointed it out in my podcast and I,

277
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.210
I don't remember like all the exact verbiage,
but you know,

278
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.590
at the senior levels of intelligence,

279
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.160
the intelligence report was that Pinkville or the area of Pinkville or me lie

280
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.380
whenever you want to call it me lie for that,
that area,
the,

281
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:21.110
the initial intelligence was,
you know,

282
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:26.590
suspected Vietnamese in the or suspected Viet Cong,

283
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.520
uh,
area could be possible,

284
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.590
you know,
Vietcong.

285
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.790
And then it went down one level in the chain of command and the next people that

286
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:41.480
briefed it,
it was,
you know,
just a little bit stronger.
You know,
it was

287
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.880
v,
you know,
Vietcong area,
Vietcong controlled area,

288
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:50.950
and then it went down one more level and it was Viet Cong,
uh,

289
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.670
headquarters area.
And then it got down to,

290
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.790
this is all Vietcong and then they threw in the,
the fact that,
you know,

291
00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.020
the,
the,
the people going to the market,
right?
It's market day,

292
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.970
you know,
that started off as,
hey,
some people will be at the market on this day.

293
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.290
And by the time it got to the guys on the ground it was every one that's good is

294
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:14.190
going to be at the market.

295
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.830
Everyone that's still in the village is going to be bad.

296
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.570
They're going to be VC and well you know what to do with VC.

297
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.420
<v 2>Yeah.
What'd he say is,</v>

298
00:18:23.421 --> 00:18:27.220
he said really interesting in terms of just human communication.
Oh,
in that case,

299
00:18:27.221 --> 00:18:30.280
before you even go about Americans and Vietnamese,

300
00:18:30.281 --> 00:18:34.960
you even discuss who are or lead.
Just the basics of human communication.

301
00:18:34.961 --> 00:18:39.040
Now sometime stark dean one degree off.

302
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.590
Before you know it,
if you keep it long enough,

303
00:18:41.591 --> 00:18:45.550
the one degree off to Q so far off course from the reality they are trying to

304
00:18:45.551 --> 00:18:49.480
describe that the wards switch,
he's kind of like playing telephone.

305
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:49.961
You know when you,

306
00:18:49.961 --> 00:18:53.260
we spare something in the other person's theory doesn't sound that different

307
00:18:53.261 --> 00:18:54.400
from what you just third by.

308
00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:58.210
You just tweak a tiny beat by the time you're down 20 people.

309
00:18:58.211 --> 00:19:02.020
The message as no similarity whatsoever to the regional one.

310
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:07.270
And it seems like that as I think we do,
we told the time in daily life,

311
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.750
but nobody dies as a result of its.
Whereas in that Chi kind of scenario,

312
00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:11.650
people do die.

313
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:16.420
And the consequences are so much more dramatic as a result of that.

314
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.460
<v 0>And what's interesting is,
and Darryl,</v>

315
00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:23.960
you kind of brought up in your podcast and you did as well,
Daniel,

316
00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:27.470
is how does this happen?
How does this happen?

317
00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:32.471
Because if you take a normal human being and you drop them into the middle of

318
00:19:33.321 --> 00:19:36.920
that thing,
they look around and they go,
what the hell's happening?
Which is,

319
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.130
which is actually what happened when,
uh,
when,
uh,

320
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.380
Hugh Thompson came in his helicopter,
he,
he dropped into this situation and said,

321
00:19:45.381 --> 00:19:49.130
what the Hell's going on here?
This is totally wrong.
Uh,

322
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:53.660
but as you're,
as you're getting there,
if you're not on that trip,

323
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.920
if you're not on that train as it's going off the rails,
you,

324
00:19:56.921 --> 00:19:57.890
you don't recognize it.

325
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.490
And that's why one thing I talk about all the time from a leadership perspective

326
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:06.730
is the ability to detach from all the chaos and all the mayhem that's happening.

327
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.480
Because if you don't have to,

328
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.380
if you don't have the ability to detach from that chaos,
you're in it.

329
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.660
And if you're in the chaos as a leader,

330
00:20:14.661 --> 00:20:16.730
you don't see the mayhem that's happening.

331
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.050
And so it's so important for a leader in the business world,

332
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.010
but certainly in the military,
to be able or in any leadership position,

333
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.600
to be able to step back and,

334
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.700
and observe what's actually happening from a detached perspective.

335
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.150
Because otherwise you're in the storm.

336
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.130
And that is not a good place to be as a leader.

337
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.130
<v 2>You've got to have rules for how you're going to behave before while you're</v>

338
00:20:40.131 --> 00:20:41.780
going into it.
Because if you just,
you know,

339
00:20:41.781 --> 00:20:46.520
if you're going to react to everything on the ground once you arrive,
uh,
I mean,

340
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:49.700
it's always expedient to just shoot them.
You know,

341
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.720
at the time it's always easier and safer probably to just do the easy thing and

342
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:59.140
be violent or whatever.
So you have to have rules going into it.
Um,

343
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.480
did you have to guess the one thing that I want,

344
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.730
because the point team bidding stuff is super interesting,

345
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:07.180
but I think essentially what you're saying is that the person in a position of

346
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:10.750
leadership needs to be as an master.
You know,

347
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:15.190
they need to be in the middle of emotions that clearly are affecting everyone

348
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:19.330
around them and they are bombarded day are getting bombarded windows,
emotions.

349
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:22.150
They need to be completely detached from this stuff.

350
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.960
It makes perfect sense.
Do you do it?

351
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.660
Cause it's a hell of a lot easier said than done clearly.

352
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.100
And I would do people even terrain to get to that place

353
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.250
<v 0>so well for one thing,</v>

354
00:21:35.251 --> 00:21:37.650
when I was running the training for the west coast seal teams,

355
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.540
I would fire up that training to a point that it was,

356
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.890
there was total temptation for the leaders to get wrapped into the scenarios

357
00:21:46.891 --> 00:21:48.480
that I was developing for them.

358
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.590
There'd be total mayhem and if they let it happen they would get wrapped up in

359
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:57.540
these horrible scenarios mentally,
emotionally they'd be mad.
They'd be mad at me.

360
00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.100
Cause I was the guy that was running the training.

361
00:21:59.101 --> 00:22:03.180
They'd be mad at the opposing force roleplayers they'd be mad at their guys.

362
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.630
They'd start yelling and screaming.
They'd make bad decisions and,

363
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.660
and I wanted them to get there because I wanted them to see what happens when

364
00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:14.880
you get wrapped up in this stuff emotionally.
So,

365
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.750
and then what I would do is teach them that they have certain,

366
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.460
what I would call red flags,

367
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:25.060
certain certain signals that they need to learn how to pick up.
Yeah.

368
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.780
If you feel yourself start raising your voice,

369
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.280
well then that probably indicates that you might get be getting emotional if

370
00:22:32.281 --> 00:22:34.650
you're breathing heavy,
if your fists are clenched.

371
00:22:34.651 --> 00:22:36.650
There's all these things that you start to recognize.

372
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.680
And once you can recognize them and you say,
okay,

373
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.430
I'm starting to get emotional right now,
need to step back.
Now interestingly,

374
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.530
what I would often do an easy methodology for training these guys was first of

375
00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:53.040
all,
stop looking down the sides of your weapon like you.
You're not allowed to.

376
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.181
And we'd give,

377
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:57.300
we'd give a liter of stick if we had to and take their gun away so that they

378
00:22:57.301 --> 00:22:58.260
weren't going to be shooting.

379
00:22:58.261 --> 00:23:03.261
They weren't going to be wrapped up in that tactical situation and literally put

380
00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:08.910
that weapon at high port and step back away from the firing line.

381
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.620
You know Kelly Kelly is with his m 16 gunning people down.

382
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:18.180
He's completely wrapped up in what's happening.
Medina's yelling and screaming.

383
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.270
I mean I talk about this with,
with police forces as well.

384
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.820
If you want to hear people go,

385
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.220
go listen to some of the bad shootings that you hear and police have a

386
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:33.300
incredibly hard job.
They need way more training.

387
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.160
But go listen to some of those shootings that take place and listen to the pitch

388
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.660
and the tone of the officer if and,
and what are they doing?
They're saying,
God,

389
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.430
I'm good to get out there.

390
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.950
They're completely emotional and that emotion is going to drive bad decision

391
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:52.070
making.
So you have to learn how to detach.

392
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.300
The way you do it is in a way I would initially teach guys to do it is by

393
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.150
physically putting their weapon at high port,

394
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:04.210
stepping back away from the actual firing line and look moving their head around

395
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:09.410
and looking around.
You know,
so Bob Story I wrote about an extreme ownership is,

396
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.230
you know,
we,
I had w w the,
the Delta platoon commander who's a great guy,

397
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.070
smart guy,
you know,
Ivy League naval academy and just,
just a,

398
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.570
a brilliant guy,
great guy.
And he was,

399
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:28.460
we were doing some training and it was in Humvees and we were doing immediate

400
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:30.170
action drills and Humvees here out in the desert.

401
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.350
And your targets pop up and you engage the targets.
It's like,

402
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.990
it's like being mini tank commanders and you've got five vehicles,

403
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.680
you've got to maneuver them on the battlefield while they'd provide cover fire

404
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:41.990
for each other.
And it's,
it's a little bit chaotic.

405
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:43.700
There's big machine guns shooting.
And,

406
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.680
and when I was going with him and I was sitting behind him observing him do
this,

407
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.690
and every time the shooting we started,
he would kind of lock up,
right?

408
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.770
He'd kind of like lock up.

409
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.670
There's so much happening that he wasn't processing it quick enough.

410
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:03.530
And so I took a sharpie magic marker and I,
and I,
and I wrote down,

411
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.340
um,
on the window in front of his face.
I wrote,

412
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.560
here's what I want you to do and when,
when the shooting starts,

413
00:25:09.561 --> 00:25:14.240
I want you to this one,
relax to look around three,

414
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.163
make a call.

415
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.790
And at that time I hadn't thought through this stuff as much as I have now

416
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:21.530
because I've been doing it for much longer.

417
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:26.810
But what I was telling him to do was detached from what's happening and the way

418
00:25:26.811 --> 00:25:30.810
you do that,
as you relax,
you look around and,
and then you get on the,

419
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.110
the radio and you make a call and you know,

420
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.750
the next run I watched him and I was sitting behind him and I'm looking over his

421
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:38.870
shoulder and once the shooting starts,
you can't hear anything.
So I'm just,

422
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.660
just watching him and I,
I see him,

423
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.340
the shooting stars and I seen him look at the window and I seen him take a deep

424
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:44.600
breath and exhale.
And I was like,
okay,

425
00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:47.540
he just relaxed and I see his head to start turn and I realize,
okay,

426
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:49.760
now he's looking around and,
and that,

427
00:25:49.761 --> 00:25:54.560
those two simple items were enough to make him detach from all that chaos,

428
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.130
actually assess what is happening and then make a good decision.

429
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.300
And so that is one of the most important things that you can train a leader to

430
00:26:02.301 --> 00:26:04.340
do.
Sounds like coaching a Jujitsu white belt.

431
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.170
First thing you tell them that on the ground,

432
00:26:06.171 --> 00:26:09.930
getting beat on and they kind of first,
firstly you tell him,
breathe,

433
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.290
just breathe,
relax.
Until you can do that,
then nothing's going to work.
Yeah,

434
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:17.300
it's one of those,
it's one of those things to,

435
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:23.050
people talk about like breathing exercises and one thing that I would

436
00:26:23.841 --> 00:26:24.651
instinctively do,

437
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:29.390
and it's another thing that I would train my guys to do was like you don't panic

438
00:26:29.391 --> 00:26:34.160
on the radio.
You don't yell on the radio,
you don't scream on the radio.
You,

439
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.640
no matter what's going on,
when you get on the radio you say,

440
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.390
you know bruiser one six,
this is bruiser over.
I mean that's,
that's what you do.

441
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:46.650
And in order to do that,
you have to relax you.

442
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.060
So it forces you.
If you're not going to sound panicked on the radio,

443
00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:56.400
which if you sound panicked on the radio and,
and your team,
here's it,
guess what?

444
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:59.310
You're going to have panic going on.
So you have to,
it's another,

445
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.870
it's another method to detach.
So when you hear your voice getting excited,

446
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:04.291
when you know,

447
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:07.500
when you're read about lieutenant Calley yelling and you hear about Medina

448
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:09.810
yelling,
uh,
that,
that,
you know,

449
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.780
Kelly started yelling likely because Medina was yelling at him.

450
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.150
And now that's what happens.
We're just,

451
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.030
we're just sending that panic through the chain of command and it's a,

452
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:19.320
it's a horrible,
horrible thing.

453
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.710
<v 2>I think what's fascinating about it is that the parallels,</v>

454
00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.280
even through the scenario you artists,

455
00:27:24.281 --> 00:27:26.890
could I be [inaudible] seem the 99% of the people,

456
00:27:26.891 --> 00:27:29.920
at least sitting in 99% of the human beings would never have to deal with

457
00:27:29.921 --> 00:27:31.390
because they are never going to be in combat,

458
00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.880
which bullets flying all around them and all of that.

459
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.720
And yet it's easy to forget the deceived dynamics that are at play in most

460
00:27:39.731 --> 00:27:44.410
people lives in ways that they may be able to recognize in the last six stream,

461
00:27:44.411 --> 00:27:45.670
uh,
consequences.

462
00:27:45.671 --> 00:27:49.510
But like when you're a parent and you have your kids going wild,

463
00:27:49.511 --> 00:27:51.900
then suddenly you find yourself,
you know,

464
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.900
raising your voice and starting to yell at them and not the cause.

465
00:27:55.901 --> 00:27:58.720
I mean there's a time and a place sometime is the right thing to do is to kind

466
00:27:58.721 --> 00:28:00.940
of call them on their stuff in harsh ways.

467
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:05.350
But there's a difference between raising your voice with any intent and raising

468
00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:08.770
your voice because you are losing it and you're getting overly emotional and

469
00:28:08.771 --> 00:28:12.890
they're getting angry and Keith's realize it and they way leader you day we have

470
00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.560
see how you are losing your stuff.

471
00:28:14.561 --> 00:28:18.730
They will see how you are less of a credible presence in their life that they

472
00:28:18.731 --> 00:28:23.140
know can count on you that way because you are a rapid in your own emotions and

473
00:28:23.141 --> 00:28:26.720
you know they press a little button and you go off sometime they'll press that

474
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.120
button because they enjoy seeing new golf sometimes.
But you know,

475
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.950
the point is you're not a good leader as a parent.

476
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.520
<v 0>And it's the same thing.
I mean,
my company now,</v>

477
00:28:35.521 --> 00:28:39.150
we work with businesses all over the world and it's the same exact thing.

478
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.100
And I teach the same exact thing.
If you're starting to get mad at your employee,

479
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:45.540
you're starting to get mad at your subordinates.

480
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:47.190
If you're starting to get mad at your boss,

481
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.270
what should you be doing as a good leader?
You should be detaching.

482
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.520
Taking a step back,
I've told people,
hey,
if you start feeling that way,

483
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.640
you stand up from the meeting table.
Just,
just,
you know,
no one's going to say,

484
00:28:56.641 --> 00:29:00.060
Hey,
what are you doing?
You just,
you know,
stand up,
stretch out,
step back away.

485
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.060
These people are having a heated argument and you start getting involved in it

486
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.390
instead of getting involved in it.
Take a step back.
By the way,
when you do that,

487
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:09.270
you look like a tactical genius because everyone else has started losing their

488
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:11.400
temper.
They were starting to say things that they shouldn't say.

489
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.400
And you're the one that's listening.

490
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.770
I just just covered a book.
Um,
and,
and just,

491
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:23.520
just like a little thing is if,
if there's,
if you're talking,

492
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:27.600
I'm gonna let you talk because if I let you talk,
I know twice as much as you,

493
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.580
I know everything that you know and I know everything that I know,

494
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.410
so I'm going to win that tactical situation.
Um,

495
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.050
I want to come back to what you were just saying,

496
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:36.030
Daniella about leadership as a parent.

497
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:40.950
It ties into something he was talking about a few minutes ago with like a police

498
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.130
officer who's panicking.

499
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.460
<v 1>We were mentioning this on the car ride over here about police shootings.</v>

500
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:46.330
Like more often than not,

501
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:49.060
what you see is that they're the result of incompetence.

502
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.950
They're the result of um,
uh,
socially inept cop who can't manage the situation.

503
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.960
And it's not an easy situation to manage.

504
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.210
You've got a potentially dangerous person,

505
00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:02.830
you don't know them and maybe they're lightly resisting you just verbally and

506
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:04.840
you've got to take control of that situation.
Well,

507
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:08.020
unless you're an exceptionally competent and confident person,

508
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.580
it may be the only tool you have to bring that person under control is your

509
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:15.480
baton or whatever it is.
And,
um,

510
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.320
you get the impression in Vietnam,
especially once you get up to 68,

511
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:22.020
69 where you know,

512
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.080
they're starting to just throw junior officers and right out of,
you know,

513
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.740
ROTC and just throwing them into combat and you hear,
uh,
stories about,

514
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.270
you know,
officer's getting fragged.

515
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.140
You start to hear stories about Cali washed out ocs three,
three times,
right?

516
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.450
And you,
uh,

517
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.780
you get these people now into a situation where you have a military unit that

518
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:44.620
recognizes they're incompetent leadership and they're scared.

519
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.960
They feel incompetent themselves as a unit.
Um,

520
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.920
and you get them into a place where,
uh,

521
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.220
and maybe this is something that you can contrast really well because you dealt,

522
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.280
you led primarily,
uh,
seals and marines,
right?
Seals joke.
It just hits you.

523
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:02.570
And you worked a lot with marines,
the marines and army soldiers as well.
Okay.

524
00:31:02.571 --> 00:31:07.540
Yeah.
And mostly there was one battalion of marines in inside Ramadi.

525
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.720
Okay.
The three,
eight marines.
Awesome.
When you're dealing with,
uh,

526
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:16.480
the American military today.
And I know,
I mean,
um,
something that'll,

527
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.490
it gets lost on a lot of people is that,
uh,

528
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.330
as highly trained and motivated and all those things as our special forces are,

529
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.110
you know,
they're very specialized.
You guys are,
you know,
trained for very,

530
00:31:26.111 --> 00:31:28.420
very specific intense missions and stuff.

531
00:31:28.421 --> 00:31:33.340
But you go pull an average ranger or marine or something or infantry men,
uh,

532
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.140
you put them in combat with good leadership and that is a unbelievably effective

533
00:31:38.141 --> 00:31:41.230
soldier.
I mean,
American soldiers today are all volunteer force.

534
00:31:41.231 --> 00:31:44.710
These are incredibly well trained and motivated people if you know,

535
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.680
if they have the proper leadership.
Uh,
when,

536
00:31:47.681 --> 00:31:50.230
when you get back into a situation like that with Vietnam,

537
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:54.190
where you get a whole unit in that situation that,
that cops in,

538
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.050
where they're in maybe a village,

539
00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.310
they don't exactly know how to handle this situation without resorting to lethal

540
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:01.144
force.

541
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.910
And they start to feel threatened and everything runs off the rails.
You know,

542
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:09.940
it's,
it's unrealistic to expect,
just like,
uh,
you know,

543
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.870
you're happily married man,
and you don't want to cheat on your wife.

544
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.420
Then when you're off on a business trip,
uh,

545
00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:20.410
after you've had a few drinks with the coworker that's on travel with you,
um,

546
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.100
it seems innocuous.
Maybe it's totally innocent at the time.

547
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:28.660
Don't go upstairs to the hotel to watch a movie because if you get to that
point,

548
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.730
you're just putting yourself in a terrible position.
Right?
And,
and in an a,

549
00:32:32.731 --> 00:32:34.000
in that military context,

550
00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:39.001
the idea that all of the built up momentum behind something like me lie,

551
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.850
the idea that you're going to get right up to that moment on March 16th,

552
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:48.850
1968 where the only thing that's stopping it from happening is a few pounds a

553
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:51.570
trigger pull.
That's the last bit of,
you know,

554
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.910
that's your last opportunity to avert this catastrophe is just that few pounds a

555
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:58.130
trigger pull.
Good luck with that.
You know,

556
00:32:58.131 --> 00:33:00.650
that's something that you can't let it get to that point.

557
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.010
And that was something that,
uh,
and then I'll let you guys take it over.

558
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:06.980
But I wanted to talk about something that it was fascinating to me that you

559
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:07.611
picked up on.

560
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:10.720
As soon as I said the word establish dominance on the streets or Ramadi,

561
00:33:10.721 --> 00:33:13.970
you reacted against that.
And you're right.
That's incredibly important.

562
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:17.390
And it ties into what you were just talking about,
about you would make people,

563
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.751
uh,

564
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:21.590
either back away from the situation or stop looking down the sites of their gun.

565
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.560
Because when you're looking at a person down the sights of your gun,

566
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.580
it's your framing of the situation and you haven't put down their gun.

567
00:33:28.581 --> 00:33:32.810
And now it's just a person.
It's not a target.
It's not anything like that.
Uh,

568
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:36.590
if you got a bunch of people going into Ramadi and they're thinking in terms of

569
00:33:36.591 --> 00:33:40.460
our job is to go establish dominance on the streets of this city,
well,

570
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:44.270
you're framing that in a way that under the right circumstances could,
uh,

571
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.030
you know,
lead to trouble.
And so framing it seems like it's,

572
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:47.864
is what you're talking about.

573
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.440
<v 0>And,</v>

574
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.440
and I also want to make it perfectly clear that if the soldiers,

575
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:58.490
marines,
seals that we work with in the battle of Ramadi,

576
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.320
if they didn't dominate the street as we move down it,

577
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.330
you know,
we would be just be,
oh,
we be killed.
So there is,

578
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.590
the job is even harder than I made it out to say to be because I don't,

579
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.920
I w I wouldn't want to use the word dominate the city of Ramadi,

580
00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:17.120
but you're damn right,

581
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:20.840
we're going to dominate the space that we go into and we're going to do that by

582
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:25.490
being very,
very aggressive.
And so there is this fine line,

583
00:34:25.491 --> 00:34:29.780
and by the way,
you'd go into a,
you'd kick a kick a door in,
in Ramadi,

584
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.190
and there's,
there's gunfire in the street that you're on.

585
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:39.050
You'd kick in a door and there would be a mom and a dad and a couple of kids and

586
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.110
there'd be a normal household with green grass and a soccer balls.

587
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.950
And that would happen that that's what the city was filled with.

588
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:50.310
And so the,
the fact that these guys,
you know,

589
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.980
were able to flip that switch over and over and over again was,

590
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.380
was amazing.
And it's a,
it's a testament to,

591
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.830
to the military forces that we have and to the leadership.

592
00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.900
I want to give equal credit to both.
But to your point about,

593
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.660
hey,
you know me lie,
these were draftees.

594
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.840
There was hundreds of thousands of draftees that went over there and did an

595
00:35:14.451 --> 00:35:18.020
incredible job.
They were well led,
that stood up when people win,

596
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:19.820
when the wrong things were happening.

597
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.680
So this was a horrible scenario.
Okay,

598
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.580
<v 1>Daniella,
let's follow up on that then.
I mean,
that's,</v>

599
00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:29.160
cause that's what's the difference?
Like what happens,
um,

600
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.530
you didn't get all the psychopaths in the army and round them up into one unit,

601
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.950
right?
Um,
by all accounts,
the guys at me lie,
uh,

602
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.490
<v 2>talked to you.</v>

603
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:43.110
They were the type of people that when the folks back in Kansas heard about what

604
00:35:43.111 --> 00:35:43.471
happened,

605
00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:46.360
they couldn't believe that little Johnny would ever do anything like that.

606
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.100
Same thing at Sand Creek.
Right.
Same thing.
And so

607
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.840
because you're right,
we were talking about this on the way to something today.

608
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.800
It is a for,
we have something like Abu Ghraib happens.

609
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.890
It's a terrible situation.
A lot of bad things went on there.

610
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.400
The idea though that an entire company of American soldiers would go into an

611
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:13.131
Iraqi village and wipe out 500 innocent people that is inconceivable today,

612
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:18.240
uh,
in,
in the sense that so many things would have to go wrong and break down and

613
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:23.220
degrade and degenerate in the American military for that to have happened that

614
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.990
it's just,
it seems like a completely different moral universe.
And

615
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.460
you look at what the chain of events that led to me lie.

616
00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.880
It was those and if any of those chain of events,

617
00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.780
any anywhere along that chain of events could have broken that whole chain.

618
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:43.650
Lieutenant Calley could've gotten killed when the field and now you could add

619
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:48.210
someone else came in that was a better leader and didn't have a Napoleon complex

620
00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:51.040
and was able to stand up more lead to other people.
There's,

621
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.410
there's so many things that could have changed on that,
you know,

622
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.020
that could have changed that whole scenario.
The most,

623
00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.380
the most powerful one being a different leaders.
Same thing at Sand Creek,

624
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.030
different leader that that actually never would have happened.
Right?

625
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.380
I'm never would have happened.
And you see that,
you know,

626
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:11.430
you see all the guys on their side lost soul like you 90 Mosley,

627
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:14.510
they all agree with team where I was all the guys we achieving United,

628
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.510
it's like clearly there's a leadership element where the average guy in those

629
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:23.511
units is heavily influenced by WHO's setting an example for them.

630
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.390
And that sees one of the scenes that interests me about human nature that,

631
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:27.901
you know,

632
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:31.200
one of the things cause we were discussing like does that mean that human being,

633
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.021
you know one of the things too,

634
00:37:32.021 --> 00:37:35.010
we had our lot with these are human beings just Tivo by nature and he's like,

635
00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:35.850
no they are not evil.

636
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.850
Do Majority of people are now there are of course the exceptions that he's,

637
00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:42.150
that whatever's mold percentage,
but the majority of human beings are not evil.

638
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.720
The problem is that the majority of human being Saturday [inaudible] lien for

639
00:37:46.721 --> 00:37:49.920
once,
like they're more alcohol and plus can arrange him so many do you fit in

640
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:52.470
direction that and they're right.

641
00:37:52.471 --> 00:37:56.430
Leadership Day will be awesome human beings and the wrong leadership,

642
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.810
he's not that hard for them to start sliding down everybody direct direction.

643
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.270
So to me it kind of is a method of weakness more than evil.
No,

644
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:10.170
it's not that these guys are a complete psychopath where you know you haven't

645
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.110
been there with them and they are nice people and they yell to the Old Lady

646
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:17.750
Cross the street and yet the the Getty,
why did,

647
00:38:17.751 --> 00:38:19.320
they may have good intentions,

648
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:23.420
good intentions don't go too far without crazy DC plans,

649
00:38:23.421 --> 00:38:24.620
throng willpower,

650
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:29.690
a lot of the qualities that allow you to keep it as good tension real and

651
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:34.470
they're heavy emotional thresh where he doesn't all fly out the window.

652
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.980
It's like,
I don't know what happened.
I just

653
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.740
<v 1>lost my mind.
Or Hey,
they told me that this was the thing to do.</v>

654
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:40.330
And so I just followed orders.

655
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.070
You know where you have that integrity to stay present in a crazy situation.

656
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:51.250
You're asking human beings to be kind of extraordinary in those circumstances

657
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.070
because the ordinary human being may go down a bad path.

658
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:58.330
So the antidote in some ways seem to be to make yourself extraordinary,

659
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:03.650
to be,
to be able to withstand a kind of situation.
And that's where,

660
00:39:03.651 --> 00:39:03.971
and get a,

661
00:39:03.971 --> 00:39:07.950
to lead or make a huge difference because so many people would be like flags in

662
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.060
the wind.
You know,
if the wind is tilting one way,

663
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.880
they will go with a though knowing the Stilton heavily the other way,

664
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:15.580
they'll also go that route and,
and so that,

665
00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:19.120
what interests me is because while a few humans,

666
00:39:19.121 --> 00:39:21.970
we load always choose a pretty massive dop,
evil side,

667
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.420
a bunch of humans can go either way.

668
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:30.130
What he's that shape the kind of human beings that we'll be able to be a great

669
00:39:30.131 --> 00:39:33.670
leader or even just for themselves,
even if they are dev nobody under them,

670
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:37.840
just they will make choices that in an ideal scenario,

671
00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:42.580
most human beings would want to make.
What does separate the guy who,

672
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.530
you know,
he's sitting there on on the couch saying,
oh,

673
00:39:45.531 --> 00:39:48.550
I would beat a guy and a guy [inaudible] that guy.

674
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.540
I think one of the difficulties with that,
um,

675
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.030
is Jocko,
you and Jordan Peterson talked about this and um,

676
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.640
your podcast together.
Um,

677
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.600
you were talking about the book ordinary men and how uh,
you know,

678
00:40:04.601 --> 00:40:08.020
you've got a couple of guys,
group of guys there who are going to,

679
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.640
who are being ordered to do something that's grotesque and it's not simply a

680
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:14.890
matter of like,
you know,
that's a real good situation.
If,

681
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:19.420
let's say you are a person of strong moral character of just all the things that

682
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:20.380
you would want them to be.

683
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.950
You've got two conflicting moral systems here because you have a duty and

684
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:27.940
obligation to your fellow soldiers who were going to have to go do this one way

685
00:40:27.941 --> 00:40:31.660
or another unless you revolt completely and then you're betraying your country

686
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:33.890
and there's all these other things that are brought into it that,
you know,

687
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.830
that are moral things.
These are,
you know,

688
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.570
it's moral to not want to abandon your friends and your colleagues to have to go

689
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:44.950
do the hard work that has to be done so that you can go nurture yourself,

690
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:46.990
righteous sense of personal morality.

691
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:49.720
Or at least that's the type of thinking that might go through a person's head.

692
00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:49.930
Like,

693
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:54.930
what right do I have to put my own personal idea of what's right ahead of my

694
00:40:55.721 --> 00:41:00.220
obligation as a soldier ahead of what my country is telling me to do ahead of,

695
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.100
uh,
just being in there with all of my friends and fellow soldiers and,

696
00:41:05.101 --> 00:41:07.210
and leaving it to them.
Like that's a moral thing.
And that is a,

697
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:10.840
that is something that you want people to feel.
Right.
And I,
and I,

698
00:41:10.841 --> 00:41:15.820
and I wonder sometimes how much of these situations are filled with people who,

699
00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:19.390
um,
you know,
maybe 90% of them,
the,
the,

700
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.910
the vast majority that aren't those few evil ones,

701
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.400
they're all kind of looking at each other.
Like,

702
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.300
maybe inside they don't necessarily think this is right or B or they don't want

703
00:41:28.301 --> 00:41:32.320
to be doing this but they don't want to abandon their friends and their friends

704
00:41:32.321 --> 00:41:34.040
are looking at them thinking the same thing

705
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.940
<v 2>and you just have this vicious cycle.
You know the isn't one of these things.</v>

706
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:38.600
Yeah.

707
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.600
And part of the problem there is the human willingness to rationalize and make

708
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.150
justifications for oneself.
He's like,
well in deck again,

709
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.060
cause you know when you look at the principles that people hold,

710
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:53.690
like what they believe their philosophy of life is and the way they behave,

711
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.690
even you match more ordinary circumstances.

712
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:59.150
I mean you made the example of the cheating husband,
right?

713
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:04.250
How many people seriously believe that monogamy is the right thing and you don't

714
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:07.610
cheat on your spouse?
There will be lots and lots and lots of people who say,

715
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:11.000
yeah,
of course I believe in it.
How many people actually live up to it?

716
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:15.980
And it's like,
come on man,
that's not nobody's shooting at you or nobody.

717
00:42:15.981 --> 00:42:19.610
There are no,
it's a match.
More mellow situation.

718
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:24.670
And people in many cases can to live up to their ideals in very ordinary

719
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:25.970
circumstances,

720
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.870
let alone when you start pressing the buttons and when the circumstances are no

721
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:30.770
longer horrid Ari.

722
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:34.520
But it's becomes real panic time and stress and all of that goes up.

723
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.180
So to me it's like you need to have almost a maniacal determination to FD

724
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:44.960
discord of condo that you will hold up no matter what happens.

725
00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.770
Like I use it as,
it's a joke,
but it is not a joke.

726
00:42:48.771 --> 00:42:52.970
Like I use it for daily life as like to me once I am very few more other roles

727
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.620
that are absolutes.
But the ones that are,
there are no exceptions.
So for me,

728
00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:01.610
like if you give your word to somebody,
there are no exception.

729
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:06.080
It's like don't give your word unless you are 110% sure you're going to keep it.

730
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:07.940
Don't,
I don't mind.
You know,

731
00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:10.370
we can have a regular conversation and you don't give your word,

732
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.020
but if you do give your award to me there is no,
oh sorry.

733
00:43:15.021 --> 00:43:18.140
I didn't think in that situation are there was that exception to me.

734
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:21.350
The only way you apologize is a summer I style,
you know,

735
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:24.860
you stick a knife in your belly and use lives back and forth.
That's how you say,

736
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:29.240
sorry.
There is no exception to that.
It's almost as if,
uh,
you have the,

737
00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.120
that those rules serve as pollsters.

738
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.630
When you're in a situation that's as chaotic as something like,
yeah.

739
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.710
Combat where you have to have a few rules that,

740
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.610
I mean maybe they're arbitrary but you'll die for them because when you're in

741
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:44.570
the midst of a situation that is completely outside the realm of your normal

742
00:43:44.571 --> 00:43:48.700
experience,
uh,
they give you reference points,
you know,
they get,

743
00:43:48.701 --> 00:43:52.610
they structure the situation a little bit for you so you're not just lost in

744
00:43:52.611 --> 00:43:56.600
chaos.
There's some structure to it and then you can evaluate the rest of the

745
00:43:56.601 --> 00:43:59.510
environment relative to those hard and fast rules that you've got.

746
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:01.070
Because in the situation,

747
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.730
you know when you're in me lie and you're one of the people who's kind of on the

748
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:06.740
fence,
but now people are shooting,

749
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.350
that is not the time to have this argument with yourself.
No,

750
00:44:10.351 --> 00:44:12.500
that's not when you're going to figure it out.
Yeah,
for sure.

751
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:18.140
Well this might sound really obvious and it is,
it's a very simple,

752
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.330
obvious answer to this really,

753
00:44:20.331 --> 00:44:24.950
really hard question of how do you prevent this thing from happening or who's

754
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:28.160
the kind of person that will stand up?
And the answer is it's actually,

755
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:32.280
it's quite simple.
It's training and education,
it's training

756
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.113
<v 0>and education.</v>

757
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:38.270
And if people understand that these kind of things can happen and they get put

758
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:43.410
in these pressers situations and they get trained and they get debriefed on

759
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:47.550
mistakes that they made and they saw that they got emotional and you train them

760
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.384
correctly,

761
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:53.660
well then you've got someone who gets into a me lies situation and and says to

762
00:44:54.121 --> 00:44:58.930
themselves,
wait a second,
we're not getting shot at right now.
Cease Fire.
And,

763
00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:02.760
and that was the most incredible thing about that story is that's all it took

764
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.630
was a one leader to say,
hey,
stop killing people.
And they,

765
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:08.490
they literally stopped at that moment.

766
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:14.330
So training people and putting them in these situations and educating them so

767
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:19.650
that they understand so that they have pattern recognition,

768
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.380
training them so that they can learn how to detach,

769
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.500
training them so that they can control their emotions,
training them,

770
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:30.450
that they can see when horrible things are unfolding before them and then how

771
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:33.990
that they,
they can put a stop to them.
That is what is important.

772
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.720
And as you mentioned,
Daryl,
as the,

773
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.910
as the Vietnam War drove on,
that the training got less and less than that.

774
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.000
The officers were getting sent over quicker and quicker and you're getting on

775
00:45:45.001 --> 00:45:46.610
the job training and the person that you're getting on,

776
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.800
on the job training from is a person that's only been doing it for two and a

777
00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:53.790
half months longer than you.
And that's,
that's how these things occur.

778
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.380
So you have to invest in,
in,
in people that are going to be in these situations.

779
00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:01.050
And it's the same thing again.
I tell this to businesses all the time,

780
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.910
have you done,
you know,
on a construction site,
have you done a drill?

781
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:08.270
If you have a mass casualty,
w do you know what,

782
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.220
you know where you're going to call in casualty evacuation?

783
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:12.860
Do you know we're getting into what the air,

784
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.060
air flight are a life flight numbers?

785
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.600
Does anyone have the life flight number here?
Because if someone gets hurt,

786
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.050
you need to make that call.
And do you know what station you're going to call,

787
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.210
what helicopter you're going to call?
Do you know where they're going to land?

788
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.190
Why would you not run those things?

789
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.830
And if those things unfold and you're not prepared for them,

790
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:29.731
you're going to fall apart.

791
00:46:29.731 --> 00:46:34.731
And it's the same thing with these ethical and moral situations where if you

792
00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:39.150
don't understand what they are and you don't understand what can go wrong,

793
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.910
you're gonna have,
you're gonna have a bad day.

794
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.330
<v 2>And I felt he was,</v>

795
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.230
but he didn't know what you brought up a little bit ago when you said there are

796
00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:53.660
steps along the way that long before the crisis manifest itself.

797
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:58.490
There's that ability to recognize the tiny little steps that are leading there.

798
00:46:58.491 --> 00:47:00.560
Now when you look at the tiny thing,
it looks tiny.

799
00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:04.280
It doesn't look like a big deal.
That's no crisis that it's not a problem,

800
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:08.930
but he's that first step that's taking you down that path and it's a lot easier

801
00:47:08.931 --> 00:47:11.690
to stop it orally than when crisis is on.

802
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.100
And so in that sense that does become a training that does become a thing of

803
00:47:16.101 --> 00:47:17.900
like how do you recognize the steps,

804
00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:21.050
how do you work on it and you know you are saying seeing so like even something

805
00:47:21.051 --> 00:47:22.950
as magic.
I hate buddy too and sack on.

806
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.400
Take one second to breathe before you react.

807
00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.710
Then seeing how you want to react is the same thing that applies to everything.

808
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:33.010
It applies to conversational.
When people are people you cared about,

809
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:34.450
maybe are getting you angry,

810
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:39.400
do you really want to respond right away or maybe take 30 seconds to take a

811
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:42.130
breath,
then decide how you want to respond.
You know,

812
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.940
and I think he's like to me is we are at as silly as that.

813
00:47:46.941 --> 00:47:51.580
He's because you know clearly war and Pat I in are very far you'll need versus

814
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:54.230
I've seen so many ways but to me as being one of the seat,

815
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.110
if I think of the Archie,
it's I guess I got four class,

816
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.620
but I guess to me has been one of the most and forgiving mirrors that I added.

817
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:09.361
I ever had poutine front of me was seen our way or react under extreme stress

818
00:48:09.941 --> 00:48:13.190
when you haven't slept for two days when somebody is throwing a fee,

819
00:48:13.191 --> 00:48:16.720
so that's completely unjustified when and sad.
Then he's like,
yeah,

820
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:20.440
you have a little bit good reasons to be mad by really this is how you respond,

821
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.700
this is how you will react to a four year old kid was just being a 40 year old

822
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:24.951
key.

823
00:48:24.951 --> 00:48:29.790
Then you get all emotional and do study island and suddenly like 10 Saquon seem

824
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:34.080
to me blow it up.
I see myself from the outside and I'm like,
um,

825
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.480
every scene that I despise in this moment to know that man right there,

826
00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:41.380
that's the responding their way as all the reasons as all the,
I can see.

827
00:48:41.381 --> 00:48:44.440
Why does it matter that you still don't do it?
You know?

828
00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.100
And rather than just being like,
okay,
let's wait for myself,

829
00:48:48.101 --> 00:48:50.890
I'm a horrible human being.
I discovered that.
He's like,
okay,

830
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:54.950
what can I do now to get the,
or next time you got real world world

831
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.270
<v 0>training,
right?</v>

832
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.630
Because now you recognize the situation and now you don't let it happen anymore.

833
00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:04.400
Exactly.
You know,
I had,
I was talking to you guys earlier,
we,
I hit it,

834
00:49:04.401 --> 00:49:07.110
my first deployment to Iraq,
we went and hit a target and,

835
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:11.090
and it sounds almost like,
you know,
like what you'd imagine in a movie.

836
00:49:11.091 --> 00:49:15.440
We'd get handed a map then on the map and to be a city block and Baghdad and

837
00:49:15.441 --> 00:49:18.920
there'd be a red x on one of the buildings and that's all I needed.

838
00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.250
Oh you want me to go hit that red x?
Cool,
we'll go hit that red x.

839
00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:27.380
And one night we went and hit,
you know,
the building with the red x on it.

840
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.470
And when we hit the target,
it was,
you know,

841
00:49:30.471 --> 00:49:33.590
like the most normal family you could ever imagine.

842
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.400
And as we started talking to them and we had our interpreter get in there and

843
00:49:37.401 --> 00:49:40.430
figure out,
hey,
do you know who this person is?
They're like,
yeah,

844
00:49:40.431 --> 00:49:42.350
he lives two doors down.
Oh,
okay.

845
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.480
And so then I went back and eventually said to myself a question that if I

846
00:49:47.481 --> 00:49:50.250
wasn't,
if I had more experience,
I would have asked this question from you.

847
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:55.150
I said,
Hey,
I've got a question.
Who put that red x on that building and why?

848
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:58.390
Right.
And as I pulled the string on it,
it,
you know,

849
00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.990
it was one of those things where they had gotten some Intel,
which you know,

850
00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:07.070
I won't talk about where it came from,
but it was,
it was intel that,
you know,

851
00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.480
put it in that general vicinity and they like pick the center of the general

852
00:50:11.481 --> 00:50:11.931
vicinity.

853
00:50:11.931 --> 00:50:15.600
There's the senator of the genitals and either they will put the x and no follow

854
00:50:15.601 --> 00:50:19.100
up.
And so I always taught that as something,
hey guys,

855
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:21.920
make sure you know who's giving you this intelligence.
And that's,

856
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:25.670
that's the case that happened to me.
Lie where the f the person on the,
no one,

857
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:30.260
no one at the platoon said,
hey,
whoa,
hold on a second.

858
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:35.290
Who's who's confirming that this is 100% VC in this village?

859
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:38.930
A hunch.
You're telling me this is 100% VC in this village.

860
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.290
That's what we're saying right now.
Who's talking,
who's saying that?

861
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.520
I want to talk to that person.

862
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.640
And that's another thing I talk about all the time is

863
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:48.280
<v 3>okay,</v>

864
00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.430
<v 0>you don't as a leader,
you don't want to be surrounded by yes men.</v>

865
00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.070
You don't want to be surrounded by yes.
Men.
And you know,

866
00:50:54.071 --> 00:50:56.440
we're talking about the horrors of Vietnam War and I'm reading another book

867
00:50:56.441 --> 00:51:00.370
right now and there's a platoon commander and his guys are going there.

868
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:05.140
They're rotating between three locations and two of the locations are not too

869
00:51:05.141 --> 00:51:09.820
bad.
The other locations is a nightmare.
It's,
it's,
it's Vietnam war stereotypical.

870
00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:12.700
It's booby traps,
snipers and indirect fire.

871
00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:17.740
They never see the enemy.
They just never see the enemy.

872
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:22.780
And all they do is they go out there on patrol,
they get blown up,

873
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.380
they get shot,
they get mortared,
and they never see the enemy and the guy,

874
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:28.750
the guys are getting wounded or killed.
And

875
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.730
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

876
00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:31.960
<v 0>as you think about that,</v>

877
00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.430
<v 3>yeah,</v>

878
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:34.270
<v 0>I would,</v>

879
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:40.690
I would pray that if I was the company commander or the battalion commander,

880
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:45.650
that that platoon commander would come to me and say,
Hey Jocko,

881
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:50.250
this is stupid.
Let me tell you how many people we've lost any time,

882
00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.560
any other of the platoons of lost.

883
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.910
And let me tell you what we've gotten out of it.

884
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:55.730
We've got nothing out of it and we,

885
00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.070
we need to stop this or we need to find a better way to do it.

886
00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.900
If you want to send us in there,
let us set up a strong point.
Let us set up a,

887
00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:04.490
a bunkered position and we'll stay in.
We'll observe,

888
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.130
but us just walking around in there waiting to get blown up.

889
00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:10.520
Makes no sense whatsoever.
Please,
let's do something else.

890
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:14.540
And as a leader you have to have the open mind to say,
okay,

891
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:19.040
I thank you,
I appreciate that feedback.
What are your suggestions?

892
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:21.740
You've been in the area of operations.
How do you recommend we do it?

893
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:27.250
And whenever I hear these stories of guys that get put in really terrible

894
00:52:27.411 --> 00:52:30.560
situations in the military,
it,
it sickens my heart.

895
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:35.450
Because what you need is a culture inside any organization.
The military,
yes,

896
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.410
but any organization of people to raise their hands and say,
Hey,
wait a second,

897
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.360
this is stupid.
Hey,
wait a second.

898
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:46.010
Do I not see an American flag on that Indian reservation with a white piece flag

899
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:49.520
underneath it and wait,
wait,
hold on.
Stop.
Why wait,
wait,
stop.

900
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.950
And that takes moral courage.

901
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:57.310
It takes training and it takes a culture inside an organization to stop people

902
00:52:57.351 --> 00:52:58.640
and question what they're doing.

903
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.480
And it takes a certain level of detachment that you were talking.

904
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:04.060
It absolutely takes detachment.
You know,
it's like,
uh,

905
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.950
you were saying about like dealing with a four year old or something.

906
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:10.910
Like when you're in the middle of it.
Yeah,
it's seems normal.

907
00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:14.100
It seems like the way to behave.
And it's only when you step back and say,
well,

908
00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:15.670
the,
you know,
uh,

909
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.760
one of the things about human beings are great strength I suppose is that we're

910
00:53:19.761 --> 00:53:21.590
Supreme Lee,
adaptable creatures.

911
00:53:21.591 --> 00:53:26.250
I was talking to a psychologist one time,
used to work for the State Department

912
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.730
<v 1>and he would,
uh,
you worked in Africa for awhile and he talked about,</v>

913
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:33.070
he was telling me some of the stuff that he would encounter whole villages,
um,

914
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:37.230
where every woman had been raped 10 times,
uh,

915
00:53:37.231 --> 00:53:40.350
over the years where kids in this village had watched their parents killed.

916
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:43.950
Just horrifying stuff.
And my question to them at the time,

917
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:47.700
cause he was a psychologist,
uh,
was,
I mean,
how are are,

918
00:53:47.701 --> 00:53:52.590
are these people not just completely blown out with Ptsd and everything else?

919
00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:56.340
Like how are they functional at all given what we know about Ptsd and how it

920
00:53:56.341 --> 00:54:00.240
does function under circumstances that are far less severe than that.

921
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.030
And that's what he said.
He said,
you'd be surprised.
Humans are very,

922
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:05.730
very adaptable into them.
This is their environment.

923
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.550
And that can work the other way too though,
you know,

924
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:12.480
that can work in the direction of,
uh,
in the new,
uh,

925
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:15.150
Ken Burns Vietnam documentary,
which is just,

926
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:19.300
I don't know if you've watched it yet,
the products,

927
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:23.100
I think the first two episodes,
so I'm one of the ones you're coming up on.
Uh,

928
00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:27.660
the name of it is,
this is what we do.
And it starts out talking about this,

929
00:54:27.661 --> 00:54:31.260
get new recruit and he shows up to this place and like the first thing he sees

930
00:54:31.261 --> 00:54:35.460
when he gets to a,
the base he's at,
it's not a mask or anything like that,

931
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:39.760
but it's just sort of a,
you know,
a Vietnamese prisoner or,
or a captive,
uh,

932
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.370
being led along by,
you know,

933
00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:44.670
a corporal or something and he's just being rough with them and kind of push

934
00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:48.060
them along and doing stuff that clearly is outside of regulations.

935
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.660
And this new guy shows up and he's like,
Hey,

936
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:52.890
like you supposed to be doing that or whatever it is.

937
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.030
And the first thing he hears when he gets over there,
his kid,
this is Vietnam,

938
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:57.930
this is what we do.

939
00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.680
And he said that their whole rest of the time that he was there when he saw

940
00:55:01.681 --> 00:55:04.890
something he didn't like when he was doing things that he wasn't sure about,

941
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:08.340
he just repeated in his head,
this is Vietnam,
this is what we do,

942
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.390
this is what we do.
And after a while he didn't have to repeat it anymore.

943
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:16.890
After a while that was his environment.
And you know,
it reminds me,

944
00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:18.630
I used to have these recurring dreams.

945
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:21.120
I probably shouldn't share this on the air,
but,
um,

946
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.000
I used to have these recurring dreams.
I still have them every once in a while.

947
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:28.920
Uh,
the details and the setting differ,
but um,
it'll be something like,
um,

948
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.820
the dream starts and I'm in like a helicopter say,

949
00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:37.200
and I'm flying around like a city like la or wherever and I'm just shooting

950
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:40.380
people like grand theft auto.
It's just like a video game Tryna Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,

951
00:55:40.381 --> 00:55:42.240
Dah.
And I'm going through and I'm doing all this.

952
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:43.320
Sometimes there's people down there,

953
00:55:43.321 --> 00:55:45.960
I know my friends and stuff and it's just all,

954
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.710
it seems just like I'm in a video game.
And then the way the dream goes,

955
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.770
is it a certain point after a few minutes of this,

956
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.620
all of a sudden it hits me what I'm doing and I look around and I,

957
00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:59.130
it's almost as if I wake up in the dream and I'm like,
oh my God,

958
00:55:59.131 --> 00:56:01.530
like I'm killing all these people.
What,
what am I doing?

959
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.890
But at the time it was completely normal.

960
00:56:04.891 --> 00:56:08.760
It seemed exactly like this is just what I should be doing or anything like
that.

961
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.370
And that's something that I think that is,

962
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:15.360
well it's why you told people stop looking down the barrel of your gun.
You know,

963
00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:18.870
you got to step back and be able to get that distance so you can change your

964
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:21.390
frame.
And again,
with the proper training

965
00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:24.400
and the proper education,

966
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:29.700
<v 0>you will know as a leader that that behavior will escalate,</v>

967
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.570
that behavior will escalate.
And if you allow it to happen,

968
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.600
it will continue to get worse.
And so it starts off,

969
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.560
and I've read all kinds of books about,
about Vietnam,

970
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:45.940
especially about Vietnam,
where it starts off,
it starts off with,
hey,

971
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.780
the villagers are,
we kind of know them,
everything's cool,
give them lollipops,

972
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.700
but then you know,
one of our guys dies and then what?

973
00:56:52.701 --> 00:56:54.250
We're not getting lollipops.
As a matter of fact,

974
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:57.850
we're kicking the kids away and it,
it only escalates to their,

975
00:56:57.851 --> 00:57:02.050
and it escalates to murder and it escalates.

976
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.570
Or I should say this,
it can escalate.

977
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:09.520
It doesn't automatically escalate because all it takes is someone to step in and

978
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:13.330
say,
Hey,
no,
that's across the line.
But you know what,
you want to slap a guy.

979
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:17.830
I get it,
I get it.
But that's the line.

980
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.710
Anything once,
you know,
one thing that we used to say,

981
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:24.250
and I used to tell my guys once the cuffs are on somebody,

982
00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:26.020
so once we get somebody zip-tied it's over.

983
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.780
But you do what you gotta do to get a guy under control.

984
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.100
Once they're zip uptight,
it's done.
And now they're,
they're,

985
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:37.540
they're getting taken care of and you,
you treat them firm but fair.

986
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.070
That's it.
And so those lines,
you,

987
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.840
you have to draw them and you have to hold the line as a leader because things

988
00:57:43.841 --> 00:57:44.560
start to escalate it,
you know,

989
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.160
says the thing that you were asking me about earlier about the,
the,

990
00:57:47.161 --> 00:57:50.260
the Chechen war and the Russians against the Chechens and it's,

991
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.160
they didn't,
they didn't hold the line with the little things.

992
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.480
And that when you lose that discipline,
even up on the smaller things,

993
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.530
well eventually then you don't have the discipline on the bigger things.

994
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:04.990
Can you go overboard with that?
Yes,
you can.

995
00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.230
I can hold the discipline so hard on the little things that no one listens to me

996
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:09.064
on the big things.

997
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.560
That's why leadership is hard because there's a dichotomy there that you have to

998
00:58:11.561 --> 00:58:15.520
balance.
You can't be freaked out because you know,
you didn't,

999
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:20.380
you didn't blouse your boots when you were supposed to,
but at the same time,

1000
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:25.540
if I start to let too many things slide well it will escalate.

1001
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.490
<v 1>And it seems like maybe with things like that,</v>

1002
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:32.220
a lot of people who were civilians,
they,
they laugh when they see in movies or

1003
00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:37.300
TV shows or something about how soldiers in combat are still expected to groom

1004
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:37.921
themselves,

1005
00:58:37.921 --> 00:58:40.840
are still expected to take care of themselves and comport themselves in a

1006
00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:43.960
military way.
And what I tell them a lot of the times is,

1007
00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.380
and maybe you can confirm this because I don't really know what I'm talking

1008
00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:51.550
about,
but it is that,
uh,
you know,
my feeling on,
uh,
on,

1009
00:58:51.551 --> 00:58:56.551
on why that stuff is so important is that you can't have,

1010
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.900
uh,
you know,
you can't have Iraq in the sectarian war in all the stuff,

1011
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:03.550
the storm that's going on around them.

1012
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.510
You can't have that become the environment to which they're adapting the

1013
00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:10.300
environment to which they need to be well adapted as the u s military.

1014
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.390
That's their environment.
That's what they're focused on,

1015
00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:15.790
following these rules and behaving in this way.

1016
00:59:15.791 --> 00:59:17.920
And then when that's their environment,

1017
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:21.380
they can go into these places and do their jobs if they get in there and start

1018
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:24.690
reacting to what's going on around them.
Because I mean,
you,

1019
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:29.480
you then you can tell a guy talking about going native.
Yeah.
Native,

1020
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:32.060
you know,
once a apocalypse now,
right?

1021
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:36.350
You can tell a guy once the cuffs are on.
Uh,
but you know,
if,

1022
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:40.790
if I was talking to a family yesterday and this is the guy that just cut their

1023
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:45.620
heads off,
well,
I mean,
you know,

1024
00:59:45.621 --> 00:59:47.150
you,
you can't have,

1025
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.260
you can't put yourself in a situation because it does make sense to beat the

1026
00:59:51.261 --> 00:59:51.951
shit out of that guy.

1027
00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:54.920
It does make sense to put a bullet in his head when the cuffs are on,

1028
00:59:54.921 --> 00:59:58.110
like from a,
even from a moral standpoint in certain ways like that,

1029
00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.980
you can justify that,
you know?
Um,

1030
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.150
and so that's why you can't be reacting to whatever it is it's going on.

1031
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.070
And it sounds like that's kind of what you're saying.

1032
01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:11.100
<v 0>Yeah.
And there's actually an interesting dichotomy there as well,
because</v>

1033
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:16.290
you,
you need to follow the rules,
right?

1034
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.410
Because if I told,
if the three of us decided,
hey,

1035
01:00:19.411 --> 01:00:23.910
we're going to go on this village raid and we're all going to use our morals as

1036
01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:26.880
our guide,
well,
we have three different scenarios.
You're,

1037
01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:30.450
you just admitted that you'd be executing somebody that was already handcuffed,

1038
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:35.340
uh,
who knows what you'd be doing.
You know,
I don't even want to know.
Right.
So,

1039
01:00:35.341 --> 01:00:38.520
so we were all over the map,
right?
Maybe you're,
maybe you're saying you're,

1040
01:00:38.521 --> 01:00:39.170
you're not even going,

1041
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:42.000
I don't even want to handcuff anyone cause you think that's too offensive and

1042
01:00:42.001 --> 01:00:45.570
I'm somewhere in the middle.
Whatever the case may be,
we're all over the map.

1043
01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:50.550
So I would always tell the guys,
look,
you need to do what is legal,

1044
01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:52.170
what's legal?

1045
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:57.450
But then the paradox of that is sometimes what you can get away with the legally

1046
01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:01.230
still isn't the right thing to do.
And that's again,

1047
01:01:01.231 --> 01:01:02.910
that's why there's a dichotomy between those two.

1048
01:01:02.911 --> 01:01:07.590
Between do I follow the rules exactly.
Or I mean,
you know,
look at,

1049
01:01:07.591 --> 01:01:10.620
look at me.
I look at Sand Creek that my boss told me to shoot.

1050
01:01:10.621 --> 01:01:13.260
This guy told me to shoot this three year old baby.

1051
01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.600
My boss told me to do that.
I am,
I should I be following orders?

1052
01:01:18.601 --> 01:01:22.170
Is there a threat that I don't know about?
You know,
these days,
you know,

1053
01:01:22.171 --> 01:01:26.970
I've heard a lot of stories now the guys that that took down Mozel right?

1054
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:29.160
The,
the enemy was sending,

1055
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:34.340
surrendering children to come and surrender to coalition forces.

1056
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:39.000
And they would be strapped with,
uh,
id vests,
suicide vests,

1057
01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:44.400
and over and over and over again,
it was our US military,
you know,
especially our,

1058
01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:46.310
our explosive ordinance disposal folks and the,

1059
01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.010
that we're going in disarming these bombs on these kids.

1060
01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.200
But yeah,

1061
01:01:52.201 --> 01:01:57.201
how do you feel after you see two or three of those little kids get killed plus

1062
01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:00.900
two or three EOD guys get killed and now you're going to fight those guys and

1063
01:02:00.901 --> 01:02:03.390
they want to surrender.
That's a very challenging thing.

1064
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.980
And if you don't maintain discipline,
it's a slippery slope.

1065
01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:10.830
And it's funny because we're saying two seats

1066
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:13.180
<v 1>said the same time,
which sound contradictory.</v>

1067
01:02:13.181 --> 01:02:17.730
And yet that's life that on one end you need to have the super strict rules.

1068
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.570
They are not going to bend under circumstances.
And on the other end,

1069
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.790
your thing that you rightly point out too is the Fed.

1070
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:26.580
That real leadership is also the ability to think on your feet.

1071
01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:28.290
And no two situations are alike.

1072
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:31.870
So the rule following approach,

1073
01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.270
while he may save you from some of the worst abuses is not always necessarily

1074
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:36.871
the right thing.

1075
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:41.520
And there is also the time when we all lost follow the rules except when we

1076
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:45.420
don't because that's the one time when it's correct and that ability to make the

1077
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:47.130
right call at the right time,

1078
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.800
that's what make you an makes that are already in our human being.

1079
01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.590
Just sort of in debates are popping off at the mouth today.
We,

1080
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.290
we sort of take for granted that the whole,
um,
I was just following orders.

1081
01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:00.720
Question was settled at Nuremberg.
It was not settled at all.

1082
01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:03.870
That's an incredibly complicated question for just the reason you were

1083
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:05.610
describing.
You know,
uh,

1084
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.170
somebody who worked at a Nazi death camp,
um,

1085
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.190
you know,

1086
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:15.870
they didn't make 10,000 independent decisions to kill somebody.

1087
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:21.060
Uh,
they made one decision that their own personal moral compass was going to get

1088
01:03:21.061 --> 01:03:24.630
outsourced to the state and that they were going to do their duty and follow

1089
01:03:24.631 --> 01:03:27.030
their orders.
They made that decision once and now,

1090
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:29.880
once you've made that decision and you've outsourced your moral compass,

1091
01:03:29.881 --> 01:03:30.714
which again,

1092
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:36.410
under most circumstances that might be the thing that keeps you from doing the

1093
01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:39.870
wrong thing now might be the thing that keeps me from executing that,
you know,

1094
01:03:39.871 --> 01:03:40.710
I'll kind of guy.

1095
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:44.610
But when the institutions themselves start to get warped or if you're in,
even,

1096
01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:49.380
even if the institution is an individual unit or something,
you know,
uh,
it's,

1097
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:53.130
uh,
I can't remember where I heard it,
but there's a,

1098
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:56.220
some zoologist or somebody who pointed out to him that,
uh,

1099
01:03:56.310 --> 01:04:01.310
he had asked why zebras have black and white stripes when the grass is gold

1100
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:04.530
colored in yellow and they don't blend into that at all.

1101
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:05.820
Clearly Tigers can see that.

1102
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:08.790
And he pointed out to him that that camouflage isn't to blend into the

1103
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:12.600
environment.
That camouflage is to blend in with each other.

1104
01:04:12.601 --> 01:04:17.010
They blend with the herd.
And so the Tigers have a difficult time tracking down,

1105
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:20.820
like in focusing on an individual.
And,
uh,
they,
oh,

1106
01:04:20.821 --> 01:04:22.800
they figured that out because they wanted to try to,
you know,

1107
01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:25.260
put ear clips on them or something to track these things around.

1108
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.840
But they noticed every time they put something identifiable on one of them,

1109
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:31.230
the Tigers would kill it.
And it was because now they had something to focus on.

1110
01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:33.270
And so,
and that's,
you know,

1111
01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:35.790
I'm not making a literal evolutionary comparison here,

1112
01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:37.950
but there's an interesting like,
just sort of analogy,

1113
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:40.890
which is this instinct to blend in with the herd.

1114
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:45.810
There's just their safety there.
There's a sense of security there and there's,

1115
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:50.811
there's virtue in for fitting a certain amount of your personal judgment to the

1116
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:53.280
group to which you have obligations.

1117
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:56.020
That's a good thing under most circumstances.
You know what mean,

1118
01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.380
at least in a lot of circumstances,
you know,
that's what duty is.
That's what,
um,

1119
01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.590
you know,
just fulfilling your obligations to your people or you,
you,
you,

1120
01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.880
your unit or something.
Like,
who are you?

1121
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.050
Especially if you're an 18 year old kid who just got out of high school and

1122
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:13.440
you're over there and you're in a situation where you've got,
you know,

1123
01:05:13.441 --> 01:05:17.530
like in me lie,
you've got officers,
you've got uh,
you know,

1124
01:05:17.531 --> 01:05:18.940
not just your immediate officer,

1125
01:05:18.941 --> 01:05:21.940
but it seems to be being reinforced by your captain above,
you know,

1126
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:25.120
your company commander at the time,
and me lie,
there was a,

1127
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:29.470
there was a major general in a helicopter observing,
buzzing around that place.

1128
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.880
And so,
you know,
you're in a situation where you say to yourself like,

1129
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.390
who am I to say that what's going on here is wrong?

1130
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:42.130
It seems wrong to me because of what I learned from my Mama or whatever.

1131
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.150
But you know what,
what does that mean?
I've got a captain,
I've got a lieutenant,

1132
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:50.110
I've got my sergeant's,
I've got this major general in the air.
And you know,

1133
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.610
maybe I'm wrong,
maybe this,
you know,
I just got here four months ago.
This was my,

1134
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.800
this is a Charlie company's first major combat operation.
There's,

1135
01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.390
they really hadn't made contact,
direct combat with the enemy.

1136
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.020
And this is the first time any of them have seen combat for the most part.

1137
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.470
And I think it's uh,
um,

1138
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:11.200
there's certainly a certain amount of weakness that's involved like you were

1139
01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:12.034
talking about.

1140
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:15.800
But I also think there's a certain amount of moral confusion that happens and

1141
01:06:15.801 --> 01:06:18.490
that's,
that's,
there can't be that kind of confusion.

1142
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:20.980
Like that is where leadership has got to take over.

1143
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:25.260
<v 0>Well,
I can add another layer of complexity to this.
Okay.
So,
so first of all,</v>

1144
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:29.670
I do think that the,
well Napoleon said,

1145
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:34.300
if you execute an order that you know is wrong and what he was talking about it,

1146
01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:35.190
he's not talking about something.

1147
01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.710
And while he's talking about if I do something where a bunch of my men get

1148
01:06:37.711 --> 01:06:41.430
killed because the general said to do it and I do it,
I'm culpable.

1149
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.860
So that's,

1150
01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:46.890
that's pretty clear that if your boss tells you to do something that you know is

1151
01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:50.640
gonna in Napoleon's case he was getting a bunch of your guys killed then,

1152
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:53.490
then you say no.
And if you do it,
you're culpable for what happens.

1153
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:54.630
You could say the same thing.

1154
01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:58.770
If if I get told to do something that's morally or ethically wrong and I do it

1155
01:06:58.771 --> 01:07:01.620
well,
guess what?
Then I'm responsible for that.
What?

1156
01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:06.621
What becomes a little bit complicated to me or adds another layer of complexity

1157
01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:07.524
is this.

1158
01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:13.350
If I'm going to sand creek and I'm with Chington and he or she havington and he

1159
01:07:13.351 --> 01:07:17.610
says,
Hey,
we're going to go there and we're going to execute this and we're,

1160
01:07:17.611 --> 01:07:19.740
we're,
we're going to kill these guys.
We're going to,

1161
01:07:19.741 --> 01:07:24.330
we're going to conduct a raid,
and I don't believe in it.

1162
01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.110
Okay?
So I say,
you know what?
I don't believe in it.

1163
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.400
I don't think it's the right thing to do.

1164
01:07:29.401 --> 01:07:32.250
I think that we've made enough peace with them.
We've caused enough problems.

1165
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.160
That's their land.
I'm not going,
okay,

1166
01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.550
so now you don't go because you didn't believe in the mission.
Well,

1167
01:07:38.551 --> 01:07:39.840
now who's out there conducting the mission?

1168
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:42.180
Everyone that's going out there can come to conduct.

1169
01:07:42.181 --> 01:07:46.650
The mission is people that are compliant with what he's saying.
So you would be,

1170
01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:51.900
you would be morally a better person if you said,
okay,

1171
01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.470
I'm going to go ahead and do this because if I don't,

1172
01:07:55.471 --> 01:08:00.240
I know it's going to be someone that's totally compliant with Shervington and

1173
01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:02.970
I'd rather be there to at least spare some of the people,

1174
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.870
which we know people did.
And so there's,

1175
01:08:07.871 --> 01:08:10.290
there's a little complex,
you know,
I talk about this in the business world too.

1176
01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:13.000
People say,
my boss told me to do this and,
and I,

1177
01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.320
I think it's a bad idea and I don't think we should do it.
Okay,

1178
01:08:15.321 --> 01:08:18.140
so are you going to get put off the project?

1179
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:19.850
Are you going to get pulled to a different,

1180
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.070
a different department where you no longer can take care cause you,

1181
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:26.900
you listen too hard on my people,
I'm the,
I refuse to do this.
Okay,
that's fine.

1182
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.950
You refuse to do this.

1183
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:31.370
I'll put someone in there that won't refuse and you no longer can protect your

1184
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:34.560
people and your people in a worse situation.
So you know,

1185
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:38.540
there's organization is degraded the whole organization.
So you raise your hand,

1186
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:43.550
you make your protest,
but sometimes you've got to say,
okay,

1187
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:48.530
I've made my protest and I understand that you're still wanting me to do this.

1188
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.720
And even though I think it's the wrong thing to do,

1189
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.760
I'm going to proceed down the path because I'd rather me be able to mitigate as

1190
01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:59.420
much of this problem as I can.
Then have somebody that's just going to do,
do,

1191
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.510
do this to the fullest extent that you would want them to do.

1192
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:07.730
So there's another additional complexity there that it gets involved.

1193
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:09.730
<v 2>Absolutely.
Cause some time,
as you said,</v>

1194
01:09:09.731 --> 01:09:12.930
just denying you're just making yourself feel better.

1195
01:09:12.931 --> 01:09:15.280
But the reality is that plan is going to go ahead.

1196
01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:18.340
You are the only thing that's standing in the way of that plan.

1197
01:09:18.341 --> 01:09:22.830
Going to the 100 percentile.
You can bring it down to 50 you know,

1198
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.310
he's still gonna feel Aga.

1199
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.010
You are still going to feel part of something you don't want to be part of.

1200
01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.540
But the only thing you do by refusing is patting yourself on the back and say,

1201
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:35.200
I might all more I the guy.
He's like,
yeah,
but no,
because you know,

1202
01:09:35.201 --> 01:09:39.460
it's like the thing is you can use that power in that situation too for

1203
01:09:39.461 --> 01:09:42.030
something that is better than if you just,
uh,

1204
01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.490
look at herself in the mirror saying how great you are by not doing it.

1205
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:49.240
And in fact,
that's what it was pitching fanatical about the Sun Creek story.

1206
01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.170
Yeah.
Silas soul,
you know,
they,

1207
01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.210
he's told right before you don't want to stay home.

1208
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:57.550
Nobody's forcing you just stay home.

1209
01:09:57.551 --> 01:10:01.330
Don't be part of it and sold qure and some of those guys say,
no,

1210
01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:03.360
we want to be there.
We want to be there.
Cool.

1211
01:10:03.361 --> 01:10:07.780
Observed may be able to make the choice on this boat and uh,

1212
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.610
and it makes a huge difference right there.

1213
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:11.090
<v 1>My feeling on it,</v>

1214
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.540
just sort of looking at it all from the outside is that especially in a

1215
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:15.830
counterinsurgency war,

1216
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:21.040
that without strict military discipline and strong leadership that abject

1217
01:10:22.371 --> 01:10:24.920
savagery is gravity will take you there.

1218
01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:27.980
That's where things will head on their own.

1219
01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.200
Unless you are supreme.

1220
01:10:30.201 --> 01:10:33.500
We focused on discipline and leadership and education and those kinds of things

1221
01:10:33.501 --> 01:10:36.560
that you don't have to,
you don't really have to ask the question,

1222
01:10:36.561 --> 01:10:38.180
how can this kind of thing happen?

1223
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.710
The real question is how does this not happen all the time,
right?

1224
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:46.700
How is it that American soldiers in Iraq and uh,

1225
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:51.380
you know,
you go into Iraq and they're seeing,
uh,

1226
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.031
maybe,

1227
01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:57.110
maybe husbands and fathers that they spoke to the previous day that they know

1228
01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:59.150
are innocent,
not part of the fighting.

1229
01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:03.890
And they see his wife beheaded and him with a power drill hole on the side of

1230
01:11:03.891 --> 01:11:04.724
his head.

1231
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:09.560
How our American soldiers not going and executing reprisal attacks against these

1232
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:10.580
people all the time.

1233
01:11:10.581 --> 01:11:15.581
How has it not just completely getting out of hand and like that to me is by far

1234
01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.270
the more interesting question.
I don't have to ask myself,

1235
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:22.720
how is it that you know,
somebody went and shut up,
you know,
the,
that,

1236
01:11:22.721 --> 01:11:25.800
that the house of the person who did something like that.

1237
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:28.510
That's an easy question to answer.
And,
and the,

1238
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:31.320
the much more interesting one is how it doesn't happen all the time.
And it,

1239
01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:36.100
it seems like it's,
it has to be institutional.
It can't come down to like,
uh,

1240
01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.460
you know,
institutional culture,
right?

1241
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:43.050
I'm relating it to their sense of personal identity and social identity with the

1242
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:47.340
group that this is not who we are.
Um,
that if I do this,

1243
01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:49.760
it's not going to win me any,
uh,

1244
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.860
any Kudos from my teammates or anything like that.

1245
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:56.640
There you're going to look at that as a betrayal because I'm bringing dishonor

1246
01:11:56.641 --> 01:11:58.740
upon us because this is not what we're about.

1247
01:11:58.741 --> 01:12:01.590
And they have to be able to look at it that way.
And if they don't know that,

1248
01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:05.400
if they don't know that,
uh,
by doing something like that,

1249
01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:08.790
they're going to,
uh,
you know,
they want to blend in with the group.

1250
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.110
They want to be accepted by the group.

1251
01:12:10.111 --> 01:12:12.330
They want to be looked at as somebody that can be relied on.

1252
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:16.820
And that has to mean following the rules and doing the right thing.

1253
01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.470
<v 0>Yeah.
Well did Danielle,
you poured it,
pointed this out earlier you,
you said,</v>

1254
01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:26.080
well this seems like it's just the communications aspect is so important and

1255
01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:30.560
that's 100% right.
So as we all know,
the,
the

1256
01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:37.150
strategy in the Vietnam War for America was to kill more of them.

1257
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:42.970
Then they data vos and drop more bombs on them and eventually they'll just break

1258
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:45.620
just a war of attrition.
And,
and so the,

1259
01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:49.580
the strategy was get rack up as many kill,

1260
01:12:49.581 --> 01:12:53.840
count as high kill count as you possibly can.
So that's the messaging,

1261
01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.990
that's the messaging.
So when that's the messaging,

1262
01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.080
that's the messaging in,

1263
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.250
in Iraq they were very clear about,
hey,

1264
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:07.370
we're here too.
We're,
we're not an occupying force.

1265
01:13:07.371 --> 01:13:10.970
We're here to liberate these people were here to secure the populous and make

1266
01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:14.210
sure that they can have a free country.
That's the messaging.

1267
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.640
So does that messaging always make it down to the front lines,

1268
01:13:16.641 --> 01:13:20.960
know that's why we do have incidents where,
you know,
bad,
horrible things happen.

1269
01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:21.853
Absolutely.

1270
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:27.250
But it is about the messaging and it is about everyone understanding why they're

1271
01:13:27.501 --> 01:13:29.480
doing what they're doing,
what their mission is,

1272
01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:33.200
what is what is right and what is wrong.

1273
01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:36.710
And you can be educated on that legally,
hey,

1274
01:13:36.711 --> 01:13:40.700
you're not allowed to do this.
You can do that,
but you can't do this.

1275
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.720
And then the other point that you made,
which is,
well,

1276
01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:47.510
you said you've got to be able to manage people in a time of crisis as a leader,

1277
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:49.850
but more important.
And you,
you actually,

1278
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:53.870
why you actually asked a really complicated question and then answered it

1279
01:13:53.871 --> 01:13:54.291
yourself.

1280
01:13:54.291 --> 01:13:57.650
And you did that like three times and that one sphere of conversation that you

1281
01:13:57.651 --> 01:14:01.730
had with yourself.
Yeah,
yeah.
Is,
is you said,
you know,

1282
01:14:01.731 --> 01:14:06.020
you gotta be able to manage people in these pressure situations and then you

1283
01:14:06.021 --> 01:14:08.270
added that.
But what you really need is culture.

1284
01:14:08.271 --> 01:14:12.400
And you're right because you're not going to be there.
The leader is not,

1285
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.660
I wasn't with my,
all my elements on the battlefield all the time.

1286
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:19.570
They were out there all the time without me all the time without me.

1287
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.830
They were the ones that had to understand what they could and what they couldn't

1288
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:26.710
do.
They were the ones that had to make those hard decisions.

1289
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:30.850
They weren't calling my snipers,
didn't call back to me and say,
Hey Jocko,

1290
01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:31.810
I see this with this guy.

1291
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:34.810
They didn't even ask their platoon commanders that they didn't ask anyone.

1292
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.910
They knew what the rules of engagement,
where they knew what our strategy was.

1293
01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:43.720
They understood.
And one of the things that I told them,
you know,

1294
01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:46.150
speaking of rules of engagement,
so our rules of engagement was,
you know,

1295
01:14:46.151 --> 01:14:51.151
several page legal document written by some lawyers in Washington DC or

1296
01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:54.010
wherever.
And you know,

1297
01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:59.011
I've got kids in my platoon that are 20 2122 years old,

1298
01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:00.640
you know,

1299
01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.810
high school graduate and they came in the seal teams like I did by the way.

1300
01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.370
And so they're looking at a legal document like that does,

1301
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:09.980
it doesn't mean anything to them.
You know,

1302
01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:13.660
my rules of engagement for them was it very simple.
Make sure that people,

1303
01:15:13.661 --> 01:15:18.640
you're killing our bad.
You make sure the people you're killing her bat and why.

1304
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:20.950
And then I explained to them why that was important.

1305
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:26.070
And the reason why that was important was because the day that some civilians

1306
01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.880
brought a headless body that it had taken a 300 win mag round to the head and

1307
01:15:34.091 --> 01:15:37.390
their head was gone and they said,
this was our a mom,

1308
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:40.450
or this was our school teacher,
or this was our neighborhood doctor,

1309
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:44.740
and one of your snipers killed them and they would figure it out.
It was us.

1310
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:49.840
First of all,
our operations would get shutdown.
So selfishly,

1311
01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.820
we don't want to get our operations shutdown,

1312
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:55.090
but more important than the selfish reason.
If that happened,

1313
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.410
we would leave all the soldiers and marines that we were working with on a daily

1314
01:15:59.411 --> 01:16:01.120
basis that we are providing Overwatch for.

1315
01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:05.710
We've leave them without the support that we had committed to give them because

1316
01:16:05.711 --> 01:16:09.430
we weren't allowed to operate anymore because we weren't being discriminatory

1317
01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:13.060
enough with our fire.
So the culture is so important.

1318
01:16:13.061 --> 01:16:16.150
People understanding why they're doing what they're doing is so important.

1319
01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.010
And if you don't get that messaging into your point,
DNA,
Daniella,

1320
01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:23.680
if you don't get the communication correct,

1321
01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:26.230
then you're going to end up in a world of hurt

1322
01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.120
<v 2>and to point you just made,
make sure the people you key or bad,</v>

1323
01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:35.290
he's such shit.
I think about a day or so few awards,
right?

1324
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.420
You say teen lake,
very,

1325
01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:40.840
very few words and yet he's so centered because you look at,

1326
01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:45.320
not all the curry core me lie,
but look at even like half of the,

1327
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.520
you know when the Nazi seeing invade the Soviet Union and then when the Red Army

1328
01:16:50.591 --> 01:16:53.110
does the counter and they start invading Germany,

1329
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.210
both armies do horrible seeings to one another.
Cv Leon.

1330
01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:01.960
And the idea is,
well the Nazis did to our people.
So we did it today.

1331
01:17:01.961 --> 01:17:06.220
Our swell that Ma'am that you are shooting in the head at it.

1332
01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:09.010
She had nothing to do with what happened to your people.
She's,

1333
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.810
she's not the Nazi soldier would eat it.

1334
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:14.990
She's not the bad one just because she's from the same nation.

1335
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.720
Are you kidding me?
That's not,
that doesn't make her a bad person.

1336
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.380
And I think that's part of the problem.
We group identity that.

1337
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:24.950
So then that's why I stayed with types are dangerous because you start grouping

1338
01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:29.951
individuals into this mental category you may have of like those guys are bad,

1339
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:32.010
that individual,

1340
01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:37.020
I'll only share some physical characteristic with the other one they share maybe

1341
01:17:37.881 --> 01:17:40.940
the or even are related,
but they are not the same person.
You know they are date,

1342
01:17:40.941 --> 01:17:43.820
I haven't made the same choices.
They haven't committed the same action.

1343
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:47.450
So the fact that you three told the Cheyenne the same or you decided to retool

1344
01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.540
the Vietnamese the same or the Germans?
The same oral.
The Russians,

1345
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.340
that's where every single is wrong because he are not making sure that the

1346
01:17:55.341 --> 01:18:00.240
person you're hurting is the bad one is not the one.
There's no revenge dare.

1347
01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.670
They are not the same people.

1348
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:05.350
And so and yet it happens over and over again.

1349
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.330
Where people fall into this idea of group mentality is,

1350
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.420
well I couldn't catch that guy back.

1351
01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:15.050
He's one of the or group is I know man,

1352
01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.720
there are individuals that are involved that are not,

1353
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:21.800
there's no collective guilt off.
It's kind of the same reason why,
for example,

1354
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:25.530
federal reasons strike as I saw all fall in every possible way because you're

1355
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:28.130
now going against the guide.
I have a grievance against.

1356
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:30.470
You're going against the guy from the same nation.

1357
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:35.000
It's like that has nothing to do with one another.
You know,
they're,

1358
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:39.980
I feel like sometimes group identity,
it's one of those double edged swords,

1359
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:44.240
right?
Because on one hand there's a side of it that we mentioned earlier.

1360
01:18:44.241 --> 01:18:49.241
Maybe your loyalty to your group and not wanting to bring dishonor upon them if

1361
01:18:49.401 --> 01:18:53.660
that's the culture is what keeps you from putting a bullet in the head of the

1362
01:18:53.661 --> 01:18:58.400
guy you just cuffed.
Um,
you might be able to appeal to a,

1363
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:02.930
um,
you know,
you can say to people,
hey,

1364
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:06.980
we're Americans and this is not how we behave and you're appealing to their

1365
01:19:06.981 --> 01:19:10.160
group identity there,
you know,
and uh,
that

1366
01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:13.950
nobody's saying it's a double edge sword.

1367
01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:19.260
That is a case in which you are using group identities for as the good guys.
And,

1368
01:19:19.261 --> 01:19:20.180
and granted,
yeah,

1369
01:19:20.181 --> 01:19:23.750
it may not be that every single one from [inaudible] three really feed that idea

1370
01:19:23.751 --> 01:19:27.350
by you're putting a nice ideal and they are encouraging people to live up to it.

1371
01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.420
That's all the IDD furnace from.

1372
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:34.310
While it's similar in dynamics too damned bad guys and flagging everyone into

1373
01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:34.970
dad group,

1374
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:39.970
where do you know that that person really fit that stereotype at the Ui of

1375
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:43.970
[inaudible]?
How did you make clear to your men,
uh,
when you said,
you know,

1376
01:19:43.971 --> 01:19:47.780
make sure the people you're killing or bad that they understood what was meant

1377
01:19:47.781 --> 01:19:50.120
by that.
It is,

1378
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.080
<v 0>well there's first of all there,</v>

1379
01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:57.240
there are specifics and the rules of engagement and one of them is called clear

1380
01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.090
hostile intent,
hostile actor,
hostile intent,

1381
01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:05.120
which means this person has to be doing something actively that's gonna cause it

1382
01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:07.440
cause a negative impact.
Now

1383
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:11.520
you can tell which people are bad.

1384
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.370
You can tell when they're starting to do something that's a hostile act or

1385
01:20:14.371 --> 01:20:19.100
hostile intent.
You can tell.
And these guys,
you know,
my guys would,
they,

1386
01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:21.360
they knew,
they would err on the side of like,

1387
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:25.260
I'm going to make sure that this person is doing something bad.
But you know,

1388
01:20:25.261 --> 01:20:28.890
we had some decent,
uh,
arguments about the rules of engagement.

1389
01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.550
I had some decent arguments about the rules of engagement up the chain of

1390
01:20:32.551 --> 01:20:37.551
command because the rules of engagement were applying to all of Iraq and Ramadi

1391
01:20:37.651 --> 01:20:41.730
was not like the rest of Iraq at this time in 2006.
And you know,

1392
01:20:41.731 --> 01:20:45.960
if you've got someone that is,
for instance,

1393
01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:51.210
observing a location with binoculars,
right?
If you're observing,

1394
01:20:51.211 --> 01:20:56.211
if you're in Baghdad and you're look looking at a location with binoculars,

1395
01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:02.010
you're gathering intelligence,
which is,
which,
which could be considered,

1396
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:05.970
which is not considered a hostile act.
It's,
it's,
it's the intelligence gathering.

1397
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.040
You might suspect the person being bad,
but there's,

1398
01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.950
there's no way to prove that in Ramadi.

1399
01:21:10.951 --> 01:21:15.951
If you saw somebody that was looking with binoculars at friendly forces,

1400
01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:17.820
they weren't gathering intelligence,

1401
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.030
they were absolutely coordinating attack and attack.

1402
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:25.100
And that is a group that is a big difference because that is a hostile act.

1403
01:21:25.101 --> 01:21:27.630
And it's damn sure hostile intent.
And so,
you know,

1404
01:21:27.631 --> 01:21:31.290
those are the kinds of things that I would discuss up the chain of command and

1405
01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.210
we would provide them the resources.
You know,
it's,

1406
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:39.210
I talk a lot about playing the game,
right?

1407
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.180
Like if my boss tells me to do something,
I'm going to play the game.

1408
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:43.600
I'm going to try and do it.
And,
and,

1409
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.510
and occasionally I'll get the question of like,
well,

1410
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.750
what if you get told to do something that you really don't want to do?

1411
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.660
What if you've got told to do something that you didn't,
that you were posed to,

1412
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.230
right?

1413
01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:55.470
What if you got the order to go to the me Lai massacre and you got the order?

1414
01:21:56.130 --> 01:22:00.930
Well,
yeah,
it's,
I know I'd say no.
And first of all,

1415
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.930
that doesn't happen the closest,

1416
01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:09.290
the closest example I have to that happening was for me in Ramadi,

1417
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:15.170
we had been told that we had to take a certain number of Iraqi soldiers with us

1418
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:19.560
on every operation we conducted because we were trying to turn the war over to

1419
01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:22.950
them.
And so they needed to get out there.
And do operations,

1420
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:26.940
and they were telling us they were putting this,

1421
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.730
this rule all over every American unit and Iraq.

1422
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.340
You needed to have an Iraqi face on every operation.

1423
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:35.580
So what did the Americans do?
What did,
what did the American units do?

1424
01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:36.930
What they did was they say,
okay,
yeah,

1425
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:40.260
we're going to take our platoon of 40 guys and we're going to take to Iraqis

1426
01:22:40.261 --> 01:22:43.950
with us,
and there's your Iraqi face.
Well,
that doesn't move the wharf forward.

1427
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:47.490
They were obeying the rules.
So the,

1428
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:52.170
the senior leadership figured this out and said,
no,
you guys are playing games.

1429
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.860
Here's the new rule for every,
and I forget what the number was.

1430
01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:58.770
They made a ratio for every seven Americans that you have,

1431
01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:01.530
or for every one American,
you'd have to have,
you have,

1432
01:23:01.531 --> 01:23:04.140
you have to have seven Iraqi's are,
there were some numbers,
some ratio,

1433
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:06.220
and in Ramadi,

1434
01:23:06.221 --> 01:23:10.660
some of the units of Iraqis that we were working with only had 18 guys or 17

1435
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:11.440
guys.

1436
01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.730
And so that would have been me sending my guys in the field with two or three

1437
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:19.540
seals only,
which sending,
if you've got a,

1438
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.270
if you're going to go into a bad area and you're going to,

1439
01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:24.370
who are you going to send?
Because you want to have a radio man,

1440
01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.520
you want to have a medic,
you want to have a guy that can call for fires.

1441
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:30.820
You want to have a leader and you want to have a couple heavy heavy weapons
guys,

1442
01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.110
that's,
that's six or seven guys right there.
Minimum,
right?

1443
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:38.050
And so when the chain of command told me,
hey,
you got to do this ratio,

1444
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.330
I looked at the ratio and the,
and I said,
hey guys,
uh,
in Ramadi,
that's,

1445
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.670
that's not a good idea and here's why.

1446
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.290
I'm not going to send my guys in the field without a corpsman or without a radio

1447
01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:49.000
man,
without a Jay Tac or without a machine gunner.
I'm not,

1448
01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:53.950
I'm not going to do that.
And you know what they said?
They said,
that makes sense.

1449
01:23:53.951 --> 01:23:58.600
Chocolate,
you proceed.
Like if you articulate yourself correctly,

1450
01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:03.820
then you can get your point across.
Now head,
they said to me,
hey,

1451
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:06.100
listen,
no,
you're only allowed to do this.

1452
01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:09.340
Well then I would have objected further up the chain of command and I would not

1453
01:24:09.341 --> 01:24:12.640
have put my guys at risk to do something that didn't make sense.

1454
01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:15.910
I'm not going to do it.
Um,
and,
and again,

1455
01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:20.650
that's what I always encourage military people,
but not as military people,

1456
01:24:20.651 --> 01:24:21.340
business people.

1457
01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:26.340
If you're the CEO of a company and you've given some directive that you don't

1458
01:24:27.761 --> 01:24:32.460
understand the full depth of the directive that you've given and your front line

1459
01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:32.871
somebody,

1460
01:24:32.871 --> 01:24:36.040
somebody in your front lines realizes that's going to have a hugely negative

1461
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:38.710
impact on your company.
Do you want them just to follow orders?

1462
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:40.490
You absolutely don't want them to followers.

1463
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:43.210
You want them to raise their hand and say,
hey boss,
this doesn't make sense.

1464
01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.530
<v 2>And Athenia you said about,
yeah,</v>

1465
01:24:45.531 --> 01:24:49.340
you don't want to surround yourself with yes men,
which makes perfect sense.

1466
01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:50.570
Then again,
eats.

1467
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:55.190
It's one of the sinks where you really need to have work on yourself because the

1468
01:24:55.191 --> 01:24:59.690
reality is that most people have an ego.
Most people don't like to be told,

1469
01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.830
hey boss,
sorry about that doesn't sound right.
He's like,
well do you mean,

1470
01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.860
you know there's that reaction is like standing in their pride,

1471
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:10.520
which of course that were old bad decision making started going,

1472
01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.190
but he's a very normal reaction.
You know what I mean?

1473
01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:16.860
He's like most people have to one degree or another and ego and his speech.

1474
01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:20.510
A leaf like your guy maybe phrase it.
Maybe they are right,
right.

1475
01:25:20.511 --> 01:25:21.470
The makeup falling toward,

1476
01:25:21.471 --> 01:25:24.140
they are pointing to something in your plan and doesn't work.

1477
01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.470
But the phrase it in a way that's kind of blonde.
So a,

1478
01:25:27.471 --> 01:25:30.260
you don't like being watched.
The,

1479
01:25:30.261 --> 01:25:33.020
you don't like the tone by that point,

1480
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:35.780
even though their content is perfectly correct,

1481
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.170
you're not eating it because he's like,
you have a better,
I don't like you first.

1482
01:25:39.171 --> 01:25:41.690
They crazy size we can.
Then you are going about it with that tone.

1483
01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:46.130
The guy is just saying seeings plainly out they are.
Maybe it's not,

1484
01:25:46.131 --> 01:25:49.090
it doesn't have a bad tone is just not Cogley knew.

1485
01:25:49.091 --> 01:25:53.360
Wayne likes lowly Jane saying,
Hey,
let's see this way.

1486
01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:55.480
<v 0>And,
and you know what a guy in that,
cause I get the,</v>

1487
01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:58.030
I get that kind of question all the time with all the companies we work with.

1488
01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.320
I've got this guy and my,

1489
01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:02.080
my boss has a big ego and I can't correct him because he just,

1490
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:05.090
he just gets a fee.
Well first of all,
when you just like you said,

1491
01:26:05.091 --> 01:26:08.000
if you've got a big ego and I tell you that your plan is wrong,

1492
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:11.840
I'm attacking a four to five position and you're only going to bolster your

1493
01:26:11.841 --> 01:26:12.920
position stronger.

1494
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:17.660
And so don't attack that position instead of simple technique that you can use

1495
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:21.950
is say,
hey boss,
I'm really not sure why we're using this approach.

1496
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:22.761
Could you explain this to me?

1497
01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.280
Because I want to make sure that I really understand what it is you want me to

1498
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:27.140
do.
And it seems like if I do this right here,

1499
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:29.090
it's going to cause this reaction and I don't want,

1500
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.560
I know you don't want that to happen,

1501
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:33.890
so could you just give me a hand and fully understanding what your plan is?

1502
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:35.900
And that way you're,
you're,
you're,

1503
01:26:35.901 --> 01:26:39.530
you're kind of massaging their ego a little bit and it opens their mind and

1504
01:26:39.531 --> 01:26:41.000
that's all you have to do is open up their ears.

1505
01:26:41.001 --> 01:26:44.420
That's the goal is just to open their ears a little bit so that you can start to

1506
01:26:44.421 --> 01:26:47.840
have a conversation with them and so that they can get going back to the whole

1507
01:26:47.841 --> 01:26:50.800
topic of today so that they can see you as a human being with a,

1508
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:55.280
with an idea or an opinion that actually matters as opposed to seeing you as

1509
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:58.730
someone that's attacking their ego.
And that ego thing.
I mean,

1510
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.650
if you think about the wars that have been,
you know,

1511
01:27:00.651 --> 01:27:02.780
we always talk about the wars that are caused by religion,

1512
01:27:02.781 --> 01:27:06.020
but the wars that are caused by ego or are also pretty severe.

1513
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:10.400
And a lot of these incidents that we talk about,
these retaliatory incidences,

1514
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:12.620
well,
who's going to be the first person to say,

1515
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:17.060
you attacked my tribe and I'm going to let it slide.

1516
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:22.010
But that's,
that's,
that's a tough person.
That's a hard position to be in.

1517
01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.560
You're seen as weak.
You're seen as you,
you know,
vulnerable.

1518
01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:28.340
You're seen as someone that can be pushed around.
So there's,

1519
01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:33.341
that's a very delicate game that you have to play and that causes problems in

1520
01:27:33.911 --> 01:27:37.610
that that ends up,
that's a game that's so hard to play.
In fact that most people,

1521
01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:42.140
or many people across the span of time have said,
no,

1522
01:27:42.141 --> 01:27:46.340
I'm not going to say that they did.
They drew blood.
We're going to draw more.

1523
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.470
Yeah.

1524
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:47.580
<v 1>Blood.
Yup.
And it</v>

1525
01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.490
goes to what you were saying a second ago to your people have to know that

1526
01:27:53.491 --> 01:27:56.190
you're going to ask those questions of your leadership and that you're doing

1527
01:27:56.490 --> 01:27:58.950
that work because they got to trust you.
You know,

1528
01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:01.410
that way when Jocko comes to him and says,
hey guys,

1529
01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:04.260
I know this is going to sound a little bit weird,

1530
01:28:04.261 --> 01:28:07.260
but here's what we're doing and here's who you're bringing with you and this is

1531
01:28:07.261 --> 01:28:11.070
what we're doing.
They know that if you're telling them to do it,

1532
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:12.960
it's gotta be done.

1533
01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:17.760
That every discussion has been had that every angle has been looked at,

1534
01:28:17.761 --> 01:28:21.390
that you've run it up the chain of command and registered your objections if

1535
01:28:21.391 --> 01:28:22.170
they're there,

1536
01:28:22.170 --> 01:28:26.130
but they know that Jocko is not going to send us out to do something like this

1537
01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.290
unless it simply has to be done.

1538
01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.850
<v 0>And I get asked this question a lot,
well,</v>

1539
01:28:32.851 --> 01:28:37.851
what do I do if one of my subordinates has a question about the way I've planned

1540
01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:42.840
something and I don't have a good answer?
What do I do?
Then I say,
well,

1541
01:28:42.841 --> 01:28:45.060
what you do then is you listen to them.

1542
01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:48.090
You actually listened to what they're saying because if,
if,

1543
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:53.240
if I've told you to do something and you've then responded with some reason why

1544
01:28:53.941 --> 01:28:57.780
we shouldn't do that thing and I can't explain away your reason,

1545
01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.870
then probably I'm wrong.
And and as a leader,

1546
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:05.100
this is another thing where our ego plays a role as a leader.
Our Ego says,
well,

1547
01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:07.260
if I admit that I'm wrong to the troops,

1548
01:29:07.261 --> 01:29:09.060
they're going to think I'm up there going to think I don't know what I'm doing.

1549
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.770
The opposite is actually true.

1550
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.340
If I was in charge of youtube and I presented you with a plan and you guys came

1551
01:29:14.341 --> 01:29:17.130
back and today that plan's not smart and I said,

1552
01:29:17.131 --> 01:29:20.820
shut up and do it the way I told you you don't respect me more.

1553
01:29:20.850 --> 01:29:22.410
You respect me less.

1554
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.670
And if if I came to you two with a plan and said,
hey guys,

1555
01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.350
here's the way we're going to execute this.
And you say,
Hey,

1556
01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:31.680
that's not a good idea.
We should do it a different way.
And I say,
okay,

1557
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:34.680
well what do you recommend?
And we come together with a collaborative plan.

1558
01:29:34.681 --> 01:29:36.690
You don't think less of me as a leader.
As a matter of fact,

1559
01:29:36.691 --> 01:29:37.860
you think more of me as a leader,

1560
01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:41.310
you think that I'm a humble guy that will listen and take input.
And by the way,

1561
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:42.183
bonuses,

1562
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:46.440
you all now have real true ownership of the plan and we all feel good about it.

1563
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:47.850
And when you guys go on the field,

1564
01:29:47.851 --> 01:29:51.960
you execute it to the utmost of your ability because it's something that you
own.

1565
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:55.320
<v 1>It's amazing how everything you're saying is,</v>

1566
01:29:55.380 --> 01:30:00.380
it's as if you took a list of all the traits of Lieutenant Calley at me lie and

1567
01:30:00.391 --> 01:30:03.030
literally just said,
do the opposite of all these things.

1568
01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:07.350
He was a guy who couldn't take criticism from his men,
100% who asserted a,

1569
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:11.160
you know,
who,
who pulled rank anytime anything like that happened.
Uh,

1570
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:16.220
who was a complete transparent yes man to his captain above him who was just

1571
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:20.580
never ask any questions.
I mean,
just right down the line.
And as a result,

1572
01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:24.480
his men had no trust in him so that when they got into a situation that was

1573
01:30:24.481 --> 01:30:24.960
chaotic,

1574
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.130
they felt like they were standing out on the corner by themselves in a country

1575
01:30:29.131 --> 01:30:31.290
they didn't understand with nobody looking out for them.

1576
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:35.220
I don't want to say this in a way that makes it sound like I'm trying to justify

1577
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:36.360
anything they did,
of course not.

1578
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:41.660
But you put men in a situation where they feel like they're in complete chaos

1579
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:46.620
and they happen to have automatic weapons in their hands.
Well,

1580
01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.220
if I find myself in a situation where I'm completely overwhelmed by chaos,

1581
01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:53.280
that automatic weapons probably going to start to look like the best tool I have

1582
01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.450
for structuring my environment.

1583
01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:58.690
<v 0>Yeah,
there's a,
and,
and obviously this went way beyond that.
The,
uh,
years ago,</v>

1584
01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:02.070
I forget how many years ago there was a shooting in New York City,
uh,

1585
01:31:02.110 --> 01:31:05.590
I think it was 38 rounds were fired at uh,

1586
01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:09.640
maybe a homeless person and unarmed person.
I forget the situation,

1587
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:13.630
but there's a lot of people that just couldn't believe that all these,

1588
01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:19.120
all these police officers shot at this unarmed individual,

1589
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:23.680
horrible situation.
And again,
I always have always will say this,

1590
01:31:23.730 --> 01:31:28.390
like whenever I talk about bad police shootings,
I been on ride alongs with cops.

1591
01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:32.500
I've done hits with cops.
It's a freaking hard job.
And,

1592
01:31:32.630 --> 01:31:35.620
and I'm not a guy that like,
I've done that a couple times here and there,

1593
01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:39.250
but go out on that beat every day and deal with those scumbags of the world

1594
01:31:39.251 --> 01:31:43.420
every single day.
And you're going to have,
it's going to be,
it's the freedom.

1595
01:31:43.450 --> 01:31:46.450
It's one of the hardest jobs in the world.
That situation people to,

1596
01:31:46.451 --> 01:31:50.080
how the hell did that happen?
Well there's,

1597
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:54.670
there's a lot of tension in a situation that emotions are high,

1598
01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:56.680
people are screaming,
we're not trained well.

1599
01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.550
Everyone is sitting there with their slack out the trigger and when that first

1600
01:32:00.551 --> 01:32:03.790
bang happens,
it's a,
it's a chain reaction.
That's one of,

1601
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:06.400
one of the situations that,
you know,

1602
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:10.870
I would see with my guys that was beautiful in Ramadi was they wouldn't do that

1603
01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.170
if,
if one of the snipers took a pointed shot at someone,

1604
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:17.170
they would take the point of shot and the others would hold fire,

1605
01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:22.030
check fire until,
you know,
the,
the situation either evolved or,
or deescalated.

1606
01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.890
But the,

1607
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:29.080
the army was always quite impressed with the fact that we would take really

1608
01:32:29.081 --> 01:32:32.480
surgical shots at bad guys and there wouldn't be,
you know,

1609
01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:38.260
massive amounts of collateral damage.
Um,
again,
sometimes it's unavoidable,
but

1610
01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:40.250
<v 1>maybe you can talk a little bit about that.</v>

1611
01:32:40.251 --> 01:32:44.210
Cause I think that's one thing that gets really lost on a lot of people saying.

1612
01:32:44.211 --> 01:32:47.210
I think there's a lot of propaganda that helps it get lost.
You know,

1613
01:32:47.211 --> 01:32:51.040
there's no question that there's been an evolution and,
um,

1614
01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:54.870
our values and our relationship to these kinds of things over the years.

1615
01:32:54.871 --> 01:32:59.050
So you go back to something like San Creek,
1864,
uh,

1616
01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:02.810
there might not have been a whole lot of people shedding too many tears over

1617
01:33:02.811 --> 01:33:06.350
what happened.
You get up to me lie and you know,

1618
01:33:06.351 --> 01:33:10.040
there's some controversy and there's some,
you know,
there's a cover up,

1619
01:33:10.041 --> 01:33:11.000
all those kinds of things,

1620
01:33:11.001 --> 01:33:15.410
but once it comes out and it's laid bare and the evidence is clear,

1621
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:19.960
things had changed from 1864,
and that,
that incident and a few,
you know,

1622
01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:22.130
other incidents that were going on,
it made it out.

1623
01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:24.980
Or a few pictures that came out,
it turned people against the war.

1624
01:33:24.981 --> 01:33:29.710
They decided that this is not worth putting our men in a situation where we're

1625
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:33.650
going to be doing things like this.
This is not worth it.
And you get up to today,

1626
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:38.600
uh,
in the Iraq war,
something like Abu Ghraib,
which is an unacceptable situation,

1627
01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:43.700
but we're talking about prisoner abuse.
That doesn't,

1628
01:33:43.701 --> 01:33:44.480
uh,

1629
01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:49.480
th th that wouldn't cause the people who were working that prison five years

1630
01:33:49.671 --> 01:33:54.230
before that the Iraqis who worked for [inaudible] that wouldn't even,

1631
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:58.850
you know,
they,
they wouldn't even make it through their filter.
Right.
So,
I mean,

1632
01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:02.450
what,
what was going on there with the American soldiers,
it was,
it was not okay,

1633
01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.190
but it wasn't walking into a village and mastering 500 people.
It wasn't,

1634
01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:09.023
uh,
you know,

1635
01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.150
brutal torture in the same way that we would think of what was going on before

1636
01:34:14.151 --> 01:34:15.470
we took control of that prison.

1637
01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:20.480
And yet our response to that in the military's response to it once it came out

1638
01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:24.950
was pretty dramatic.
I mean,
it was theirs and it was quick.
It didn't,

1639
01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.590
there was not as much of a delay as soon as it comes out.
There's,

1640
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:30.110
so there's a clear shift that's going on there.
If,

1641
01:34:30.210 --> 01:34:34.250
if even primarily from the standpoint of it's just,
it's a breach and discipline,

1642
01:34:34.251 --> 01:34:35.570
that's not how you behave.

1643
01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:36.851
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
and,</v>

1644
01:34:36.851 --> 01:34:41.851
and one of the things that I'd talk about with my guys is because you got to

1645
01:34:41.921 --> 01:34:44.820
frame this right because you know,

1646
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:48.820
you mentioned earlier that if you had to dealt with this person that had cut the

1647
01:34:48.821 --> 01:34:51.550
heads off of the three year old girl yesterday and now you,

1648
01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:56.140
you had him cuffed and you knew it was him,
that guy deserves a bullet,
right?
I,

1649
01:34:56.210 --> 01:35:00.590
Hey,
I agree with you.
That guy deserves a bullet.
The,
the problem is,

1650
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:03.740
well number one,
it's a breakdown in discipline,

1651
01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:08.800
but to me more important and what I would tell my guys is if we behave that way,

1652
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:16.330
we have a significant chance of strategically negatively impacting our war

1653
01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:21.740
effort.
So I get that you want to kill these bad guys,

1654
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:25.700
but more important than us killing these bad guys is us in winning this war.

1655
01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:28.340
And so if we run around doing dumb things,

1656
01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:30.560
we're going to have a negative strategic impact on the,

1657
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:35.090
and that was actually always the biggest worry as a leader is you don't want to

1658
01:35:35.091 --> 01:35:38.080
have some,
something happened where you know,
you,

1659
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.480
you drop a bomb on the wrong area or you know,

1660
01:35:41.481 --> 01:35:43.790
in a bunch of civilians get killed or you know,
you,

1661
01:35:43.791 --> 01:35:45.770
you don't want to have that thing happen.
That's a real,

1662
01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:51.700
and the effort and lengths that American forces go to to prevent civilian

1663
01:35:52.341 --> 01:35:56.540
casualties is,
it's incredible.
I don't think most people have any idea.
No,

1664
01:35:56.541 --> 01:35:57.680
they don't.
They don't works.

1665
01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.200
<v 2>And I think that's why we're the coolest things about creatine ascertain</v>

1666
01:36:01.290 --> 01:36:04.930
mythology that people would want to live up to the first time you say it,

1667
01:36:04.931 --> 01:36:05.764
he may not be through,

1668
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:09.880
he may be a wishful thinking that you hired those people and you're not quite

1669
01:36:09.881 --> 01:36:14.190
there.
But as people keep repeating eighth and your aunt again and again,
we'd,

1670
01:36:14.191 --> 01:36:17.980
the fact that your behavior doesn't match your ideas more and more people we

1671
01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:20.170
keep working on trying to actually build that thing.

1672
01:36:20.171 --> 01:36:22.030
They don't want to feel that like hypocrites.

1673
01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:24.370
They actually want to live up to that idea.

1674
01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:29.850
And that's one of the sinks were why is sometimes people get turned off by when

1675
01:36:29.921 --> 01:36:33.640
you have these high minded id I'll and this very poor behavior.
Or they're like,

1676
01:36:33.641 --> 01:36:35.010
oh look at that Hippocrates,
they,

1677
01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.920
Sadie's seeing Sunday Dominico well sometime when you say it long enough,

1678
01:36:38.921 --> 01:36:42.160
people actually do want to live up to it and they do change their behavior.

1679
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:45.640
So while the theory may not match the practice,
when you start,

1680
01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:47.620
if you keep at it long enough,

1681
01:36:47.650 --> 01:36:51.850
the practice may try to inch closer to mention that theory ideals.

1682
01:36:51.851 --> 01:36:55.340
And that's not a bad thing.
Yeah.
I mean,
I,
I,
you can take it

1683
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:58.730
<v 1>to,
uh,
uh,
political context,
right.</v>

1684
01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:03.731
When people can point back at the United States say before the 1960s and before

1685
01:37:03.771 --> 01:37:07.130
the civil war and point to the Constitution and declaration of independence in

1686
01:37:07.131 --> 01:37:11.570
these high minded ideas,
and people love to be the cynical one that says,
oh yeah,

1687
01:37:11.571 --> 01:37:16.220
yeah,
yeah,
but slavery and of course,
but this and,
but that,
and yeah,
totally,

1688
01:37:16.221 --> 01:37:18.620
totally true.
But the,
the,

1689
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.070
the conclusion to draw from that is not that,
uh,

1690
01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.060
the ideals don't matter or that they're just on paper.

1691
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:30.350
The fact that those ideals were there was what allowed the civil rights movement

1692
01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:34.710
to eventually apps come into being.
That's what,
you know,
gave us the room.

1693
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:38.570
In fact,
you could even say that the thing we're talking about,
the same thing,
uh,

1694
01:37:38.571 --> 01:37:41.480
that gap between ideal and reality.

1695
01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.980
One Way to talk about that is hypocrisy.
But at the same time,
that gap,

1696
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:47.600
that opening is,

1697
01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.220
that's the opening where people realize that and say there is a gap between our

1698
01:37:52.221 --> 01:37:56.670
professed ideals and,
and it makes room for that of positive change.
Right?
I mean,

1699
01:37:56.671 --> 01:37:58.830
you can go back,
uh,
there was,

1700
01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:03.890
the Mongols were never ever going to give up slavery because their moral system

1701
01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:09.000
didn't have room for that.
Yeah.
And so if you could go up to them and say,
well,

1702
01:38:09.001 --> 01:38:13.050
how dare you enslave these people and they're not going to get defensive,

1703
01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.890
they're going to look at you like you're crazy because there's no room for that,

1704
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:21.180
you know,
for that gap,
that idea doesn't even exist.
Right.
Right?

1705
01:38:21.181 --> 01:38:25.230
And so the ideal is matter.
And when,
uh,
when,
when they're broken,
um,
you know,

1706
01:38:25.231 --> 01:38:25.800
again,

1707
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:30.330
I think that there's a motivation on the part of a lot of people who are,

1708
01:38:30.331 --> 01:38:31.950
who were more cynical than they should be,

1709
01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:37.230
a given the country that they're fortunate enough to live in.
You know,
um,

1710
01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:41.220
this is something that you get from going overseas to a lot of places.

1711
01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:44.060
It's something certainly that I got from spending so much time in Africa,

1712
01:38:44.061 --> 01:38:46.500
in the Middle East for work is boy,

1713
01:38:46.501 --> 01:38:50.940
you come back after the first trip to over to those places and you realize you

1714
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:54.090
want to kiss the ground when you get off that airplane and you want to go around

1715
01:38:54.091 --> 01:38:56.160
and just hug everybody.
You see,

1716
01:38:56.250 --> 01:39:00.600
because you are so fortunate to live in a place where things that we absolutely

1717
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:05.530
take for granted over here are miracles.
And,
um,
you know,
I,

1718
01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:10.190
I think,
uh,
one of the things I did really didn't want to do,
um,

1719
01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:13.320
when I was talking about me lying that episode,
um,

1720
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:18.870
I stayed very focused on the,
uh,
the incident itself,
sort of.

1721
01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:23.700
Um,
because I,
you don't want to,

1722
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:27.100
you don't want to be making excuses for something like that and you don't want

1723
01:39:27.101 --> 01:39:31.980
to make it seem like you're trying to go look gloss over and atrocity.
Um,

1724
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:33.263
but,

1725
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:41.040
but you don't want to,
uh,
give fuel to that idea that like this is,

1726
01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:45.270
this speaks to like a larger problem in our society because I just don't believe

1727
01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:46.080
that it's

1728
01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:46.980
<v 2>a dance,
right?</v>

1729
01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:51.390
If you start pushing the button too much in the direction of making apologies

1730
01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:55.790
for where laughter,
all we are good guys and there are a few exceptions by Luke.

1731
01:39:55.830 --> 01:40:00.120
We are,
we stand for freedom and democracy.
He's like,
yeah,
maybe,

1732
01:40:00.121 --> 01:40:04.290
but let's not be so quick about sweeping under the rug.
All the bad stuff.

1733
01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:07.980
Let's look at it.
The guys,
we instead push on the button of,
Hey,

1734
01:40:07.981 --> 01:40:09.150
look at all the bad stuff.

1735
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.800
That means that all these ideas are crap and it's not real and it's solely

1736
01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:15.750
Parker's.
He's like,
Whoa,
slow down on a second.
Yeah,

1737
01:40:15.751 --> 01:40:19.200
you've got a couple of points where you are right by are also missing the boat.

1738
01:40:19.201 --> 01:40:22.230
It's like,
it's almost like,
and that happens in most discussion,

1739
01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:26.550
like in most situations,
you rarely have somebody with 100% wrong,

1740
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.990
is that they take a partial truths and they take it too far and they lose

1741
01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:33.150
perspective of the other side of the equation.

1742
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:38.160
People don't understand like American soldiers were killed and maimed,
uh,

1743
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:43.310
in situations that absolutely could have been avoided if we disregarded our

1744
01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.930
rules of engagement.
And if we made,
like,

1745
01:40:45.931 --> 01:40:49.980
we made conscious decisions to put ourselves at risk when we did not have to

1746
01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:52.890
because we were trying to be sensitive to the environment and to the people that

1747
01:40:52.891 --> 01:40:53.724
were.

1748
01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:58.840
And I don't think enough people recognize the historical anomaly that that is.

1749
01:40:58.930 --> 01:41:00.730
I mean,
that is just a,
you can't,

1750
01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:06.130
for thousands of years of human history that is just completely unthinkable.

1751
01:41:06.401 --> 01:41:09.580
You couldn't imagine something like that.
And the extent to which we go,

1752
01:41:09.581 --> 01:41:11.650
I mean Jocko has talked about this before on his show,

1753
01:41:11.651 --> 01:41:15.400
the extent to which we go to try to make sure that the people,
you know,

1754
01:41:15.401 --> 01:41:19.450
the targets that we're,
that we're dealing with our targets.
Um,

1755
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.840
I think if more civilians had,
uh,
had,
uh,

1756
01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.680
an idea of that people would feel a lot different about,

1757
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:28.390
about what we do over there.
You know,

1758
01:41:28.391 --> 01:41:31.180
it doesn't mean that when something happens like ob of grave,

1759
01:41:31.181 --> 01:41:33.610
they're not going to react against that,

1760
01:41:33.611 --> 01:41:37.390
but they're going to react against it from a place of,
hey,
we're,

1761
01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.370
we're a good country.
That shit is not going to fly.
All right?
That's not what,

1762
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:44.950
you're not going to represent us that way.
And that's fine.

1763
01:41:44.951 --> 01:41:49.510
That's a healthy way to respond to something like that.
Um,
but you know,

1764
01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:53.060
again,
it was a political situation or whatever else is going on.
Like,
you know,

1765
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.810
people have more of a knee jerk reaction to those things that you're talking

1766
01:41:55.811 --> 01:41:58.710
about it,
so you can get that sense.
It goes back to that,
uh,

1767
01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.600
Dan Carlin approach to saying so,
right?

1768
01:42:00.610 --> 01:42:04.690
That ability to look at sinks one way and just when you're getting comfortable

1769
01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:08.950
with Dako inclusions to say,
yes,
maybe that is the conclusion we take,

1770
01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:12.790
but it's not that easy.
There's also a 20% from the other side.

1771
01:42:12.791 --> 01:42:15.950
It's not really wrong.
Then you food including that and,

1772
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:19.000
and that keeps you thinking on your toes.
You don't become dogmatic.

1773
01:42:19.001 --> 01:42:21.580
You don't become thinking purely black and white terms.

1774
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:26.440
You all the way staff to have that nuance approach,
which,
and that's the problem.

1775
01:42:26.441 --> 01:42:27.550
That's the other pirate jokes.
He's,

1776
01:42:27.551 --> 01:42:29.770
most people have take an alliance to mean weakness,

1777
01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:32.950
then you can't make up your mind.
You are too wishy washy.

1778
01:42:32.951 --> 01:42:34.870
You are is not black.

1779
01:42:34.871 --> 01:42:38.020
He an off why two somewhere in there is like mill.

1780
01:42:38.050 --> 01:42:43.050
That's also a weakness is the ability to look at things both ways and also make

1781
01:42:43.241 --> 01:42:47.440
a decision that's where can we can seen as when it's available.

1782
01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.160
And I think he's funny because so many of the things that joker brings up are so

1783
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:56.020
about really the kind of human being that you want to become.

1784
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.530
You know about self perfection really.
Cause that's what it boils down to,

1785
01:42:59.531 --> 01:43:00.131
which is Dan,

1786
01:43:00.131 --> 01:43:02.860
what makes you a great leader because there's no good athlete or without

1787
01:43:02.861 --> 01:43:06.820
somebody was working on themselves a lot and you know when you better get down

1788
01:43:06.821 --> 01:43:10.590
to depending suppose nothing sounds like it's that hard,
right?
He's all like,

1789
01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:12.360
okay,
of course.
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1790
01:43:12.361 --> 01:43:16.090
So that completely and yet it's one of the Sikhs were,

1791
01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:20.320
while the theory may not be that hard,
the practices and the Atlanta team,

1792
01:43:20.321 --> 01:43:24.430
you have to be at it every single day or it's so easy.
It was leap.
There's,

1793
01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:27.600
there's a great line,
I need to doubt a change that I was bad,

1794
01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:29.660
surely to their road we're driving down.
There's,

1795
01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.160
there's the line at say may way is very easy to understand and very easy to

1796
01:43:35.531 --> 01:43:38.170
practice,
but nobody understand it at nobody trap.

1797
01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:42.640
And I love it because in tod,
yes,
it's not that bad.

1798
01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:47.680
It's fairly straightforward and yet there are so many steps along the way where

1799
01:43:47.681 --> 01:43:52.220
it's easy to go their own path that is like,
yeah,
the theory is easy.

1800
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:53.320
<v 1>The practice cs,</v>

1801
01:43:53.370 --> 01:43:57.110
you need to put in the work that each of those steps matters so much to,

1802
01:43:57.111 --> 01:44:02.080
because you know,
Jocko was talking about escalation in those situations.
The um,

1803
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:04.760
the book about the war in Chechnya,
you talked about,
I think the line,

1804
01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.720
I hadn't read the book until I heard your podcast on it and it just,

1805
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:11.540
it's one of those things that when you hear it,
it's so obvious.

1806
01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.720
But if you were to just step back from the context,

1807
01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:18.770
a little bit kind of seems ridiculous is which is that the savagery started when

1808
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:21.710
people stop shaving,
when soldiers stopped shaving.

1809
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:26.350
And I think part of the reason for something like that is,
uh,
once it is,

1810
01:44:26.351 --> 01:44:30.290
it's like the escalation.
It's like a ratchet.
Once you stopped shaving,

1811
01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.820
well now you're a unit that doesn't shave anymore.
Okay,
whatever.
Well,

1812
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:37.520
what that means is if you're a unit that lacks discipline,

1813
01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.840
well now your lack of discipline is not going to manifest,
is not shaving.

1814
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.930
You already don't shave.
That's normal.
That's totally normal.

1815
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:48.560
So now your lack of discipline is going to get to the next thing.

1816
01:44:48.561 --> 01:44:51.020
Now I'm not cleaning my weapons properly.

1817
01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:54.020
And then pretty soon you're a unit that doesn't shave and doesn't clean your

1818
01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:56.990
weapons properly.
And that doesn't even seem like a lack of discipline anymore.

1819
01:44:57.020 --> 01:45:00.560
That just seems like daily life and now your lack of discipline or whatever it

1820
01:45:00.561 --> 01:45:03.680
is,
it's going to go up to the next spot and it can happen with,
you know,

1821
01:45:03.681 --> 01:45:07.190
it can happen with just brutality and savagery and things like that as well.

1822
01:45:07.191 --> 01:45:11.690
We're now,
this kind of thing is just normal.
So if I'm angry,
uh,

1823
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:15.950
and it's totally normal for us to be able to smack these prisoners in the face,

1824
01:45:15.951 --> 01:45:18.680
but now I'm really pissed I'm not going to smack them in the face.

1825
01:45:18.681 --> 01:45:20.750
I smack them in the face anyway,
you know?

1826
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:25.640
So I'm going to show my anger now by stepping it up and man,
well,
okay,
if that's,

1827
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:29.720
if that slides and the leadership doesn't step in,
well now that's normal.

1828
01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:31.850
You know,
we're,
you know,
we don't just smack soldiers,

1829
01:45:31.851 --> 01:45:35.720
we punched and kicked soldiers that once,
that's the baseline,

1830
01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:37.470
it ratchets up to that point.
Well,

1831
01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.760
it's going to escalate from there because you know,
that's kind of where it goes.

1832
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.630
And that's why catching those things right at the beginning and letting people

1833
01:45:44.631 --> 01:45:47.150
know that,
you know,
all of these things matter.

1834
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:49.910
I mean that's probably the life lesson.

1835
01:45:49.911 --> 01:45:53.510
A lot of the stuff you even talk about it,
everything matters.
It all matters.

1836
01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:57.710
<v 0>Yeah.
And not,
it takes some time.
Like I didn't,</v>

1837
01:45:57.810 --> 01:46:02.810
I didn't realize this when I was a 20 year old seal or a 25 year olds seal.

1838
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:08.630
You know,
I kind of started getting the indications and,
and that's why again,

1839
01:46:08.631 --> 01:46:12.650
you know,
I talk about training and leadership because that's what this stuff is,

1840
01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:16.250
you know,
putting somebody into a moral dilemma

1841
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:22.520
with no training is like putting someone onto the Jujitsu Mat with no training.

1842
01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:24.200
They're just going to get destroyed.

1843
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:26.990
Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen and they have no control over it.

1844
01:46:27.650 --> 01:46:31.280
And you know,
you got to think about these things.

1845
01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:36.380
You've got to think deeply about these things so that you have some sort of an

1846
01:46:36.381 --> 01:46:38.510
anchor that's grounded,

1847
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:41.990
that won't get ripped out at the first person that says,
hey shoot,

1848
01:46:41.991 --> 01:46:45.200
that three year old baby you want,

1849
01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:49.710
you need to be grounded and have thought about these things in a deeper way.
And,

1850
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:55.310
and you know what you said about people swaying one way or the other.

1851
01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:03.020
You're right and people actually want to be led and they want to be led even

1852
01:47:05.071 --> 01:47:09.360
more.
So when there is a pressure situation going on,

1853
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.580
when there's something that you're not used to or that people aren't used to,

1854
01:47:14.670 --> 01:47:17.910
some kind of structure,
some kind of stress or pressure,

1855
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:23.160
if you can step up and lead at that moment,
people are looking for,

1856
01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:25.270
they're looking for a leader and that was it.

1857
01:47:25.271 --> 01:47:28.830
I remember you were talking about one of the guys and be lie the six foot three

1858
01:47:28.831 --> 01:47:31.080
guy and he's a natural leader,
right?

1859
01:47:31.110 --> 01:47:34.170
He's a natural leader that people kind of followed in what he started going

1860
01:47:34.171 --> 01:47:39.060
sideways and it started just getting completely savage and brutal people just

1861
01:47:39.061 --> 01:47:42.240
kind of,
okay,
you know,
he's the guy,
you know,
like,
okay,

1862
01:47:42.241 --> 01:47:45.110
that guy's stepping up and,
and that's,
and,

1863
01:47:45.111 --> 01:47:49.440
and there was no one on the other end of the spectrum to say,
Hey,
no,

1864
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.060
we're not doing that.
Stop.

1865
01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:55.260
And that's the biggest lesson from that situation actually from both the

1866
01:47:55.261 --> 01:47:58.230
situations.
And,
you know,
you know,

1867
01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:01.710
people talk about is how can the leader be responsible if they're not there?

1868
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:06.540
You know?
Yes.
The leader's responsible,
whether they're,
the way they trained,

1869
01:48:06.541 --> 01:48:08.340
the people,
the way they educated,
the way they communicated,

1870
01:48:08.341 --> 01:48:11.190
the culture that they sat with those people,
they're responsible.

1871
01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:14.400
And certainly these leaders were absolutely responsible in these scenarios.

1872
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:18.660
<v 2>I guess before we are out,
one last thing I want to ask you is these days,
um,</v>

1873
01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:21.830
you say you work a lot with businesses.
You clearly are,
you know,

1874
01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:26.190
you're working primarily on the concept of leadership and out teach people a

1875
01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:30.560
better tools to handle it.
How do you go about it?
What's your,

1876
01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:31.440
what's easy?

1877
01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:35.540
But I'm already like in business oriented approach now with major businesses

1878
01:48:35.541 --> 01:48:36.374
that are,

1879
01:48:36.730 --> 01:48:36.911
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1880
01:48:36.911 --> 01:48:41.530
we'll go in and do an assessment and figure out where the friction points are.

1881
01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:45.450
Figure out where they're having problems and,

1882
01:48:45.451 --> 01:48:47.800
and then we solve the problems that they're having through leadership.

1883
01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:52.940
And that's every single problem in every single organization is a leadership

1884
01:48:54.131 --> 01:48:58.600
problem.
All of them,
whether it's your P and L's upside down,

1885
01:48:58.601 --> 01:49:00.700
whether it's your processes aren't,
aren't working correctly,

1886
01:49:00.701 --> 01:49:02.560
whether you've got the wrong people in the wrong positions,

1887
01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:07.810
it doesn't matter what the problems are going to get solved through leadership

1888
01:49:07.811 --> 01:49:10.090
and leadership alone.
And that's why we,

1889
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:14.440
that's why we're doing well because if you've got a,
if you've got a p and l,

1890
01:49:14.441 --> 01:49:15.071
it's upside down.

1891
01:49:15.071 --> 01:49:18.400
You've got leaders that aren't paying attention to their expenditures and their

1892
01:49:18.401 --> 01:49:21.520
income,
right?
If you've got processes that aren't working,

1893
01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:24.640
you've got leaders that are in charge of those processes that are allowing them

1894
01:49:24.641 --> 01:49:27.310
to continue to exist without refinement.

1895
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.270
If you've got people that are in positions that shouldn't be in those positions,

1896
01:49:31.271 --> 01:49:34.660
you've got leaders that are allowing them to be in those positions without

1897
01:49:34.661 --> 01:49:38.410
either being coached and mentored and trained so that they can lead or removed

1898
01:49:38.411 --> 01:49:42.400
from those positions and you can go right down the list with any problem that

1899
01:49:42.401 --> 01:49:43.690
any organization is having.

1900
01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:48.040
There's a leadership solution to that problem and that's what we

1901
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:48.550
<v 1>do.</v>

1902
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:52.720
It seems to me like as definitely the thing I'm going to take away from the most

1903
01:49:52.721 --> 01:49:55.840
and listen you talk about this stuff is one of the things that struck me as I

1904
01:49:55.841 --> 01:49:57.970
came in with a lot of questions in mind.

1905
01:49:57.971 --> 01:50:01.020
I wanted to talk to you about like that I started out with,
right you,

1906
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.870
you've got your guys,

1907
01:50:01.871 --> 01:50:04.990
you're going into a horrible situation and there's these horrible things going

1908
01:50:04.991 --> 01:50:05.111
on.

1909
01:50:05.111 --> 01:50:09.790
How do you restrain your guys from going and retaliating in these terrible ways

1910
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:12.640
and your response and the look on your face and everything to it?

1911
01:50:12.670 --> 01:50:15.240
It actually like kind of threw me off a little bit.
It wasn't what I,

1912
01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:19.450
what I was expecting because your,
your answer to that really was,
dude,

1913
01:50:19.451 --> 01:50:23.670
if I have gotten to the point where we're there in Iraq and there was a guy with

1914
01:50:23.690 --> 01:50:27.250
handcuffs and I have to figure out how to restrain my guys from doing something

1915
01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:32.410
I failed a long time ago.
You cause you took it as almost like Ah,
well you know,

1916
01:50:32.411 --> 01:50:35.320
you deal with it.
That was taken care of.
We,
how do we stop them?

1917
01:50:35.530 --> 01:50:38.590
We stopped him in training,
we stopped at in bootcamp,
we stopped to make buds.

1918
01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.540
We stopped them in turn all the way up to here.

1919
01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:43.650
<v 0>And I don't want to make that,
I don't want to,
I don't want to make that,</v>

1920
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:48.120
I don't want to make light of that cause that,
that is a hard situation.

1921
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:53.510
And when you lose guys in a unit of 35 guys and you got guys that are wounded

1922
01:50:54.211 --> 01:50:57.920
and killed,
there is absolutely,
uh,

1923
01:50:59.670 --> 01:51:04.670
there is an absolute fire that you have to control because we know who's doing

1924
01:51:09.481 --> 01:51:13.350
it.
We can find them,
we can get out there and get and get after them.

1925
01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:17.430
And so we,
we do have to keep ourselves in check.
We do,

1926
01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:22.410
I mean we had many conversations of hey,
remember why we're here.

1927
01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:27.150
Remember who we represent.
Remember that if we get out of line,

1928
01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:30.180
we won't even be allowed to do what we do anymore.
Oh,
so,

1929
01:51:30.181 --> 01:51:35.070
so don't take it the wrong way.
That in any unit,
any unit,

1930
01:51:35.670 --> 01:51:39.330
you lose people,
you lose your friends,
you lose your brothers.

1931
01:51:39.810 --> 01:51:41.550
That is an emotional,

1932
01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:47.700
it's an emotional thing and you're in an emotional situation already and you

1933
01:51:47.701 --> 01:51:48.960
have access,

1934
01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:54.020
direct access to unleash your emotions if you are allowed to.

1935
01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:59.410
And Yeah,
the,
you know,

1936
01:51:59.450 --> 01:52:03.210
with the platoon commanders that worked for me with,
I mean those guys,
you know,

1937
01:52:03.211 --> 01:52:06.590
Lafe who wrote the book with me,
I mean he absolutely had to,

1938
01:52:06.690 --> 01:52:11.490
had to sit as guys down and explained to them,
hey,
let's remember why we're here.

1939
01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:16.820
Let's remember that we could go to jail if we do the wrong thing.

1940
01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:20.970
And nothing that we do here is worth any of you are going to jail for any amount

1941
01:52:20.971 --> 01:52:25.290
of time.
So I didn't mean to make light of how hard that is.

1942
01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:30.510
And,
and how difficult that can be.
And,
and it's not just for me,

1943
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:33.480
not just for the seals,
but you know,

1944
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:36.270
the marines just soldiers that were there who are dealing with,
like I said,

1945
01:52:36.271 --> 01:52:40.230
they're doing with younger kids and,
and uh,
less with less training.

1946
01:52:40.890 --> 01:52:43.230
And you know,
those,
when you come in the seal teams,

1947
01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:44.880
you came in because he wanted to go to combat.

1948
01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:49.550
Like every single CEO wants to go to combat.
They want to be there.

1949
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:52.630
I don't know if you've ever heard my retirement speech.
It's,
it's,

1950
01:52:52.730 --> 01:52:57.440
it's on youtube.
But when like I made a list and said,
hey,

1951
01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:02.060
if you want to go over to the eastern part of Ramadi and live in,
uh,
in,
uh,

1952
01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:06.860
blown out bunker and get into firefights every day,
put your name on this list.

1953
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:07.850
And I walked out of the room,

1954
01:53:07.851 --> 01:53:10.730
I came back 20 minutes later and every single guy in the task unit had their

1955
01:53:10.731 --> 01:53:13.850
name on the list.
So we're,
we're you with guys at every single guy.

1956
01:53:13.851 --> 01:53:17.900
That's what they want to do.
Now.
Do they get tired?
Do they get combat stress?

1957
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:22.250
They absolutely do.
Do they get scared?
Yes they do.
It's,
it's hard.

1958
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:27.320
But we have a guy that at least start from the position of I want to do this.

1959
01:53:27.321 --> 01:53:29.750
This is my profession.
The army,
you know you,

1960
01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:32.540
you definitely ended up with guys that are coming in the army because they

1961
01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:35.680
wanted to pay for college or they wanted to get a job or they wanted to get out

1962
01:53:35.681 --> 01:53:38.660
of whatever hometown there in and,
and that's how they ended up in the army.

1963
01:53:38.810 --> 01:53:39.410
Again,

1964
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:43.230
there's also a great number of soldiers that are just as eager for combat and

1965
01:53:43.231 --> 01:53:47.300
certainly a great number of marines that are the same attitude.
So each,

1966
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:49.570
each one of those people,
you have your own challenges and it,

1967
01:53:49.571 --> 01:53:51.890
and it is hard and you do have to,

1968
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:56.510
and what goes back to what this whole thing has been about as the leader,

1969
01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:00.170
you can't be the one that's getting wrapped up in those emotions.

1970
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:03.020
You can't be the one when you,
yeah,
I'll tell you what,

1971
01:54:03.021 --> 01:54:06.950
your heart's going to be fucking broken.
When you lose guys,

1972
01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:11.540
it's going to be broken and you're going to want nothing more than to go out and

1973
01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:14.930
rubble cds and salt the earth.

1974
01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:18.830
So everyone is dead and no one will ever live there again.

1975
01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:26.100
But if you let that get ahold of you as the leader,
your,

1976
01:54:26.130 --> 01:54:30.750
your,
your team and your men are going to be in hell,

1977
01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:31.980
that's where they're going to end up.

1978
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:36.990
And so that's why the education,
the training,

1979
01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.350
the understanding of it,
it's so many people contacted me after I did the,
the,

1980
01:54:40.351 --> 01:54:44.450
the me lie podcast.
That isn't your thank you that they,

1981
01:54:44.451 --> 01:54:45.490
they play that meal.

1982
01:54:45.491 --> 01:54:50.370
I podcast for leadership training inside multiple military organizations.
It's,

1983
01:54:50.371 --> 01:54:51.204
it's awesome.

1984
01:54:51.210 --> 01:54:54.420
I'm so happy that they do that because when I came out with that podcast,

1985
01:54:54.421 --> 01:54:56.970
I had tons of people that said I didn't,
it didn't know about that.

1986
01:54:57.270 --> 01:55:00.450
People that were in leadership positions didn't understand,

1987
01:55:00.451 --> 01:55:03.780
didn't know what the meal I'm asking her was.
And it's,
uh,

1988
01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:07.920
it's one of the darkest stains on our history.

1989
01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:12.060
But you have to talk about it and you talked earlier about,
hey,

1990
01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:12.930
I don't want to make it.

1991
01:55:12.930 --> 01:55:15.690
I didn't really want to go into too much of what led up to it cause I didn't

1992
01:55:15.691 --> 01:55:17.550
want to make excuses,
man.

1993
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:21.480
I went into detail of why it happened because I want everyone to understand all

1994
01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:24.090
those little things.
How when you cut those corners,

1995
01:55:24.091 --> 01:55:28.590
how when you play the telephone game with your intelligence and you let people

1996
01:55:28.591 --> 01:55:31.320
say things that you don't put them in check and you don't,

1997
01:55:31.530 --> 01:55:34.800
you let them use words that are correct and you've people that don't have a

1998
01:55:34.801 --> 01:55:36.510
culture to ask why we're doing this.

1999
01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:41.750
And you set those situations up and you let bad leaders into situate or in

2000
01:55:41.941 --> 01:55:45.900
positions that they shouldn't be Cali failing out of ocs multiple times.

2001
01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:48.000
Like that's it.
That's it.

2002
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:53.030
You let those things happen and you're going to end up in hell and as a leader,

2003
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:56.260
that's your job to stop it.
Yeah.

2004
01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:59.770
<v 1>That's a good place to wrap it up,
man.
Me Lie.
You lie.</v>

2005
01:55:59.771 --> 01:56:02.080
It didn't necessarily happen on March,

2006
01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:06.010
1619 68 it happened when Kelly failed.
It was ocs.

2007
01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:09.340
It happened when the intelligence failed to get passed down properly.

2008
01:56:09.341 --> 01:56:13.420
It failed every time somebody was allowed to smack around a Vietnamese and they

2009
01:56:13.421 --> 01:56:16.780
didn't get called on it.
That's when it happened.
You know,
the,
the,
the,

2010
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:21.400
the actual acute incident was just the result of a long,
long process.
So.

2011
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:24.520
Awesome.
That's great man.
Thank you so much.

2012
01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:25.301
<v 0>Thanks for having me on.</v>

2013
01:56:25.301 --> 01:56:30.301
Thanks for you guys for what you do and you guys put out kick ass podcasts and I

2014
01:56:30.431 --> 01:56:34.810
appreciate listening to them.
And then maybe we'll get to do this again

2015
01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.240
<v 1>in South Dakota as well.
I mean,
I can tell you from my own personal,
uh,</v>

2016
01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:42.920
experience,
listen to your podcasts as well as a lot of guys I know of all ages,

2017
01:56:42.921 --> 01:56:46.280
guys from high school all the way on up into their 50s or one guy that I know is

2018
01:56:46.281 --> 01:56:48.710
a huge fan.
Um,
you know,
I don't want to,

2019
01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:52.610
it's just a three of us and it's getting a little sweaty in here already,

2020
01:56:52.611 --> 01:56:55.490
so I won't get on my knees too much.
But,
uh,
it's not an a,

2021
01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:57.770
it's not an exaggeration to say that you're changing people's lives,

2022
01:56:57.771 --> 01:57:01.550
so thank you and keep it up.
I mean,
we've had a great effect on me personally,

2023
01:57:01.551 --> 01:57:04.040
so thank you.
Thanks Barbara.
Thanks for listening.
Thanks guys.

2024
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:10.820
<v 0>And that wraps up the conversation and thanks for listening and thanks to Daryl</v>

2025
01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:16.020
Cooper and Danieli Bilali for organizing that discussion.

2026
01:57:16.021 --> 01:57:19.800
And I look forward to having some more of those types of conversations in the

2027
01:57:19.801 --> 01:57:24.801
future about history and about human nature and about leadership.

2028
01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:32.520
And in the meantime,
Echo.
Yes.

2029
01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.100
Speaking of leadership,

2030
01:57:35.490 --> 01:57:40.470
if people want to lead themselves down the right path,
the path,

2031
01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:45.030
yes.
Do you have any maybe recommendations for them?

2032
01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:49.890
Sure,
of course they do.
So we're all working out,

2033
01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:55.710
right?
Yeah.
Every day.
Yeah.
You work out every day.

2034
01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:00.310
Although I got sick,
he's just straight up at arrest.
Yeah.
Flu,

2035
01:58:01.050 --> 01:58:05.910
flu.
Yeah.
You know what that is?
Yeah,
man,
I hear bad things.
Yeah.

2036
01:58:05.950 --> 01:58:09.780
No,
it wasn't your shot did.
I didn't get that.
Amen.
You know,

2037
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:13.080
I hear mixed reviews about the whole flute deal.
Either way,

2038
01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:15.700
you're obviously better.
You seem better and better,

2039
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:20.220
which is good because now you can get back to working out and when you get back

2040
01:58:20.221 --> 01:58:23.190
to working out,
you still want to maintain your joint sick or not sick,

2041
01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.290
maintain your joints.
That's what I think.

2042
01:58:26.130 --> 01:58:29.430
I think everyone would agree with me on that one and the way you maintain your

2043
01:58:29.431 --> 01:58:33.360
joints is to take joint supplements like Krill oil,
Jocko,
super krill oil.

2044
01:58:33.361 --> 01:58:36.240
That's the good one.
Talk with supplements.
That's right.

2045
01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:41.040
Also a good supplement called joint warfare.
I take those every single day,

2046
01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:42.250
every single day.

2047
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:46.420
<v 4>No version,
no slack,
no slack unless you run out,
but here's the thing,</v>

2048
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:48.670
you don't have to run out anymore.
You subscribe,

2049
01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:53.530
you get the subscription situation.
Everyone,
30 days,
60 days,

2050
01:58:53.531 --> 01:58:56.830
whatever,
however much you use or whatever.
You got an estimate and then boom,

2051
01:58:56.831 --> 01:59:00.610
you do your subscription and you get one in the mail every month.
Never run out.

2052
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.020
Maintain the joints.
Important.

2053
01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:08.220
More important than your power mass gainer 5,000 I think so too.

2054
01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:16.690
Yeah.
Also you want some cognitive enhancements which you do.

2055
01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.200
You do.
You totally do.
Brothers like you know,

2056
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:24.190
cell phone signals and you know pollutions,

2057
01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:28.210
pollutants from cars.
That's a mess up your brain.

2058
01:59:28.211 --> 01:59:30.100
Sometimes you need some cognitive enhancement.

2059
01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:35.970
Jock was another supplement called discipline.
It's a pre mission cognitive,

2060
01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:38.770
physical enhancement,
cognitive enhancement,

2061
01:59:39.070 --> 01:59:43.090
all in one boom and it tastes good.
Boom.
Take it.

2062
01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:45.610
I would say take that everyday you take it before stuff.

2063
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:47.550
So you call it a pre mission indicates you take it

2064
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:51.100
<v 0>or you do something where you even before it,
before I do a mission,</v>

2065
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:56.860
that mission could be going to work with a company like hey I'm going to need to

2066
01:59:56.861 --> 02:00:01.150
be on my a game mentally and cause we're solving problems for digging in the

2067
02:00:01.151 --> 02:00:03.460
leadership situations.
We're finding out what's going on.

2068
02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.660
Any game has got a calm also Jujitsu.
Yeah.

2069
02:00:07.690 --> 02:00:09.220
But the people always say,

2070
02:00:09.221 --> 02:00:13.240
well I thought you didn't take preop workouts and I don't.
Not for a workout.

2071
02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:18.700
Oh yeah.
For the workouts.
I mean I might do that one out of every 10 workouts,

2072
02:00:18.850 --> 02:00:23.530
maybe even 21 I take some kind of a pre pre workout.
Yeah.

2073
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:29.430
It's cause when I wake up in the morning I'm not hungry.
Yeah.
Not even third.

2074
02:00:29.530 --> 02:00:31.750
I mean I drink water,
but I'm not like that.

2075
02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:36.800
I don't feel the need for some jack me up during the workout and I'm just going

2076
02:00:37.371 --> 02:00:38.530
to go get it.
Yeah.

2077
02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:41.740
And you don't really drink coffee so you don't even have that situation.

2078
02:00:41.741 --> 02:00:44.760
You know?
I don't like coffee and people will ask why I don't like coffee.

2079
02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:47.530
Don't like the taste of it tastes horrible.
Yes.
So what that did,

2080
02:00:47.531 --> 02:00:52.531
is it like it made you or it didn't allow you to get into the coffee system?

2081
02:00:52.631 --> 02:00:54.190
Because that's really what it is.
I mean,

2082
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:56.890
I hate to call and everyone says it's an acquired taste.

2083
02:00:57.070 --> 02:00:59.140
My question is when something is an acquired taste,

2084
02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:02.200
how many times do you have to drink something that's socks before you're like,

2085
02:01:02.201 --> 02:01:06.300
okay,
I like the smell.
You acquire that.
Uh,
yeah man.

2086
02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:10.150
And there was an,
to me there was no,
it wasn't like,
Hey,
if I can get this,

2087
02:01:10.151 --> 02:01:14.010
if I can start liking this,
I'll be,
I'll be stronger.
Not,

2088
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:16.030
I wasn't going to happen.
It was like,
Hey,

2089
02:01:16.031 --> 02:01:20.320
if I start liking us and I'll spend $4 a day at a coffee store,
no,
not happening.

2090
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:22.240
Well usually,
I mean like beer,
right?

2091
02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:27.300
When you first drink beer typically tastes that you don't like is I am not good

2092
02:01:27.311 --> 02:01:30.220
with any acquired taste.
No,
not chocolate milk.
Chocolate milk.

2093
02:01:30.221 --> 02:01:33.460
Right off the bat everyone immediately acquired,

2094
02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:37.960
yeah wait to try the milk.
That's not an acquired taste.

2095
02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.130
<v 4>Yeah.
And that's probably why you make things taste good because you don't,</v>

2096
02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.510
you're not down for the whole acquired situation or taste well.
Okay.

2097
02:01:47.511 --> 02:01:51.890
So like beer,
coffee is the same deal because there's a,

2098
02:01:51.891 --> 02:01:56.030
there's a benefit beyond just the taste.
So beer is like,
yeah,

2099
02:01:56.031 --> 02:01:57.980
you get drunk or whatever and people like that,

2100
02:01:58.130 --> 02:02:01.550
but it's like Dang the beers kind of this barrier.
Like I wish it tasted better,

2101
02:02:01.551 --> 02:02:05.660
blah blah blah.
That's why they do Jello shots,
you know,
just get in there anyway.

2102
02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:07.760
So after a while you're like,

2103
02:02:07.761 --> 02:02:12.560
you know what all endure the taste to get a bit of venture.
You like the taste.

2104
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:15.350
You ended up liking the taste because you can kind of recognize certain,

2105
02:02:15.351 --> 02:02:17.870
you know,
there's all kinds of things.
Same thing with coffee.

2106
02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:21.470
You kind of start to like the taste because the originally,

2107
02:02:21.471 --> 02:02:25.040
initially you want to get the boost,
the caffeine boost.

2108
02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:30.200
Well the good thing is with,
with the products that we make,
there's no,

2109
02:02:30.230 --> 02:02:33.080
they're not acquired taste this taste good.
Direct.

2110
02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:36.500
A delicious can just get taste correct from the get go.

2111
02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:40.520
And just this discipline pre mission is no exception.
Tastes good.

2112
02:02:40.970 --> 02:02:44.850
It's like a lemon lime.
Is that the official flavor official lemon lime official.

2113
02:02:44.851 --> 02:02:47.780
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a good one because that's like a real like broad,

2114
02:02:47.781 --> 02:02:49.560
like most people are gonna like the lemon lime.
Yeah.

2115
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:52.000
Like it takes a Weirdo than not like lemon.
Now you've got to,

2116
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:55.490
it's not that that's a bad thing you're probably missed,

2117
02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:59.960
but nonetheless it does taste good.
I will agree with that.

2118
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:05.290
And I think it's one of those deals where you can just take it even if it's not

2119
02:03:05.901 --> 02:03:08.360
right before some stuff I just drink it.

2120
02:03:08.361 --> 02:03:13.270
Sometimes I'm just straight up wants something sweet,
just trade out.

2121
02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:16.580
It's all good for your brain and stuff.
Yeah,
man.
Is that a lack of discipline?

2122
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:19.160
I want something sweet.
No,

2123
02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:24.170
because unless it's like a bad thing because you think about you want to break

2124
02:03:24.171 --> 02:03:28.660
it down.
What makes something a lack of discipline?
It's like when you slipped,

2125
02:03:28.661 --> 02:03:30.680
when it's like goes beyond your intentions,
right?

2126
02:03:30.681 --> 02:03:33.440
If you intend to do something but then it's like,
oh my immediate,

2127
02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:35.780
no payoff is going to kind of get in the way or whatever.

2128
02:03:35.781 --> 02:03:37.010
Then that's why it's okay to be like,

2129
02:03:37.011 --> 02:03:40.520
tomorrow I'm going to have a mint chocolate chip milkshake.
Yeah.
It kinda is.

2130
02:03:40.521 --> 02:03:42.470
Not Today,
tomorrow,

2131
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:46.850
but if that deviated from your original whole plan,
then it's lack of discipline.

2132
02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.650
Like if you're like,
oh,
I'm really craving a shake.

2133
02:03:48.651 --> 02:03:50.120
I won't have it today but I'll have it tomorrow.

2134
02:03:50.150 --> 02:03:52.850
Even though the plan is doesn't entail you having it tomorrow,
man.

2135
02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:55.640
It's like a lack of discipline just on a bigger scale I guess,

2136
02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:00.770
or more belong longevity,
skill check.
Nonetheless.
Discipline.

2137
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.140
It's good.
Tastes good.
It feels good.

2138
02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.800
It won't take discipline to take discipline knows what I'm saying?

2139
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:09.530
Like cause it's going to taste good.
It's going to make your,

2140
02:04:09.531 --> 02:04:11.480
you're saying you know what it is when you take it.

2141
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:15.060
I was talking to Jane about this.
It's like a,
um,

2142
02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.880
you know how like when you're searching for a word,

2143
02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:19.730
you know when you're trying to explain something and like let's say out of know

2144
02:04:19.731 --> 02:04:22.730
your brain is off.
You're hung over four year,

2145
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:24.910
didn't get enough sleep or whatever and you're searching,

2146
02:04:24.930 --> 02:04:25.970
oh what's that word again?

2147
02:04:26.090 --> 02:04:28.910
Or you forget someone's name like your friend or something like this.

2148
02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:34.220
It's almost like the discipline is going to connect those dots for you.
Yeah.

2149
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:35.960
And this is what it feels like.
You don't feel like,

2150
02:04:35.961 --> 02:04:39.180
you know what you ever played the lottery like power ball or something?

2151
02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:42.960
Not really cool.
You ever seen like on the news how they get the balls?
Yeah.

2152
02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:46.230
It's like this big around cage that they spin and all the,

2153
02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.680
all the balls fly around in there and then they just kind of,

2154
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:52.110
one randomly comes into the little shoot there.
It's what it feels like.

2155
02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:53.790
It's like that's all the words.

2156
02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:59.040
It's your brain and that's all the words and man that correct words just not

2157
02:04:59.041 --> 02:05:00.870
shoot.
He's not coming in there.
You know what I mean?

2158
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:04.860
But the discipline shoots the right words in there like no,
like one speed,
boom,

2159
02:05:04.861 --> 02:05:07.320
boom,
boom,
boom.
See what I'm saying?
That's what it feels like.

2160
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:11.330
Take this one when the lottery to check.
Yup.

2161
02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:13.370
Same exact thing nonetheless as good.

2162
02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:17.280
Get that@originmain.com that's where you can get all this stuff.

2163
02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:22.370
Origin labs,
they're producing it by the truckload for us.

2164
02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:23.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2165
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:28.100
<v 4>Also an origin main.com there's some good keys on there.</v>

2166
02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:33.370
Really good.
[inaudible] only gives,
I'm wearing now forever.
Forever.
Straight up.

2167
02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:35.770
And they're made in America.
By the way,

2168
02:05:36.670 --> 02:05:39.430
the cottons made in America sewn in America.

2169
02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:44.170
Lu Loom is not a verb woven with looms.

2170
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:46.840
Wrong word,
lottery.
Just pop

2171
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.200
to do a verb.
Maybe that's proactive.

2172
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:58.060
It's true.
See,
hey,
what?
Shakespeare made up a word.
Everyone was cool with it.

2173
02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:00.520
All of a sudden that came cool.
And you can make words.

2174
02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:02.270
All you need is people to sign up.

2175
02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:07.300
So you know why the cotton is straight up loomed in America and sold and you

2176
02:06:08.010 --> 02:06:11.500
assembled in them.
They're made in America,
straight up the GIES,

2177
02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:15.400
this rash guards on their compression gear,
if you will,
pants and tops.

2178
02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:21.460
By the way,
it's not just cotton,
you know?
That's why it's so different.
Yeah.

2179
02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:26.400
Because it's,
it's,
it's a hybrid blend.
It's not just cotton.
All right.

2180
02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:31.000
So yeah,
there's that.
That's why the material dries quicker.

2181
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:34.810
That's why it's antimicrobrial type doesn't smell bad.

2182
02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:37.960
That's why it dries out quick.
That's why it's lighter because it's,

2183
02:06:38.230 --> 02:06:42.910
it's made from the get go for Jujitsu.
Yeah.
So yeah,

2184
02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:44.230
and that is a big deal.
If you,

2185
02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:47.230
if you take Jujitsu and you even just pay even that much attention to that kind

2186
02:06:47.231 --> 02:06:50.110
of stuff,
it makes a difference.
And then tried to go back to your old g,

2187
02:06:50.111 --> 02:06:54.520
you can be like,
Brent,
why don't even do that to my origin sticking with it.

2188
02:06:54.521 --> 02:06:58.180
That's why I'm sticking with it.
Also,
speaking of,
did you have to,

2189
02:06:58.190 --> 02:06:59.500
there's an immersion camp.

2190
02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:00.290
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2191
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:05.290
<v 4>Coming up or August 26 through September 2nd is to two sessions.</v>

2192
02:07:08.150 --> 02:07:11.910
Right.
Early late session.
I'm going,
Jackie going,

2193
02:07:12.170 --> 02:07:14.390
I am going both sessions.

2194
02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:18.860
Port Jocko was so mad he couldn't participate last time.
Yeah.

2195
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:25.260
He was almost like something.
Was there just bothering you the whole time?
Oh No,

2196
02:07:25.261 --> 02:07:29.310
no.
A lot.
Yeah.
Well he didn't show it that much,
but you could tell.

2197
02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:33.960
Well yeah,
I wouldn't say I let it get to me.
Right.
But it definitely bothered me.

2198
02:07:33.961 --> 02:07:35.030
It would show every,

2199
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:38.950
every once in awhile unless Jack will be there in full effect this time.

2200
02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:43.900
And uh,
yeah,
I'll be there and uh,
you know,

2201
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:47.650
we can immerse ourselves in Jujitsu.
That's what it is.

2202
02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:52.660
It's not a bootcamp.
August 26 through September 2nd yeah.
That's a good one.

2203
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:53.770
Coming to origin.
Yeah.

2204
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:58.030
So go to origin main.com you can look at literally all of these.
It's immersion.

2205
02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:01.350
It's you through immersion camp.
You can only do Jujitsu.
How many days,

2206
02:08:01.450 --> 02:08:04.480
how many hours a day can you do Jujitsu?
What in real life or in the camp?

2207
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:06.550
In the camp and in real life.

2208
02:08:06.610 --> 02:08:11.610
I guess technically in the camp you can do it for 24 hours.

2209
02:08:11.621 --> 02:08:15.130
Really technically,
if you really want to know realistically,

2210
02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:16.930
what do you think someone does?

2211
02:08:16.931 --> 02:08:19.760
Two or three hours in the morning and two or three hours in the afternoon or
bed,

2212
02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:22.360
two hours in the morning,
two hours in the afternoon,
two hours in the evening,

2213
02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:26.440
six hours a day.
Yeah.
Be Sore.
Yeah.
If you're going getting after it,

2214
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:28.150
which you're not obligated to do,

2215
02:08:28.151 --> 02:08:32.230
but that's the freedom you have and that's how good it is.
And that's the thing,

2216
02:08:32.231 --> 02:08:36.280
man.
So you know how like let's say you for example,
yeah.
And you're like,
Hey,

2217
02:08:36.281 --> 02:08:38.900
I want to on a rule,
two hours in the morning,
two hours afternoon,

2218
02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:42.550
two hours at night.
I,
but here's the thing,
you can't just decide to roll.

2219
02:08:42.551 --> 02:08:45.250
You got to roll with somebody,
otherwise you just rolling by yourself.

2220
02:08:45.550 --> 02:08:49.930
So that's a problem in the real world.
Not everyone you know,
but this camp,

2221
02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:54.790
oh yeah.
Every single time.
Pining people,
by the way,
all levels.
Boom.

2222
02:08:54.910 --> 02:08:57.760
So yeah,
get some,
even if you've never done Jujitsu,

2223
02:08:57.970 --> 02:09:02.040
ever still go and learn some shit to get off to [inaudible].

2224
02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:06.490
It's a good way to look.
The ground running.
Immersion.
Yup.

2225
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:09.190
Fully or domain.com check.

2226
02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:12.920
Look at all this stuff and you know Dave Burke's coming by the way.
Yeah.

2227
02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:16.080
I'm looking forward to them.
Lister Immersion Jujitsu in time.

2228
02:09:16.090 --> 02:09:18.790
Dave Burke calls me.
I see his name pop up on my phone.
Like you know,

2229
02:09:18.791 --> 02:09:21.250
every once in a while you'll run into that guy who can give you that feeling

2230
02:09:21.251 --> 02:09:23.980
like,
oh gosh,
Dave Brooks calling me.
Yeah,
good deal.

2231
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:26.150
Did it kind of like brightens your day?
A little new?

2232
02:09:26.151 --> 02:09:28.540
I don't know what else is coming.
I don't know if JP is going to calm her life.

2233
02:09:28.850 --> 02:09:33.700
Yeah.
Gotta check the schedules.
Yeah.
Got To block the F team schedules.
Yeah,

2234
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:36.430
that'd be good if both of them come.
They've been,

2235
02:09:36.431 --> 02:09:39.890
I've been noticing they've been getting their train on or trying to train.
Yeah,

2236
02:09:39.891 --> 02:09:44.230
man.
That's good.
Also,
speaking of the training,

2237
02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:49.000
if you want some good fitness gear,
mix up the workout,

2238
02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:52.780
keep more creative with the workout with the movements and equipment.

2239
02:09:52.781 --> 02:09:57.670
Could have [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko get yourself some primal bells.

2240
02:09:57.730 --> 02:09:59.620
I highly recommend.
By the way,

2241
02:09:59.621 --> 02:10:02.710
someone hit me up because we had this conversation last time.

2242
02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:05.340
You said that my workouts were boring.
Yeah.

2243
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:10.630
And someone kind of sided with me just so you know.
Cool.

2244
02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:15.730
Cause I said the workouts can be boring if you're boring,
right?

2245
02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:19.030
Yeah we did.
But the thing is we did people sided with me.

2246
02:10:20.190 --> 02:10:22.480
Well they're right and,
and straight up.
You're right.

2247
02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:27.640
Because I think we kind of concluded that to where,
yeah,
you know,

2248
02:10:27.850 --> 02:10:31.480
if you're boring or if you intentionally make it boring,
it's boring.
That's how,

2249
02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:32.820
in fact the board ill,

2250
02:10:32.890 --> 02:10:36.890
the boredom and the boringness of the workout can be part of a certain type of

2251
02:10:36.891 --> 02:10:39.150
training.
You know,
it's like a mental endurance training yet.

2252
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:44.030
So it's a whole big thing.
And I was irresponsible to accuse you ever do,

2253
02:10:44.050 --> 02:10:48.710
do you ever do a workout where you just do one movement the whole the whole

2254
02:10:48.711 --> 02:10:53.450
time?
No.
Wait,
there is some mental,
not a fool.
There's some sort of like,

2255
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:56.840
there's definitely something to that mentally.
Yeah.
You know like,

2256
02:10:56.841 --> 02:11:01.370
oh I'm just going to do 500 repetitions of whatever this is.
Actually.

2257
02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:05.450
Yes,
I have.
It was snatch.
So get a little snack.
Here's the thing though.

2258
02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:08.820
It was I kind of bus notch?
No.
Oh,
barbells.
Okay.

2259
02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:13.280
It was a cross fit 500 snatches it.
No,

2260
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:18.290
it was um,
that's my joke.
I forget how many,
it was a dumb amount.

2261
02:11:18.291 --> 02:11:20.510
Put it that way.
Well,
at the time I thought it was anyway,

2262
02:11:20.511 --> 02:11:24.460
I forget how much it was probably for you
too.

2263
02:11:25.190 --> 02:11:28.600
I mean it's already done.
I think it was 200 board FFT.

2264
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:34.400
You powered through those last five reps though.
Almost sucking.

2265
02:11:36.010 --> 02:11:40.250
I did it,
but that was it.
That's the only thing.
Super Sore the next day.

2266
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:44.900
Yeah,
but that's it.
Yeah.
Snatch.
Let's not just kind of a fun exercise though.

2267
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:48.720
That's the thing.
Yeah.
Well
Fun.

2268
02:11:49.370 --> 02:11:52.910
But the movement is like,
it's more dynamic than just a,
um,
you know,

2269
02:11:52.911 --> 02:11:55.790
like the thing with exercises like the snatch,

2270
02:11:56.150 --> 02:11:59.630
if you're not focused on,
this one's real simple,

2271
02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:01.700
but if you don't focus box jump.

2272
02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:04.940
If you let your mind wander during a Bostrom Mexican,
you know,

2273
02:12:04.941 --> 02:12:09.590
you've got an eight inch savage scarf.
Yeah.

2274
02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:10.910
Yeah.
Very true.

2275
02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:15.500
You ever near miss a box jump and it like wakes you up and you're like,
oh man,

2276
02:12:15.501 --> 02:12:18.850
I wasn't paying attention.
Was paid the man on that one.
You know,

2277
02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:21.290
I don't do that much box jumps probably.
I used to,

2278
02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.440
I used to box jump like a savage check all your own.

2279
02:12:28.101 --> 02:12:31.490
Perfect.
Super stoked that I know that now.

2280
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:33.110
Nonetheless,

2281
02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:38.630
there's some cool workout equipment.
Gear on.

2282
02:12:38.631 --> 02:12:43.130
They're boring workout or not get creative.
Boom,

2283
02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:46.280
look on there.
A lot of stuff.
I was just on their night yesterday.
Day before.

2284
02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:52.070
Good.
Good,
good website.
Good Info too,
by the way on it.com/jocko.
Good spot.

2285
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:55.970
Good way to support.
Also when you get these books,

2286
02:12:56.150 --> 02:13:00.080
I think I'm designing the website good.
I think so.

2287
02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:03.650
I think it's old one now.
Those,

2288
02:13:03.850 --> 02:13:08.300
it was the anticipated list.
Why are you trying to get around to it?

2289
02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:12.620
Rather the website was old looking since didn't want,
by the way.
Nonetheless.

2290
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:16.000
Anyway,
back to the point,
uh,

2291
02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:21.020
when you get any of the books that we review,

2292
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:25.880
including Jockos actual books where the word kit,

2293
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:29.960
extreme ownership,
the field manual,
all these books.
Look,

2294
02:13:29.961 --> 02:13:30.890
I'm going to list it on the,

2295
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:36.330
and the books are listed by episode in the book section.

2296
02:13:37.190 --> 02:13:38.760
You just clicked through there when you get them.
Boom.

2297
02:13:38.761 --> 02:13:42.720
Good way to support takes Amazon as a prime.
One day shipping.
Boom.
Good,

2298
02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:46.230
good way to support to buy yet come through there.
Good way to support.

2299
02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:50.520
Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.
Seems obvious.
I know,

2300
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:54.810
but some people they haven't subscribed and they're not obligated to,

2301
02:13:54.811 --> 02:13:58.440
but if you do want to support your subscribes,
good way.
Also on Youtube,

2302
02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:02.940
I want to say subscribe and talking,
iTunes,
stitcher,
Google,
play,
all that stuff.

2303
02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:07.560
And Youtube.
So don't exclude youtube.
The video version of this podcast,

2304
02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:11.880
which you've been pretty motivated on lately.
We'll say active.
Sure.
I don't,

2305
02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:15.870
I don't count on motivation.
I try to stick with the discipline.

2306
02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:20.700
I see what she did there.
Nonetheless,
I am disciplined with it,

2307
02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:25.800
but I am motivated to cause,
you know,
I understand the value of excerpts.

2308
02:14:25.801 --> 02:14:29.130
Now someone emailed me the other day,
Hey,
this excerpt of uh,

2309
02:14:29.490 --> 02:14:33.090
not joining the military or something about regrading that during the military.

2310
02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:36.240
This is what he did.
He had,
I think he had like a medical thing where it's like,

2311
02:14:36.241 --> 02:14:37.290
oh,
he couldn't pass or whatever,

2312
02:14:37.291 --> 02:14:41.280
but he still could do work for the military in other parts.
You know what I mean?

2313
02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:46.080
So it's like became like an electronics technician for the military even though

2314
02:14:46.081 --> 02:14:49.080
he wasn't in the military.
Yeah.
Served.
Yeah.
See what I'm saying?

2315
02:14:49.081 --> 02:14:51.780
So like those little excerpts can kind of offer this info,

2316
02:14:51.781 --> 02:14:55.800
whether it be advice or just spark other questions and people maybe they

2317
02:14:55.801 --> 02:14:56.400
wouldn't have got it.

2318
02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.890
Maybe they miss that episode or maybe they just weren't interested

2319
02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:00.560
<v 0>episode.</v>

2320
02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.560
Somebody pointed out or somebody made a really funny meme that it showed you

2321
02:15:08.250 --> 02:15:09.460
didn't show,
you make an excerpt,

2322
02:15:09.461 --> 02:15:12.340
but it showed like someone discovering excerpt and like,
wow,
this is awesome.

2323
02:15:12.341 --> 02:15:16.630
And then it said,
oh no,
episode number attached to the SEC,
sir.

2324
02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:21.160
So meaning,
Hey,
glad I got the extra.
Now where can I find this?

2325
02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:25.670
So in the future we may want to add the episode number in there.

2326
02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:30.910
Yeah.
So did you know that there was a big mean more?
No,
it was on the boards.

2327
02:15:30.970 --> 02:15:33.350
I need more,
I guess I don't,

2328
02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:37.450
I can't really follow it 100% because it was all in reddit and,

2329
02:15:37.630 --> 02:15:40.900
but I read an article about,
there was like a legit me more.

2330
02:15:41.250 --> 02:15:42.550
What's a name more though?

2331
02:15:42.590 --> 02:15:45.850
Well me more is different memes going back and forth at each other.

2332
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.020
But there was a me more and I've,
I've seen a funny,
somebody asked me one time,

2333
02:15:50.021 --> 02:15:53.920
they had a,
they had a ball cap.
You ever seen the ball caps that say,
you know,

2334
02:15:53.921 --> 02:15:56.560
Vietnam War veteran or Afghanistan,

2335
02:15:57.150 --> 02:16:01.090
Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom of war veteran or something like that.

2336
02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:05.020
Someone wrote me up or sent me a picture and said,
is this,

2337
02:16:05.650 --> 02:16:08.680
is it offensive for me to wear this hat?
And the hat said,
you know,

2338
02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:10.800
survivor of me more.

2339
02:16:10.801 --> 02:16:14.350
And it looked like it looked like a legit veterans at and I kind of was like,

2340
02:16:14.490 --> 02:16:16.180
no man,
as far as I'm concerned,
you're good.

2341
02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:21.210
I don't know what you've been through on the day.
I can,

2342
02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:25.200
<v 4>I don't know what the meaning more is.
I will,
I'm going to look into it</v>

2343
02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:30.130
<v 0>more on reddit.
Yeah.
Very rarely.
It had to do with sequels.
See,
I can't</v>

2344
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.290
<v 4>say the whole,
I don't understand it well enough,</v>

2345
02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:35.950
but I understand it well enough to laugh and think.
It's funny.

2346
02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:40.570
I think it's very compelling.
Hundred percent me more those means are funny,
man.

2347
02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:44.650
The real funny creative.
That's good.
That's a good thing.

2348
02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:50.680
Nonetheless,
excerpts.
I do put the episode on there.
By the way,

2349
02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:54.070
here's the thing.
When you go into,
when you go to a Youtube,
oh,

2350
02:16:54.071 --> 02:16:57.160
you gotta go to the read more or something.
You got to click on read more.

2351
02:16:57.310 --> 02:16:59.560
That's the thing.
So it looks like,
by the way,

2352
02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:03.920
I was reading youtube comments here the day.
Oh,
dance.
Bold.
That's a wacky,
wild.

2353
02:17:04.690 --> 02:17:08.320
Someone wrote,
why are we even making these comments?

2354
02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:12.960
Jocko and echo don't even read them.
Guess what?
Jocko reads them.
I read them.

2355
02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:16.090
Dang.
There you go.
Me More.
What's going on?
I had to do something.

2356
02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:21.550
Take some,
some kind of act.
It's just read the comments.
Actually,

2357
02:17:21.551 --> 02:17:24.550
that makes sense.
But here's the thing about youtube comments.
This is,

2358
02:17:24.610 --> 02:17:27.510
this isn't new by the way.
So a lot of people know this rate.

2359
02:17:27.511 --> 02:17:29.230
We're youtube comments seem to be,

2360
02:17:29.231 --> 02:17:31.480
maybe this is probably other forms and stuff where they get worse,

2361
02:17:31.481 --> 02:17:36.481
but youtube has the most potential for terrible comments and for no reason to,

2362
02:17:36.701 --> 02:17:39.370
so this isn't it because it's completely unregulated.

2363
02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:44.470
Well you know the words on a Facebook comment or on a Twitter comment,

2364
02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:49.180
generally it's your purse.
You're,
you're a human being.
Yeah.
Onto,
on Youtube.

2365
02:17:49.181 --> 02:17:50.470
You're just,
you're just a,
yeah,

2366
02:17:50.471 --> 02:17:54.040
you can create an account pretty easy and they can't really think.
Yeah.

2367
02:17:54.041 --> 02:17:58.200
So it's anonymous,
you know,
it's close to an anonymous.
So the,
the,

2368
02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:00.580
the key is,
or the kind of the thing,

2369
02:18:00.581 --> 02:18:03.640
the result is like if you're going to read youtube comments on your,

2370
02:18:03.641 --> 02:18:07.030
or your content to a,
you gotta gotta gotta have fixed in,

2371
02:18:07.090 --> 02:18:08.620
in real thick skin cause they get,

2372
02:18:08.710 --> 02:18:12.930
it's like they're trying to hurt your feelings.
Like they're trying,
you know,

2373
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:18.760
I think
they are and they can be.
And that's the thing.

2374
02:18:18.761 --> 02:18:22.480
People are creative and creativity is just,
is a really broad thing.

2375
02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:26.200
And people didn't,
when they use creativity that try to like try to get you,

2376
02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:27.910
they can if you don't have fixed in.

2377
02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:31.090
And I've experienced this Kate and you don't remember when he used to do the

2378
02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:31.993
hand out those show.

2379
02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:37.160
Yeah that's a anytime you're doing like comedy stuff or I dunno like any kind of

2380
02:18:37.590 --> 02:18:39.280
like creative stuff to me,

2381
02:18:39.281 --> 02:18:44.080
your stuff now he's really hard to be like good socks and try to like,
you know,

2382
02:18:44.081 --> 02:18:47.620
so it's kind of easy.
I think he,
we kind of have it easy in that way,

2383
02:18:47.650 --> 02:18:51.100
in that way because if someone's like Jack was so stupid or something like that,

2384
02:18:51.130 --> 02:18:54.430
they make themselves look dumb cause it's so obviously not stupid,

2385
02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:57.850
but when you do like a comedy thing,
well at,
to me anyway,
I dunno.

2386
02:18:58.270 --> 02:19:02.230
So when you do like a comedy thing or you know,
something like that,

2387
02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:07.260
there's something of the nature of [inaudible] Shul or bikini girls doing

2388
02:19:07.661 --> 02:19:09.460
lightsaber fights or something like that.

2389
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:13.780
People were going to tear that stuff apart and the stuff they say,
it's like,

2390
02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:14.980
Dang,
I didn't even think about that.

2391
02:19:14.981 --> 02:19:18.370
But now I'm kind of have a complex about my videos now,
you know,
kind of thing.

2392
02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:21.310
So that's how I started on youtube by the way.

2393
02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:26.230
So I was like kind of new to youtube and putting stuff on when he got an audit

2394
02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:29.060
got shredded and the feelings,
and here's the thing too,

2395
02:19:29.070 --> 02:19:30.980
but you don't really have thick skin.

2396
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.120
I would say then that that time it was thinner in the beginning.

2397
02:19:35.121 --> 02:19:38.180
I don't think anyone really has thick skin unless they have the heads up going

2398
02:19:38.181 --> 02:19:41.300
in.
So,
and here's the weird thing.
It's like most people,

2399
02:19:41.301 --> 02:19:43.610
they like it because their friends have had natto or something like that.

2400
02:19:43.611 --> 02:19:48.080
But then one,
one guy now after like 50 comments of like all of these groups,

2401
02:19:48.190 --> 02:19:52.160
lyrics and there's videos funny or whatever,
whatever one guy says it sucks.

2402
02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:55.400
You're like,
fuck,
it sucks.
I know it's a,
you know,
he gets to you.

2403
02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:57.390
It's weird how that works.
Nonetheless.

2404
02:19:57.710 --> 02:20:01.490
The point is you reading the youtube comments is a Wacky,
wild,

2405
02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:05.850
bold adventure and I respect you for going,
going on that adventure.

2406
02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:09.890
Nonetheless,
Joppa reads them.
So boom,
question answered,
right?

2407
02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:13.490
Was it a question or do they say they don't know?

2408
02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:15.620
You don't use a statement saying straight up.

2409
02:20:15.621 --> 02:20:17.300
They don't really know why we're even writing anything.

2410
02:20:17.301 --> 02:20:20.200
Jocko and echo don't even read these comments.
Meanwhile,

2411
02:20:20.210 --> 02:20:23.630
he wrote that I was borderline like maybe I should just respond for once and
say,

2412
02:20:23.631 --> 02:20:26.290
Hey,
what I'm right here.
We're eating.
Yeah.

2413
02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:29.690
And the darkness that came out of the darkness for once.
Yeah,
man,
that's good.

2414
02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:34.490
Maybe that's another way to engage.
Right.
I just figured like Youtube comments,

2415
02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:38.120
um,
is Kinda,
I dunno.
It's not as authentic,
you know,

2416
02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:43.400
random anonymous.
Yeah.
A lot of stuff,
which is kind of a bummer.

2417
02:20:43.870 --> 02:20:45.170
Yeah.
Nonetheless,

2418
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:49.790
if you want subscribe to the Youtube Channel for the video version and excerpts,

2419
02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:52.700
which are valuable,
I've come to know the value of,

2420
02:20:52.820 --> 02:20:55.370
of excerpts and um,
you know,

2421
02:20:55.420 --> 02:20:58.910
some enhance excerpts calling me enhanced.
Put some music on there,

2422
02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:04.040
some text,
kinetic typography.
You know what that is.
Does that sound familiar?

2423
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:07.080
Well,
kinetic,
I know what that means.
I know what that means,

2424
02:21:07.090 --> 02:21:11.510
so I'm putting it together.
Yeah,
man.
So you know,
Eh,
when you put it on a video,

2425
02:21:11.511 --> 02:21:14.120
it's like you know the words kind of ad and get animated on there.

2426
02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:18.290
That's what it's called.
Yeah.
You liked that stuff.
I like it too.
It does.

2427
02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:21.980
It becomes kind of captivating.
Some people aren't really good at it,
man.

2428
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:26.460
They do it anyway.
Nonetheless.
Cool videos on there.
John subscribed,
subscribed,

2429
02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:29.780
good way to support also chocolate store.

2430
02:21:29.930 --> 02:21:34.340
It's called Jocko store.com.
It's called Jocko store.

2431
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:36.860
The website is [inaudible] dot com that's what I'm saying.

2432
02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:42.140
That's where you can get your shirts.
Same Shirt Jocko wears every day.

2433
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:44.750
The victory MMA shirt.
You can get it there.
Boom.

2434
02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:48.740
Also discipline equals freedom.
Get after it.

2435
02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:53.660
Some bumper stickers on their decals,
on their hoodies,
on their women's stuff,

2436
02:21:53.661 --> 02:21:56.900
on their patches.
Velcro beanies.

2437
02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:02.740
I haven't seen any of these guards are on their cashmere blend directly picked

2438
02:22:05.211 --> 02:22:09.660
from the high mountains of Bulgaria.
Uh,

2439
02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:14.780
well the good news about to be nice is that they're in route,

2440
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:20.000
in route,
en route,
en route.
That's any car on the way.

2441
02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:22.030
Straight up put in the order door.

2442
02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:25.680
We came down to the all the stuff and then boom,
they're on the way,
man.

2443
02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:30.310
Straight up.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
Christmas is on the way,
right?

2444
02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:34.290
It'd be worth the wait,
I think,
in my opinion,

2445
02:22:35.130 --> 02:22:39.180
unless it's called Jocko store.com if you want something,
get something,

2446
02:22:39.181 --> 02:22:42.900
check out the stuff.
If you like it,
get something good way to support.

2447
02:22:43.050 --> 02:22:45.780
Also psychological warfare.
If you didn't know what that is,

2448
02:22:45.781 --> 02:22:50.370
it's an album on iTunes and stitcher and in wherever you can buy MP three s it's

2449
02:22:50.371 --> 02:22:53.970
an album [inaudible] album with tracks Jocko tracks.

2450
02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:57.220
I don't think you can buy mp3s on Stitcher,
by the way.
Oh yeah.
Then no,

2451
02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:01.260
don't go to stitcher then for good Amazon music or something like that or Google

2452
02:23:01.261 --> 02:23:06.120
play or you know,
wherever else you can get them.
You understand what I'm saying?

2453
02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:10.740
Anyway,
it's a track with Jocko helping you.
Okay.
When you go on your path,

2454
02:23:11.010 --> 02:23:14.940
you have moments of weakness.
We all do.
All of us do.

2455
02:23:15.390 --> 02:23:18.000
Even Jocko,
I think,

2456
02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:22.990
but when we,
when I have moments of weakness,
you know,

2457
02:23:23.130 --> 02:23:27.270
if Jack was there to be like,
hey,
look,
not yell.
I want Jacqui yelling at me.

2458
02:23:27.271 --> 02:23:31.020
I don't want anyone yelling.
Really.
Some people do.
I get it.
I respect.

2459
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:35.700
But personally in a lot of us don't want Jocko yelling at us.
No need,

2460
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:40.470
no need.
Right.
Is Not impactful.
Yeah.

2461
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:43.850
It's a short impact.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2462
02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:47.580
And then the galley is kind of like pragmatic telling me like,
oh,

2463
02:23:47.581 --> 02:23:51.660
here's an actual reason why should not mess this workout.
Yup.

2464
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:55.290
And that's exactly what I should not eat this doughnut.
Exactly.
Right.

2465
02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:56.490
That's exactly what it is.

2466
02:23:56.530 --> 02:24:00.390
One of my favorite Twitter things of all time is that little girl from Australia

2467
02:24:00.391 --> 02:24:02.950
saying imitating me saying sugar coated.

2468
02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.990
Good.
Hundred percent.
Good.
Yes.
That's a good one.
Yeah.

2469
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:12.870
Notice you weren't yelling on though.
She kind of made it.

2470
02:24:13.290 --> 02:24:18.240
It's funny the way she heard it was almost like yelling,
you know,

2471
02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:20.430
like she could be shooting are coded.

2472
02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:26.340
Yeah.
Yeah.
Very good.

2473
02:24:26.730 --> 02:24:31.730
Unless it's practical Jocko telling you practically and pragmatically why you

2474
02:24:33.541 --> 02:24:38.541
shouldn't skip to work out why you shouldn't or why procrastination kills you.

2475
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:40.060
So it's like you'll be like,
oh shit.

2476
02:24:40.290 --> 02:24:45.090
It's almost like you gain a deeper understanding of the potential weakness.

2477
02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:50.120
And you can get past it works a hundred percent success rate in my experience.

2478
02:24:50.430 --> 02:24:53.460
Check.
Well also you've got,
if you want,

2479
02:24:53.461 --> 02:24:57.240
you can get some Jocko white tea and you know what?
Sure it tastes good.

2480
02:24:57.241 --> 02:24:59.130
Sure it's got antioxidants in it,
but let's face it,

2481
02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:03.660
there's no other drink that's guaranteeing an 8,000 pound deadlift that no other

2482
02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:07.760
drink.
Not that I know.
No.
So did you get some Jocko white tea,

2483
02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:11.430
get an 8,000 pound deadlift check.
Next question.
A lot of people do.

2484
02:25:11.431 --> 02:25:12.830
You do all kinds of working out.

2485
02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:17.010
They try and try the triple complex to the OB.

2486
02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:19.380
They could come up with these big plants.
Just drink Jocko white tea.

2487
02:25:19.390 --> 02:25:24.080
You're there,
no knees,
no need even play around.
Check a

2488
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:28.870
<v 0>books where the warrior kid,
we talk about staying on the path.
What's the path?</v>

2489
02:25:30.250 --> 02:25:31.510
A lot of people are looking for the path,

2490
02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:36.850
but what if someone could show you the path?
Well,
the,

2491
02:25:37.090 --> 02:25:42.090
the fact is the path can be found and it's simply and clearly put forward to you

2492
02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:48.601
in the way of the warrior kid books of which there are two and they will put

2493
02:25:49.301 --> 02:25:53.830
kids on the right path is the book everyone wishes they had when they were kids.

2494
02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:55.900
Everyone,
everyone that's read it has said to me,

2495
02:25:55.901 --> 02:25:58.810
I wish I had this when I was getting like,
yeah,
me too.
Me Too.
I didn't have it.

2496
02:25:59.830 --> 02:26:04.830
How to just kind of wander around trying to figure out where the path is.

2497
02:26:04.841 --> 02:26:06.370
But no,
you don't need to have that happen.

2498
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:12.250
So a lot of the path has covered in book one,
but now book two is coming out.

2499
02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:16.480
Weigh the war.
Your kid too.
It's called Mark's mission.
More lessons learned,

2500
02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:20.050
controlling your temper,
saving money.

2501
02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.510
How to get people to stop making fun of you.

2502
02:26:22.511 --> 02:26:24.610
That's important to know as a little kid,
right?

2503
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:29.110
Controlling fear of failure because a lot of kids,
you don't think of this.

2504
02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:31.930
When you think of fear of failure,
you think of like an adult that say,

2505
02:26:31.931 --> 02:26:34.870
don't you know,
I don't really for new foot one step out,
man,

2506
02:26:34.871 --> 02:26:36.160
that guy is afraid of failure,

2507
02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:40.060
that that's for kids even more so kids don't even want to try something because

2508
02:26:40.061 --> 02:26:41.140
we're going afraid they're going to look bad.

2509
02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:45.040
I remember my daughter when she was 13 my oldest daughter,

2510
02:26:45.041 --> 02:26:48.640
she was 13 years old and she was kind of interested in someone.
I was like,
well,

2511
02:26:48.641 --> 02:26:51.700
why don't you,
you know,
try it.
And she's like,
I'm too old to start.

2512
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:54.910
She's 13 you know what I mean?

2513
02:26:54.970 --> 02:26:58.240
So how do you get kids to come over that?
Well,
you,

2514
02:26:58.270 --> 02:27:01.570
you introduce them to these books,
building a business,

2515
02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:06.040
that's something that kids don't think about very often.
They should be.

2516
02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:08.680
They should be thinking about starting businesses,

2517
02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:13.060
earning money when they're young.
Learning the value of money when they're young,

2518
02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:16.000
they should absolutely be learned about this book's gonna make every kid better.

2519
02:27:16.270 --> 02:27:20.650
It'll make them a warrior kids.
So here's what you do.
You preorder the book.

2520
02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:24.670
Now that's my recommendation marks mission,
preorder the book.
Now.

2521
02:27:25.090 --> 02:27:28.120
There's a couple reasons why.
Number one,
you don't,

2522
02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:30.400
it's happened with other books that I've come out with.

2523
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:33.250
If you don't order it preorder,
then guess what?

2524
02:27:33.251 --> 02:27:37.090
You go to order and it's not out of stock and then you're mad at me.
Everyone's,

2525
02:27:37.091 --> 02:27:41.050
Ooh,
you're supplied.
Bandwidth is working really well there,
Jocko.
Hey,
okay,

2526
02:27:41.051 --> 02:27:44.590
I'll take ownership of that.
Guess what?
Order the book and you'd have it.

2527
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:49.150
How's that?
That's my recommendation,
so if you ordered,

2528
02:27:49.151 --> 02:27:51.970
the other thing that's good about it is if you order,

2529
02:27:51.971 --> 02:27:56.890
it spreads the word and more kids will hear about it because there's no big

2530
02:27:56.950 --> 02:28:00.790
advertising.
I just got a thing the other day from somebody who was a tool,

2531
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:03.550
a social media,
I think it was Twitter.
You know,

2532
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:04.870
you might want to check with your,

2533
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:07.810
I don't know what your marketing teams telling you,
like,
Hey,

2534
02:28:07.811 --> 02:28:11.350
I don't have a marketing team over here to me and echo,
we're kicking it.

2535
02:28:12.130 --> 02:28:14.890
So if you want to help spread the word order the book,

2536
02:28:14.891 --> 02:28:19.891
it's due out April 24th it's way the warrior kid to Mark's.

2537

And if you want to see a,
an actual warrior kid and action checkout,

2538

2539
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.850
He's only 12 years old but has his own business speaking to businesses.

2540
02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:36.860
You can get his soap that he makes from goat milk.
Very good soap by the way.

2541
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:42.830
It's got a good motto to the motto of the soap is stay clean.
Sounds simple,

2542
02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:46.580
but you know what?
There's a lot of layers there.
