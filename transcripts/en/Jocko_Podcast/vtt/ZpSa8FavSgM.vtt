00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.980
This is Jocko podcast with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.903
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Good Evening Echo bt and tonight's podcast is a little bit different but I think

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.070
it has some good information in it.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I was asked by two people who have outstanding podcasts of their own to sit down

6
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:29.781
and have a conversation about leadership and specifically leadership inside of

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.400
atrocities and when we recorded it,

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.290
I wasn't really expecting it,

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.320
but we decided that we would all release it on our podcast platforms.

10
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.310
So the two people that I recorded this with,

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
our Danieli Bolelli and Daryl Cooper,

12
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.370
unfortunately Echo Charles was not present for this recording

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.030
and Danieli Bolelli.
First of all,
he's a history professor.

14
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.810
He's a martial artist,
he's an author and yes,
he's a podcaster.

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.310
He has two podcasts that are great to listen to.

16
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.490
The great podcast.

17
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.520
One is called the drunk and towers and the other one is history on fire.

18
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.160
They're great podcasts there,
entertaining podcasts,
they're educational,

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.180
they're like I said,

20
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:29.100
they're super informative and the podcast that you're about to listen to is

21
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.260
based on a couple other podcasts.

22
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.010
The first one being bye Daniellie from his history on fire podcast number 32

23
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.660
Alpha 32 a for civilians out there and the podcast is about the sand creek

24
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:47.191
massacre,

25
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:52.191
which took place in present day Kiowa County Colorado on November 29th,

26
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.810
1864 where there were about somewhere between 70 and 170 Cheyenne,

27
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:05.490
Arapaho Indians,
mostly women and children

28
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.110
who were slaughtered by a 675 man force of the Colorado us volunteer cavalry,

29
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.830
brutal situation,

30
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.850
horrible situation and like I said,

31
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.360
Danieli Bilali talks about that on his history on fire podcast number 32 alpha.

32
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.230
The other podcast,

33
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:36.231
this is related to is from Darryl Cooper's podcast has his podcast is called the

34
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:43.440
martyrmade podcast and specifically podcast number 10 it's about the mee Lai

35
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:44.274
massacre

36
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.820
and that is when about 500 innocent civilians.

37
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.151
Again,

38
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:56.151
mostly women and children were murdered and many also raped and mutilated by US

39
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.180
soldiers in Vietnam.

40
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.110
Daryl Cooper is also an incredible podcast,

41
00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:11.111
or he's a great storyteller and he goes through ridiculous,

42
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:17.460
I would say depths to give all perspectives of a story.
And He,

43
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.960
his podcast martyrmade is fantastic.

44
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:23.230
He doesn't put them out off as often as I wish he would.

45
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.850
But the podcasts are great.

46
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.610
The one on the Palestinian Israeli conflict that he started his first,

47
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:33.760
I think it's this first six podcasts on martyrmade.
That's what it's about.

48
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.680
And they're fantastic.

49
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.000
And he's a veteran of the u s navy.
He's a wrestler,

50
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.170
he's a two player and he's really smart,

51
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:46.990
well read person and great to listen to.

52
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.870
And then the last podcast is my own podcast,

53
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.980
Jocko podcast number 31 four hours in me Eli,

54
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.930
which is when I did an assessment of a book by that name and talked about that

55
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:03.931
same massacre in Vietnam and in this podcast that you're about to listen to,

56
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.890
the three of us discuss how these atrocities come about and what can be done to

57
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.270
prevent them in the future.
So that's the lay down.

58
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.213
And here it is,

59
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.690
<v 1>Daniela [inaudible],
everybody.
I'm here.
Daryl Cooper,
uh,</v>

60
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.410
talking to two of my favorite people.
Um,

61
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.630
we're going to go some dark places today.

62
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:33.460
You've listened to the last two podcasts.

63
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:38.461
It's Daniella and I have put out and maybe about 60% of the podcast that Jockos

64
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.570
put out.
Then,
you know,
we're going to,
we're going to dive into some dark places.

65
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.340
Um,
I want to get it started pretty quick.

66
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:49.210
We've been talking beforehand so let's just jump right into it.
Um,

67
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.520
Daniella and I recently did a series that we uh,

68
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.440
cooperated on where he covered the sand creek massacre in 1864 some US army

69
00:04:56.441 --> 00:05:01.270
soldiers,
uh,
massacred some native Americans in Colorado.
Um,

70
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:03.310
I did them Eli massacre,
um,

71
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.200
similar situation 104 years later in the jungles of Vietnam.
Um,

72
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.000
we're fortunate enough to be here with Jocko.
If you don't know who Jocko is a,

73
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.300
I guess we'll go ahead and let you introduce yourself just a little bit.

74
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.370
<v 0>Yeah,
my name is Jocko Willink.</v>

75
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:24.371
Guy Was in the military for 20 years and retired in 2010 and now I written a

76
00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:30.950
couple books and have a podcast called Jocko podcast.

77
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:35.720
Cause I don't get really creative with the names of things.

78
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.410
So

79
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.420
<v 1>jacos pretty direct about things.
So I,
he's also kind of humble.</v>

80
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:41.900
Jocko is a navy seal commander in Iraq.

81
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.970
He led taskforce bruiser is that right into a task unit bruiser bruiser into the

82
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.710
battle of Ramadi.
If you know anything about,
uh,
the war in Iraq,
you know,

83
00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:55.760
the battle of Ramadi in the battle of Fallujah are probably the two big fights

84
00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:58.070
that get mentioned the most.
We're asked.

85
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:03.071
Volusia was more of an more of a direct assault on the city after,

86
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:04.244
uh,

87
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.260
after the insurgents captured and tortured and mutilated some US contractors in

88
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.910
Bush ordered the Marines to retaliate.

89
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:13.180
The battle of Ramadi was a little bit different.
Uh,

90
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.910
Jack was going to talk a little bit about the environment that they went into,

91
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:17.810
uh,
going into it.

92
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:20.810
And so he's got some military experience not only being on the ground,

93
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:25.811
but of leading men in battle in an environment and insurgent war where you've

94
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.450
got different groups of people,
different sex,

95
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:34.190
the Sunni and the Shia Anorak who were fighting a bloody battle that we're in

96
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:38.630
the middle of.
But who we can engage with on their level.
You know,

97
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.160
these are people who are fighting a very,

98
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.610
very dirty and ugly war against one another.
And against us,

99
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:48.140
if they get their hands on us as Americans,
I'm going into a war like that.

100
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.340
You know,
we've got,

101
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.730
we've got a different mentality and we try to avoid behaving in ways that

102
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:53.920
dishonor us.
And,
uh,

103
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.590
it's something that Jocko takes very seriously and he had to let lead men into

104
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:00.830
combat under those conditions.
So we can talk about that.
It was 2006,

105
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:04.880
April of 2006 when you lead,
you met into Ramadi to begin with,
is that right?

106
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.750
Yes,
that's what it was.
So,
uh,
shortly before that,

107
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.770
a couple of months before the golden dome of the Alis scarred mosque was blown

108
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:16.490
up by al Qaeda in Iraq.
Zarqawi is people,
this is an ancient,

109
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.530
she a mosque,
one of the most sacred places to s to Shia Islam.

110
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.670
<v 0>Well,
well,
interestingly,
Ramadi was,
is primarily Sunni.
In fact,</v>

111
00:07:26.671 --> 00:07:30.090
it's almost all SUNY.
And interestingly,

112
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.990
the majority of the military forces in Iraq,

113
00:07:33.991 --> 00:07:36.260
especially the army were where she,
uh,

114
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.190
and so you had to kind of diffuse that tension on a pretty regular basis to make

115
00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:43.080
sure that there weren't,
you know,

116
00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:47.040
reprisal killings and the,

117
00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:52.041
there was definitely some level of mistrust between the Sunni's that lived there

118
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:59.330
in the city and the Shia military.
But it's definitely,
it's,

119
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:03.810
it's absolutely,
it was absolutely clear that the,

120
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.460
the Sunni's that lived in Ramadi,
the local Sunni's that lived in Ramadi,

121
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.120
much preferred the Shia army soldiers to the insurgents that were there that

122
00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:20.070
were being run by al Qaeda in Iraq by Zarqawi and the likes.

123
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.400
And because what they were doing was just savagery and you know,

124
00:08:25.801 --> 00:08:29.970
everything that you hear about,
they were skinning people alive.

125
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.080
They were beheading whole families.
They were torturing,
raping,
and murdering,

126
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.140
murdering the local populace in to get them to support them as much as they

127
00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:44.400
could through pure terror.
And so the local populace,

128
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.360
even though they might not have been,
you know,
they're,

129
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.780
they're basically going with who's their worst enemy at the time.

130
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.110
Their worst enemy at the time was without question al Qaeda in Iraq.

131
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.650
And so the she army that was there to fight al Qaeda in Iraq,

132
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.270
the Sunni's or we're generally in support of what the army was doing there.

133
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.104
So it was,

134
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.050
it was a little bit different than in areas like solder city where the,
the,

135
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.200
she is in solder city,
we're very active.

136
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.290
There was an active fight going on against coalition forces.

137
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.220
So yeah,
it's uh,
it's definitely a tricky situation

138
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.520
<v 1>when you,</v>

139
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.120
when you roll into a situation like that with American soldiers where both sides

140
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:31.890
are engaged in just a hurricane of atrocities across the country and where the

141
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:32.850
people who are there,

142
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.300
they might be looking to you for safety or I guess that's a question I would

143
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:39.570
have a,
they probably under the circumstances where the people in the city,

144
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:41.520
I mean they probably were looking to you to protect them.

145
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.000
<v 0>Absolutely.
And just before we showed up,
just to,</v>

146
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.330
just to kind of paint this as clear as I can and,

147
00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:50.090
and I forget the exact numbers and I apologize for that,

148
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.190
but just before we showed up,

149
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.220
the insurgents murdered,

150
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.420
it was something like seven,
eight,

151
00:09:59.421 --> 00:10:04.421
nine 10 of the leading tribal shakes in the area and the tribal shakes that

152
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:07.730
survived for that left,
they left.

153
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.900
And so that just put the whole,
the whole city,

154
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.340
you know,

155
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:18.340
under such a grip of fear of the insurgence that they just basically surrendered

156
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.920
as much as you can surrender,
which means,
hey,

157
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.680
if you want to come and stay at my house and you want to sit in my backyard and

158
00:10:24.681 --> 00:10:26.090
launch mortars at the coalition forces,

159
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:28.520
we're not going to say anything to you because we're going to,
we want to live,

160
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.520
we don't want to get killed.
And that's what you end up with.

161
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:34.220
You end up with passive support.
And that's what the locals were doing.

162
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.020
They were passively supporting the insurgents only because they didn't want to

163
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:43.760
have their heads cut off.
And so as we,

164
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.590
and this was a brilliant strategy that was spearheaded by the one one AED,

165
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:48.891
the,

166
00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:53.300
the ready First Brigade of the First Armored Division run by a guy named Colonel

167
00:10:53.301 --> 00:10:55.100
Sean Mcfarlin,
who ended up being a general,

168
00:10:55.101 --> 00:10:59.690
and he's a brilliant guy and a great leader,
but you know,
his eye,

169
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.830
his attitude,
which he actually got from HR McMaster,

170
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:08.810
which he had employed up in California and uh,
one,

171
00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:12.140
one 80 had actually gone into telephone and gotten a turnover and understood

172
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:13.780
what they had done up and Telefonica.
And,

173
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.860
and the strategy was called cs clear hold and build,

174
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.890
which was going to be his enemy controlled territory's these Enderby controlled

175
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:23.360
neighborhoods and stay there.
And so that's what,
that's what the strategy was.

176
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.420
And that was a lot different then the strategy that had been being used up until

177
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:30.920
this point,
not just in Ramadi button,
all of Iraq.

178
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.700
<v 1>Is that a strategy that's,
um,
it almost seems like looking at it,</v>

179
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.680
reading about Ramadi from the outside of somebody who's never been in combat.

180
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.600
It almost seems like the goal was to go in there and establish your dominance

181
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:44.290
over the city,

182
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.400
almost to show the people of the city that you don't have to be afraid of these

183
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:50.830
people because they're afraid of us and we're going to,

184
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.510
we have freedom in this city.

185
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:56.740
We can take our Humvees and patrol the streets and they're not going to come out

186
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.680
and fight us because they're afraid of us.
And so you don't have to fear them.

187
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:01.630
It almost seems like that was the goal there.

188
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.390
<v 2>Yeah.
I wouldn't use the word dominance because we weren't trying to dominate the</v>

189
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:09.300
local populace.
We were trying to provide security for the local populous.

190
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.740
And obviously that's a big difference because when you start having an attitude

191
00:12:12.741 --> 00:12:14.510
of we're going to dominate the local populace,

192
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.920
that that's just a small step in the wrong direction.
Right?

193
00:12:18.921 --> 00:12:21.890
That's a small step in the wrong direction.
Whereas saying,
Hey,

194
00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:25.550
we're here to protect and secure and stabilize the local populace,
that is,

195
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.200
that is what we were doing.

196
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.320
<v 1>Yeah.
I think it took us maybe a little bit longer than we wish it would have to.</v>

197
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:36.110
Uh,
recognize that before you can do anything counterinsurgency,

198
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.640
you have to provide security to the people.
Hundred percent.

199
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.880
You're not leaving them a choice,

200
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:43.000
then they're going to provide that passive support.
Right.
And I think

201
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.320
<v 2>that's one of the issues that shows up with the kind of happy oats.
We did the,</v>

202
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.560
you know,
both the story of Sand Creek and story off me,
Eli,

203
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.450
you have a c to a shooting,
which sad than the some guys making to Luke,

204
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.410
everybody on the quote unquote their side as belonging to the same field,

205
00:12:58.411 --> 00:13:01.830
the Hawaii because they are all Cheyenne or they are old Vietnamese,

206
00:13:01.831 --> 00:13:05.640
they are all,
there's no signs that they are not all in the same boat.

207
00:13:05.641 --> 00:13:08.010
Some people are your allies,
some people are your enemies.

208
00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:09.690
Some people are exactly what you are saying.

209
00:13:09.691 --> 00:13:13.140
Stacking between where I kind of have to cooperate with your enemies,

210
00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:16.950
not because I want to buy because I really have no other choice and you cannot

211
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:21.030
treat all of them the same way.
And so I think the dilemma you're facing,

212
00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:22.890
these idea of having to figure out,
okay,

213
00:13:22.891 --> 00:13:24.750
there are people that worry or to protect.

214
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.460
Those are not the people we're going after.

215
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.430
There are other people that we need to take care of.

216
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.930
That seems to be one of the scenes.
There was Betty much missing,

217
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.830
you know that nuance,

218
00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:38.250
that ability to look at people who may look the same way but they are not the

219
00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:41.220
same people to look at them it with different eyes.

220
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.580
That seemed to be really well was me seeing some of the stories.

221
00:13:44.581 --> 00:13:49.581
Now we've treated where the guys who did what they did is because to dam is like

222
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.180
an Indian,
he's an Indian,
Vietnamese,
Vietnamese,
whatever.
It's all the same,

223
00:13:54.181 --> 00:13:58.110
doesn't really matter and I think he's like ow.

224
00:13:58.111 --> 00:14:03.111
Do you see one leads to that point on one side and vice versa?

225
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:07.080
What is the you guys were doing to make sure that it doesn't go to that point

226
00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:11.880
where your guys would not make that switch to that frame of mind and keeping

227
00:14:11.881 --> 00:14:15.690
their priorities very clear in terms of differentiating in terms of who they are

228
00:14:15.691 --> 00:14:17.850
facing.
Real quick,
can I just add up

229
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.310
<v 1>supplement to that question?</v>

230
00:14:19.311 --> 00:14:24.290
Cause that's kind of what I wanted to ask as well as,
uh,
how do you,

231
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.260
how do you train your men and lead your men in such a way that they can pull the

232
00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:35.200
trigger when they have to and when civilians get killed on,
you know,

233
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.350
accidentally that that doesn't destroy them emotionally.
Right?

234
00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:43.460
There's gotta be some kind of separation there without having them fully enter

235
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:44.930
over into that mindset that Danielle,

236
00:14:44.931 --> 00:14:49.070
he's talking about where you're just dehumanizing the enemy all together when

237
00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:51.230
you have to lead your men in a situation like that.
Like how,
how did,

238
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.160
how did you deal with that?

239
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.110
<v 0>Yeah.
Well this is leadership.
This is leadership and this is leadership in war.</v>

240
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.740
And this is,
you know,
this,
this question that you're asking is the,
is the,

241
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.190
you know,

242
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:06.190
one of the largest possible questions you could ask about combat leadership and

243
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.940
you know,
you,
I appreciate that you guys keep referring to me,
but I was,

244
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.180
I had 35 or 40 seals there depending on the time and there was 5,600 soldiers

245
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:22.820
and marines that were there that were discriminating targets every single day

246
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.760
and that had outstanding leadership that we're,

247
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.690
that we're making sure that guys with less training than my guys,

248
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:31.040
guys that were younger than my guys,

249
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.480
guys that had a tougher job than my guys in many cases would still discriminate

250
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:37.010
targets and make sure that they were,

251
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.360
were engaging enemy personnel and not civilians.

252
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.100
Now I'm certainly not saying that civilians didn't get killed because civilians

253
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:48.380
got killed and it's an awful thing.

254
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.230
And one of the things I talk about all the time,

255
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:54.710
if you go to war and you're not comfortable with the fact that you're going to

256
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:57.950
kill innocent people,
then you probably don't have the will to go to war.

257
00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:02.000
And maybe what you're going to war for isn't,

258
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.550
doesn't meet the threshold of what warrants a war.

259
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.790
And if that's what the conclusion you come to,
that's fine.
You know,

260
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.520
let's hope you come to it before you've,

261
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.090
before you've be on before you're on the ground and,
and blood has been spilled.

262
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.720
But there's so many little things to that.

263
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:23.270
Would,
that would,
that,
you know,
that we'd cover to talk about me.
I mean,

264
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:26.530
just even the distinction that I just made between like,
hey,
we're,

265
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.290
we're going in there to dominate.
That's a little step.

266
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.240
It's one little step and using that word and then following it up.

267
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.670
And we talked a little bit about this and,
and Daryl,

268
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.740
I was listen to your podcast about the meal.
I'm asking her and I,

269
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:42.830
and I did one about it as well.
And one of the things that,
that really,

270
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.540
that I talked about in pretty great depth,
because for me,
I had,

271
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:52.250
I had incredible correlate correlation between what happened in me life and what

272
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:55.550
I sometimes saw happen overseas.

273
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.310
And that was with the intelligence that you're receiving.

274
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.650
And you could see,
and I pointed it out in my podcast and I,

275
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.250
I don't remember like all the exact verbiage,
but you know,

276
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.620
at the senior levels of intelligence,

277
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.160
the intelligence report was that pink Ville or the area of Pinkville or me lie,

278
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.500
whatever you want to call it,
me lie for that,
that area,
the,

279
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.600
the initial intelligence was suspected Vietnamese in the or suspected Viet Cong,

280
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.840
uh,
area could be possible,
you know,

281
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.940
Vietcong.

282
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.790
And then it went down one level in the chain of command and the next people that

283
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:41.480
briefed it,
it was,
you know,
just a little bit stronger.
You know,
it was

284
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.880
v,
you know,
Vietcong area,
Vietcong controlled area,

285
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:50.990
and then it went down one more level and it was Viet Cong,
uh,

286
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.500
headquarters area.
And then it got down to,
this is all Vietcong.

287
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.020
And then they threw in the,
the fact that,
you know,
the,

288
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.160
the,
the people go into the market,
right?
It's market day.
You know,

289
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.970
that started off as,
hey,
some people will be at the market on this day.

290
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.290
And by the time it got to the guys on the ground it was every one that's good is

291
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:14.190
going to be at the market.

292
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.830
Everyone that's still in the village is going to be bad.

293
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.570
They're going to be VC and well you know what to do with VC.

294
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.410
<v 2>Yeah.
What'd he say is,</v>

295
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.220
he said really interesting in terms of just human communication.
Oh,
in that case,

296
00:18:27.221 --> 00:18:30.280
before you even go about Americans and Vietnamese,

297
00:18:30.281 --> 00:18:34.960
you even discuss who are or lead.
Just the basics of human communication.

298
00:18:34.961 --> 00:18:39.961
Now sometime starting one degree off before you know it,

299
00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:41.560
if you keep it long enough,

300
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:45.580
the one degree off to Q so far off course from the reality they are trying to

301
00:18:45.581 --> 00:18:49.480
describe that the wards switch,
he's kind of like playing telephone.

302
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:51.790
You know when you,
we spare something in the other person's here.

303
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.400
It doesn't sound that different from what you just third by.

304
00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:58.240
You just tweak just tiny beat by the time you're down 20 people.

305
00:18:58.241 --> 00:19:01.540
The message as no similarity whatsoever to the original,

306
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.830
the one and it seems like that as I think we do.

307
00:19:05.831 --> 00:19:09.040
We told the time in daily life,
but nobody dies as a result of it.

308
00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:11.650
Whereas in that Chi kind of scenario,
people do die.

309
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.420
The consequences are so much more dramatic as a result of that.

310
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.460
<v 0>And what's interesting is,
and Darryl,</v>

311
00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:23.960
you kind of brought up in your podcast and and you did as well,
Daniel,

312
00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:27.470
is how does this happen?
Right?
How does this happen?

313
00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:32.471
Because if you take a normal human being and you drop them into the middle of

314
00:19:33.321 --> 00:19:36.920
that thing,
they look around and they go,
what the hell is happening?
Which is,

315
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.130
which is actually what happened when,
uh,
when,
uh,

316
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.380
Hugh Thompson came in his helicopter,
he dropped into this situation and said,

317
00:19:45.381 --> 00:19:49.130
what the Hell's going on here?
This is totally wrong.
Uh,

318
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:53.660
but as you're,
as you're getting there,
if you're not on that trip,

319
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.930
if you're not on that train as it's going off the rails,
you,

320
00:19:56.931 --> 00:19:57.890
you don't recognize it.

321
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.490
And that's why one thing I talk about all the time from a leadership perspective

322
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:06.730
is the ability to detach from all the chaos and all the mayhem that's happening.

323
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.480
Because if you don't have to,

324
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.380
if you don't have the ability to detach from that chaos,
you're in it.

325
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.660
And if you're in the chaos as a leader,

326
00:20:14.661 --> 00:20:16.730
you don't see the mayhem that's happening.

327
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.050
And so it's so important for a leader in the business world,

328
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.010
but certainly in the military,
to be able or in any leadership position,

329
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.440
to be able to step back and,

330
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.210
and observe what's actually happening from a detached perspective because

331
00:20:32.211 --> 00:20:37.130
otherwise you're in the storm and that is not a good place to be as a leader.

332
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.490
<v 2>You've got to have rules for how you're going to behave before,</v>

333
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.780
while you're going into it.
Because if you just,
you know,

334
00:20:41.781 --> 00:20:46.160
if you're going to react to everything on the ground once you arrive,
uh,

335
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.720
I mean it's always expedient to just shoot them.
You know,

336
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:54.721
at the time it's always easier and safer probably to just do the easy thing and

337
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:59.730
be violent or whatever.
So you have to have rules going into it.
Um,
did you,

338
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.480
I guess one thing that I want,

339
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.730
because the poetry of bidding stuff is super interesting,

340
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:07.180
but I think essentially what you're saying is that the person in a position of

341
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:10.750
leadership needs to be as that master.
You know,

342
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:15.190
they need to be in the middle of emotions that clearly are affecting everyone

343
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:19.360
around them and they are bombarded day are getting bombarded windows,
emotions.

344
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:22.150
They need to be completely detached from this stuff.

345
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.000
It makes perfect sense.

346
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.660
Outer you do it cause it's a hell of a lot easier said than done clearly.

347
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.100
And I would do people even terrain to get to that place

348
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.250
<v 0>so well for one thing,</v>

349
00:21:35.251 --> 00:21:37.650
when I was running the training for the west coast seal teams,

350
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.540
I would fire up that training to a point that it was,

351
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.890
there was total temptation for the leaders to get wrapped into the scenarios

352
00:21:46.891 --> 00:21:48.480
that I was developing for them.

353
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.590
There'd be total mayhem and if they let it happen they would get wrapped up in

354
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:56.190
these horrible scenarios mentally,
emotionally they'd be mad.

355
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.100
They'd be mad at me cause I was the guy that was running the training.

356
00:21:59.101 --> 00:22:03.180
They'd be mad at the opposing force roleplayers they'd be mad at their guys.

357
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.630
They'd start yelling and screaming.
They'd make bad decisions and,

358
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.660
and I wanted them to get there because I wanted them to see what happens when

359
00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:14.880
you get wrapped up in this stuff emotionally.
So,

360
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.750
and then what I would do is teach them that they have certain,

361
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.460
what I would call red flags,

362
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.900
certain certain signals that they need to learn how to pick up.

363
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.780
If you feel yourself start raising your voice,

364
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.280
well then that probably indicates that you might get be getting emotional if

365
00:22:32.281 --> 00:22:34.650
you're breathing heavy,
if your fists are clenched.

366
00:22:34.651 --> 00:22:38.490
There's all these things that you start to recognize and once you can recognize

367
00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:43.200
them and you say,
okay,
I'm starting to get emotional right now,
need to step back.

368
00:22:43.201 --> 00:22:44.430
Now,
interestingly,

369
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.530
what I would often do an easy methodology for training these guys was first of

370
00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:53.040
all,
stop looking down the sides of your weapon like you.
You're not allowed to.

371
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.181
And we'd give,

372
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:57.300
we'd give a liter of stick if we had to and take their guns away so that they

373
00:22:57.301 --> 00:22:58.230
weren't going to be shooting.

374
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.260
They weren't going to be wrapped up in that tactical situation and literally put

375
00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:08.910
that weapon at high port and step back away from the firing line.

376
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.620
You know,
Kelly Kelly is with his m 16 gunning people down.

377
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:18.180
He's completely wrapped up in what's happening.
Medina's yelling and screaming.

378
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.270
I mean I talk about this with,
with police forces as well.

379
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.720
If you want to hear people go listen to some of the bad shootings that you hear

380
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.690
and police have a incredibly hard job.

381
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.270
They need way more training.

382
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:38.160
But go listen to some of those shootings that take place and listen to the pitch

383
00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:42.670
and the tone of the officer if and,
and what are they doing?
They're saying,
God,

384
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.500
I'm good to get out there.
They're completely emotional,
right?

385
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.340
And that emotion is going to drive bad decision making.

386
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.070
So you have to learn how to detach.

387
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.300
The way you do it is in a way I would initially teach guys to do it is by

388
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.150
physically putting their weapon at high port,

389
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:04.210
stepping back away from the actual firing line and look moving their head around

390
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:09.410
and looking around.
You know?
So Bob Story I wrote about an extreme ownership is,

391
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.230
you know,
we,
I had w w the,
the Delta platoon commander who's a great guy,

392
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.160
smart guy,
you know,
Ivy League,
Naval Academy and just,
just a,

393
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.570
a brilliant guy,
great guy.
And he was,

394
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:28.460
we were doing some training and it was in Humvees and we were doing immediate

395
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:30.170
action drills and Humvees here out in the desert.

396
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.350
And you're shoot targets pop up and you engage the targets.
It's like,

397
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.010
it's like being mini tank commanders and you've got five vehicles,

398
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:39.680
you've got to maneuver them on the battlefield while they'd provide cover fire

399
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:41.990
for each other.
And it's,
it's a little bit chaotic.

400
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:43.700
There's big machine guns shooting.
And,

401
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.470
and when I was going with him and I was sitting behind him,

402
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:52.280
observing him do this,
and every time the shooting we started,

403
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:54.770
he would kind of lock up,
right?
He'd kind of like lock up.

404
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.670
There's so much happening that he wasn't processing it quick enough.

405
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.480
And so I took a sharpie magic marker and I,
and I,

406
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:06.590
and I wrote down on the window in front of his face,

407
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.560
I wrote Haggai,
here's what I want you to do.
And when,
when the shooting starts,

408
00:25:09.561 --> 00:25:10.910
I want you to this one,

409
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.020
relax to look around three make a call.

410
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.790
And at that time I hadn't thought through this stuff as much as I have now

411
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:21.530
because I've been doing it for much longer.

412
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:26.810
But what I was telling him to do was detached from what's happening and the way

413
00:25:26.811 --> 00:25:29.600
you do that,
as you relax,
you look around and,

414
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.680
and then you get on the the radio and you make a call and you know the next run

415
00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:36.350
I watched him and I was sitting behind him and I'm looking over his shoulder and

416
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.300
once the shooting starts,
you can't hear anything.

417
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.950
So I'm just just watching him and I,

418
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.890
I see him the shooting stars and I seen him look at the window and I seen him

419
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:44.570
take a deep breath and exhale and I was like,
okay.

420
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:47.540
He just relaxed and I see his head start to turn and I realize,
okay,

421
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:49.730
now he's looking around and,
and that,

422
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.560
those two simple items were enough to make him detach from all that chaos,

423
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.130
actually assess what is happening and then make a good decision.

424
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.300
And so that is one of the most important things that you can train a leader to

425
00:26:02.301 --> 00:26:04.370
do.
Sounds like coaching a Jujitsu white belt.

426
00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.210
First thing you tell them they're on the ground getting beat on and they kind
of,

427
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.220
firstly you tell him,
breathe,
breathe,
relax.
Until you can do that,

428
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.300
then nothing's gonna work.
Yeah,
it's one of those,
it's one of those things to,

429
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.960
people talk about like breathing exercises.

430
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.650
And one thing that I would instinctively do,

431
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:28.370
and it's another thing that I would train my guys to do was like,

432
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.790
you don't panic on the radio.
You don't yell on the radio,

433
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:35.420
you don't scream on the radio.
You,
no matter what's going on,

434
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:39.860
when you get on the radio you say,
you know,
bruiser one six,
this is bruiser over.

435
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.340
I mean that's,
that's what you do.
And in order to do that,

436
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.000
you have to relax you.
So it forces you.

437
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.610
If you're not going to sound panicked on the radio,
which,

438
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.400
which if you sound panicked on the radio and,
and your team,
here's it,
guess what?

439
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:59.310
You're going to have panic going on.
So you have to,
it's another,

440
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.870
it's another method to detach.
So when you hear your voice getting excited,

441
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:04.291
when you know,

442
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:07.980
when you read about Lieutenant Calley yelling and you hear about Medina yelling,

443
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:09.810
uh,
that,
that,
you know,

444
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.780
Kelly started yelling likely because Medina was yelling at him.

445
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.150
And now that's what happens.
We're just,

446
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.040
we're just sending that panic through the chain of command and it's a,

447
00:27:18.041 --> 00:27:19.320
it's a horrible,
horrible thing.

448
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.990
<v 2>I think what's fascinating about it is that even through the scenario you</v>

449
00:27:23.991 --> 00:27:26.890
artists,
could I be any him,
the 99% of the people,

450
00:27:26.891 --> 00:27:30.070
at least sitting 99% of the human beings would never have to deal with because

451
00:27:30.071 --> 00:27:31.420
they are never going to be in combat,

452
00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.880
which bullets flying all around them and all of that.

453
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.720
And yet it's easy to forget the deceived dynamics that are at play in most

454
00:27:39.731 --> 00:27:44.410
people lives in ways that they may be able to recognize in wheat last six stream

455
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:49.510
consequences.
But like when you're a parent and you have your kids going wild,

456
00:27:49.511 --> 00:27:51.900
then suddenly you find yourself,
you know,

457
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.900
raising your voice and starting to yell at them and not the cause.

458
00:27:55.901 --> 00:27:58.720
I mean there's a time and a place sometime is the right thing to do is to kind

459
00:27:58.721 --> 00:28:00.940
of call them on their stuff in harsh ways.

460
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:05.350
But there's a defendant's between raising your voice with any intent and raising

461
00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:08.770
your voice because you are losing it and you're getting overly emotional and

462
00:28:08.771 --> 00:28:12.590
they're getting angry and Keats realize it and they way leader you.
They,

463
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.530
we have to see how you are losing your stuff.

464
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.730
They will see how you are less of a credible presence in their life that they

465
00:28:18.731 --> 00:28:23.140
not can count on you that way because you are a rocket in your own emotions and

466
00:28:23.141 --> 00:28:26.740
you know they press a little button and you go off sometime they'll press that

467
00:28:26.741 --> 00:28:30.100
button because they enjoy seeing you go off sometimes.
But you know,

468
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.950
the point is you're not a good leader as a parent.

469
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.520
<v 0>And it's the same thing.
I mean,
my company now,</v>

470
00:28:35.521 --> 00:28:39.150
we work with businesses all over the world and it's the same exact thing.

471
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.100
And I teach the same exact thing.
If you're starting to get mad at your employee,

472
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:45.540
you're starting to get mad at your subordinates.

473
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:47.190
If you're starting to get mad at your boss,

474
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.280
what should you be doing as a good leader?
You should be detaching.

475
00:28:50.281 --> 00:28:53.520
Taking a step back,
I've told people,
hey,
if you start feeling that way,

476
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.640
you stand up from the meeting table.
Just,
just,
you know,
no one's going to say,

477
00:28:56.641 --> 00:29:00.060
Hey,
what are you doing?
You just,
you know,
stand up,
stretch out,
step back away.

478
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.060
These people are having a heated argument and you start getting involved in it

479
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.390
instead of getting involved in it.
Take a step back.
By the way,
when you do that,

480
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:09.270
you look like a tactical genius because everyone else has started to lose their

481
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:11.400
temper.
They were starting to say things that they shouldn't say.

482
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.400
And you're the one that's listening.

483
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.770
I just just covered a book.
Um,
and,
and just,

484
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:23.520
just like a little thing is if,
if there's,
if you're talking,

485
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:27.600
I'm going to let you talk because if I let you talk,
I know twice as much as you,

486
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.580
I know everything that you know and I know everything that I know,

487
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.500
so I'm going to win that tactical situation.
Um,
I,

488
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:36.030
to come back to what you were just saying,
Daniella,
about leadership as a parent,

489
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.950
it ties into something he was talking about a few minutes ago with like a police

490
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.130
officer who's panicking.

491
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.460
<v 1>We were mentioning this on the car ride over here about police shootings.</v>

492
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:46.330
Like more often than not,

493
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:50.410
what you see is that they're the result of incompetence.
They're the result of,

494
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.950
um,
uh,
socially inept cop who can't manage the situation.

495
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.930
And it's not an easy situation to manage.

496
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:58.930
You've got a potentially dangerous person,
you don't know them,

497
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:02.440
and maybe they're lightly resisting you just verbally.

498
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.840
And you've got to take control of that situation.
Well,

499
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:09.841
unless you're an exceptionally competent and confident person may be the only

500
00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:14.620
tool you have to bring that person under control is your baton or whatever it
is.

501
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:18.100
And,
um,
you get the impression in Vietnam,

502
00:30:18.101 --> 00:30:21.970
especially once you get up to 68,
69 where you know,

503
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:26.320
they're starting to just throw junior officers and right out of ROTC and just

504
00:30:26.321 --> 00:30:30.190
throwing them into combat and you hear,
uh,
stories about,
you know,

505
00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:31.270
officer's getting fragged.

506
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.140
You start to hear stories about Cali washed out ocs three,
three times,
right?

507
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.460
And you,
uh,

508
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.780
you get these people now into a situation where you have a military unit that

509
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:44.620
recognizes they're incompetent leadership and they're scared.

510
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.960
They feel incompetent themselves as a unit.
Um,

511
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.860
and you get them into a place where,

512
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.220
and maybe this is something that you can contrast really well because you dealt,

513
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.260
you led primarily,
uh,
seals and marines,
right?
Seals joke.
It just hits you.

514
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.800
And you worked a lot with marines,
marines and army soldiers as well.
Okay.
Yeah.

515
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:08.080
Mostly there's one battalion of marines in inside Ramadi.
Okay.

516
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:11.630
The three,
eight marines.
Awesome.
When you're dealing with,
uh,

517
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.300
the American military today and,
and I know,
I mean,
um,

518
00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.460
something that gets lost on a lot of people is that,
uh,

519
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.330
as highly trained and motivated and all those things as our special forces are,

520
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.110
uh,
you know,
they're very specialized.
You guys are,
you know,
trained for very,

521
00:31:26.111 --> 00:31:28.420
very specific intense missions and stuff,

522
00:31:28.421 --> 00:31:33.340
but you go pull an average ranger or marine or something or,
or infantry men,
uh,

523
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.560
you put them in combat with good leadership.

524
00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:38.770
And that is a unbelievably effective soldier.
I mean,

525
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:41.230
American soldiers today are all volunteer force.

526
00:31:41.231 --> 00:31:44.770
These are incredibly well trained and motivated people if you know,

527
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:47.680
as if they have the proper leadership.
Uh,
when,

528
00:31:47.681 --> 00:31:50.230
when you get back into a situation like that with Vietnam,

529
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:54.190
where you get a whole unit in that situation that,
that cops in,

530
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.050
where they're in maybe a village,

531
00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.310
they don't exactly know how to handle this situation without resorting to lethal

532
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:01.144
force.

533
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.850
And they start to feel threatened and everything runs off the rails.
You know,

534
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.940
it's,
it's unrealistic to expect,
just like,
uh,
you know,

535
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.870
you're happily married man,
and you don't want to cheat on your wife.

536
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.420
Then when you're off on a business trip,
uh,

537
00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:20.390
after you've had a few drinks with the coworker that's on travel with you,
um,

538
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.100
it seems innocuous.
Maybe it's totally innocent at the time.

539
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:28.660
Don't go upstairs to the hotel to watch a movie because if you get to that
point,

540
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.740
you're just putting yourself in a terrible position.
Right?
And,
and in an a,

541
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:34.000
in that military context,

542
00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:39.001
the idea that all of the built up momentum behind something like me lie,

543
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.850
the idea that you're going to get right up to that moment on March 16th,

544
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:48.850
1968 where the only thing that's stopping it from happening is a few pounds a

545
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:51.580
trigger pull.
That's the last bit of,
you know,

546
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.910
that's your last opportunity to avert this catastrophe is just that few pounds a

547
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:58.120
trigger pull.
Good luck with that.
You know,

548
00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.650
that's something that you can't let it get to that point.

549
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.010
And that was something that,
uh,
and then I'll let you guys take it over.

550
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:06.980
But I wanted to talk about something that it was fascinating to me that you

551
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:07.611
picked up on.

552
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:11.200
As soon as I said the word establish dominance on the streets or Ramadi reacted

553
00:33:11.201 --> 00:33:13.970
against that.
And you're right,
that's incredibly important.

554
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:17.390
And it ties into what you were just talking about,
about you would make people,

555
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.751
uh,

556
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:21.590
either back away from the situation or stop looking down the sites of their gun.

557
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.560
Because when you're looking at a person down the sights of your gun,

558
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.790
it's your framing of the situation and you have him put down their gun and now

559
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:32.810
it's just a person.
It's not a target.
It's not anything like that.
Uh,

560
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:36.590
if you got a bunch of people going into Ramadi and they're thinking in terms of

561
00:33:36.591 --> 00:33:40.460
our is to go establish dominance on the streets of the city,
well,

562
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:44.270
you're framing that in a way that under the right circumstances could,
uh,

563
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.380
you know,
lead to trouble.

564
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.690
And so framing it seems like is what you're talking about.

565
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.440
<v 0>And,</v>

566
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.440
and I also want to make it perfectly clear that if the soldiers,

567
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:58.490
marines,
seals that we work with in the battle of Ramadi,

568
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.370
if they didn't dominate the street as we move down it,

569
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.330
you know,
we would be just be,
oh,
we be killed.
So there is,

570
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.590
the job is even harder than I made it out to say to be,
because I don't,

571
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.920
I w I wouldn't want to use the word dominate the city of Ramadi,

572
00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:19.340
but you're damn right,
we're going to dominate the space that we go into.

573
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.790
And we're going to do that by being very,
very aggressive.

574
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:27.080
And so there is this fine line,
and by the way,
you'd go into a,

575
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.250
you kick a kick a door in,
in Ramadi,
and there's,

576
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.190
there's gunfire in the street that you're on.

577
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.380
You'd kick in a door and there would be a,

578
00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.670
a mom and a dad and a couple of kids and there'd be a normal household with

579
00:34:40.671 --> 00:34:44.310
green grass and a soccer balls.
And that would happen that,

580
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.610
that's what the city was filled with.
And so the,

581
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.510
the fact that these guys,
you know,

582
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.980
were able to flip that switch over and over and over again was,

583
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.380
was amazing.
And it's a,
it's a testament to,

584
00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.830
to the military forces that we have and to the leadership.

585
00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.900
I want to give equal credit to both.
But to your point about,

586
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.660
hey,
you know me lie,
these were draftees.

587
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.840
There was hundreds of thousands of draftees that went over there and did an

588
00:35:14.451 --> 00:35:18.020
incredible job.
They were well led,
that stood up when people win,

589
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:19.820
when the wrong things were happening.

590
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.570
So this was a horrible scenario.

591
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.580
<v 1>Daniella,
let's follow up on that then.
I mean,
that's,</v>

592
00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:29.160
cause that's what's the difference?
Like what happens,
um,

593
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.530
you didn't get all the psychopaths in the army and round them up into one unit,

594
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.960
right?
Um,
by all accounts,
the guys at me lie,
uh,

595
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:39.511
<v 2>talked to the,</v>

596
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:43.080
they were the type of people that when the folks back in Kansas heard about what

597
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:43.471
happened,

598
00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:46.360
they couldn't believe that little Johnny would ever do anything like that.

599
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.100
Same thing at Sand Creek.
Right.
Same thing.
And so

600
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.840
because you're right,
we were talking about this on the way to something today.

601
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.770
It is,
uh,
we have something like Abu Ghraib happens.

602
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.890
It's a terrible situation.
A lot of bad things went on there.

603
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.400
The idea though that an entire company of American soldiers would go into an

604
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:13.131
Iraqi village and wipe out 500 innocent people that is inconceivable today,

605
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:18.240
uh,
in,
in the sense that so many things would have to go wrong and break down and

606
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:22.140
degrade and degenerate in the American military for that to have happened,

607
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.030
that it's just,
it seems like a completely different moral universe.

608
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.253
And

609
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.750
you look at what the chain of events that led to me lie.
It was those,

610
00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:35.910
and if any of those chain of events,

611
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.780
any anywhere along that chain of events could have broken that whole chain.

612
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.530
Lieutenant Calley could've gotten killed when the minefield and now you could

613
00:36:43.531 --> 00:36:47.610
add someone else came in that was a better leader and didn't have a Napoleon

614
00:36:47.611 --> 00:36:51.030
complex and was able to stand up morally to other people.
There's,

615
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.410
there's so many things that could have changed on that,
you know,

616
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.020
that could've changed that whole scenario.
The most,

617
00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.300
the most powerful one being a different leader.

618
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:01.380
It's the same thing at Sand Creek,

619
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.030
different leaders that actually never would have happened.
Right?

620
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.380
I never would have happened.
And you felt you do see that,
you know,

621
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:11.430
you see all the guys on their side lost soul like you 90 Mosley,

622
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:14.700
they all agree with team where I was all the guys we achieving [inaudible] it's

623
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:19.140
like clearly there's a leadership element where the average guy in those units

624
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.520
is heavily influenced by WHO's setting an example for them.

625
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.390
And that is one of the scenes that interests me about human nature that,

626
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:27.901
you know,

627
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:31.200
one of the things cause we were discussing like does that mean that human being,

628
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.510
you know,
one of the things that we had our law with,

629
00:37:32.511 --> 00:37:35.850
these are human beings just Tivo by nature.
And he's like,
no,
they're not evil.

630
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.850
Do Majority of people are.
Now there are of course the exceptions that he's,

631
00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:42.150
that whatever's mold percentage,
but the majority of human beings are not evil.

632
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.200
The problem is that the majority of human being Saturday,
extremely easy,

633
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:49.530
lean for once,
like they're more alcohol and plus can range in so many.

634
00:37:49.531 --> 00:37:52.450
Do you fit in direction that and they're right.

635
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.430
Leadership Day will be awesome human beings and the wrong leader shape,

636
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.810
he's not that hard for them to start sliding down it really direct direction.

637
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:05.940
So to me it kind of is a method of weakness more than evil.

638
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.330
You know,

639
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:10.270
it's not that these guys are a complete psychopath where you know you have been

640
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:13.200
there with them and they are nice people and they yell to the Old Lady Cross the

641
00:38:13.201 --> 00:38:17.760
street and yet the,
the Getty,
why did,

642
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:19.320
they may have good intentions,

643
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:23.430
good intentions don't go too far without crazy DC planes,

644
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:24.630
throng willpower.

645
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:29.690
A lot of the qualities that allow you to keep it as Gooding tension real and

646
00:38:30.691 --> 00:38:34.520
they're heavy emotional thresher where he doesn't all fly out the window and

647
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:37.090
it's like,
I don't know what happened.
I just lost my mind.
Or Hey,

648
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:40.330
they told me that this was the thing to do.
And so I just followed orders.

649
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.070
You know where you have that integrity to stay present in a crazy situation.

650
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:51.250
You're asking human beings to be kind of extraordinary in those circumstances

651
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.100
because the ordinary human being may go down a bad path.

652
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.330
So the antidote in some ways seem to be to make yourself extraordinary,

653
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:03.640
to be,
to be able to withstand a kind of situation and that's where,

654
00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:03.981
and get a,

655
00:39:03.981 --> 00:39:07.960
to lead or make a huge difference because so many people would be like flags in

656
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:11.040
the wind.
You know,
if the wind is tilting one way,
they will go with it.

657
00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:14.470
Even though we,
the Stilton heavily the other way,
they'll also go that route and,

658
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:15.581
and so that,

659
00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:20.581
what interests me is because while a few humans will always choose a pretty

660
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:25.390
massive dop,
evil side,
a bunch of humans can go either way.

661
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.070
What is that shape?

662
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:31.210
The kind of human beings that we'll be able to be a great leader or even just

663
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:33.670
for themselves,
even if they are Dave,
nobody under them,

664
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:37.840
just they will make choices that in an ideal scenario,

665
00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:42.580
most human beings would want to make.
What does separate the guy who,

666
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.520
you know,
he's sitting there on the couch saying,
oh,

667
00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:48.550
I would beat a guy and a guy who actually is that guy.

668
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.540
I think one of the difficulties with that,
um,

669
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.900
is Jocko,
you and Jordan Peterson talked about this and um,

670
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.670
your podcast together.
Um,

671
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.600
you were talking about the book ordinary men and how,
uh,
you know,

672
00:40:04.601 --> 00:40:08.020
you've got a couple guys,
a group of guys there who are going to,

673
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.640
who are being ordered to do something that's grotesque and it's not simply a

674
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:14.890
matter of like,
you know,
that's a real good situation.
If,

675
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:19.390
let's say you are a person of strong moral character of just all the things that

676
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:20.380
you would want them to be.

677
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.950
You've got two conflicting moral systems here because you have a duty and

678
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:27.940
obligation to your fellow soldiers who are going to have to go do this one way

679
00:40:27.941 --> 00:40:31.660
or another unless you revolt completely and then you're betraying your country

680
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:33.880
and there's all these other things that are brought into it that,
you know,

681
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.960
that are moral things.
These are,
you know,
it's,

682
00:40:35.961 --> 00:40:40.570
it's moral to not want to abandon your friends and your colleagues to have to go

683
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:44.950
do the hard work that has to be done so that you can go nurture yourself,

684
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:46.990
righteous sense of personal morality.

685
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:49.720
Or at least that's the type of thinking that might go through a person's head.

686
00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:49.930
Like,
no,

687
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:54.930
what right do I have to put my own personal idea of what's right ahead of my

688
00:40:55.721 --> 00:41:00.220
obligation as a soldier ahead of what my country is telling me to do ahead of,

689
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.413
uh,

690
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.590
just being in there with all of my friends and fellow soldiers and leaving it to

691
00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:07.210
them.
Like that's a moral thing.
And that is a,

692
00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.830
that is something that you want people to feel.
Right.
And I,
and I,

693
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.820
and I wonder sometimes how much of these situations are filled with people who,

694
00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:19.030
um,
you know,
maybe 90% of them,

695
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.910
the vast majority that aren't those few evil ones,

696
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.400
they're all kind of looking at each other.
Like,

697
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.300
maybe inside they don't necessarily think this is right or B or they don't want

698
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.230
to be doing this,

699
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.830
but they don't want to abandon their friends and their friends are looking at

700
00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:36.690
them thinking the same thing and you just have this vicious cycle,
you know the,

701
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.510
in one of these things.
Yeah.

702
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.600
And part of the problem there is the human willingness to rationalize and make

703
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.150
justifications for oneself.
He's like,
well in again,

704
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.060
cause you know when you look at the principles that people hold,

705
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:53.690
like what they believe their philosophy of life is and the way they behave,

706
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.690
even you match more ordinary circumstances.

707
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:59.150
I mean you made the example of the cheating husband,
right?

708
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:04.250
How many people seriously believe that monogamy is the right thing and you don't

709
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:07.610
cheat on your spouse?
There will be lots and lots and lots of people who say,

710
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:11.000
yeah,
of course I believe in it.
How many people actually live up to it?

711
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:16.010
And it's like,
come on man,
that's not nobody's shooting at you or nobody.

712
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:19.610
There are no,
it's a match.
More mellow situation.

713
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:24.670
And people in many cases can to live up to their ideals in very ordinary

714
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:25.970
circumstances,

715
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.870
let alone when you start pressing the buttons and when the circumstances are no

716
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:30.800
longer hoard in Ra.

717
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:34.520
But it becomes real panic time and stress and all of that goes up.

718
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.180
So to me it's like you need to have almost a maniacal determination to f discord

719
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.960
of Condo that you will hold up no matter what happens.

720
00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.770
Like I use it as it's a joke but is not a joke.

721
00:42:48.771 --> 00:42:53.210
Like I use it for daily life as like to me once I am very few moral rules that

722
00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:57.620
are absolutes.
But the ones that are,
there are no exception.
So for me,

723
00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:01.610
like if you give your word to somebody,
there are no exception.

724
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:06.080
It's like don't give your word unless you are 110% sure you're going to keep it.

725
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:07.940
Don't,
I don't mind.
You know,

726
00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:10.370
we can have a regular conversation and you don't give your word,

727
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.020
but if you do give your award to me there is no,
oh sorry.

728
00:43:15.021 --> 00:43:18.140
I didn't think in that situation are there was that exception to me.

729
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:21.350
The only way you apologize is a summer I style,
you know,

730
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:24.890
you stick a knife in your belly and use lives back and forth.
That's how you say,

731
00:43:24.891 --> 00:43:29.310
sorry.
There is no exception to that.
It's almost as if,
uh,
you have the,

732
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.330
that those rules serve as pollsters stars.
When you're in a situation,

733
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:36.710
it's as chaotic as something like combat where you have to have a few rules
that,

734
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.610
I mean,
maybe they're arbitrary but you'll die for him.
Yeah.

735
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.760
Because when you're in the midst of a situation that is completely outside the

736
00:43:43.761 --> 00:43:48.420
realm of your normal experience,
uh,
they give you reference points,
you know,

737
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.660
they get,

738
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:52.610
they structure the situation a little bit for you so you're not just lost in

739
00:43:52.611 --> 00:43:54.470
chaos.
There's some structure to it.

740
00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:58.400
And then you can evaluate the rest of the environment relative to those hard and

741
00:43:58.401 --> 00:44:01.730
fast rules that you've got.
Because in the situation,
you know,

742
00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:05.240
when you're in me lie and you're one of the people who's kind of on the fence,

743
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.740
but now people are shooting,

744
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.330
that is not the time to have this argument with yourself.
No,

745
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.760
that's not when you're going to figure it out.
Yeah,
for sure.
Well,

746
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:18.140
this might sound really obvious and it is,
it's a very simple,

747
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.330
obvious answer to this really,

748
00:44:20.331 --> 00:44:24.950
really hard question of how do you prevent this thing from happening or who's

749
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:28.160
the kind of person that will stand up?
And the answer is it's actually,

750
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:32.280
it's quite simple.
It's training and education.
It's training

751
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.113
<v 0>and education.</v>

752
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:38.270
And if people understand that these kinds of things can happen and they get put

753
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:43.410
in these pressers situations and they get trained and they get debriefed on

754
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:47.550
mistakes that they made and they saw that they got emotional and you train them

755
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.384
correctly,

756
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:53.660
well then you've got someone who gets into a me lies situation and and says to

757
00:44:54.121 --> 00:44:58.710
themselves,
wait a second,
we're not getting shot at right now.
Cease Fire.
And,

758
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:02.760
and that was the most incredible thing about that story is that's all it took

759
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.630
was a one leader to say,
hey,
stop killing people.
And they,

760
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:08.490
they literally stopped at that moment.

761
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:14.330
So training people and putting them in these situations and educating them so

762
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:19.650
that they understand so that they have pattern recognition,

763
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.380
training them so that they can learn how to detach,

764
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.500
training them so that they can control their emotions,
training them,

765
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:30.450
that they can see when horrible things are unfolding before them and then how

766
00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.990
that they can put a stop to them.
That is what is important.

767
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.720
And as you mentioned Daryl,
as the,

768
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.910
as the Vietnam War drove on that the training got less and less than that.

769
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.000
The officers were getting sent over quicker and quicker and you're getting on

770
00:45:45.001 --> 00:45:46.620
the job training and the person that you're getting on,

771
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:49.800
on the job training from is a person that's only been doing it for two and a

772
00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:53.820
half months longer than you.
And that's,
that's how these things occur.

773
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.380
So you have to invest in,
in,
in people that are going to be in these situations.

774
00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:01.050
And it's the same thing I'm getting.
I tell this to businesses all the time,

775
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.910
have you done,
you know,
on a construction site,
have you done a drill?

776
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.280
If you have a mass casualty,
w do you know what,

777
00:46:08.281 --> 00:46:11.220
you know where you're going to call in casualty evacuation?

778
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:12.870
Do you know we're getting into what the air,

779
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.060
air flight are a life flight numbers.

780
00:46:15.061 --> 00:46:18.600
Does anyone have the life flight number here?
Because if someone gets hurt,

781
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.050
you need to make that call.
And do you know what station you're going to call,

782
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.210
what helicopter you're going to call?
Do you know where they're gonna land?

783
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.190
Why would you not run those things?

784
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.830
And if those things unfold and you're not prepared for him,

785
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:29.731
you're going to fall apart.

786
00:46:29.731 --> 00:46:34.731
And it's the same thing with these ethical and moral situations where if you

787
00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:39.150
don't understand what they are and you don't understand what can go wrong,

788
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.910
you're gonna have,
you're gonna have a bad day.

789
00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.373
<v 2>And I felt he was,</v>

790
00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:48.220
but he didn't know what you brought up a little bit ago when you said that are

791
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:53.680
steps along the way that long before the crisis manifest itself,

792
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:58.480
there's that ability to recognize the tiny little steps that are leading there.

793
00:46:58.481 --> 00:47:00.580
Now when you look at the tiny thing,
it looks tiny.

794
00:47:00.581 --> 00:47:04.270
It doesn't look like a big deal.
That's no crises that it's not a problem.

795
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.390
But he's that first step that's taking you down that path.

796
00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.680
And it's a lot easier to stop it orally than when crisis is on.

797
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.540
And so in that sense,

798
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.750
that does become a training that does become a thing of like how do you

799
00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:19.420
recognize the steps,
how do you work on it?
And you know,

800
00:47:19.421 --> 00:47:21.550
you are saying seeing so like even something as magic,

801
00:47:21.551 --> 00:47:25.390
I hate [inaudible] take one second to breathe before you react.

802
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.710
Then seeing how you want to react is the same thing.
That to everything.

803
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:33.010
It applies to conversational.
When people are people you cared about,

804
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:36.880
maybe are getting you angry,
do you really want to respond right away?

805
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:41.680
Or maybe take 30 seconds to take a breath,
then decide how you want to respond.

806
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.800
You know,
and I think he's like,

807
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:47.530
to me is we are at as silly as that.
He's,
because you don't,

808
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:51.600
clearly war and [inaudible] are very far.
You'll need versus,

809
00:47:51.601 --> 00:47:54.210
I've seen so many ways,
but to me as being one of the seat,

810
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.970
if I didn't go to Archie,
it's,
I guess I got four class.

811
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:03.660
But I guess to me has been one of the most and forgiving mirrors that I added.

812
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:09.361
I ever had poutine front of me was seen our why react under extreme stress when

813
00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:13.150
you haven't slept for two days when somebody is throwing a fee.

814
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:16.720
So that's completely unjustified when and sad.
Then he's like,
yeah,

815
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:20.440
you have a little,
the good reasons to be mad by really this is how you respond,

816
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.700
this is how you will react to a four year old kid was just being a 40 year old

817
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:26.120
kid and you get all emotional.

818
00:48:26.121 --> 00:48:30.940
They do study island and suddenly like 10 seconds seemed to me blow it up.

819
00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.930
I see myself from the outside and I'm like,
um,

820
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.270
every scene that I despise in this moment,

821
00:48:36.271 --> 00:48:40.140
you know that man right there that's responding their way as all the reasons as

822
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:44.450
older I can see why does it matter that you still don't do it?
You know?

823
00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.100
And rather than just being like,
okay,
let's wait for myself,

824
00:48:48.101 --> 00:48:50.890
I'm a horrible human being.
I discovered that.
He's like,
okay,

825
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:54.980
what can I do now to get the next time you got real world world

826
00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.270
<v 0>training,
right?</v>

827
00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.630
Cause now you recognize the situation and now you don't let it happen anymore.

828
00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:04.400
Exactly.
You know,
I had,
I was talking to you guys earlier,
we,
I hit it,

829
00:49:04.401 --> 00:49:07.370
my first deployment to Iraq,
we went and hit a target and,

830
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:11.090
and it sounds almost like,
you know,
like what you'd imagine in a movie.

831
00:49:11.091 --> 00:49:15.440
We'd get handed a map and on the map and to be a city block in Baghdad and

832
00:49:15.441 --> 00:49:18.920
there'd be a red x on one of the buildings and that's all I needed.

833
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:22.250
Oh you want me to go hit that red x?
Cool.
We'll go hit that red x.

834
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:27.410
And one night we went and hit,
you know,
the building with the red x on it.

835
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:29.480
And when we hit the target,

836
00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:33.590
it was the most normal family you could ever imagine.

837
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.400
And as we started talking to them and we had our interpreter get in there and

838
00:49:37.401 --> 00:49:40.430
figure out,
hey,
do you know who this person is?
Were like,
yeah,

839
00:49:40.431 --> 00:49:42.350
he lives two doors down.
Oh,
okay.

840
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.510
And so then I went back and eventually said to myself a question that if I

841
00:49:47.511 --> 00:49:50.480
wasn't,
if I had more experience,
I would have asked this question for me.
I said,

842
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.170
Hey,
I've got a question.
Who put that red x on that building and why?

843
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.330
And as I pulled the string on it,
it,
you know,

844
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.860
it was one of those things where they had gotten some Intel,
which you know,

845
00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:07.070
I won't talk about where it came from,
but it was,
it was intel that,
you know,

846
00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.480
put it in that general vicinity and they like pick the center of the general

847
00:50:11.481 --> 00:50:11.931
vicinity.

848
00:50:11.931 --> 00:50:15.350
There's the center of the genitals and either they will put the x and no

849
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:19.100
followup.
And so I always taught that as something,
hey guys,

850
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:21.920
make sure you know who's giving you this intelligence.
And that's,

851
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:25.670
that's the case that happened to me.
Lie,
where the f the person on the,
no one,

852
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:30.260
no one at the platoon said,
hey,
whoa,
hold on a second.

853
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:35.290
Who's who's confirming that this is 100% VC in this village?

854
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.930
A hunch.
You're telling me this is 100% VC in this village.

855
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.290
That's what we're saying right now.
Who's talking,
who's saying that?

856
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:46.460
I want to talk to that person and that's another thing I talk about all the time

857
00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:47.294
is

858
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.280
<v 3>yeah,</v>

859
00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.430
<v 0>you don't,
as a leader,
you don't want to be surrounded by yes men.</v>

860
00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.560
You don't want to be surrounded by yes men.

861
00:50:53.561 --> 00:50:55.990
And you know we're talking about the horrors of Vietnam War and I'm reading

862
00:50:55.991 --> 00:51:00.070
another book right now and there's a platoon commander and his guys are going

863
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:00.430
there.

864
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:05.140
They're rotating between three locations and two of the locations are not too

865
00:51:05.141 --> 00:51:09.820
bad.
The other locations is a nightmare.
It's,
it's,
it's Vietnam war stereotypical.

866
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.700
It's booby traps,
snipers and indirect fire.

867
00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:17.740
They never see the enemy.
They just never see the enemy.

868
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:22.780
And all they do is they go out there on patrol,
they get blown up,

869
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.410
they get shot,
they get mortared,
and they never see the enemy and the guy,

870
00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.750
the guys are getting wounded or killed.
And

871
00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.270
as you think about that,
I would,

872
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:35.690
<v 3>okay,</v>

873
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:40.690
<v 0>I would pray that if I was the company commander or the battalion commander,</v>

874
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:45.650
that that platoon commander would come to me and say,
Hey Jocko,

875
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:47.540
this is stupid.

876
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.720
Let me tell you how many people we've lost any time and any other,

877
00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.910
the platoons of lost.
And let me tell you what we've gotten out of it.

878
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:55.720
We've got nothing out of it and we,

879
00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.070
we need to stop this or we need to find a better way to do it.

880
00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.800
If you want to send us in there,
let us set up a strong point.

881
00:52:00.801 --> 00:52:04.520
Let us set up a bunkered position and we'll stay in.
We'll observe.

882
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.820
But us just walking around in there waiting to get blown up makes no sense

883
00:52:07.821 --> 00:52:10.520
whatsoever.
Please,
let's do something else.

884
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.540
And as a leader you have to have the open mind to say,
okay,

885
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:19.040
I thank you.
I appreciate that feedback.
What are your suggestions?

886
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:21.740
You've been in the area of operations.
How do you recommend we do it?

887
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:27.250
And whenever I hear these stories of guys that get put in really terrible

888
00:52:27.411 --> 00:52:30.560
situations in the military,
it,
it sickens my heart.

889
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:35.450
Because what you need is a culture inside any organization.
The military,
yes,

890
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.410
but any organization of people to raise their hands and say,
Hey,
wait a second,

891
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.360
this is stupid.
Hey,
wait a second.

892
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:46.010
Do I not see an American flag on that Indian reservation with a white piece flag

893
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:49.520
underneath it and wait,
wait,
hold on,
stop,
wait,
wait,
wait,
stop.

894
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.950
And that takes moral courage.

895
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.340
It takes training and it takes a culture inside an organization to stop people

896
00:52:57.351 --> 00:52:58.640
and question what they're doing.

897
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.480
And it takes a certain level of detachment that you were talking.

898
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.070
It absolutely takes detachment.
You know,
it's like,
uh,

899
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:06.950
you were saying about like dealing with a four year old or something.

900
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:10.910
Like when you're in the middle of it.
Yeah.
It's seems normal.

901
00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:14.170
It seems like the way to behave.
And it's only when you step back and say,
well,

902
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:18.950
you know,
uh,
one of the things about human beings are great strength I suppose,

903
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.590
is that we're supremely adaptable creatures.

904
00:53:21.591 --> 00:53:26.250
I was talking to a psychologist one time who used to work for the State

905
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:26.250
Department

906
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.730
<v 1>and he would,
uh,
he worked in Africa for awhile.
He talked about,</v>

907
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.080
he was telling me some of the stuff that he would encounter whole villages,
um,

908
00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.230
where every woman had been raped 10 times,
uh,

909
00:53:37.231 --> 00:53:40.050
over the years where kids in this village should have watched their parents

910
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:43.950
killed.
Just horrifying stuff.
And my question to them at the time,

911
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.710
cause he was a psychologist,
uh,
was,
I mean,

912
00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:51.711
how are these people not just completely blown out with Ptsd and everything

913
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:52.591
else?

914
00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:56.340
Like how are they functional at all given what we know about Ptsd and how it

915
00:53:56.341 --> 00:54:00.240
does function under circumstances that are far less severe than that?

916
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.030
And that's what he said.
He said,
you'd be surprised.
Humans are very,

917
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:05.730
very adaptable into them.
This is their environment.

918
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.550
And that can work the other way too though,
you know,

919
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:12.520
that can work in the direction of uh,
the,
in the new,
uh,

920
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:15.150
Ken Burns Vietnam documentary,
which is just,

921
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:19.280
I don't know if you've watched it yet,
the products,

922
00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.500
I think the first two episodes.
Okay.
So I'm one of the ones you're coming up on.

923
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.540
Uh,
the name of it is,

924
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:28.500
this is what we do and it starts out talking about this get new recruit and he

925
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:32.120
shows up to this place and like the first thing he sees when he gets to a,

926
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:35.460
the base cities at,
it's not a mask or anything like that,

927
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:38.400
but it's just sort of a,
you know,
a Vietnamese prisoner or,

928
00:54:38.401 --> 00:54:41.350
or a captive being led along by,
you know,

929
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:44.640
a corporal or something and he's just being rough with them and kind of push

930
00:54:44.641 --> 00:54:48.060
them along and doing stuff that clearly is outside of regulations.

931
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.690
And this new guy shows up and he's like,
Hey,

932
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.890
like you supposed to be doing that or whatever it is.

933
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.030
And the first thing he hears when he gets over there,
his kid,
this is Vietnam,

934
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:57.930
this is what we do.

935
00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.680
And he said that their whole rest of the time that he was there when he saw

936
00:55:01.681 --> 00:55:04.890
something he didn't like when he was doing things that he wasn't sure about,

937
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:08.340
he just repeated in his head,
this is Vietnam,
this is what we do,

938
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.390
this is what we do.
And after awhile he didn't have to repeat it anymore.

939
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:16.890
After a while that was his environment.
And you know,
it reminds me,

940
00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:18.630
I used to have these recurring dreams.

941
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:21.120
I probably shouldn't share this on the air,
but um,

942
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.370
I used to have these recurring dreams.
I still have him every once in a while.
Uh,

943
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:28.980
the details and the setting differ,
but um,
it'll be something like,
um,

944
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:34.100
the dream starts and I'm in like a helicopter say and I'm flying around like a

945
00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:38.490
city like la or wherever and I'm just shooting people like grand theft auto.

946
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:40.590
It's just like a video game Tryna Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

947
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:42.240
And I'm going through and I'm doing all this.

948
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:43.320
Sometimes there's people down there,

949
00:55:43.321 --> 00:55:45.960
I know my friends and stuff and it's just all,

950
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.710
it seems just like I'm in a video game.
And then the way the dream goes,

951
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.770
is it a certain point after a few minutes of this,

952
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.660
all of a sudden it hits me what I'm doing and I look around and I,

953
00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:59.130
it's almost as if I wake up in the dream and I'm like,
oh my God,

954
00:55:59.131 --> 00:56:01.530
like I'm killing all these people.
What,
what am I doing?

955
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.890
But at the time it was completely normal.

956
00:56:04.891 --> 00:56:08.760
It seemed exactly like this is just what I should be doing or anything like
that.

957
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.120
And that's something that I think that is,
well,

958
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:15.360
it's why you told people stop looking down the barrel of your gun.
You know,

959
00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:16.550
you got to step back and,

960
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.980
and be able to get that distance so you can change your frame.
And again,

961
00:56:19.981 --> 00:56:24.400
with the proper training
and the proper education,

962
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:29.700
<v 0>you will know as a leader that that behavior will escalate,</v>

963
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.570
that behavior will escalate.
And if you allow it to happen,

964
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.600
it will continue to get worse.
And so it starts off,

965
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.560
and I've read all kinds of books about,
about Vietnam,

966
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:45.940
especially about Vietnam,
where it starts off,
it starts off with,
hey,

967
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.810
the villagers are,
we kind of know them,
everything's cool,
give Molly pops,

968
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.720
but then you know,
one of our guys dies and then,
well,

969
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:54.380
we're not getting lollipops.
As a matter of fact,
we're,

970
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.850
we're kicking the kids away and it,
it only escalates to their,

971
00:56:57.851 --> 00:57:02.050
and it escalates to murder and it escalates.

972
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.570
Or I should say this,
it can escalate.

973
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:09.520
It doesn't automatically escalate because all it takes is someone to step in and

974
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:13.330
say,
Hey,
no,
that's across the line.
But you know what?
You want to slap a guy.

975
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:17.830
I get it,
I get it.
But that's the line.

976
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.710
Anything once,
you know,
one thing that we used to say,

977
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:24.250
and I used to tell my guys once the cuffs are on somebody,

978
00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:26.020
so once we get somebody zip-tied,
it's over.

979
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:29.980
Like you do what you gotta do to get a guy under control.
Once there's uptight,

980
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.080
it's done.
And now they're,
they're,

981
00:57:33.081 --> 00:57:37.540
they're getting taken care of and you,
you treat them firm,
but fair.

982
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.170
That's it.
And so those lines you,

983
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.840
you have to draw them and you have to hold the line as a leader because things

984
00:57:43.841 --> 00:57:44.550
start to escalate.
You know,

985
00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:47.190
what's the thing that you were asking me about earlier about the,
the,

986
00:57:47.191 --> 00:57:50.300
the Chechen war and the Russians against the Chechens and it's,

987
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.240
they didn't,

988
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.840
they didn't hold the line with the little things and that when you lose that

989
00:57:55.841 --> 00:57:58.480
discipline,
even on the smaller things,

990
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.530
well eventually then you don't have the discipline on the bigger things.

991
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:04.990
Can you go overboard with that?
Yes,
you can.

992
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:08.230
I can hold the discipline so hard on the little things that no one listens to me

993
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:09.064
on the big things.

994
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.560
That's why leadership is hard because there's a dichotomy there that you have to

995
00:58:11.561 --> 00:58:15.520
balance.
You can't be freaked out because you know,
you didn't,

996
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:20.380
you didn't blouse your boots when you were supposed to,
but at the same time,

997
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:25.540
if I start to let too many things slide well it will escalate.

998
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.490
<v 1>And it seems like maybe with things like that,</v>

999
00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:32.220
a lot of people who were civilians,
they,
they laugh when they see in movies or

1000
00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:37.300
TV shows or something about how soldiers in combat are still expected to groom

1001
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:37.911
themselves,

1002
00:58:37.911 --> 00:58:40.840
are still expected to take care of themselves and comport themselves in a

1003
00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:43.960
military way.
And what I tell them a lot of the times is,

1004
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.380
and maybe you can confirm this because I don't really know what I'm talking

1005
00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:51.550
about,
but it is that,
uh,
you know,
my feeling on,
uh,
on,

1006
00:58:51.551 --> 00:58:56.551
on why that stuff is so important is that you can't have,

1007
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.900
uh,
you know,
you can't have Iraq and the sectarian war in all the stuff,

1008
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:03.550
the storm that's going on around them,

1009
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.510
you can't have that become the environment to which they're adapting the

1010
00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:10.300
environment to which they need to be well adapted as the u s military.

1011
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.040
That's their environment.

1012
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.790
That's what they're focused on following these rules and behaving in this way.

1013
00:59:15.791 --> 00:59:17.920
And then when that's their environment,

1014
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:21.380
they can go into these places and do their jobs if they get in there and start

1015
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:24.720
reacting to what's going on around them.
Because,
I mean,
you,

1016
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:29.510
you then you can tell a guy talking about going native,
native,

1017
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.300
you know,
once a it's apocalypse now,
you can tell a guy,
uh,

1018
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.350
once the cuffs are on.
Uh,
but you know,
if,

1019
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:40.790
if I was talking to a family yesterday and this is the guy that just cut their

1020
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:45.620
heads off,
well,
I mean,
you know,

1021
00:59:45.621 --> 00:59:47.150
you,
you can't have,

1022
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.260
you can't put yourself in a situation because it does make sense to beat the

1023
00:59:51.261 --> 00:59:51.951
shit out of that guy.

1024
00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:54.920
It does make sense to put a bullet in his head when the cuffs are on,

1025
00:59:54.921 --> 00:59:58.110
like from a,
even from a moral standpoint in certain ways like that,

1026
00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.980
you can justify that,
you know?
Um,

1027
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.150
and so that's why you can't be reacting to whatever it is it's going on.

1028
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.070
And it sounds like that's kind of what you're saying.

1029
01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:11.100
<v 0>Yeah.
And there's actually an interesting dichotomy there as well because</v>

1030
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:16.260
you,
you need to follow the rules,
right?

1031
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.410
Because if I told,
if the three of us decided,
hey,

1032
01:00:19.411 --> 01:00:23.910
we're going to go on this village raid and we're all going to use our morals as

1033
01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:26.880
our guide,
well we have three different scenarios.
You're,

1034
01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:30.450
you just admitted that you'd be executing somebody that was already handcuffed,

1035
01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.320
uh,
who knows what you'd be doing.
You know,
I don't even want to know.
Right.
So,

1036
01:00:35.321 --> 01:00:38.640
so we were all over the map,
right.
Maybe you're,
maybe you're saying you're,

1037
01:00:38.641 --> 01:00:39.181
you're not even going to,

1038
01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:42.000
I don't even want to handcuff anyone cause you think that's too offensive and

1039
01:00:42.001 --> 01:00:45.570
I'm somewhere in the middle.
Whatever the case may be,
we're all over the map.

1040
01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:50.550
So I would always tell the guys,
look,
you need to do what is legal,

1041
01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:52.170
what's,
what's legal.

1042
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:57.450
But then the paradox of that is sometimes what you can get away with the legally

1043
01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:01.230
still isn't the right thing to do.
And that's again,

1044
01:01:01.231 --> 01:01:02.910
that's why there's a dichotomy between those two.

1045
01:01:02.911 --> 01:01:07.590
Between do I follow the rules exactly.
Or,
I mean,
you know,
look at,

1046
01:01:07.591 --> 01:01:11.480
look at me,
I look at Sand Creek,
I that my boss told me to shoot this guy show,

1047
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.690
told me to shoot this three year old baby.
My boss told me to do that.

1048
01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.950
I am,
I should I be following orders?
Is there a threat that I don't know about?

1049
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.170
You know,
these days,
you know,

1050
01:01:22.171 --> 01:01:26.970
I've heard a lot of stories now the guys that that took down Mozel right?

1051
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:29.160
The,
the enemy was sending,

1052
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:34.340
surrendering children to come and surrender to coalition forces and they would

1053
01:01:34.981 --> 01:01:37.920
be strapped with a ID vests,

1054
01:01:37.921 --> 01:01:41.520
suicide vests and over and over and over again,

1055
01:01:41.521 --> 01:01:44.310
it was our US military,
you know,
especially our,

1056
01:01:44.311 --> 01:01:49.230
our explosive ordinance disposal folks that were going in disarming these bombs

1057
01:01:49.231 --> 01:01:52.170
on these kids.
But yeah,

1058
01:01:52.171 --> 01:01:57.171
how do you feel after you see two or three of those little kids get killed plus

1059
01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:00.900
two or three EOD guys get killed and now you're going to fight those guys and

1060
01:02:00.901 --> 01:02:03.390
they want to surrender.
That's a very challenging thing.

1061
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.980
And if you don't maintain discipline,
it's a slippery slope.

1062
01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:10.830
And it's funny because we're saying two seats

1063
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.190
<v 1>said the same time,
which sound contradictory.</v>

1064
01:02:13.191 --> 01:02:17.750
And yet that's life that on one end you need to have this super strict rules.

1065
01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:20.340
They are now going to band under any circumstances.

1066
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.940
And on the other end you think that you rightly point out too is the fact that

1067
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:27.720
real leadership is also the ability to think on your feet and no two situations

1068
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:31.870
are alike.
So the rule following approach,

1069
01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.270
while he may save you from some of the worst abuses is not always necessarily

1070
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:36.871
the right thing.

1071
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:41.520
And there is also the time when we all lost follow the rules except when we

1072
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:43.920
don't because that's the one time when it's correct.

1073
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:47.130
And that ability to make the right call at the right time,

1074
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.790
that's what make an extraordinary human being.

1075
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:54.580
We're just sort of in debates are popping off at the mouth today.
We,

1076
01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:58.290
we sort of take for granted that the whole,
um,
I was just following orders.

1077
01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.720
Question was settled at Nuremberg.
It was not settled at all.

1078
01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:03.870
That's an incredibly complicated question for just the reason you were

1079
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:05.600
describing.
You know,
uh,

1080
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.170
somebody who worked at a Nazi death camp,
um,

1081
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.190
you know,

1082
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:15.870
they didn't make 10,000 independent decisions to kill somebody.

1083
01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:21.060
Uh,
they made one decision that their own personal moral compass was going to get

1084
01:03:21.061 --> 01:03:24.630
outsourced to the state and that they were going to do their duty and follow

1085
01:03:24.631 --> 01:03:27.030
their orders.
They made that decision once and now,

1086
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:29.880
once you've made that decision and you've outsourced your moral compass,

1087
01:03:29.881 --> 01:03:30.714
which again,

1088
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:36.410
under most circumstances that might be the thing that keeps you from doing the

1089
01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:39.870
wrong thing now might be the thing that keeps me from executing that,
you know,

1090
01:03:39.871 --> 01:03:40.710
al Qaeda Guy.

1091
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:44.610
But when the institutions themselves start to get warped or if you're in,
even,

1092
01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:49.380
even if the institution is an individual unit or something,
you know,
uh,
it's,

1093
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.120
uh,
I can't remember where I heard it,
but there's a,

1094
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:56.230
some zoologist or somebody who pointed out to him that,
uh,

1095
01:03:56.310 --> 01:04:01.310
he had asked why zebras have black and white stripes when the grass is gold

1096
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:04.530
colored in yellow.
And they don't blend into that at all.

1097
01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:05.820
Clearly Tigers can see that.

1098
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:08.790
And he pointed out to him that that camouflage isn't to blend into the

1099
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:12.600
environment.
That camouflage is to blend in with each other.

1100
01:04:12.601 --> 01:04:17.010
They blend with the herd.
And so the Tigers have a difficult time tracking down,

1101
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:20.810
like in focusing on an individual.
And uh,
they,
oh,

1102
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.890
they figured that out because they wanted to try to,
you know,

1103
01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:25.260
put ear clips on them or something to track these things around.

1104
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.840
But they noticed every time they put something identifiable on one of them,

1105
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:31.230
the Tigers would kill it.
And it was because now they had something to focus on.

1106
01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:33.270
And so,
and that's,
you know,

1107
01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:35.790
I'm not making a literal evolutionary comparison here,

1108
01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:37.950
but there's an interesting like,
just sort of analogy,

1109
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:40.890
which is this instinct to blend in with the herd.

1110
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:45.810
There's just their safety there.
There's a sense of security there and there's,

1111
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:50.811
there's virtue in for fitting a certain amount of your personal judgment to the

1112
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:53.280
group to which you have obligations.

1113
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:56.040
That's a good thing under most circumstances.
You know what I mean?

1114
01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.370
At least in a lot of circumstances,
you know,
that's what duty is.
That's what,
um,

1115
01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.500
you know,
just fulfilling your obligations to your people or you know,

1116
01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:05.880
your unit or something like who are you,

1117
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.020
especially if you're an 18 year old kid who just got out of high school and

1118
01:05:10.021 --> 01:05:13.440
you're over there and you're in a situation where you've got,
you know,

1119
01:05:13.441 --> 01:05:17.530
like in me lie,
you've got officers,
you've got,
uh,
you know,

1120
01:05:17.531 --> 01:05:18.940
not just your immediate officer,

1121
01:05:18.941 --> 01:05:21.940
but it seems to be being reinforced by your captain above,
you know,

1122
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:25.120
your company commander at the time,
and me lie,
there was a,

1123
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:29.470
there was a major general in a helicopter observing,
buzzing around that place.

1124
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.880
And so,
you know,
you're in a situation where you say to yourself like,

1125
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.390
who am I to say that what's going on here is wrong?

1126
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:42.130
It seems wrong to me because of what I learned from my Mama,
or whatever.

1127
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.150
But you know what?
What does that mean?
I've got a captain,
I've got a lieutenant,

1128
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:50.110
I've got my sergeant's,
I've got this major general in the air.
And you know,

1129
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.610
maybe I'm wrong,
maybe this,
you know,
I just got here four months ago.
This was my,

1130
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.620
this is Charlie company's first major combat operation is it really hadn't made

1131
01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:01.830
contact direct combat with the enemy.
Uh,

1132
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:05.020
and this is the first time any of them have seen combat for the most part.

1133
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.470
And I think it's uh,
um,

1134
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:11.200
there's certainly a certain amount of weakness that's involved like you were

1135
01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:12.034
talking about.

1136
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:15.820
But I also think there's a certain amount of moral confusion that happens and

1137
01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:18.490
that's,
that's,
there can't be that kind of confusion.

1138
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:20.980
Like that is where leadership has got to take over.

1139
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:25.270
<v 0>I can add another layer of complexity to this.
Okay.
So,
so first of all,</v>

1140
01:06:25.271 --> 01:06:29.680
I do think that the,
well Napoleon said,

1141
01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.250
if you execute an order that you know is wrong and what he was talking about,

1142
01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:35.440
and he's not talking about something and moral,

1143
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:38.410
he's talking about if I do something where a bunch of my men get killed because

1144
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:42.850
the general said to do it and I do it,
I'm culpable.
So that's,

1145
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.900
that's pretty clear that if your boss tells you to do something that you know is

1146
01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:50.650
going to,
in Napoleon's case,
it was getting a bunch of your guys killed then,

1147
01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.500
then you say no,
and if you do it,
you're called Bobo for what happens.

1148
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:54.880
You could say the same thing.
If,

1149
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.780
if I get told to do something that's morally or ethically wrong and I do it,

1150
01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:01.600
well,
guess what?
Then I'm responsible for that.
What?

1151
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:06.630
What becomes a little bit complicated to me or adds another layer of complexity

1152
01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:07.534
is this,

1153
01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:13.240
if I'm going to sand creek and I'm with [inaudible] and he's or Shillington and

1154
01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:17.590
he says,
Hey,
we're going to go there and we're going to execute this and we're,

1155
01:07:17.591 --> 01:07:19.750
we're,
we're going to kill these guys.
We're going to,

1156
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:24.340
we're going to conduct a raid,
and I don't believe in it.

1157
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:28.120
Okay?
So I say,
you know what?
I don't believe in it.

1158
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:29.380
I don't think it's the right thing to do.

1159
01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:32.260
I think that we've made enough peace with them.
We've caused enough problems.

1160
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:35.170
That's their land.
I'm not going.
Okay,

1161
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:38.560
so now you don't go because you didn't believe in the mission.
Well,

1162
01:07:38.561 --> 01:07:39.850
now who's out there conducting the mission?

1163
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:43.570
Everyone that's going out there to conduct the mission is people that are

1164
01:07:43.571 --> 01:07:46.630
compliant with what he's saying.
So you would be,

1165
01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:51.880
you would be morally a better person if you said,
okay,

1166
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:55.450
I'm going to go ahead and do this because if I don't,

1167
01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.220
I know it's going to be someone that's totally compliant with Shillington and

1168
01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.980
I'd rather be there to at least spare some of the people,

1169
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.870
which we know people did.
And so there's,

1170
01:08:07.871 --> 01:08:10.270
there's a little complexity.
No,
I talk about this in the business world too.

1171
01:08:10.271 --> 01:08:14.110
People say,
my boss told me to do this and,
and I,
I think it's a bad idea.

1172
01:08:14.111 --> 01:08:18.140
I don't think we should do it.
Okay,
so are you going to get put off the project?

1173
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.850
Are you going to get pulled to a different,

1174
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.430
a different department where you no longer can take care because you listened

1175
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.900
too hard on my people.
I'm not,
I refuse to do this.
Okay,
that's fine.

1176
01:08:26.901 --> 01:08:27.950
You refuse to do this.

1177
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:31.370
I'll put someone in there that won't refuse and you no longer can protect your

1178
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:33.730
people and your people in a worse situation.
Yup.

1179
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:38.540
So degraded the whole organization.
So you raise your hand,

1180
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:43.550
you make your protest,
but sometimes you've got to say,
okay,

1181
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:48.530
I've made my protest and I understand that you're still wanting me to do this

1182
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.720
and even though I think it's the wrong thing to do,

1183
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.760
I'm going to proceed down the path because I'd rather me be able to mitigate as

1184
01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:59.420
much of this problem as I can.
Then have somebody that's just going to do,
do,

1185
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.510
do this to the fullest extent that you would want them to do.

1186
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.900
So there's another additional complexity there that

1187
01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.720
<v 2>it gets involved because some time,
as you said,</v>

1188
01:09:09.721 --> 01:09:12.830
just the nine you're just making your Southfield better.

1189
01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:15.300
But the reality is that plan is going to go ahead.

1190
01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:18.330
You are the only thing that stands in the way of that plan.

1191
01:09:18.331 --> 01:09:20.970
Going to the 100 percentile.

1192
01:09:20.971 --> 01:09:24.370
You can bring it down to 50 you know he's still going to feel agony.

1193
01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:27.000
You're still going to feel part of something you don't want to be part of.

1194
01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:31.530
But the only thing you do by refusing is patting yourself on the back and say,

1195
01:09:31.531 --> 01:09:35.210
am I an author?
Morado guy.
He's like,
yeah,
but no,
cause you know,

1196
01:09:35.211 --> 01:09:39.450
it's like the thing is you can use that power in that situation too for

1197
01:09:39.451 --> 01:09:42.010
something that is better than if you just,
uh,

1198
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:45.480
look yourself in the mirror or saying how great you are by not doing it.

1199
01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:48.550
And in fact,
that's what it was pitching Canadian bill about the sun,

1200
01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:53.010
clique story,
Silas Soul,
you know,
he's told right before,

1201
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:57.540
if you don't want stay home,
nobody's forcing you or just stay home.

1202
01:09:57.541 --> 01:10:01.320
Don't be part of it.
And Solon Kramer and some of those guys say,
no,

1203
01:10:01.321 --> 01:10:02.220
we want to be there.

1204
01:10:02.221 --> 01:10:06.270
We want to be dare cooled served may be able to make the choice on this fault.

1205
01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.600
And uh,
and he makes a huge difference right there.

1206
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.090
<v 1>My feeling on it,</v>

1207
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.540
just sort of looking at it all from the outside is that especially in a

1208
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:15.830
counterinsurgency war,

1209
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:21.040
that without strict military discipline in strong leadership that abject

1210
01:10:22.371 --> 01:10:24.920
savagery is gravity will take you there.

1211
01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:27.980
That's where things will head on their own.

1212
01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.840
Unless you are supremely focused on discipline and leadership and education and

1213
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:34.460
those kinds of things that you don't have to,

1214
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:38.180
you don't really have to ask the question,
how can this kind of thing happen?

1215
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.680
The real question is how does this not happen all the time,
right?

1216
01:10:42.681 --> 01:10:46.860
How is it that American soldiers in Iraq and uh,

1217
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.380
you know,
you go into Iraq and they're seeing,
uh,

1218
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.001
maybe,

1219
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:57.110
maybe husbands and fathers that they spoke to the previous day that they know

1220
01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:58.100
are innocent,

1221
01:10:58.101 --> 01:11:02.960
not part of the fighting and they see his wife beheaded and him with a power

1222
01:11:02.961 --> 01:11:04.520
drill hole on the side of his head.

1223
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:09.560
How our American soldiers not going and executing reprisal attacks against these

1224
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:10.580
people all the time.

1225
01:11:10.581 --> 01:11:15.581
How has it not just completely getting out of hand like that to me is by far the

1226
01:11:15.961 --> 01:11:19.650
more interesting question.
I don't have to ask myself,
how is it that you know,

1227
01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:22.850
somebody went and shut up,
you know,
the,
the,

1228
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.830
the house of the person who did something like that.

1229
01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:28.550
That's an easy question to answer.
And,
and the,

1230
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.450
the much more interesting one is how it doesn't happen all the time and it,
it,

1231
01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:36.100
it seems like it's,
it has to be institutional.
It can't come down to like,
uh,

1232
01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:38.460
you know,
institutional culture,
right?

1233
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:43.050
I'm relating it to their sense of personal identity and social identity with the

1234
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:47.340
group that this is not who we are.
Um,
that if I do this,

1235
01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:49.770
it's not going to win me any,
uh,

1236
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.860
any Kudos from my teammates or anything like that.

1237
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:56.640
There you're going to look at that as a betrayal because I'm bringing dishonor

1238
01:11:56.641 --> 01:11:58.740
upon us because this is not what we're about.

1239
01:11:58.741 --> 01:12:01.590
And they have to be able to look at it that way.
And if they don't know that,

1240
01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:05.400
if they don't know that,
uh,
by doing something like that,

1241
01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:08.790
they're going to,
uh,
you know,
they want to blend in with the group.

1242
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.110
They want to be accepted by the group.

1243
01:12:10.111 --> 01:12:12.330
They want to be looked at as somebody that can be relied on.

1244
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:16.790
And that has to mean following the rules and doing the right thing.

1245
01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.470
<v 0>Yeah.
Well did Danielle,
you poured it,
pointed this out earlier,
you,
you said,</v>

1246
01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:26.150
well this seems like it's just the communications aspect is so important and

1247
01:12:26.151 --> 01:12:30.560
that's 100% right.
So as we all know,
the,
the

1248
01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:37.150
strategy in the Vietnam War for America was to kill more of them.

1249
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:42.680
Then they data Voss and drop more bombs on them and eventually they'll just

1250
01:12:42.681 --> 01:12:45.620
break just a war of attrition.
And,
and so the,

1251
01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:49.580
the strategy was get rack up as many kill,

1252
01:12:49.581 --> 01:12:53.840
count as high kill count as you possibly can.
So that's the messaging.

1253
01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.990
That's the messaging.
So when that's the messaging,

1254
01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.100
that's the messaging in,
in Iraq,

1255
01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.360
they were very clear about,
hey,
we're here too.

1256
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.370
We're not an occupying force.

1257
01:13:07.371 --> 01:13:10.970
We're here to liberate these people were here to secure the populous and make

1258
01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:14.210
sure that they can have a free country.
That's the messaging.

1259
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.970
So does that messaging always make it down to the front lines?
Know,

1260
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.990
that's why we do have incidents where,
you know,
bad,
horrible things happen.

1261
01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:21.883
Absolutely.

1262
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:27.250
But it is about the messaging and it is about everyone understanding why they're

1263
01:13:27.501 --> 01:13:29.480
doing what they're doing,
what their mission is,

1264
01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:33.200
what is what is right and what is wrong.

1265
01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:36.710
And you can be educated on that legally,
hey,

1266
01:13:36.711 --> 01:13:40.700
you're not allowed to do this.
You can do that,
but you can't do this.

1267
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.720
And then the other point that you made,
which is,
well,

1268
01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:47.510
you said you gotta be able to manage people in a time of crisis as a leader,

1269
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.850
but more important.
And you,
you actually,

1270
01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:54.290
you actually asked a really complicated question and then answer it yourself.

1271
01:13:54.291 --> 01:13:57.650
And you did that like three times and that one sphere of conversation that you

1272
01:13:57.651 --> 01:14:01.730
had with yourself.
Yeah,
yeah.
Is,
is you said,
you know,

1273
01:14:01.731 --> 01:14:06.020
you gotta be able to manage people in these pressure situations and then you

1274
01:14:06.021 --> 01:14:08.960
added that.
But what you really need is culture.
And you're right,

1275
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:13.780
because you're not going to be there.
The leader is not,
I wasn't with my,

1276
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:16.660
all my elements on the battlefield all the time.

1277
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:19.570
They were out there all the time without me all the time without me.

1278
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.830
They were the ones that had to understand what they could and what they couldn't

1279
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:26.710
do.
They were the ones that had to make those hard decisions.

1280
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:30.850
They weren't calling my snipers,
didn't call back to me and say,
Hey Jocko,

1281
01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:31.810
I see this with this guy.

1282
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:34.810
They didn't even ask their platoon commanders that they didn't ask anyone.

1283
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.910
They knew what the rules of engagement,
where they knew what our strategy was.

1284
01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:43.720
They understood.
And one of the things that I told them,
you know,

1285
01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:46.150
speaking of rules of engagement,
so our rules of engagement was,
you know,

1286
01:14:46.151 --> 01:14:51.151
several page legal document written by some lawyers in Washington DC or

1287
01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:54.010
wherever.
And you know,

1288
01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:59.011
I've got kids in my platoon that are 20 2122 years old,

1289
01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:00.620
you know,

1290
01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:04.810
high school graduate and they came in the seal teams like I did by the way.

1291
01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.500
And so they're looking at a legal document like that,
does it?

1292
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:10.040
It doesn't mean anything to them.
You know,

1293
01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:13.660
my rules of engagement for them was it very simple.
Make sure that people,

1294
01:15:13.661 --> 01:15:18.640
you're killing our bad.
You make sure that people,
you're killing her bat and why.

1295
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:20.950
And then I explained to them why that was important.

1296
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:26.100
And the reason why that was important was because the day that some civilians

1297
01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.880
brought a headless body that it had taken a 300 win mag round to the head and

1298
01:15:34.091 --> 01:15:38.400
their head was gone and they said this was our a mom or this was our school

1299
01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:38.920
teacher,

1300
01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.540
or this was our neighborhood doctor and one of your snipers killed them and they

1301
01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:47.980
would figure it out.
It was us.
First of all,
our operations would get shut down.

1302
01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:51.820
So selfishly we don't want to get our operations shutdown,

1303
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:55.090
but more important than the selfish reason.
If that happened,

1304
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.410
we would leave all the soldiers and marines that we were working with on a daily

1305
01:15:59.411 --> 01:16:01.110
basis that we are providing Overwatch for.

1306
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.710
We've leave them without the support that we had committed to give them because

1307
01:16:05.711 --> 01:16:09.430
we weren't allowed to operate anymore because we weren't being discriminatory

1308
01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:13.060
enough with our fire.
So the culture is so important.

1309
01:16:13.061 --> 01:16:16.150
People understanding why they're doing what they're doing is so important.

1310
01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.010
And if you don't get that messaging into your point,
DNA,
Daniella,

1311
01:16:20.011 --> 01:16:23.680
if you don't get the communication correct,

1312
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:26.260
then you're going to end up in a world of hurt

1313
01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:31.120
<v 2>and to point you just made the,
make sure the people you key or bad.</v>

1314
01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:35.290
He's such a,
I think about a day or so few awards,
right?

1315
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.420
You say teen lake,
very,

1316
01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:40.840
very few words and yet he's so centered because you look at,

1317
01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:45.330
not all the sanctuary core me lie,
but Luca,
even like half of the,

1318
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.520
you know when the Nazi seeing invade the Soviet Union and then when the Red Army

1319
01:16:50.591 --> 01:16:53.110
does the counter and they start invading Germany,

1320
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.220
both armies horrible seeings to one another.
Cv Leon.

1321
01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:01.960
And the idea is,
well the Nazis did to our people.
So we did it today.

1322
01:17:01.961 --> 01:17:06.220
Our swell that Ma'am that you are shooting in the head at it.

1323
01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:09.010
She had nothing to do with what happened to your people.
She's,

1324
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.810
she's not the Nazi soldier would eat it.

1325
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:14.990
She's not the bad one just because she's from the same nation.

1326
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.720
Are you kidding me?
That's not,
that doesn't make her a bad person.

1327
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:22.160
And I think that's part of the problem.
We group identity that so often.

1328
01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:26.300
That's why stereotypes are dangerous because you start grouping individuals into

1329
01:17:26.301 --> 01:17:30.590
this mental category you may have of like those guys are bad.

1330
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:36.130
That individual only share some physical characteristic with the other one they

1331
01:17:36.711 --> 01:17:40.040
share.
Maybe the [inaudible] are related,
but they are not the same person.

1332
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.260
You know the date,
I haven't made the same choices.

1333
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:43.850
They haven't committed the same action.

1334
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:47.440
So the fact that you three told the Cheyenne the same or you decided to retool

1335
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:50.540
the Vietnamese the same or the Germans,
the same old,
the Russians,

1336
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.790
that's where every single is wrong because he or not making sure that the person

1337
01:17:55.791 --> 01:17:59.030
you're hurting is the bad one is not the one.

1338
01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.670
There's no right Vange dare are not the same people.

1339
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:05.360
And so and yet it happens over and over again.

1340
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.400
Where people fall into this idea of group mentality is,

1341
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:14.080
well I couldn't catch that guy back is one of the or group is I know man,

1342
01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.720
there are individuals that are involved that are not,

1343
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:21.800
there's no collective guilt off.
It's kind of the same reason why,
for example,

1344
01:18:21.801 --> 01:18:25.550
federal reasons strike as I saw all fall in every possible way because you're

1345
01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:28.130
now going against the guide.
I have a grievance against.

1346
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:30.470
You're going against the guy from the same nation.

1347
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:35.000
It's like that has nothing to do with one another.
You know,
they're,

1348
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:40.010
I feel like sometimes group identity,
it's one of those double edged swords,

1349
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:44.240
right?
Because on one hand there's a side of it that we mentioned earlier.

1350
01:18:44.241 --> 01:18:49.241
Maybe your loyalty to your group and not wanting to bring dishonor upon them if

1351
01:18:49.401 --> 01:18:53.660
that's the culture is what keeps you from putting a bullet in the head of the

1352
01:18:53.661 --> 01:18:58.400
guy you just cuffed.
Um,
you might be able to appeal to a,

1353
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:02.930
um,
you know,
you can say to people,
hey,

1354
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:06.980
we're Americans and this is not how we behave and you're appealing to their

1355
01:19:06.981 --> 01:19:10.160
group identity there,
you know,
and uh,
that

1356
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.970
nobody's saying it's a double edge sword.

1357
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:19.280
That is a case in which you are using group identities for as the good guys.
And,

1358
01:19:19.281 --> 01:19:20.180
and granted,
yeah,

1359
01:19:20.181 --> 01:19:23.870
it may not be that every single one from.com three really feed that idea by

1360
01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:27.350
you're putting a nice ideal and they are encouraging people to live up to it.

1361
01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.420
That's all that I didi furnace from.

1362
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:34.310
While it's similar in dynamics too damned bad guys and flagging everyone into

1363
01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:34.971
that group,

1364
01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:39.971
where do you know that that person really fit that stereotype or that you have

1365
01:19:40.281 --> 01:19:43.970
of dogs at all?
How did you make clear to your men,
uh,
when you said,
you know,

1366
01:19:43.971 --> 01:19:47.810
make sure that people you're killing or bad that they understood what was meant

1367
01:19:47.811 --> 01:19:48.644
by that.

1368
01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.920
<v 0>It is,
well there's first of all,</v>

1369
01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:57.240
there are specifics in the rules of engagement and one of them is called clear

1370
01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:00.090
hostile intent,
hostile actor,
hostile intent,

1371
01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:05.120
which means this person has to be doing something actively that's gonna cause it

1372
01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:07.440
cause a negative impact.
Now

1373
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:11.520
you can tell which people are bad.

1374
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.640
You can tell when they're starting to do something that's hostile actor hostile

1375
01:20:14.641 --> 01:20:18.840
intent.
You can tell.
And these guys,
you know,
my guys would,

1376
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.360
they knew they would err on the side of like,

1377
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:25.260
I'm going to make sure that this person is doing something bad.
But you know,

1378
01:20:25.261 --> 01:20:28.890
we had some decent,
uh,
arguments about the rules of engagement.

1379
01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.550
I had some decent arguments about the rules of engagement up the chain of

1380
01:20:32.551 --> 01:20:36.420
command because the rules of engagement were applying to all of Iraq.

1381
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:41.730
And Ramadi was not like the rest of Iraq at this time in 2006.
And you know,

1382
01:20:41.731 --> 01:20:45.990
if you've got someone that is,
for instance,

1383
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:51.210
observing a location with binoculars,
right?
If you're observing,

1384
01:20:51.211 --> 01:20:56.211
if you're in Baghdad and you're look looking at a location with binoculars,

1385
01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:02.010
you're gathering intelligence,
which is,
which,
which could be considered,

1386
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:05.940
which is not considered a hostile act.
It's,
it's,
it's the intelligence gathering.

1387
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.040
You might suspect the person being bad,
but there's,

1388
01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.950
there's no way to prove that in Ramadi.

1389
01:21:10.951 --> 01:21:15.951
If you saw somebody that was looking with binoculars at friendly forces,

1390
01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:17.820
they weren't gathering intelligence,

1391
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.620
they were absolutely coordinating attack and attack.
And that is,
uh,

1392
01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.110
that is a big difference because that is a hostile act.

1393
01:21:25.111 --> 01:21:27.630
And it's damn sure hostile intent.
And so,
you know,

1394
01:21:27.631 --> 01:21:31.290
those are the kinds of things that I would discuss up the chain of command and

1395
01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.970
we would provide them the resources.
You know,

1396
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.210
I talk a lot about playing the game,
right?

1397
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.170
Like if my boss tells me to do something,
I'm going to play the game.

1398
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.590
I'm going to try and do it.
And,
and,

1399
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.480
and occasionally I'll get the question of like,
well,

1400
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.750
what if you get told to do something that you really don't want to do?

1401
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.660
What if you got told to do something that you didn't,
that you were posed to,

1402
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.230
right?

1403
01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:55.470
What if you got the order to go to the me Lai massacre and you got the order?

1404
01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.930
Well,
yeah,
it's,
I know I'd say no.
And first of all,

1405
01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:03.930
that doesn't happen the closest,

1406
01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:09.290
the closest example I have to that happening was for me in Ramadi,

1407
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:15.140
we had been told that we had to take a certain number of Iraqi soldiers with us

1408
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:19.560
on every operation we conducted because we were trying to turn the war over to

1409
01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:19.980
them.

1410
01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:24.980
And so they needed to get out there and do operations and they were telling us

1411
01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:29.730
they were putting this,
this rule all over every American unit in Iraq.

1412
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.340
You needed to have an Iraqi face on every operation.

1413
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:35.580
So what did the Americans do?
What did,
what did the American units do?

1414
01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:36.930
What they did was they say,
okay,
yeah,

1415
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:40.260
we're going to take our platoon of 40 guys and we're going to take to Iraqis

1416
01:22:40.261 --> 01:22:41.580
with us,
and there's your Iraqi face.

1417
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.360
Well that doesn't move the the wharf forward.
They were obeying the rules.

1418
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:50.850
So the,
the senior leadership figured this out and said,
no,

1419
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:54.960
you guys are playing games.
He,
here's the new rule for every,

1420
01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:55.860
and I forget what the number was.

1421
01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:58.770
They made a ratio for every seven Americans that you have,

1422
01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.530
or for every one American you'd have to have,
you have,

1423
01:23:01.531 --> 01:23:04.140
you have to have seven Iraqi's are,
there were some numbers,
some ratio,

1424
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:06.220
and in Ramadi,

1425
01:23:06.221 --> 01:23:10.660
some of the units of Iraqis that we were working with only had 18 guys or 17

1426
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:11.440
guys.

1427
01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.730
And so that would have been me sending my guys in the field with two or three

1428
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:19.510
seals only,
which sending,
if you've got,

1429
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.270
if you're going to go into a bad area and you're going to,

1430
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.370
who are you going to send?
Because you want to have a radio man,

1431
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:27.520
you want to have a medic,
you want to have a guy that can call for fires.

1432
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:29.800
You want to have a leader and you want to have a couple heavy,

1433
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:34.280
heavy weapons guys,
that's,
that's six or seven guys right there.
Minimum,
right?

1434
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:38.080
And so when the chain of command told me,
hey,
you got to do this ratio,

1435
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:41.350
I looked at the ratio and the,
and I said,
hey guys,
uh,
in Ramadi,
that's,

1436
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:44.410
that's not a good idea and here's why I'm not gonna send my guys in the field

1437
01:23:44.411 --> 01:23:46.540
without a corpsman or without a radio man,

1438
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:49.660
without a Jay Tac or without a machine gunner.
I'm not,
I'm not going to do that.

1439
01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:54.970
And you know what they said?
They said,
that makes sense.
Jocko.
You proceed.

1440
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:58.600
Like if you articulate yourself correctly,

1441
01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:03.820
then you can get your point across.
Now head,
they said to me,
hey,

1442
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:06.100
listen,
no,
you're only allowed to do this.

1443
01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:09.340
Well then I would have objected further up the chain of command and I would not

1444
01:24:09.341 --> 01:24:12.640
have put my guys at risk to do something that didn't make sense.

1445
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:15.910
I'm not not going to do it.
Um,
and,
and again,

1446
01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:20.650
that's what I always encourage military people,
but not as military people.

1447
01:24:20.651 --> 01:24:21.350
Business people will,

1448
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:26.350
if you're the CEO of a company and you've given some directive that you don't

1449
01:24:27.761 --> 01:24:32.440
understand the full depth of the directive that you've given and your frontline

1450
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.861
somebody,

1451
01:24:32.861 --> 01:24:36.040
somebody in your front lines realizes that's going to have a hugely negative

1452
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:38.710
impact on your company.
Do you want them just to follow orders?

1453
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:40.500
You absolutely don't want them to followers.

1454
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:43.210
You want them to raise their hand and say,
hey boss,
this doesn't make sense.

1455
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:45.530
<v 2>And the thing,
yeah,
you said about,
yeah,</v>

1456
01:24:45.531 --> 01:24:49.340
you don't want to surround yourself with yes men,
which makes perfect sense.

1457
01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:50.570
Then again eats.

1458
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.190
It's one of the sinks where you really need to have work on yourself because the

1459
01:24:55.191 --> 01:24:59.690
reality is that most people have an ego.
Most people don't like to be told,

1460
01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.830
hey boss,
sorry about that doesn't sound right.
He's like,
what do you mean?

1461
01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.860
You know,
there's that reaction is like starting their pride,

1462
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:10.520
which of course that were old badness he shall making started going.

1463
01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.190
But he's a very nor actually,
you know what I mean?

1464
01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:16.840
He's like most people have to one degree or another and ego and his speech.

1465
01:25:16.841 --> 01:25:20.510
Shelly,
if like your guy maybe phrase it,
maybe they are right,
right.

1466
01:25:20.511 --> 01:25:21.470
The makeup falling toward,

1467
01:25:21.471 --> 01:25:24.140
they are pointing to something in your plan and doesn't work,

1468
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:26.510
but they phrase it in a way that's kind of blonde.

1469
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:30.260
So a you don't like being put approached the,

1470
01:25:30.261 --> 01:25:33.020
you don't like the tone by that point,

1471
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:35.780
even though they're content is perfectly correct.

1472
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.240
You're not eating it because it's like you have a better,

1473
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:41.120
I don't like you first year crazy of we and then you are going about it with

1474
01:25:41.121 --> 01:25:46.120
that tone.
The guy is just saying seeings plainly out they are,
maybe he's not,

1475
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:49.100
it hasn't have a bad tone is just not Cogley knew.

1476
01:25:49.101 --> 01:25:53.360
Wayne likes lowly Jane saying,
Hey,
let's see this way.

1477
01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:55.480
<v 0>And,
and you know what a guy in that,
cause I get the,</v>

1478
01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:58.030
I get that kind of question all the time with all the companies we work with.

1479
01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:01.870
I've got this guy and my boss has a big ego and I can't correct him because he

1480
01:26:01.871 --> 01:26:05.090
just,
he just gets a fee.
Well,
first of all,
when you just like you said,

1481
01:26:05.091 --> 01:26:08.000
if you've got a big ego and I tell you that your plan is wrong,

1482
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:11.840
I'm attacking a four to five position and you're only going to bolster your

1483
01:26:11.841 --> 01:26:12.950
position stronger.

1484
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:17.660
And so don't attack that position instead of simple technique that you can use

1485
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:21.950
is say,
hey boss,
I'm really not sure why we're using this approach.

1486
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:22.761
Could you explain this to me?

1487
01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.280
Because I want to make sure that I really understand what it is you want me to

1488
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:27.140
do.
And it seems like if I do this right here,

1489
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:29.090
it's going to cause this reaction and I don't want,

1490
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.560
I know you don't want that to happen,

1491
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:33.890
so could you just give me a hand and fully understanding what your plan is?

1492
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:35.930
And that way you're,
you're,
you're,

1493
01:26:35.931 --> 01:26:39.530
you're kind of massaging their ego a little bit and it opens their mind and

1494
01:26:39.531 --> 01:26:41.000
that's all you have to do is open up their ears.

1495
01:26:41.001 --> 01:26:44.420
That's the goal is just to open their ears a little bit so that you can start to

1496
01:26:44.421 --> 01:26:46.430
have a conversation with them and so that they can,

1497
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:50.150
going back to the whole topic of today so that they can see you as a human being

1498
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.810
with a,

1499
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:55.280
with an idea or an opinion that actually matters as opposed to seeing you as

1500
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:58.730
someone that's attacking their ego and that ego thing.
I mean,

1501
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.640
if you think about the wars that have been,
you know,

1502
01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:02.780
we always talk about the wars that are caused by religion,

1503
01:27:02.781 --> 01:27:06.020
but the wars that are caused by ego or are also pretty severe.

1504
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:10.400
And a lot of these incidents that we talk about,
these retaliatory incidences,

1505
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:12.620
well,
who's going to be the first person to say,

1506
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:17.060
you attacked my tribe and I'm going to let it slide.

1507
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:22.010
But that's,
that's,
that's a tough person.
That's a hard position to be in.

1508
01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.550
You're seen as weak.
You're seen as vulnerable.

1509
01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:28.340
You're seen as someone that can be pushed around.
So there's,

1510
01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:33.341
that's a very delicate game that you have to play and that causes problems in

1511
01:27:33.911 --> 01:27:36.770
that that ends up,
that's,
it's a game that's so hard to play.
In fact,

1512
01:27:36.771 --> 01:27:37.610
that most people,

1513
01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.140
or many people across the span of time have said,
no,

1514
01:27:42.141 --> 01:27:44.720
I'm not going to say that they did.
They drew blood.

1515
01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:46.760
We're going to draw more blood.

1516
01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:47.693
<v 1>Yup.
And it</v>

1517
01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.490
goes to what you were saying a second ago to your people have to know that

1518
01:27:53.491 --> 01:27:56.190
you're going to ask those questions of your leadership and that you're doing

1519
01:27:56.490 --> 01:27:58.890
that work because they got to trust you.
You know,

1520
01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:01.410
that way when Jocko comes to him and says,
hey guys,

1521
01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:04.260
I know this is gonna sound a little bit weird,

1522
01:28:04.261 --> 01:28:07.260
but here's what we're doing and here's who you're bringing with you and this is

1523
01:28:07.261 --> 01:28:11.070
what we're doing.
They know that if you're telling them to do it,

1524
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:12.960
it's gotta be done.

1525
01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:17.760
That every discussion has been had that every angle has been looked at,

1526
01:28:17.761 --> 01:28:20.040
that you've run it up the chain of command and registered.

1527
01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:21.900
You're a objections if they're there,

1528
01:28:22.170 --> 01:28:26.130
but they know that Jocko is not going to send us out to do something like this

1529
01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.290
unless it simply has to be done.

1530
01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:32.140
<v 0>And I get asked this question a lot,</v>

1531
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:37.590
well what do I do if one of my subordinates has a question about the way I've

1532
01:28:37.601 --> 01:28:42.370
planned something and I don't have a good answer?
What do I do?
Then I say,

1533
01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:45.040
well,
what you do then is you listen to them.

1534
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:48.100
You actually listened to what they're saying.
Because if,
if,

1535
01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:53.250
if I've told you to do something and you've then responded with some reason why

1536
01:28:53.951 --> 01:28:57.790
we shouldn't do that thing and I can't explain away your reason,

1537
01:28:57.910 --> 01:29:00.880
then probably I'm wrong.
And,
and as a leader,

1538
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:05.100
this is another thing where our ego plays a role as a leader.
Our Ego says,
well,

1539
01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:07.260
if I admit that I'm wrong to the troops,

1540
01:29:07.261 --> 01:29:09.060
they're gonna think I'm up there going to think I don't know what I'm doing.

1541
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.770
The opposite is actually true.

1542
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.340
If I was in charge of youtube and I presented you with a plan and you guys came

1543
01:29:14.341 --> 01:29:17.130
back and today that plan's not smart.
And I said,

1544
01:29:17.131 --> 01:29:20.820
shut up and do it the way I told you,
you don't respect me more.

1545
01:29:20.850 --> 01:29:24.090
You respect me less.
And if,

1546
01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:26.670
if I came to you two with a plan and said,
hey guys,

1547
01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.350
here's the way we're going to execute this.
And you say,
Hey,

1548
01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:31.680
that's not a good idea.
We should do it a different way.
And I say,
okay,

1549
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:34.680
well what do you recommend?
And we come together with a collaborative plan.

1550
01:29:34.681 --> 01:29:36.690
You don't think less of me as leader.
As a matter of fact,

1551
01:29:36.691 --> 01:29:37.860
you think more of me as a leader,

1552
01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:41.310
you think that I'm a humble guy that will listen and take input.
And by the way,

1553
01:29:41.490 --> 01:29:43.560
bonuses,
you all now have real,

1554
01:29:43.561 --> 01:29:46.440
true ownership of the plan and we all feel good about it.

1555
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:47.850
And when you guys go on the field,

1556
01:29:47.851 --> 01:29:51.960
you execute it to the utmost of your ability because it's something that you
own.

1557
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:55.320
<v 1>It's amazing how everything you're saying is,</v>

1558
01:29:55.380 --> 01:30:00.380
it's as if you took a list of all the traits of Lieutenant Calley at me lie and

1559
01:30:00.391 --> 01:30:03.030
literally just said,
do the opposite of all these things.

1560
01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:07.350
He was a guy who couldn't take criticism from his men,
100% who asserted a,

1561
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:11.150
you know,
who,
who pulled rank anytime anything like that happened.
Uh,

1562
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:16.220
who was a complete transparent yes man to his captain above him who was just

1563
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:20.550
never ask any questions.
I mean,
just right down the line.
And as a result,

1564
01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:24.480
his men had no trust in him so that when they got into a situation that was

1565
01:30:24.481 --> 01:30:24.960
chaotic,

1566
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.130
they felt like they were standing out on the corner by themselves in a country

1567
01:30:29.131 --> 01:30:31.290
they didn't understand with nobody looking out for them.

1568
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:35.220
I don't want to say this in a way that makes it sound like I'm trying to justify

1569
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:36.330
anything they did,
of course not.

1570
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:41.660
But you put men in a situation where they feel like they're in complete chaos

1571
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:46.620
and they happen to have automatic weapons in their hands.
Well,

1572
01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.220
if I find myself in a situation where I'm completely overwhelmed by chaos,

1573
01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:53.280
that automatic weapons probably going to start to look like the best tool I have

1574
01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.290
for structuring my involvement.

1575
01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:58.690
<v 0>Yeah.
There's a,
and obviously this went way beyond that.
Uh,
years ago,</v>

1576
01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:02.080
I forget how many years ago there was a shooting in New York City,
uh,

1577
01:31:02.110 --> 01:31:05.590
I think it was 38 rounds were fired at uh,

1578
01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:09.640
maybe a homeless person,
an unarmed person.
I forget the situation,

1579
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:13.630
but there's a lot of people that just couldn't believe that all these,

1580
01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:19.120
all these police officers shot at this unarmed individual,

1581
01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:23.680
horrible situation.
And again,
I always,
I've always will say this,

1582
01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:28.390
like whenever I talk about bad police shootings,
I been on ride alongs with cops.

1583
01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:32.580
I've done hits with cops.
It's a freaking hard job.
And,
and,

1584
01:31:32.730 --> 01:31:35.620
and I'm not a guy that,
I've done that a couple times here and there,

1585
01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:39.250
but go out on that beat every day and deal with those scumbags of the world

1586
01:31:39.251 --> 01:31:43.420
every single day.
And you're going to have,
it's going to be,
it's the freedom.

1587
01:31:43.450 --> 01:31:46.450
It's one of the hardest jobs in the world,
that situation people to,

1588
01:31:46.451 --> 01:31:50.080
how the hell did that happen?
Well,
there's,

1589
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:54.670
there's a lot of tension in a situation that emotions are high,

1590
01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:56.680
people are screaming,
we're not trained well.

1591
01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.550
Everyone is sitting there with their slack out the trigger and when that first

1592
01:32:00.551 --> 01:32:03.760
bang happens,
it's a,
it's a chain reaction.
That's one.

1593
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:06.400
One of the situations that,
you know,

1594
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:10.870
I would see with my guys that was beautiful in Ramadi was they wouldn't do that

1595
01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.170
if,
if one of the snipers took appointed shot at someone,

1596
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:17.170
they would take the point of shot and the others would hold fire,

1597
01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:22.030
check fire until,
you know,
the,
the situation either evolved or,
or deescalated.

1598
01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.890
But the,

1599
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:29.080
the army was always quite impressed with the fact that we would take really

1600
01:32:29.081 --> 01:32:32.470
surgical shots at bad guys and there wouldn't be,
you know,

1601
01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:38.260
massive amounts of collateral damage.
Again,
sometimes it's unavoidable,
but

1602
01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:40.250
<v 1>maybe you can talk a little bit about that.</v>

1603
01:32:40.251 --> 01:32:44.210
Cause I think that's one thing that gets really lost on a lot of people saying.

1604
01:32:44.211 --> 01:32:47.210
I think there's a lot of propaganda that helps it get lost.
You know,

1605
01:32:47.211 --> 01:32:52.211
there's no question that there's been an evolution and our values and our

1606
01:32:53.151 --> 01:32:54.880
relationship to these kinds of things over the years.

1607
01:32:54.881 --> 01:32:59.040
So you go back to something like Sand Creek,
1864,
uh,

1608
01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:02.810
there might not have been a whole lot of people shedding too many tears over

1609
01:33:02.811 --> 01:33:06.350
what happened.
You get up to me lie and you know,

1610
01:33:06.351 --> 01:33:10.040
there's some controversy and there's some,
you know,
there's a cover up,

1611
01:33:10.041 --> 01:33:11.000
all those kinds of things.

1612
01:33:11.001 --> 01:33:15.410
But once it comes out and it's laid bare and the evidence is clear,

1613
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:18.050
things had changed from 1864,
and that,

1614
01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:22.160
that incident and a few other incidents that were going on that made it out,

1615
01:33:22.161 --> 01:33:24.980
or a few pictures that came out,
it turned people against the war.

1616
01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:29.730
They decided that this is not worth putting our men in a situation where we're

1617
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:33.650
going to be doing things like this.
This is not worth it.
And you get up to today,

1618
01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:38.600
uh,
in the Iraq war,
something like Abu Ghraib,
which is an unacceptable situation,

1619
01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:43.700
but we're talking about prisoner abuse.
That doesn't,

1620
01:33:43.701 --> 01:33:46.860
uh,
th th th that wouldn't cause,
uh,

1621
01:33:46.861 --> 01:33:50.360
the people who are working in that prison five years before that,

1622
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:55.440
the Iraqis who worked for Saddam,
that wouldn't even,
you know,
they,

1623
01:33:55.441 --> 01:33:59.280
they wouldn't even make it through their filter.
Right.
So,
I mean,
what,

1624
01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:02.450
what was going on there with the American soldiers,
it was,
it was not okay,

1625
01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.190
but it wasn't walking into a village and mastering 500 people.
It wasn't,

1626
01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:09.003
uh,
you know,

1627
01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.150
brutal torture in the same way that we would think of what was going on before

1628
01:34:14.151 --> 01:34:15.470
we took control of that prison.

1629
01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:20.480
And yet our response to that in the military's response to it once it came out

1630
01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:24.950
was pretty dramatic.
I mean,
it was theirs and it was quick.
It didn't,

1631
01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.590
there was not as much of a delay as soon as it comes out.
There's,

1632
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:30.260
so there's a clear shift that's going on there.
If,

1633
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:34.250
if even primarily from the standpoint of it's just,
it's a breach and discipline,

1634
01:34:34.251 --> 01:34:35.570
that's not how you behave.

1635
01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:36.851
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
and,</v>

1636
01:34:36.851 --> 01:34:41.851
and one of the things that I'd talk about with my guys is because you got to

1637
01:34:41.921 --> 01:34:44.830
frame this right because you,
you know,

1638
01:34:44.831 --> 01:34:48.820
you mentioned earlier that if you had to dealt with this person that had cut the

1639
01:34:48.821 --> 01:34:51.580
heads off of the three year old girl yesterday and now you,

1640
01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:56.440
you had him cuffed and knew it was him,
that guy deserves a bullet,
right?
I,
Hey,

1641
01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.590
I agree with you.
That guy deserves a bullet.
The problem is,

1642
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:03.740
well number one,
it's a breakdown in discipline,

1643
01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:08.800
but to me more important and what I would tell my guys is if we behave that way,

1644
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:16.330
we have a significant chance of strategically negatively impacting our war

1645
01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:21.740
effort.
So I get that you want to kill these bad guys,

1646
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:25.700
but more important than us killing these bad guys as us winning this war.

1647
01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:28.340
And so if we run around doing dumb things,

1648
01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:30.560
we're going to have a negative strategic impact on the,

1649
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:35.090
and that was actually always the biggest worry as a leader is you don't want to

1650
01:35:35.091 --> 01:35:38.200
have some,
something happened where you know,
you,

1651
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:41.480
you drop a bomb on the wrong area or you know,

1652
01:35:41.481 --> 01:35:43.670
in a bunch of civilians get killed or you know,

1653
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:45.770
you don't want to have that thing happen.
That's a real,

1654
01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:51.700
and the effort and lengths that American forces go to to prevent civilian

1655
01:35:52.341 --> 01:35:56.530
casualties is,
it's incredible.
I don't think most people have any idea.
No,

1656
01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:57.670
they don't.
They don't works.

1657
01:35:57.930 --> 01:36:00.550
<v 2>And I think that's why we're the coolest things about creatine,</v>

1658
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:04.510
a certain methodology that people would want to live up to the first time you

1659
01:36:04.511 --> 01:36:05.740
say it,
he may not be through,

1660
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:09.880
he may be a wishful thinking that you hired those people and you're not quite

1661
01:36:09.881 --> 01:36:14.190
there.
But as people keep repeating eighth and your aunt again and again,
we'd,

1662
01:36:14.191 --> 01:36:17.980
the fact that your behavior doesn't match your ideas more and more people we

1663
01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:20.170
keep working on trying to actually build that thing.

1664
01:36:20.171 --> 01:36:22.020
They don't want to feel that like hypocrites.

1665
01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:24.370
They actually want to live up to that idea.

1666
01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:29.850
And that's one of the sinks were why is sometimes people get turned off by when

1667
01:36:29.921 --> 01:36:33.630
you have these high minded id,
I'll end this very poor behavior.
Or they're like,

1668
01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:34.820
oh,
look at that hypocrisy.

1669
01:36:34.890 --> 01:36:38.920
They SAIDI seeing Sunday domain it while sometime when you say it long enough,

1670
01:36:38.921 --> 01:36:42.160
people actually do want to live up to it.
Then they do change their behavior.

1671
01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:45.670
So while the theory may not match the practice,
when you start,

1672
01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:47.620
if you keep at it long enough,

1673
01:36:47.650 --> 01:36:51.860
the practice may try to inch closer to mention that theory ideals,

1674
01:36:52.150 --> 01:36:55.340
not a bad thing.
I mean,
I,
I,
you can take it

1675
01:36:55.430 --> 01:37:00.340
<v 1>to uh,
uh,
political context,
right?
When people can point back at,
uh,</v>

1676
01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:05.120
the United States say before the 1960s and before the civil war and point to the

1677
01:37:05.121 --> 01:37:08.570
Constitution and declaration of independence in these high minded ideas and

1678
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:12.020
people love to be the cynical one that says,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1679
01:37:12.021 --> 01:37:16.220
but slavery and of course,
but this and that.
And yeah,
totally,

1680
01:37:16.221 --> 01:37:18.650
totally true.
But the,
the,

1681
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.070
the conclusion to draw from that is not that,
uh,

1682
01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.060
the ideals don't matter or that they're just on paper.

1683
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.990
The fact that those ideals where there was what allowed the civil rights

1684
01:37:29.991 --> 01:37:34.720
movement to eventually come into being,
that's what gave us the room.

1685
01:37:34.721 --> 01:37:37.640
And in fact,
you could even say that the thing we're talking about,

1686
01:37:37.641 --> 01:37:41.450
the same thing,
uh,
that gap between ideal and reality.

1687
01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.980
One Way to talk about that is hypocrisy.
But at the same time,
that gap,

1688
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:47.600
that opening is,

1689
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:52.220
that's the opening where people realize that and say there is a gap between our

1690
01:37:52.221 --> 01:37:56.670
professed ideals and,
and it makes room for that of positive change.
Right?
I mean,

1691
01:37:56.671 --> 01:37:58.040
you can go back,
uh,

1692
01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:03.260
there was the Mongols were never ever going to give up slavery because their

1693
01:38:03.601 --> 01:38:05.960
moral system didn't have room for that.
Yeah.

1694
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:09.000
And so you could go up to them and say,
well,

1695
01:38:09.001 --> 01:38:13.050
how dare you enslave these people and they're not going to get defensive.

1696
01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.890
They're going to look at you like you're crazy because there's no room for that.

1697
01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:21.180
You know,
for that gap,
that idea doesn't even exist.
Right.
Right.

1698
01:38:21.181 --> 01:38:25.230
And so the ideal is matter and when,
uh,
when,
when they're broken,
um,
you know,

1699
01:38:25.231 --> 01:38:25.800
again,

1700
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:30.330
I think that there's a motivation on the part of a lot of people who are,

1701
01:38:30.331 --> 01:38:31.950
who are more cynical than they should be,

1702
01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.220
a given the country that they're fortunate enough to live in,
you know.
Um,

1703
01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:41.220
and this is something that you get from going overseas to a lot of places.

1704
01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:44.160
It's something certainly that I got from spending so much time in Africa.

1705
01:38:44.161 --> 01:38:46.500
The Middle East for work is,
boy,

1706
01:38:46.501 --> 01:38:50.940
you come back after the first trip to over to those places and you realize you

1707
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:54.090
want to kiss the ground when you get off that airplane and you want to go around

1708
01:38:54.091 --> 01:38:56.160
and just hug everybody.
You see,

1709
01:38:56.250 --> 01:39:00.600
because you were so fortunate to live in a place where things that we absolutely

1710
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:05.270
take for granted over here are miracles.
And,
um,
you know,

1711
01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:10.190
I think,
uh,
one of the things I did really didn't want to do,
um,

1712
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:13.510
when I was talking about me lying that episode,
um,

1713
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:18.870
I stayed very focused on the,
uh,
the incident itself,
sort of.

1714
01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:23.700
Um,
because I,
you don't want to,

1715
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:27.100
you don't want to be making excuses for something like that and you don't want

1716
01:39:27.101 --> 01:39:31.980
to make it seem like you're trying to gloss over and atrocity.
Um,

1717
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:33.263
but,

1718
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:38.090
but you don't want to,
uh,

1719
01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:41.030
<v 2>give fuel to that idea that like this is,</v>

1720
01:39:41.031 --> 01:39:45.260
this speaks to like a larger problem in our society because I just don't believe

1721
01:39:45.261 --> 01:39:46.980
that,
right?

1722
01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:51.380
If you start pushing the button to match in the direction of making apologies

1723
01:39:51.381 --> 01:39:55.800
for where laughter,
all we are good guys and there are a few exceptions by Luke.

1724
01:39:55.801 --> 01:40:00.140
We are,
we stand for freedom and democracy.
He's like,
yeah,
maybe,

1725
01:40:00.141 --> 01:40:04.280
but let's not be so quick about sweeping under the rug.
All the bad stuff.

1726
01:40:04.281 --> 01:40:08.000
Let's look at it.
The guys,
we instead of push on the button of,
Hey,

1727
01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:09.170
look at all the bad stuff.

1728
01:40:09.171 --> 01:40:12.800
That means that all of these ideas are crap and it's not real and it's solely

1729
01:40:12.801 --> 01:40:15.740
Parker's.
He's like,
Whoa,
slow down on a second.
Yeah,

1730
01:40:15.741 --> 01:40:19.190
you've got a couple of points where you are right by are also missing the boat.

1731
01:40:19.191 --> 01:40:22.210
It's like,
it's almost like,
and that happens in most discussion,

1732
01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:26.570
like in most situations,
you rarely have somebody with 100% wrong,

1733
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:31.010
is that they take a powershell throats and they take it too far and they lose

1734
01:40:31.011 --> 01:40:33.170
perspective of the other side of the equation.

1735
01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:38.000
People don't understand like American soldiers were killed and maimed,
uh,

1736
01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:43.300
in situations that absolutely could have been avoided if we disregarded our

1737
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:45.890
rules of engagement.
And if we made,
like,

1738
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:49.970
we made conscious decisions to put ourselves at risk when we did not have to

1739
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.880
because we were trying to be sensitive to the environment and to the people that

1740
01:40:52.881 --> 01:40:53.714
were.

1741
01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:58.840
And I don't think enough people recognize the historical anomaly that that is.

1742
01:40:58.930 --> 01:41:01.170
I mean,
that is just a,
you can't,
for,

1743
01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:06.240
for thousands of years of human history that is just completely unthinkable.

1744
01:41:06.401 --> 01:41:09.580
You couldn't imagine something like that.
And the extent to which we go,

1745
01:41:09.581 --> 01:41:11.650
I mean Jocko is talked about this before on his show,

1746
01:41:11.651 --> 01:41:15.400
the extent to which we go to try to make sure that the people,
you know,

1747
01:41:15.401 --> 01:41:19.450
the targets that we're,
that we're dealing with our targets.
Um,

1748
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.840
I think if more civilians had,
uh,
had,
uh,

1749
01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.680
an idea of that people would feel a lot different about,

1750
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:28.390
about what we do over there.
You know,

1751
01:41:28.391 --> 01:41:31.180
it doesn't mean that when something happens like ob of grave,

1752
01:41:31.181 --> 01:41:33.610
they're not going to,
uh,
react against that,

1753
01:41:33.611 --> 01:41:37.390
but they're going to react against it from a place of,
hey,
we're,

1754
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:41.390
we're a good country.
That shit is not going to fly.
All right?
That's not what,

1755
01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:44.950
you're not going to represent us that way.
And that's fine.

1756
01:41:44.951 --> 01:41:49.510
That's a healthy way to respond to something like that.
Um,
but you know,

1757
01:41:49.511 --> 01:41:53.060
again,
it was a political situation or whatever else is going on.
Like,
you know,

1758
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.810
people have more of a knee jerk reaction to those things that you're talking

1759
01:41:55.811 --> 01:41:58.750
about us.
You can get that sense.
It goes back to that,
uh,

1760
01:41:58.810 --> 01:42:00.610
Dan covered in approach to things,
right?

1761
01:42:00.611 --> 01:42:04.690
That ability to look at sinks one way and just when you're getting comfortable

1762
01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:08.980
with Dako conclusions to say,
yes,
maybe that is the conclusion we take,

1763
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:10.000
but it's not that easy.

1764
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:13.900
There's also a 20% from the other side that's not really wrong.

1765
01:42:13.901 --> 01:42:17.710
Then you food including that and that keeps you thinking on your toes.

1766
01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:19.000
You don't become dogmatic,

1767
01:42:19.001 --> 01:42:21.550
you don't become thinking purely black and white terms.

1768
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:26.440
You old way staff to have that nuance approach which and that's the problem.

1769
01:42:26.441 --> 01:42:27.430
That's the other pirate jokes.

1770
01:42:27.431 --> 01:42:29.770
He's most people that they can advance to mean weakness.

1771
01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:32.950
Then you can't make up your mind.
You are too wishy washy.

1772
01:42:32.951 --> 01:42:34.870
You are is not black.

1773
01:42:34.871 --> 01:42:38.020
He said off why two somewhere in there is like Mel.

1774
01:42:38.050 --> 01:42:43.050
That's also a weakness is the ability to look at things both ways and also make

1775
01:42:43.241 --> 01:42:47.440
a decision that's where can we can seen as when it's available.

1776
01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.160
And I think he's funny because so many of the things that joker brings up our so

1777
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:56.020
about really the kind of human being that you want to become.

1778
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.530
You know about self perfection really.
Cause that's what it boils down to,

1779
01:42:59.531 --> 01:43:00.131
which is Dan,

1780
01:43:00.131 --> 01:43:03.250
what makes you a great leader because there is no good leader without somebody

1781
01:43:03.251 --> 01:43:06.940
was working on themselves a lot and you know when you better get down to

1782
01:43:06.941 --> 01:43:10.950
depending suppose nothing sounds like it's that hard,
right?
He's all like,
okay,

1783
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:12.360
of course.
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1784
01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:16.090
So that completely and yet it's one of the Sikhs were,

1785
01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:20.320
while the theory may not be that hard,
the practices and the Atlanta team,

1786
01:43:20.321 --> 01:43:24.430
you have to be at it every single day or it's so easy.
It was leap.
There's,

1787
01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:25.841
there's a great line,

1788
01:43:25.841 --> 01:43:29.350
I need to doubt a chick that I was bad surely to dairy road.
We're driving down.

1789
01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.200
There's,
there's the law,
let's say may way.

1790
01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:36.130
He's very easy to understand and very easy to practice,

1791
01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:41.140
but nobody understands it.
Nobody trap.
And I love it because in tod,

1792
01:43:41.230 --> 01:43:42.640
yes,
it's not that bad.

1793
01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:47.680
It's fairly straightforward and yet there are so many steps along the way where

1794
01:43:47.690 --> 01:43:52.220
is easy to go their own path.
That is,
the theory is easy.

1795
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:55.500
<v 1>The practice cs,
you need to put in the work and there's no subsidy.</v>

1796
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:58.460
Each of those steps matters so much to,
because you know,

1797
01:43:58.490 --> 01:44:02.060
Jocko was talking about escalation in those situations.
The um,

1798
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:04.760
the book about the war in Chechnya,
you talked about,
I think the line,

1799
01:44:04.810 --> 01:44:08.720
I hadn't read the book until I heard your podcast on it and it just,

1800
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:11.540
it's one of those things that when you hear it,
it's so obvious.

1801
01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.720
But if you were to just step back from the context,

1802
01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:18.770
a little bit kind of seems ridiculous is which is that the savagery started when

1803
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:21.680
people stop shaving,
when soldiers stopped shaving.

1804
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:26.370
And I think part of the reason for something like that is,
uh,
once it is,

1805
01:44:26.371 --> 01:44:30.290
it's like the escalation.
It's like a ratchet.
Once you stopped shaving,

1806
01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.820
well now you're a unit that doesn't shave anymore.
Okay,
whatever.
Well,

1807
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:37.520
what that means is if you're a unit that lacks discipline,

1808
01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.840
well now your lack of discipline is not going to manifest,
is not shaving.

1809
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.930
You already don't shave.
That's normal.
That's totally normal.

1810
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:48.560
So now your lack of discipline is going to get to the next thing.

1811
01:44:48.561 --> 01:44:51.020
Now I'm not cleaning my weapons properly.

1812
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:54.020
And then pretty soon you're a unit that doesn't shave and doesn't clean your

1813
01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:56.990
weapons properly.
And that doesn't even seem like a lack of discipline anymore.

1814
01:44:57.020 --> 01:45:00.560
That just seems like daily life and now your lack of discipline or whatever it

1815
01:45:00.561 --> 01:45:03.680
is,
is going to go up to the next spot.
And it can happen with,
you know,

1816
01:45:03.681 --> 01:45:07.190
it can happen with just brutality and savagery and things like that as well.

1817
01:45:07.191 --> 01:45:11.690
We're now,
this kind of thing is just normal.
So if I'm angry,
uh,

1818
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:15.950
and it's totally normal for us to be able to smack these prisoners in the face,

1819
01:45:15.951 --> 01:45:18.680
but now I'm really pissed.
Well,
I'm not going to smack them in the face.

1820
01:45:18.681 --> 01:45:20.750
I smack him in the face anyway,
you know,

1821
01:45:20.751 --> 01:45:25.640
so I'm going to show my anger now by stepping it up and man,
well,
okay,
if that's,

1822
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:30.060
if that slides and the leadership doesn't step in,
well now that's normal.
We're,

1823
01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:34.580
you know,
we don't just smack soldiers,
we punched and kicked soldiers that once,

1824
01:45:34.581 --> 01:45:37.520
that's the baseline,
it ratchets up to that point.
Well,

1825
01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.760
it's going to escalate from there because you know,
that's kind of where it goes.

1826
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.630
And that's why catching those things right at the beginning and letting people

1827
01:45:44.631 --> 01:45:47.150
know that,
you know,
all of these things matter.

1828
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:49.910
I mean that's probably the life lesson.

1829
01:45:49.911 --> 01:45:53.510
A lot of the stuff you even talk about it,
everything matters.
It all matters.

1830
01:45:53.690 --> 01:45:57.710
<v 0>Yeah.
And not,
it takes some time.
Like I didn't,</v>

1831
01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:02.820
I didn't realize this when I was a 20 year old seal or a 25 year olds seal.

1832
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:08.630
You know,
I kind of started getting the indications and,
and that's why again,

1833
01:46:08.631 --> 01:46:12.650
you know,
I talk about training and leadership because that's what this stuff is,

1834
01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:16.250
you know,
putting somebody into a moral dilemma

1835
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:22.520
with no training is like putting someone onto the Jujitsu Mat with no training.

1836
01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:24.200
They're just going to get destroyed.

1837
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:27.020
Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen and they have no control over it.

1838
01:46:27.650 --> 01:46:31.280
And you know,
you got to think about these things.

1839
01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:36.380
You've got to think deeply about these things so that you have some sort of an

1840
01:46:36.381 --> 01:46:38.510
anchor that's grounded,

1841
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:41.990
that won't get ripped out at the first person that says,
hey shoot,

1842
01:46:41.991 --> 01:46:44.720
that three year old baby you,

1843
01:46:45.110 --> 01:46:49.710
you need to be grounded and have thought about these things in a deeper way.
And,

1844
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:55.310
and you know what you said about people swaying one way or the other.

1845
01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:03.020
You're right and people actually want to be led and they want to be led even

1846
01:47:05.071 --> 01:47:09.360
more.
So when there is a pressure situation going on,

1847
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.910
when there's something that,
that,

1848
01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:15.690
that you're not used to or that people aren't used to some kind of structure,

1849
01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.910
some,
some kind of stress or pressure,

1850
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:23.150
if you can step up and lead at that moment,
people are looking for,

1851
01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:25.280
they're looking for a leader and that was it.

1852
01:47:25.281 --> 01:47:28.830
I remember you were talking about one of the guys and be lie the six foot three

1853
01:47:28.831 --> 01:47:31.080
guy and he's a natural leader,
right?

1854
01:47:31.110 --> 01:47:34.170
He's a natural leader that people kind of followed in what he started going

1855
01:47:34.171 --> 01:47:39.060
sideways and started just getting completely savage and brutal people just

1856
01:47:39.061 --> 01:47:43.920
Kinda,
okay.
You know,
he's the guy,
you know,
like,
okay,
that guy's stepping up and,

1857
01:47:43.921 --> 01:47:48.270
and that's,
and there was no one on the other end of the spectrum to say,
Hey,

1858
01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:51.060
no,
we're not doing that.
Stop.

1859
01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:55.260
And that's the biggest lesson from that situation actually from both the

1860
01:47:55.261 --> 01:47:58.260
situations and you know,
you know,

1861
01:47:58.261 --> 01:48:01.710
people talk about is how can the leader be responsible if they're not there?

1862
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:04.980
You know?
Yes.
The leader's responsible,

1863
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:07.500
whether they're the way they train the people,
the way they educated,

1864
01:48:07.501 --> 01:48:10.350
the way they communicated,
the culture that they sat with those people,

1865
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.191
they're responsible.

1866
01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:14.400
And certainly these leaders were absolutely responsible in these scenarios.

1867
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:18.660
<v 2>I guess before we wrap up,
one last thing I want to ask you is these days,
um,</v>

1868
01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:21.900
you say you work a lot with businesses.
You clearly are,
you know,

1869
01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:26.190
you're working primarily on the concept of leadership and out to teach people a

1870
01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:30.560
better tools to handle it.
How do you go about it?
What's your,

1871
01:48:30.561 --> 01:48:31.330
what are you,

1872
01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:35.750
is it primarily like a business oriented approach now with major businesses that

1873
01:48:35.751 --> 01:48:36.584
are,

1874
01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:36.891
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1875
01:48:36.891 --> 01:48:41.510
We'll go in and do an assessment and figure out where the friction points are.

1876
01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:45.440
Figure out where they're having problems and,

1877
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:47.780
and then we solve the problems that they're having through leadership.

1878
01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:52.940
And that's every single problem in every single organization is a leadership

1879
01:48:54.111 --> 01:48:58.610
problem.
All of them,
whether it's your P and L's upside down,

1880
01:48:58.611 --> 01:49:00.710
whether it's your processes are working correctly,

1881
01:49:00.711 --> 01:49:02.570
whether you got the wrong people in the wrong positions,

1882
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:07.820
it doesn't matter what the problems are going to get solved through leadership

1883
01:49:07.821 --> 01:49:10.070
and leadership alone.
And that's why we,

1884
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:14.450
that's why we're doing well because if you've got,
if you've got a p and l,

1885
01:49:14.451 --> 01:49:15.051
it's upside down.

1886
01:49:15.051 --> 01:49:18.260
You've got leaders that aren't paying attention to their expenditures and and

1887
01:49:18.261 --> 01:49:21.530
their income,
right?
If you've got processes that aren't working,

1888
01:49:21.531 --> 01:49:24.650
you've got leaders that are in charge of those processes that are allowing them

1889
01:49:24.651 --> 01:49:27.320
to continue to exist without refinement.

1890
01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:31.250
If you've got people that are in positions that shouldn't be in those positions,

1891
01:49:31.251 --> 01:49:34.640
you've got leaders that are allowing them to be in those positions without

1892
01:49:34.641 --> 01:49:38.390
either being coached and mentored and trained so that they can lead or removed

1893
01:49:38.391 --> 01:49:42.380
from those positions and you can go right down the list with any problem that

1894
01:49:42.381 --> 01:49:43.670
any organization is having.

1895
01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:48.040
There's a leadership solution to that problem and that's what we

1896
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:48.580
<v 1>do.</v>

1897
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:52.720
It seems to me like as definitely the thing I'm going to take away from the most

1898
01:49:52.721 --> 01:49:55.840
and listen you talk about this stuff is one of the things that struck me is I

1899
01:49:55.841 --> 01:49:57.970
came in with a lot of questions in mind.

1900
01:49:57.971 --> 01:50:01.020
I wanted to talk to you about like that I started out with,
right you,

1901
01:50:01.021 --> 01:50:01.870
you've got your guys,

1902
01:50:01.871 --> 01:50:05.020
you're going into a horrible situation and there's these horrible things going

1903
01:50:05.021 --> 01:50:05.111
on.

1904
01:50:05.111 --> 01:50:09.790
How do you restrain your guys from going and retaliating in these terrible ways

1905
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:12.640
and your response and the look on your face and everything to it?

1906
01:50:12.670 --> 01:50:15.260
It actually like kind of threw me off a little bit.
It wasn't what I,

1907
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:19.450
what I was expecting because your,
your answer to that really was,
dude,

1908
01:50:19.451 --> 01:50:23.680
if I have gotten to the point where we're there in Iraq and there was a guy with

1909
01:50:23.690 --> 01:50:27.250
handcuffs and I have to figure out how to restrain my guys from doing something

1910
01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:32.410
I failed a long time ago.
You cause you took it as almost like,
ah,
well you know,

1911
01:50:32.411 --> 01:50:35.320
you deal with it.
That was taken care of.
We,
how do we stop them?

1912
01:50:35.530 --> 01:50:38.590
We stopped him in training,
we stopped doing bootcamp,
we stopped to make buds,

1913
01:50:38.591 --> 01:50:40.540
we stuffed them in turn all the way up to here.

1914
01:50:40.670 --> 01:50:43.640
<v 0>And I don't want to make that,
I don't want to,
I don't want to make that,</v>

1915
01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:48.110
I don't want to make light of that cause that,
that is a hard situation.

1916
01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:53.500
And when you lose guys in a unit of 35 guys and you got guys that are wounded

1917
01:50:54.231 --> 01:50:57.980
and killed,
there is absolutely,
uh,

1918
01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:04.660
there is an absolute fire that you have to control because we know who's doing

1919
01:51:09.471 --> 01:51:13.340
it.
We can find them.
We can get out there and get and get after them.

1920
01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:17.720
And so we,
we do have to keep ourselves in check.
We do,
I mean,

1921
01:51:17.721 --> 01:51:22.430
we had many conversations of,
hey,
remember why we're here.

1922
01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:27.170
Remember who we represent.
Remember that if we get out of line,

1923
01:51:27.410 --> 01:51:30.200
we won't even be allowed to do what we do anymore.
Oh,
so,

1924
01:51:30.201 --> 01:51:35.090
so don't take it the wrong way.
That in any unit,
any unit,

1925
01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:39.320
you lose people,
you lose your friends,
you lose your brothers.

1926
01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:41.540
That is an emotional,

1927
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:47.690
it's an emotional thing and you're in an emotional situation already and you

1928
01:51:47.691 --> 01:51:48.980
have access,

1929
01:51:49.010 --> 01:51:54.010
direct access to unleash your emotions if you're allowed to.

1930
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:59.440
And Yeah,
the,
you know,

1931
01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:03.200
with the platoon commanders that worked for me with,
I mean those guys,
you know,

1932
01:52:03.201 --> 01:52:06.580
lay,
who wrote the book with me.
I mean he absolutely had to,

1933
01:52:06.710 --> 01:52:11.480
had to sit his guys down and explain to them,
hey,
let's remember why we're here.

1934
01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:16.840
Let's remember that we could go to jail if we do the wrong thing.

1935
01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:21.020
And nothing that we do here is worth any of you going to jail for any amount of

1936
01:52:21.021 --> 01:52:25.280
time.
So I didn't mean to make light of how hard that is.

1937
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:30.530
And,
and how difficult that can be.
And,
and it's not just for me,

1938
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:33.470
not just for the seals,
but you know,

1939
01:52:33.471 --> 01:52:36.290
the marines just soldiers that were there who are dealing with,
like I said,

1940
01:52:36.291 --> 01:52:37.460
they're doing with younger kids and,

1941
01:52:37.730 --> 01:52:42.080
and less with less training and you know,
those,

1942
01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:43.220
but when you come in the seal teams,

1943
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:44.870
you came in because he wanted to go to combat.

1944
01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:49.550
Like every single CEO wants to go to combat.
They want to be there.

1945
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:52.640
I don't know if you've ever heard my retirement speech.
It's,
it's,

1946
01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:57.440
it's on youtube.
But when like I made a list and said,
hey,

1947
01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:02.060
if you want to go over to the eastern part of Ramadi and live in,
uh,
in,
uh,

1948
01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:06.890
blown out bunker and get into firefights every day,
put your name on this list.

1949
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:07.850
And I walked out of the room,

1950
01:53:07.851 --> 01:53:10.340
I came back 20 minutes later and every single guy in the task,

1951
01:53:10.341 --> 01:53:12.320
and it had their name on the list.
So we're,

1952
01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:15.320
we're dealing with guys at every single guy.
That's what they want to do.
Now.

1953
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:19.130
Do they get tired?
Do they get combat stress?
They absolutely do.

1954
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:22.220
Do they get scared?
Yes they do.
It's,
it's hard.

1955
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:27.320
But we have a guy that at least start from the position of I want to do this.

1956
01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.750
This is my profession.
The army,
you know,
you,

1957
01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:32.750
you definitely end up with guys that are coming in the army because they wanted

1958
01:53:32.751 --> 01:53:35.730
to pay for college or they wanted to get a job or they wanted to get out or

1959
01:53:35.731 --> 01:53:39.170
whatever hometown there in and,
and that's how they ended up in the army.
Again,

1960
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:43.220
there's also a great number of soldiers that are just as eager for combat and

1961
01:53:43.221 --> 01:53:47.300
certainly great number of marines that are the same attitude.
So each,

1962
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:49.550
each one of those people,
you have your own challenges and it,

1963
01:53:49.551 --> 01:53:51.890
and it is hard and you do have to,

1964
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:56.510
and what goes back to what this whole thing has been about as the leader,

1965
01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:00.170
you can't be the one that's getting wrapped up in those emotions.

1966
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:03.020
You can't be the one when you,
yeah,
I'll tell you what,

1967
01:54:03.021 --> 01:54:06.950
your heart's going to be fucking broken.
When you lose guys,

1968
01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:11.510
it's going to be broken and you're going to want nothing more than to go out and

1969
01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:14.930
rubble cds and salt the earth.

1970
01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:18.860
So everyone is dead and no one will ever live there again.

1971
01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:24.010
But if you let that get ahold of you as the leader,

1972
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:25.680
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1973
01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:26.550
<v 0>Your,
your,</v>

1974
01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.750
your team and your men are going to be in hell.

1975
01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:31.980
That's where they're gonna end up.

1976
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:36.990
And so that's why the education,
the training,

1977
01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.360
the understanding of it,
it's so many people contacted me after I did the,
the,

1978
01:54:40.361 --> 01:54:41.550
the me lie podcast.

1979
01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:46.880
That isn't your thank you that they play that [inaudible] podcast for leadership

1980
01:54:47.011 --> 01:54:51.030
training inside multiple military organizations.
It's,
it's awesome.

1981
01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:54.420
I'm so happy that they do that because when I came out with that podcast,

1982
01:54:54.421 --> 01:54:56.970
I had tons of people that said I didn't,
it didn't know about that.

1983
01:54:57.270 --> 01:55:00.440
People that were in leadership positions didn't understand,

1984
01:55:00.441 --> 01:55:03.780
didn't know what the meal I'm asking her was.
And it's,
uh,

1985
01:55:04.290 --> 01:55:07.920
it's one of the darkest stains on our history.

1986
01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:12.060
But you have to talk about it and you talked earlier about,
hey,

1987
01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:12.930
I don't want to make it.

1988
01:55:12.930 --> 01:55:15.690
I didn't really want to go into too much of what led up to it cause I didn't

1989
01:55:15.691 --> 01:55:17.520
want to make excuses,
man.

1990
01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:21.480
I went into detail of why it happened because I want everyone to understand all

1991
01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:24.090
those little things.
How when you cut those corners,

1992
01:55:24.091 --> 01:55:28.590
how when you play the telephone game with your intelligence and you let people

1993
01:55:28.591 --> 01:55:31.320
say things that you don't put them in check and you don't,

1994
01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:34.800
you let them use words that are correct and you've people that don't have a

1995
01:55:34.801 --> 01:55:36.510
culture to ask why we're doing this.

1996
01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:41.750
And you set those situations up and you let bad leaders into situate or in

1997
01:55:41.941 --> 01:55:45.930
positions that they shouldn't be Cali failing out of ocs multiple times.

1998
01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:48.000
Like that's it.
That's it.

1999
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:53.030
You let those things happen and you're going to end up in hell and as a leader,

2000
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:55.890
that's your job to stop it.
Yeah.

2001
01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:59.770
<v 1>That's a good place to wrap it up,
man.
Me Lie.
You lie.</v>

2002
01:55:59.771 --> 01:56:02.080
It didn't necessarily happen on March,

2003
01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:06.010
1619 68 it happened when Cali failed.
It was ocs.

2004
01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:09.340
It happened when the intelligence failed to get passed down properly.

2005
01:56:09.341 --> 01:56:13.420
It failed every time somebody was allowed to smack around a Vietnamese and they

2006
01:56:13.421 --> 01:56:16.780
didn't get called on it.
That's when it happened.
You know,
the,
the,
the,
the,

2007
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:21.400
the actual acute incident was just the result of a long,
long process.
So.

2008
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:24.520
Awesome.
It's great man.
Thank you so much.

2009
01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:25.301
<v 0>Thanks for having me on.</v>

2010
01:56:25.301 --> 01:56:30.301
Thanks for you guys for what you do and you guys put out kick ass podcasts and I

2011
01:56:30.431 --> 01:56:34.840
appreciate listening to them and maybe we'll get to do this again

2012
01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:38.270
<v 1>in South Dakota as well.
I mean,
I can tell you from my own personal,
uh,</v>

2013
01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:42.920
experience,
listen to your podcasts as well as a lot of guys I know of all ages,

2014
01:56:42.921 --> 01:56:46.270
guys from high school all the way on up into their 50s or one guy that I know is

2015
01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:50.360
a huge fan.
Um,
you know,
I don't want to just,
uh,

2016
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:52.610
three of us and it's getting a little sweaty in here already,

2017
01:56:52.611 --> 01:56:55.460
so I won't get on my knees too much.
But,
uh,
it's not an,

2018
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:57.770
it's not an exaggeration to say that you're changing people's lives,

2019
01:56:57.771 --> 01:56:59.120
so thank you and keep it up.
I mean,

2020
01:56:59.490 --> 01:57:02.840
we've got to have a great effect on me personally,
so thank you.
Thanks Barb.

2021
01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:04.040
Thanks for listening.
Thanks guys.

2022
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:10.820
<v 0>And that wraps up the conversation and thanks for listening and thanks to Daryl</v>

2023
01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:16.060
Cooper and Danieli Bilali for organizing that discussion.

2024
01:57:16.061 --> 01:57:19.800
And I look forward to having some more of those types of conversations in the

2025
01:57:19.801 --> 01:57:24.801
future about history and about human nature and about leadership.

2026
01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:32.980
And in the meantime,
Echo,
yes,
it was.

2027
01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.100
Speaking of leadership,

2028
01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:39.840
if people want to lead themselves down the right path,

2029
01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:45.030
the path,
yes.
Do you have any maybe recommendations for them?

2030
01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:49.890
Sure,
of course they do.
So we're all working out,

2031
01:57:51.250 --> 01:57:55.750
right?
Every day.
Yeah.
You work out every day.

2032
01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:00.300
Although I got sick.
You just straight up at arrests.
Yeah.
Flu,

2033
01:58:01.050 --> 01:58:05.640
flu.
Yeah.
You know what that is?
Yeah,
man,
I hear bad things.

2034
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:09.680
No,
it wasn't.
The shot did.
I didn't get that.
You know,

2035
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:13.080
I hear mixed reviews about the whole flute deal.
Either way,

2036
01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:15.700
you're obviously better.
You seem better and better,

2037
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:20.220
which is good because now you can get back to working out and when you get back

2038
01:58:20.221 --> 01:58:23.190
to working out,
you still want to maintain your joints sick or not sick,

2039
01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.290
maintain your joints.
That's what I think.

2040
01:58:26.130 --> 01:58:28.530
I think everyone would agree with me on that one,

2041
01:58:28.531 --> 01:58:32.010
and the way you maintain your joints is to take joint supplements like Krill
oil,

2042
01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:36.240
Jocko,
super krill oil.
That's the good one.
Talk with supplements.
That's right.

2043
01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:41.040
Also a good supplement called joint warfare.
I take those every single day,

2044
01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:42.250
every single day.

2045
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:46.420
<v 4>No pressure,
no slack,
no slack unless you run out,
but he was a thing.</v>

2046
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:48.670
You don't have to run out anymore.
You subscribe,

2047
01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:53.530
you get the subscription situation.
Every what,
30 days,
60 days,

2048
01:58:53.531 --> 01:58:56.830
whatever,
however much you use or whatever.
You got an estimate and then boom,

2049
01:58:56.831 --> 01:59:00.610
you do your subscription.
You get one in the mail every month.
Never run out.

2050
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.020
Maintain the joints.
Important.

2051
01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:08.250
More important than your power mass gainer 5,000 I think so too.

2052
01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:16.720
Yeah.
Also,
you want some cognitive enhancements,
which you do.

2053
01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.200
You do.
You totally do.
Brothers like you know,

2054
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:24.220
cell phone signals and you know,
pollutions,

2055
01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:28.210
pollutants from cars.
That's a mess up your brain.

2056
01:59:28.211 --> 01:59:30.100
Sometimes you need some cognitive enhancement.

2057
01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:35.560
Jock was another supplement called discipline.
It's a pre mission,

2058
01:59:35.590 --> 01:59:40.450
cognitive hands,
physical enhancement,
cognitive enhancement,
all in one boom.

2059
01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:44.170
And it tastes good.
Boom.
Take it.
I would say take that everyday.

2060
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:47.550
You take it before stuff,
so you call it a pre mission indicates you take it

2061
01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:51.120
<v 0>before you do something where you get me before I do a mission,</v>

2062
01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:56.280
that mission could be going to work with a company like,
Hey,

2063
01:59:56.281 --> 02:00:00.540
I'm going to need to be on my a game mentally because we're solving problems for

2064
02:00:00.541 --> 02:00:03.480
digging into the leadership situations.
We're finding out what's going on.

2065
02:00:04.050 --> 02:00:07.650
Any game has got a calm also Jujitsu.
Yeah.

2066
02:00:07.710 --> 02:00:09.210
But that people always say,

2067
02:00:09.211 --> 02:00:13.260
well I thought you didn't take preop workouts and I don't.
Not for a workout.

2068
02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:18.690
Oh yeah.
For the workouts.
I mean I might do that one out of every 10 workouts.

2069
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:22.830
Maybe even when I was 21 I take some kind of a pre pre workout.

2070
02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:25.670
<v 4>Yeah.
It's</v>

2071
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:29.460
<v 0>cause when I wake up in the morning I'm not hungry.
Yeah.
Not even third.</v>

2072
02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:31.720
I mean I drink water,
but I'm not like that.

2073
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:36.790
I don't feel the need for some jack me up during the workout and I'm just going

2074
02:00:37.321 --> 02:00:38.520
to go get it.
Yeah.

2075
02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:41.730
And you don't really drink coffee so you don't even have that situation.

2076
02:00:41.731 --> 02:00:44.760
You know?
I don't like coffee and people will ask why I don't like coffee.

2077
02:00:44.761 --> 02:00:47.520
Don't like the taste of it tastes horrible.
Yeah.
So what that did,

2078
02:00:47.521 --> 02:00:49.740
is it like it made you,

2079
02:00:49.741 --> 02:00:52.620
or it didn't allow you to get into the coffee system?

2080
02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.910
Because that's really what it is.
I mean,
I hate to call it,

2081
02:00:54.911 --> 02:00:56.880
everyone says it's an acquired taste.

2082
02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:59.130
My question is when something is an acquired taste,

2083
02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:02.190
how many times do you have to drink something that's socks before you're like,

2084
02:01:02.191 --> 02:01:06.710
okay,
I like the smell.
You acquire that.
Uh,
yeah man.
And,

2085
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:10.170
and there wasn't for me,
there was no,
it wasn't like,
Hey,
if I can get this,

2086
02:01:10.171 --> 02:01:14.820
if I can start liking this,
I'll be,
I'll be stronger.
No,
I wasn't going to happen.

2087
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:16.021
It was like,
Hey,

2088
02:01:16.021 --> 02:01:19.740
if I started liking us and I'll spend $4 a day at a coffee store,
no,

2089
02:01:19.741 --> 02:01:22.260
not happening.
Well usually,
I mean like beer,
right?

2090
02:01:22.290 --> 02:01:26.820
When you first drink beer typically tastes,
I don't know.

2091
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:30.210
I'm not good with any acquired taste.
No,
not chocolate milk.
Chocolate milk.

2092
02:01:30.211 --> 02:01:34.060
Right off the bat everyone acquired,
right.
Immediately acquired.
Yeah.

2093
02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:37.980
That's not an acquired taste.

2094
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:43.130
<v 4>Yeah.
And that's probably why you make things taste good because you don't,</v>

2095
02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.510
you're not down for the whole acquired situation or taste well.
Okay.

2096
02:01:47.511 --> 02:01:51.890
So like beer,
coffee is the same deal because there's a,

2097
02:01:51.891 --> 02:01:56.030
there's a benefit beyond just the taste.
So beer is like,
yeah,

2098
02:01:56.031 --> 02:01:59.560
you get drunk or whatever and people like that,
but it's like Dang the beers.

2099
02:01:59.590 --> 02:02:02.000
Kind of this barrier.
Like I wish it tasted better,
blah blah blah.

2100
02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:05.660
That's why they do Jello shots,
you know,
she's getting there anyway.

2101
02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:07.760
So after a while you're like,

2102
02:02:07.761 --> 02:02:12.560
you know what all endure the taste to get venture.
You like the taste.

2103
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:15.350
You ended up liking the taste because you can kind of recognize certain,

2104
02:02:15.351 --> 02:02:17.900
you know,
there's all kinds of things.
Same thing with coffee.

2105
02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:22.700
You kind of start to like the taste because the originally initially you want to

2106
02:02:22.701 --> 02:02:25.040
get the boost,
the caffeine boost.

2107
02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:30.200
Well the good thing is with with the products that we make,
there's no,

2108
02:02:30.230 --> 02:02:33.080
they're not acquired taste this taste good direct.

2109
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:38.350
A delicious can just get a taste for it from the get go and just this discipline

2110
02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:41.900
pre mission is no exception.
Tastes good.
It's like a lemon lime.

2111
02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:45.350
Is that the official flavor official lemon lime official.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2112
02:02:45.351 --> 02:02:47.780
That's a good one because that's like a real like broad,

2113
02:02:47.781 --> 02:02:49.570
like most people going to like the lemon lime.
Yeah,

2114
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:51.760
like it takes a Weirdo to not like lemon law.

2115
02:02:51.761 --> 02:02:55.490
You've got to or if not that that's a bad thing you're probably missed,

2116
02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:58.700
but nonetheless it does taste good.

2117
02:02:58.701 --> 02:03:03.701
I will agree with that and I think it's one of those deals where you can just

2118
02:03:04.011 --> 02:03:08.360
take it even if it's not right before some stuff I just drink it.

2119
02:03:08.361 --> 02:03:13.280
Sometimes I'm just straight up wants something sweet,
just trade out.

2120
02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:16.550
It's all good for your brain and stuff.
Is that a lack of discipline?

2121
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:22.310
I want something sweet.
No,
because unless it's like a bad thing.
No,

2122
02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:24.620
I don't know when cause you think about you want to break it down.

2123
02:03:24.621 --> 02:03:28.670
What makes something a lack of discipline?
It's like when you slip,

2124
02:03:28.671 --> 02:03:31.850
when it's like goes beyond your intentions,
right?
If you intend to do something,

2125
02:03:31.851 --> 02:03:32.481
but then it's like,

2126
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:35.780
oh my immediate payoff is going to kind of get in the way or whatever,

2127
02:03:35.781 --> 02:03:37.010
then that's why it's okay to be like,

2128
02:03:37.011 --> 02:03:40.520
tomorrow I'm going to have a mint chocolate chip milkshake.
Yeah.
It kinda is.

2129
02:03:40.521 --> 02:03:42.470
Not Today,
tomorrow,

2130
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:46.850
but if that deviated from your original whole plan,
then it's lack of discipline.

2131
02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.650
Like if you're like,
oh,
I'm really craving a shake.

2132
02:03:48.651 --> 02:03:50.120
I won't have it today but I'll have it tomorrow.

2133
02:03:50.150 --> 02:03:52.850
Even though the plan is doesn't entail you having it tomorrow,
man.

2134
02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:56.740
It's like a lack of discipline just on a bigger scale I guess.
Or more belong.

2135
02:03:56.750 --> 02:04:01.130
Longevity,
skill check.
Nonetheless.
Discipline.
It's good.

2136
02:04:01.131 --> 02:04:03.140
It tastes good.
It feels good.

2137
02:04:03.170 --> 02:04:06.800
It won't take discipline to take discipline is what I'm saying.

2138
02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:09.890
Like cause it's going to taste good.
It's gonna make your,
your swing.

2139
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:14.360
You know what it is when you take it.
I was talking to jade about this.

2140
02:04:14.361 --> 02:04:17.420
It's like a,
um,
you know how like when you're searching for a word,
you know,

2141
02:04:17.421 --> 02:04:19.850
when you're trying to explain something and like let's say out of know your

2142
02:04:19.851 --> 02:04:24.230
brain is off,
you're hung over four year,
didn't get enough sleep or whatever,

2143
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:27.350
and you're searching wall,
what's that word again?
Or you forget someone's name,

2144
02:04:27.351 --> 02:04:28.910
like your friend or something like this.

2145
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:34.220
It's almost like the discipline is going to connect those dots for you.
Yeah.

2146
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:35.950
And this is what it feels like,
you know,
feel like,

2147
02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.750
you know what you ever played the like power ball or something not right.

2148
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:42.970
And will you ever seen like on the news how they get the balls?
Yeah.

2149
02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:46.230
It's like this big around cage that they spent and all the,

2150
02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.660
all the balls fly around in there and then they just kind of,

2151
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:52.110
one randomly comes into the little shoot there.
It's what it feels like.

2152
02:04:52.230 --> 02:04:53.790
It's like that's all the words.

2153
02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:59.040
It's your brain and that's all the words and man that correct words just not

2154
02:04:59.041 --> 02:05:00.870
shoot,
he's not coming in there.
You know what I mean?

2155
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:04.860
But the discipline shoots the right words in there like no,
like one speed,
boom,

2156
02:05:04.861 --> 02:05:07.320
boom,
boom,
boom.
See what I'm saying?
That's what it feels like.

2157
02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:11.390
Take this one when the lottery to check.
Yup.

2158
02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:13.380
Same exact thing nonetheless as good.

2159
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:18.381
Get that@originmain.com that's where you can get all this stuff or didn't.

2160
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:22.380
Labs are producing it by the truckload for for us.

2161
02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:23.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2162
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:28.100
<v 4>Also an origin main.com there's some good keys on there.</v>

2163
02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:33.370
Really good geese only gives them wearing them forever.
Forever straight up,

2164
02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:35.740
and they're made in America.
By the way,

2165
02:05:36.670 --> 02:05:39.430
the cottons made in America sewn in America.

2166
02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:44.170
Lu Lune is not a verb woven with looms.

2167
02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:46.850
Wrong word lottery.
Just pop

2168
02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:55.660
moved into a verb.
Maybe that's proactive.
You know I'm creating work.
It's true.

2169
02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:58.290
See,
hey,
what?
Shakespeare made up a word.
Everyone was cool with it,
right?

2170
02:05:58.460 --> 02:06:00.520
All of a sudden that came cool,
and you can make words.

2171
02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:02.290
All you need is people to sign up.

2172
02:06:02.291 --> 02:06:07.291
So you know why the cotton is straight up loomed in America and sold them,

2173
02:06:08.050 --> 02:06:11.500
assembled in them.
They're made in America,
straight up the geese.

2174
02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:15.400
This rash guards on their compression gear,
if you will,
pants and tops.

2175
02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:21.270
By the way,
it's not just cotton,
you know?
That's why it's so different.
Yeah.

2176
02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:26.420
Because it's,
it's,
it's a hybrid blend.
It's not just cotton.
All right.

2177
02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:31.000
So yeah,
there's that,
that's why the material dries quicker.

2178
02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:34.810
That's why it's antimicrobrial type doesn't smell bad.

2179
02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:37.950
That's why we're dries out quick.
That's why it's lighter because it's,

2180
02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:42.910
it's made from the Getgo for Jujitsu.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,

2181
02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:44.230
and that is a big deal.
If you,

2182
02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:47.230
if you take Jujitsu and you even just pay even that much attention to that kind

2183
02:06:47.231 --> 02:06:50.110
of stuff,
it makes a difference.
And then tried to go back to your old g,

2184
02:06:50.111 --> 02:06:54.520
you can be like print.
Why don't even do that to my origins sticking with it.

2185
02:06:54.521 --> 02:06:58.190
That's why I'm sticking with it.
So speaking to you,
get through,

2186
02:06:58.210 --> 02:07:00.790
there's an immersion camp coming up,

2187
02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:06.820
slept or August 26th through September 2nd this to two sessions.

2188
02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:11.830
Right.
Early late session.
I'm going jockey you going?

2189
02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:14.410
I am going both sessions.

2190
02:07:14.411 --> 02:07:18.850
Port Jocko was so mad he couldn't participate last time.
Yeah,

2191
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:25.250
it was almost like something was there just bothering you the whole time?
Oh No,

2192
02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:29.310
no.
A lot.
Yeah.
Well he didn't show it that much,
but you could tell.

2193
02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:33.930
Well yeah,
I wouldn't say I let it get to me,
but it definitely bothered me.

2194
02:07:33.970 --> 02:07:34.990
It would show every,

2195
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:38.950
every once in awhile unless Jack will be there in full effect this time.

2196
02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:43.860
And uh,
yeah,
I'll be there and uh,
you know,

2197
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:47.650
we can immerse ourselves in Jujitsu.
That's what it is.

2198
02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:52.660
It's not a bootcamp.
August 26 through September 2nd.
Yeah.
That's a good one.

2199
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:53.770
Coming to origin.
Yeah.

2200
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:58.030
So go to origin main.com you can look at literally all of these immersion

2201
02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:01.360
immersion camp.
You can only do Jujitsu.
How many days,

2202
02:08:01.450 --> 02:08:04.480
how many hours a day can you do Jujitsu?
What in real life or in the camp?

2203
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:06.550
In the camp and in real life.

2204
02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:11.620
I guess technically in the camp you can do it for 24 hours.

2205
02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:15.130
Really technically,
if you really want,
you know,
realistically,

2206
02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:18.280
what do you think someone does two or three hours in the morning and two or

2207
02:08:18.281 --> 02:08:20.830
three hours in the afternoon or mid two hours in the morning,

2208
02:08:20.831 --> 02:08:23.460
two hours in the afternoon,
two hours in the evening,
six hours a day.
Yeah,

2209
02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:28.150
you'll be sore.
You're going getting after it,
which you're not obligated to do.

2210
02:08:28.151 --> 02:08:32.230
But that's the freedom you have.
And that's how good it is.
And that's the thing,

2211
02:08:32.231 --> 02:08:36.280
man.
So you know how like let's say you for example,
yeah.
And you're like,
Hey,

2212
02:08:36.281 --> 02:08:38.910
I want to,
on a rule,
two hours in the morning,
two hours afternoon,

2213
02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:42.550
two hours at night.
I know.
But here's the thing.
You can't just decide to roll.

2214
02:08:42.551 --> 02:08:45.250
You got to roll with somebody.
Otherwise he just only by yourself.

2215
02:08:45.550 --> 02:08:49.930
So that's a problem in the real world,
not everyone you know,
but this camp,

2216
02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:54.790
oh yeah.
Every single time.
Pining people,
by the way,
all levels.
Boom.

2217
02:08:54.910 --> 02:08:57.760
So yeah,
get some,
even if you've never done Jujitsu,

2218
02:08:57.970 --> 02:09:02.040
ever still go and learn some shit to get off to it.

2219
02:09:02.230 --> 02:09:06.480
It's a good way to look.
The ground running.
Immersion.
Burgers.
Yarn.
Yup.

2220
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:09.190
Fully or domain.com check.

2221
02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:13.040
Look at all this stuff and you know Dave Burke's coming by the way.
Yeah.

2222
02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:15.700
I'm looking forward to them.
Lister Immersion Jujitsu.

2223
02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:18.790
Interim Dave Burke calls me.
I see his name pop on my phone.
Like you know,

2224
02:09:18.791 --> 02:09:21.250
every once in a while you'll run into that guy who can give you that feeling

2225
02:09:21.251 --> 02:09:23.980
like,
oh gosh,
Dave Brooks calling me.
Yeah,
good deal.

2226
02:09:23.981 --> 02:09:26.160
Did it kind of like brightens your day?
Little new.

2227
02:09:26.170 --> 02:09:28.540
I don't know what else is coming.
I don't know if JP is going to come or life.

2228
02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:33.700
Yeah,
I gotta check the schedules.
Yeah.
Got To block the F team schedules.
Yeah,

2229
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:36.430
that'd be good if both of them come.
They've been,

2230
02:09:36.431 --> 02:09:39.900
I've been noticing they've been getting their train on or trying to train.
Yeah,

2231
02:09:39.901 --> 02:09:44.230
man.
That's good.
Also,
speaking of the training,

2232
02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:49.000
if you want some good fitness gear,
mix up the workout,

2233
02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:52.780
get more creative with the workout with the movements and equipment.

2234
02:09:52.781 --> 02:09:57.670
Could have [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko get yourself some primal bells.

2235
02:09:57.730 --> 02:09:59.620
I highly recommend.
By the way,

2236
02:09:59.621 --> 02:10:02.710
someone hit me up because we had this conversation last time.

2237
02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:05.350
You said that my workouts were boring.
Yeah.

2238
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:10.630
And someone kind of sided with me just so you know.
Cool.

2239
02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:15.760
Cause I said the workouts can be boring if you're boring.
Right.

2240
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:21.100
But the thing is we did people sided with me.
Well they're right and,

2241
02:10:21.130 --> 02:10:25.900
and straight up.
You're right.
Because I think we kind of concluded that to where,

2242
02:10:26.650 --> 02:10:30.220
yeah,
you know,
if you're boring or if you intentionally make it boring,

2243
02:10:30.221 --> 02:10:32.620
it's boring.
That's how,
in fact,
the board,

2244
02:10:32.890 --> 02:10:36.890
the boredom and the boringness of the workout can be part of a certain type of

2245
02:10:36.891 --> 02:10:39.030
training.
You know,
it's like a mental endurance training.

2246
02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.030
So it's a whole big thing.
And I was irresponsible to accuse you ever do,

2247
02:10:44.050 --> 02:10:48.710
do you ever do a workout where you just do one movement the whole the whole

2248
02:10:48.711 --> 02:10:53.450
time?
No.
Wait,
there is some mental,
not a fool.
There's some sort of like,

2249
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:55.900
there's definitely something to that mentally.
Yeah.

2250
02:10:56.030 --> 02:11:00.610
You know like oh I'm just going to do 500 repetitions of whatever this is.

2251
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:05.450
Actually yes I have.
It was snatch.
So get a little snack.
Here's the thing though.

2252
02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:08.980
It was I cared about Scotch.
No.
Oh,
barbell.
Barbell.
Yeah.
Okay.

2253
02:11:09.170 --> 02:11:13.460
It was a cross fit 500 snatches it.
That's no,

2254
02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:19.280
that's no joke.
I forget how many,
it was a dumb amount.
Put it that way.
Well,

2255
02:11:19.281 --> 02:11:21.960
at the time I thought it was anyway.
I forget how much it was probably,

2256
02:11:25.170 --> 02:11:28.700
I mean it's already done.
I think it was 200 board at 50.

2257
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:34.640
You power through those last five reps though.
I'm the sucker then.

2258
02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:40.250
Hey,
I did it,
but that was it.
That's the only thing.
Super Sore the next day.

2259
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:44.900
Yeah,
but that's it.
Yeah.
Snatch.
Let's not just kind of a fun exercise though.

2260
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:48.120
That's the thing.
Yeah.
Well,
well yeah,

2261
02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:52.910
but the movement is like,
it's more dynamic than just,
um,
you know,

2262
02:11:52.911 --> 02:11:55.790
like the thing with exercises like the snatch,

2263
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:59.630
if you're not focused on,
this one's real simple,

2264
02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:02.400
but if you don't focus box jump.
Oh,
you,

2265
02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:04.940
if you let your mind wander during a boss' job,
next thing you know,

2266
02:12:04.941 --> 02:12:09.640
you've got f eight inch savage scar on your shit.
Yeah.

2267
02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:10.910
Yeah.
Very true.

2268
02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:15.500
You ever near miss a box jump and it wakes you up and you're like,
oh man,

2269
02:12:15.501 --> 02:12:17.920
I wasn't paying attention.
Paid the man on that one.

2270
02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:21.290
I don't do that much box jumps probably.
I used to,

2271
02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.440
I used to box jump like a savage check all your own.

2272
02:12:28.101 --> 02:12:31.050
Perfect.
Super stoked that I know that now.

2273
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:33.110
Nonetheless,

2274
02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:38.630
there's some cool workout equipment.
Gear on.

2275
02:12:38.631 --> 02:12:43.130
They're boring workout or not get creative.
Boom,

2276
02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:46.280
look in there.
A lot of stuff.
I was just on their night yesterday,
the day before.

2277
02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:52.070
Good.
Good,
good website.
Good Info too by the way on it.com/jocko.
Good spot.

2278
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:55.970
Good way to support.
Also when you get these books,

2279
02:12:56.150 --> 02:13:01.010
I think I'm re designing the website.
Good.
I think so.
I think it's old,

2280
02:13:01.450 --> 02:13:05.320
old looking now those rat,
it was the anticipated list.

2281
02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:08.300
Why are you trying to get around to it?

2282
02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:13.120
Rather website was old looking since day one,
but nonetheless.
Um,

2283
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:16.060
anyway,
back to the point.
Uh,

2284
02:13:16.070 --> 02:13:21.020
when you get any of the books that we review,

2285
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:25.880
including Jockos actual books way the word kit,

2286
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:29.960
extreme ownership,
the field manual,
all these books.
Look,

2287
02:13:29.961 --> 02:13:34.961
I'm going to list it on the and the books are listed by episode in the book

2288
02:13:35.821 --> 02:13:38.760
section.
You just click through there when you get them.
Boom.

2289
02:13:38.761 --> 02:13:42.720
Good way to support ticks to Amazon as a prime.
One day shipping.
Boom.
Good,

2290
02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:46.230
good way to support to buy Yakim through their good way to support.

2291
02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:50.520
Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.
Seems obvious.
I know,

2292
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:54.810
but some people they haven't subscribed and they're not obligated to,

2293
02:13:54.811 --> 02:13:58.440
but if you do want to support your subscribes,
good way.
Also on Youtube,

2294
02:13:59.690 --> 02:14:02.370
I want to say subscribe and talking,
iTunes,
stitcher,
Google,
play,

2295
02:14:02.371 --> 02:14:05.520
all that stuff and youtube.
So don't exclude youtube.

2296
02:14:05.521 --> 02:14:09.840
The video version of this podcast,
which you've been pretty motivated on lately.

2297
02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:11.880
We'll say active.
Sure.
I don't,

2298
02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:15.900
I don't count on motivation or that I try to stick with the discipline.

2299
02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:20.700
I see what she did there.
Nonetheless,
I am disciplined with it,

2300
02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:25.800
but I am motivated to cause you know,
I understand the value of excerpts.

2301
02:14:25.801 --> 02:14:29.130
Now someone emailed me the other day,
Hey,
this excerpt of uh,

2302
02:14:29.490 --> 02:14:33.090
not joining the military or something about regretting that during the military.

2303
02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:36.240
This is what he did.
He had,
I think he had like a medical thing where it's like,

2304
02:14:36.241 --> 02:14:37.290
oh he couldn't pass or whatever,

2305
02:14:37.291 --> 02:14:41.280
but he still could do work for the military in other parts.
You know what I mean?

2306
02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:46.180
<v 0>Did he became like an electronics technician for the military even though he</v>

2307
02:14:46.181 --> 02:14:47.000
wasn't in the military?

2308
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.300
<v 4>Yeah.
Served.
Yeah.
See what I'm saying?
So like those little excerpts,</v>

2309
02:14:50.301 --> 02:14:51.770
king kind of offer this info,

2310
02:14:51.771 --> 02:14:55.790
whether it be advice or just spark other questions and people maybe they

2311
02:14:55.791 --> 02:14:56.390
wouldn't have got it.

2312
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:58.870
Maybe they miss that episode or maybe they just weren't interest

2313
02:15:00.150 --> 02:15:00.560
<v 0>episode.</v>

2314
02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.560
Somebody pointed out and somebody made a really funny meme that it showed you

2315
02:15:08.250 --> 02:15:09.470
didn't show,
you make an excerpt,

2316
02:15:09.471 --> 02:15:12.340
but it showed like someone discovering excerpt and like,
wow,
this is awesome.

2317
02:15:12.341 --> 02:15:16.600
And then it said,
oh no,
episode number attached to the sector.

2318
02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:21.160
So meaning,
Hey,
glad I got the extra.
Now where can I find this?

2319
02:15:21.450 --> 02:15:26.420
So in the future we may want to add the episode number.
Yeah.

2320
02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:30.910
So did you know that there was a big meme war?
No,
it was on the boards.

2321
02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:31.960
I need more,

2322
02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:37.020
I guess I can't really follow it 100% because it was all on reddit and,

2323
02:15:37.590 --> 02:15:40.950
but I read an article about,
there was like a legit me more

2324
02:15:42.610 --> 02:15:45.850
tell me more is different memes going back and forth at each other.

2325
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.020
But there was a me more and I've,
I've seen a funny,
somebody asked me one time,

2326
02:15:50.021 --> 02:15:53.900
they had a,
they had a ball cap.
You ever seen the ball caps that say,
you know,

2327
02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:56.570
Vietnam War veteran or Afghanistan,

2328
02:15:57.150 --> 02:16:01.090
Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom of war veteran or something like that.

2329
02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:05.020
Someone wrote me up or sent me a picture and said it is this,

2330
02:16:05.650 --> 02:16:08.730
is it offensive for me to wear this hat?
And the hat said,
you know,

2331
02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:10.800
survivor of me more.

2332
02:16:10.801 --> 02:16:14.350
And it looked like it looked like a legit veterans at and I kind of was like,

2333
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:16.200
no man,
as far as I'm concerned,
you're good.

2334
02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:18.280
I don't know what you've been through on the wars.

2335
02:16:21.810 --> 02:16:25.810
<v 4>I,
I don't know what the mean.
More is.
I will,
I'm going to look into it.
Me</v>

2336
02:16:25.850 --> 02:16:30.130
<v 0>More on reddit.
Yeah.
Very rarely.
It had to do with sequels.
See,
I can't</v>

2337
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.290
<v 4>say the whole,
I don't understand it well enough,</v>

2338
02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:35.950
but I understand it well enough to laugh and think.
It's funny.

2339
02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:40.570
I think it's very compelling.
Hundred percent me more those means are funny,
man.

2340
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:44.650
Real funny.
That's good.
That's a good thing.

2341
02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:50.680
Nonetheless,
excerpts.
I do put the episode on there.
By the way.

2342
02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:54.100
Here's the thing.
When you go,
when you go to a Youtube,
oh,

2343
02:16:54.101 --> 02:16:57.160
you gotta go to the read more or something.
You got to click on read more.

2344
02:16:57.310 --> 02:16:59.560
That's the thing.
So it looks like,
by the way,

2345
02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:03.700
I was reading youtube comments here the day.
Oh Dang,
that's a wacky,

2346
02:17:03.701 --> 02:17:08.320
wild adventure someone wrote,
why are we even making these comments?

2347
02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:12.840
Jocko and echo don't even read them.
Guess what?
Jocko reads them.
I read them.

2348
02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:16.060
Dang.
There you go.
Me More.
What's going on?
I had to do something.

2349
02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:21.060
Take some,
some kind of act.
It's just read the comments.

2350
02:17:21.250 --> 02:17:24.310
Actually that makes sense.
Because here's the thing about youtube comments.

2351
02:17:24.311 --> 02:17:27.500
This is,
this isn't new by the way.
So a lot of people know this rate.

2352
02:17:27.501 --> 02:17:30.490
We're youtube comments seem to be maybe this probably other forms.

2353
02:17:30.491 --> 02:17:31.480
And stuff where they get worse.

2354
02:17:31.481 --> 02:17:36.481
But Youtube has the most potential for terrible comments and for no reason to,

2355
02:17:36.701 --> 02:17:39.380
so this isn't it because it's completely unregulated.

2356
02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:44.470
Well you know the words on a Facebook comment or on a Twitter comment.

2357
02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:49.180
Generally it's your purse.
You're,
you're a human being.
Yeah.
Onto,
on Youtube.

2358
02:17:49.181 --> 02:17:50.440
You're just,
you're just,
yeah,

2359
02:17:50.441 --> 02:17:54.940
you can create an account and they can't really think.
Yeah.
So it's anonymous,

2360
02:17:54.980 --> 02:17:59.710
you know,
close to anonymous.
So the,
the,
the key is,

2361
02:17:59.711 --> 02:18:00.580
or the kind of the thing,

2362
02:18:00.581 --> 02:18:03.630
the result is like if you're going to read youtube comments on your,

2363
02:18:03.631 --> 02:18:07.030
or your content to what a,
you got a got a got to have fixed in,

2364
02:18:07.090 --> 02:18:08.620
in real thick skin cause they get,

2365
02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:12.580
it's like they're trying to hurt your feelings.
Like they're trying,

2366
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:18.790
I think they are,
they are,
they can be.
And that's the thing.

2367
02:18:18.791 --> 02:18:20.980
People are creative and creativity is just,

2368
02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:23.170
it's a really broad thing and people didn't,

2369
02:18:23.171 --> 02:18:26.990
when they use creativity to try to like try to get you,
they can,

2370
02:18:27.010 --> 02:18:29.830
if you don't have fixed in.
And I've experienced experiences,
Kate,

2371
02:18:29.831 --> 02:18:32.500
and you don't remember when he used to do the hand auto show.
Right?

2372
02:18:32.510 --> 02:18:36.810
So that's a anytime you're doing like comedy stuff or,
I dunno,

2373
02:18:36.850 --> 02:18:39.280
like any kind of like creative stuff to me,

2374
02:18:39.310 --> 02:18:44.080
your stuff now he's really hard to be like good socks and try to like,
you know,

2375
02:18:44.081 --> 02:18:47.620
so it's kind of easy.
I think we kind of have it easy in that way,

2376
02:18:47.650 --> 02:18:51.070
in that way because if someone's like jock was so stupid or something like that,

2377
02:18:51.130 --> 02:18:54.430
they make themselves look dumb cause it's so obviously not stupid.

2378
02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:57.850
But when you do like a comedy thing,
well at,
to me anyway,
I dunno.

2379
02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:02.230
So when you do like a comedy thing or you know,
something like that,

2380
02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:07.260
there's something of the nature of [inaudible] she'll or bikini girls doing

2381
02:19:07.661 --> 02:19:09.460
lightsaber fights or something like that.

2382
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:13.780
People were going to tear that stuff apart and the stuff they say,
it's like,

2383
02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:14.980
Dang,
I didn't even think about that.

2384
02:19:14.981 --> 02:19:18.370
But now I'm kind of have a complex about my videos now,
you know,
kind of thing.

2385
02:19:18.670 --> 02:19:21.310
So that's how I started on youtube by the way.

2386
02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:26.520
So I was like kind of new to youtube and putting stuff on it when it got it got

2387
02:19:26.590 --> 02:19:29.090
shredded and the feelings,
and here's the thing too,

2388
02:19:29.091 --> 02:19:30.980
but you don't really have thick skin.

2389
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.120
I would say then that that time it was thinner in the beginning.

2390
02:19:35.121 --> 02:19:38.360
I don't think you can really as sick skin unless they have the heads up going
in.

2391
02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.300
So,
and here's the weird thing.
It's like most people,

2392
02:19:41.301 --> 02:19:44.150
they like it because they're fans of Natto or something like that.
But then one,

2393
02:19:44.151 --> 02:19:48.670
one guy now after like 50 comments of like a hobby scoops,
lyrics hold,

2394
02:19:48.671 --> 02:19:52.550
there's videos is funny or whatever,
whatever one guy says it sucks.
You're like,

2395
02:19:52.551 --> 02:19:56.750
fuck it sucks.
I know it's,
you know,
he gets to you.
It's weird how that works.

2396
02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:01.490
Nonetheless,
the point is you reading the youtube comments is a Wacky,
wild,

2397
02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:05.840
bold adventure and I respect you for going,
going on that adventure.

2398
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:09.890
Nonetheless,
Joppa reads them.
So boom,
question answered,
right?

2399
02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:13.490
Was it a question or do they say they don't know?

2400
02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:15.620
You don't use a statement saying straight up.

2401
02:20:15.621 --> 02:20:17.930
They don't really know why we're even writing anything.
Jocko and echo.

2402
02:20:17.931 --> 02:20:20.210
Don't even read these comments.
Meanwhile,

2403
02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:23.630
he wrote that I was borderline like maybe I should just respond for once and
say,

2404
02:20:23.631 --> 02:20:26.290
Hey,
what I'm right here.
We're eating.
Yeah.

2405
02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:29.690
And the darkness that came out of the darkness for once.
Yeah,
man,
that's good.

2406
02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:34.490
Maybe that's another way to engage,
right.
I just figured like Youtube comments,

2407
02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:39.410
um,
is Kinda,
I dunno.
It's not as authentic.
You know,
it doesn't random.
Uh,

2408
02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:43.910
what is your anonymous yeah.
A lot of stuff,
which is kind of a bummer.
Yeah.

2409
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:45.290
Nonetheless,

2410
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:49.790
if you want subscribe to the Youtube Channel for the video version and excerpts,

2411
02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:52.700
which are valuable,
I've come to know the value of,

2412
02:20:52.820 --> 02:20:56.810
of excerpts and um,
you know,
some enhance excerpts.

2413
02:20:56.910 --> 02:21:00.920
Call them enhanced,
put some music on there,
some text,

2414
02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:05.100
kinetic typography.
You know what that is.
Does that sound familiar?
Well,
kinetic,

2415
02:21:05.101 --> 02:21:08.860
I know what that means.
I know what that means,
so I'm putting it together.
Yeah,

2416
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:12.020
man.
So it's,
you know,
Eh,
when you put it on a video,
it's like,
you know,

2417
02:21:12.021 --> 02:21:15.540
the words kind of an get animated on there.
That's what it's called.
Yeah.

2418
02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:19.880
You liked that stuff.
I like it too.
It does.
It becomes kind of captivating.

2419
02:21:20.330 --> 02:21:23.720
Some people are really good at it,
man.
Then they do it anyway.
Nonetheless.

2420
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:26.510
Cool videos on there.
Want to subscribe?
Subscribe.

2421
02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:29.810
Good way to support also chocolate store.

2422
02:21:29.930 --> 02:21:34.340
It's called Jocko store.com.
It's called Jocko store.

2423
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:36.860
The website is [inaudible] dot com that's what I'm saying.

2424
02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:42.140
That's where you can get your shirts.
Same Shirt Jocko wears every day.

2425
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:44.860
The victory MMA shirt.
You can get it there.
Boom.

2426
02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:48.740
Also discipline equals freedom.
Get after it.

2427
02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:53.660
Some bumper stickers on their decals,
on their hoodies,
on their women's stuff,

2428
02:21:53.661 --> 02:21:56.900
on their patches.
Velcro beanies.

2429
02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:02.740
I haven't seen any of these guards are on their cashmere blend directly picked

2430
02:22:05.211 --> 02:22:09.700
from the high mountains of Bulgaria.
Uh,

2431
02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:14.780
well the good news about to be nice is that they're in route,

2432
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:20.000
in route and route in Robert.
That's any car on the way.

2433
02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:24.860
Straight up,
put in the order.
We came down to the all the stuff and then boom,

2434
02:22:24.930 --> 02:22:28.290
they're on the way man.
Straight up.
Well,
you know,
Christmas is on the way.

2435
02:22:28.330 --> 02:22:33.300
I'm just right.
It'd be worth the wait,
I think,

2436
02:22:33.570 --> 02:22:34.403
in my opinion,

2437
02:22:35.130 --> 02:22:38.580
unless it's called Jocko store.com if you want something,

2438
02:22:38.581 --> 02:22:40.650
get something checked out.
The stuff,
if you like it,

2439
02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:44.700
get something good way to support.
Also psychological warfare.

2440
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:45.781
If you didn't know what that is,

2441
02:22:45.781 --> 02:22:50.490
it's an album on iTunes and stitcher and wherever you can buy MP three s it's an

2442
02:22:50.491 --> 02:22:53.970
album [inaudible] album with tracks Jocko tracks.

2443
02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:56.940
I don't think you can buy mp3s on Stitcher,
by the way.
Oh yeah.

2444
02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:00.510
Don't go to stitcher then for good Amazon music or something like that,

2445
02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:04.350
or Google play or wherever else you can get them.

2446
02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:09.630
You understand what I'm saying?
Anyway,
it's a track with Jocko helping you.
Okay.

2447
02:23:09.631 --> 02:23:12.840
When you go on your path,
you have moments of weakness.
We all do.

2448
02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:18.300
All of us do.
Even Jocko,
I think,

2449
02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:23.100
but when we,
when I have moments of weakness,
you know,

2450
02:23:23.130 --> 02:23:27.270
if Jack was there to be like,
hey,
look,
not yell,
I want Jocko yelling at me.

2451
02:23:27.271 --> 02:23:30.990
I don't want anyone yelling.
Really.
Some people do.
I get it.
I respect,

2452
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:35.810
but personally in a lot of us don't want Jocko yelling at us.
No need,

2453
02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:40.580
no need.
Right.
A Yelp is not impactful.
Yeah.

2454
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:43.840
It's a short impact.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2455
02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:47.580
And then the Gelli is kind of like pragmatic telling me like,
oh,

2456
02:23:47.581 --> 02:23:51.660
here's an actual reason why should not mess this workout.
Yup.

2457
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:55.290
And that's exactly what I should not eat this doughnut.
Exactly.
Right.

2458
02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:56.540
That's exactly what it is.

2459
02:23:56.550 --> 02:24:00.390
One of my favorite Twitter things of all time is that little girl from Australia

2460
02:24:00.391 --> 02:24:03.170
saying,
imitating me,
saying sugarcoat.
It

2461
02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:09.510
was good.
100% good.
Yes.
That's a good one.

2462
02:24:09.690 --> 02:24:12.870
Yeah.
Notice you weren't yelling on though.
She kind of made it.

2463
02:24:13.290 --> 02:24:18.240
It's funny the way she heard it was almost like yelling,
you know,

2464
02:24:18.300 --> 02:24:22.280
like she could be coded.
Yeah,

2465
02:24:24.690 --> 02:24:26.340
yeah,
yeah.
Very good.

2466
02:24:26.730 --> 02:24:31.730
Unless it's practical Jocko telling you practically and pragmatically why you

2467
02:24:33.541 --> 02:24:38.541
shouldn't skip to work out why you shouldn't or why procrastination kills you.

2468
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:40.050
So it's like you'll be like,
oh shit.

2469
02:24:40.290 --> 02:24:45.290
It's almost like you gain a deeper understanding of the potential weakness and

2470
02:24:45.570 --> 02:24:50.220
you can get past,
it works a hundred percent success rate.
In my experience,

2471
02:24:50.460 --> 02:24:53.460
Jack.
Well also you've got,
if you want,

2472
02:24:53.461 --> 02:24:57.240
you can get some Jocko white tea and you know what?
Sure,
it tastes good.

2473
02:24:57.241 --> 02:24:59.130
Sure it's got antioxidants in it,
but let's face it,

2474
02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:03.660
there's no other drink that's guaranteeing an 8,000 pound deadlift that no other

2475
02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:07.770
drink.
Not that I know of.
No.
So do you get some Jocko white tea,

2476
02:25:07.771 --> 02:25:11.420
get an 8,000 pound deadlift check.
Next question.
A lot of people do.

2477
02:25:11.421 --> 02:25:12.790
You do all kinds of working out.

2478
02:25:12.850 --> 02:25:17.010
They try and try the triple complex to the OB.

2479
02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:19.350
They could come up with these big plants.
Just drink Jocko white tea.

2480
02:25:19.351 --> 02:25:24.100
You're there,
you know,
no knees,
no need even play around.
Check a

2481
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:28.870
<v 0>books way.
The Warrior Kid,
we talk about staying on the path.
What's the path?</v>

2482
02:25:29.850 --> 02:25:30.240
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2483
02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:31.510
<v 0>Lot of people are looking for the path,</v>

2484
02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:36.790
but what if someone could show you the path?
Well,

2485
02:25:36.791 --> 02:25:37.090
the phone,

2486
02:25:37.090 --> 02:25:42.090
the fact is the path can be found and it's simply and clearly put forward to you

2487
02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:48.601
in the way of the warrior kid books of which there are two and they will put

2488
02:25:49.301 --> 02:25:53.830
kids on the right path.
Is the book everyone wishes they had when they were kids.

2489
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:55.900
Everyone.
Everyone that's read it has said to me,

2490
02:25:55.901 --> 02:25:58.810
I wish I had this when I was getting like,
yeah,
me too.
Me Too.
I didn't have it.

2491
02:25:59.830 --> 02:26:04.830
How to just kind of wander around trying to figure out where the path is.

2492
02:26:04.841 --> 02:26:06.370
But no,
you don't need to have that happen.

2493
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:12.280
So a lot of the path has covered in book one,
but now book two is coming out.

2494
02:26:12.310 --> 02:26:16.480
Weigh the war.
Your kid too.
It's called Mark's mission.
More lessons learned.

2495
02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:20.050
Controlling your temper,
saving money.

2496
02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.510
How to get people to stop making fun of you.

2497
02:26:22.511 --> 02:26:24.610
That's important to know as a little kid,
right?

2498
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:29.080
Controlling fear of failure because a lot of kids,
you don't think of this.

2499
02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:31.930
When you think of fear of failure,
you think of like an adult that say,

2500
02:26:31.931 --> 02:26:34.870
don't you know I don't really for new foot one step out,
man,

2501
02:26:34.871 --> 02:26:38.680
that guy is afraid of failure,
that that's for kids even more so.

2502
02:26:38.770 --> 02:26:40.660
Kids don't even want to try something because we're going afraid they're going

2503
02:26:40.661 --> 02:26:45.040
to look bad.
I remember my daughter when she was 13 my oldest daughter,

2504
02:26:45.041 --> 02:26:48.630
she was 13 years old and she was kind of interested in someone I like,
oh,

2505
02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:51.700
why don't you,
you know,
try it.
And she's like,
I'm too old to start.

2506
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:54.910
She's 13 you know what I mean?

2507
02:26:54.970 --> 02:26:58.230
So how do you get kids to come over that?
Well,
you,

2508
02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:01.570
you introduce them to these books,
building a business.

2509
02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:06.010
That's something that kids don't think about very often.
They should be.

2510
02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:08.680
They should be thinking about starting businesses,

2511
02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:13.060
earning money when they're young.
Learning the value of money when they're young,

2512
02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:14.470
they should absolutely be learned about.

2513
02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:18.100
This book is going to make every kid better.
It'll make them a warrior kid.

2514
02:27:18.101 --> 02:27:20.620
So here's what you do.
You preorder the book.

2515
02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:24.130
Now that's my recommendation marks mission,
preorder the book.

2516
02:27:24.131 --> 02:27:28.150
Now there's a couple reasons why.
Number one,
you don't,

2517
02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:30.400
it's happened with other books that I've come out with.

2518
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:33.250
If you don't order it preorder,
then guess what?

2519
02:27:33.251 --> 02:27:37.090
You go to order and it's not out of stock and then you're mad at me.
Everyone's,

2520
02:27:37.091 --> 02:27:41.050
Ooh,
were supplied.
Bandwidth is working really well there,
Jocko.
Hey,
okay.

2521
02:27:41.051 --> 02:27:44.590
I'll take ownership of that.
Guess what?
Order the book and you'd have it.

2522
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:49.150
How's that?
That's my recommendation.
So if you ordered,

2523
02:27:49.151 --> 02:27:51.970
the other thing that's good about it is if you order,

2524
02:27:51.971 --> 02:27:56.890
it spreads the word and more kids will hear about it because there's no big

2525
02:27:56.950 --> 02:28:01.480
advertising.
I just got a thing the other day from somebody who was a uh,

2526
02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:04.870
social media.
I think it was Twitter.
You know,
you might want to check with your,

2527
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:07.770
I don't know what your marketing teams telling you,
like,
Hey,

2528
02:28:07.771 --> 02:28:11.350
I don't have a marketing team over here.
To me and echo,
we're kicking it.

2529
02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:14.890
So if you want to help spread the word order the book,

2530
02:28:14.891 --> 02:28:19.891
it's due out April 24th it's way the warrior kid to Mark's.

2531
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:26.420
And if you want to see a,
an actual warrior kid in action,
checkout Irish oaks,

2532
02:28:26.421 --> 02:28:28.820
ranch.com Aiden,
he's a warrior kid.

2533
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.850
He's only 12 years old but has his own business speaking to businesses.

2534
02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:36.860
You can get his soap that he makes from goat milk.
Very good soap by the way.

2535
02:28:36.930 --> 02:28:37.763
Yeah,

2536
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:42.830
it's got a good motto to the motto of the soap is stay clean.
Sounds simple,

2537
02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:46.580
but you know what?
There's a lot of layers.
There's a,

2538
02:28:46.581 --> 02:28:50.270
don't forget the discipline equals freedom field manual eating,
thinking,

2539
02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:54.350
fighting,
working out life.

Get the manual on how to live your life.

2541
02:28:58.490 --> 02:29:01.300
The field manual discipline equals freedom for the amp,

2542
02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:05.450
for the audio version of that.
You can't find it on audible cause it's not there.

2543
02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:09.980
The audio version of discipline equals freedom field manual is on iTunes,

2544

2549

2550
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:37.870
It's got knowledge and lessons learned from the battlefield and business and

life.
