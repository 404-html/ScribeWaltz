00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.400
This is Jocko podcast number one 67 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.310
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.420
Beware of that trap.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.410
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.500
<v 0>choose dear Beowulf.
The better part.</v>

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.430
Eternal rewards do not give way to pride for a brief while your strength is in

7
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:28.294
bloom.

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.430
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.430
<v 0>but it fades quickly and soon there will follow illness or the sword to lay you</v>

10
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:40.871
low or a sudden fire or surge of water or jabbing blade or javelin from the air

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.320
or repelling to age.

12
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.220
Your piercing I will dim and dark skin

13
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.130
and death will arrive.
Dear Warrior

14
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.180
to sweep you away

15
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.440
and that right there is some

16
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.290
timeless wisdom offered by the

17
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.070
the epic poem.
Beowulf.

18
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.850
<v 0>The first poem in the English language,
of course it's old English,</v>

20
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.400
which is mutually unintelligible from the modern English that we speak,

21
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:31.780
but it has some incredible translations if you want to read it.

22
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.510
I recommend the Seamus Haney version,

23
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.760
but regardless of the translation translation that you get,

24
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.260
the story remains.
It has do on the lessons,

25
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.180
lessons based on war
and leadership

26
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.810
and really human nature.

27
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.570
And we find these lessons over and over and over again throughout history and in

28
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.590
different cultures and in different wars.

29
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.290
And we all continue to learn,

30
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.300
<v 1>okay,</v>

31
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.640
<v 0>every day from history and from each other.</v>

32
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.940
And it certainly seems that there are some principles that are universal.

33
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.620
There are some underlying unifying theories that bind together then thread

34
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:35.340
through leadership and war and human nature.

35
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.950
And the more we experience in life,

36
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.510
the more clearly we can see the thread of these unifying theories.

37
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.640
I am tonight,

38
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.700
I happen to have on the podcast and individual with a lot of experience,

39
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.700
experience in war,
experience in leadership and experience in life.

40
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.810
And he also happens to be someone that I grew up with in the seal teams who is a

41
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.280
great friend and who just retired a couple days ago as a seal master chief,

42
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.140
my friend and my brother by the name of Jason Gardner.

43
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.870
Jason Jocko,
thanks for coming on math.

44
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.170
<v 2>Hey,
I'm really excited to be here.</v>

45
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.840
<v 0>And,
um,</v>

46
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.600
it's kind of cool because I know that you listen to the podcast and you were one

47
00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:45.080
of the first guys that reached out to me.

48
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.330
I don't even know what number podcast it was,

49
00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:50.240
but you reached out to me really early and said,
hey,
this is kick ass man,

50
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.620
keep doing it.
And then you know,

51
00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:55.910
as the podcast kind of spread,

52
00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:58.820
I started hearing from more guys but that was a pretty,

53
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.930
you were literally the first guy that reached out to me and said,
bro,

54
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.690
keep it going.
And I said,
cool Wilco.

55
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.080
<v 2>That's awesome.
Yeah.
And like iris is the one that said,
told me,</v>

56
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:14.520
Hey Jocko has got a podcast.
And I'm like,
oh,
okay.
She goes,

57
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:19.320
you don't know how to listen to podcasts to you said no.
Gave her my phone.

58
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.400
She got it set up.

59
00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:24.660
It was episode six and within a week and a half because of my commute,

60
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.110
I was caught up and then just dialed in from there on out and talking about it,

61
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:33.750
sharing it with a lot of other guys and it's been a huge help to me.

62
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.950
<v 0>That's awesome.
And yeah,
if anyone hasn't put this together yet.
Uh,</v>

63
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.140
this is iris and gardeners husband and Iris was on podcast number 70.

64
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.910
So if you want to listen to that,
you can hear us talk about you,

65
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:52.570
I guess indirectly because you were still active duty in the day,

66
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.410
so.
All right,
let's get to your story.
Let's talk about you.

67
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.350
Okay.
Where'd you grow up?

68
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.540
<v 2>Uh,
I,
my dad was in the Marine Corps,
so we moved around a little bit,</v>

69
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:12.280
kind of settled down,
up in San Clemente here in Orange County,
grew up up there,

70
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.480
uh,
swam,
played water polo,

71
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.950
did that through high school and then,
uh,
yeah,

72
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.430
I think I started doing a martial art card,

73
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:29.320
college of camp on one of the instructors was a team guy in Vietnam or dairy and

74
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.290
add it back in the day,
you know,
I had no one knew what seals were.
Yeah.

75
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.070
And then my parents had found out that,

76
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:39.620
that he was a COO and Vietnam and they're like,
oh,
you know,
this guy was a seal.

77
00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:43.630
And I'm like,
well,
what is that?
And then they said,
these guys are awesome.

78
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.420
It's really hard training their water warriors,

79
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:50.530
which was super appealing growing up at the beach and water polo and swimming.

80
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:55.531
So then I just latched onto that and that's what what I got after and enlisted

81
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.090
right out of after high school.
So it was your dad,

82
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.780
was your dad kind of like the stereotypical marine that was just like,

83
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.270
oh no,
like acting like a drill.
Started charging.
I know my dad,

84
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:12.620
my dad was super laid back easy.
It's an easy going,

85
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.220
good guy.
And he was a Jag officer in the Marine Corps,
so he was like,
uh,

86
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.610
an attorney.
Um,
but,

87
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.460
but not definitely not your stereotypical marina.

88
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:25.130
And at one point I was thinking about going in the Marine Corps and he talked me

89
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:29.990
out of it.
I don't do it,
don't do it.
And he's like,
Hey,

90
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:33.400
the navy,
the seal teams is closed loops.
Or You could go to recon,
Ben,

91
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:36.170
at the time it wasn't closed loops.
So you'd go in and out,
in and out.
He goes,

92
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.670
you don't want to do that.
You want to do this.

93
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.240
And then steer now has mar soc,

94
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:45.350
which you can just go in and you can be a special operations guy for your whole

95
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:47.750
career.
What is closed loop?
What does that mean?
Meaning?

96
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.730
So what I just said about the marine corps,

97
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.240
like now you can go in the marine corps and you can just be in special

98
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:58.190
operations for your whole career.
Before you could go for what would,

99
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.240
how,
how long of a tour where they do two or three deployments at a,
at a special,

100
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:05.420
I don't think it was like a three year tour or six years.

101
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:07.700
They would do it a command and then I'd have to go somewhere else.

102
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.150
They might go back to an infantry unit or or something like that.

103
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.610
And that's called like a open loop open loop,

104
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:16.940
meaning that you don't necessarily stay in the job you want the whole time.

105
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.453
Now

106
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.990
at what point did you start listening to heavy metal punk rock and hardcore

107
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.750
music?
Cause I know that's the first like connection you and I had,

108
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:30.740
which I don't know,

109
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.910
is there some weird sort of thing when you just like look at some other guide

110
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.330
bourbon?
The dude,
this guy's into hardcore.
I,
I mean it's not little.

111
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.750
It's not like I walked up and said,
hey,
what kind of music do you like?

112
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.610
It would just like immediate,
you just know,
right?
Yeah.
It,

113
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.660
I don't know what the bone of fees are actually on that.
Um,
yeah,
shoot,

114
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:54.680
I explored around with like a lot of different music and it just wasn't enough.

115
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.310
You know,
it's like,
oh,
okay,
well I'll listen to the doors strikeouts.

116
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.740
I liked them for a little bit in man then,

117
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.290
and it was kind of an investment to buy an album back in those days or to find

118
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:10.400
even any punk rock.
So I found,
I think like a dead Kennedys album,

119
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:14.260
fresh fruit for rotting vegetables.
That was kind of like my gateway drug.
Uh,

120
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.000
and then I'm like,
oh,
okay,
this is really getting me moving.

121
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.670
Um,
then I remember,

122
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.850
I think I was 14 or 15 when I went to my first show up at UC Irvine.

123
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.990
It was like pil,
which was Johnny rotten span.
And uh,

124
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.300
I,
I saw,
I,
you know,
and in a mosh pit was just like,

125
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.840
what is this?
I want to live here.

126
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.650
I want to get a mailbox right outside this thing and just stay in here at this

127
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:49.940
point of friction circling around and around forever.
And I was like,
boom.

128
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.800
That was it.
Then,
you know,

129
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.470
discovered Gbh and Orange County had a really,

130
00:08:55.471 --> 00:09:00.471
really like probably a one of the biggest scenes in the world at the time for

131
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:05.250
all the music that would come through there or was going out of there.

132
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:09.650
So Gbh,
uh,
the Dui uniform choice was,

133
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.540
was guys and I glommed in later in high school.
Those guys were awesome than an,

134
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.900
and you knew the guys from uniform?
No,
I didn't,

135
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.140
but I really liked their music and I liked their message because some of the

136
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:25.500
other stuff like,
okay,
rage against the machine for instance.
Yeah,

137
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.810
I liked the music.
I just can't get behind the lyrics,
you know,
or Cro mags.

138
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:31.890
That was a great example.

139
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.820
I love the music and I like the lyrics to cause it's good,

140
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:37.980
like get after it stuff so,

141
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.520
and then they're just maybe that that buzzing.

142
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.810
I don't know what guys did in other wars when for sure no music to go in and

143
00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:53.561
listen to listening to kill them all instead of listening to puff the Magic

144
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:54.564
Dragon.
Right?

145
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.650
<v 0>That's literally what's what Americans were listening to.</v>

146
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.730
Like they're listening to puff the magic dragon and those folk music bands.

147
00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:02.650
And I mean,

148
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.710
I guess maybe at the outside edge somebody might've been listening to Hendrix or

149
00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:11.150
something.
That's a little harder.
But yeah.
Yeah.

150
00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:15.770
To me there's a,
there's a,
this is just straight up the way it is.

151
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.570
Some human beings,

152
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.350
I would say normally boys have this thing in their head that wants to fight and

153
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.900
wants to break things.
And,
and,

154
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.860
and when you hear your example,
the doors,
you're like,
okay,
well this is,
you know,

155
00:10:36.861 --> 00:10:40.160
you hear light my fire and you're okay.
Like I'm kind of,

156
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.740
I'm feeling a little something there.
And then you hear the Crow Max and you go,

157
00:10:45.741 --> 00:10:49.550
oh,
okay.
You hear Motorhead and you go,
oh,
okay,
this is,
this is me,

158
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.050
this is what I'm talking about right here.

159
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.140
I completely understand this music right now.
Yeah.

160
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.780
<v 2>And in that trust,
and they can just pick it up and other people.
Yeah.</v>

161
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.940
<v 0>Then so</v>

162
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.031
<v 2>that,</v>

163
00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:10.031
and then like I stuck with punk rock for a long time and then a buddy of mine in

164
00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:14.660
high school who I swam with Steve Rosenthal is like,
hey,

165
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:18.380
you should check out Metallica.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
And then they were like,

166
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.950
they crossed me over to where I'm like,
oh no,
now I like speed metal too.

167
00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:25.700
And then finally I found my way to slayer and kind of stuck with them forever

168
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.420
and slayers on a continual loop in the back of my head all the time.

169
00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:31.990
And it's always surfacing up or down.
Um,

170
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.020
but now it's like really by exception that I listened to it because it just

171
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:38.450
can't listen to it all day.
I can be that fired up,

172
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:42.330
but still really good.
Yeah,

173
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.080
<v 0>it is.
And so then you enlisted in the navy,
you go to bus and this time,</v>

174
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.393
what years it,

175
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.950
<v 2>uh,
I went in [inaudible] 87 and then up to great lakes.</v>

176
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:58.300
Did Gunner's mate a school up there?
Uh,

177
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:03.390
and so I think I checked into bud sometime in May or June of [inaudible] 88 and

178
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.863
eight

179
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.250
<v 0>paired where you for buds,
you know,
a lot of people don't listen to this.</v>

180
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.150
We'll think they want to go to buds or whatever and they're paranoid about what

181
00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:14.580
they can do to prepare.
And I know,

182
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.800
I'm assuming you probably did something similar to why did,

183
00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:18.630
cause we had no idea what was going on.

184
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.630
Having no idea what the training was like the video,

185
00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:24.510
you probably watched the same video as me if they even had that video.

186
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.990
That one special.
Yeah.
So he wants to be someone special and you think,
well,

187
00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:31.530
in order to get ready for the seal teams,
what I need to do is look cool,

188
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.840
wear all black and be cool.

189
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.470
But there was no,
Hey,
here's the protocol to get good at pull ups.

190
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.980
Here's the protocol to get good at swimming with fins.
None of that.

191
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.650
<v 2>No,
no.
And it then,
you know,</v>

192
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:49.500
like in bootcamp I have found that we actually got out of shape,

193
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.540
me and the other,
there was another guy in,
in,

194
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.350
in my bootcamp class that actually just retired as a mass chief as well.

195
00:12:55.351 --> 00:13:00.351
And we would go in the bathroom and do pull ups in on the stalls just to try and

196
00:13:00.361 --> 00:13:04.520
stay in shape.
Um,
one thing I didn't do enough is Brian,

197
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.920
it's I hated running and then I was in every goon squad until I think third

198
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:17.100
phase.
Then it clicked and I was already a really good swimmers in the water.

199
00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:21.180
Wasn't an issue for me,
but I was just hammering a goon goon squad,
you know,

200
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.020
it's when you're towards the back of the deal and,
and they're like,
okay,

201
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.060
you guys are done.
You're,
you're doing this run.

202
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.040
The rest of you start doing pushups,

203
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:33.150
hit the surf and they just mess with you forever.
Feel like the first,

204
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.930
all through first phase,
every time Darren,

205
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.790
I threw up because I was gonna,

206
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.350
I was like inches in front of failing and just had to reach deep and,

207
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.870
and push,
push it across the finish line.

208
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.500
<v 0>You said there were some what,</v>

209
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:49.680
what happened at Sanko you were telling me the other day about something
happens.

210
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.060
Sank.
Oh,
what was that?

211
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.990
<v 2>So it was like before you started training free training,
they said,
hey,</v>

212
00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:58.400
we need volunteers to come out to San Clemente island to help out with,
uh,

213
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.190
the class that was was out there and you'd just kind of go and work behind the

214
00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:05.430
scenes with the staff out there at San Clemente island.

215
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.800
And so I think like the second night,
uh,
I was out there,

216
00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:15.801
we were in Chow and instructors and students are eating in the same room as this

217
00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.540
little quonset hut.
And they had,
it was Taco night.

218
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.040
And so there was a big sign up there when you went up to get served.
Like,
Hey,

219
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.340
only two tacos.
So when I got up there,
the cook is like,

220
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.620
there was only one taco left.
He goes,
hey,

221
00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:31.830
just come back when I'm making some more,
come back up here and get one.

222
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.780
So I hit my one Taco,
went back up to get my next one.
He's like,
here you go.

223
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.490
And as I'm walking with my tray back,
one of the instructor says to me,
Hey,

224
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.000
didn't you already eat two tacos?
And I'm like,
oh my goodness,

225
00:14:45.001 --> 00:14:48.420
I didn't know what to do.
So I said,
no.
And then I tried to keep going.

226
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.660
Well it was the phase officer,
you know,
he wasn't wearing any rank,
insignia,

227
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:56.120
Sudan,
all the other instructors leap up.

228
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:01.150
They're all huge and they just start screaming at me and I'm thinking to myself

229
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.010
or I've already ruined it.

230
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.210
So we got an even eat the Taco.

231
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:13.160
I just got out of there and I went back to uh,
where you know,
our little hut,

232
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:16.040
where we were sleeping and I just went to bed.

233
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.590
It was like at 5:00 PM because I was like,
oh no.

234
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.560
Then the next morning at 4:00 AM,

235
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.650
there's a knock on the door and one of the guys opens up the door and it's one

236
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:28.190
of the students that's actually in the class.
And he goes,
Hey,

237
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:33.050
is there a gardener in here?
And then everyone just looks at me,
you know,

238
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.520
and uh,
and I'm like,
yeah,
I'm back here.
And they go,

239
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.530
they want you down at the beach.
So I got dressed and went down there.
You know,

240
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:44.990
I feel like I'm going to Castle Dracula and like,
Oh,

241
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:45.860
what are they gonna do to me?

242
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.430
So the instructors are all circled up in the phase officer's there.
He goes,

243
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.560
Gardiner,
get over here.
It's like over there.
And he goes,

244
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.960
he hands me a thermometer and he goes,
we need to get the Watertown.

245
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.600
So you're going to go out in the water up to your waist and you're going to stay

246
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:01.130
there and do not you.

247
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.070
I need you to go all the way to your waist and you going to stay there for two

248
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:07.190
minutes.
Don't come in early.
And I'm like,
who?
Yah.

249
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:12.380
So I take it and I just go,
I go out until I'm just treading water.

250
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.160
But as I,
I'm like,
ah,
I see how this is going to go.
Right.
So then,

251
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.140
and I didn't even look at my watch,

252
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.260
I just stayed there until finally they're like getting your dummy.

253
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.560
So I come running in and hand him the uh,
uh,

254
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.710
thermometer and they check it was like 53 degrees or something like that and

255
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.650
they're like,
get out of your gardener.
And uh,

256
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.920
they did did this like one other time and then they just decided it's not going

257
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:39.800
to be fun to pick on this guy.
And that's what I kind of figured was going on.

258
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:44.420
I just like,
oh,
okay.
Um,
don't give them a reaction.
Don't give them reaction.

259
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.340
And uh,
and then they,
they went to,
I found someone else to mess with,

260
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:53.000
but the guys in the class later told me that the group of pre trainings that was

261
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:55.760
out there before our group came out.

262
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.450
Like they had one guy that they would just harass and they would just make them

263
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:02.840
burst into tears every time.
In the end quitting before even started training.

264
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.490
But you know,
you talk about this a lot on the podcast,

265
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:11.990
how seal platoons are just super aggressive and they're like anybody looking for

266
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:16.880
any weakness and if you show weakness it's going to get hammered and then you're

267
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:20.150
like,
no response,
no response.
You got to,

268
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.320
you got to have normal face stifle your emotions or your life is going to be

269
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:28.010
miserable until you figure out how to deal with whatever that weakness is.

270
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:31.710
The thing.
There's a couple things that really bothered me in the world.
Uh,

271
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.640
and I won't tell anyone what they are.
No one knows.

272
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.850
Not One single person knows what really,
really like.
There's a couple things.

273
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.340
If I,
if a seal platoon would have known these things,

274
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.420
I would have been eaten alive.
But I never ever say,

275
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:48.470
and I won't tell anyone right now ever,
I'll put it in my will when I die.

276
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.160
It'll be like,
hey,
you

277
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.780
<v 0>guys missed a huge opportunity because I know and sometimes it's things that can</v>

278
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:56.450
happen with team guys just anyways,

279
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.460
just things happen and if you let it show you're doomed.

280
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.580
<v 2>You are or,</v>

281
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.810
or they just hammered that weakness until that nerve is dead and it doesn't

282
00:18:07.811 --> 00:18:08.670
bother you anymore.

283
00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.490
<v 0>Get to work you through it in a nice gentle way.
And did you have any,
so you,</v>

284
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:18.940
you,
you were crappy runner obviously,
and you,
so that was a gut check.

285
00:18:18.941 --> 00:18:23.380
That's like me.
I every run,
I failed one run after that run every run I did.

286
00:18:23.381 --> 00:18:27.670
I just ran as hard as I possibly could sprint for the,
for until we were done,

287
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.920
until I was done.
Uh,
would,

288
00:18:29.921 --> 00:18:33.950
did anything else trip you up at all in buds because every,

289
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.130
all the water stuff was easy.
Pool comp,
lifesaving,

290
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.950
all that stuff was easy cause you did water.

291
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.600
<v 2>Yeah.
And nothing about buds is easy,
but um,</v>

292
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.990
it was all stuff that I was really accustomed to.
And so the,
so it was like,
uh,

293
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.600
this is no big deal.
It's just no big deal.
That,
but it,
it was freaking brutal.

294
00:18:50.601 --> 00:18:54.830
Like I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't want to do it again,
that's for sure.
Um,

295
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.370
and then,
but the truth of it is like as cool as I was in buds,

296
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.420
colder in the team,
so I was tired.
I was in buds,
tired around the team.

297
00:19:02.421 --> 00:19:07.040
So yeah.
Um,
great guys.

298
00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:08.080
It was a great experience.

299
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.360
<v 0>I finished up,
did you finish up with dive face?</v>

300
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.820
I finished with a land warfare,

301
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.420
so they switched it somewhere around when I was there,

302
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:22.320
which was 1991 that's,
it was just before we got there that we switched to,

303
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.190
in fact,
I think there was actually a class that did it the opposite way.

304
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.400
Did it the old way,
the way you did it before,
right.

305
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.500
That that was still there when I got there.
So

306
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.290
<v 2>right.
It was because of pool calm is because it puts so many guys get kicked out</v>

307
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:37.500
during pool comp that they're like,
why are we waiting until the end to do this?

308
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.480
Let's shift it over.

309
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:38.841
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

310
00:19:38.841 --> 00:19:43.820
Pool competency is something that I knew zero about when I was coming into the,

311
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.560
into buds.
And they had,

312
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.770
they had a poster in the med medical area by the grinder over there and it was a

313
00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:54.070
Texas chainsaw massacre poster.
And,

314
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.560
and yet they had written the Texas or the buds pool comp massacre and it had

315
00:19:57.561 --> 00:19:59.900
like a guy with a regulator getting ripped out of his mouth and,

316
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.180
and who's the killer?
And um,
oh,
Leatherface Leatherface was,
you know,

317
00:20:05.181 --> 00:20:07.850
like how to like an EDT seal instructor tee shirt on.

318
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.450
And I just remember walking by it,
I was checking in or whatever and I go,
oh,

319
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.260
I wonder what that's all about.
And then I found out that,
yeah,
they're going to,

320
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.540
they're going to crush you in the water.
And what about then you go to,

321
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.300
you went to old school,
airborne school.

322
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.090
<v 2>Oh yeah.
How's that for you?
So it was really good,</v>

323
00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:27.430
but I was,
you know,
I was really,

324
00:20:27.431 --> 00:20:31.570
really cocky and when I go back and examine my cockiness,
it was just,

325
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.740
here's the deal.
I was super insecure and uh,

326
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.280
and then compensate for it by being cocky and a hope,

327
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:43.370
hopes it no one figures out how insecure I am.
But anyway,
uh,

328
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.920
the physical aspect of jump school,
you know,
runs and stuff,

329
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:50.200
it's so easy and then,

330
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:54.040
but you kind of get throttled back where it's kind of a bootcamp mentality.

331
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:55.000
You're not used to it.

332
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.020
So me and the guys we were going out drinking on and there's rules you're not

333
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:00.130
supposed to drink on a week night.

334
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:05.131
And we were out drinking on a weeknight or it was like a Sunday night on the

335
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.110
night before,
one of the last,
before the final week of jump weeks.
And,
uh,

336
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:16.120
I went up to get a pitcher of beer at the bar there.
And,
uh,

337
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.980
the guy who was the bartender turns out he was a black cat.

338
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:26.290
And so he's like,
Hey,
are you jump school?
And I'm like,
Oh yeah,

339
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.150
yeah,
I'm a jump school.
And he goes,

340
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:32.200
you're not supposed to be drinking on weeknights.
And then I,
I'm like,
yeah,
well,

341
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:36.940
whatever.
And he goes,
do you know who I am?
And,
and I said,
no.

342
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.140
And he goes,
I'm a black cat.
And he said it in a manner where like,

343
00:21:40.141 --> 00:21:43.990
there should've been some spooky music playing behind it and a,
um,

344
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.560
and I was like,
okay,
well if you don't think I can,
you know,

345
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.340
drink this beer and do the PT and running in the morning and you're out of your

346
00:21:51.341 --> 00:21:54.700
mind.
And He,
and he's like,
get out of my bar,
rightly so,
kicked me out.

347
00:21:55.150 --> 00:22:00.150
So we leave the next morning we're on the bus on the way to the drop zone for

348
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:06.490
the first jump and there's kind of a commotion outside.

349
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.623
And I look,

350
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:12.340
and there's that guy that was the bartender with his and he's with one of our

351
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:15.610
guys,
cause he was in a different phase.
And so they pulled everybody off.

352
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:19.510
The bus lined us up,
he walked down,
he goes,
Oh,

353
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.560
here's the guy.
They blew me out of the lineup,
um,

354
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.150
pulled me behind,
uh,
one of the buildings and tuned me up,
you know,

355
00:22:28.151 --> 00:22:31.630
I kinda deserved,
I did,
didn't it kind of,
I deserved it.

356
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:36.400
And so they let me have it.
And then that was it.

357
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.460
I went back and did three or four more jumps and then I was getting ready to do

358
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:47.160
my fifth jump,
which is the last jump there at jump school.
And uh,

359
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.640
the liaison officer came and pulled me out and said,
hey,

360
00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:55.270
you were drinking on a week night.
I've got the statement,

361
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.770
you're,
I'm pulling you out of this thing and I'm going to take you to Njp,

362
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.750
which nonjudicial punishment,
copies mass.
So I was like,
Hey,

363
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:08.650
wait a minute.
These guys chewed me out,
you know,
tuned me up a little bit.

364
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.980
By that,
I mean a gut punched me and I had,
you know,
had it come in,

365
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:16.420
it's all good and uh,
you know,
it was going to be done there.
And he goes,

366
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:20.650
nope,
we're not having this.
This isn't it.
So you're,
you're going to go to mass.

367
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:25.450
So I got pulled out of the class,
the class graduated and left,

368
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.370
and then this is like Friday,
you know,

369
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.280
they did their last jump to the graduation.

370
00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:34.870
I was got put in a holding company and then I went to captain's mast

371
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.920
in front of the Marine Corps,

372
00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:41.530
Lieutenant colonel that was kind of like the officer out there and towards the

373
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:45.950
navy and Marines going through jump school and uh,
you know,
I,
my dad,

374
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.640
because he was still active duty at the time and he's like a Jag and Jag score.

375
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.200
Yeah.
But he couldn't pull any strings.
He's like,
Hey,

376
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.880
you're just going to have to go in there and own it.

377
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.070
So I go in,
I,
you know,
I sit,
sit in the room,

378
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:06.230
coming into the guy's office.
They read me the rights,

379
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.210
they read the statement against me,
which,

380
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.580
which is basically the story I just told you today.

381
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.700
Any Bella still a little bit more,
but it's all good.
And so

382
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.613
the colonel,

383
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.840
he reads his stuff and then he just looks up at me and I'm standing at attention

384
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:24.620
and I'm,
I think I'm okay.
I've done it again.
I'm going to get thrown out.

385
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.690
And he goes,
uh,
do you,
do you have anything to say for yourself?
And I said,
uh,

386
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.930
sir,
that's pretty much what happened.
You know,
the statement that he read out.

387
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:37.700
And I said,
uh,
uh,

388
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.350
I've embarrassed the navy and by and turn the Marine Corps and all I can do is

389
00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:44.360
take my lumps and press on with my career.

390
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.380
And then he just stared at me and he goes,

391
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.220
I find you 100 bucks for one month and I'll let you reclass up with the next

392
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:54.050
class and do your final jump and get outta here.

393
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.590
And so you got $100 extra a month jump pay.

394
00:24:58.591 --> 00:25:02.030
So it was really kind of a wash.
It was awesome.

395
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.520
And then the,
the one guy that had pulled me out of line and,

396
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:11.210
and brought me in there to mass,
he's like,
you know,

397
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:14.570
who told you what to say?
But I found that,

398
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:17.420
and I've always told young guys in the military career,
just own it.

399
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.470
If you get in trouble,
own,

400
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.380
it's when you make excuses that you run into trouble.
But when you're like,

401
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.870
this is what I did.
Most things that people have done,

402
00:25:26.871 --> 00:25:30.110
guys have come close to doing or didn't just didn't get in trouble for.

403
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.560
And when you own it,

404
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:37.100
it just works out better in the end to those every time.
No doubt about that.

405
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.620
Uh,
so now you go back to back to the team,
very your team five,

406
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.880
checking a team five.
We didn't have SQT then.

407
00:25:46.881 --> 00:25:51.260
So what they did with us was,
uh,
we just kind of bounced around.

408
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:55.820
So I worked in a different department at the team that worked in diving for a

409
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.920
couple of weeks.
Works,
worked in ordinance for a couple of weeks.

410
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.640
And I think I was at the team for about four months and in those days of the

411
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:03.110
team didn't deploy,

412
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.510
we all always had two platoons pushed forward and the command was back.
So,
uh,

413
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.840
I think I was probably four or five months at the team.
Went out to Niland,

414
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:18.620
worked at the old cap camp out there as a camp guard,
was great experience.

415
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:22.520
And uh,
and then,
uh,

416
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.550
got in my first platoon,
which was an arg alpha.

417
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:30.520
So we did the whole deployment on a ship.
And,
uh,
that was,
that was great.

418
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.860
Had done some awesome guys in that platoon.

419
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.980
A platoon chief was his guy named Bill Kune,

420
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.830
who's passed away now and it really miss him,

421
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:44.460
but he was just super even Keel,

422
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.990
quiet,
direct.
You never really saw him lose his temper and a,

423
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:53.120
a good,
good man.
Good example for all of us.
And then,
uh,

424
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.050
and then a couple other guys I'll get into here in a second.
Uh,
you know,

425
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:02.490
and then we wound up deploying on the ship and we did a longer workup.

426
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.170
Then it was,
we did a,

427
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.320
like almost a year long workup because we were going in the Ark.

428
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:09.900
We had to do everything.
Guys were normally doing like an eight month or,

429
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:11.580
and then they do a six months to Pei.

430
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.990
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
well,
when I did,
because I did two arcs,
you know,</v>

431
00:27:15.991 --> 00:27:18.840
for those of you who don't know it's deploying on a ship.
When we did that,

432
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.420
it would be,
we'd do the normal workup,

433
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:26.070
but we do the normal workup before we started our interoperability with the navy

434
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:30.090
and the Marine Corps.
So that tacked on that that text on their workup,

435
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.250
the Navy workup in the Marine Corps workup.

436
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:36.660
So it was like we did two workups kind of and it was awesome training.

437
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.050
I got so much out of out of that.
But then where did you,

438
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:41.010
where'd you guys go on deployment?

439
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.670
<v 2>Well we started in our west pack and we were,</v>

440
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:50.510
we'd just gotten into the Philippines when the Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and

441
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:52.140
all that stuff kicked off.

442
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.440
So then we pushed over for Operation Desert Shield and then was a thought we

443
00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:00.900
were going to go home.

444
00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:04.890
We made it back to the Philippines and then we stopped there and the Pi for like

445
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:09.891
three weeks and then turn back around and went back over for a Operation Desert

446
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.780
Storm.
Did you guys do anything?
We just did a bump.
So we did,
uh,

447
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.060
the tanker boardings sure.

448
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.280
Like you talk about did a couple of those and then we had a bunch of different

449
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:27.591
operations that we had slated on some of the islands off the coast there that we

450
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:31.350
would,
we got all the way to the point of doing rehearsals forum.

451
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.790
And then like the Iraqis would have just abandon the island or a cup.

452
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.440
One of the times when the Halos flew over to do a recon,

453
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:40.950
they surrendered to the helicopters and they just sent helicopters in there and

454
00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:44.400
took all,
took all the Rockies over.
But uh,
um,

455
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.000
admiral McRaven was our task unit commander at the time and uh,
so that was cool.

456
00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:54.030
He,
he was,
he was really good to work for.
And then,
uh,

457
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.160
like one of the guys in the platoon that I,

458
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.800
that I told you I reached out to him cause I wanted to mention him because he's

459
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.580
kind of a bigger than life seal was Steve Hines.

460
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.230
And Steve is,
is,
he's a big guy.

461
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:12.210
He's all,
you know,
at the time,
tatted up quite a bit,
which in the early nineties,

462
00:29:12.211 --> 00:29:15.120
a lot,
not a lot of the guys had tattoos.
He,
uh,

463
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.650
at some point in a bar fight,
someone had cut him up with a knife.

464
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.310
So he has these amazing scars,
criss crossing his chest.

465
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.100
He's really smart.

466
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:31.130
He's got a razor sharp wit wit and was just a lot of fun to work with.

467
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.590
One of those guys,
where is,
he is bad as things ever got.
He's always cracking,

468
00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:41.290
you know,
cracking jokes.
So it's always funny.
Takes the edge off it.

469
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.270
And one of the things that he did really well was,
you know,

470
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:47.350
when you're on a ship,

471
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.400
you're on the ship and there are some guys that decide they're going to be

472
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:55.210
condescending to everybody and uh,
you know,

473
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:59.620
it just doesn't get you far in life.
Steve Brand,
uh,
PT for the ship.

474
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.650
So we would do our own physical training in the morning.

475
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.040
And then he had one that he would run in the afternoon and he would invite

476
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:10.900
everybody to it.
And the captain of the ship came to his PT,

477
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.840
the master chief for the ship was there.
Um,

478
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.990
by the end of the deployment we would have,

479
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:20.890
most of the flight deck would be covered with guys coming to his PT and then

480
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:25.780
he'd be cracking jokes the whole time everybody loved him.
We would do like,

481
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:27.820
okay,
hey,
we're going to do a fantail shoot.

482
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:31.480
And we would have different people from the ship come up and we would let them

483
00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:34.930
shoot our guns and be their range safety officers.
So it's like,
hey,

484
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.980
all the guys that work in the Galley,
you know in the galleys are mess hall,

485
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.220
come out,
we're going to run a shoot for you.
And then then what happens?

486
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.090
They hook you up with food,
you know,

487
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:50.770
you everybody chicken patties,
chicken patties,
you know,

488
00:30:50.771 --> 00:30:52.270
maybe some extra dessert.

489
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.400
And then everybody just looked out for us and it was so good.

490
00:30:57.401 --> 00:30:58.780
It paid off in spades

491
00:30:59.420 --> 00:30:59.720
<v 0>and I'm,</v>

492
00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.720
the of building relationships with people is just such a benefit across the

493
00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:09.410
board and I certainly learned that literally getting extra chicken patties and

494
00:31:09.411 --> 00:31:14.411
extra chicken nuggets because I was bros with the dude working in the front line

495
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.340
and and out the chicken nuggets.
What might sound like,
like that's whatever.
No,

496
00:31:19.341 --> 00:31:20.240
that's a real thing.

497
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:25.120
You're cutting gator squares off the coast of Africa for 90 days.
They,

498
00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.460
they don't have a lot of food left and it gets down to,
okay,

499
00:31:28.461 --> 00:31:31.760
what are we going to get worse?
You're out there trying to get jacked by the way.

500
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.450
And if you,
if you don't have fuel,
so yeah,

501
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.160
bro out with those people a little bit.

502
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.230
Everybody why is just like no skin off your back not to.
Yeah.

503
00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.350
And uh,
you know what I mean?
Really that's what Karma is,
right?
Yeah.

504
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.940
Good to people.
And then it comes back to you.
Yeah.
And so,

505
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.210
so you guys did some shit boardings and,

506
00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.030
but then the Gulf war happened.

507
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.220
He was over in 72 hours when the done really quick.

508
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.390
And the guys in the teams that did do missions,
they,

509
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.530
they were generally like a couple of guys.
There's a couple tunes that got,

510
00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.830
it was a couple of tunes.
There's a platoon that almost got over random,

511
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:13.490
didn't get over coffee.
Right.
That was one platoon.
Um,
no.
Was it,

512
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.910
I think it was a team one platoon,
but was it a no,

513
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.360
it wasn't what it was,
but it was right up there lying and they punched through.

514
00:32:20.361 --> 00:32:22.910
It was pretty crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's like one of the,

515
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.870
and one of the guys that was in that platoon I ended up in a platoon with later.

516
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.150
But generally,

517
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:33.440
and even even doing shit boardings back then was like,
yes,
you know,

518
00:32:33.441 --> 00:32:37.850
we did something real world,
real world,
real world up,
everybody gather around.

519
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.270
And that was the truth.
That was the truth.
That was,
that was the way it was.
Hey,

520
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.070
if you did something real,
that was awesome.
And,
and I mean when I was coming in,

521
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.920
I had all these fantasies that once I was in the seal teams,
look,

522
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.160
there's clandestine wars going on worldwide and I'm going to be all up in them.

523
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.500
I'm going to be fighting wars people don't even know about.

524
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.090
And then I found out when I got to the teams that there was no wars in Guam,

525
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.960
which was where my first deployment went to.
Yeah.

526
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:13.370
I felt like that same thing was going on that there'd be like guys with,

527
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.820
you'd get there and within a week people do on a,
load your stuff up,

528
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:21.821
we're going here and load and everything out and then it doesn't happen that way

529
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:26.240
or it does.
You just got to,
you can't chase it,
I guess.
Well,
it happens more now.

530
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.910
I mean,
now there's a lot more stuff going on.

531
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.630
Edit is going on and it is worldwide and you see it in the news and sometimes

532
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:37.610
you don't.
But it is totally different.
It's completely different now.
I mean,

533
00:33:37.611 --> 00:33:39.590
we are at war.

534
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.950
And so those little fantasies that you have about going into countries though,

535
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.980
that that happens now,
whereas in the 90s wasn't happening.
No.

536
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.120
And then there are all these assumptions about what you're going to do when

537
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:56.240
you're shot at.
I remember like we shifted our,

538
00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:59.660
our immediate action drills around,
um,

539
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:03.920
at an island right after the Panama thing happened,

540
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:08.330
um,
that Patea airstrip.
And they,
and we decided that,

541
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.500
or it was decided by guys thinking about it.
They're like,
hey,
you're just when,

542
00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:15.710
uh,
when the first gunshot goes,
you're just going to crawl.

543
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:20.460
So we did everything crawling around in the desert and uh,

544
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.160
you know,
it's not,
it's not how it goes,
but no one knew.
No one knew.

545
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.930
And we lacked simunition or,

546
00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.390
or laser systems that we ended up using.
And so it was hard to know.

547
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:35.330
I mean even CQC was,
oh specially,

548
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.370
totally ridiculous what we used to do.
And you know,

549
00:34:40.371 --> 00:34:41.480
new guys like me,

550
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.730
they're telling me that this is what you do and this is why you do it.

551
00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:47.960
Cause they have theories behind it.
They have theories theoretically.

552
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.440
And the theories are hard to argue with a because you don't know any better.

553
00:34:51.441 --> 00:34:51.711
And B,

554
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:55.790
because they've kind of pressure tested the theories in little arguments amongst

555
00:34:55.791 --> 00:35:00.140
themselves.
So Hey,
you listen to them and you take,
okay this is the way it is.

556
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.770
And then you find out,
well then everyone found out actually,

557
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:07.430
even just when they started implementing paintballing simunition it was like,

558
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:10.040
you know what,
this doesn't seem like a smart idea.

559
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.280
It doesn't seem like a smart idea for all of us to be standing in the hallway.

560
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.520
That's the,
that's one of the big ones.
It's so obvious.
You know,

561
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.750
my first platoon it was like,

562
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.480
hey everyone standing in the hallway and you get ready to go in the next room

563
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.830
and that's cool.
Then second platoon,
same way.
It wasn't till either,

564
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:28.190
like I think it was even passed.
I think it was,
I think it was in,
um,

565
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.970
I don't know,
I'm trying to think of the year,

566
00:35:31.971 --> 00:35:36.800
but like 98 is when I started seeing a change in,

567
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.500
hey,
this is not smart because watch what happens.

568
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:43.110
You guys are all line up in the hallway.
Cool.
Somebody sticks,

569
00:35:43.111 --> 00:35:48.111
a simunition gone around the corner of the hallway and Mo's down eight people.

570
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.170
Right.
And the first reaction is like,
well that wouldn't happen.
It just happened.

571
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.950
It just happened.
Well that guy wasn't aiming.
Yeah,
you don't need to aim,

572
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.780
you have an automatic weapon.
And so that was kind of the beginning or that,

573
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.540
that definitely had an impact on the way stuff is going to be.

574
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.760
And it's just like you said,
like you talked about in Panama,

575
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:10.470
those guys and how the guy's made theoretical changes,

576
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.910
which is,
hey,
when the shooting starts,
you're going to crawl well in the desert.

577
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.830
Your contact is likely to be much further away and you have much greater

578
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:24.030
distance to travel in order to break contact or to assault.
So if,

579
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.100
if what you're doing is called not saying,

580
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:29.400
there's no times where you will be sucking mud,
cause you certainly can be,

581
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.070
but there's a difference between effective fire and ineffective fire and there's

582
00:36:32.071 --> 00:36:36.180
this difference between dead space and when you're in an open space where you

583
00:36:36.181 --> 00:36:40.530
can actually get hit.
So yeah,
it's weird.

584
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.830
It was awesome and weird to see all that unfold.

585
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.860
And it is actually very similar to what the UFC did do martial arts,

586
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:55.440
you know,
because because everything was theoretical.
And again,
it was,

587
00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.120
you remember some of the kind of weird martial arts that they'd throw at us and

588
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:03.870
the teams and I remember one in particular where it was,
hey,

589
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:07.380
when you hit the guy here,
his,

590
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.680
I forget what they called it,
they had a scientific name for it,

591
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:15.690
his automatic reaction,
but they had some scientific sounding word.

592
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.900
His automatic reaction is physiological reaction is going to be to do this and

593
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:27.450
then when they do that you can do this and then when and when you do this it's

594
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:30.600
going to cause him to that and they had these big scenarios that would,

595
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:34.930
they would play out and that was what it was.
Hey,
when you get it from there,

596
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.560
like it was literally when you hit the guy in the neck,

597
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.720
it's going to cause him to like fold to one side and,
and,

598
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.340
and everyone that gets hit in the neck arches,
they're back in,

599
00:37:45.341 --> 00:37:48.560
sticks their chin out,
then you'll hit him with this.
It was there,

600
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.310
there that that's what they're saying.
And then you can't say,
well,
hey man,

601
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:55.140
go ahead and like hit me in the neck with all your mind.

602
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:59.220
And I actually did do that.
I actually did say like,
hit me,
see if that happens.

603
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:00.054
And it didn't happen.

604
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.170
And then I got some other weird psychobabble circular argument about,

605
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.100
well that's because you're expecting it.
Well,
okay,
but do it when I'm not expert.

606
00:38:09.101 --> 00:38:12.450
You know,
it just,
it's just one of these things.
Strike the,
stomp the groin,

607
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:14.770
rake the eyes,
restart the groin.

608
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.980
What was that?
It was the,

609
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.120
was it the scars was like a soft combat assault system or something like that.

610
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.970
It was,
and we got,
we went through a whole bunch of those.

611
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.690
And all it takes is a couple of people in a leadership position to get convinced

612
00:38:30.691 --> 00:38:32.370
by this [inaudible].

613
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:37.510
I notice I always saw a lot of circular arguments in those things and it's so

614
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:39.970
that,
that thing,
so when the UFC started,
it was like,
oh,

615
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.490
these Kung Fu guys or whatever,
these karate guys or whatever,

616
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:49.420
these Ninjitsu guys or whatever,
whatever their martial art was.

617
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:53.170
And they had the thing that,
oh,
when I drove punch you,

618
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.700
you're breathing will be incapacitated for approximately 45 seconds.

619
00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.490
It's generally about 45 seconds.
When you hit someone in the throat,

620
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.350
in order for the nucleus,
about a 45 seconds,

621
00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:06.340
you've got about a 45 second window where now you want to attack the nerve
basis,

622
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.790
you want to attack the solar plexus when you get them in the solar plexus

623
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:14.320
profitably.
Now you've got about another 45 seconds this week and rake the eyes

624
00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:21.760
I'm doing some grand master can stick that.
That was it man.
And,

625
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.740
and so when the UFC came around it was like,

626
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.510
oh all of a sudden that doesn't work.

627
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.880
And it's the same thing that happened pre and I'll even say priests,
ammunition,

628
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:34.160
pre paint ball and pre and we use miles gear.
But miles gay was kind of weak.

629
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.780
Miles get wasn't quite good enough,
which is for those of you don't know,

630
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:40.150
it's like a laser tag system that you mounted on your wheel weapons.

631
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:43.060
But it wasn't very accurate.

632
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:46.480
You had to deal with jams in your blanks and it was just,
it wasn't that good.

633
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:51.640
Yeah.
But those things definitely started to make it lean towards,
oh,
this,
this,

634
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.940
this theory doesn't seem to hold the water that we all thought that had held.

635
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:02.530
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was just,
but you know what,

636
00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:05.110
here's the thing.
Even if we were crawling,

637
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:07.150
as long as we had a plan and rehearsed it,

638
00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:11.320
that was way better than stuff that wasn't.

639
00:40:11.321 --> 00:40:15.850
So a lot of those guys that did that first,
those first fighting systems,

640
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:19.060
that there was a lot of goofy stuff when they would get in a street fight,

641
00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:21.220
they would still do okay.

642
00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:25.720
Because what's I think patents said that thing about a good plan now is better

643
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:28.270
than a perfect plan later.
You know?
And that's a good point.

644
00:40:28.271 --> 00:40:30.520
Now that I think about it,
if you think about the tactics,

645
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:35.550
so you got told after Panama to crawl and that seems kind of crazy right now.

646
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.380
And in a,
if you think about it as a broad,
hey,

647
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:41.020
what we're gonna do is call the whole time to think about this though.

648
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.670
Remember when it was a whole squad getting up online and moving,

649
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:48.910
get them getting up and running all at one time.
Yeah.
Just as ridiculous.

650
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:52.630
Just ridiculous.
Exactly.
And there's a time and place for both things.

651
00:40:52.631 --> 00:40:55.430
There's a time and place for both things.
And you know,
as mentoring,
I was,

652
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.680
I was at uh,
one of the teams,
I don't know,
six months ago,

653
00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:02.350
a year ago when we were talking tactics and a guy asked me like,
hey,

654
00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:06.800
where does the argument,
I might have even been your team.
The,

655
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.540
the question was like,
where does the commander go in this situation?

656
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:14.200
And it was like one group was saying they shouldn't be in the rear and the other

657
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:18.190
group is saying,
no,
there should be an the,
it was my team and I was like,
listen,

658
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.130
there's different times where the commander needs to be in a different spot.

659
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:26.290
And where the commander should be is where he isn't in the weeds but still kind

660
00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:29.380
of understands what's happening and can provide the mess,
command and control.

661
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:34.550
So the answer is not he should be here.
The answer is

662
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.840
where should he be for that particular situation?

663
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.030
And does the commander have the understanding,

664
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.060
the tactical understanding and the operational understanding to go,
oh,

665
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:44.894
you know what,

666
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.230
if these guys are busting into a building right here and I go into that building

667
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.640
and there's contact,

668
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.400
I'm going to be sucked into that contract and I'm not gonna be able to control

669
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:54.410
anything contrary to that.

670
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:58.100
If I'm way at the back where the contact happens and I don't even know what

671
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:00.530
building it's in,
that's a problem too.
Where should I be?

672
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.140
I should be where I can provide the best command and control.

673
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.420
And that's very adaptable.
It's very easy to adapt,

674
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.650
but it's very also very easy for people to come up with doctrine and then

675
00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:14.390
supporting arguments,
supporting theories that,

676
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.200
that are very hard to argue against because you get into circular arguments

677
00:42:18.201 --> 00:42:19.160
against crazy people.

678
00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:24.470
<v 2>Yeah.
Ooh,
become emotionally attached to whatever the answer.
Oh,
that's a stinger.</v>

679
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:28.070
And this is why I think NSW is all,

680
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:33.071
has been so successful and I think it'll continue to be successful is because

681
00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.990
we're not so rigid in what we do.

682
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:41.790
And it's so it in in one ways it's a weakness but it's also at the same time our

683
00:42:41.791 --> 00:42:44.820
greatest strength because everything I've done on deployment,

684
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.240
most things actually was not exactly something that I trained for.

685
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:55.820
But the training that I got was 30% there to where it was easy to pivot and boom

686
00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:01.020
in do whatever,
whatever's being requested overseas.
Yeah.

687
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.100
<v 0>And the training that you got trained you to think trains you to think,</v>

688
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.590
not just,
hey,
this is what you're going to do 100% of the time.
It's like,
Hey,

689
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:15.140
this is going to work in this situation,
but you should be looking around.

690
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:17.750
You should have your head on a swivel.
You should be looking for work.

691
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:20.750
All those little,
those little like mantras that you get told,

692
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:26.090
they actually make sense cause it's not just do the same thing every time it's

693
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.940
read and react.
Right.
They didn't react.

694
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.840
That's one of the first things you started hearing like read and react because

695
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:37.070
you don't just do,
you actually read and you actually assess.

696
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.520
So those are all important.
Uh,

697
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:45.290
anything else from that first deployment besides just being on the Oregon?

698
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:46.390
<v 2>You know,
I man,</v>

699
00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.640
hot long 10 month deployment.

700
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.030
I remember it by the end of the deployment.
After that deployment,

701
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.460
none of us wanted to talk to each other for a while.

702
00:43:57.461 --> 00:44:01.180
It was like you'd see guys around the corner,
hey and then,

703
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:05.920
cause it was just so long and there's no internet,
there's no internet,
you know,

704
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:11.190
communication with home is snail mail letters takes three week conversations you

705
00:44:12.461 --> 00:44:13.710
have back and forth and,

706
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:18.370
and the whole platoon is in a room that's twice the size of this.

707
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:20.710
The racks are stacked four high.

708
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.700
<v 0>You've got like 80 movies on videotape and they're just running constantly.</v>

709
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.040
And you've seen every one of these

710
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.480
<v 2>80 movies,
uh,
500 times because they're literally playing nonstop.</v>

711
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:41.050
And the platoon space,
it's ridiculous.
We got on a kick in,

712
00:44:41.051 --> 00:44:45.990
this is another arg deployment I went on later when I'm going to Somalia,

713
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.000
but we got on a kick with uh,

714
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.280
<v 3>oh,</v>

715
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.160
<v 2>what's the movie where the girls had spins around and exercise.</v>

716
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:59.630
So we're watching the exorcist over and over and over again and write about,

717
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.950
that was the time we did the,
uh,

718
00:45:02.951 --> 00:45:05.320
the shell back ceremony where we went over the equator.

719
00:45:05.321 --> 00:45:07.930
And so there was only two guys in the platoon that had done it.

720
00:45:07.931 --> 00:45:11.720
So all the rest of us were blogs and we were going through it.
And,
uh,

721
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:16.000
basically all they do is throw food at humans,
brand new with water,
which,

722
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:20.500
okay,
is it like buds?
We were just doing it and guys would come by with like,

723
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.790
oh look at these walks over here.
And I remember one of the guys going thought,

724
00:45:24.791 --> 00:45:29.320
power of Christ compels the power of Christ,

725
00:45:29.321 --> 00:45:30.310
compels you.

726
00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:35.230
And then we all started shouting in and the guy just looked at us for a second

727
00:45:35.231 --> 00:45:37.870
and wandered off and someone else came behind with a hose and spray just a

728
00:45:37.871 --> 00:45:40.420
little bit,
but they had no idea what to make of us at all.

729
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:47.830
Uh,
awesome.
Uh,
you come home from that deployment and then what?
Then what's up?

730
00:45:47.831 --> 00:45:48.664
What's next?

731
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:52.090
Then I went and worked in the armory for a little bit and waited to pick up

732
00:45:52.091 --> 00:45:55.720
another,
another platoon den.
After that I did

733
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.220
worked in your armory for another six months,
did another platoon.

734
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.770
And then that was a Spec.

735
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.520
You went to the armory because you were interested in,

736
00:46:06.521 --> 00:46:10.050
was it gunner's mate and so I was a ordinance.
What,

737
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.540
what position were you and your first platoon?
Oh,
good point.

738
00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:18.530
So I was a sniper,
but they didn't,
we didn't have NSW,

739
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:19.720
you didn't have a sniper course.

740
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:24.750
So there was a guy that had just come from reappointment point man and second

741
00:46:25.271 --> 00:46:25.960
squad.

742
00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.740
And the first squad point man was a sniper and he'd been to the army sniper

743
00:46:29.741 --> 00:46:31.780
school.
So they ran,

744
00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:35.740
ran me through some different training and stuff like that to get me like kind

745
00:46:35.741 --> 00:46:40.060
of qualified,
but I didn't have a certificate or nothing.
And it was really,

746
00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:44.580
um,
minor stuff.
So me and the other sniper would,
you know,

747
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.800
practice just calling stuff out.
And then when we do the tech of boardings,

748
00:46:47.801 --> 00:46:52.780
I'd be up in the Hilo eyes above passing info.
And,

749
00:46:52.781 --> 00:46:57.310
uh,
so when I got back,
I went to,
um,

750
00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.570
I was working in ordinance and then I got an opportunity to go to the second NSW

751
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:06.370
sniper course they ran on the west coast.
And,
uh,
that was,

752
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.860
that was brutal.
Um,

753
00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.940
I've never failed anything.
Up until then,

754
00:47:13.941 --> 00:47:17.540
I'd never failed anything in my life and I didn't make it through the first

755
00:47:17.541 --> 00:47:22.400
sniper course.
I passed the shooting portion,
which most guys pass,
but,
uh,

756
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.010
and that was like five weeks straight of shooting.

757
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:30.000
But then when it came to stalking,
I just didn't get it.
And,
uh,

758
00:47:30.001 --> 00:47:33.460
a lack,
the patience that I needed that I later figured it out.

759
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.570
And so I didn't pass.
I came out of there without,
not a sniper call,

760
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:41.680
but an advanced marksman qual,
um,
badge of dishonor.

761
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:46.000
Yeah,
pretty much.
And uh,
guys,

762
00:47:46.001 --> 00:47:49.300
so actually it's funny because I say that jokingly,

763
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:54.330
but like everybody knows that how hard that they used to fail everyone in stock.

764
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.750
And it was crazy.
Mike my course,

765
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:03.751
there's only two guys that graduated with a call with a sniper quoll out of

766
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:08.650
like,
how much are the animals?
How much of that was the seal instructor,

767
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:11.440
Bro team guys going,
we're going to have the hardest course ever.

768
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:13.830
No one's going to make it through.
It's going to be the toughest course.
I right.

769
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.780
I don't,
yeah,
I mean,
I mean if I would've been in that position,

770
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.780
I think there was,

771
00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:21.610
there was definitely a piece of that because there was like some guys getting

772
00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:24.420
pretty Dang excited and screaming and yell at you every yard line and you're

773
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:27.700
like,
good grief,
what's going on?
And uh,
um,

774
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.870
but I don't know if that would have made a difference for me passing or not.

775
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.610
Like had it been more leveled out and they hadn't gotten too excited about it,

776
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.960
which I'm not saying they did,
but that's just,
that's how it rolled out.

777
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:44.730
So second and I,

778
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.890
I platooned up and I was again,
a point man.

779
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.170
And then I think I acted as a sniper,

780
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:53.890
but then the sniper thing kind of fell off the radar for NSW a little bit.

781
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:56.980
It wasn't a priority for anybody.
And,
uh,

782
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.440
did a second platoon,
which is a spec ops platoon went to the Philippines or no,

783
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:07.200
we went to Guam.
That's where we met at the jungle in Guam.
And,

784
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:10.330
and the jungle was his bar,
the judge,
everybody in jungle.

785
00:49:10.331 --> 00:49:14.920
The jungle was the bar that everybody went to.
And then,
uh,

786
00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:20.710
yeah,
did that platoon,
then I wound up doing a year overseas.
Well,

787
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.400
I went home for a week and then came back with another platoon straightaway and

788
00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:28.480
did,
did that.
And those were great experiences.
I mean,
we traveled around a lot.

789
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:33.820
Um,
we did a lot of water work back in the day,
a lot of tank tanker boarding,

790
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:38.500
a lot of diving,
all,
all that,
didn't do anything real.

791
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.610
And then when I came back from those deployments,

792
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:47.170
I went to work in,
uh,
our training cell at the team.

793
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.883
Um,

794
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:54.010
and the guy I was working in the land warfare section working for a guy named,

795
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:57.880
uh,
Danny Carol,
who at the time was,
uh,

796
00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:02.920
and I'm gonna have to back up a little bit on this,
but,
uh,
he,
he was just,

797
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.900
he was awesome to work for.
He's,

798
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.890
he's one of these guys that no matter how bad anything ever was,

799
00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:10.180
he never complained.

800
00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:14.200
He might complain to someone that was his peer,

801
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:18.460
but he never complained down and then never complained about,
oh,

802
00:50:18.461 --> 00:50:21.340
this is stupid.
Or he was not the tortured genius,

803
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:25.780
which when things were hard and he wasn't complaining,
then it wasn't hard.

804
00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:30.770
And He,
he's another guy with a really good sense of humor,
um,

805
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.210
and uh,
and just a good,
good time to be around.

806
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:39.200
But the biggest thing about him was just like never,
ever complained.

807
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:44.180
Always something positive to say.
Um,
and,
and was,
was an expert.

808
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:48.830
And then when he did give you a critique,
he didn't,

809
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:50.210
it wasn't condescending.

810
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.900
So he was somebody I looked up to when he wasn't in my platoon and he's actually

811
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:55.460
a leadership and my sister platoon.

812
00:50:55.461 --> 00:50:57.230
And I would go over and talk to him all the time.

813
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:01.640
And like back in the day I had my hair bleached white.
It was always long.

814
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:02.361
You know,

815
00:51:02.361 --> 00:51:07.310
I was never in the right uniform ever because not being in uniform made me feel

816
00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:11.510
special because I was insecure and uh,
all,

817
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:15.050
all people would just scream at me,
cut your hair,
get in uniform.

818
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:19.370
But they never would tell you,
you know,
hey,
do it.
Then one day Danny goes,

819
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:23.390
Hey Jason,
why don't you,
why don't you cut your hair?

820
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:28.760
It's so easy to have a decent haircut and be in the right uniform and your life

821
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:33.140
is going to be so much better and you should just try it for a little bit.

822
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:37.820
And he just laid it out and it,
there was no condescension behind.

823
00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:42.740
It was just straight up advice from one friend to another.
And uh,
um,

824
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.710
and so I tried it and I was like,
hey,
this is amazing.

825
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.840
People aren't asking like,
Hey,
what are you doing tonight?

826
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:55.310
People were actually giving me stuff to do and then leaving me alone and let me

827
00:51:55.311 --> 00:51:59.300
do it cause they,
they trusted me that I was going to be,
you know,

828
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:04.280
be professional about it.
And after and working for him,

829
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.510
I got the opportunity because when the teams ran sniper courses,

830
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:12.560
I got to interject real quick cause there's also those guys that would be like,

831
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.730
they're condescending and all you do is,

832
00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.880
you know the guy that's all straight laced running around the team looking like

833
00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:22.190
a Dork.
And you just think when you're a young team guy,
you're like,

834
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:24.500
this guy's a dork.
He doesn't eat as it.

835
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:28.760
And if they come up and say something and you're just mad at him,
you know,

836
00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:31.280
you're just like,
you're stupid.
You don't get it.

837
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.550
You don't know what it's like to be young Jocko.
Right.

838
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.020
And that's how everybody else was was for me.
Cause you're like,
really?

839
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:43.810
But you know,
Danny was a beast and then so it was like,
yeah,
I'm gonna,

840
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:45.140
I'm gonna listen to what he's saying.
You know,

841
00:52:45.141 --> 00:52:48.770
there's an important two things about Steve Hines and,
and Danny,

842
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.150
which I didn't work with either of those guys other than peripheral peripherally

843
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:54.500
through through the years.
You know,

844
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.150
I think Steve Hines put was that free fall school with WHO's at an island

845
00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:02.270
forever.
So whatever.
And Danny,
Carol,
well I didn't,

846
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:06.470
I remember Danny from being on deployment and hit my Lpo was good friends with

847
00:53:06.471 --> 00:53:09.110
him.
And so,
you know,
we were always linked up and,

848
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:13.790
but what I was going to say is,
you mentioned this real quick,

849
00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.570
he was good operator.
Like he was Oh guys that,

850
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.930
cause if you were good at your job,

851
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:26.190
that's like the base level of having respect in getting people

852
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.890
<v 0>to listen to you is oh this guy is a really good at his job.</v>

853
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:31.170
And you'd even here before we,

854
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.680
before the word operator had the,

855
00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:39.810
had the kind of meaning that it has day where it's like,
oh he's an operator.

856
00:53:39.811 --> 00:53:43.080
And it kind of is this taken on a life of its own,
but back then and be like,

857
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:44.610
oh yeah,
that guy's a good operator.

858
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.900
And it really meant something when I would hear that about someone like,
Hey,

859
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:52.200
that guy's a really good operator,
and you think,
oh,
wow,
that guys,

860
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:54.540
that means he can shoot.
Well that means you can navigate well.

861
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:57.420
That means he can dive well.
That means he's,
he's,
uh,

862
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:01.200
keeps his cool like meant to all of those things.
That guy's a good operator.

863
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:05.670
And so that sort of to me was the baseline.
And especially for guys that I

864
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.800
looked up to at my team when I was a new guy,
it was the guys where you'd hear,

865
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:13.620
oh,
that guy's a really good operator.
And then it was okay.

866
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.880
And it wasn't like that was everyone.
It was not a big number of people.
And,

867
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:22.200
and to develop a reputation as a good operator when there's no war going on,

868
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:27.180
it's actually very hard to do that because what that means is every one of these

869
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:29.340
stupid training missions,

870
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:32.400
every one of these dumb dives that everyone's bitching about,

871
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:35.610
you're actually taking completely serious and you're doing your best and you're

872
00:54:35.611 --> 00:54:38.550
teaching other people.
And that is what,

873
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:42.390
that's what developed the reputation back then was like this guy's a good

874
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:43.493
operator.

875
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:47.450
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah,
definitely.
And so then,</v>

876
00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.560
then that guys I have to kind of Wasta where he can hand out advice and then the

877
00:54:51.561 --> 00:54:56.150
fact that he gives it out without being condescending or,
or straight up.

878
00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:58.760
It's just so much.
It's,
it's worth absorbing.

879
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.670
<v 0>What about,
did you,
so what are the schools,
did you go to,
did you get any,</v>

880
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.020
what about,
did you go to sere school?

881
00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.960
<v 2>Yeah.
How was that good time?
You know,
that that was,</v>

882
00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:12.110
uh,
was it,
I forget when,

883
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:15.200
I think it was in this period after I did those two platoons that I finally got

884
00:55:15.201 --> 00:55:18.380
sucked into going to see your school.
And uh,

885
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.670
I remember I didn't get waterboarded for some reason in sere school,

886
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:27.380
but I did kill Anita rattlesnake and they're like,
hey,

887
00:55:27.381 --> 00:55:32.060
you're not supposed to do that.
And then I got caught and then I'm like,
okay,

888
00:55:32.061 --> 00:55:35.750
well,
but this is just in the field training portion where you know,

889
00:55:35.751 --> 00:55:40.190
you're doing patrolling and,
uh,
um,

890
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:42.770
danger crossings.
That's all you're doing all day.

891
00:55:42.771 --> 00:55:45.050
And then you'd have these little land Nav exercises you're doing,

892
00:55:45.051 --> 00:55:47.600
which were super easy for me cause this is what we did.

893
00:55:47.601 --> 00:55:51.800
So I would just just get them done and be done sleeping and hungry and tried to

894
00:55:51.801 --> 00:55:56.060
eat grasshoppers and everything cause they don't feed you for the whole week.
Uh,

895
00:55:56.510 --> 00:56:01.430
and then when they catch you and they put you into that,
that prison camp.

896
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:05.000
So the first thing they do is have everybody line up and then they strip you

897
00:56:05.001 --> 00:56:08.580
down naked.
Cause apparently there they're checking you for ticks.
Yeah,

898
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:09.231
that makes sense.

899
00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:13.940
So then they see all my tattoos and one of the instructors is like,

900
00:56:13.941 --> 00:56:17.320
hey,
this guy's got the mark of the devil because the guys all have that Russian

901
00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.030
accent,
right?
Yeah.
So I get,

902
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:25.510
I get grabbed and then I'm the circle of these instructors and they're like,

903
00:56:25.601 --> 00:56:28.450
he's got the market a devil and they're kind of shoving me back and forth.

904
00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:33.370
And I'm like,
Oh okay this is kind of fun.
This is,
you know,
this isn't a big deal.

905
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.150
And then a guy that straight across from me,

906
00:56:37.151 --> 00:56:42.151
I can remember seeing a big black hand come over his shoulder and it like covers

907
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:47.350
up half of his chest,
like,
like Andre the giant big and just move the dude away.

908
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.500
And then another guy,
a hand moves the other guy away.

909
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:55.740
And then there's this just mountain of a man grabbed me with his left hand,

910
00:56:56.290 --> 00:57:00.670
picks me up.
The only allowed to like hit you from out here to here.

911
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:02.920
But it was like,

912
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.940
you know those those images in rocky where it was like to cook all

913
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.740
stars and not just,
Oh,

914
00:57:11.741 --> 00:57:15.520
that was that little smirk I just had on my face laying on the ground over there

915
00:57:15.521 --> 00:57:19.360
and oh,
here comes again.
Uhm,
and uh,
humbling.

916
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.980
<v 0>I,
I literally got the exact same treatment.</v>

917
00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:27.630
I remember I was in some vehicle and it was after you got,

918
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.960
you avoided capture and then eventually they just call up in the woods and they

919
00:57:30.961 --> 00:57:33.320
go,
come down and you have to surrender now.
Yeah.
So we had avoided,

920
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.300
captured me and my pilot buddy,
wait,
avoid capture.

921
00:57:36.301 --> 00:57:40.110
We go down and get in the vehicle.
They drive us somewhere and I'm just,
you know,

922
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:44.190
everything's a joke or whatever and get out of the vehicle and you know,

923
00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:48.570
some guys yelling at us with the fake Russian accent and I'm just laughing at it

924
00:57:48.571 --> 00:57:51.900
inside in,
which means,
you know,
I'm like kind of probably got that.

925
00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:56.130
I was 19.
Yeah.
And the dude,

926
00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:00.180
the dude comes over and he like yells at me and I,
I,
you know,

927
00:58:00.181 --> 00:58:05.181
who knows what I said to prove that I was a tough guy and this dude cracks me.

928
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:11.910
And I was like,
Eh.
I was like,
I can't believe he just did that.

929
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:15.660
And okay,
well good times.
So that must be,
they must,

930
00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:19.920
they must know who we are coming in.
They must look at the young punks and go,

931
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:22.290
Yup,
I got this guy.
Hey I got,

932
00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:25.980
what number is Gardner coming over here from seal team?

933
00:58:25.981 --> 00:58:29.340
Five numbers of willing coming over here from seal team one,

934
00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:30.440
I'm going to get me some money

935
00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.020
<v 2>and it's gonna give them just an immense amount of satisfaction when that look</v>

936
00:58:36.021 --> 00:58:37.100
gets knocked off your face.

937
00:58:37.101 --> 00:58:40.220
Cause they could just see the light come out of your eyes and you're like,
oh

938
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:44.300
<v 0>it's a car.
I mean I've been punched many times.</v>

939
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:48.800
That open hand smack full on and I don't know what you're talking about.

940
00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:50.300
Only bringing it back to wherever.

941
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:53.960
This brother brought it back all the way and brought it all the way home too.

942
00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:56.840
It was a good one.
And I've been,
like I said,
I've been hit before.

943
00:58:56.841 --> 00:58:59.060
I've been knocked out before.
It didn't knock me out but it was a,

944
00:58:59.061 --> 00:59:00.020
it was definitely a,

945
00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:04.670
it was definitely a reality of Oh yeah these guys or these guys are not playing

946
00:59:04.671 --> 00:59:05.240
around.

947
00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.270
These guys are going to take pleasure in beating the crap out of me and they're

948
00:59:08.271 --> 00:59:11.270
going to do it if they,
if I give them any reason to.

949
00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:16.370
So in which that,
so that was two deployments,
you come back,
you're in training.

950
00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:18.830
How much did you learn when you were working in training?

951
00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:22.160
Because I know I as an e five in seal team,

952
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:27.160
<v 2>one training cell learned like just mountains of information.</v>

953
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:30.020
Tons.
Yeah,
exactly.
Cause that's when,

954
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:33.410
when you have to teach something is when you got to really absorb it because you

955
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:35.480
have to completely understand it and everything else.

956
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:39.260
So that's when it opened up the curtain for me.

957
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:44.510
So I saw everything that went into training that was behind the scenes,

958
00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:46.640
you know,
when you go through the training like Oh,
okay,

959
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:50.930
well there's a lot that goes on from laying on the ranges to doing the med

960
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:51.351
drills,

961
00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:56.351
to ordering the Ammo to try to make the training relevant and realistic for the

962
00:59:57.351 --> 01:00:01.790
guy.
So it's,
you just don't feel like you're wasting their time.
But uh,

963
01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:05.540
yeah.
And then it was at that,
at that time that uh,

964
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:10.630
I went back and restocked and got my sniper quoll and then was an instructor for

965
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.910
a couple of different sniper courses.
Um,
it's got period the differences.

966
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.700
What you,

967
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.580
was there something that you said you didn't get it in the stock in the first

968
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:23.360
time around?

969
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.010
Was it like you didn't quite figure out dead space was it,

970
01:00:28.011 --> 01:00:31.970
you just didn't have the patience for it where you like whatever on what,
what,

971
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:34.970
what did you,
what changed about you?
What did you learn in between those two?

972
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:36.043
I uh,

973
01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:40.940
so they drop you off and then they'll just point,
hey,

974
01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.470
the observation point is that way.
And during a stock you're uh,

975
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:51.130
you're trying to find where these other guys are at and,

976
01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.210
and you don't know.
And there other their sniper instructor,
so they have really,

977
01:00:56.211 --> 01:01:00.740
really good skills and optics and they're sitting out somewhere they shouldn't,

978
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:05.120
not totally concealed,
but you've got to,
you've got to find them before you move.

979
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.690
And the mistake I was making before is that getting impatient and I'm just like,

980
01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.580
oh,
I'll just start going that way.

981
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:15.730
And along the way I'll figure out where they're at and as opposed to,

982
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:17.061
okay,

983
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:22.061
I'm going to just sit right here and take my time and figure out where

984
01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:28.400
everything is and how everything is laid out and then try and find the o p

985
01:01:28.401 --> 01:01:32.810
before I move down toward it at all.
You'd have to,

986
01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:35.300
I'd have to move latterly one way or the other to figure it out.

987
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.920
And so typically on the stocks,
when it clicked for me,

988
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:44.950
I would be the last guy to leak to actually leave where they'd drop us off and

989
01:01:45.561 --> 01:01:46.820
I'd be the first guy done.

990
01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:52.180
And typically I'd spend almost no time crawling because I would do,

991
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:56.660
do the,
you know,
find the EOP.
Once I had it located,

992
01:01:56.661 --> 01:02:00.710
then I would study their terrain really hard and figured out where I needed to

993
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:05.090
go to get within that 200 yards to do your,
you know,
final shots,

994
01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:08.270
you figure this out on your own.
Will they tell you that?

995
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.340
But I just started listening to him and,
and,
and it clicked.

996
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:16.730
They're like,
hey,
you gotta find the oop.
Okay.

997
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.010
Cause Yeah,
isn't

998
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.820
<v 0>that strange?
I mean,
well your kids,
while you got kids that are old enough,</v>

999
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:27.810
like it's the same thing with your kids.
You tell them like,
hey,

1000
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:31.290
figure out where the [inaudible] is before you start crawling or whatever.

1001
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:34.290
It is less life lesson that you learned about getting hit in the head with a

1002
01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:35.124
baseball bat.

1003
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.960
And you try and give your kids a hint or just tell them and they're just like,

1004
01:02:39.961 --> 01:02:42.930
no,
I'm just going to start moving.
Yeah,
I got this

1005
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.590
and I have no idea how to deal with that.

1006
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.330
It's funny because I think you and I have met a lot of the same experiences
with,

1007
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:53.730
with dealing with our kids and you're like,
Hey,
I'm telling you,

1008
01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:57.330
I've lived through this.
Here's what you should do.

1009
01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.650
And,
but now I've come to the point where I'm still going to tell him,

1010
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:05.200
but I know what they're probably going to do.
And then,
yeah.

1011
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:09.090
And then just wait and see.
Keep your fingers crossed,

1012
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:14.070
I guess is what people say.
Okay.
So what I noticed,

1013
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:17.970
one of the things that I,
I'm,
I'm actually thinking about this right now.

1014
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:21.020
When I was in training cell and I was,

1015
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:24.480
because I was single and didn't care about anything else.

1016
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.240
And so I taught everything.
It was like,
oh,

1017
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.630
there's land warfare trip and goatees land warfare.
Oh,
there's a CQC trip.

1018
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.400
Go teach that.
Go teach combat swimmer.

1019
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.940
Just teach everything because cause and now I look back how awesome it must be

1020
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:42.720
when you got guys like that at the team who are just like,
oh yeah,

1021
01:03:42.721 --> 01:03:45.450
I don't mind going down another month long trip back to back,
doesn't matter.

1022
01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:47.970
We'll go train.
And it wasn't just me that was doing,
it's like all my,

1023
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.080
all my Bros it,
you know,

1024
01:03:49.081 --> 01:03:51.540
I was friends with all my guys from team and we're all saying that like,
hey,

1025
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:53.700
we'll go teach whatever you said it was on the road.
We don't care.

1026
01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:54.690
It was awesome.

1027
01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:59.690
I had a Volkswagen van that I'd taken all the seats out of the back end,

1028
01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:01.470
just line of the carpet and I had some,

1029
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.580
some bean bags in there and when I was on the strand I slept in the parking lot

1030
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.880
for like I think eight months because I was like,

1031
01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:12.420
I would rather be on a trip cla collecting per diem and doing stuff.

1032
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:16.980
Then sitting here and so that's,
that's where,
that's where I want this.

1033
01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:21.570
It was always out on training block.
I was running an SQT,
I wasn't running it,

1034
01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:26.280
but I was one of the instructors on an Stt when we used to run Stt at the team.

1035
01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:28.440
So it was a bunch of new guys.
We were putting them through training.

1036
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:32.520
And I remember right now I'm remembering this,

1037
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.710
there was like multiple officers in the same STT class.

1038
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:41.700
So each squad had multiple officers.
So we were rotating through like,
okay,

1039
01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:44.490
it's your turn B squad leader to your team during I ads.

1040
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:46.830
And now that I think about it,

1041
01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:51.140
I remember so much of looking at like,
okay,

1042
01:04:51.141 --> 01:04:53.550
he'd see one guy do it and he'd be all screwed up and he'd say,

1043
01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:54.780
what is wrong with this guy?
Oh,

1044
01:04:54.781 --> 01:04:57.120
he's shooting the whole time instead of looking around.

1045
01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:02.510
And then just from one iteration and the big differences when you're not doing

1046
01:05:02.671 --> 01:05:06.720
the I add when you're actually watching it unfold,
everything becomes,
so we,

1047
01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.930
this is like when I talk about detaching your,

1048
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.010
this is my earliest or some of my earlier experiences of being detached as

1049
01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:17.830
you're watching these immediate action drills unfold.

1050
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:23.250
<v 2>And I remember one officer that was all jacked up and I watched him like,</v>

1051
01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:27.280
why is it,
why can't this squad do a whatever?

1052
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:32.020
Why can't this squad do a,
uh,
a strong left or whatever or appeal,
right?

1053
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:33.700
Why can't they do it?
What is wrong?

1054
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.640
So I'm watching this one officer and the other officer like,
well,

1055
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:38.530
this officer did it fine.
I watched him,

1056
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.470
the contact happens and that people start shooting.

1057
01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:44.200
And then the guy looks around and mixed call.
I watched this other officer,

1058
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:45.400
the contact happens,

1059
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:48.130
he starts shooting and he doesn't stop shooting and no one's making the call.

1060
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.120
And it was just as simple as like,
hey man,
your job is not to shoot.

1061
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:57.250
Your job is to make me look around and make a call that you learned so much when

1062
01:05:57.251 --> 01:05:58.090
you're instructing,

1063
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:03.210
not only because you have to think about what you say and you have to be able to

1064
01:06:04.031 --> 01:06:08.020
articulate why.
And that makes you dig deep into the reason why.

1065
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:12.970
And then you get to detach and actually watch it unfold and watch these little

1066
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:15.130
minor mistakes happen.
And then you get to correct them.

1067
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:18.430
And then you get to recognize them in yourself when you make them.

1068
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.080
It's a powerful thing too.
And I,
when I was at trade it,

1069
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.540
I think we did a good job of transfer cause no one had,
you know,

1070
01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.430
it used to be [inaudible] to go to trading.
I don't want to go to training.

1071
01:06:30.431 --> 01:06:31.330
I don't want to go to trade it.

1072
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:35.200
I think we did a good job of transferring the mentality to,
hey,

1073
01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:39.820
if you want to get good at this job,
you got to come here.
You got to.

1074
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:45.130
Yeah.
Which I believe is the truth.
So anyone,

1075
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.670
if you want to get good at something,
just try and teach it.

1076
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.210
Same thing with Jujitsu as well.
The uh,
um,

1077
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.750
that was an sop for us when,

1078
01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.520
when I was in land warfare at five was when the guy was having a hard time.

1079
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:03.250
We'd pull them up.
There's like,
hey,
come stand next to me,

1080
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:06.830
the RSO and just watch your guys 80% of the time.
That would,

1081
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:10.180
that would all fix the problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1082
01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.480
Which is a testament to just attachment.
Yeah,
it is.

1083
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:18.220
It is a testament to detachment in man.
Once you learn how to detach,

1084
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.840
even though you're in the situation,
it's like just makes life so much easier.

1085
01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:27.550
So much easier.
Okay,
so now what you do another platoon.

1086
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.710
So I got three platoons under my belt.
I'm working in,
in uh,

1087
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:38.470
in uh,
land warfare or at at trade,
you know,
training self,
the team.

1088
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:43.420
And then one of the platoons that was on the Arg,

1089
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:48.930
they were going to pull into Somalia and help the morale or the UN pullout a

1090
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:54.210
Somalia,
this is [inaudible] 95.
And one of their,

1091
01:07:54.211 --> 01:07:59.211
their sniper in their platoon got thrown in jail and Hong Kong and it was a big

1092
01:07:59.921 --> 01:08:02.380
international incident,
so they were down a sniper.

1093
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:07.950
So I happen to be on quarter deck watch when the OIC of the platoon called back

1094
01:08:08.411 --> 01:08:13.270
to the team and said,
we need another sniper out here.
We're down one.

1095
01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:17.980
And we know we're going to go into Somalia in like three months.
And uh,

1096
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:22.520
I'm like,
Hey,
I'm a sniper anima sniper instructor send me.

1097
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:27.910
So I pass it back to the expo and they're actually a couple,

1098
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.590
there was another guy that was senior to me.

1099
01:08:30.591 --> 01:08:34.010
He was an e six at the time that was going to go.

1100
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:38.120
And then something came up at the last second.
He couldn't go.
So they're like,

1101
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:41.990
hey,
you're going.
So I packed up my stuff.
Um,

1102
01:08:41.991 --> 01:08:45.290
they flew me over to Bahrain,
the,
when the ship pulled in,

1103
01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:49.020
I met up with the platoon and then got in the platoon and uh,

1104
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.500
about six weeks later we wound up in Somalia.

1105
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:56.990
So I just got lucky,
you know,
because you can't,

1106
01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:00.980
you can't chase it.
And then in the 90s,
there was no,

1107
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:02.480
like at that point,

1108
01:09:02.481 --> 01:09:07.481
I think there had been two other platoons that had cycled through Somalia and,

1109
01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:10.910
and both of them had had gotten in troops in contact,

1110
01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:15.510
which was a dream for all of us.
Uh,
and,

1111
01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:17.390
and timing wise,

1112
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:22.280
this is like two years after the Big Black Hawk down thing happened there.

1113
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.630
So gotten that platoon,
um,

1114
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:29.880
another arc platoon back on the same ship that I did in my first argument.

1115
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:34.400
We were in the same burning space.
What ship was it?
The Ogden,

1116
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.990
they'll be d five.
Uh,
and uh,

1117
01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:44.270
but another guy that was really another guy that was a big mentor of mine,

1118
01:09:44.271 --> 01:09:46.280
I looked up to a lot was,
and he was,

1119
01:09:46.281 --> 01:09:51.281
the Lpo is Monte tree size and money had been around as w for a long time.

1120
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:57.170
And he had the additional deal where he'd,
he had broken service.

1121
01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:01.640
So he was a police officer up in Los Angeles.

1122
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:04.160
And,
uh,
he had a lot of,
you know,

1123
01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.760
because those guys where he'd actually been in gunfights before and in high

1124
01:10:07.761 --> 01:10:12.050
stress situations.
So it was,
it was really good having him,

1125
01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:17.060
having them there.
And then when we did go ashore,
myself and the other snipe,

1126
01:10:17.061 --> 01:10:19.610
we split up into two different sniper elements.

1127
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:24.380
And Monte was with my element.
And then the,
uh,
uh,

1128
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.220
the other sniper was with the,
the chief was with him and then they each have,

1129
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:31.970
it's bad like five guys in our group because it was an excuse to get a shore.

1130
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:36.380
And the reason,
and this was completely the marines deal,

1131
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.660
they were there to pull the UN out,

1132
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:43.520
but they didn't have the 50 caliber sniper rifle capability.

1133
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:48.170
And that's something that they wanted to have so that they could reach out these

1134
01:10:48.171 --> 01:10:51.850
long distance and be a little bit more surgical with,
uh,

1135
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:56.220
their application of force,
um,
smarter.
So we wrote,

1136
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.310
our officers were able to sell it and uh,

1137
01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:03.140
and then we got to go ashore doing that.
And that was,
uh,
how many,

1138
01:11:03.141 --> 01:11:05.630
how many days did you spend on the ground,
man?

1139
01:11:05.631 --> 01:11:08.420
We were only in there for like three days.

1140
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:14.070
And so the Marines,
I think we were on the,

1141
01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.300
the second lift to shore and I was down on the airfield,

1142
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.650
but the airfield in the Mogadishu airports right up against the ocean.

1143
01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.670
And,
and it's

1144
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:28.610
<v 0>the reason I say is because before this,</v>

1145
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:32.030
or maybe it was after this,
but I was cutting gator squares,

1146
01:11:32.031 --> 01:11:34.970
which means driving around in circles off the coast of Somalia for,

1147
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:40.040
for a long time.
And we were supposed to go in and we were,
we,
we add,

1148
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:44.750
we got our issue of,
of Ammo,
real ammo,
you know,

1149
01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:49.010
all of our gear,
our ammo,
our mags were loaded.
Um,
are,

1150
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:52.010
I remember I put the real,
um,

1151
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:56.130
40 Mike Mike into my vest for the first time and they didn't quite fit right in,

1152
01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:01.140
like it was a no one and no one had ever done it or no,

1153
01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:06.200
like I didn't know.
And,
and so here we were and we,

1154
01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:09.260
and so we did all kinds of maps.
We were ready to go in and then we,

1155
01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.850
we never went in,
which was,

1156
01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.430
and part of the reason we didn't go in as the same reason we didn't go into

1157
01:12:13.431 --> 01:12:18.270
Rwanda because Black Hawk down had happened and people were just like,
they were,

1158
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:22.850
everyone was super hyper cautious about everything.
And so yeah,

1159
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.110
I remember we were going,
we were actually taking boats into the airfield.

1160
01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:30.470
That's what we're gonna do.
So I remember that of your field being close then.
So,

1161
01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.480
uh,
this is a funny cause you guys flying in helicopters.
Yeah,

1162
01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.700
<v 2>no,
he wrote it on one of the big hovercraft,
the elk act.
Yeah.
But we went in,</v>

1163
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:43.250
so,
okay,
this is not dangerous now,
but you know,

1164
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:46.370
the Mogadishu airports are controlled by the UN and then there's that green

1165
01:12:46.371 --> 01:12:50.720
beach right there,
which is infested with bull sharks.

1166
01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:56.140
I think there were like 12 total shark attacks and a couple of fatalities on

1167
01:12:56.481 --> 01:12:57.314
that beach.

1168
01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.700
So we got tasked with doing the hydrographic recognizance.

1169
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:05.550
<v 0>There's some story about some kind of slaughter house or something that I never</v>

1170
01:13:05.551 --> 01:13:05.911
saw it,

1171
01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:10.740
but that was the story where there's a camel slaughterhouse and it just teeming

1172
01:13:10.741 --> 01:13:12.780
with blood and there's sharks can't resist.

1173
01:13:12.781 --> 01:13:16.530
That's exactly what we are going in with.
We had that story,
the big story,

1174
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:18.690
like the midget sniper in Iraq

1175
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:22.480
<v 2>and they're all,
they're all just waiting for you to hit the water,</v>

1176
01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:27.340
you know,
which is kind of what I think anytime I'm doing anything at night,

1177
01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.890
it was like in,
in the ocean.
You're like,

1178
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:33.700
like the sharks are just waiting right there for you to come in and just come up

1179
01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:34.310
and bite you.

1180
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:36.830
<v 0>I'm so stupid.
I never think about that.</v>

1181
01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:41.900
I never one time in my whole career thought,
okay,

1182
01:13:41.901 --> 01:13:43.940
I'm getting in the water.
It's night in southern California.

1183
01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:45.680
There's big sharks live here and there could be one.

1184
01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:49.180
I never thought about that for whatever reason.
I don't know.
I am too.

1185
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.010
<v 2>I do.
But then I'm like,
oh,
I'm cold now and I think about something else.</v>

1186
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:57.240
So you're,
so you guys take oak accents.
So wait.

1187
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:59.700
So we go to do a hydro recon and,

1188
01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:04.680
and because of the sharks we got to do this big perpendicular hydro recon,

1189
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:07.470
perpendicular,
parallel,
whatever.
Um,

1190
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:12.950
and we're doing it with Zodiacs and then were spaced every 50 yards and then the

1191
01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:17.950
ribs on the outside of it.
And the water is,
I mean,
so he is not swimming.

1192
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:22.390
We're not,
you're taking your cousin from boats and on,

1193
01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.870
there was a big net that we had to get out of there so that the elk acts,
Noi,

1194
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:26.704
handcraft come in.

1195
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:32.070
So I'm in the first rib and then an a rib is a,

1196
01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:38.800
like an inflatable,
whole 30 feet.

1197
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:42.990
And then the next one out is,
uh,
like 50 yards,
past marks.

1198
01:14:42.991 --> 01:14:46.960
So the water super clear,
like you can see the bottom and it's like 60 feet deep.

1199
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:52.720
And,
uh,
the boat out past me,
they're all yelling.
They're like,

1200
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:57.480
hey,
look down there,
some sharks down there.
So one of this,

1201
01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.640
the team guy that was in that boat jumps up on the sponsor of the rib to look at

1202
01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:07.840
the sharks and slips in the water.
And it was like,
he hit a trampoline.

1203
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.860
I don't know how he did it because that the river so high out of the water,

1204
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:17.230
you're like,
how did he even get it?
But he got in and he was out so fast.

1205
01:15:17.231 --> 01:15:21.940
I'm not even sure he got wet.
Oh.
And I don't blame them,

1206
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:25.540
but no,
we went in,
uh,
there was just,

1207
01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:29.080
the planning cycle was crazy for that four days.

1208
01:15:29.081 --> 01:15:32.830
Everybody was down to the spot they were going to be in.
We didn't,
our study,

1209
01:15:32.831 --> 01:15:36.310
there was a bunker that we wanted to use,
um,

1210
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.160
that would be a good position from where we were at.

1211
01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:44.190
So we run like the third lift on the elk [inaudible] those big hovercraft,

1212
01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:46.810
but you can't sit down on the deck.

1213
01:15:46.811 --> 01:15:51.580
So they had this big 40 foot mill van strapped to the deck.

1214
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:56.170
You went inside of it and then there was a bunch of troops seeding and then we

1215
01:15:56.171 --> 01:16:00.700
just rode in on that hope the thing didn't sink because you would just be done

1216
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:06.250
God out and then patrolled over to our spot where we,

1217
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:10.210
we wanted to set up in this,
this bunker.
And uh,

1218
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:15.610
it didn't work.
The slits out of the bunker,

1219
01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:20.020
the scope of my 50 cal would stick out and the scope was looking right at the

1220
01:16:20.021 --> 01:16:21.790
cement.
So then we built,

1221
01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:24.330
we got up on top of the bunker and we started filling sandbags,

1222
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.420
moving sandbags around.

1223
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:30.780
Made ourselves a little like firing position on top of that bunker and uh,

1224
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:35.890
um,
and that's where we send our cover down on your covering down,

1225
01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:40.060
looking for attackers on the,
came into to try and attack the airfield.

1226
01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.460
So the air field was controlled.

1227
01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:47.461
So we had set a perimeter up inside of the UN perimeter that was already there.

1228
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:53.200
And so the first day there,
nothing really happened cause it was all status quo.

1229
01:16:53.201 --> 01:16:56.710
The UN controlled the airfield,
there were watchtowers and stuff like that.

1230
01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:01.980
And then we had a line set up that was just a narrow strip of beach,

1231
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:04.900
um,
between us and the ocean.

1232
01:17:04.901 --> 01:17:09.260
So when the UN left and we would just all fall back into the amphibs and go back

1233
01:17:09.261 --> 01:17:13.070
out to the,
to the ships.
So the first day,
you know,

1234
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:17.760
there's always tracer fire going on in Mogadishu is pretty active.
Um,

1235
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:18.920
not much happened.

1236
01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.520
Then the next morning at like 4:00 AM all the manned positions were replaced by

1237
01:17:25.971 --> 01:17:30.530
tanks and then everybody left and they just,

1238
01:17:30.531 --> 01:17:35.000
there was a big camp,
like 500 yards to the south of us and they just,
uh,

1239
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:38.720
they just,
they just left everything there.
And then,

1240
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:44.300
then at like eight in the morning,
the tanks all left and just left it open.

1241
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:49.730
So there was this weird period of time where everyone was like,

1242
01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:50.840
what just happened?

1243
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:55.100
And then a lot of the civilian populace started piling in because there was
like,

1244
01:17:55.101 --> 01:17:58.220
there's water,
there's building materials.
They were ripping the roofing,

1245
01:17:58.221 --> 01:18:02.270
awful lot of the buildings at that,
these guys that just abandoned.
Um,

1246
01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.860
and then about an hour after that,
the,

1247
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:10.230
you know,
you had your different uh,
um,

1248
01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.690
warlords and factions figured out what was going on and then they had to stop

1249
01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.430
people from getting stuff cause they wanted it.

1250
01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.700
So we watched like a big crowd of people and it was just like in that movie,

1251
01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.510
there's a big crowd of people ripping stuff,
running everywhere,

1252
01:18:23.511 --> 01:18:26.480
ripping stuff out of these buildings.
And then guys show up with a jeep.

1253
01:18:26.481 --> 01:18:27.560
Would like a PKM,

1254
01:18:27.561 --> 01:18:31.340
which is a belt fed machine gun in the back and just aim at the people and start

1255
01:18:31.341 --> 01:18:35.590
shooting them and then you just see it like oil and water,
whatever.

1256
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.410
Everyone moved and they're just all taking off.

1257
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:44.620
So one clan kind of took control of a camp that was at 500 yards of the south

1258
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:51.410
end of the runway there.
Five,

1259
01:18:51.411 --> 01:18:56.000
600 yards away from us was the edge of that camp that was you and controlled the

1260
01:18:56.001 --> 01:18:56.990
other clan,

1261
01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:02.080
which these two major faction as a warlords down there control the other end of

1262
01:19:02.091 --> 01:19:02.924
the runway.

1263
01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.860
At one point they move down the runway and tried to attack this other clan that

1264
01:19:09.141 --> 01:19:11.780
was holding because you can't control half of a runway.

1265
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:15.070
And they had like this crate,

1266
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.920
they had crazy technicals and are our rules engagement,
let's hey,

1267
01:19:19.170 --> 01:19:21.470
they can have technicals out and that's a civilian vehicle.

1268
01:19:21.471 --> 01:19:24.920
It's like a road warrior vehicle with some kind of crew crew serve weapon in the

1269
01:19:24.921 --> 01:19:25.610
back.

1270
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:30.610
And they had one was like a big five ton truck with a clod antiaircraft guns sit

1271
01:19:31.631 --> 01:19:33.290
in the back where the dialect,
you know,

1272
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.540
dialing the thing to move it around and stuff.

1273
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:40.850
And they went halfway down the runway.
They tried to shoot it out,
but the,

1274
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:44.660
this other camp,
the other factions shot back and shot them off of there.

1275
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:49.370
So that went on.
But that was really those two fat.

1276
01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.810
There were some spillover tortoise,

1277
01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.930
but was as two factions shooting at each other.
Well,

1278
01:19:53.931 --> 01:19:56.030
at some point people start,

1279
01:19:56.031 --> 01:19:59.240
they started the one faction that controlled the south,

1280
01:19:59.241 --> 01:20:03.470
this camp to the south end of the runway started to shoot at us.

1281
01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:07.980
And so we started taking a lot of indiscriminate small arms fire.

1282
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:12.780
And then we had a,
uh,
a recoilless rifle launched at us,

1283
01:20:12.781 --> 01:20:17.700
but it went over and landed in the ocean and some random RPGs.

1284
01:20:17.701 --> 01:20:21.930
It was all pretty far away.
So you know,
as you know,

1285
01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:22.910
in an urban environment,
it's,

1286
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:26.370
it's really difficult to tell where you're getting shot at.
And then,

1287
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:31.020
especially when they're 600 yards away,
there's,
it's daylight.

1288
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.550
You can't see any muzzle flash.

1289
01:20:32.551 --> 01:20:36.240
So unless somebody gets really sloppy or you're really lucky,

1290
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:37.051
you're not going to see it.

1291
01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:41.820
And the way Mogadishu is like a big hillside with all these buildings and rolls

1292
01:20:41.821 --> 01:20:44.580
up,
it's just not like you're looking at one set of buildings.

1293
01:20:44.581 --> 01:20:47.250
You're looking at like a row billings,
then behind it,

1294
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:51.450
another old buildings and yeah,
just a giant,
giant mouse maze.

1295
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:53.060
So,
um,

1296
01:20:55.170 --> 01:21:00.170
saw a guy on a roof with an RPG and then a second later one gets launched at us

1297
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:06.560
and then we're like,
oh,
oh,
okay buddy mist.
And then,
uh,

1298
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.780
so we basically,
at that point they're like,
you're,
you're cleared hot.

1299
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:16.950
This is silly.
We've met our rules of engagement cause and then

1300
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:22.170
back in the 90s,
the appetite for applying lethal force was,

1301
01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:26.970
was pretty subdued.
It's not as liberal as it is today and how it should be.

1302
01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:30.000
And so it took us a little while to get there and they're like,
okay,

1303
01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.830
these guys are bad,
these guys are obviously trying to get us.

1304
01:21:34.831 --> 01:21:36.540
So you're cleared hot.

1305
01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:39.780
Find somebody to shoot Dana and couldn't find anyone to shoot for a while.

1306
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:43.080
Then this camp that was 500 yards of south of us,

1307
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:46.770
we saw it was a group of like seven guys,

1308
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.530
two of them had RPGs.

1309
01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:52.900
Your rocket propelled grenades and other guys patrolling with like two Pq,

1310
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:54.280
two PKM gunners,

1311
01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:59.530
their belt fed machine guns and like an AK gunner and they're patrolling and we

1312
01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:00.930
can see and we can see them.

1313
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.960
And now they come out the front of the camp and at the gate of that camp,

1314
01:22:06.091 --> 01:22:08.460
which is facing us 500 yards away,

1315
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:13.560
there's two sandbagged positions for the watches who would be up there to check

1316
01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:18.180
people coming in and out.
And they,
the guy,
there was one guy,

1317
01:22:18.181 --> 01:22:22.650
he had a gray.
Ironically,
he had a gray t shirt on that said army,

1318
01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:26.700
right?
And he's got an RPG and he's definitely in charge.

1319
01:22:26.701 --> 01:22:29.320
And he put a p Cam on one of the sandbags pointing us,

1320
01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.840
he's talking to guys given direction,
turns around,

1321
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.130
puts the the RPG on his shoulder and is looking at us through the site.

1322
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:43.680
And so are our,
oh,
I see is like,

1323
01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:46.410
okay,
well,
hey,
let's hold on,
see what we're doing.
The money.

1324
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:50.310
Whose money is really savvy,
he's like,
hey,

1325
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:54.960
they're getting ready to shoot at us.
He's adjusting the sites right now.

1326
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.250
He's getting an,
and we wanted to preempt this so I could shoot it.

1327
01:22:59.251 --> 01:23:02.970
The guy before he got a chance to launch CRPC cause they're close.

1328
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.210
That's a good plan.
So,
um,

1329
01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.900
oh,
I see.
He's like,
okay,
go shoot him.

1330
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.510
So I've got kind of a,
I've got a really jacked up firing position.

1331
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:21.100
It's a 500 yard shot.
I uh,
I squeeze,

1332
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:25.720
squeeze around off boom.
And then apparently I missed.

1333
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:29.000
So,
which,
which I,
my,

1334
01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:33.790
my shooting position was not good and I was really,
really like excited.

1335
01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:35.460
I that what they call,
you know,
buck fever.

1336
01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:39.490
It's a first time I've ever saw it at a human.
So I was worked up pretty good.
Um,

1337
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:44.800
and then the guy who was spotting for me,
it wasn't a spotter because there was,

1338
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:48.730
the sniper was in the other platoon or at the other,
the other firing position.

1339
01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:52.060
He was sitting right next to me on the sandbags,

1340
01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.840
looking through the spotting scope.
And when the 50 cal went off,

1341
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:59.770
it's got a big muzzle brake,
so the recoil doesn't break a collarbone,

1342
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:01.180
it ports back.

1343
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:06.510
It just blew a bunch of sand in his eyes and knock the spotting scope right out

1344
01:24:06.581 --> 01:24:11.380
of his hands.
So money's like,
Hey,
you missed.

1345
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:14.080
I'm like,
do you have a correction?
And,
and he's like,
no.

1346
01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:18.160
And it sounded like he was talking in slow motion because he was just just super

1347
01:24:18.161 --> 01:24:22.390
calm and cool and uh,
um,
I'm like,

1348
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.890
oh no.
Now I'm questioning whether I,
my,
my,
my dope,

1349
01:24:26.891 --> 01:24:31.660
my dad on previous gay for five fit 500 yards is any good or anything that 50

1350
01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:34.960
cal you to take the entire bolt out of the gun,

1351
01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:38.410
knock the brass out from the round.
You just fired,
put a new round in,

1352
01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:43.120
chamber it and reload.
So I chamber hit reload downrange.

1353
01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:48.880
They were,
they were like,
Ooh,
they just shot at us,
you know.

1354
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:50.560
So the guy was like,
wow.

1355
01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:55.160
So they're starting to talk and now he's got that RPG on his shoulder and now

1356
01:24:55.161 --> 01:24:57.460
our whole little harder.
I take a breath,
let half out,

1357
01:24:57.461 --> 01:25:00.850
start to squeeze that trigger.
I get that surprise bake,
boom,

1358
01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:06.160
pull the bolt out,
knocking the brass out,
load another round.
And I'm going,

1359
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:07.023
did I hit?

1360
01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:11.800
And our comms guy had grabbed by nose and he goes,

1361
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.550
oh man.
And I'm like,

1362
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.950
did I hit end?
He goes,
God,
Garnett,
good grief.

1363
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:25.210
And I'm thinking that he's going to tell me that I missed by like half a mile

1364
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:27.730
and he doesn't even know what kind of correction to give me.

1365
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.960
And I hit him in the arm.
I'm like,
dude,
what happened?
Did I hit any good?

1366
01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:36.970
And he didn't even hear me.
He goes,
he is.
Oh,

1367
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.140
that had to hurt.

1368
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:43.420
So now that PKM gunner who,

1369
01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:48.120
who was set up on the sandbags,
he just lets her rip.
And so there's the,
the,

1370
01:25:48.121 --> 01:25:52.570
the bullwhip crap.
So those rounds going over the top of us and man,
he's like,

1371
01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:56.740
Hey,
I think this guy's right,
right at 500 yards.
You got,
you're dialed in.

1372
01:25:56.741 --> 01:25:59.320
You know,
he's just talking in my ear like,
man,

1373
01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:04.070
like we're going to get the mail or something or,
or whatever.
Just calm.

1374
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:08.690
And then,
uh,
so I can't see the guy at all.

1375
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:10.400
All I can see as the muzzle flash.

1376
01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:12.800
So I put the cross hairs in the middle of the muzzle flash,

1377
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:18.170
squeeze the round off,
reload,
come back up and look to see what,

1378
01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:22.370
what had happened.
And there was uh,

1379
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.610
the gun had spilled over the front side of the sandbags.

1380
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:29.780
There was a huge divot in the sand.
I couldn't see,
I couldn't tell,

1381
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:33.260
I think I hit the rifle,
but then he had spilled out,

1382
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:37.910
he was out from the side of the sandbags on his side and,
and it's just,

1383
01:26:37.911 --> 01:26:38.960
his guts were everywhere.

1384
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:42.920
He was flailing around for a little bit and then he expired I assume cause I

1385
01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:47.921
quit looking at him at that point because a jeep had now shown up and it had

1386
01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:53.210
like one of their 50,
51 cows in the back and the guy is just new go boom,

1387
01:26:53.211 --> 01:26:56.300
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.
And I'm thinking,
Oh man,

1388
01:26:56.301 --> 01:27:00.320
we've grabbed the tiger by the tail cause I've got this round,
I can,
you know,

1389
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:01.460
one round at a time.

1390
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.240
And I'm waiting for like there was a tow missile gunner right in your position

1391
01:27:07.551 --> 01:27:10.100
for him to light it up.
But uh,

1392
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.100
we'd gotten really,

1393
01:27:13.101 --> 01:27:17.120
really strict rules of engagement briefings before we went in.

1394
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:21.170
So the guys were a little bit hesitant to let her rip.
So that shot,

1395
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:24.140
I rushed,
I wound up hitting the jeep

1396
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:29.930
right on the sidewalls between the gunners legs.
But that was enough.

1397
01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.170
Soon as the jeep got hit,
boom,
they drove away and they were done.

1398
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:38.380
And then these guys started to do a peel and it was a really organized squared

1399
01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:42.450
away.
Good peels.
So they were peeling behind the buildings of the,

1400
01:27:42.451 --> 01:27:46.010
now they are starting to gain a little bit of distance on us and they were

1401
01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:50.870
falling behind this big building.
[inaudible]
has given me,
gives me another round.

1402
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:55.130
He's like,
Hey,
I think there are about 700 yards now adjust your dope.
So I.
Dot.

1403
01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:56.480
Made my adjustment from,

1404
01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:01.850
from where I was just shooting at to to 700 and as you know,

1405
01:28:01.851 --> 01:28:04.850
as the,
they're doing appeal,
a guy gets up and runs.

1406
01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:08.780
So there was a guy I've run in full value and he's running across with,

1407
01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:11.600
with the Rock Rpg.
So I shot at him,

1408
01:28:12.150 --> 01:28:15.200
hit way behind him and he went behind the building,

1409
01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:20.180
then reloaded two more guys peeled behind the building and they were just gone.

1410
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:23.030
So I held,

1411
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.860
I held my cross hairs on the edge of that building where they had just gone in a

1412
01:28:27.861 --> 01:28:28.700
second later,

1413
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:33.320
the guy with the RPG steps back out into my crosshairs.

1414
01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:39.160
And so my cross hairs are squared up on his pelvis and I start loading the

1415
01:28:41.391 --> 01:28:44.840
trigger as he's taken a knee to shoot the RPG.

1416
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:50.030
So his heat knee hit the ground when that 50 cal round hit him in the chest.

1417
01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:53.330
And so we were shooting,
uh,
the,
Ralph asked mark to 11,

1418
01:28:53.331 --> 01:28:57.920
which is a multipurpose armor piercing around and it explodes when it hit

1419
01:28:57.921 --> 01:29:00.650
something hard.
And the spotters like,
Bro,

1420
01:29:00.651 --> 01:29:05.640
that thing right up when it hit his chest
down,
he went.

1421
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:10.620
And then,
uh,
then that was it.
Then they got some guys over there that,
uh,

1422
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:15.540
linguists and they had loud speakers on their Humvees and they were like,
Hey,

1423
01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:19.080
don't shoot at us.
We're not taking sides in this whole thing.

1424
01:29:19.081 --> 01:29:23.360
And that kind of calmed everything down for the next couple hours,

1425
01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:27.870
um,
and end of that day,
and then we watched the guide.

1426
01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:32.340
It's like life was incredibly cheap there.

1427
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.990
Saw a guy get pushed off a roof.
We're watching,
uh,
um,

1428
01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.780
in the evening we had gotten,
someone said like,
Hey,

1429
01:29:39.781 --> 01:29:43.320
this one building about two kilometers away,

1430
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:48.800
that's when the clan leaders buildings and we could see guys up there in the

1431
01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:53.040
evening and they get that cop there that makes them all go kind of crazy.

1432
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.140
And we'd see guys sitting there like watching the sunset up on a roof and then

1433
01:29:58.290 --> 01:30:01.620
one of them would start to get animated and waving their arms around.

1434
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.400
Like they were arguing about something.
Then they're all animated.

1435
01:30:05.401 --> 01:30:08.160
Then they were up like beating each other with clubs,

1436
01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.900
hitting each other with rocks.

1437
01:30:09.930 --> 01:30:14.220
And then it would just stop and then it would start up again.

1438
01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:17.820
And I think at least one of those we've watched the guy just get pushed off a

1439
01:30:17.821 --> 01:30:22.710
roof,
fall dead.
That's just how they roll.

1440
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:26.190
And so this,
so the first day was pretty mellow with this.

1441
01:30:26.191 --> 01:30:28.410
All this activity took place on the second or the third day.

1442
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:29.430
First Day was mellow,

1443
01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:33.600
second day was a owes when they pulled back.

1444
01:30:33.601 --> 01:30:36.610
And then the third days when they said no,
the first day was metal.

1445
01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:38.220
Second morning is when they pulled back.

1446
01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.740
And then the second day is when we got in that first firefight.

1447
01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:45.960
And then it was either that afternoon or the next day,
my memory,

1448
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:47.550
you know,
it's been 13 years,

1449
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:52.170
Emory slips where they called and they had,

1450
01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:55.800
they had an issue with the guy.
They're like,
Hey,
what are three years?
But yeah,

1451
01:30:55.801 --> 01:31:00.210
we'll take it.
Okay,
I should have taken more disciplined.

1452
01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:05.430
Um,
they,
uh,
they hit us up.
They're like,

1453
01:31:05.431 --> 01:31:05.910
Hey,

1454
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:10.890
we've got a guy down here that is close to where we're getting ready to move

1455
01:31:10.891 --> 01:31:13.470
some armor and he has an 84,

1456
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:17.970
which is weird because that's one of our weapons.
It wasn't an RPG hit.

1457
01:31:17.971 --> 01:31:22.971
He had a legit 84 and they shot at him and he ran away and came back.

1458
01:31:23.461 --> 01:31:26.040
They were like,
he's going to use it.
So we want to do this deal.

1459
01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:30.570
We're going to have a sniper initiated kind of assault on this guy.

1460
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:32.160
So I'm

1461
01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:39.330
listen an l e v over to our position,
me and the,
Oh,
I see God in it.

1462
01:31:39.331 --> 01:31:43.530
And we went and saw the the lieutenant colonel and he's like,
Hey,

1463
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:48.060
I'm here.
We studied a map.
He's like,
Hey,
here's where the guy is.

1464
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:52.350
I think a good spot is this tower.
There's some recon guys up there.

1465
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.790
I'm going to put you up there with them and then then get this going.
So

1466
01:31:58.770 --> 01:32:02.350
I went up to the tower,
we moved up to the tower.

1467
01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:07.270
The guy showed us what it was,
was out there.
There was a set of bunkers,

1468
01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:12.040
it's alongside of the airfield that was now controlled by just whoever.

1469
01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:16.060
And this guy was in one of the bunkers.

1470
01:32:16.061 --> 01:32:19.570
And then he would come out with like six or seven other guys and you in a,

1471
01:32:19.571 --> 01:32:22.060
you know,
and they would smoke cigarettes and he had the 84 and he would,

1472
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.380
they were watching the u s lines.
So they said,
hey,
here's what we want you to do.

1473
01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:31.270
Um,
you know,
he keeps coming in and out when he comes out again,

1474
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:35.620
we want you to shoot him and then we're going to have,

1475
01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:40.300
they shifted some of the light armored vehicles down the line to where they

1476
01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:41.134
could go at,

1477
01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:45.910
go at the bunker with their co-ax guns and try and get him and his buddies.

1478
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.480
Um,
so we put us up in the tower.

1479
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.020
There's this like 20 mile an hour wind,

1480
01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:56.530
just howling full value.

1481
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:58.870
It's a right to left.

1482
01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:04.240
And then it's from where I was in the tower,
it's a thousand yard shot.

1483
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.923
So,

1484
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:11.950
so I got a bunch of sandbags bunkered my position up.
We waited around,
you know,

1485
01:33:11.951 --> 01:33:13.630
for the guy to come up.
He comes up.

1486
01:33:14.050 --> 01:33:18.310
So I take this thousand yard shot at a guy in a 20 mile an hour,
you know,

1487
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:19.690
full value crosswind,

1488
01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:23.200
which at the time there's probably two or three people in the world that can

1489
01:33:23.201 --> 01:33:27.970
make a shot like that and I'm not.
One of them.
I missed and hit his buddy.

1490
01:33:31.210 --> 01:33:35.050
So I didn't hit the guy with the 84.

1491
01:33:35.051 --> 01:33:39.580
I hit the guy with the AK 47 Stan in three feet to his right because I put in

1492
01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:42.760
too much wind and they all dove in the bunkers.

1493
01:33:42.761 --> 01:33:46.960
Then everybody on the line started shooting the bunkers toward the bunkers up.

1494
01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:52.770
They called the ceasefire and the one of those guys survived and it was the guy

1495
01:33:54.521 --> 01:33:58.330
that had that 84,
but he left it and he just got up and ran away.

1496
01:33:59.230 --> 01:34:00.063
Um,

1497
01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.300
then at a later point there was a guys they were shooting at the ELC acts as

1498
01:34:04.301 --> 01:34:08.170
they were coming in and out.
And so we,
we s there was a,

1499
01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:13.030
there was a big cinder block wall,
seven a hundred yards away away from the,

1500
01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:16.660
uh,
um,
the airfield there.

1501
01:34:16.690 --> 01:34:19.360
And he was on the other side of it and there's one block missing and he would

1502
01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:20.740
look through and shoot through it.

1503
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:23.910
So I shot at him and hit the wall right next to the,

1504
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:28.210
where he was shooting at and I scared him away and then come back.

1505
01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.850
But uh,
then that was it.

1506
01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:36.060
Then the next day we packed up and everybody fell back out to the ship.

1507
01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:42.490
The marines ran a great operation because everything kind of went like

1508
01:34:42.491 --> 01:34:44.980
clockwork.
Exactly the way it was supposed to.

1509
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.660
And it was a good to go.
Then you went back on elk acts,

1510
01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:53.080
you just said the either Yell Cox came up on the beach back in the mill van God

1511
01:34:53.081 --> 01:34:54.910
back in the middle of and went back out to the ship.

1512
01:34:54.911 --> 01:34:59.911
And then the final deal was there was just a strip of the amphibs that just

1513
01:35:00.891 --> 01:35:05.690
drove out to sea as they broke down the final deal.
And that was it.

1514
01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:08.490
Yeah.
And that was it.
That was,
but,

1515
01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.920
but then I was like one of six guys at the time on the west coast that had,

1516
01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:16.370
you know,
been on the trigger.
And,
and been in combat.

1517
01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.630
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
I remember it was awesome.</v>

1518
01:35:18.690 --> 01:35:22.650
I was super stoked and super jealous.
Of course.

1519
01:35:22.651 --> 01:35:25.020
Like every other guy was like,

1520
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.580
which actually this isn't why I did another arc because it seemed like,
hey,

1521
01:35:29.581 --> 01:35:30.960
if you're going to get some action,

1522
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:35.160
you need to go with the Marine Corps in the Arg and go out and do that.

1523
01:35:35.161 --> 01:35:38.670
That's why myself and all the other guys that,
you know,
all my old running mates,

1524
01:35:38.671 --> 01:35:41.790
we all were like,
okay,
we'll just do another arc.
Get back over there.
Let's,

1525
01:35:41.791 --> 01:35:43.950
let's make this APP.
Let's go into the problem.
I mean,

1526
01:35:43.951 --> 01:35:45.000
I had two dogs and two cats.

1527
01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.540
<v 2>My action ribbons.
Yeah.
And then,
you know,</v>

1528
01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:52.340
it worked out for a lot of other guys since then or before that because there

1529
01:35:52.341 --> 01:35:55.240
were two.
The other guys that had rotated through Somalia,

1530
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:56.660
had been on art platoon.

1531
01:35:58.110 --> 01:36:02.340
<v 0>When you get home,
you know what was going on.
Were you married at this point?</v>

1532
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:07.580
<v 2>I was.
I was married to my son's mother.
And,
uh,
and when did you get married?</v>

1533
01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:12.480
<v 0>I don't remember.
Was it,
was it?
No,
but not,
not what year,</v>

1534
01:36:12.481 --> 01:36:16.120
but like what have been trading cell at the time was in training cells time I

1535
01:36:16.121 --> 01:36:18.330
was at two.
You're pretty much a f uh,

1536
01:36:18.570 --> 01:36:21.210
less than a year of marriage or maybe two years of marriage at this point.

1537
01:36:23.130 --> 01:36:27.090
And then how,
how is that dealing with,
you know,

1538
01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:31.780
being gone and being the team guy marriage,
which is generally really hard.

1539
01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.510
<v 2>It was hard.
And it,</v>

1540
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:37.710
I want to back up really quick cause I want to make sure I point this out before

1541
01:36:37.711 --> 01:36:38.700
we get into this next thing.

1542
01:36:38.701 --> 01:36:43.020
And another thing that that Mani [inaudible] taught me that we kind of talked

1543
01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:48.230
about a little bit was he's like wherever you go run for mayor and he's just

1544
01:36:49.231 --> 01:36:53.700
talking about be good to everyone everywhere you go because they're going to go

1545
01:36:53.701 --> 01:36:57.810
out of their way to take care of you.
So like the,
that crew on the organ,

1546
01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:58.650
on that deployment,

1547
01:36:58.990 --> 01:37:03.300
they took great care of us because he always went out of his way to be good to

1548
01:37:03.301 --> 01:37:04.134
everybody.

1549
01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:08.940
<v 0>You know,
just to go back to Monte a little bit,
it's weird to think about</v>

1550
01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:13.110
now,
right?
You look back at what you did now,

1551
01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:17.490
what you've done since then,
which is obviously a ton,

1552
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.910
and going back to you being there.

1553
01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:24.980
And when I think about it in my mind about how just,
uh,

1554
01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.150
I guess immature is part of the word,

1555
01:37:27.151 --> 01:37:30.180
but it's beyond just being immature because I'm not just talking about being

1556
01:37:30.181 --> 01:37:33.270
immature and the traditional sense of the word I'm talking about being combat

1557
01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.260
immature,
meaning no one had any combat.
Right.

1558
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:42.770
And I think about just having a guy like Moni who's like levelheaded,

1559
01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:46.680
who's been in some shit before and can go,
you know what?
Hey,

1560
01:37:46.890 --> 01:37:48.720
we need to shoot this guy before he shoots at us.

1561
01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:52.140
That's just totally sensible thing to say.
But if,
if everyone's,

1562
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:57.000
because you've got these massive roe briefs and everyone's being paranoid and

1563
01:37:57.001 --> 01:37:59.310
you can't,
hey listen,
we don't want,
we don't want this to escalate.

1564
01:37:59.310 --> 01:38:03.060
And all of these things are in everyone's head.
Yup.
And it's so easy.

1565
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.760
It's kind of like the detachment when you just go,
hey,
you know what?

1566
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:08.550
This guy has an RPG,
they just shot one at us.

1567
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.570
He's aiming it and he's going to shoot us again.
We need to kill this guy.
Okay,

1568
01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.190
go ahead.
And then instead of,
you know,
dude,
you're low,
you're low,
you know,

1569
01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:21.630
or whatever,
just hey,
you're good.
Load another round.
Just being calm.

1570
01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:26.550
When I think about the advantage and how that's a pretty good performance,

1571
01:38:27.150 --> 01:38:31.950
what you guys was a pretty good performance with no experience because I think

1572
01:38:31.951 --> 01:38:34.060
of how,
you know,

1573
01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:37.110
what I gained through experience and the maturity,

1574
01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.290
the combat maturity of seeing things and things unfolding and being like,
okay,

1575
01:38:40.291 --> 01:38:44.370
I can handle this right now or this isn't a big deal or whatever.
But man,

1576
01:38:44.371 --> 01:38:45.960
when you're,
when you don't have that,

1577
01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:49.320
everyone's all excited that everyone's freaking out and everything's just

1578
01:38:49.321 --> 01:38:53.810
magnified and so it's pretty impressive.
And it,
to me,
you know,

1579
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.930
again,
you have a guy like money that's just looking at the OIC,

1580
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.510
his boss and saying,
Hey,

1581
01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:03.590
we actually need to kill this guy right now and not be like,
well,

1582
01:39:03.591 --> 01:39:07.200
you need to take this guy out,
which just escalate.
Then the OIC is thinking,

1583
01:39:07.201 --> 01:39:10.950
oh my God,
you know,
he might say,
shut up,
you know,
whatever.
Just going,
hey man,

1584
01:39:10.951 --> 01:39:15.420
we need to take this guy out.
Just just having that mentality is,

1585
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:19.800
is so important and I dunno how well would you guys have done if he wasn't
there?

1586
01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.770
<v 2>I don't think we'd done as well and we,</v>

1587
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:25.030
we might not even been in the position where we shot.

1588
01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.970
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

1589
01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:31.630
<v 2>yeah cause he just carried us through that whole thing.
He,
he,</v>

1590
01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:35.410
he had a funny thing he taught us.
He goes,
if you're ever really excited,

1591
01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:39.100
and he may have put this out to you too,
over the radio.
He goes,

1592
01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:43.510
if you try to talk like you have a southern drawl,

1593
01:39:45.190 --> 01:39:49.630
it'll slow you down.
And he goes,
and you won't have a southern draw by the way,

1594
01:39:49.631 --> 01:39:52.650
but it will slow you down.
And he told us of a case.
There was a,

1595
01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:57.160
some officers in a high speed chase and they were so calm over the radio.

1596
01:39:57.161 --> 01:40:02.161
People didn't believe that they were in a high speed chase except for the Rep.

1597
01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:06.430
The speed at which they're gone out.
We just pass this street.

1598
01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:07.570
We just passed this street.

1599
01:40:07.571 --> 01:40:10.970
We just passed this street because they were cool as cucumber commerce.

1600
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:15.170
<v 0>You know,
they're not freaking out.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
That's definitely just,</v>

1601
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:16.640
it's cool to hear that story.

1602
01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:21.700
And you've probably told me that story 21 years ago or something like that and I

1603
01:40:21.981 --> 01:40:26.981
actually heard you brief that story to a bunch of people at a dog and pony show

1604
01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:31.940
and uh,
it was really epic to hear you tell that story.
But d to hear the full,

1605
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:34.310
actually younger,
do you ever give you that detailed of a debrief?

1606
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:38.750
But it's awesome that at that time,
no combat experience.
It's like,
okay,

1607
01:40:38.751 --> 01:40:43.220
here's what we're going to do and that's a good lesson for everyone,
man.

1608
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:46.820
Detached,
stay calm,
look at what's going on.
And it all does.

1609
01:40:46.821 --> 01:40:49.400
Go back to the fact that you were in that position,

1610
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:53.030
probably had something to do with the fact that you,
that you,

1611
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.070
you were running for

1612
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.180
<v 2>mayor or,
or you know,</v>

1613
01:40:55.181 --> 01:40:58.150
Mani as a platoon chief was running for mayor and building relationships and

1614
01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:00.850
hanging out with the marines and teaching them whatever and getting,

1615
01:41:00.851 --> 01:41:02.260
giving them some gear and what,
you know,

1616
01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:05.170
just doing those things that you're building relationships with the rest of the

1617
01:41:05.171 --> 01:41:09.400
team is of being an arrogant jerk to everyone because you think you're better

1618
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:10.360
than him.
Absolutely.

1619
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:15.370
Cause there was another unit that had 50 cal sniper rifles that didn't get to

1620
01:41:15.881 --> 01:41:20.470
come.
Well,
there you go.
There it is.
Okay.

1621
01:41:20.471 --> 01:41:23.410
So now you get back.
And how long was that deployment?

1622
01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:26.470
Was that just a six month or a wool?
They,
they were already deployed,

1623
01:41:26.471 --> 01:41:29.370
so I didn't look three and a half months with them cause I replaced it.

1624
01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:33.670
Got a guy that got in trouble.
Got It.
And then,
but okay.

1625
01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:38.671
So now we were starting to dive into a marital scenario that was going on.

1626
01:41:38.711 --> 01:41:40.270
So you've got a kid already,
you've got a kid.

1627
01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:46.820
Uh,

1628
01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:51.680
my son's mother was pregnant when I went on that deployment and so he was,

1629
01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:55.790
that was in February and he was born in September of [inaudible] 95 truck.

1630
01:41:56.990 --> 01:42:01.820
So yeah,
I came back and then it was one of those situations where,

1631
01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:03.493
um,

1632
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:09.720
me being gone all the time didn't help but me being home all the time didn't

1633
01:42:09.721 --> 01:42:11.990
help either and it and,

1634
01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.640
and so we just parted ways and it,
it was,
uh,

1635
01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:21.680
it was hard for me not to have my son in my house,
but it was,

1636
01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:26.380
it was the best thing because me and his mom just didn't get along.
Um,

1637
01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.580
and then this is at the point,
at the same time,
this is this,
when you got out,

1638
01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:33.630
this is ripe with it.
Art,

1639
01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:37.760
we got divorced right after I got out.

1640
01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.790
Which did you get out with the vision in mind that you're going to be able to

1641
01:42:40.791 --> 01:42:43.450
save this thing or did you get out with it in your mind like,
no,

1642
01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:46.760
this is already too far south.
No.
Yeah,
I got out.
She,
she wanted to like,
Hey,

1643
01:42:46.761 --> 01:42:50.810
I want you around more.
You're gone too much.
Is,
you know,

1644
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:54.590
this isn't good and get that.
But then so you got out,

1645
01:42:54.591 --> 01:42:59.270
I got out and then she realized that she really doesn't like,
yeah,

1646
01:42:59.271 --> 01:43:02.630
pretty much and I can't blame her.
So,

1647
01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:06.610
so then then we ended up separating or,
or get,
you know,

1648
01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.450
going through the new land,
getting out,

1649
01:43:09.410 --> 01:43:13.380
oh I was going to go work for a guide doing some kind of uh,
um,

1650
01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:18.190
investment stuff.
Cause that makes a lot of sense to

1651
01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:24.740
me.
There was no plan.
It wasn't thought through.

1652
01:43:24.741 --> 01:43:27.800
The smartest thing I did was the date.
The day I got out,

1653
01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:31.310
I enlisted in the or or I joined the reserves.
So I was in the seal team,

1654
01:43:31.311 --> 01:43:35.810
five reserve teams.
So I did that for a year and a half.

1655
01:43:36.110 --> 01:43:40.950
And then when all the dust settled and uh,
with,

1656
01:43:40.951 --> 01:43:42.810
with uh,
the,
you know,

1657
01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:46.020
who's going to have custody and where my son's going to live,
it was like,

1658
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:47.340
what am I doing?

1659
01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:52.160
I'm only happy when I go to do my reserve drill.

1660
01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.660
And so I'm like,
Hey,
I want to go back on active duty.
At the time,

1661
01:43:56.661 --> 01:44:00.770
they were critically under man for East sixes.
So they're like boom.

1662
01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:06.020
So the timing,
my timing,
I've been so lucky for my timing,

1663
01:44:06.021 --> 01:44:11.021
like being on the quarter back that one day I checked into trade at in August of

1664
01:44:11.031 --> 01:44:14.090
2001 into the sniper cell.

1665
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:19.490
And then you know the planes hit the towers and then the teams are just off to

1666
01:44:19.491 --> 01:44:24.410
the races.
Yeah.
Did you,
when you,
when you were civilian,

1667
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:28.220
<v 0>um,
or whatever you were a reservist,
civilian,</v>

1668
01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:32.780
how long did it take you to realize that this was a bad call and I'm going to

1669
01:44:32.781 --> 01:44:33.381
jump forward.

1670
01:44:33.381 --> 01:44:37.490
Like when you would have guys that were saying they were going to get out at 13

1671
01:44:37.491 --> 01:44:41.870
years or nine years or whatever.
Did you,
what'd you tell him about that?

1672
01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.550
<v 2>Oh,
you mean later?
Yeah,
like later.</v>

1673
01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:49.100
<v 0>Like,
cause you know,
I would,
you know,
when I was,
well,
you know,</v>

1674
01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.710
once I was an officer and I would have friends that were like,
Hey,

1675
01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:53.620
I'm going to get out.
And you know,

1676
01:44:53.621 --> 01:44:57.040
I'd say the experience I had was I went to college.
Right.

1677
01:44:57.250 --> 01:44:59.800
And when I went to college for three years and when I came back I was like,

1678
01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.290
the main thing I learned in college was never,
ever,
ever,

1679
01:45:02.291 --> 01:45:05.950
ever get out of the team's ever.
Because dealing with other people,

1680
01:45:06.130 --> 01:45:10.570
it was just so horrible.
And especially,

1681
01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:15.900
I mean like you and me who literally spent our whole adult lives in a platoon

1682
01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:21.100
you get out of in the know with normal people and you're like,

1683
01:45:21.101 --> 01:45:24.460
what are the everyone doing once I have w why is this even happening?

1684
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:26.020
It just nothing makes sense.

1685
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:29.630
<v 2>Yeah,
there was a lot of awkward silences.
No one gets your jokes.</v>

1686
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.490
And it was a,
what I usually tell guys is like,
Hey,

1687
01:45:34.491 --> 01:45:37.790
I got broken service and you're going,
once you get out,

1688
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.950
you're going to miss this peer group,

1689
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:45.050
you'll miss this job and I don't think you're gonna make that much more money.

1690
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:48.500
And,
but I never,

1691
01:45:48.501 --> 01:45:53.501
I always tried to soft sell hay and I w I would tell guys,

1692
01:45:55.130 --> 01:45:57.890
here's my phone number.
Do not lose my phone number.

1693
01:45:58.250 --> 01:46:03.170
And if you decide you want to come back and please call me,
I will,
you know,

1694
01:46:03.171 --> 01:46:07.780
figuring out how to get you wherever I'm at or back in and a,
and a,

1695
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:10.880
and I've done that for at least two or three guys.
Yeah,

1696
01:46:11.630 --> 01:46:15.050
<v 0>no,
it's a,
I know it's a hard decision for guys to make and it usually,</v>

1697
01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:17.480
and sometimes it's um,
what does that,

1698
01:46:17.481 --> 01:46:20.720
it's an emotional decision completely because they had a bad deployment,

1699
01:46:20.721 --> 01:46:23.780
they didn't like someone or their wife's mad at or whatever.

1700
01:46:23.781 --> 01:46:28.781
And they make that emotional decision when in fact the teams can take care of

1701
01:46:29.241 --> 01:46:32.630
you too.
You know,
the teams can go,
hey look,
we know you need some downtime.

1702
01:46:32.631 --> 01:46:35.390
You're going to go to buds and being an instructor or whatever,
you know,

1703
01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:39.560
for three years,
you know,
you can get your kid through high school or whatever.

1704
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:44.150
So the teams does a good job usually of taking care of,

1705
01:46:44.670 --> 01:46:48.320
of the people,
you know,
taking care of team guys.
But sometimes you know,
people,

1706
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:53.400
they have the grasses screener situation and again in the 90s,

1707
01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:54.440
<v 1>okay,</v>

1708
01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:57.740
<v 2>we're playing,
we're training for a big game that we're not going to do.</v>

1709
01:46:57.741 --> 01:47:01.480
And so there was a loss of job satisfaction there.
Yeah.
And,

1710
01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:05.390
and who knows where NSW,
what trajectory we were on.

1711
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:10.430
Had these wars not started.
Yeah,
that's a good question.

1712
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:11.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1713
01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:12.330
<v 0>That's a scary question.</v>

1714
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:14.683
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1715
01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.710
<v 0>So what'd you do when you got back in?
She went,</v>

1716
01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:20.830
<v 2>got great when went into trade at,</v>

1717
01:47:20.831 --> 01:47:25.240
just got stood up and I went into the sand up.
That was 2001.

1718
01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:30.640
That's lucky.
Huh?
Uh Huh.
And so I got in and there they're like,
hey,

1719
01:47:30.670 --> 01:47:34.060
we're going to do a sniper cell and we're going to be dedicated to this,

1720
01:47:34.061 --> 01:47:38.320
which is something that wasn't replicated on the other coast.
Um,

1721
01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:40.750
I was like,
Oh man,
are you kidding me?

1722
01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:42.580
I'm just going to do sniper stuff all the time.

1723
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:47.160
<v 0>Yeah.
Throw me in that our patch.
And you were the perfect,</v>

1724
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:49.140
literally the perfect guy,

1725
01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:54.230
and they probably were just overjoyed to have you come in there and did it meet

1726
01:47:54.661 --> 01:47:59.010
world experience,
which is serious at that time because no one had it.

1727
01:47:59.550 --> 01:47:59.940
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.700
And so it allows you to say stuff to people in and they're going to listen to

1729
01:48:02.701 --> 01:48:04.170
you like,
like we were talking about earlier,

1730
01:48:04.171 --> 01:48:05.280
where if a guy tells you to get your,

1731
01:48:05.281 --> 01:48:09.420
get your haircut and he's a goofball and ain't done anything,
you're just like,

1732
01:48:09.421 --> 01:48:10.254
yeah,
whatever.

1733
01:48:12.170 --> 01:48:15.260
<v 0>And,
and then when you're running that sniper course,</v>

1734
01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:17.710
<v 1>okay,</v>

1735
01:48:17.710 --> 01:48:18.820
<v 0>are you guys now,</v>

1736
01:48:18.821 --> 01:48:21.730
was that the sniper course know the sniper course was already stood up.

1737
01:48:21.731 --> 01:48:24.580
So now what we're doing,
this is what we kind of ended up with that trade at,

1738
01:48:24.581 --> 01:48:27.010
which is you guys are going out to training,

1739
01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:32.110
you're implementing sniper things into the overall training and you're doing

1740
01:48:32.111 --> 01:48:34.540
specialized training for the snipers.
That's what you ended up.

1741
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.790
<v 2>Yeah.
So for a little bit,
we were still running the sniper course,</v>

1742
01:48:38.791 --> 01:48:43.791
I think until like 2002 or three and then doing the sustainment training.

1743
01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:49.200
And so,
you know,
we developed a urban course,

1744
01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.310
the long range target interdiction course,
which they stay,

1745
01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:57.960
they have a different variant on it now.
But,
um,
you know,
that's,
uh,
the land,

1746
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.660
it was under land warfare and the land warfare,
oh,

1747
01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:04.910
I see at the time was a warrant officer Pritchard,
Doug Pritchard.

1748
01:49:04.911 --> 01:49:09.350
He's an awesome dude.
He still works in shooting to this day.
And,
uh,

1749
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:13.260
we got a lot of cool stuff done.
Like we got the,
the ballistic computers,

1750
01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:15.150
which made,
you know,

1751
01:49:15.450 --> 01:49:20.450
shooting a whole lot more predictable and then we could get guns ready to go and

1752
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:24.540
a lot less rounds because we have these computers that did it.

1753
01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:28.170
And we did a lot of good research and development and then tactics that we could

1754
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:32.010
push directly to the platoons,
which,
I mean,

1755
01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:35.730
NSW snipers are like the mainstay.

1756
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:37.270
<v 1>Hmm</v>

1757
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:42.250
<v 2>[inaudible] group,
I think of,
of snipers in the world.
Yeah.</v>

1758
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:46.270
I'm not saying that we're better than anybody because everybody's really good,

1759
01:49:46.271 --> 01:49:51.271
but we've had really rich history of employing snipers and doing stuff with,

1760
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:55.800
with snipers,
you know,
as you well know.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1761
01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.700
And speaking of that,

1762
01:49:57.701 --> 01:50:01.650
how did you end up doing an augment because you've augmented to Ramadi,
right?

1763
01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:02.140
Right.

1764
01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:07.140
And what year was at 2005 so there was,

1765
01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:12.280
there was some of that video that got released of a,
you know,

1766
01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:15.940
it's guy getting a couple snipers or whatever it was in Ramadi.

1767
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:20.410
And uh,
the commodore at the time saw that and he goes,

1768
01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:24.040
that's it.
And they,

1769
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:29.070
they had a piece of gear that was supposed to help us detect enemy snipers.

1770
01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:35.440
And so they bought some,
they gave it to us to test out real quick.

1771
01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:40.770
And then we got to take it forward with a seal team seven to go,

1772
01:50:40.841 --> 01:50:45.430
hey,
here's this new gear,
here's how you use it.
And uh,

1773
01:50:45.490 --> 01:50:47.710
and then it also gave us the ability to get,

1774
01:50:48.490 --> 01:50:50.650
get straight over there and kind of ended the fight.

1775
01:50:50.651 --> 01:50:55.210
So we team seven had just moved into the shark based there,
Ramadi.

1776
01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:58.930
And then we went in there with them and they,

1777
01:50:58.990 --> 01:51:02.590
and did you stay there for six weeks?
I wasn't awesome.

1778
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:08.020
So cool.
So cool.
I didn't,
I didn't want to come back.

1779
01:51:08.021 --> 01:51:11.980
But you know,
you come from the strand.
I didn't do the workup.

1780
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:16.210
My guys didn't do the workup and there's other guys doing PSD and they're like,

1781
01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:16.421
hey,

1782
01:51:16.421 --> 01:51:20.110
what's up with these dudes who aren't even at our team and they're going out on

1783
01:51:20.111 --> 01:51:25.030
sniper missions so it's not cool.
It's combat tourism.

1784
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:29.860
And I was super lucky that we were able to,
you know,
be there as long as we were.

1785
01:51:29.861 --> 01:51:31.780
And then it was just like,
ah,
it's time to go.

1786
01:51:32.010 --> 01:51:34.750
You did a turnover with the guys that were there.
In other words,

1787
01:51:34.751 --> 01:51:39.751
you taught them how to use the system and cops with them when he got to go out

1788
01:51:39.761 --> 01:51:42.750
and some ops with them got to go on a lot of data.

1789
01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:47.820
Like my favorite thing to do was go out on daytime presence patrols with the

1790
01:51:48.551 --> 01:51:52.390
army or the Marine Corps because that's what was so fun,

1791
01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:55.270
you know?
And then so we,

1792
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:59.530
we could took to get embedded in a daytime presence.

1793
01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:04.830
It was one slide five ws,
which,

1794
01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:08.560
which for the planning cycle it's really easy.
It's like a gun to be approved.

1795
01:52:08.561 --> 01:52:11.650
No problem.
And then if you wanted to mix it up,
that's,

1796
01:52:12.130 --> 01:52:14.980
that's where it was happening out on the streets with the guys that are walking

1797
01:52:14.981 --> 01:52:16.330
around using themselves as bait.

1798
01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:21.600
So we would bounce between going out with the Marines and going out with the

1799
01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.830
army.
And in both cases it was awesome.

1800
01:52:26.831 --> 01:52:30.580
But I really have a soft spot in my heart for the Marine Corps because my dad

1801
01:52:30.581 --> 01:52:34.030
was a marine.
But when you're in a marine patrol,

1802
01:52:36.190 --> 01:52:41.190
it's like a being part of a big huge beast that's just walking down the street

1803
01:52:42.521 --> 01:52:46.670
waiting for someone to bump into it and then they just turn and go after it.

1804
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:52.270
And were you guys setting up a bounding Overwatch's during that or were you just

1805
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:55.310
going on patrol with us?
We would go on,
but so,

1806
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:58.070
so the reason that we would go on patrol is so we could,

1807
01:52:58.130 --> 01:53:02.730
we could look for positions to put up sniper.
Overwatch is to,

1808
01:53:02.770 --> 01:53:04.260
and the sniper Overwatch is,

1809
01:53:04.261 --> 01:53:09.060
were to catch guys placing IED is out in the road.
Um,

1810
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:13.400
and they'd already gotten like three or four cars.

1811
01:53:13.401 --> 01:53:15.500
Some guys went out on a really good op.
And you know,

1812
01:53:15.501 --> 01:53:16.600
a guy that we both know and they,

1813
01:53:16.601 --> 01:53:20.330
they got two guys who are digging in our id and then there was another couple

1814
01:53:20.331 --> 01:53:23.720
where they got and they were,
they were having an impact for a little bit so,

1815
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.970
<v 0>well that meant a lot to the marine corps and the army when they are losing guys</v>

1816
01:53:28.971 --> 01:53:31.370
all the time to ids and then,

1817
01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:36.760
and you hardly ever do the IMD in placers actually get captured or killed.

1818
01:53:36.981 --> 01:53:40.700
So when they're getting laid out in the streets by snipers,
man,

1819
01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:42.980
those guys were excited about it

1820
01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:45.620
<v 2>and in their time and then then,
then you know,</v>

1821
01:53:45.621 --> 01:53:50.420
you had that whole thing going on with the populace because they be canned to

1822
01:53:50.421 --> 01:53:55.040
believe that every building had an American sniper in it,
which is a good segue.

1823
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:57.560
That's exactly what you're denying them.
Freedom of movement.

1824
01:53:57.561 --> 01:54:00.810
And they got to look over their shoulders before they placed,
you know,
one,

1825
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:03.890
one of those one five,
five rounds in the road.

1826
01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.130
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
So you get done with that,
how much longer after that,</v>

1827
01:54:08.131 --> 01:54:09.660
but you go to team three

1828
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:10.623
<v 2>immediately.</v>

1829
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:15.040
I got back from that and then checked out a trade at and checked into seal team

1830
01:54:15.041 --> 01:54:16.690
three from my platoon chief slop.

1831
01:54:18.090 --> 01:54:22.020
<v 0>And
that was an interesting ride.</v>

1832
01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.450
That troop you cause.

1833
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:27.780
So now I'm at seal team three almond tasking at bruiser and you're at seal team

1834
01:54:27.781 --> 01:54:32.520
three in your task unit.
And there's that,
that one,

1835
01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:34.890
there was some drama in that one.
And our factor,

1836
01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:38.700
I mean Lafe and I wrote about it in extreme ownership because this is the story

1837
01:54:38.701 --> 01:54:41.130
in extreme ownership of when the platoon,

1838
01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:45.000
one of the platoon commanders and the task unit commander did not,

1839
01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.140
couldn't get along.

1840
01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:51.380
And unfortunately they could not come to any kind of agreement of how to work

1841
01:54:52.651 --> 01:54:56.790
together.
In fact,
no.
The skipper said,
hey,

1842
01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:58.710
you guys got the weekend to figure out how to,

1843
01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:00.000
how are you going to deploy together?

1844
01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:03.560
And I think they could have come back and said,
look,
you know,
he,
he,

1845
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:06.810
he goes there,
I'll go somewhere else,
we'll,
we'll figure it out.

1846
01:55:07.170 --> 01:55:09.780
But they both came back in and kind of stuck to their guns,
which is no,

1847
01:55:09.781 --> 01:55:12.660
I don't want to work with him.
No,
I don't want to work with him.
And the,

1848
01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:16.770
the skipper fired in both actually.
Yeah.

1849
01:55:17.170 --> 01:55:19.270
<v 2>How was crazy?
That was a horrible,</v>

1850
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:22.690
like that had been brewing for a long time.

1851
01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:27.750
And so just that drama is so horrible to deal with.

1852
01:55:29.710 --> 01:55:34.330
Like Vic when they're both good guys.
Yeah.
But it just,

1853
01:55:34.331 --> 01:55:39.331
this drama brewed and then there was all this crazy on certainty and you know,

1854
01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:43.560
who's going to get fired,
what's going to happen as a result of that.

1855
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.210
<v 0>And so,
you know,
I'm,</v>

1856
01:55:46.211 --> 01:55:50.900
I'm glad to admiral made to call that he did and uh,
it,

1857
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:53.910
it worked.
And then we,

1858
01:55:53.970 --> 01:55:57.540
the guy you took over as the t you commit.

1859
01:55:57.541 --> 01:56:00.840
So we are AIC went over and became the OIC.
Oh,

1860
01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:05.670
I AICR assistant officer in charge became the OIC of the platoon.
Um,

1861
01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:09.960
there is an officer,

1862
01:56:09.961 --> 01:56:14.961
you read a counseling Chit for real early podcast that the new task unit

1863
01:56:16.711 --> 01:56:17.544
commander,

1864
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:22.470
the first thing he did the first day was sit down and give him a counseling.

1865
01:56:22.471 --> 01:56:25.800
Chet.
Yeah,
that's good leadership.
Yeah.
He's like,
Hey,

1866
01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:28.230
here's what you're doing wrong.
Here's what right looks like.

1867
01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:32.100
Laid it all out for him and uh,
and that was it.

1868
01:56:32.101 --> 01:56:35.070
And then he,
he was super direct,

1869
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:38.610
gave us our left and rights and then we were just like,
I was like,

1870
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:43.320
I remember thinking personally,
this is awesome.
Yeah,
he's strict,

1871
01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.520
but that I don't care if he,
if you tell me where my left and rights are,

1872
01:56:47.970 --> 01:56:52.200
especially we didn't know when that guy specialty because when you're coming in,

1873
01:56:52.210 --> 01:56:55.530
I've said this many times when you're coming into a situation where there's,

1874
01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:56.880
there's problems,
right?

1875
01:56:56.970 --> 01:57:00.180
Because there's definitely problems when the OIC and the task and the commander

1876
01:57:00.181 --> 01:57:02.880
just got fired.
There are problems.

1877
01:57:03.210 --> 01:57:05.880
You have to come in and kind of set down.

1878
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:08.250
You have to lay down the law a little bit.
It's not like,
you know,

1879
01:57:08.251 --> 01:57:11.160
if I roll into a task and they're doing great and the one of the guys had a

1880
01:57:11.161 --> 01:57:14.790
family emergency and he had to leave and I roll in and it's like,
okay,

1881
01:57:14.850 --> 01:57:17.430
I'm not going to lay down the law and a bunch of guys that are doing well,

1882
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:19.940
I'm going to go in there and say,
Hey,
I'm happy to be working with you guys.
And,

1883
01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:22.710
and then over time if there's things that need to be adjusted,
cool,

1884
01:57:22.770 --> 01:57:24.900
maybe they don't need to be adjusted,
but whatever.

1885
01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:29.100
It's different when you roll into a situation where things are not good and then

1886
01:57:29.101 --> 01:57:30.090
you have to lay down the law.

1887
01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:35.120
The other thing that's very important about what you just said is sometimes

1888
01:57:36.811 --> 01:57:39.930
people are,
sometimes from a leadership perspective,

1889
01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:43.080
you don't feel comfortable giving direction cause you're like,

1890
01:57:43.081 --> 01:57:46.010
well I don't really know what's going on.
And,
but it's,

1891
01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:50.520
it's important to think about times in your life or times in your career when

1892
01:57:50.521 --> 01:57:55.521
you didn't get good direction from the person you're working for and how just

1893
01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:58.260
you don't really know what's happening and you don't feel you don't.

1894
01:57:58.290 --> 01:57:59.870
You can't predict what's going to happen and so you,

1895
01:57:59.871 --> 01:58:03.720
you just feel kind of a little bit lost and then you think to yourself,
man,

1896
01:58:03.721 --> 01:58:06.270
I just wish the boss would just tell us what the hell he wants.

1897
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:08.070
And so that's kind of what happened there.
The boss,

1898
01:58:08.130 --> 01:58:10.160
the new boss comes in and says,
Hey,
here's what's going on in,

1899
01:58:10.161 --> 01:58:12.540
here's what we're going to do.
Hey you guy,
that's all jacked up.

1900
01:58:12.570 --> 01:58:16.860
Here's what you need to improve.
And everyone,
instead of what in your mind,

1901
01:58:16.861 --> 01:58:18.390
you might think,
hey,

1902
01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:21.660
I'm going to piss everyone off if I come in and lay down the law.

1903
01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:26.550
You got to remember that people have been wondering what the hell is going on

1904
01:58:26.551 --> 01:58:28.950
for six months for a year.
They don't know who's in charge.

1905
01:58:28.951 --> 01:58:30.030
Everything's a disaster.

1906
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:32.820
No decisions are going to make you come in and people go,
thank God.

1907
01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:35.150
Thank you for telling me what the hell you want.
I,

1908
01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:39.960
I'm tired of playing a guessing game every Monday morning about who's my boss

1909
01:58:39.961 --> 01:58:42.310
and what direction we're going into.
So that's,

1910
01:58:42.311 --> 01:58:44.950
that's an important part of remember now I am definitely,

1911
01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:46.240
there's a dichotomy of course,

1912
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:49.420
cause you can come in and you can start barking orders and everyone just says,

1913
01:58:49.421 --> 01:58:51.400
well who are you?
Where'd you come from?
You to know what you're talking about.

1914
01:58:51.401 --> 01:58:54.400
You haven't been here,
shut up.
And of course they won't say that to you.

1915
01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:57.940
They'll just undermine what you're trying to do and cause all kinds of,
you know,

1916
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.800
just,
just trying you,
serp you with whatever they can.
So that's a problem.

1917
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.570
But what I'm saying is there is a,
uh,

1918
01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:10.450
a happy medium and there are times when you lean towards being,

1919
01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:14.290
laying down the law and there's times where you lean towards being more loose

1920
01:59:14.530 --> 01:59:17.200
and you got to figure out where that's going to be depending on the situation

1921
01:59:17.201 --> 01:59:18.034
you're diving into.

1922
01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:22.250
<v 2>And so the advantage that the guy coming in ad was,</v>

1923
01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:26.180
he'd been watching this situation for a while and I knew everybody.

1924
01:59:26.181 --> 01:59:28.580
So sometimes when you come somewhere new,

1925
01:59:28.581 --> 01:59:33.581
it's maybe just listen before you start making some major adjustments or

1926
01:59:34.341 --> 01:59:39.110
something like that and,
but that would have just prolonged the anchor.

1927
01:59:39.170 --> 01:59:42.800
All of us were feelings and he came in,
he had a big brief.
It was,

1928
01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:46.720
and after that I felt like someone had taken 40 pounds on in my rucksack.
Yeah,

1929
01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:50.840
because you finally knew where you were going,

1930
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:54.830
who is in charge and what,
at least the near future meant,

1931
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:59.870
which I think you get rid of what the near future you get with.

1932
01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:02.600
Get rid of the certainty of the near future.
You get rid of who's in charge,

1933
02:00:02.630 --> 02:00:04.300
you get rid of what's going to happen up and

1934
02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:06.580
<v 0>you take all that away and you're just left uncertain.</v>

1935
02:00:06.610 --> 02:00:10.720
And that's a horrible feeling.
Yeah.
Probably the worst.

1936
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:17.290
Well,
yeah,
I think from a,
from a perspective of being led,
yeah.

1937
02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:20.890
Having no idea what's going to happen is the worst.
I,
I,

1938
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:26.390
I talk about that example of rats in a cage and how the rats on one side of the

1939
02:00:26.771 --> 02:00:31.030
cage,
they just get electrocuted randomly from the floor and,

1940
02:00:31.210 --> 02:00:33.160
but the electrocution isn't very strong.

1941
02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:36.430
The other side of the cage has a stronger elect,

1942
02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:38.620
electrocution shock,

1943
02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:42.880
but there's a little light that comes on that lets them know that you're about

1944
02:00:42.881 --> 02:00:46.870
to get shocked and rats prefer to know that they're going to get shocked even if

1945
02:00:46.871 --> 02:00:48.310
it's more often.
And even if it's stronger,

1946
02:00:48.311 --> 02:00:52.330
they just prefer to know that it's coming as opposed to be just randomly getting

1947
02:00:52.331 --> 02:00:54.130
shocked and you know why it's going to happen.

1948
02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:59.170
And that's basically where you were your task unit was because there was,

1949
02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:01.630
I mean it was like a public tool is like a public,

1950
02:01:01.631 --> 02:01:05.920
everyone kind of knew it was going on at least after about six months,

1951
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:09.430
you know,
I would say after all of us being at the team for about six months,

1952
02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:14.230
it was readily apparent,
that's for sure.
And you guys actually,
the,

1953
02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:19.090
one of the pieces of collateral damage of that was Mike Cirelli and Mike
Cirelli.

1954
02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.440
He,
he,

1955
02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:25.420
they didn't know what to do with him because I forget what the internal
conflict,

1956
02:01:25.421 --> 02:01:30.220
but there was internal conflict with Mike Cirelli and meaning that,

1957
02:01:30.370 --> 02:01:34.210
I don't even know what it was,
but,
so they said,
Hey Jocko,
you want this guy?

1958
02:01:34.211 --> 02:01:35.380
And I'm like,
affirmative.

1959
02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:40.850
And then you came up to me and I was like,
Eh,
you know this guy?
And you're like,

1960
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:42.680
yes,
he's awesome.
And I was like,
cool.

1961
02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:46.490
And then there was other people that were saying,
oh,
he's this and he's that.

1962
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:48.380
And of course the other people,
I'm like,
okay.

1963
02:01:48.381 --> 02:01:50.120
And I listened to him and then it was like thinking,
okay,

1964
02:01:50.121 --> 02:01:52.810
well that's why I think I asked you like,
Hey,
what's this guy's deal like?

1965
02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:57.640
He's awesome.
You're,
you're stoked.
And I was like,
cool,
good to go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,

1966
02:01:57.730 --> 02:02:01.520
and he was awesome.
He's obviously,
he still is.
Awesome.
And then you guys,

1967
02:02:01.521 --> 02:02:04.220
did that work up and

1968
02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:10.330
then you guys deployed over two while I was in Ramadi,
you guys were over in,
uh,

1969
02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:11.773
in Guam.

1970
02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:16.660
<v 2>Yeah.
So I tell you what if it,
if it hadn't been contracted,</v>

1971
02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:22.300
it was an amazing deployment.
Like we,
nobody got in trouble.

1972
02:02:22.330 --> 02:02:24.320
We did a lot of great stuff,
which,

1973
02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:29.350
which is a big problem in Guam guys just getting in trouble and uh,

1974
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.860
you know,
the,
the,
the problem was it was,
you guys were hearing in real time like,

1975
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.730
hey,

1976
02:02:36.730 --> 02:02:41.730
they just got the first Carl Gustaf kills in Ramadi and Hey,

1977
02:02:41.771 --> 02:02:43.150
this is happening.
And,

1978
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:48.750
and I remember one day we were in were in Thailand on an exercise of staying in

1979
02:02:49.421 --> 02:02:54.310
a five star hotel and guys are all Columbia and I,

1980
02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:58.780
I didn't get everybody at the side of the pool at the five star hotel.

1981
02:02:58.781 --> 02:03:01.780
And I'm like,
listen,
I want to be there too.

1982
02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:06.190
It's not going to happen.
We have to put the mission first.

1983
02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:10.720
Our mission is to be here and this is an amazing experience.

1984
02:03:10.721 --> 02:03:13.270
I guarantee you're going to remember for the rest of your life.

1985
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:18.310
You guys got to stop whining,
stop worrying about it.
And of course,

1986
02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:22.110
<v 0>guys always joke about the fact that when you're sitting in a sweaty Overwatch</v>

1987
02:03:22.111 --> 02:03:25.500
position that it's 118 degrees,
they're like,
okay,

1988
02:03:25.501 --> 02:03:27.720
we just spent a week in Thailand right now.
By the way.

1989
02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:31.460
<v 2>I know.
And then when they used to do that rip yeah.</v>

1990
02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:34.940
Where you'd go to Iraq and then halfway through come back to Guam.

1991
02:03:35.210 --> 02:03:36.710
The problem isn't Guam.
They'd be like,

1992
02:03:36.711 --> 02:03:39.970
guys would get back here and they wouldn't want to do any work.
Um,

1993
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.620
and they weren't,
they weren't focused on what was going on,
you know,

1994
02:03:42.621 --> 02:03:45.410
but then that's the mission has got to come first.

1995
02:03:45.411 --> 02:03:50.411
And the mission isn't always something that you can tell stories about.

1996
02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:56.180
But Hey,
I got to ride elephants.
I got to sit on a crocodile's back.
Uh,

1997
02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:57.930
I got great per diem of

1998
02:03:57.930 --> 02:04:01.840
<v 0>the,
neither of those.
I was gay.
It was interesting too,</v>

1999
02:04:01.841 --> 02:04:03.400
like going back to the workup,

2000
02:04:03.610 --> 02:04:07.300
it was a good contrast for my,

2001
02:04:08.650 --> 02:04:11.800
especially for my officers to kind of see,

2002
02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:15.280
like I'd be watching this unfold and you know,

2003
02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:19.120
I had stoner and leaf and I'd be,
you know,
we would talk about and be like,
Bro,

2004
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:21.970
this is what's going on fellas.
Look at this,
look what's happening here.

2005
02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:27.300
And it was a good contrast for them to see because it made it so obvious,

2006
02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:30.640
like why you have to work together.

2007
02:04:30.641 --> 02:04:34.930
Why these relationships we have inside the task and are so important why we
need,

2008
02:04:34.931 --> 02:04:38.610
if you have an issue,
you bring it up,
you bring it to me.

2009
02:04:38.730 --> 02:04:42.810
Why it's not going to freak me out.
Why we're going to talk about it.
Why,

2010
02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:44.250
you know,
Lafe always says,

2011
02:04:44.251 --> 02:04:47.190
and stone would have told you the same thing if lay fought like,
hey,

2012
02:04:47.191 --> 02:04:49.680
I'd like to try this a different way.
I'd be like,
cool,

2013
02:04:49.710 --> 02:04:53.060
how would you want to try it?
Go,
let's,
let's make it happen.
I don't care.
I don't,

2014
02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.470
I don't care what happens as long as it makes us win.

2015
02:04:55.890 --> 02:04:58.270
So that was a really cool for me.
Uh,

2016
02:04:58.290 --> 02:05:02.820
unfortunately it was not cool for you to be in a position where I could look and

2017
02:05:02.821 --> 02:05:06.660
use the leadership failures in that task unit.

2018
02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:09.060
And the other interesting thing was like,

2019
02:05:09.061 --> 02:05:11.130
you talk about those two guys who were like,
hey,
they're both good guys.

2020
02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:15.540
I've actually know both of those guys would be getting debrief to buy both of

2021
02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:15.930
them.

2022
02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:20.930
Like both of them would be telling me what the other person was doing and man,

2023
02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:26.340
you'd just be thinking guys,
instead of telling me,

2024
02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:31.710
go tell each other,
go talk to each other.
It didn't happen.

2025
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:36.860
The enemies outside the wire
not owns.
Yeah.

2026
02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:41.010
And what were you,
what was,
what were you,
when you're looking at my task unit,

2027
02:05:41.011 --> 02:05:43.020
what were you thinking?
When we're in a workup and stuff,

2028
02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:48.030
you guys are going to go to Iraq and we're,
we're going to go to pay calm.
Hmm.
No,

2029
02:05:48.110 --> 02:05:51.700
that's,
yeah,
that's fine.
I mean that's,
that is,

2030
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:55.680
we knew where we were laid out and how we were manned and it was all good to go.

2031
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:59.490
It wasn't like we were kicking cans.
Oh No.
It's like,
okay,

2032
02:05:59.491 --> 02:06:03.710
well that's how it's going to be.
Well,
they propose,
they made it,

2033
02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:08.340
the command made a proposal that this was early on.

2034
02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:11.100
As a matter of fact,
I was at Niland dirt,

2035
02:06:11.101 --> 02:06:12.300
so that was our first block of training.

2036
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:17.310
The command made a proposal that we kind of disassemble the task units and

2037
02:06:19.141 --> 02:06:24.141
reassemble them in a way that was more fair with regards to who's been to Iraq

2038
02:06:27.211 --> 02:06:28.044
and who's not.

2039
02:06:29.550 --> 02:06:34.200
And they made this proposal and so they made this proposal to us,

2040
02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:36.840
it was to me personally to that tends to task you to commanders.

2041
02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:37.733
As a matter of fact,

2042
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:40.590
hey that we can rearrange this thing and that way guys that haven't been can get

2043
02:06:40.591 --> 02:06:42.930
to go.
It was like the fair fairy was coming out.
Right.

2044
02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:47.250
And I mean I was just like,
there's no possible way,

2045
02:06:47.251 --> 02:06:52.251
but I went back to Ireland and I sat down with the platoon commanders and the

2046
02:06:53.251 --> 02:06:56.820
platoon chiefs and the the know my senior chief.
And I was like,
Hey,

2047
02:06:57.330 --> 02:07:00.630
here's what they're proposing to proposing that we could disassemble these task

2048
02:07:00.631 --> 02:07:02.010
units and we could reassemble them.

2049
02:07:02.011 --> 02:07:04.440
So that guys that haven't been to Iraq can go.

2050
02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:07.980
And then the other guys that had been to Iraq that have combat experience and

2051
02:07:07.981 --> 02:07:09.840
there's all those things you can layer on top of that.
Like,
Hey,

2052
02:07:10.050 --> 02:07:12.560
cause guys will say,
well I can't get promoted if I haven't been to it.

2053
02:07:12.561 --> 02:07:13.860
You know what I mean?
Like all these things,

2054
02:07:13.861 --> 02:07:17.010
they layer all these things on top of it because that's a crazy proposal if you

2055
02:07:17.011 --> 02:07:19.380
think about it.
But also if you think about it,

2056
02:07:19.410 --> 02:07:22.500
that's how much it means to guys that they want to go.

2057
02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:26.460
And so now this is 2005 so there were still guys that had been on,

2058
02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:28.860
shorty do over there that we're cycling back in,

2059
02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:33.330
never been to combat and they missed the 2003 2004 deployments.

2060
02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:34.770
And they're thinking,
Hey,

2061
02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:39.640
this is ridiculous and it's what you talked about earlier,
job dissatisfaction.

2062
02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:39.971
You know,

2063
02:07:39.971 --> 02:07:43.180
you've been in the teams for 12 years and you and there's a big war going on and

2064
02:07:43.181 --> 02:07:46.840
you don't get to go.
That is the kind of thing you have to consider and think,

2065
02:07:46.841 --> 02:07:48.370
how can we take care of the troops,
you know,

2066
02:07:48.371 --> 02:07:51.010
take care of the guys because we want it.

2067
02:07:51.010 --> 02:07:53.320
They all want to go to war and there's a war going on and yet we're going to

2068
02:07:53.321 --> 02:07:57.440
send them some of them to,
not war.
But I came,
I came back in Ireland,

2069
02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:01.990
I was said,
hey guys,
here's the proposals I recommend.

2070
02:08:03.070 --> 02:08:07.720
We,
we,
they also offered,
it's a competition,
it's a competition.

2071
02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:11.250
And it was really just a competition between my task unit and your task unit

2072
02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:14.440
because the other task unit,
they,

2073
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:19.540
they actually didn't,
that task unit didn't go to Iraq on the last deployment.

2074
02:08:19.541 --> 02:08:22.000
So they said,
look,
you guys get to go this time for sure.

2075
02:08:22.270 --> 02:08:25.610
And then it was between us two and they said,
we can either split up up,

2076
02:08:25.611 --> 02:08:29.680
I won't do that or make it a competition and the commanding officer,

2077
02:08:29.681 --> 02:08:32.710
we'll decide who's going to go based on performance.
And I told my guys,

2078
02:08:32.711 --> 02:08:34.780
I was like,
I say,

2079
02:08:34.810 --> 02:08:39.810
we go for performance and we do the best we can and we will probably crush

2080
02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:42.520
everyone and if we don't,

2081
02:08:42.730 --> 02:08:46.060
we don't deserve to go and we'll go do our job in Paco.

2082
02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:50.620
And of course all the guys were like,
hell yes.
That's what we did.
Sure.

2083
02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:54.270
<v 2>And,
and you know,
like when I was a CMC,</v>

2084
02:08:54.271 --> 02:08:56.940
a team five and I was doing my manning,

2085
02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:01.110
the hard fast rule was if you went to pay calm last time,

2086
02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:03.970
you are not going to pay calm again.
Yup.

2087
02:09:04.410 --> 02:09:07.980
And then so those guys could get a chance.
And then some of the,

2088
02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:11.070
some of the guys that went to Centcom went back.

2089
02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:15.540
But in the end,
when I'm building seal leaders,

2090
02:09:15.630 --> 02:09:17.970
I need guys that have been everywhere.

2091
02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:21.870
I need guys that have had the pay calm experience and understand they're mature

2092
02:09:21.871 --> 02:09:23.940
enough to go all the mission is first.

2093
02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:28.620
And then guys that had been exposed to combat so they know what that's all
about.

2094
02:09:30.210 --> 02:09:34.590
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
and,
and when you got done,</v>

2095
02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:36.600
so when you got done with that platoon chief Torque then where'd you go?

2096
02:09:36.810 --> 02:09:41.070
<v 2>So,
because I didn't,
because I was in PE calm,
I,</v>

2097
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:45.900
I made a deal with the new command master chief and I said,
hey,

2098
02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:50.250
I know I'm stepping down but I want to go to Centcom.

2099
02:09:50.490 --> 02:09:53.540
So can I stay here in the capacity of,
as,

2100
02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:57.820
as the OPS chief for one troop,
which was the,
and my,

2101
02:09:57.930 --> 02:10:02.930
the guy who was the OIC of my platoon who fleet Jack Riggins fleeted up to be

2102
02:10:03.691 --> 02:10:07.440
the,
uh,
um,
the troop commander.
And I'm like,
Hey,
can I,

2103
02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:11.850
can I stay and go to Centcom now?
Cause he was going to go to Centcom as his,
uh,

2104
02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:15.920
his,
his ops chief and they're like,
sure.
And it's,

2105
02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:18.850
I'm actually stepping down.
Tony did the same thing.
Yeah.

2106
02:10:19.410 --> 02:10:24.240
And then Tony and I both made senior chief and they're like,
hey,

2107
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:27.600
it's time for you to go home.
He's Eh,
and uh,

2108
02:10:27.690 --> 02:10:30.570
they sent us over to the senior enlisted academy and then we went over to seal

2109
02:10:30.571 --> 02:10:33.770
team seven to color,
which worked out

2110
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:36.650
<v 0>great.
We won't get into that later.</v>

2111
02:10:36.651 --> 02:10:41.651
And you know what w w the great part that you just mentioned is like a three

2112
02:10:42.081 --> 02:10:46.310
hour conversation,
which we don't,

2113
02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:51.311
aren't going to have right now because look the second part of your career or

2114
02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:54.950
the part that if,
yeah,
we'll get into this.
We'll do another one.
We'll just,

2115
02:10:54.951 --> 02:10:59.870
we'll just roll,
do another podcast.
We'll record it like tomorrow.
Um,

2116
02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:05.030
and that's going to follow you into Afghanistan.
Back to Iraq again.

2117
02:11:05.150 --> 02:11:09.500
More time,
more training,
more tours,
combat tours,

2118
02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:14.370
tours as senior enlisted tours as the command master chief towards as an ops

2119
02:11:14.371 --> 02:11:18.860
master chief.
I mean,
there's a lot of massive

2120
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:25.370
stuff to talk about from here on out.
So we'll do that.

2121
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:28.190
We'll record that tomorrow.
Good

2122
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:34.280
check.
Um,
Echo.
Yes.

2123
02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:39.500
While we're waiting for the next podcast,
I know,

2124
02:11:39.501 --> 02:11:44.501
have you probably have some suggestions on what we can do instead of just

2125
02:11:45.081 --> 02:11:47.660
sitting around and waiting?
There's probably some ways that we could get better.

2126
02:11:48.770 --> 02:11:53.450
Yes,
I do.
How do you have for the nations?
First thing is Jujitsu.
Jason Jujitsu.

2127
02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:57.170
Yes.
One stripe white belt.

2128
02:11:57.540 --> 02:12:00.740
He goes so and so we know.
And what,
what did,

2129
02:12:00.741 --> 02:12:02.660
what did it feel like when you got the bug?

2130
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:06.290
When did you get on the map for the first time?
Legitimately thinking.
All right,

2131
02:12:06.291 --> 02:12:09.020
I want to know what this is all about.
Okay.
So the,

2132
02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:13.610
the same master chief that taught us and go on.
Oh,
Steve Bailey,
Steve Bailey.

2133
02:12:13.611 --> 02:12:16.590
I trained with him for a little bit in Guam and then just got distracted.

2134
02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:19.630
I dug my teeth into a little bit,
but then,
uh,

2135
02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:24.750
like a year ago I started training out and he's counting.
Yeah.
And uh,

2136
02:12:25.130 --> 02:12:26.480
it was just awesome,

2137
02:12:26.481 --> 02:12:31.481
but I was like a spazz and so does death match.

2138
02:12:32.211 --> 02:12:34.450
It's like,
what am I supposed to like relax?
I'm like,

2139
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:38.120
why am I just supposed to lose only right now the 49,
49.

2140
02:12:38.210 --> 02:12:43.130
So everybody that asks,
I'm 51 can I started Jujitsu?

2141
02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:47.300
I'm 39.
Can I start to do to whatever age you are?

2142
02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:50.060
The answer is yes.
You can start to Jitsu.

2143
02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:54.770
We recommend that you calm down when you start drinking.

2144
02:12:55.970 --> 02:12:57.370
What's your real,
I wanted to roll with you.

2145
02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:02.060
What's your relaxed relaxation level right now?
If I was,

2146
02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:03.710
cause I haven't read in like six months,

2147
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:09.270
be I probably spazz out for a hot minute and then figure it out.

2148
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:13.550
But uh,
yeah,
because you're torn,

2149
02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:17.000
you don't know what you're doing,
but you just don't want to roll over and like,

2150
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:21.790
Oh,
here I have my arm.
Yeah.
Right.
So you just hang on to that triangle and uh,

2151
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:25.490
know that it's a,
it's a,

2152
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:30.500
it's easy situation.
It's a sweet situation that unfolds,
that you know,

2153
02:13:30.501 --> 02:13:32.070
is going to unfold,
that you know

2154
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:35.100
<v 4>is not the correct thing to do and there's no way you can stop yourself from</v>

2155
02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:38.100
doing it.
Like you just said,
you're someone's gonna arm lock you,

2156
02:13:38.250 --> 02:13:42.010
you know what's going to happen.
You could just go,
okay,
you know what,
um,

2157
02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.610
I'm just,
he's got me,
I'm going to let them.
But no,

2158
02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:49.020
you cannot stop yourself from guerrilla gripping your other hand and a hanging

2159
02:13:49.021 --> 02:13:52.650
on for dear life for an extra 12 seconds before you tap.

2160
02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:57.810
There's no possible way to overcome that.
It's just common.
So yeah,

2161
02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:00.630
you have to do that,
but hopefully you can make through that.

2162
02:14:00.631 --> 02:14:05.020
You can make it through that transition fairly quickly.
Yeah,

2163
02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:09.390
it was amazing for my kids to all kids.
It's a beautiful thing.

2164
02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:12.960
It's a beautiful thing for kids.
Yeah,
it seems like the spasming thing,

2165
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:16.260
even as you get it,
I mean obviously the,
it happens less and less,

2166
02:14:16.261 --> 02:14:21.261
but there'll be like momentary spazz situations even at like the top level where

2167
02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:23.910
you kind of got to stay calm.
I mean,

2168
02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:27.600
every once in a while I'll run into it where I got to stay conscious of it.
Like,

2169
02:14:27.630 --> 02:14:31.860
oh,
I see the danger coming and it's coming pretty quick.
You got to think,

2170
02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:33.130
well I and my sister,

2171
02:14:33.131 --> 02:14:36.390
I'll think through it and I'll be way more successful rather than like,

2172
02:14:36.391 --> 02:14:39.920
oh spazz through it.
So now I'm more tired and it's still coming kind of thing.

2173
02:14:39.921 --> 02:14:43.320
I hate to say this too because it's horrible for me to put this out there,

2174
02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:47.970
but there are times when you have to spazz to escape something.

2175
02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:53.010
Dean lister will,
if I do that,
he just like,
he,

2176
02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:56.540
he,
it's worth it.
Even if I get out,
it's worth it that I spazzed cause it,

2177
02:14:56.541 --> 02:14:59.700
it can make fun of me.
Oh good defense pass.

2178
02:15:00.810 --> 02:15:03.960
He's just making fun of me because we know we both know.

2179
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:07.380
The only reason that I got out of whatever he just did to me is because I kicked

2180
02:15:07.381 --> 02:15:11.580
and squirmed in spazzed out and he wasn't ready for it.

2181
02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:15.960
And then I got out.
Yeah,
the next one,
oh well it'll work out,

2182
02:15:15.961 --> 02:15:18.570
but a huge cost.
So there's like tooth,
this tooth,

2183
02:15:18.571 --> 02:15:23.571
little additional elements to a successful spazz escape or whatever.

2184
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:28.500
One you gotta be at least somewhat strong.
Like you can't like a,

2185
02:15:28.501 --> 02:15:33.210
a smaller person,
like spasming is less effective.
Even at a high level.

2186
02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:35.580
There's that.
And then when you're strong,

2187
02:15:35.581 --> 02:15:38.490
when you're a strong person and you spazz successfully,

2188
02:15:38.491 --> 02:15:41.010
you're way more tired and more tired.

2189
02:15:41.210 --> 02:15:45.780
So you get a person in where you put them in a spasming state like two,
three,

2190
02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:49.470
three times in a row.
Yeah,
no more.
Oh yeah.
You can't spend more than,

2191
02:15:49.710 --> 02:15:54.480
don't think you have a Mac spazz reps of foot after that year,
the next one,

2192
02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:56.230
there will be no spots left.
Yes.

2193
02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.280
Three legit spazzes that there's no done with spies left.

2194
02:15:59.281 --> 02:16:03.030
And which brings you back to went back early on as a white belt or something

2195
02:16:03.031 --> 02:16:06.000
like this where you know it's spazz fas,

2196
02:16:06.001 --> 02:16:10.590
fas and they feel the effects of three spasms in a row hate you and you're like,

2197
02:16:10.591 --> 02:16:14.550
Dang,
this is exhausting when you start,

2198
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:19.790
that's judges too as just spazzy Morris Bazzy and then it's like the opposite of

2199
02:16:21.271 --> 02:16:22.230
when,
you know,

2200
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:27.190
in the beginning there's these small moments where you don't spass yeah.

2201
02:16:27.330 --> 02:16:28.530
And then when you get better,

2202
02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:31.630
there's small moments when you do spazz and then when you're really good,

2203
02:16:31.631 --> 02:16:35.260
I mean very seldom do I make dean spazz.
Yeah,
I do.

2204
02:16:35.261 --> 02:16:39.810
Occasionally though it gets a little,
little,
little,
little crazy.
And you know,

2205
02:16:39.811 --> 02:16:43.870
I in a,
in a way to where that's why these smaller guys,

2206
02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:47.170
when they're super advanced,
I don't think they have response ever.

2207
02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:49.600
[inaudible] been unproductive for them.

2208
02:16:50.050 --> 02:16:54.410
Every attempted spazz is going to be like unsuccessful,
you know,
and,
and it,

2209
02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:56.020
it's a spectrum obviously.

2210
02:16:56.170 --> 02:17:00.850
So their whole thing is just thinking through the thing.

2211
02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:03.610
Andy Burke,
sure he does this,

2212
02:17:03.670 --> 02:17:08.670
his form of Spazz is like this silent spazz he pretends it's not happening.

2213
02:17:11.470 --> 02:17:14.030
But it is happening.
Covert camel class.

2214
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:18.130
He's doing these like in little movements and it's,

2215
02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:21.760
there's only one technique that it could truly be called.
That's a spazz,

2216
02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:25.480
but he acts like it wasn't.
He's real cool.
He's real cool.

2217
02:17:25.481 --> 02:17:30.130
He's acting like that was just like a defense that he knows.
I'm on to you,

2218
02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:33.430
Andy Burke.
I know what's up.
That's a good tip.
I want to look out for it.

2219
02:17:33.431 --> 02:17:35.170
I don't know if I've ever made Andy Spazz,

2220
02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:37.480
but you know I'm going to be looking out for it nonetheless.

2221
02:17:37.510 --> 02:17:38.980
When you're in Jujitsu,
we all need a geek.

2222
02:17:39.550 --> 02:17:43.210
If we're doing gete and I'm not saying you have to do,
you should do.
I think.

2223
02:17:43.330 --> 02:17:47.680
Yeah,
she recommended.
Yeah.
Do both.
That's the recommended boat.

2224
02:17:47.770 --> 02:17:51.940
If you trained Geeky Nogi both.
Oh yeah.
The place we were training at.

2225
02:17:51.970 --> 02:17:54.580
They did both.
Yeah.
So one night was no gay.

2226
02:17:54.581 --> 02:17:59.500
The other night was g was awesome origin gies.
They're awesome.
Oh,

2227
02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:01.900
interesting.
So you're already in the game.
So some people,

2228
02:18:01.901 --> 02:18:06.190
they may or may not be looking,
hey,
what kind of,
Gee should I get?
There you go.

2229
02:18:06.191 --> 02:18:07.420
Just like daisy Gardner said,

2230
02:18:07.470 --> 02:18:11.140
forging Geek hundred percent best factually by the lacing gardener with the

2231
02:18:11.141 --> 02:18:13.750
origin g plug,
common straight off the top ropes.

2232
02:18:14.370 --> 02:18:18.010
He just pulled that out of nowhere.
He's like,
you've got a trache and Nokia.

2233
02:18:18.011 --> 02:18:21.630
And by the way,
I have happened in the origin gate,

2234
02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:26.410
which is the finest g in America.
And many people say the finest in the world.

2235
02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:31.750
I say that.
I said that too.
And it is made in America by the way.
Um,
so yeah.

2236
02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:35.650
Anyway,
when you get,
you go to origin main.com,
that's where you get it.

2237
02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:41.050
You can also get other stuff like rash guards.
Sure.
Gnocchi.
Yeah.
Uh,

2238
02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:44.470
if your name is Echo Charles,
no,
I shouldn't say that.

2239
02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.720
If your name is not Jocko Willink,

2240
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:52.110
you can get joggers because I don't look like normal.

2241
02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:58.540
I don't,
I don't know what to say.
I look,
you don't match.

2242
02:18:58.570 --> 02:19:02.830
I don't,
I don't feel match joggers or not for me.
Is it a,
what is that?

2243
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:07.600
But you just don't match.
So here,
this is what actually,
this is what it is.
Okay.

2244
02:19:07.710 --> 02:19:12.130
Jogger INA with joggers are pretty skinny.
Okay.
Yeah,

2245
02:19:12.131 --> 02:19:15.910
they're so their skinny jeans,
sweatpants kind of tapered.
We're not kind of,

2246
02:19:15.911 --> 02:19:19.300
they're really tapered little bit of a,
what do you call it,
like a drop crotch.

2247
02:19:19.301 --> 02:19:22.060
A little bit for like a lot of Rumi in the hips area kind of thing.

2248
02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:24.250
If you think they're functional.
Yes.

2249
02:19:24.251 --> 02:19:27.980
But I think the big push is a style thing.

2250
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:30.020
Cause there's like skinny jeans and all this stuff.

2251
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:33.950
So it's kind of like a functional thing.
Yes.
But it's a style thing.

2252
02:19:34.550 --> 02:19:37.010
That's the part you don't match with any,

2253
02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:41.280
especially anything that says skinny or thin or trim fit or what bro,

2254
02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:43.580
that's not you.
That's somebody else.
So yeah,

2255
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:48.210
that's not going to mess with you at all.
In fact,
even to,
you know,

2256
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:51.010
people have like real fitted jeans does.
Yes.

2257
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:55.610
Like real fitted tight.
I'm not gonna say that say fitted to,

2258
02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:00.260
you should not do that either because that's not,
it's just not you.

2259
02:20:00.261 --> 02:20:04.940
But the weird thing is the world changes.
Right?
The fashion changes.

2260
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:08.160
I just keep wearing the same stuff.
Yeah.

2261
02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:12.110
At some point is what I were going to come back.
We'll fashion wise maybe,

2262
02:20:12.111 --> 02:20:16.010
but maybe not what I wear.
This is the thing,
I think what I wear doesn't,

2263
02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:18.890
it doesn't say,
hey,
you can't say,
Hey,

2264
02:20:18.891 --> 02:20:20.840
this guy's wearing a tee shirt and a pair of jeans.

2265
02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:26.800
You could wear a tee shirt and a pair of jeans in 95019601970 never,

2266
02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:27.923
never go out of style.

2267
02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:32.450
Never goes out of style and actually even to to be more precise since years.

2268
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:33.950
You don't go for fashion at all.

2269
02:20:33.951 --> 02:20:37.460
You go for like this functionality kind of situation.
So if,

2270
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:41.790
if anything you do is like fashion,
which I know we have a real problem,

2271
02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:44.960
the fashion stuff in your past,
like maybe hairstyles,
et cetera.

2272
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:48.680
That's why if you see old pictures of the Jocko with his hair,
you'd be like,

2273
02:20:48.681 --> 02:20:51.860
they'll be like,
ah,
I,
you know,
this kind of the thing that's the,

2274
02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:55.190
that's the guy that Jason was talking about earlier.
That's me.

2275
02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:59.650
Like we will like that.
Like,
Hey,
we were in the teams were hammered it home hair,

2276
02:20:59.970 --> 02:21:00.800
cool.

2277
02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:05.800
Push the envelope as long as I could get it and know the fashion thing to look

2278
02:21:07.071 --> 02:21:09.770
good.
But your clothing wise,
you'll never go fashion.

2279
02:21:09.771 --> 02:21:12.860
So you'll never go out of style because since the fashion of the thing that

2280
02:21:12.861 --> 02:21:16.110
revolves and goes out of style,
origin,
jeans,
uh,

2281
02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:21.020
I got like the final kind of cut and everything,
you know,
they're legit.

2282
02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:26.060
So that's another thing there.
It's not fun.
It's not a fashion thing.

2283
02:21:26.390 --> 02:21:31.130
Right.
Their origin jeans,
well,
they're not mutually exclusive either.

2284
02:21:31.250 --> 02:21:35.990
So functionality are strong,
they're flexible,
they're durable,

2285
02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:38.900
they don't go to stuff that stuff's not going on a style and sure it's not.

2286
02:21:39.130 --> 02:21:41.330
So there we go.
Origin genes.

2287
02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:46.920
We're are in production with origin genes in production at this time.

2288
02:21:47.390 --> 02:21:49.340
So check the website,

2289
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:54.370
origin main.com if you want to get some jeans or if your name is not Jocko

2290
02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:56.780
Willink,
you can get pair of joggers.
The joggers are good.

2291
02:21:56.781 --> 02:22:00.830
That's the thing where I,
I wasn't done for the joggers.
Pete told me this,

2292
02:22:00.831 --> 02:22:05.720
he opened my eyes open,
my little like mind or whatever I put them on.
I was like,

2293
02:22:05.721 --> 02:22:09.380
Dang,
these are comfortable.
But man,
they're skinny.
They're thin,
you know,
they're,

2294
02:22:09.410 --> 02:22:10.760
they're,
they're tight.

2295
02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:14.690
They had a specific look that I wasn't very accustomed to but,

2296
02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:17.240
and Pete's noticed it.
He was like,
yeah,
they're like,

2297
02:22:17.241 --> 02:22:20.030
you know you gotta he's like Jocko that they're probably not for Jocko,

2298
02:22:20.031 --> 02:22:23.430
but you pull them off.
That's what Pete said to me.
Oh Man,

2299
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:27.850
I hope he was like being like honest with it.
But yeah.

2300
02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:30.930
Ever since then I was like,
okay,
maybe I can do this.
So it only warm at camp.

2301
02:22:31.470 --> 02:22:33.450
So it was like,
oh,
I might not wear these at home,

2302
02:22:33.690 --> 02:22:36.750
but when I'm at Camp and then at Camp I was like,
Dang,
these are good too.

2303
02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:40.110
And when you jog they're way better than regular sweatpants.
And I'm like,
oh,

2304
02:22:40.111 --> 02:22:40.800
these are good.

2305
02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.680
And they're like super comfortable too because you know the cotton that they use

2306
02:22:43.681 --> 02:22:47.370
or whatever.
And then I'd where I'm at home and that's all I would wear now.

2307
02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:51.840
I kind of switched over to that whole thing to for real,

2308
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:54.810
hey man,
how are your pockets?
Are the pockets,

2309
02:22:54.811 --> 02:22:57.690
all kinds of life changing things happen on this podcast?

2310
02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:01.740
One of them is Echo Charles switching to joggers be noted.

2311
02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:06.690
We pockets.
Like what for like functionality or like for my everyday carry.

2312
02:23:06.691 --> 02:23:09.300
So I'm going down to the store and the joggers.
Yeah,

2313
02:23:09.301 --> 02:23:12.030
I would say like any other sort of sweatpants situation.

2314
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:17.010
Hidden pockets on either side,
right?
Like no regular sweatpants.

2315
02:23:17.011 --> 02:23:21.060
Don't have pockets bro.
All the kind you're talking about.
I'm talking about,

2316
02:23:21.061 --> 02:23:25.070
you know like the SGM coach from 1979 they're not done.

2317
02:23:25.260 --> 02:23:27.390
They have pockets for sure.
I got to tell you,

2318
02:23:27.391 --> 02:23:29.870
I saw those boots online and I'm pretty excited.
Right.

2319
02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:34.170
I opened the gun mentioning that now we're,
we're making them,

2320
02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:37.910
we're making them and yeah,
they're awesome.
You have a pair of those too.

2321
02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:41.160
Hey Man,
you got your one,

2322
02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:46.220
your one like one degree separation from getting all the new stuff to where

2323
02:23:46.321 --> 02:23:49.680
you're at really.
Cause it feels like one 80 and you know,

2324
02:23:49.681 --> 02:23:54.390
I'm over here to looking online at stuff anyway.
Also Moke Moke train Jason,

2325
02:23:54.391 --> 02:23:58.230
we talked to her earlier.
Recipe morning recipe.
Okay.

2326
02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:02.520
So I get up in the morning,
brew 20 ounces of coffee.

2327
02:24:02.521 --> 02:24:05.400
I grind up the beans,
do it in the French Press.

2328
02:24:05.730 --> 02:24:09.540
I add a little bit of Stevia to sweeten it,

2329
02:24:09.541 --> 02:24:13.980
but it's not going to spike my insulin.
Then I put some coconut milk in.

2330
02:24:13.981 --> 02:24:17.760
There were no coconut oil,
grass fed butter,

2331
02:24:17.761 --> 02:24:20.580
about a tablespoon is at some MCT oil,

2332
02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:23.700
a scoop of vanilla milk.

2333
02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:28.560
I hit that with a stick blender or did that little hit her.

2334
02:24:28.650 --> 02:24:32.730
I do not have to eat until like one or two in the afternoon.

2335
02:24:32.731 --> 02:24:36.090
I get all my fat in early in the morning so I ain't gotta stress getting good

2336
02:24:36.091 --> 02:24:39.990
fat in and that's it.
That's awesome.
That's an advanced take.

2337
02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:44.180
Are the kids on the block chain?
They are and uh,
is it,

2338
02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:47.280
have you tried strawberry milk and strawberry warrior kids strawberry?
No,

2339
02:24:47.281 --> 02:24:51.000
we haven't.
We've been doing the chocolate hot chocolate.
Yeah,
the hot chocolates.

2340
02:24:51.001 --> 02:24:53.700
Awesome.
I didn't know iris has been making the pancakes.
Oh yeah,

2341
02:24:56.010 --> 02:24:59.700
she's just using it and mixing straight up pancakes because axel was talking

2342
02:24:59.701 --> 02:25:02.670
about it the other day.
There was a guy in London who was like,
yeah,

2343
02:25:02.671 --> 02:25:05.940
more pancakes.
I was like,
techniques,
a good idea.
So it just added them.

2344
02:25:05.941 --> 02:25:10.440
I basically replaced like us portion,
a percentage of the pancake mix with milk.

2345
02:25:10.690 --> 02:25:11.523
Do it.

2346
02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:14.610
I don't know what pancakes are even made of because I haven't had them in so

2347
02:25:14.611 --> 02:25:16.740
long.
It's just raw.
Hey Bro,

2348
02:25:16.770 --> 02:25:19.650
that's on you and you're kind of missing out on that one cause it did.

2349
02:25:19.651 --> 02:25:24.160
They work out really good.
Yeah,
we're on that.

2350
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:25.023
<v 0>We're on mint.</v>

2351
02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:28.630
I'm on mint and I'm actually in this whole deal now when I'm having both men,

2352
02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:30.280
peanut butter,
I don't really,

2353
02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:34.540
I don't really like the flavor of Vanilla as I've mentioned on here so I don't

2354
02:25:34.541 --> 02:25:38.500
have that.
But the strawberry to the warrior kids,
strawberry milk,

2355
02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:41.830
which Brian is working on the adult strawberry milk,

2356
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:46.750
<v 2>the vanilla,
like I'm not a big vanilla plan either,
but it just mixes so well.</v>

2357
02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:50.350
Yeah.
So like when Iris is making smoothies,

2358
02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:52.150
the vanilla milk in there,

2359
02:25:52.151 --> 02:25:55.060
I put it in my coffee because of the mint chocolate chip doesn't work

2360
02:25:56.980 --> 02:26:01.720
cause it's my favorite like okay I get to have dessert and that's exactly what

2361
02:26:01.721 --> 02:26:04.150
it is.
It scratches that itch when it comes along.

2362
02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:07.620
<v 0>See that's the thing,
man.
I went out last night,
I had a legit stake,</v>

2363
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:12.830
legit at Raglan ob and I still was needed a little something.

2364
02:26:15.870 --> 02:26:18.210
I need a little something because they sell this thing at Ragland called the

2365
02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:18.721
illegal,

2366
02:26:18.721 --> 02:26:23.721
which is a giant chocolate chip cookie cooked in a cast iron thing.

2367
02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:28.020
It's massive in the nave put vanilla ice cream on it,

2368
02:26:28.021 --> 02:26:31.380
which is the only time I like vanilla and the vanilla ice cream is all melting

2369
02:26:31.381 --> 02:26:33.150
is just ridiculous.

2370
02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:36.560
But obviously that's not part of Graham.

2371
02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:40.980
So I left Raglan ob without eating an illegal and I went home and I'm like,

2372
02:26:40.981 --> 02:26:43.500
I still need some kind of a little hitter.

2373
02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:48.390
So I went peanut butter and went peanut butter milk and I just did.

2374
02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:53.220
I did it like a scoop and a half with a half of Shaker of water.

2375
02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:58.200
I drink that thing.
It was so good.
I was sitting there saying,

2376
02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:02.490
this is a milkshake.
If this is a milkshake,
it's freaking ridiculous there.

2377
02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:04.310
Yes sir.
And the added protein,
this stuff,

2378
02:27:04.311 --> 02:27:07.440
forget that for the end and don't forget the probiotic.

2379
02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:11.880
<v 2>Remember that microbiome.
It's true.
Yeah.</v>

2380
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:15.210
We haven't even gotten to your whole health scenario cause what'd you say?

2381
02:27:15.211 --> 02:27:18.630
You're 50 years old.
51 49,
49,
49 50 this year.

2382
02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:21.630
And you're getting after it.
I feel great.

2383
02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:26.660
You feel awesome walking around at like one 57 and in before I had,

2384
02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:29.720
you know,
before I adjusted my diet and everything else,

2385
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:34.870
one 93 and they had all kinds of inflammation and everything hurt just crappy

2386
02:27:36.481 --> 02:27:38.040
and now it's all just dialed in.

2387
02:27:38.490 --> 02:27:43.110
<v 0>Yeah.
I remember when you were first going down that path because our wives were</v>

2388
02:27:43.111 --> 02:27:47.220
hiking and you and I met somewhere and we were just talking about like you were

2389
02:27:47.221 --> 02:27:49.590
starting down this path and you were coming home from deployment

2390
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:52.660
<v 2>to doesn't do it for you.
This is my last deployment.</v>

2391
02:27:52.661 --> 02:27:54.730
I don't have deployments to go on and get back in shape,

2392
02:27:54.731 --> 02:27:56.780
so I'm going to have to stick with it.

2393
02:27:59.110 --> 02:28:02.320
And um,
yeah.
So those supplements,

2394
02:28:02.321 --> 02:28:04.420
joint warfare twice a day,

2395
02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:09.750
two in the morning and two in the evening that the turmeric is amazing.
Yup.

2396
02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:15.010
Yup.
Krill oil in the morning every morning.
And then usually,
uh,
uh,

2397
02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:17.290
anytime I'm going to do something that disciplined go,

2398
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:22.190
<v 0>yeah.
Jp said the other day</v>

2399
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:25.370
<v 4>when he took the discipline go,
he could,
he could see people's thoughts</v>

2400
02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:29.810
anyways,
pick,
get all this stuff@aoriginmain.com sorry,

2401
02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:32.900
just taking a really long time.
It's all good.
And also Jack was the door.

2402
02:28:32.930 --> 02:28:36.790
It's called Jocko store.
So Jocko store.com me and,

2403
02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:40.370
and uh,
yeah,
they say if you want to represent discipline equals freedom.

2404
02:28:40.371 --> 02:28:45.050
This is where you can get you shirts,
hoodies,
hats,
trucker hats,
flex fit,

2405
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:50.090
flex man.
I can go either way,
but within,
yes.
Fence,
Walker,

2406
02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.700
no,
both sides.
Right.

2407
02:28:53.250 --> 02:28:56.700
What do you call it when you can adapt and adjust one?

2408
02:28:56.701 --> 02:28:59.300
Either way bill and it's got to have a role in it though.

2409
02:28:59.301 --> 02:29:01.730
I'm not a flat bill box.
Yeah.

2410
02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:08.080
That's actually strange coming from a California person because that's like in

2411
02:29:08.121 --> 02:29:12.710
the last couple of decades or something.
That was not,
yeah,
check either way.

2412
02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:15.560
There you go.
Jocko store.
That's where you can get them.
Or sorry,
Jacqueline,

2413
02:29:15.561 --> 02:29:18.950
store.com I'm also women's stuff on there as well.
Yeah.

2414
02:29:18.951 --> 02:29:23.020
If you want to represent while on the path,
that's where you go.
It's good.

2415
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:25.520
Also Jocko white tea.

2416
02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:30.560
If you're dead lifting and you're like tired of your like 500 pound deadlift,

2417
02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:32.630
tired recharge,
which yeah,

2418
02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:37.900
I can see how you'd be tired of that and you want it to go up to 8,000 pounds

2419
02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:43.570
Jocko white tea and it happens to tastes good and it happens to be USD organic

2420
02:29:44.601 --> 02:29:48.770
certified organic organic.
Yes.
That's a good one.

2421
02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:52.810
Now that adds a kind of a little spin because people used to say to me,

2422
02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:56.540
did you ever picture that you'd be making tea?
And,
and it's kind of funny,

2423
02:29:56.600 --> 02:29:59.360
you know,
and I'd be like,
yeah,
whatever.
But now it's like next level.

2424
02:29:59.361 --> 02:30:02.180
Did you ever picture that you'd be making organic tea?

2425
02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:04.690
That is kind of a different thing were in it.

2426
02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:10.060
Maybe I'll be wearing joggers soon as the whole world going crazy if you don't

2427
02:30:11.511 --> 02:30:14.870
subscribe to this podcast,
which is shocking to me.

2428
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:19.990
But now we have reports from the field of people that listened to 167 podcasts

2429
02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:23.480
and haven't subscribed to it.

2430
02:30:24.290 --> 02:30:26.870
And so now echo has made it clear that you need to subscribe.
Also,

2431
02:30:26.871 --> 02:30:29.510
don't forget about the,
the warrior kid podcast.

2432
02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:32.660
You were on the warrior king podcasts.
Ted's kids.

2433
02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:35.810
Have the kids memorized them yet?
They love it.
I mean,

2434
02:30:35.930 --> 02:30:39.590
pretty much I been lagging.

2435
02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:41.120
I don't get them out as much as I can.

2436
02:30:41.121 --> 02:30:44.120
Part of it is because I liked really like doing those stories from Uncle Jake

2437
02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:49.370
and they take a little bit more time and so I'm need to invest the time,

2438
02:30:49.700 --> 02:30:53.960
the cute,
I should just do the Q and A's as well.
But anyways,
warrior kid podcast,

2439
02:30:53.961 --> 02:30:58.910
if you want to get your kid on the pot on the path
and what you,

2440
02:30:58.911 --> 02:31:03.470
what you and I were talking about earlier of how your kids just don't really

2441
02:31:03.471 --> 02:31:08.000
want to listen to you.
They listen to Uncle Jake.
Yeah,

2442
02:31:08.001 --> 02:31:12.650
absolutely.
Just listen to uncle Jake.
Absolutely.
I had an another master chief,

2443
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:16.280
uh,
east coast master chief come out and came to the gym and he's like,
Bro.

2444
02:31:16.281 --> 02:31:18.350
And I never,
I didn't know,
you know,
he's just like another guy.

2445
02:31:18.351 --> 02:31:20.070
He's coast guard that I didn't know.
And he's

2446
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:23.400
<v 0>like,
he's like,
Bro,
your book,</v>

2447
02:31:23.460 --> 02:31:27.570
your little warrior kid books.
He said,
you got my kid,

2448
02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:29.220
he's 11 years old.

2449
02:31:29.430 --> 02:31:33.600
Everything I did for 11 years to get them to do pushups and pull ups failed.

2450
02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:38.160
He goes,
he read that book.
I,
he's like,
I can't thank you because it's awesome.

2451
02:31:38.670 --> 02:31:41.500
And I was like,
Dang,
it's 100% true.
If you're,

2452
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:45.390
your kids are not going to listen to you as much as you want them to,

2453
02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:49.500
they will listen to uncle Jake for some reason.
Uncle Jake,
we'll,

2454
02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:53.670
we'll take it home for him.
I listened to Uncle Jake.
I love those books.
Yeah,

2455
02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:57.660
I'm taking them just reading the books.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

2456
02:31:58.010 --> 02:32:02.850
I got to fix that.
Oh,
here's something I could do better.
Yeah,
true.
It's,

2457
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:04.830
it's,
yeah,
it's uncle Jake.

2458
02:32:04.890 --> 02:32:08.550
Uncle Jake is who uncle Jake has good information.

2459
02:32:08.551 --> 02:32:13.050
He's kind of everybody's uncle Jake
and people,

2460
02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:17.040
people will say like,
oh,
aren't you know your Uncle Jake to me?
And I'm like,

2461
02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:20.630
I am so not uncle Jake.
If I was uncle Jake,
I'd be so much cooler.
Well,

2462
02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:21.570
Jake is my legit,

2463
02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:25.830
I'm just a little warrior kid over here and trying to turn a learn to try to get

2464
02:32:25.831 --> 02:32:30.690
on the path.
That's the way it is.
And where your kid soap,

2465
02:32:30.750 --> 02:32:35.070
you can get that.
Irish oce,
Irish oaks,
ranch.com.
Speaking of warrior kids,

2466
02:32:35.071 --> 02:32:39.480
Aiden's making soap on his farm and he wants you to stay clean.

2467
02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:44.030
What about one of my kids said today,
uh,

2468
02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:49.590
like comment and subscribe.
I was like,
oh my God,
wait,

2469
02:32:49.591 --> 02:32:51.630
who said that?
Just one of my kids were,

2470
02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:54.630
I don't know what we're talking about something you don't own.
Some Instagram,

2471
02:32:54.631 --> 02:32:55.350
this and that.

2472
02:32:55.350 --> 02:32:58.440
And then one of my kids is like light comment and sort of subscribe and

2473
02:32:58.441 --> 02:33:01.590
subscribe that's going up there.

2474
02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:04.110
If I start saying that you get the joggers out,

2475
02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:08.690
we're already making organic key for some reason,
which is just crazy.

2476
02:33:08.690 --> 02:33:10.280
That's a good thing.
It's just you.
I know it.

2477
02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:12.150
This tastes good and it's good for you.

2478
02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:16.170
So these are all things they just sound kind of lighthearted compared to your,

2479
02:33:16.600 --> 02:33:21.590
you know,
your whole anyway also.
Yes,
Youtube.
By the way,
that's where they stayed.

2480
02:33:21.591 --> 02:33:24.150
That's where you can run into these videos.
Where this,
cause my daughter,

2481
02:33:24.151 --> 02:33:27.150
sometimes we'll watch a little youtube videos and that's what they'll say,

2482
02:33:27.151 --> 02:33:30.720
like comment and subscribe,
just repetitive there programming,

2483
02:33:30.990 --> 02:33:34.720
programming the children,
they get it.
They get it.
Oh yeah.
So Jackson,

2484
02:33:34.750 --> 02:33:35.281
I can say that,

2485
02:33:35.281 --> 02:33:38.700
but we do have a youtube channel and you're basically right now saying subscribe

2486
02:33:38.701 --> 02:33:41.620
to the Youtube Channel and so want,

2487
02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:45.210
Jason says you should like the youtube channel.
You should like it.

2488
02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:48.330
And then I'm over here saying you should comment like comment,

2490
02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:58.320

2493
02:34:02.401 --> 02:34:04.670

2494
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:08.100
That's up to you if tell you to like it.
If you want to have fun,

2495
02:34:08.130 --> 02:34:13.130
you can go to the Youtube Channel Jocko podcast and you can look at the people

2496
02:34:14.010 --> 02:34:17.010
that attack the down votes.

2497
02:34:19.170 --> 02:34:23.720
<v 4>So there'll be no,
we don't have many downvotes which is I guess cool.
Yeah,</v>

2498
02:34:23.890 --> 02:34:27.880
it's crazy.
Or whatever it thumbs down.
People get mad.
They get mad.

2499
02:34:28.450 --> 02:34:31.800
Goodness of Isis terrorist.
Just gate.
Who?

2500
02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:35.450
The 13 isis members that gave this a down vote.

2501
02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:40.630
You will rot email.
So thanks for having my back there.
They also liked that.

2502
02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:44.820
Liked it.
Let everyone know that echo looks jacked,
Echo,
look to whatever.

2503
02:34:45.130 --> 02:34:47.590
There's a video that was just released.
Um,

2504
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:51.130
what's the most recent video you just did that just got normal face?

2505
02:34:51.310 --> 02:34:54.940
Normal face reaction.
One overreaction.
You released the video.

2506
02:34:54.970 --> 02:34:58.250
You are not in the video but people were saying that they could feel that you

2507
02:34:58.251 --> 02:34:59.850
were jack just from watching Tiffany.

2508
02:35:01.310 --> 02:35:04.840
So call it goes jack psychological warfare.

2509
02:35:04.841 --> 02:35:08.440
You can get that on iTunes,
Google play,
MP,
three platforms.

2510
02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:12.190
You think you might have a moment of weakness when your day to day life press

2511
02:35:12.191 --> 02:35:15.310
play and you'll get pushed through that moment of weakness.

2512
02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:20.140
But Jocko by the one by me,
we'll say spotted.

2513
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:23.980
That's better.
Yeah.
Because some people,
they're not in the mood to get pushed.

2514
02:35:23.981 --> 02:35:27.320
Pragmatically reasoned with.
Yes.

2515
02:35:28.660 --> 02:35:31.570
Adequate reason where he could also speak in a reason.

2516
02:35:31.571 --> 02:35:35.620
When you want to improve your home gym,
I dunno,

2517
02:35:35.650 --> 02:35:36.920
maybe even your commercial gym,

2518
02:35:36.921 --> 02:35:41.921
you're 24 fitness Cottonelle but on att.com/jocko get yourself more kettle bells

2519
02:35:42.731 --> 02:35:45.910
like me got the storm trooper trooper one by the way.
Oh,

2520
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:50.110
you're going to break out some star wars nerd stuff over here bro.
Yeah,

2521
02:35:50.111 --> 02:35:50.860
you ready?

2522
02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:55.780
So Jenga fat was the guy that they used for,
they're like,
oh,

2523
02:35:55.781 --> 02:35:58.960
you're the perfect warrior.
We're going to make all the clones based on you.

2524
02:35:59.290 --> 02:36:02.170
And I believe that his deal he made with those people,

2525
02:36:02.171 --> 02:36:04.750
it's like you're going to give me one of the clones back then I'm going to raise

2526
02:36:04.751 --> 02:36:09.370
as my son who turned out to be bubble fat.
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah.
Wait,
wait.

2527
02:36:09.371 --> 02:36:13.070
So you're taking your letting me know because I messed that up.
I think Jane,

2528
02:36:13.470 --> 02:36:15.380
yeah.
Tune you up.
And then on the last podcast,

2529
02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:20.000
if you guys are talking about it again,
is there,
is there books for that?

2530
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:25.630
Because you're more positive.
Nerd Jason.
Oh Hey.

2531
02:36:26.140 --> 02:36:30.510
I played dungeons and dragons when I was in high school.
So yes.
Yeah,

2532
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.640
absolutely.
And I can be open about it today.

2533
02:36:33.641 --> 02:36:38.641
I was horrified to tell you when I was in high school and dragons or that gone

2534
02:36:39.761 --> 02:36:42.070
out right now.
Like I don't care.

2535
02:36:43.700 --> 02:36:47.020
She yelled and you got all kinds of you.
You got all kinds of like little nerd.

2536
02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:51.850
Uh,
no science fiction.
Nerdism right?
Yeah.
Hey,
enjoy science fiction.

2537
02:36:51.851 --> 02:36:54.710
It's a lot of fun.
There you go.
That's cool.
We're up.

2538
02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.670
My younger brother who's a tattoo artist up in San Clemente,

2539
02:36:57.671 --> 02:37:00.730
he has a complete storm trooper costume.

2540
02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:03.700
Do you got the data by the way?

2541
02:37:03.790 --> 02:37:08.540
Are you in the five Oh is it the five oh first Vader's fist?
No.
Well mine is.

2542
02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:10.780
I got the storm trooper costume.

2543
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:14.440
Like what's five oh first Vader's fist.

2544
02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:17.450
There's an award or something.
Yeah,

2545
02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:20.510
there's an organization that does a lot of

2546
02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:26.270
just like work for like going to see cancer kids and stuff like that.

2547
02:37:26.271 --> 02:37:31.100
And it's all these people that are star wars villains and because they don't

2548
02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:34.610
make cop,
no one could make costumes cause it's all licensed.

2549
02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:37.700
So they have to make them themselves and then you go there and they'll validate

2550
02:37:37.701 --> 02:37:42.020
it and say,
okay,
you're good to go.
Your costume is good.
And then,
uh,

2551
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:45.030
and I hope I'm not screwing up the unit name,
but I think it's the,

2552
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:50.090
the fibo first Vader's fist.
Huh?
I've never heard of that.

2553
02:37:50.091 --> 02:37:53.810
That's pretty cool actually going deal one.
The one I have is like,

2554
02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:58.210
I don't know if it's a licensed costume or what,
but there aren't any,
you just,

2555
02:37:58.250 --> 02:38:00.020
it has to be so good that they're like,

2556
02:38:00.021 --> 02:38:04.620
they'll validate it because there's no such thing as a licensed costume.
No.

2557
02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:09.320
For any,
for just make this stuff somehow.
Yeah.

2558
02:38:09.321 --> 02:38:12.830
The ones that got sued,
we were like a lot,
they were like,
well I bought two.

2559
02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:14.870
There's a Darth Vader one and a storm trooper.

2560
02:38:14.871 --> 02:38:18.440
They were like a few thousand dollars to my brother.
$1,000 for,
well,

2561
02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:21.930
not just to have it though.
That's the thing.
He was spurred off for flex point.

2562
02:38:22.570 --> 02:38:26.570
I was making these videos,
the hobbies of Darth Vader,
I gotta go check those out.

2563
02:38:26.571 --> 02:38:28.140
Those are really good videos.
So,

2564
02:38:28.150 --> 02:38:32.330
so we use the to reach the potential on those videos.
By the way,
you didn't get,

2565
02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:35.000
you didn't get where you needed to get.
Well we were going,

2566
02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:36.880
I know the trajectory or like um,

2567
02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:41.840
like famous Jujitsu people like Jeff Glover Keeney corny like these guys.

2568
02:38:41.860 --> 02:38:46.250
Premise is we're just living our life.
But Darth Vader's here too.

2569
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:50.750
So like he's doing this,
he's going on dates.
He,
you know,

2570
02:38:50.751 --> 02:38:53.120
he's doing this stuff anyway,
it turned out kind of funny or whatever.

2571
02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:55.610
So there's one where the storm trooper was in it.

2572
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:59.180
He was kind of his lawyer when he got arrested at the choppy Dean's head off.

2573
02:38:59.390 --> 02:39:01.900
It was pretty good.
Yeah,
it's deep thumbs up.
He's like tricky.

2574
02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:04.040
He's like the ex boyfriend of his date or whatever.

2575
02:39:04.041 --> 02:39:06.080
So it's a theater like chops his head off.

2576
02:39:06.530 --> 02:39:09.920
So the next episode he gets arrested for that and then his lawyers a storm

2577
02:39:09.921 --> 02:39:13.410
trooper.
So that's why I love it.
Yeah.

2578
02:39:13.570 --> 02:39:17.780
Do you ever see that one where they did like a cops episode but it was troopers

2579
02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:21.800
and they're storm troopers and they show up to Luke's aunt and uncle and it's

2580
02:39:21.801 --> 02:39:25.490
really a domestic dispute and they kill everybody

2581
02:39:29.050 --> 02:39:32.680
know
it's old,
but yeah,

2582
02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:35.300
there's a lot of fun to be had with those guys for sure.

2583
02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:38.960
And then last I got the kettle bell and it got it from on it and they got some

2584
02:39:38.961 --> 02:39:41.380
good stuff on there.
[inaudible] dot com that's,
yeah,

2585
02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:45.290
good spot including star wars stuff.
I also got some books,

2586
02:39:46.010 --> 02:39:50.000
Mikey and the Dragon,
Mike in the dragons.
Jason,

2587
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:55.001
you were actually maybe the third or fourth person to hear me read Mikey and the

2588
02:39:55.191 --> 02:39:59.330
dragons and I did it on the beach in corn auto to you and iris.

2589
02:39:59.510 --> 02:40:02.810
I was so excited.
I couldn't believe it.

2590
02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:07.880
When you started rhyming and the whole thing kind of like how did you do that?

2591
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:12.530
It's like he's still rhyming and it's still going in.
This story is just awesome.

2592
02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:14.130
I'm super

2593
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:18.540
<v 0>stoked on Mikey and the dragons.
It's how old are your kids?</v>

2594
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:24.270
Eight and six and what age group can it go down to,
would you say?

2595
02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:27.540
I'd say probably three.
Yeah,
it can get young.

2596
02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:31.560
It's got very beautiful pictures that are bright and colorful.

2597
02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:35.880
There's so,
yeah.
And then the story rhymes.
It's going to make your kid smarter.

2598
02:40:35.970 --> 02:40:38.940
And there's times where I was when I was writing it,
you know,

2599
02:40:38.941 --> 02:40:40.500
they say right at a certain level,

2600
02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:44.730
but at the same time I put some words in there that kids aren't going to

2601
02:40:44.731 --> 02:40:46.290
necessarily know right away.

2602
02:40:46.410 --> 02:40:48.900
And so they need to look them up and they need to learn them.

2603
02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:52.290
Polies is one of them.
I remember using the word poison.
I was thinking,
well,

2604
02:40:52.291 --> 02:40:54.660
most kids won't know what poises and then I thought to myself,
good,

2605
02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:58.350
now they can learn a new word.
Be Smarter.
Yeah,
that's a good point though.

2606
02:40:58.351 --> 02:41:01.200
When you say where does it go down to?
So three,

2607
02:41:01.230 --> 02:41:03.060
I would say they're my sons like to,

2608
02:41:03.061 --> 02:41:07.110
he was like just before two and a half and I'd read it more reading it to my

2609
02:41:07.111 --> 02:41:09.480
daughter.
He's there,
but he'll catch certain things.

2610
02:41:09.481 --> 02:41:12.380
You know when there's like monsters ready to bite,
he'll be,
you know,

2611
02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:13.710
like he'll know certain stuff.

2612
02:41:13.711 --> 02:41:18.330
So as you kind of get older you absorb more and more.
But yeah,
if you're too,

2613
02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:23.760
it looks for them too.
There you go.
All kids.
If your kids are a little bit older,

2614
02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:28.350
you can get in way of the warrior kid.
You can get Mark's mission,

2615
02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:32.640
which is the second book in that series.
And now we have booked three coming out.

2616
02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:37.820
The title of book three is where there's a will and mark gets involved in some

2617
02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:43.260
more situations.
But luckily his uncle Jake is there to help them out.

2618
02:41:44.430 --> 02:41:48.600
I get so many pictures of kids doing pull ups,

2619
02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:52.470
working out,
studying.
They're going to be a warrior kids.

2620
02:41:52.530 --> 02:41:55.800
So get that book for your kids,
get that book for Your Library,

2621
02:41:55.801 --> 02:41:56.820
get that book for your school,

2622
02:41:56.910 --> 02:41:59.880
get that book for anyone that you know that has kids,

2623
02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:04.320
you'll be thankful and they will be thankful and they'll come and thank you in.

2624
02:42:04.740 --> 02:42:09.270
You know,
it's cool going to wrestling tournaments.
Yeah,
this is pretty cool.

2625
02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:12.090
I've had kids that are,
you know,
freshmen in high school,

2626
02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:17.280
so they're 14 years old or whatever and they're like,
Hey,
I read while your kid.

2627
02:42:17.281 --> 02:42:21.270
That's why I wrestled.
Yeah,
yeah.
Think about that.

2628
02:42:21.271 --> 02:42:25.050
So three years ago when it came out,
that kid got it and now he's wrestling.

2629
02:42:25.290 --> 02:42:29.580
That's what I'm talking about.
Get your kids that kids will listen.
Uncle Jake,

2630
02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:33.690
discipline equals freedom field manual.
If you want to know how to get after it.

2631
02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:36.090
There you go.
You have to wonder.

2632
02:42:36.690 --> 02:42:40.590
You can just get the field manual if you want the audio.
It's on iTunes,

2633
02:42:40.650 --> 02:42:43.470
Amazon music,
Google play,
and we're going to be the path lives.

2634
02:42:43.770 --> 02:42:46.230
I'm sure it's true.
Extreme ownership.

2635
02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:48.540
First Book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin

2636
02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:53.550
and then that follow on book is the dichotomy of leadership,

2637
02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:56.100
which is

2638
02:42:58.500 --> 02:43:02.330
takes all those lessons and shows where you can screw them up and then teaches

2639
02:43:02.331 --> 02:43:07.020
you how to fix them.
Dichotomy,
leadership,
both those books,
me and life.

2640
02:43:07.050 --> 02:43:08.970
We wrote them,
check them out,

2641
02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:12.100
and then we have echelon front leadership consultancy.

2642
02:43:12.101 --> 02:43:16.300
We solve problems through leadership.
It's me,

2643
02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:21.600
it's Leif Babin.
It's JP Denelle.
It's Dave Burke.
It's Flint Cochran.

2644
02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:22.980
It's Mike's Really.

2645
02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:28.100
It's Mike [inaudible] and it is now also Jason Gardner.

2646
02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:32.970
Jason is at Echelon Front.

2647
02:43:33.410 --> 02:43:38.400
He just retired and this is what we are doing.
He's already got gigs booked,

2648
02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:39.713
which is awesome.

2649
02:43:39.810 --> 02:43:44.760
Echelon front.com if you need help with leadership in your organization,

2650
02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:47.370
we will help you.
That's what we do.

2651
02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:50.400
We have the muster in 2019

2652
02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:55.840
2124 may in Chicago,
1920 September in Denver,

2653
02:43:55.900 --> 02:43:59.170
four and five December in Sydney,
Australia.

2654
02:43:59.530 --> 02:44:01.120
Every event we've done is sold out.

2655
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:04.600
Go to extreme ownership.com if you want to come,

2656
02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:08.650
otherwise it's going to be sold out and you won't be able to come and you'll be

2657
02:44:08.651 --> 02:44:12.850
all mad and you'd be mad at me.
And then someone said that,

2658
02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:17.500
it's like when I went to Lollapalooza and I went and saw a Rollins who I kind of

2659
02:44:17.501 --> 02:44:20.410
knew and I was like,
hey man,
can you get us in?

2660
02:44:21.310 --> 02:44:25.150
And Rollins said it'd be easier to sneak you into Fort Knox.

2661
02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:28.440
And I kind of like was all hardcore,

2662
02:44:28.450 --> 02:44:32.950
like you kind of forgot what it's like in the streets.

2663
02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:37.480
But it wasn't up to him exactly.
Now,
now I'm the guy.

2664
02:44:37.810 --> 02:44:39.570
Now I'm the guy that's going to be saying,
hey,

2665
02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:43.690
be easier to sneak you in a Fort Knox.
I gave you a heads up.
You're big time now.

2666
02:44:43.691 --> 02:44:46.240
So check.
That's that.

2667
02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:49.240
If online online interactive training

2668
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:55.630
from echelon front we needed to speak to more people and we don't have enough

2669
02:44:56.690 --> 02:45:01.160
instructors,
couldn't run enough monsters each year.

2670
02:45:01.250 --> 02:45:05.490
So if you want to know what we teach,
you want to get granular with it.

2671
02:45:05.491 --> 02:45:08.000
Check out f online.com

2672
02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:12.770
and finally we have the ETF Overwatch,

2673
02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:18.160
which is where we take guys that came from special operations and combat

2674
02:45:18.381 --> 02:45:21.890
aviation.
They have massive amounts of experience,
leadership experience.

2675
02:45:21.891 --> 02:45:26.210
They understand the principles we talk about,
we write about that we teach,

2676
02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:28.940
they understand those and they will bring them into your company.

2677
02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:33.140
You can hire them to work and help your organization

2678
02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:35.133
<v 1>when</v>

2679
02:45:35.290 --> 02:45:40.290
<v 0>for overwatch.com is where you can make that happen and if you want to keep this</v>

2680
02:45:40.511 --> 02:45:41.620
conversation going,

2681
02:45:43.210 --> 02:45:46.340
which is a pretty varied conversation where we're talking about star wars and

2682
02:45:46.350 --> 02:45:49.600
said sniper operations that are joggers in d and d.

2683
02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:52.420
I mean that's pretty good spectrum.

2684
02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:57.720
You know you might be that d and d old school d and d player with your

2685
02:45:58.331 --> 02:46:03.331
multi-sided dice getting after it and if you want to talk to us about that.

2686
02:46:04.270 --> 02:46:09.100
We are on the interwebs.
We're on Twitter,
we are on Instagram,

2687
02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:13.580
we are on the phone.
He bought echo was adequate.
Charles,

2688
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:17.960
I am at jockowillink.
Jason is at Jason,

2689
02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:19.460
n Gardner,

2690
02:46:20.140 --> 02:46:25.120
<v 2>Jason and Gardner and on a Facebook.
Jason Dot.</v>

2691
02:46:25.150 --> 02:46:28.440
N.
Dot.
Gardner on Instagram and Jason and okay.

2692
02:46:28.510 --> 02:46:32.620
<v 0>Gardner on Twitter.
And you're new to all three platforms?
No,</v>

2693
02:46:32.621 --> 02:46:35.440
I've been on Instagram and Facebook for awhile.
Okay.
You're just new to Twitter,

2694
02:46:35.441 --> 02:46:39.340
new to Twitter.
Have you ever checked out Twitter before?
No.

2695
02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:43.570
It's mayhem and then I heard I'm going to have to be careful.
No,
no,
I heard no,

2696
02:46:43.571 --> 02:46:47.770
don't like you do have to be careful.
Yeah.
And you kind of don't.
But it's weird.

2697
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:50.970
But then I found out like they were talking about,
uh,

2698
02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:54.880
maybe with Sam Harris and he was talking about deer.
There's legitimate,

2699
02:46:54.881 --> 02:46:58.930
there's Russian people,
Russian bots.
It sounds so funny.
They're sitting,

2700
02:46:58.931 --> 02:47:01.210
they're just trolling.
They're just trying to create mayhem.

2701
02:47:01.810 --> 02:47:04.750
And so we don't have a lot of man to be quite honest with you.

2702
02:47:04.780 --> 02:47:07.900
There's not a lot of mayhem coming at me,
but for whatever reason.

2703
02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:12.730
But everyone's pretty cool and it's,
it's,
I've gotten a lot out of it.

2704
02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:16.480
Out of Twitter,
out of Instagram,
out of Facebook,

2705
02:47:16.481 --> 02:47:19.660
people giving me information,
recommending books.
I'm,

2706
02:47:19.850 --> 02:47:24.850
I'm the book recommendations because I'm pretty much exhausting my personal

2707
02:47:25.181 --> 02:47:26.350
knowledge of books right now.

2708
02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:31.820
And so right now I'm getting so many good books from troopers out there that are

2709
02:47:32.051 --> 02:47:36.070
letting me know what's up.
So Echo.
Anything else?

2710
02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:41.230
Any other star wars comment?
Well Nino for right now,
no.

2711
02:47:41.231 --> 02:47:45.460
But now that we know that,
you know,
we had,
Jason has a knowledge,
mm.
Maybe later.

2712
02:47:45.461 --> 02:47:49.070
But yes,
for now.
Thanks for,
thanks for being here.
And Jason Go.

2713
02:47:49.071 --> 02:47:53.410
We'll continue this conversation.
Next podcast.
Anything else?

2714
02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:54.520
Any closing comments?

2715
02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:57.350
<v 2>I'm really excited to be on the podcast.</v>

2716
02:47:57.990 --> 02:48:02.570
I just want to tell my wife Iris that cheese amazing and made my life so much

2717
02:48:02.571 --> 02:48:05.660
better by meeting her.
Um,
my oldest son chase,

2718
02:48:05.661 --> 02:48:10.550
how proud I am of him and a storm and for love.
You guys.

2719
02:48:11.690 --> 02:48:14.240
<v 0>Awesome.
Looking forward to seeing you soon.
Awesome.</v>

2720
02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:17.270
And of course,
um,

2721
02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:23.020
we actually could not do this podcast or even live the lives that we live if it

2722
02:48:24.591 --> 02:48:29.591
wasn't for or people in uniform around the world here at home.

2723
02:48:30.801 --> 02:48:34.910
Our military personnel,
police and law enforcement,
firefighters,

2724
02:48:34.940 --> 02:48:38.240
paramedics and EMT is correctional officer's border patrol.

2725
02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:40.610
All first responders out there.

2726
02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:45.640
Thank you for what you do every day so that we can do what we do every day.

2727
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:50.870
And to everyone else that's listening until that next podcast,

2728
02:48:52.130 --> 02:48:56.510
remember that advice that Roth Guard gave Beowulf

2729
02:48:58.180 --> 02:49:03.100
that you should choose the eternal rewards,
not the short term ones.

2730
02:49:04.770 --> 02:49:05.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2731
02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:08.730
<v 0>And keep it in the back of your mind</v>

2732
02:49:10.330 --> 02:49:13.390
that you're piercing.
I will dim and dark and

2733
02:49:14.590 --> 02:49:15.240
<v 1>okay.</v>

2734
02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:20.220
<v 0>And death will arrive to sweep you away.
So until then,</v>

2735
02:49:22.270 --> 02:49:27.220
keep getting out there into the world
and getting after it.

2736
02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:34.370
Then until next time,
this is Jason Gardner and echo and Jocko

2737
02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:35.910
<v 1>out.</v>
