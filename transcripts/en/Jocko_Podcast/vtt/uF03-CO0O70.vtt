00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.670
This is Jocko podcast number 12 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.590
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.510
Sometimes people ask me,

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.940
what made me

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.373
<v 1>me?</v>

6
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.960
<v 0>How did I turn out like this?
Where did that come from?</v>

7
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.310
And I go back and I,
I pointed,
you know,

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.340
hardcore music growing up and it being in that scene where it was cool to be

9
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.890
hard and strong and it was about aggression and discipline.

10
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.490
And those were like the underlying theme saw it.
I pointed that,
you know,

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.470
and I think that's real.

12
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.720
There was mantras that I remember from those days that stuck with me,
my,

13
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.010
my whole life from some of those,
from some of that music.

14
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.080
Well then there's other things that influenced me as a kid and even even a

15
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:07.190
younger age.

16
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.580
And one of the things that I know influenced me at a very young age in a pretty

17
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:19.031
significant way was seeing the movie bridge on the River Kwai,

18
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.690
which is a classic war movie.

19
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.170
And that movie

20
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.400
pretty much had it all for me.

21
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.360
And I think I can trace my ideas of being a commando,

22
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.670
how to use that word.
You know,

23
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:41.770
that's kind of a archaic word that people don't use anymore commando.

24
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.890
But I think I got it from watching that movie when I was a kid.

25
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.880
And if you haven't seen that movie,

26
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.340
you should check it out for sure.

27
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:57.341
Because it's epic and it's a story of prisoners of war and American and British,

28
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.730
mostly British that are sent to build a bridge in the middle of the jungle in

29
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:09.731
Burma for a train line that is to connect Bangkok and rang goon.

30
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.000
And of course these are prisoners,
so they're badly mistreated,

31
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.170
they're beaten,
they're poorly fed.
Eventually one American escapes

32
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.790
and he leads a commando troop back to the side of the bridge to blow up the

33
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:32.840
bridge.
And they do it all at the commandos and a movie.
They do it all,

34
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:37.790
they parachute in and they swim up the river.
They laid demolition on the bridge.

35
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.580
It's like a dream operation.

36
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.170
And one part of the plot though is that the senior British officer at the camp

37
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.410
that the senior prisoner at the camp,

38
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.980
these name and then in the movie is the tenant Colonel Nicholson.

39
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.620
He takes a true leadership role in building the bridge.

40
00:02:57.621 --> 00:02:58.341
Now think about that.

41
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:03.341
He's being tasked by the Japanese to build this bridge and instead of

42
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.030
sabotaging the job,
because it's gonna help the Japanese,

43
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.120
he actually gets his Ben fired up and helps organize and has his engineer's

44
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.880
redesign it,
and they relocate it to a better piece of terrain.
And,

45
00:03:19.881 --> 00:03:22.510
and he pushes his men to do a good job building it.

46
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:26.980
And he actually takes pride in this bridge.
And again,
this is a bridge.

47
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.720
It's going to aid in Japanese,
Japanese domination.

48
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.660
So when the commandos show up to blow it up,
the colonel,

49
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.280
he,
he almost foils the attack,

50
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.750
but at the end the bridge gets destroyed.
It's an awesome movie.

51
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.560
And it was,
like I said,

52
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:55.561
it was very influential to me as a kid and people should definitely watch it.

53
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.660
And then you should know this.
It's all a lie.

54
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.400
What's the Lli there?
Well,

55
00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:10.401
there really was a bridge on the river Kwai and it really was built by prisoners

56
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.970
of war.
But that's about where

57
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.560
the similarities and what the prisoners suffered at the hands of the imperial

58
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:26.010
Japanese guards is beyond anything that they showed in the movie.

59
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.730
And really beyond anything that even remotely civilized person could imagine.

60
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.353
I was,
uh,

61
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.330
I was overseas recently in Europe and I was in Britain and a friend of mine gave

62
00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:48.680
me a book called the forgotten Highlander.

63
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.140
And he told me,
you know,
oh,

64
00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:54.020
it's by one of the soldiers that built the bridge on the river.
Kwai read it.

65
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.850
And I thought to myself,
okay,
you know,
great.
It's like the movie.
And he said,

66
00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:01.680
it's not like the movie.
It's not like the movie at all.

67
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.240
<v 1>And it isn't.
This is a book</v>

68
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.810
<v 0>that shows the ultimate in human suffering.</v>

69
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.540
And through that,

70
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.600
the ultimate in human will.

71
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.790
The Arthur Allister,
your cart

72
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.800
was fresh to the British military.
He was sent to Singapore.

73
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.940
And when Singapore was overrun by the Japanese imperial army,

74
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.000
he ended up in the jungle,

75
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.140
<v 1>a prisoner
and a slave.</v>

76
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.970
<v 0>By this time,</v>

77
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.960
mental health had become a major issue on the railway.

78
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.870
We all suffered from depression.

79
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.380
Men were taking their lives all along the railway.

80
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.660
Men cut their own throats,
put their heads on the railway line,

81
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.870
and simply walked into the jungle to die.

82
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.640
Many develop the a taps stare and just looked intent.

83
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.790
We ever fache roof of the Haute death.
Soon followed.

84
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.710
Others went mad because of medical conditions caused by vitamin decision

85
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:29.711
deficiencies and some just gave up losing their minds and their self control.

86
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.540
They would fight with anyone over nothing at all,

87
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.690
throwing punches,
biting,
kicking.

88
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.300
They needed to be controlled physically

89
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.000
but just could not be calm down.

90
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.200
It came to a point where something drastic had to be done to prevent innocent

91
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.260
men being killed by terrains to fellow prisoners,

92
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.710
some of whom had reverted to animal instincts.

93
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.280
The decision was made to build our own lunatic asylum to cage these poor souls

94
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.140
with the agreement of the Japanese,
the barrier party built two,

95
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:12.170
six foot square bamboo cages.

96
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.010
The mad men could stand or lie down in these just 10 feet from my hut and they

97
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:23.840
had a bench to sit on.
They received food and water,

98
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.860
but sadly,
we're largely ignored at night.

99
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:31.250
It was awful to hear them in the darkness jabbering in screaming,

100
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.350
throwing themselves at the cages.

101
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.970
The man who went in never came out alive.

102
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.610
Death would have been welcome for them.

103
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.930
It was a dreadful thing to see our fellow human beings caged like animals,

104
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.210
but what else could we do?

105
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.803
You know,

106
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.510
as I was preparing for this in a lot of times when I'm putting notes together,

107
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.860
I'm thinking about some thing that I'm going to say,

108
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:15.861
some comparable thing that I can bring back from some of my experiences

109
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.220
and I got nothing for you.

110
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.150
I got nothing for you and this,

111
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.850
this book is just like that.

112
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.500
Back to the book.

113
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.910
I turned to God several times,

114
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.850
often I felt my prayers went unanswered,

115
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.500
but I somehow live through this madness and I think that someone must have been

116
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:46.334
listening,

117
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.360
but faith in God could not prevent the beatings on the railway,

118
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.100
which were totally routine.

119
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.560
The threat of a rifle across your head or bamboo cane across your body forever

120
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.770
loomed large for no reason at all.

121
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:05.100
Why are whips would lash into our backs and draw blood.

122
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.380
Some guards would creep up on you and strike the open tropical ulcers on your

123
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:13.860
legs with a bamboo stick causing intense agony.

124
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.840
Often they delivered these beatings with such brutality and swiftness that you

125
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:22.560
did not see them coming or even know that they were what they were for.

126
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.270
Sometimes you just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

127
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.440
The Korean guards took a certain pleasure in the beatings.

128
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.600
They had expressed permission to kill prisoners without any reference to higher

129
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:37.434
authority,

130
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.850
but most of them would be satisfied to stop at the site of a blood trickling.

131
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.250
The beatings,
no matter how frequent,
never got easier to take.

132
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.620
In fact,
they got tougher each time.
I took a beating and chipped away,

133
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.270
not just at my bones and waning muscles,
but at my will to endure them.

134
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.273
The dilemma,

135
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.260
the dilemma was whether to swallow your pride by going down at the first blow or

136
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:08.460
to retain some of your dignity by taking several blows and standing up to them.

137
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.380
If you,
if you refuse to show that they're blows or hurting you,

138
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.000
they would fly into rages and the beating could be severe,
even fatal

139
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.720
from an early period.
The Japanese camp commandant,

140
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.540
whom I called the black prince,

141
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.650
became ever more inventive with his punishments.

142
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.940
I can not imagine a more sadistic and evil person on the planet.

143
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.240
The more heinous the so called crime,

144
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.840
the sicker the sentence under his instructors.

145
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.550
Under his instructions,

146
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.700
the guards had free reign if they felt you deserved something more than a

147
00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:52.664
beating,

148
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.410
it meant taking you aside and making you pick up a large boulder for the rest of

149
00:10:57.411 --> 00:11:00.350
the day.
You had to hold the rock over your head in the blazing heat.

150
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.020
Within minutes,
you're already weakened.

151
00:11:03.021 --> 00:11:06.710
Malnourished arms would start to twitch and fail you.

152
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.890
Before long,
you would have to drop the rock,

153
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.720
usually the size of a rugby ball or football mindful so that you did so without

154
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:18.380
letting it fall on your own skull.
When you let go,

155
00:11:18.381 --> 00:11:20.990
the guards would pounce fists,

156
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.820
rifle butts and boots flailing into your body until you picked up the rock

157
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:26.654
again.

158
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:32.110
It would go on all day and if the Japanese officer did not think you had learned

159
00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:37.520
your lesson sufficiently,
the punishment would be replete repeated.

160
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.320
Back at camp,
the black prince was a true bastard.

161
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.050
Others called him the can you kid?
But I thought my name is suited lieutenant.

162
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.610
Ooh,
Suki really?
Well.

163
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.700
He was darker than the other Japanese soldiers and strutted around like royalty

164
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.450
is beefy gut protruding from beneath a shabby uniform.

165
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.860
He despised us totally.
We were scum to him.

166
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.430
His absolute power over us and capacity for pity lessness per pitiless brutality

167
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.620
made him so terrifying to me.

168
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.333
<v 1>Okay.</v>

169
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.020
<v 0>Long before our decision to incarcerate crazy men,</v>

170
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.310
the Japanese had built their own cages.
The black holes,

171
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.340
as they were known were a higher form of punishment.

172
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.120
Those fortunate enough to be locked inside the those unfortunate enough to be

173
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:32.260
locked inside the sem,

174
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.570
the semi subterranean cages proportion so you could not stand,

175
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.900
lie down or even Neil Foley would be kept in for a month.

176
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:45.901
Typically corrugated iron and metal covered the bamboo to intensify the heat and

177
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:49.780
deprive victims of air and any cooling breeze.

178
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.050
Few who went in came out alive.

179
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.710
Yeah,
it's

180
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:03.400
<v 1>okay.</v>

181
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.233
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

182
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.170
It's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

183
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.920
The black prince,

184
00:13:18.921 --> 00:13:23.030
his right hand man was sergeant Cici,

185
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.260
known to US Brits simply as doctor death,

186
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.360
short and squat.

187
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.280
He took the roll calls and carried out all of the camp commandants orders.

188
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.390
Presumably he was more educated than the other Japanese or Koreans,

189
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.580
but he was evil to the marrow.
Ruthless in the extreme.

190
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.560
He loved tormenting us.

191
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.370
He especially reveled in a sickening brand of water torture.

192
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.880
He had guards pin down his hapless victim before pouring gallons of water down

193
00:13:55.221 --> 00:13:58.100
the prisoners throat using a bucket and a hose.

194
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.090
The man's stomach would swell up from huge volumes of water.

195
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.930
<v 0>He would then jump up and down gleefully on the prisoners stomach.</v>

197
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.850
Sometimes the guards tied barbed wire around the poor soul.
Stomach.

198
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.530
Few survived

199
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.440
when a prisoner was caught stealing from the Japanese officers,
storeroom,

200
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.230
or if a man turned on a guard,

201
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.370
they received the next grade on the sliding scale of Japanese torture.

202
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.250
I called it the Indian rope trick,

203
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.300
one favored by Indians in the old cowboy films.

204
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.260
The helpless prisoners would be tethered,
spread eagle to the ground.

205
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.790
They wrapped wet rat,

206
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.680
the same string like bark used to lash are bamboo huts together around his

207
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:00.320
ankles and wrists and tied him to stakes in the ground.

208
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.330
As the return dried,

209
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.540
the ties would slowly gas into the skin drawing blood and tearing into the sinew

210
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:11.180
and cartilage as it pulled limbs from their sockets.

211
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.770
It reduced even the toughest men to agonize,
screaming,

212
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.930
and they would be there all day.

213
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.230
I would almost be glad to get out of camp in the mornings just to avoid hearing

214
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:26.690
their cries of unbridled pain.

215
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.680
It was a way of torturing all of us.

216
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.450
Often when returned from a day on the railway,

217
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.250
the men would no longer be there.

218
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.450
Nobody asked where they advantage too.

219
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.110
I certainly did not want to know after such a horrific ordeal at the end of a

220
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:51.500
Japanese bay,
Annette would have been welcomed.

221
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.240
So as time went on,
eventually know when they showed up,
they had their,

222
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.170
their pants,
their shirt,
their boots,
their socks,

223
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.840
and as time went on de Paul,

224
00:16:19.841 --> 00:16:23.500
that stuff just got destroyed to got eaten by the jungle as they worked and

225
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.820
eventually fell apart

226
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.620
and one of the worst things to lose is the last thing that Alastar lost was his

227
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:37.510
boots.

228
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.333
<v 1>Okay.</v>

229
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.830
<v 0>Now in bare feet,
I had a new challenge.</v>

230
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.500
My feet were extremely soft from living constantly in wet boots and the ground

231
00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:54.240
was particularly unforgiving.

232
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.740
The jagged volcanic rocks off and hiding just below the surface of topsoil.

233
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.770
I knew that the soles would harden up,

234
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.530
but until then I would have to walk like a cripple.
When using the speed,

235
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:11.580
I wouldn't be able to use my foot to dig deeper into the soil and would have and

236
00:17:11.581 --> 00:17:13.890
would require more upper body strength.

237
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.920
Having no boots also made the ever frequent trips to the Bengals,

238
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.950
the latrines even more unsavory.

239
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.750
They were revolting,
vast open pits.

240
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.330
Later covered in after we can.

241
00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:33.210
Prisoners began to collapse into them and drown.

242
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.390
As you approached the Benyus,

243
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.220
you had to wade through the mud layered with excrement of those disencouraged

244
00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:43.710
sufferers who never quite made it.

245
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.630
Flies and maggots and flies and maggots swarmed.

246
00:17:48.631 --> 00:17:51.060
And over this foul mush,

247
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.570
it got so bad that we had a bucket of water at the entrance to wash our hut to

248
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.510
wash our feet in it all added to the misery.

249
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.110
It's amazing what we take for granted,
isn't it?
Yeah,

250
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.490
to say the least.
And he goes on to talk about,

251
00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:19.570
and if you,
if you,

252
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.890
how do you deal with this when you're going through it and he writes in moments

253
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.400
of adversity,

254
00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:32.170
I would often think back to my childhood and remember going barefoot during the

255
00:18:32.171 --> 00:18:36.370
long hot summers we spent down at the Aberdeen,
Aberdeen,
sure.

256
00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:39.580
Fisher fishing village of Newton Hill where I was born.

257
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.650
So there is,
you know,
having to go barefoot.

258
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.680
His feet practically falling off and the best thing he can do is try and think

259
00:18:51.551 --> 00:18:55.960
of the good times in his life when he was forced to go barefoot.

260
00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.570
And you would think,

261
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:08.470
you would think some level of comradery would be critical.

262
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.340
And this is one of those books where again,

263
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:21.270
in almost every military book you hear about leadership and comradery and

264
00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.970
there's points in this book where that stuff fails,

265
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.400
<v 1>fails,</v>

266
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.430
<v 0>and this is where he kind of talks about that.
Back to the book,</v>

267
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.460
I even castigated myself for getting involved with another prisoners problems.

268
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.490
Once you got started with sentimentality in grief,
you were a goner.

269
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:52.260
It was a selfish tactic,
but I was desperate to survive.

270
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.740
I was refusing to let the Japanese when this,

271
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.440
like on the death march,

272
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.760
some men found the going easier by teaming up and making a close bond with

273
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:06.720
another prisoner.
They would fight railway life together,

274
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.520
sharing whatever food they had,
helping each other wherever they could,

275
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.110
and always having their back.

276
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.890
They even took beatings together to share the blows and the pain.

277
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.800
It was not the way for me.

278
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.510
I watched the heartache of men losing their best pals and suddenly being left

279
00:20:24.511 --> 00:20:26.960
alone.
They never leave.

280
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.620
They never usually lasted very long and soon followed their mates to their
grave.

281
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:35.880
<v 1>By</v>

282
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.660
<v 0>now.</v>

283
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.660
The cuts on my feet and legs had turned into painful and dangerous tropical

284
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:43.830
ulcers.

285
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.890
When I suffered scrapes on the railway or had a rash,

286
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.610
I could not tend to it until yes sumi time,

287
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.840
which is like rest time or he's time or until I was back at camp.

288
00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.370
Then I wrap leaves around the cuts at night to keep the flies off,

289
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.700
but it was a useless and the ulcers usually spread.

290
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.870
They routed your flesh muscle and tendons.

291
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:13.530
People were left with gaping holes as the flesh simply fell away and also would

292
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:18.961
eat deep into your flesh so deep you could sometimes see the white of bone even

293
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:21.910
worse if you are not careful,

294
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.980
they can become gangrenous and many men lost legs that way.

295
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.580
By improvised amputation without anesthetics or drugs.

296
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.580
I went to the medical hut for advice in common with most of the men.

297
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:48.930
Tropical ulcers had engulfed my feet,
ankles,
and lower calves.

298
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.990
I had avoided the medical hot until that point.

299
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.430
It was set aside from the sleeping hots and about the same size as ours.

300
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.300
The officer in charge was Dr Mathew Mathewson,

301
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.820
a likable character from Paisley,

302
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:06.510
just outside Glasgow where he had studied medicine.

303
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.600
He had come to Singapore about the same time as me and would later in much

304
00:22:12.601 --> 00:22:16.620
different circumstances saved my life on this.

305
00:22:16.621 --> 00:22:21.150
My first encounter with him,
he would at least save my legs

306
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.700
sneaking under the cloud of black flies that circled outside the hut like a

307
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:30.880
swarm of miniature vultures.
I entered nervously.

308
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.570
The overpowering stench immediately had me gasping,

309
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:40.410
stepping across the cadavers forms of five or six men who appeared to be rapping

310
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:45.730
at death's door.
Dr Mathewson introduced himself.

311
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.720
I had not spoken for so many days that when I went to reply,

312
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:53.080
my parched throat failed me here.
He said,

313
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.590
handing me a half coconut cup of water.
Get this down you.

314
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.700
I sipped the cool water down and thanked him asking how his patients were.

315
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.210
Doctor Matthia centered,

316
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.410
his mid thirties at this point appeared weary beyond his years.
He,

317
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.950
he was probably on self imposed half rations just to keep some spare for his

318
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:16.900
patients.
The men.

319
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:21.190
It's spoke highly of him and many of our docs doctors were revered as saintly

320
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:22.090
figures.

321
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.640
The doctor took me by the arm and led me down to the far end of the hut away

322
00:23:27.641 --> 00:23:31.330
from the men in a soft west coast accent.

323
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.430
He said,
half of these men will die within days.
The other half,

324
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.960
who knows if I had access to some proper clinical treatments,

325
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:45.070
drugs are instruments they might live,
but that is not possible.

326
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.860
As I'm sure you know,
I can only nod in agreement.

327
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.630
The squalor and stench of death inside the hut was appalling.

328
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:59.520
What can you do for them?
I asked quite simply,
not a lot.

329
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.550
I try and give them some hope.
If nothing else,

330
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.383
he went on.

331
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.370
It's easy for these men to give up and when they lose hope,

332
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.580
the fight just seems to seep right out of them.

333
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.830
On countless occasions,

334
00:24:22.831 --> 00:24:27.810
I've seen two men with the same symptoms and the same physical state and one

335
00:24:27.811 --> 00:24:29.580
will die and one will make it.

336
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.930
I can only put that down to sheer willpower.

337
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.580
We do talk about willpower.

338
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:54.240
<v 0>I don't think we've ever discussed a willpower at this level,</v>

340
00:24:55.530 --> 00:25:00.530
and that is when you have two men with the same symptoms of the same physical

341
00:25:01.351 --> 00:25:03.990
state in one dies and one lives,

342
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.650
and the doctor's only determination as he thinks it comes down to sheer

343
00:25:07.651 --> 00:25:08.484
willpower,

344
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.490
but will is strong.
Who's the strong force?

345
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.140
I considered this for a moment and looked around the hut.

346
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.770
You could tell the man who were dying by the look on their faces.

347
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.340
Their gaze was lost before it reached their eyes,

348
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:37.200
and no amount of positive attitude care for Dr Mathewson could change their

349
00:25:37.201 --> 00:25:41.280
destiny.
It certainly was not the medical staff's fault.

350
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:42.960
Their hands were tied.

351
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.340
No blood was firmly on our captors hands.

352
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:53.120
I told myself right then and there that I would not stop fighting.

353
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.730
What can you do for this?
I asked the doctor,

354
00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:10.140
lifting a foot onto a bamboo cheer,
tropical ice,

355
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.940
tropical ulcers,
a disease of food,
filth,
and friction.

356
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.740
Do you know what maggots looked like?
Maggots,

357
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.320
I asked frantically inspecting my foot,

358
00:26:22.321 --> 00:26:27.210
praying that I was subject to some sick joke.
Yes,
maggots,

359
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.810
they'll fix you right up.
Go down to the latrines,

360
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.880
find yourself a handful of those we white beasties and set them on your ulcers.

361
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.850
They will chomp through the dead flesh.
Before you know it,

362
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:43.380
you'll be right as rain almost as an afterthought.

363
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.280
He added.
Remember to count how many you put on carefully.

364
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.320
You don't want to forget one and leaving it there to eat itself to death.

365
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.240
I left the medical whole hut shaking my head,

366
00:26:57.241 --> 00:27:00.750
still wondering if I were being had letting maggots eat.

367
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:03.480
My skin did not sound particularly appetizing,

368
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:07.830
but I was willing to willing to try anything I knew I had to stop the rot that

369
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:09.540
was devouring my legs.

370
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.350
The latrines were nothing more than holes in the ground,

371
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.890
but now with bamboo slats across them,

372
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:23.030
a bunch of jungle leaves usually laid pile near or you took your own foliage or

373
00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:27.210
toilet paper.
If there was no river water collected for the job.

374
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.510
I did not have to go far to find what I was looking for.

375
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:35.520
I gingerly scooped up a handful of maggots watching them squirm and wriggle

376
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.940
without thinking about it too much.

377
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
I found a quiet spot nearby and sat down placing just two or three out of nasty

378
00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:49.040
ulcer on my ankle.
The maggots,
which were about a quarter of an inch long,

379
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.880
instinctively knew what to do.

380
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.320
They started gnawing away at my skin in the most with the most minuscule of

381
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:59.070
bites.
The sensation was of tingling.

382
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:04.160
Unearthly yet not altogether unpleasant until the realization that the maggots

383
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:09.261
were eating your raw flesh came racing back to the forefront of your mind.

384
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.690
I can still feel that sensation to this day,

385
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.500
but to Dr Mathewson's credit,
it certainly worked within days.
The wounds,

386
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:23.130
it started to heal and nu skin grew back.

387
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.360
It was a trick that I persisted with throughout my time on the railway,

388
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.570
passing it on to other men when I thought I could.

389
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:35.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

390
00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:40.340
<v 3>They still use that today,
by the way.
The maggots thing.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

391
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.280
well I've heard of it.
That's crazy how he was kinda like,
um,

392
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.140
like,
you know,
I'll never forget that feeling of the maggots,
but he,

393
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.810
he talked about it as not being totally unpleasant.
Kinda liked it.

394
00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

395
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.040
<v 3>Probably because he knew it was kind of healing them,
you know?</v>

396
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.900
<v 2>Yeah.
I don't know.</v>

397
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.880
<v 3>It's heavy breathers heavy.
Yeah,</v>

398
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.600
<v 0>so now we get into a guy that had tried to escape,
was captured.</v>

399
00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.820
I was unaware that anyone had escaped until one morning.

400
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.730
A sorry looking chap was dragged before us.

401
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.380
He had been horrifically beaten,
is swollen and bloody features,

402
00:29:29.381 --> 00:29:31.030
virtually unrecognizable.

403
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.220
The interpreter told us this man very bad.
He tried to escape.

404
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:37.503
No good.

405
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.490
Two guards threw him down to the ground in front of us,

406
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.910
<v 1>the battery wreck of a human frame and made him kneel.</v>

407
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.250
<v 0>He did not plead for mercy or beg for assistance.</v>

408
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.380
He knew his fate and waited.
Silently resigned to it.

409
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.610
The black prince who seem to have dressed up,
especially for the occasion,

410
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.000
strode forward and unsheathed his long Samurai's sword.

411
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.110
He prodded the prisoner in the back,
forcing him to straighten up.

412
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.040
<v 0>Then the black prince raised his sword.</v>

414
00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.620
It stainless deal glinted in the sunshine.

415
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:24.590
It was a moment of such horror that I could scarcely believe it was really

416
00:30:24.591 --> 00:30:27.950
happening.
I closed my eyes tightly.

417
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:33.910
This was one of the many instances of barbarism on the railway that I would try

418
00:30:34.821 --> 00:30:36.620
to shut out of my mind,

419
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.610
but I could not escape the chilling swash of the blade as it cut through the

420
00:30:42.611 --> 00:30:47.290
damp tropical air or the sickening flack of the sword coming down on our

421
00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:51.190
comrades neck,
followed by the Dole thump of his head,

422
00:30:51.191 --> 00:30:55.770
landing on the ground.
I kept my eyes firmly shut,

423
00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.500
but suede on my feet and felt a collective gasp of impotence,

424
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.630
anger,
and revulsion.

425
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:15.240
And that line right there
is

426
00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.200
something that when I heard it and when I read it,

427
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.720
I kind of thought to myself that this is what separates every experience I've

428
00:31:26.721 --> 00:31:30.650
had in my life with this.
And that is this,

429
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.940
this gasp of impotent anger and revulsion.

430
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.180
So the angers there,
the revulsion is there,

431
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.540
but it's impotent and you can't do anything about it because you're a slave and

432
00:31:44.061 --> 00:31:48.830
you're at the mercy of another human being.
Your freedom has been taken away.

433
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.260
And I talk about freedom

434
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:03.610
fairly often

435
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:12.450
and I don't think there could be any greater reminder of how precious freedom is

436
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.190
been reading about someone.

437
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:27.140
About a group of men that have had their freedom completely taken from them.

438
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.090
Now,
at this point in the book,

439
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.410
and I wanted to point this out because if you have seen the movie,

440
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:49.430
the bridge on the river Kwai,
he makes some,

441
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.940
he kind of spells out the differences.

442
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.940
The building of the bridge on the river Kwai took a terrible toll on us and the

443
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:09.080
depiction of our sufferings in the film of the same name was a very,

444
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.080
very sanitized version of the events.

445
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:15.500
Unlike the welfare add extras in the movie,

446
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.500
we did not whistle colonel bogey tune,

447
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:23.960
nor did we work alongside Americans,
nor do we have any semblance of a uniform.

448
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.440
We were naked,
barefoot slaves,

449
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:33.100
and there were certainly no pretty and scantily clad local girls wandering

450
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:37.610
through the jungle and contrary to the film are real life commander.

451
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.900
Colonel Philip Tuesday did not collaborate with the Japanese.

452
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.240
I was not alone in doing as little work as possible without blatantly shirking,

453
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.440
which resulted in sadistic beatings,
energy.

454
00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:54.620
Every ounce of it had to be conserved for survival.

455
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.210
To bust a gut on starvation rations was absolute suicide.

456
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.090
We had long lost our dignity and working faster certainly would not have brought

457
00:34:05.091 --> 00:34:09.650
it back.
In fact,
it would have resulted in us in the opposite,

458
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:13.390
would even more of us dying.
Instead,

459
00:34:13.391 --> 00:34:18.391
we made constant attempts to sabotage med whispered orders to impair the

460
00:34:18.731 --> 00:34:20.650
construction of the bridge wherever possible.

461
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:26.130
Some charged with making up concrete mixtures deliberately added too much sand

462
00:34:26.201 --> 00:34:30.490
or not enough,
which would later have disastrous effects.

463
00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:34.450
We collected a huge numbers of termites in white ants and deposited them into

464
00:34:34.451 --> 00:34:37.000
grooves and joints of load bearing trucks

465
00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:43.030
out of sight of guards.
I,
I saw it halfway through.

466
00:34:43.031 --> 00:34:45.160
Wouldn't bolts wherever possible,

467
00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:50.220
hoping they would snap whenever any serious weight like a train was placed upon

468
00:34:50.501 --> 00:34:51.334
them.

469
00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:56.590
But the river Kwai and its tributaries harbored a killer even more lethal than

470
00:34:56.591 --> 00:34:58.990
the Japanese and our starvation diet

471
00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.700
as an inevitable consequence of the lack of sanitation and the tens of thousands

472
00:35:05.861 --> 00:35:09.430
of bodies buried in shallow graves are dumped along in the jungle.

473
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.580
The river system was loaded with cholera bacteria and the monsoon season became

474
00:35:16.211 --> 00:35:17.200
Colorado season

475
00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:25.020
as the heightened waters of the [inaudible] of the quiet flushed Vibrio chlorine

476
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.590
Culinaria
throughout the land.

477
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:34.710
This fearful disease cast a black shadow over the camp collar arrived unseen and

478
00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:38.730
unheard,
but soon had us in its grip.

479
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.410
I was slow to hear about it,
but I sent something terrible was in the camp.

480
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:49.130
More men were falling ill than usual and the Japanese kept their distance

481
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.540
leaving us alone.
They were scared to death of catching cholera themselves.

482
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:04.070
So this wretched disease comes into camp and you just don't think things can get

483
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:08.710
worse and they do

484
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.250
<v 1>okay</v>

485
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:15.450
<v 0>and you think that Allister's get or avoid cholera,</v>

486
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.693
but he doesn't.

487
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.870
Overnight cholera struck me down.

488
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:28.000
I woke up with explosive diarrhea and violent projectile vomiting.

489
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.850
My ears were ringing as I felt dizzy.

490
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.370
Cramps started in my bowels and soon spread all over my body as it rapid be

491
00:36:36.371 --> 00:36:39.850
dehydrated.
I was drying from the inside out,

492
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.760
shriveling like a picked grape left out in the sun,

493
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:48.100
the cholera bacteria burden to the walls of my small intestine producing toxins.

494
00:36:48.101 --> 00:36:52.600
That sucked my vinyl salts and every ounce of water out of my body.

495
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.280
I was unsure what was wrong,
but I knew this,
but I knew it was serious.

496
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:03.600
I did not want to finish up with life drained out of me.

497
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.770
I had always been extremely careful to drink only boiled water,

498
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:12.660
so at first I was doubtful that it was cholera.
I did not know much about it,

499
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.350
but I knew that the first 24 hours were crucial.

500
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.050
If you see through a day in a night,

501
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:24.410
you would probably survive most men who succumbed did so in the first few hours,

502
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.900
a horrible death and so quick men who threw the bodies of cholera victims onto

503
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:34.770
the few funeral pyres in the morning could easily contract the disease,

504
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.470
die and be thrown on the pyre themselves.

505
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:42.471
That evening they died in agony like crazed animals and it was dreadful to see.

506
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:56.120
I lay in my bed unable to rise for Work Party by that I was semiconscious and I

507
00:37:56.851 --> 00:38:00.540
thought it was the end.
I was hallucinating,
vivid red flashes,

508
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:02.340
stormed my eyelids.

509
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.450
I knew I had to seek help after psyching myself up on.

510
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.710
I managed to rise and wobble to doc doctor Mathewson's hut.

511
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.070
As soon as I walked in,
he knew that I had cholera.

512
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.240
It was a death sentence and he was reluctant to tell me.
Instead,

513
00:38:18.241 --> 00:38:22.170
he looked at me and simply said,
you'll have to be isolated.

514
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.460
You'll be looked after.

515
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.200
His orderlies led me to a cream colored tint like the ones we had used in the

516
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:33.900
scouts.
As they peel back the tents front flap,

517
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:38.140
a deathly leaped out unknown to me.

518
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.680
This was the death tent and I was the unlucky 13th occupant of a dimly lit space

519
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.880
already full of men.
When I saw their state,

520
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:52.150
their eyes rolling back rasping unintelligible voices,

521
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:56.590
their legs raised with knees bent.
The bizarre telltale sign of a cholera,

522
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.140
a sufferer.
I knew that my number was up.

523
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.380
The orderlies were putting me here to die.

524
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:08.230
The fight was feeding from me and I laid down on the canvas floor with a sense

525
00:39:08.231 --> 00:39:11.860
of complete and utter desolation,

526
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.610
but he did survive.
Out of the 13 men that wind to the tent.

527
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.370
He was the only survivor

528
00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:28.813
<v 4>now.</v>

529
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

530
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.660
<v 0>At this point in the book,</v>

531
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:41.660
<v 4>and I want you to remember that this isn't a book.
This is another human being,</v>

532
00:39:41.661 --> 00:39:45.290
his life and at this point in Allister's life,

533
00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.160
he actually got moved to

534
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.890
<v 0>a nother facility,</v>

535
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:56.390
another prison camp that was for people that weren't really bad,

536
00:39:56.391 --> 00:39:57.260
bad shape.

537
00:39:59.090 --> 00:39:59.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

538
00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.410
<v 4>And he was there.</v>

539
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.440
He went through some recovery time and that's a very important part of the book.

540
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.150
And then he begins working on the docks,
you know,

541
00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:22.860
unloading food stores for the Japanese soldiers and loading them.

542
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.380
And eventually it comes time for him to be moved.

543
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:38.080
And so they move the prisoners of war by shipping them

544
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.440
on four September,

545
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:45.520
1944 900 British POW is,

546
00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:49.930
we're rushed up the gangway of the Cotcha Dokie Maru,

547
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:54.520
a 10,000 ton cargo vessel that had been named for,

548
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.090
that have been named the President Harrison before it was captured from the

549
00:40:58.091 --> 00:41:00.970
Americans using sticks.

550
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.740
The Japanese drove us like cattle aboard the ship and down into the holds.

551
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:11.260
We can never move fast enough for them.
The liner had two holds,

552
00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:16.000
both quite obviously not made to accommodate human beings yet.

553
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:19.330
They wanted around 450 of us in each.

554
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.330
The lads below were shouting,
begging,

555
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.390
and pleading for the Japanese not to let any more men,

556
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:27.730
but the louder they shouted,

557
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.840
the more frenzied the gars became down and down.

558
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.280
We went into the depths of hell.

559
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:41.170
Nothing in all of our suffering had prepared me for anything like this and even

560
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:46.630
today I can scarcely find the words to describe the horrors of the catch.

561
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:51.530
A Doki Maru.
By the time I got down to the hold,

562
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.440
I had nowhere to sit.
It was standing room only.

563
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:59.210
Most of us packed in like star sardines with no toilet facilities.

564
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.650
Most had dysentery,
malaria,
Barry,
Barry,

565
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:06.320
and all manners of tropical diseases.

566
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:12.190
Once inside and the hold crammed full,

567
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:17.590
the Japanese battened down the hatches plunging us into a terrifying black Pitt.

568
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:19.880
At that moment,

569
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:25.390
the most fearful clamor went up as claustrophobia and panic gripped the men.

570
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.710
Many feared they were doomed and began screaming and shouting.

571
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.920
You had a strange tranquility came over me.

572
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.280
I felt resigned and just thought,

573
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.890
this is it.

574
00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:47.170
I thought that we would never get out alive.
I would never see home again.

575
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.260
You felt resigned to accept this as your last.

576
00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.700
I could only think that they were taking us out to sea to sink the ship and

577
00:42:54.701 --> 00:42:57.580
drown us.
All our captors were capable of it.

578
00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.730
I had seen what they were capable of.
Anything.

579
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.473
<v 2>Okay.</v>

580
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.860
<v 4>We knew nothing about these ships which would become infamous in the annals of</v>

581
00:43:07.861 --> 00:43:12.861
the Second World War history as hell ships a fleet of dozens of rusting hoax

582
00:43:14.221 --> 00:43:18.840
used to shuttle supplies and prisoners around Japan's far eastern empire.

583
00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.020
Some of the most appalling episodes.

584
00:43:22.021 --> 00:43:27.021
The war occurred on these ships in which men driven crazy by thirst,

585
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.640
killed fellow prisoners to drink their blood.
In some cases,

586
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.010
prisoners trying to escape from the CV.

587
00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:39.240
Massive hysterical captives were shot by Japanese soldiers.

588
00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.940
Some voyages took weeks with only a handful of prisoners surviving.

589
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.250
Men drink their own urine.

590
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.880
Sick prisoners were trampled to death or suffocated.

591
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:57.370
The sane murdered the insane and wondered when it would be their turn to go mad

592
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:03.240
cannibalism as well as vampirism was not unknown and even Japanese medics were

593
00:44:04.481 --> 00:44:07.780
shocked by what they found when the holds were finally opened.

594
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:13.740
In the case of the Oroco Maru were insane prisoners killed fellow man for their

595
00:44:15.191 --> 00:44:16.024
blood.

596
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:21.120
Only 271 men survived out of 1,619

597
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:29.390
so all those times that you think of horror movies and they don't seem realistic

598
00:44:29.491 --> 00:44:30.960
and you don't think it could ever happen,

599
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.280
it has happened.

600
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.660
There must have been at least one officer,

601
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:42.630
a warrant officer or a sergeant major somewhere in the hold,

602
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:47.520
but they certainly didn't make themselves known.
Discipline had gone,

603
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:51.600
everyone,
whatever their rank was in the same situation.

604
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:56.070
All of us just wanted to survive and we're prepared to do anything to ensure

605
00:44:56.071 --> 00:44:56.904
that happened.

606
00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:01.410
It would have taken a very brave man to try and take command of the men in the

607
00:45:01.411 --> 00:45:05.370
hold and these conditions,
it would have been suicidal

608
00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.980
eight.
Again,
that's one of those points where,

609
00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:17.110
you know every book we've talked about,
no matter how bad things get,

610
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.140
there's a leader ready to step up.

611
00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.760
Then you wonder if there's a line that you could ever go across where that

612
00:45:24.761 --> 00:45:28.420
doesn't happen.
Well,
here it is.

613
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

614
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.980
<v 4>I thought,
I never thought anything could ever match.</v>

615
00:45:36.981 --> 00:45:41.981
The terror of the railway being in the hold was worse.

616
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:47.690
At least slaving on the railway.
You could move and you had fresh air.

617
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.930
Then another dread thought struck me,
submarines,

618
00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.360
the catchy Docu Maru had no Red Cross markings painted on it.

619
00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.060
I would later learn that,

620
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.530
that none of the hell ships bore any indication that [inaudible] we're on board

621
00:46:06.531 --> 00:46:09.170
as they were required to do by Geneva Convention.

622
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:15.380
Red Crosses were however painted on Japanese ammunition carriers.

623
00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.960
My fears that without markings,

624
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:21.350
we were a target for our own side.

625
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:27.160
So he starts thinking,
well,
um,

626
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:30.850
we're part of the Japanese fleet.
Now.

627
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:36.100
What if we get attacked by our own people?
What if we get sunk

628
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.410
and as you can probably foresee,

629
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.030
because this story is just a misery upon misery.

630
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.090
It happens

631
00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.510
in the hold of the Catcher,
Doki Maru,
the tournament went on,

632
00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.600
the noise was constant and deafening and awful.

633
00:46:59.601 --> 00:47:03.800
Cacophony of throbbing engines,
moaning,

634
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.140
coughing and occasional panic stricken,

635
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.710
screaming the background music for this latest torture.

636
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:15.770
The chilling screams of the mad and insane would stop abruptly.

637
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.000
I don't know how they were dealt with,
but I could imagine

638
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:27.690
I was completely stuck where I was in the hole and could not move.
No one could.

639
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.000
You couldn't sit or lie.
You couldn't even go down to your haunches.

640
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:35.080
There was so little room you didn't really want to lie down anyway.

641
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:38.920
It was a sea of human waste and you rest being trampled.

642
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:43.420
You had your space and protected it with your life.
Quite literally.

643
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.900
You stayed strong protecting your space with elbows and fists by any means

644
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:51.700
necessary.
By this stage,

645
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.130
it was every man for himself.

646
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:59.230
Each person had their own problems to resolve their own life to save.

647
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.673
<v 2>Again,</v>

648
00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:07.050
<v 4>we have not seen this yet.
Every man for himself.</v>

649
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.013
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

650
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:17.030
<v 4>The smell inside the hold was indescribable or a pug.</v>

651
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.450
Stench and overpowering mixture of excrement,

652
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:24.200
urine vomit,
sweaty bodies,
weeping,

653
00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:27.710
all servers and rotting flesh clock.
The atmosphere.

654
00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.280
There was no way we could get any fresh air.

655
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:35.660
Even when the Japanese open the hatches,
it really didn't help that much.

656
00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.200
You are still breathing in what was already there

657
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.700
first became our biggest problem.

658
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.140
People don't understand what real thirst truly is.

659
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:53.450
You start to hallucinate and see Mirages and that is the most dangerous thing.

660
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:57.200
People died down in the holes from suffocation or heart attacks.

661
00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:02.090
The men who died were not taking away their bodies lay among us.

662
00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.230
So one of the other vessels,

663
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.983
<v 2>okay,</v>

664
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.530
<v 4>that they're out with gets hit with a torpedo.
American torpedo.</v>

665
00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.670
It's another vessel that's holding prisoners of war.

666
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.820
It is the

667
00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:33.290
1,317 were killed.

668
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:38.183
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

669
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:42.170
<v 4>Or sorry,
1,317 prisoners were on board.</v>

670
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.770
None of them were killed by the explosion,

671
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:52.690
but 1,159 of them ground or died of exposure.

672
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:56.653
<v 2>And</v>

673
00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:02.000
<v 4>mind you.
These were all guys that had served on the death of rail way.</v>

674
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:08.060
Guys that had already suffered just unimaginable torture

675
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:23.340
and then as he suspected,
it became their turn.

676
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:26.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

677
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.190
<v 4>Four minutes later,</v>

678
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.590
<v 2>we suddenly felt a tremendous blast and an explosion tore through the hold.</v>

679
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:36.050
The whole structure shuttered and water flooded in it from above.

680
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:40.310
I knew then as the water crashed on top of me that my worst fears had been

681
00:50:40.311 --> 00:50:44.870
realized.
We'd been hit and I knew that the torpedo had struck very close to us.

682
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:49.310
It was in fact the first of two torpedoes that would send the hell ship to the

683
00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:53.150
bottom.
Within 15 minutes,
the ship tilted.

684
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:54.740
We were going down

685
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.920
<v 4>so the ship sinks.</v>

686
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:07.610
Now the Japanese said immediately tried to get off with lifeboats.

687
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.790
It left all the prisoners trying to just create rafts with whatever they could.

688
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:16.540
Even after the sinking,
the killing went on.

689
00:51:16.541 --> 00:51:19.030
For those of us who survived and got onto rafts,

690
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.940
anyone starting to panic was thrown off into the sea.

691
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.950
When they scrambled to get back,
they were kicked away.
Men pushed under and held.

692
00:51:26.951 --> 00:51:31.951
The Japanese men pushed under an held under Japanese survivors fighting broke

693
00:51:33.791 --> 00:51:37.090
out as the animal instinct to survive asserted itself,

694
00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:41.410
making some survivors try to capture more seaworthy vessels and shove others off

695
00:51:41.411 --> 00:51:45.040
to their deaths.
Many gave up already,
so weak,

696
00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:49.100
dangerously dehydrated and ill.
Many golf,

697
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:51.970
salt water and quickly went stark raving mad,

698
00:51:51.971 --> 00:51:53.890
drowning themselves to end the torment.

699
00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:58.990
Horrible as it may sound.
As men became mad,

700
00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:04.020
they had to be shoved off of the rafts or boats or the remainder might've parish

701
00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:05.943
perished.

702
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:07.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

703
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.690
<v 4>There was a lot of shouting and screaming,
cries of,</v>

704
00:52:10.691 --> 00:52:15.430
get off you bastard or I'll kill you.
Made me close my eyes and distress.

705
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:20.350
Most of the shouts or English,
there were not many Japanese,

706
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:24.610
the majority of whom had gotten off early in the lifeboats,

707
00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:30.070
drowning and dying.
Men called for their wives,
their children or mothers.

708
00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.500
Men said things like,

709
00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:37.180
daddy will be home soon and then disappeared beneath the waves.

710
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:42.260
It was horrifying to here.
By that stage,

711
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:47.000
most of us,
we're treading a very fine line between sanity and madness.

712
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:50.720
It didn't take much to put people over the top.

713
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:53.690
I couldn't see where it's coming from.

714
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:57.740
But a group of men started singing first to keep their spirits up.

715
00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:02.680
They sang rule Britannia
after the seller rang a incident.

716
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:07.480
We had been banned from singing this stirring anthem with its line about

717
00:53:07.481 --> 00:53:10.510
Britain's never ever being slaves.

718
00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.580
So there you start seeing some spirit.

719
00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.133
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

720
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.240
<v 4>As they start singing rule Britannia now cellaring incident was when some</v>

721
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.160
prisoners,
it just,

722
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:33.640
just when a Japanese taken over and Singapore and the light,

723
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:35.670
and I forgive me if I don't remember this correctly,

724
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:41.300
but a couple of guys that tried to escape and they got caught and basically it

725
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:46.040
was a standoff between the,

726
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:51.770
the soldiers and the Japanese prisoners are Japanese prison camp commanders.

727
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:54.990
And they wouldn't end the,

728
00:53:55.470 --> 00:54:00.210
the soldiers did not back down until they had executed for,

729
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.250
uh,
the four prisoners that had tried to escape.

730
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:07.350
And then they kept everyone else locked in this compound for five days.

731
00:54:07.351 --> 00:54:12.351
And when the guys started to die from starvation and dysentery and dehydration

732
00:54:13.621 --> 00:54:15.210
than they,
they said,
okay,
we'll spend,

733
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:17.580
they signed a paper that said no one else would try to escape,
but they,

734
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.040
they held the line as long as they possibly could.

735
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:21.043
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

736
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:28.750
<v 4>244 of my comrades on there catch a Doki Maru died that night.</v>

737
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:33.490
It was tragic beyond belief that having survived the death railway,

738
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:35.740
they became prisoners of the deep

739
00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:43.080
1,403 allied servicemen had died as a result of the failure of the Japanese to

740
00:54:43.961 --> 00:54:47.920
observe the Geneva Convention and apply Red Crosses to our hell ships.

741
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:55.230
He ends up getting recaptured by the Japanese after the,

742
00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:59.790
after the ships.
Yes,
he does survive.
He gets recaptured by the Japanese.

743
00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:03.840
Eventually he's close to where Nagasaki is,

744
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.310
but far enough away that he doesn't die from the blast of Nagasaki.

745
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:09.660
The war ends.

746
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:14.190
They get picked up and eventually they're

747
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:20.780
obviously brought home by Americans and eventually sent back to England.

748
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:28.650
He says that when he left Aberdeen,
he'd Wade healthy hundred and 35 pounds,

749
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.920
but here in Nagasaki on the steel yard scales,

750
00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:35.040
very act accurate contraptions.

751
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:39.690
Similar to those I'd used at the plumbers merchants,
I was reduced,

752
00:55:39.691 --> 00:55:42.990
reduced to a skeletal 82 pounds.

753
00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

754
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.030
<v 4>I've got some pictures of these guys.</v>

755
00:55:47.031 --> 00:55:51.770
I mean they literally look like skeletons.
It's,

756
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.420
it's,
it's unbelievable that they were even able to survive

757
00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:04.490
new arrivals.
Men from the vast industrial gulag.

758
00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:10.240
The Japanese had created in Phuket an hour flooded the quayside and lengthen the

759
00:56:10.311 --> 00:56:13.490
cues for showers.
So they're basically cleaning these guys up now,

760
00:56:13.491 --> 00:56:18.320
getting ready to put them on ships and ship them back to America.
Sadly,

761
00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.850
at this final hurdle,

762
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:24.970
some did not make it and died on Quaye this distressed the Americans immensely

763
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.900
and they were shocked by the matter of fact way that the other prisoners

764
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.030
accepted the deaths of their mates.

765
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.120
We had seen so much

766
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:40.980
too much.

767
00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.193
<v 2>Now</v>

768
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.160
<v 4>I think quite possibly this is the</v>

769
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:05.320
heaviest book that we've talked about

770
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:10.750
on the podcast.
Yeah,
I would agree with that.

771
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:15.490
And it's one of those things where

772
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:25.810
it's a question if people

773
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.070
are even going to want to listen to this,

774
00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:32.680
and I understand that.

775
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:38.740
I understand that some people did not make it through this reading

776
00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:45.110
and some people
listened to it.

777
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.560
Some people are gonna buy this bulk of which they should,

778
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:55.250
and some people are going to take this
as a

779
00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:00.260
message

780
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.850
from somebody who has seen evil

781
00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:12.560
in a way that not too many people can claim to have seen

782
00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:19.180
in a person that has had their every freedom taken from them and their lives and

783
00:58:22.851 --> 00:58:23.840
their destiny

784
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.300
put into the hands of sadistic people.

785
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.460
Now,
if you did make it this far,

786
00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:42.200
I will
let this end

787
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:45.283
on a,

788
00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.610
on an incredibly,

789
00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:51.950
incredibly

790
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.370
positive note and message

791
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:01.623
<v 2>from the author</v>

792
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.270
<v 4>and he says this,</v>

793
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:14.290
my time is a prisoner of the Japanese helped shape and determine my path in life

794
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:17.800
just as much as my childhood did.
Like it or not.

795
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:21.680
The horrors did happen to me and to thousands of others.

796
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.280
Yet some good has come out of it.

797
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.030
My ordeal has made me a much more patient,

798
00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:34.180
caring person inspired by the devotion of our hard pressed medics on the death

799
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:37.154
rail way.

800
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:41.930
I was able to care for my young daughter when she was ill and from my late wife

801
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:47.650
who required 24 hour attention in the last stages of her life while in Japan and

802
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:51.320
working with my friend Dr Mathewson,

803
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.800
I vowed to spend the rest of my life helping others and I'm so pleased to say

804
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:58.550
that I have done so.

805
00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:03.130
It is where my satisfaction comes from nowadays.

806
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

807
01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:10.130
<v 4>I have tried to use my experiences in a positive fashion and have adopted a</v>

808
01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:14.760
motto from them,
which I never tire of telling others.

809
01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:19.020
There is no such word as can't.

810
01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.940
I have not allowed my life to be blighted by bitterness at 90 years of age.

811
01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.510
I've lived a long life and continue to live it to the fullest.

812
01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:37.440
I enjoyed a long marriage to my wife and I have been fortunate to have a family

813
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.570
and to enjoy their success.

814
01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:46.000
I've amazed my doctors,
my friends,
my family,

815
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:49.000
and myself by remaining fit.

816
01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.820
I am grateful for my present way of life.

817
01:00:55.270 --> 01:01:00.270
After all the turmoil that life has thrown at me and thankful to have retained

818
01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:04.560
my sense of humor.
Most importantly,

819
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:08.610
I now visit schools to tell pupils what really happened in the Far East during

820
01:01:08.611 --> 01:01:12.930
those term terrible warriors and my 91st year.

821
01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:18.150
I am fortunate enough,
despite the best efforts of the Japanese imperial army,

822
01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:23.940
to have the vim and vigor required to tell a new generation of how we suffered

823
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.540
scandalously our sufferings,

824
01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.160
which of haunted all of us Far East prisoners of war throughout our lives.

825
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:36.990
We're only recognized by the British government in the year 2000 when it offered

826
01:01:36.991 --> 01:01:40.950
compensation of 10,000 pounds to remaining survivors.

827
01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:42.720
Unbelievably,

828
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.820
the British taxpayer had to pay out that poultry sum and not the culpable

829
01:01:47.821 --> 01:01:49.020
Japanese government.

830
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.200
I hope this book will stand as an indictment of the criminal regime that ran

831
01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:59.820
Japan during the war years and the failure of successive Japanese governments to

832
01:01:59.821 --> 01:02:01.410
face up to their crimes.

833
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:08.140
But I hope too that it will be inspirational and offer hope to those who

834
01:02:08.341 --> 01:02:13.170
suffered adversity in their daily lives,
especially in these difficult times.

835
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.750
Life is worth living
no matter what it throws at you.

836
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:26.900
Is it important to keep your eyes on the prize of that happiness will come

837
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.760
even when the death rail way reduced us to little more than animals,

838
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
humanity and the shape of our st we medical officer's triumphed over barbarism.

839
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.560
Remember,
while it seemed,

840
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:46.170
while it always seems darkest before the dawn,

841
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:50.940
perseverance pays off and the good times will return.

842
01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.210
May Health and happiness be yours,

843
01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.900
Allister Urquhart

844
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:04.830
July,
2009

845
01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:20.510
life is worth living.
Geez.

846
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:27.260
Yeah,
the book is the forgotten Highlander.

847
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.140
It is a phenomenal read.
It is a reality check.

848
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:35.840
It is

849
01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:39.790
incredibly moving

850
01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.420
and I highly recommend you buy it.
You read it,

851
01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:48.450
<v 2>okay.</v>

852
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.620
<v 4>And you understand what the world is.</v>

853
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.220
You get a better understanding of what the world is about.

854
01:03:56.221 --> 01:04:00.870
And I know I definitely got a better understanding of what the world is about in

855
01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:01.704
reading this.

856
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:03.003
<v 2>Okay.</v>

857
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:08.040
<v 4>We're pretty much every detail,
like every,</v>

858
01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:12.000
every little element that he went through made me think like,
Dang,
I'd rather,

859
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:14.250
I'd probably rather die in that situation.

860
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:17.070
I know every little thing that happened.
Yeah.
And there's,
uh,

861
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.120
there's obviously thousands and thousands and thousands of men that made that

862
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:25.530
choice.
Yeah.
And there will got broken and they just,

863
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.840
they lost the will to live.

864
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:34.550
So it's incredible how strong the human will is that you can survive that e two

865
01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:41.151
pounds distri starvation ulcers in your legs,

866
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:46.110
putting magnets on your legs.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's just,
um,

867
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:51.810
it's truly incredible what the,
what the human can survive.

868
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.470
And it's also truly incredible what the human can complain about in this day and

869
01:04:55.471 --> 01:04:57.570
age.
Right.
I mean,

870
01:04:57.571 --> 01:05:02.400
we can complain about just the most ridiculous things.
Yeah.

871
01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:07.950
Just the most ridiculous things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

872
01:05:07.951 --> 01:05:10.200
He'll help pig that spectrum is,
yeah.

873
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:14.310
Just remind me to never complain about anything ever again.

874
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:18.220
You know what I mean?
Don't,
don't let me complain

875
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.970
<v 5>about anything ever again.
I mean,</v>

876
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:26.590
I don't consider myself a big complainer,
but come on,
this is just,

877
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:31.960
we have no reason to complain about anything.
Yeah,
yeah.
Men,

878
01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:36.370
what's crazy too is one of one of the heavier parts there where I felt it was

879
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:38.530
when he talked about the claustrophobia heart.
Yeah.

880
01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:42.940
I know you have an issue with it.
Bang.
It's there,
but it's not,

881
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.020
it's not,
I'm not super sensitive to it,
but it's something I know.
I feel that,

882
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:51.670
that,
that's like a tough one to get over it,
you know?
Yeah.
Dang.

883
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.570
And especially going through all that stuff first and then you got to deal with,

884
01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:00.370
I dunno,
man,
this might be too heavy for me.
Well,

885
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:01.870
it was too heavy for a lot of people

886
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:07.570
and yeah,
I mean it's almost like

887
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.290
we almost don't need to have a discussion about this book.
You know,
meg just,

888
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:18.030
just stop talking about it.
Everyone go read it.
I get it.
You know?
And just,

889
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:22.960
let's move on,
you know,
because like I said,

890
01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.910
it just makes you realize

891
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:32.340
just what kind of suffering there can be and how good you've got it.

892
01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.290
How good you've got it.

893
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.200
I'm going to go to bed tonight in my bed and it's going to feel good.

894
01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:42.840
You you're good to appreciate that I'm appreciated every night.
Yup.

895
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.321
Yeah,

896
01:06:44.321 --> 01:06:48.220
so cause you think about like some little things you don't even think about,

897
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.590
but they're like a real luxury.

898
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:55.880
It's just things that you really enjoy but you don't even think about it.

899
01:06:57.371 --> 01:07:02.100
They're just,
they're just like a whatever.
Like for me,
I really like a nice cold,

900
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:06.940
you know,
big a bottle of water.
You know,
I have a big,
just a big bottle of water.

901
01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:10.000
I completely take it for granted.
When I go to workout in the morning,

902
01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:12.550
I dropped a couple of ice cubes in there and fill it up.

903
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:17.080
It's all nice filtered and whatnot.
Oh I don't think anything about that.

904
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.790
That would be like Heaven,
heaven.
And then you get,

905
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.240
do you know you go to bed at night,
you just crawl into the,

906
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.430
to the the 500 thread sheets or I don't know.
There's some,

907
01:07:30.431 --> 01:07:32.800
there's some kind of sheets that are nice,
but whatever.

908
01:07:32.801 --> 01:07:36.790
They are some kind of cotton sheets that are all nice.
Yeah.

909
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:39.220
You climb into those,
you don't think about that.

910
01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:44.080
You're not thankful for that every night.
Yeah,
pretty much everything,

911
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:46.330
pretty much.
It pretty much everything.

912
01:07:46.331 --> 01:07:50.200
Even like how you know how you're breathing right now,

913
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.950
consider that compared to that.
What you just read there?
Just,

914
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:55.810
well just breathing.
Listening.
She started with that.

915
01:07:55.870 --> 01:08:00.640
Let's just break it down with air.
Yay.
The beginning.
And I remember,

916
01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:05.590
um,
the cable guy was coming,
which already sounds silly.

917
01:08:05.591 --> 01:08:09.900
I know.
And I'm,
and he was late.
He was supposed to come to,

918
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:12.820
was the cutoff,
right where he was going to call.
It was like,
you know,

919
01:08:12.821 --> 01:08:16.280
before the struggle is real.
The cable guy was late.
Yeah.

920
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.470
<v 3>So he can't,
I dunno,
two 15 or something and I had to go,</v>

921
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:23.900
I want to see it go to workout or something.
This is getting worse and worse.

922
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:26.660
I know this,
the point is get a bt.
Yeah.

923
01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:29.730
For my 15 minutes later he's,
you know,
he's,

924
01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:33.000
he's fixing that fixing thing.

925
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:37.340
Yeah.
And,
yeah,

926
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:40.820
and that's one of the things I thought of primarily when you said think of all

927
01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:44.990
the little luxuries.
So not only,
not only am I complaining

928
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:47.990
about something I don't need,

929
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:52.040
I'm complaining about something that I'm kidding,

930
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.630
like supreme luxury.
I'm complaining about that,

931
01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.800
you know,
because it didn't come 15 minutes of all things,
um,

932
01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.240
before the time that it did.

933
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.713
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

934
01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:13.380
I'm gonna check myself to good idea.
I'm going to check myself too.

935
01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:20.250
So with that,
what's,
uh,
what's,

936
01:09:20.251 --> 01:09:24.810
go to some questions
from the Internet

937
01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:29.220
and actually to start this one off,
um,

938
01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.550
after the last podcast,
number 11,

939
01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:37.380
when I had lay fon and we talked about mark,

940
01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:40.830
we talked about Mark Lee,
we talked about Ryan,
Joe,
we talked about Chris Kyle,

941
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:46.170
and you know,
we actually didn't talk about Mikey Monster.
So

942
01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:49.020
I had a couple of people ask me,
hey,

943
01:09:49.021 --> 01:09:52.200
why don't you guys talk about Mikey mountain store?
Well,
the,
the,

944
01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:58.140
the simple reason is it's kind of similar to the reason why I hadn't talked

945
01:09:58.141 --> 01:10:03.141
about mark and Ryan and Chris yet either until I got laid off on,

946
01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.340
because leaf was the,
the Charlie platoon commander.

947
01:10:08.341 --> 01:10:12.270
Those guys were in Charlie platoon.
And you know,

948
01:10:12.271 --> 01:10:15.630
I wanted to have him on as a,

949
01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.970
you know,
as,
as a,

950
01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.890
I don't know what the word I'm looking for is,

951
01:10:22.891 --> 01:10:27.891
but I wanted to have guide from his platoon on or from their platoon on to talk

952
01:10:30.211 --> 01:10:33.390
about them.
And I just,
that's the way I felt.

953
01:10:33.391 --> 01:10:35.310
And so that's what I stuck with with Mikey.

954
01:10:35.311 --> 01:10:40.230
Mikey was in Delta platoon and I can promise you,

955
01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:47.970
I will be talking about Mikey at some point on this.
Mike.
He was just

956
01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.670
phenomenal and a hero and a saint.

957
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.433
And

958
01:10:56.910 --> 01:11:01.910
I will actually absolutely be covering his life and how he died and how we

959
01:11:06.601 --> 01:11:10.380
remembered him then,
how we remember him still.
But I,

960
01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:15.300
I really just want to get,
you know,
somebody,
his platoon that was,
you know,

961
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:19.740
right with him,
uh,
the whole time.

962
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:24.360
And that's just,
this is the way I feel about it.
So that's what I'm going to do.

963
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.590
And
yeah,

964
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.120
so that's what gonna do with Mikey.
So it was Mikey.
Mikey will definitely,

965
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:39.300
we know we'll have a show for Mikey.
Absolutely.
Mikey deserves a hell of a show.

966
01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.060
Uh,
and we will have it for Mikey.
So be ready for that.
I don't know whom to get.

967
01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:48.650
A lot of the,
a lot of guys from Delta two that are still on active duty,
uh,

968
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.840
the platoon commander still on active duty,
the,
uh,

969
01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:56.940
all his good friends are still on active duty.
So it's going to be tough.

970
01:11:56.941 --> 01:11:59.070
It's going to be tougher.
It might take a little bit of time,

971
01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:03.450
but that's the plan and it'll be worth it.

972
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:07.980
So let's go to the next question,

973
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.790
<v 3>Jackal.
Regarding mistakes.
What are some of your own,</v>

974
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.240
in some you've seen made by leaders you've looked up to and how to recover?

975
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:24.150
Can someone ever fully regained trust?

976
01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:28.240
<v 5>This is actually a pretty easy one because,
um,</v>

977
01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:34.000
look,
if you make a mistake,
own it.
Uh,
the,

978
01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:37.180
the worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is

979
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.110
trying to avoid taking blame for it.
That's the worst thing you can do.

980
01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.210
And if you think about the bosses that you've had,

981
01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.330
did you have some boss that made a mistake?
And he's like,
no,
it wasn't my fault.

982
01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.170
You just totally lose respect for him.
So you can't do that.

983
01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:55.120
You got to take,
you got to take ownership of it.
Um,
it cause any,
again,

984
01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:58.510
if you think about the bosses that you've had and the Times that you had a boss

985
01:12:58.511 --> 01:13:01.840
that made excuses,
you don't have any mercy on them,

986
01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.530
you're just ruthless on them,
you just pick them apart.

987
01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:11.830
So that's step number one is,
um,
you know,

988
01:13:11.831 --> 01:13:13.750
take ownership if you make a mistake.

989
01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.930
And that's how it's always seemed to me from,

990
01:13:16.931 --> 01:13:19.150
as I looked up the chain of command,
you know,

991
01:13:19.151 --> 01:13:21.640
if I saw a guy that made mistakes and then he took ownership and we were like,

992
01:13:21.641 --> 01:13:24.220
okay,
cool,
the guys,
you know,
he knows he made a mistake.

993
01:13:24.221 --> 01:13:27.370
Oh well we'll support them if they're doing the other thing and they're blaming

994
01:13:27.371 --> 01:13:28.750
everybody else,
they're not taking ownership.

995
01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.600
You're going to have a hard time with that.
And as a matter of fact,

996
01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.530
I actually had a mutiny in,

997
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:40.330
in one of my platoons where this was a long time ago.
It's,
you know,

998
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:45.800
all the names are long since forgotten,
but we had a,
we had a,

999
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:50.680
a mutiny in our platoon where we said,
you know,
pretty much on us,

1000
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:55.450
US lower enlisted guys.
We had a,
we went to the,

1001
01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:00.250
we literally went to the commanding officer and say,
we don't work with this guy.

1002
01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.520
Yeah.
So you know,

1003
01:14:03.521 --> 01:14:07.300
all these ideas that people have of the military and have,
you know,

1004
01:14:07.301 --> 01:14:10.900
we obey orders and all this stuff.
I mean,
think of what a little jackass I was.

1005
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.150
We,
you know,
we say,
well,
you know what?
We don't want to reface guy.

1006
01:14:14.151 --> 01:14:17.080
We're going to go to the commanding officer and tell him we don't want to work

1007
01:14:17.081 --> 01:14:21.700
for this guy.
And a commanding officer.
To his full credit,
he was like,

1008
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:25.720
listen guys,
you can't have a mutiny.
Not at my command.
Not at my team.

1009
01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:30.610
You guys suck it up.
You figured out a way to work it out.
Go do what you're told.

1010
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:35.050
Get in line.
Oh,
so the mutiny didn't work and then he fired the guy.

1011
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:36.620
Yeah,

1012
01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:41.620
no one he liked basically made it perfectly clear like this is your one chance.

1013
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.860
And he fired him.
But it was,
it was,
it was pretty crazy to see,

1014
01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:51.130
to see it happen.
But,
and I say this all the time,

1015
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.680
it wasn't because the guy lacked tactical scale.

1016
01:14:53.681 --> 01:14:55.510
It wasn't because he was physically fit.

1017
01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.660
Most of the reason was because he just couldn't take anyone's,

1018
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:03.880
you know,
advice.
He wouldn't listen to anybody.

1019
01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:07.690
And so when he was making a mistake,
it was like,
no,
no,
we'll do it this way.
No,

1020
01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:08.524
it's okay.

1021
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:13.180
Constant cover up for himself and obviously it,

1022
01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.620
it didn't work out for him.
So you're mutiny sorta just put him on,

1023
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:21.490
put him on notice.
That was his write up essentially.
Yeah.

1024
01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:26.080
But I think the commanding officer I think was really just doing the right
thing.

1025
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.900
Saying,
look guys,
you can't have a mutiny.
Doesn't work that way.

1026
01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:32.140
This is the military.
Get back in there,
do what you're supposed to do.

1027
01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.480
And then he was like,
okay,
I've got to fire this guy.

1028
01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:40.020
Must not be good to have every enlisted guy in the platoon come forward and say,

1029
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:42.820
I don't want to work with this guy.
That's not a good sign.

1030
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:46.540
So the commanding officer did an outstanding job and he was actually a great,

1031
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.340
great commanding officer too.
So it kind of worked on the DL.
It worked on the DL,

1032
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:53.620
I guess as an echo would say.
And then I actually,

1033
01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:56.380
the guy that took over was one of the best guys I ever worked for it,

1034
01:15:56.381 --> 01:16:00.310
if not the best.
Dang.
Yeah,
it was pretty awesome.
Um,

1035
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:03.460
and then as far as regaining trust,
which is the other part of the question,

1036
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.830
it's almost as soon as you admit that you made a mistake,

1037
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.930
you are automatically regaining trust.

1038
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:13.780
That's where you start regaining trust and it just goes from there.

1039
01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:16.270
Then you follow through with what you say.
You know,

1040
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:19.120
you're constantly trying to build trust and relationships.

1041
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:22.180
That's what you're trying to do.
And the minute you're blinding to people,

1042
01:16:22.181 --> 01:16:23.290
how are you building trust?

1043
01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:26.470
And if you make a mistake and you say it's not your fault,
then that's a lie.

1044
01:16:26.471 --> 01:16:29.890
And everyone knows it.
Yeah.
That,
that fear is,
um,

1045
01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:35.380
especially not especially,
but in regards to regaining trust,
so to speak,
uh,

1046
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:39.250
in when someone admits mistakes,

1047
01:16:39.251 --> 01:16:41.260
they have that fear that all they're going to think,

1048
01:16:41.261 --> 01:16:44.500
I don't know what I'm doing or I don't have a handle on this,
you know,

1049
01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:49.420
so doesn't matter.
It's so doesn't matter.
It's so much better to go,
hey guys,

1050
01:16:49.421 --> 01:16:51.790
I don't really know how to do this.
Can you show me how to do this?
I'm not sure.

1051
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:53.940
I've never done this before.
Right.
Or Hey,
never,

1052
01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:55.750
I've never used this kind of weapon before.
Can you give me an,

1053
01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.790
an UNDOC on this thing?
Right,
right.

1054
01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:00.640
The worst thing you can do is step up to the line with a weapon you've never

1055
01:17:00.641 --> 01:17:03.850
used before and not know how to lock and loaded or clearance safe.

1056
01:17:03.851 --> 01:17:05.170
And it looked like a total idiot.

1057
01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:10.400
Cause then you look like a guy that is too arrogant and too insecure to ask.

1058
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:12.590
Yeah.
It's actually,

1059
01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:16.370
it's actually a sign of insecurity if you can't ask when you need some help with

1060
01:17:16.371 --> 01:17:16.950
something.

1061
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:18.480
<v 3>Yeah.
And it's funny how when Pete,</v>

1062
01:17:18.481 --> 01:17:21.590
when people were in that position and how can it just,

1063
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:27.040
this is kind of a general thing to know is that you're,

1064
01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:31.920
you come off way more transparent than you think.
You know,
people will like,

1065
01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.470
I dunno,
something just as small as like name dropping.

1066
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.120
If you name drop someone right even or you just mentioned this person named but

1067
01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:44.010
you're really named dropping even in a small way like people can smell that.

1068
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:45.810
So even like this stuff,

1069
01:17:45.811 --> 01:17:48.900
stuff that's a little bit more important where if a leader's insecure about

1070
01:17:48.901 --> 01:17:50.900
something I want to make,
like he knows everything but he really does.

1071
01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:53.010
Even I do stuff like that.
I know,
but

1072
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:57.750
I hate when I do stuff like that I'm like Oh God.

1073
01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.530
And it's transparent.
Everyone,
everyone knows it.

1074
01:18:01.531 --> 01:18:04.680
And a lot of people brother not in touch with that.
They think that all,

1075
01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:07.590
yeah they don't know cause I'm just going to sort of mention it and there's all

1076
01:18:07.591 --> 01:18:11.240
these little things that it's just you just reek of and I don't want,

1077
01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:14.040
I don't want to put it like that.
I want it.
I'll just say,
like I said,

1078
01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.220
you're way more transparent than you think.

1079
01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:18.120
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1080
01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:23.120
And transparent in this day and age actually has a positive connotation.

1081
01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:26.790
I don't know if you know that,
but people view,
oh,
he's really transparent guy.

1082
01:18:26.791 --> 01:18:29.520
You know,
he really just tells you what's going on.
If you're deliberately terms,

1083
01:18:29.521 --> 01:18:34.521
you're using it in a negative way so people can see right through your bs and

1084
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:39.590
you're not trying to be transparent.
Right.
There's a big difference there.
And uh,

1085
01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:45.030
totally true.
But it is definitely better just to,
you know,
ask and say,

1086
01:18:45.031 --> 01:18:45.390
Hey,

1087
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:50.340
I dunno that insecurity that when you don't feel like asking something that's a

1088
01:18:50.341 --> 01:18:54.390
little knock at your door that says,
oh,
you're insecure,
you're insecure.

1089
01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.580
When you're like,
Hey,
you know what?
I don't know how to do this.
Can you?

1090
01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:59.190
Can you be a hand with this?
Or I'm stuck on this problem here.
Can you,

1091
01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:02.760
can you give me help with us?
Cause I don't know how to do it.
People don't say,

1092
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:06.210
Oh,
this guy's an idiot.
Unless you're doing it every three sentences.

1093
01:19:06.211 --> 01:19:09.030
Does that mean means you haven't studied?
Yeah.
Cause you gotta study,

1094
01:19:09.031 --> 01:19:12.660
you gotta know your trade,
you got to know your craft.
And if you don't,

1095
01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.350
you got to learn it.
No,
you've got to break out the books and get on it.

1096
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.110
But once you broken out the books and now there's a little bit of stuff that you

1097
01:19:19.111 --> 01:19:21.930
still don't understand.
Well guess what?
Just ask the question.
Yeah.

1098
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:23.670
Cause your frontline troops is,
are gonna know more than you.

1099
01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:26.100
They should know more than you.
Yeah.
You know this,

1100
01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.990
it's highly likely that there are no more than you.

1101
01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.560
I mean I was a radio men for eight years in the seal teams and by the time I was

1102
01:19:31.561 --> 01:19:36.540
a lieutenant commander in a troop,
I didn't know as much as those,

1103
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:39.420
you know,
guys knew about all the new radios and stuff.

1104
01:19:39.421 --> 01:19:41.940
So I just have to ask a question.
It's no big deal.
Yeah.

1105
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:45.360
If you're secure in your leadership,
you're,

1106
01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:48.450
you're fine to ask a couple of questions.
It's not that big of a deal,

1107
01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:53.310
but you are not clear to lie to people.

1108
01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:57.270
You're not clear to make excuses.
And that's what,

1109
01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.970
that's how you regained the trust is by telling people the truth.

1110
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:02.900
It's really a simple concept,
you know.

1111
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:06.150
Next question

1112
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:13.290
in regards to working out and training for,
um,
you know,
selection.

1113
01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.300
And by selection you mean,

1114
01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:20.070
I mean special forces or ranger or seal selection,

1115
01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.310
that's what they're talking about here.
Yeah.
So Jocko,

1116
01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:28.110
what do you think of rucking as fitness versus just train up?

1117
01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:30.641
So for,

1118
01:20:30.641 --> 01:20:35.430
for people that don't know what rocking is rocking is putting a backpack on a

1119
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:39.410
rucksack with a bunch of weight in it and walking long distances.
And,

1120
01:20:39.411 --> 01:20:41.970
and to be honest with you,
you really are jogging.
You know,

1121
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:45.120
you're really going at a pretty good pace when you're doing it.
And that's it.

1122
01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:47.100
As far as rucking,
that's what running is,

1123
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:52.340
because in the military they can bring the pain with Rachmat marches,

1124
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:56.460
forced road marches is what they're called.
Yeah.
You'd be rocking all up.
You,

1125
01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.350
you'll be rocking till you don't want to be rocking.

1126
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:04.350
And,
uh,
and so,
you know,

1127
01:21:04.351 --> 01:21:07.200
you'll do 20 mile force Roadmarch,
which is just,

1128
01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:10.890
you're on the road with a 50 pound pack,
just marching.

1129
01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.400
And,
uh,

1130
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:17.580
so the thing is like anything else,

1131
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:23.250
if you want to get good at it,
you got to do it right.

1132
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:26.170
So if you want to get good at,
I people ask me why I need to get,

1133
01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.410
we're going to get it going to pull ups,
you know,
how do you get good at poems?

1134
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.100
Do pull ups,
how do you get good at running run?
How do you get at swimming?

1135
01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.380
So I'm,
Oh,
you want to know how to get good at Jujitsu?
Did you do to,

1136
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:41.260
you know,
get on the Mat and do Jujitsu a bunch.
Yeah.
Uh,

1137
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:44.760
and if you want to get good at ruckinge,
at Hump in Iraq,

1138
01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.550
carrying weight over long distances,
rock,

1139
01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:50.430
cause there's all kinds of little things.
Got To get used to your feet.

1140
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:53.460
Gotta get prepared,
you're going to get weird muscles,

1141
01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:55.800
your back's got to get stronger,
you're going to get,
you know,

1142
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.240
calluses all over your feet.

1143
01:21:57.241 --> 01:22:02.241
It takes a special type of fitness regimen to get used to and ready for long

1144
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:04.380
ruck marches.

1145
01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:08.790
And that special fitness regimen is rocking and lots of it.

1146
01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:13.980
So,
uh,
if you want to eventually you can augment that,
you know,

1147
01:22:13.981 --> 01:22:18.570
you can start doing squats,
you can start doing sprints and that'll help you,

1148
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.433
you know,
that's fine.

1149
01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:24.530
But the foundation of the preparation for rock humping should be ruck humping.

1150
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:32.010
And that's what's going to make you good at it.
So did you do that?

1151
01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:36.900
I did.
I did.
And rucking for me,
actually,
oddly enough,

1152
01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.850
is something that I was always good at.
No,

1153
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:45.180
and it's weird because I wasn't the fastest sprinter and I wasn't the best long

1154
01:22:45.181 --> 01:22:49.200
distance runner,
which,
what does that make you?
Make you a loser,
right?

1155
01:22:49.201 --> 01:22:51.300
You can't win a sprint and you can't run a long distance run.

1156
01:22:51.301 --> 01:22:53.490
What's wrong with you?
Yeah.
You're kind of in the middle of that.

1157
01:22:53.491 --> 01:22:58.491
I was in the middle and what I realized was that was good for carrying a

1158
01:22:58.831 --> 01:23:02.430
rucksack.
Yeah.
And I got used to it too because I was a radio man.

1159
01:23:02.431 --> 01:23:05.230
So you always had,
I always had to carry a freaking radio,
you know,

1160
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:09.820
30 pound radio with water,
uh,
batteries and you're just,
it's always heavy.

1161
01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:12.130
You're just sucking it up.
And so I got used to it.

1162
01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:13.900
I suppose it was that more than anything else,

1163
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:19.790
<v 3>you're like,
um,
you're seeing the movie tremors,
TV,
movie,</v>

1164
01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.160
Trevor's Caleb,
there's a time at the end,
they were like,
man,
we need to,

1165
01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:25.950
we need to go to those mountains for those,
you know,
to,

1166
01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:29.340
to avoid the underground worms.
And they were like,
hey,
we could take the cat.

1167
01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:33.980
And he's like,
hey,
it's,
it's slow.
You know,
the cat is a big,
uh,
you know,

1168
01:23:33.981 --> 01:23:35.060
the Bobcat,

1169
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:37.340
<v 5>I don't actually know what a bobcat is.
I'm not sure.</v>

1170
01:23:37.341 --> 01:23:39.230
I know what underground worms

1171
01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.770
<v 3>that's dumps,
that's something completely different,
but their bed,</v>

1172
01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:47.180
so they took the cat and the guy,
the guy was like,
no,

1173
01:23:47.181 --> 01:23:50.080
we can't take the get slower than hell.
And he's like,
it doesn't make a,

1174
01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:53.530
it can carry a ton though.
It,
you know,
it was,
he was like,
you,

1175
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:56.540
you're like the cat.
So they hooked up this big trailer,

1176
01:23:56.870 --> 01:24:00.700
which is the Rock in your chair and you know,
and they,
and they drove everybody,

1177
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:05.130
um,
you know,
to the mountains to walk.
No,
they're trapped on,

1178
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:09.020
on roofs,
on a rooftop.
And they're like,
we're all going to starve up here.

1179
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:12.260
We've got to make it to the mountains.
It's like nine miles.
They're like,

1180
01:24:12.261 --> 01:24:14.390
how are we going to get there?
We can't,
you know,
we can't run.

1181
01:24:14.391 --> 01:24:19.170
They're going to get us.
We can,
you know,
so they'll say we won't get the cat got,

1182
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:21.530
and they were like,
oh,
it's too slow.
But they're like,
yeah,

1183
01:24:21.531 --> 01:24:24.950
but it can carry this big trailer.
You know?

1184
01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:28.080
<v 5>And I used to say that in the seal teams and I got on,</v>

1185
01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:32.120
my opinion was it was better to be built like a four by four and like a Porsche.

1186
01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.270
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was better to be,

1187
01:24:34.271 --> 01:24:37.570
it just cause you got to carry weight around durable.
Yeah.

1188
01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.990
What would you rather have working on a farm?
Uh,

1189
01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:45.380
Ford f three 50 or a Porsche.

1190
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:46.470
Yeah.

1191
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:49.860
I mean abortion is cool for the track when everything's all lined up and dialed

1192
01:24:49.861 --> 01:24:52.800
in the way it's supposed to be,
but you get any kind of terrain going on.

1193
01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:57.090
You want that for before and he wanted it bad.
And so that's why,
you know,

1194
01:24:57.810 --> 01:24:59.640
the seals,
the seals,

1195
01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:04.850
guys that were kind of more a four by four than a Porsche,

1196
01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.000
yes,

1197
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.470
you can be a better in the field in the real seal situations.

1198
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:15.010
You know,
the,
the actual,
because the thing about that's,
that's,

1199
01:25:15.650 --> 01:25:17.910
it's a misconception about the seal teams is,
you know,

1200
01:25:17.911 --> 01:25:21.360
you see guys running on the beach and you see guys swimming in the ocean and

1201
01:25:21.361 --> 01:25:22.710
they never are carrying anything.

1202
01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.670
And that's just complete lie because every time you do anything in the seal

1203
01:25:26.671 --> 01:25:29.160
teams,
you're carrying a ton of weight with you.

1204
01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.210
And so you gotta be built like a four by four and not like a Porsche.

1205
01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:35.350
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
Makes Sense.
So,
yeah,</v>

1206
01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:39.820
he'd way rather someone like you then some sprinter who can run like a four to

1207
01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:42.660
40 but then you put some,
you know,
something on this

1208
01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:47.760
<v 5>is actually,
you know what you,
you just want somebody that's durable.</v>

1209
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:51.480
Yeah.
Durable is the word.
Yeah.

1210
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:56.670
And if they're a great athlete and they can have an awesome 40 time or they can

1211
01:25:56.671 --> 01:26:00.780
run a marathon,
but they're just durable,
it's awesome.
Yeah.
Okay.

1212
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:04.400
I'm not trying to put parameters around the guys cause there's guys,

1213
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:08.720
there was a guy when I was at team too and he was a guy actually went through

1214
01:26:08.721 --> 01:26:13.430
buds with and he was,
he's,

1215
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:18.490
he's kind of a short guy and he was kind of had an odd body shape and so he kind

1216
01:26:22.521 --> 01:26:23.210
of looked,

1217
01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:27.890
he got to have almost like a little pudgy belly and uh,

1218
01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.590
he just was one of those guys.

1219
01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.700
And the funny thing is he could run faster than me and he could bench more than

1220
01:26:34.701 --> 01:26:39.560
me.
Yeah,
no kidding.
It was awesome.
I love that.
Yeah,
he's an awesome guy.

1221
01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:43.070
Awesome guy.
I said,
you know,
that's cool.

1222
01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.490
People say that about him because he's a little bit short and a little bit pouty

1223
01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:48.050
looking.
I'm like,
he can,

1224
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.750
he can actually bench more than me and he can run faster than me.

1225
01:26:50.751 --> 01:26:55.640
He can beat me in all the runs.
So let's just be quiet
right

1226
01:26:57.350 --> 01:27:01.160
next.
Russian.
Jacqueline,
do you think that the military army,

1227
01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:05.960
Navy Air Force is a young man's game because he,
this,

1228
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.230
this guy is 29 years old and he's about to join up.

1229
01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:12.350
He's about to get it on Yemen.
That's awesome.

1230
01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.570
Uh,
two answers to that question

1231
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:22.850
and as usual with answers from me,
the dichotomy,

1232
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:27.080
unfortunately there's a dichotomy and they oppose each other.
Uh,
first of all,

1233
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:31.760
yes.
And anybody that says it's not a young man's game is not telling the truth

1234
01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:37.010
because it's a game where you're going to be on travel,

1235
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:40.070
you're gonna be gone.
You'd be risking your lives at times.

1236
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:42.223
You're going to have to

1237
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:47.750
put up with a lack of comfort in your world.

1238
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:50.840
You're going to be living in barracks.
I bet it's just going to be,
it's not,

1239
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:53.810
it's not creature comforts,
right?
It's the military.

1240
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:55.580
It's a semi spartan environment.

1241
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:59.600
It's not the forgotten Highlander for the love of God,
but it's,

1242
01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:03.410
but it's definitely more spartan than what the average person has in regular

1243
01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:04.244
life.

1244
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:09.920
So to anybody to say it's not a young man's game is,

1245
01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:14.240
is not telling the truth because it absolutely is.
And for me,
you know,

1246
01:28:14.241 --> 01:28:18.590
I joined when I was a kid when I was 18 years old and it was awesome.

1247
01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.630
I had no attachments in life.

1248
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.490
Like I went to the MEP station with nothing with,
that's the,

1249
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:29.420
that's the recruiting station where you actually go and I forget what it stands

1250
01:28:29.421 --> 01:28:33.770
for,
but it's where you actually leave for the military.
And I had no,

1251
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.610
I had nothing there.
Oh,
do you need to store anything?
No.
What's your,

1252
01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:41.350
you know where you send your mail?
I don't get mail.
Hold Mail.

1253
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:45.470
There is no mail that's sent to me with a blank slate.
And that's awesome.

1254
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.720
You don't think about family,
you don't think about anything.

1255
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.360
You just get in there and you'd get your job done.
And if they say,
hey,

1256
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:53.030
we're going to deploy you tomorrow for the next eight years,
you say,
cool,

1257
01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:57.650
let's do you.
Let's bring it Dang and aid.

1258
01:28:57.651 --> 01:29:01.770
You have a obedient nature because you don't know any better.
You know,

1259
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.400
you joined the military,
you're,
you're stoked.
You're getting a paycheck.

1260
01:29:05.401 --> 01:29:09.840
All of a sudden,
you know,
you got three hots and a cot.
It's all good.

1261
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:12.870
You know?
Whereas when you're,
as you know,

1262
01:29:12.871 --> 01:29:17.871
when you're 17 years old and you're not quite putting things together yet Yab

1263
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:20.220
and all of a sudden,
like I said,
you got a paycheck,

1264
01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:22.080
you've got three hots and a cot,
you ready to rock and roll.

1265
01:29:22.081 --> 01:29:26.160
They tell you what you do,
you do it.
That's good.

1266
01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:29.340
So it's a young man's game.
Now that being said,

1267
01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:33.360
of course there's a dichotomy to that and that is that the military,

1268
01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:39.590
is it always in need of guys that are mature and smart and have experienced in

1269
01:29:40.771 --> 01:29:43.950
life,
right?
That you need to have people like that.

1270
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.620
Now you get them eventually through the military,

1271
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:51.120
but it's also good to have people that won't raised in the military environment

1272
01:29:51.121 --> 01:29:53.940
so they can always have a little bit of an outer view and you can learn a little

1273
01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:54.774
bit from them.

1274
01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.900
But what you have to get over is all those things that the young guy can eat for

1275
01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:03.810
breakfast.
Right.
You know,
if you're 29 years old,

1276
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:07.050
there's a decent chance you've had a pretty nice apartment somewhere.

1277
01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:13.020
There's a decent chance you slept in until you know,
nine 45 on the weekends.

1278
01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:15.900
There's a decent chance that you stayed out until two o'clock in the morning and

1279
01:30:15.901 --> 01:30:17.370
partied and you know,

1280
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.910
brought a girl back and you slept in until nine and you might be doing that on

1281
01:30:20.911 --> 01:30:25.110
the regular,
you know what I mean?
You got some clothes,
you're watching cable TV,

1282
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:28.410
you got all these things right.
And then the other,
the other part of that,

1283
01:30:28.411 --> 01:30:30.610
as you might have a family,
you know,
you might have life,

1284
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:35.100
you might have kids at 29 years old.
Yeah,
you might be established,

1285
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:36.840
you might have people relying on you,

1286
01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:40.920
not just financially but emotionally just to be there.

1287
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:42.900
So how are you going to cut all that away?

1288
01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:46.320
That's the challenge for the older guy.
Now,

1289
01:30:46.321 --> 01:30:49.380
some older guys that are 29 years old,
they don't have any of that yet.
If,

1290
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:52.350
if so best case scenario,
you got both.

1291
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:56.070
Now that I'm not telling the 18 year olds to hold off on an on enlisting in the

1292
01:30:56.071 --> 01:30:58.290
military,
don't hold off.
Just get it done.

1293
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:02.370
Get it done and you won't regret it unless you're,

1294
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:05.310
unless you screw up and bring it upon yourself.

1295
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:10.550
But if you are 29 and you can either overcome those obstacles of the things that

1296
01:31:10.621 --> 01:31:12.540
are going to,
the things that are going to,

1297
01:31:13.170 --> 01:31:15.810
things that are going to tear it you emotionally,
right?

1298
01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.070
They're going to tear it you emotionally.

1299
01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.840
Now what's cool is when you're in the military and you're raised in the

1300
01:31:21.841 --> 01:31:26.670
military,
you are

1301
01:31:28.230 --> 01:31:30.690
raised in such a way that those,

1302
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:37.110
those distractions are easily overcome,
right?
You learn how to,

1303
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:40.830
you learn how to compartmentalize those things.
At least I did to say,

1304
01:31:40.831 --> 01:31:41.850
you know what?
Hey,

1305
01:31:41.851 --> 01:31:44.520
I understand it's nice to stay home and sleep in on the weekend,

1306
01:31:44.521 --> 01:31:47.340
but I'm not going to do it.
Right?

1307
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:49.950
It's nice to be able to hang out with your wife and kids,

1308
01:31:49.951 --> 01:31:53.280
but it doesn't matter to me compared to my job.
That's what you end up like,

1309
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:55.980
which is slightly psychopathic,
but it's where you end up,
right?

1310
01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:00.430
It's where it's where I have to tell.
Yeah.
It's where I ended up was,
you know,

1311
01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:02.560
nothing else matters besides the seal teams.

1312
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:07.540
And I don't care about anything else.
So if you want to be in my life,
cool.

1313
01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:09.640
You just got to do it around these giant parameters.

1314
01:32:09.641 --> 01:32:13.960
That's called the CLTs deal with it.
Yeah.

1315
01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:18.880
So join up my brother 29 years old.
Go and get after it.
Do that.

1316
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.140
BTF
next question Jocko.

1317
01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:30.060
When do you cut your losses or give up on something and walk when and how

1318
01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.960
to decide to cut bait?
Not a quitter.

1319
01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:44.000
Too much brain damage.
Brain damage.

1320
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:47.240
It's a word I've been hearing more from the corporate world actually is people

1321
01:32:47.241 --> 01:32:50.180
talk about when something's really hard to do and they're just causing brain

1322
01:32:50.181 --> 01:32:53.330
damage by trying to do it.
Uh,
and this was actually two questions.

1323
01:32:53.331 --> 01:32:57.480
It's obviously a metaphor,
obviously.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's okay.
It's a metaphor for it.

1324
01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:58.250
It's a metaphor for,

1325
01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:00.410
and I talk about when I was like beating my head against the wall,

1326
01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:07.300
and this is one of those things that confuses people because everyone hears,

1327
01:33:07.371 --> 01:33:09.230
including us in the seal teams,

1328
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:14.330
we hear the mantra of never ever quit,

1329
01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:19.610
never quit.
And it's not just a mantra that we say,
it's actually,

1330
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:23.210
it's actually what we believe.
Yeah.

1331
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:26.660
And furthermore,

1332
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:30.650
it's not just what we say and it's not just what we believe,

1333
01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:36.320
but it's literally how we act.
So

1334
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.540
that that drive and that attitude of never quit.

1335
01:33:41.541 --> 01:33:46.040
It's a powerful force and it does push you over the edge to victory,

1336
01:33:47.630 --> 01:33:50.180
to victory in many cases.

1337
01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:55.013
But,

1338
01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:59.820
and there's always a dichotomy to just about everything.

1339
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:04.800
There's a dichotomy to this too,
because over that attitude,

1340
01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.280
you have to layer something on top of that.

1341
01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:10.620
And that is

1342
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:17.090
if basically strategic vision and understanding of

1343
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:24.000
the battlefield as a whole.
So you know,
it's like the,

1344
01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:28.790
the,
the saying of win the battle,

1345
01:34:28.791 --> 01:34:32.630
lose the war.
This is the opposite,
right?
Win The battle.
Lose the war.
Meaning,

1346
01:34:32.631 --> 01:34:35.420
oh you,
you stick to it right now and you might win right now,

1347
01:34:35.421 --> 01:34:39.080
but in the long run you're going to lose.
This is the opposite where you,

1348
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:41.540
you're going to say,
you know what,
I'm going to lose this battle right now,

1349
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:43.550
but I'm going to win the war in the long run.

1350
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:49.390
So you absolutely need to know when you got to stop beating your head against

1351
01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:51.740
the wall.

1352
01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:56.740
You've got to know that I personally draw my limit at 27 times after a beating

1353
01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.790
head against the wall 27 times on the 28th time,
I'm going to say,

1354
01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:03.890
you know what?
I bet there's another way to do this.

1355
01:35:03.891 --> 01:35:08.870
Or maybe this isn't a battle worth fighting.
Now the main reason

1356
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:15.520
I think why people get caught in the trap of banging their head against the wall

1357
01:35:15.650 --> 01:35:18.920
or not knowing when to quit is because,
and again,

1358
01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:23.240
quit is a strong word and it's almost hard for me to say right now because it's

1359
01:35:23.241 --> 01:35:27.350
not knowing when to quit then.
I'm not talking about quitting.
I'm talking about,

1360
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:28.340
yeah,
no,

1361
01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:33.340
I'm talking about making it a strategic assessment of an unwinnable situation

1362
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:39.430
and deciding to disengage only so you can reengage with superior firepower and

1363
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:45.620
crush the enemy.
Yeah.
So there's a big difference between that and quitting.

1364
01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.300
Quitting means you curl up into a ball and wait to die.
That's what quitting is.

1365
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:53.810
And,
uh,
I know it's a board that under any circumstances,

1366
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:59.990
so when do you,
when does it happen?
Where it happens?

1367
01:35:59.991 --> 01:36:01.610
Because people get emotional,

1368
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:06.590
they get too emotional about whatever obstacles in front of them and they get

1369
01:36:06.591 --> 01:36:11.591
crazy about it and they start seeing the obstacle as not only the battle but

1370
01:36:11.751 --> 01:36:13.070
also as the war.

1371
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.720
And they get lost in their own determination.

1372
01:36:20.710 --> 01:36:23.030
And I've seen this with some seal buddies of mine,

1373
01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:28.140
they are so determined that they will not stop even when it's completely

1374
01:36:29.721 --> 01:36:34.310
detrimental,
you know?
And,
and they do it with just about everything.

1375
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:37.160
You know,
there'll be determined that anything,
you know,

1376
01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:40.400
there'll be hurting themselves.
Training,
there'll be,
you know,

1377
01:36:40.401 --> 01:36:43.880
determined to drink harder than anybody else.
They'll,
I mean,
it just,

1378
01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:47.660
anything you can throw at them and they're determined to win at that and it

1379
01:36:47.661 --> 01:36:52.220
actually losing.
Um,
so,

1380
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:57.030
so how do you prevent that from happening is you have to,
again,

1381
01:36:57.050 --> 01:37:01.430
common theme here,
you have to detach.
You have to detach yourself.
You have to

1382
01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.130
be able to step back away from the problem enough to look at it from a strategic

1383
01:37:07.131 --> 01:37:10.880
viewpoint and say,
okay,
what's,
what's going on here?
What's the risk?

1384
01:37:10.881 --> 01:37:14.690
What's the reward?
How much am I willing to sacrifice right now?

1385
01:37:14.691 --> 01:37:19.250
And how is that sacrifice going to impact me tomorrow or the next day or next

1386
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:20.083
week?

1387
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:26.470
And then once you've detached and you've weighed and you've seen what the real

1388
01:37:26.901 --> 01:37:30.950
value of the this immediate objective is,

1389
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:36.850
then you can assess and make a logical decision based not on your emotion but on

1390
01:37:40.371 --> 01:37:45.110
the actual impact of the situation in the overall strategic picture.

1391
01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:49.360
Yeah.
That,
um,
uh,

1392
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:54.320
you're saying when you weigh the detriment and the in the rewards,

1393
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.690
<v 3>I think that that really makes it real clear when you can assess and be like,
oh,</v>

1394
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:04.500
all of this,
we're getting all this,
like all these,

1395
01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:09.030
this detrimental stuff when we're trying to get this,
you know,

1396
01:38:09.031 --> 01:38:10.980
this one benefit,
you know,

1397
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.920
out of this person or out of this situation or whatever.
And when you're,

1398
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:17.400
you're using up your resources are sacrificing more resources than you are

1399
01:38:17.401 --> 01:38:21.570
gaining ground,
then you know that that seems like a clear time to it.

1400
01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:24.540
At the very least,
start thinking about disengaging

1401
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:27.120
<v 5>and you got it.
You got to detach to bill notice out,</v>

1402
01:38:27.121 --> 01:38:28.530
and I noticed this in Jujitsu all the time.

1403
01:38:28.531 --> 01:38:31.870
People try and pass pass and Garner sucks.
Simplest example.
Yeah.

1404
01:38:32.010 --> 01:38:36.360
People just like do one guard pass and it doesn't work and they do it again and

1405
01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:38.190
it doesn't work and they do it again.
It doesn't work.
They do,

1406
01:38:38.191 --> 01:38:40.950
they get and they go on and on and on until they're exhausted.

1407
01:38:41.690 --> 01:38:44.260
They get mounted and then they get put to dap

1408
01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:49.320
and it's because they were stubborn and they didn't detach and say,

1409
01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:54.210
I mean after you've tried to pass a guy's guard 14 times in a row the same way

1410
01:38:54.211 --> 01:38:56.790
and it hasn't worked,
why is it going to work the 15th time?

1411
01:38:57.150 --> 01:39:00.810
The answer is it's not.
Try something else.

1412
01:39:01.130 --> 01:39:04.070
Keep trying to think of a solid solid answer to that.

1413
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:06.370
There is no solid and it's the same thing.

1414
01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:07.950
You should see this putting seals through training,

1415
01:39:07.951 --> 01:39:12.900
they'd get like bogged down in a bad situation and they would,
um,

1416
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:18.090
they would,
they would just be,
start,
get focused on that one problem,
you know,

1417
01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:20.970
one room in the building,
they'd be like,
no,
send more guys into it.

1418
01:39:20.971 --> 01:39:21.900
Send more guys into it.

1419
01:39:21.901 --> 01:39:25.260
Everyone just getting sprayed with paint ball and put down in the training

1420
01:39:25.261 --> 01:39:29.370
operation and no two more guys.
And eventually everyone's just,
you know,

1421
01:39:29.371 --> 01:39:33.330
it's trading but everyone's dead and they're loading order up and you just

1422
01:39:33.331 --> 01:39:35.280
didn't,
they got focused on it and it costs them.

1423
01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.110
So the leader's got to be able to step back and detach and take a look at the

1424
01:39:40.111 --> 01:39:42.240
situation and decide,
you know what,

1425
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.960
<v 3>I'm going to go ahead and change course right now.
Not going to quit,</v>

1426
01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.540
but I'm going to adjust.
Make a strategic adjustment.
Yeah.
And,
and that's,

1427
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:57.560
it's weird how those semantics can really change your outlook on the whole task.

1428
01:39:57.561 --> 01:39:57.920
When you,

1429
01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.920
when you use the word quit versus disengage or another one with quit,

1430
01:40:03.411 --> 01:40:06.470
like I said,
is give up,
you know,
like give it up.
I mean,

1431
01:40:06.471 --> 01:40:08.810
unless it's something negative like smoking or something like that,
you know,

1432
01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:10.760
quit smoking,
you're going to give up smoking,
that's good.

1433
01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.230
But obviously smoking to negative,

1434
01:40:12.231 --> 01:40:14.780
but any kind of task or anything that requires effort,

1435
01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:19.280
if you quit or quote unquote give up,
it's like,

1436
01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:24.680
it's hard to have that sound like a good thing,
you know?
Yeah.

1437
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.780
And

1438
01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:30.520
<v 5>one thing that's,
this is,
you know,
obviously it applies to combat,</v>

1439
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.700
it applies to Jujitsu as we just talked about.
But also,
you know,

1440
01:40:33.701 --> 01:40:37.420
you look at what you're doing day to day and the little things in your life that

1441
01:40:37.421 --> 01:40:40.570
you're trying to make work or in a business that you're trying to make something

1442
01:40:40.571 --> 01:40:44.530
happen.
And sometimes people get so addicted to their plan,

1443
01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:47.950
they get,
so their ego is wrapped around their plan.

1444
01:40:47.951 --> 01:40:52.951
Their plan is like 50% 50% tactics and technique and it's percent their own ego.

1445
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:59.440
And so when you try it with that person's plan starts to fail,
guess what?

1446
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:02.180
They don't want to let it go because it's all wrapped up in their ego.

1447
01:41:02.181 --> 01:41:05.500
So they just push it further,
push it further,
they push it further.

1448
01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:08.500
And especially if that person's in a senior position,

1449
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.950
well then everyone's kind of just fallen in line and they're looking at them.

1450
01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.100
They all know,
they all know where they're at,
the bottom of the chain of command.

1451
01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:18.940
And I'll look into this person saying,
hey buddy,
it's not working.

1452
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:24.010
Let's disengage and fall back in,

1453
01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:25.720
figure out a new plan of attack.

1454
01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.300
And then let's reapproach the target from a different angle.

1455
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:29.740
Let's flank this target.

1456
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.310
So if you're in a business,

1457
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:36.760
if you're in a relationship relationship,
yeah.

1458
01:41:36.850 --> 01:41:40.120
And you've got a situation where you're trying to make something work a certain

1459
01:41:40.121 --> 01:41:43.120
way and it's not,
maybe it's,

1460
01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:47.350
you got to disengage and you've got to come with a different angle of attack so

1461
01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:49.480
that you can get the big wind.
We had the long run.

1462
01:41:49.730 --> 01:41:53.840
<v 3>Yeah.
And with relationships,
obviously it's,
it's,
it's the same dynamic,</v>

1463
01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:55.750
but it's different because,
um,

1464
01:41:56.410 --> 01:42:00.560
well it's the same because when you're in a,
let's say a boyfriend,

1465
01:42:00.561 --> 01:42:02.840
girlfriend relationship,
whatever you've been husband,
wife,
um,

1466
01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:08.090
you see it's not working.
Let's see.
One of them abusive.
Right.

1467
01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:08.481
Meanwhile,

1468
01:42:08.481 --> 01:42:12.380
the other one's trying to quote unquote make it work and if they end up leaving

1469
01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.060
all you gave up on him,
you know,
he,
you or you,
you could not,

1470
01:42:17.061 --> 01:42:18.980
and I don't think he'd ever say you'd quit the relationship,

1471
01:42:18.981 --> 01:42:22.670
but we'll just say you gave up on the relationship.
Right.
You know,
war.

1472
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:27.620
He's been abusing her for 10 years already,
you know,
or in your case,

1473
01:42:27.621 --> 01:42:32.000
27 years or you know,
whatever the number is.
And um,
and he got to,

1474
01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.440
I do not abuse my wife.
All right.
Right.
But you know,
as far as your numbers go,

1475
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:41.510
27,
um,
but again,
like if you say,
Oh,

1476
01:42:41.511 --> 01:42:44.300
you gave up on the relationship,
it's kind of like,
it's kind of like,

1477
01:42:44.301 --> 01:42:46.790
it's the girl's fault a little bit.
Like maybe she,
she,

1478
01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:51.680
she shouldn't have done that almost,
you know,
but um,
yeah,

1479
01:42:51.681 --> 01:42:53.670
you disengage and if you want to,

1480
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:57.230
if you want to go for the win in that relationship and if you really want to

1481
01:42:57.231 --> 01:42:59.510
maintain the relationship,
don't let it be a husband,
wife relationship.

1482
01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.030
Maybe go back to being neighbors or something.
Like that,

1483
01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.480
even though in an abusive relationship that might not work.

1484
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:07.430
But I'm just saying theoretically.

1485
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:12.140
<v 5>Yeah.
I'm not sure about all that.
Sure.
A man.
Uh,</v>

1486
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:17.770
but I do know that if you find yourself trying repeatedly to make something

1487
01:43:18.261 --> 01:43:21.560
happen and it's not happening,
try a different route.

1488
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:23.630
You don't consider yourself a quitter.

1489
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:28.810
Consider yourself a tech strategist or a tactician.

1490
01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:34.870
<v 1>Good.
Next question.</v>

1491
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.113
Jocko.

1492
01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.630
<v 3>In a fight,
MMA or otherwise,</v>

1493
01:43:45.230 --> 01:43:49.820
would you substitute anger or rage for aggression?

1494
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.490
<v 5>Would I substitute anger or rage for aggression?
This isn't a fight,</v>

1495
01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.320
MMA or otherwise,
that's important actually.

1496
01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:04.660
<v 3>Yeah.
So we,
so just to clarify,
this means like instead of aggression,</v>

1497
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:09.220
is it okay to use anger or rage?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well,

1498
01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:16.160
<v 5>I think pretty obviously,
and people will just expect the answer to be for me,</v>

1499
01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:17.690
the initial answer here is no,

1500
01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:22.691
and I would not substitute anger or rage for aggressiveness.

1501
01:44:24.150 --> 01:44:27.950
Uh,
I think obviously when you let rage takeover you,

1502
01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:32.000
you're not thinking anymore.
Yeah.
And the mind

1503
01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:37.460
is allegedly the most important weapon.
And I actually believe that to be true.

1504
01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:40.010
So if you let your rage and anger take over,

1505
01:44:40.011 --> 01:44:42.950
you're not using your mind and that's not good.

1506
01:44:42.951 --> 01:44:46.610
And you actually get to see this in MMA on a fairly regular basis because you'll

1507
01:44:46.611 --> 01:44:51.270
get somebody that is really good at talking smack.
Yeah.

1508
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:53.600
And they'll get into the other person's head.

1509
01:44:53.601 --> 01:44:56.030
What does it mean to get the other person's head?
What does it do to them?

1510
01:44:56.330 --> 01:45:01.010
Does it make them sad?
No.
Does it make them not hate the opponent?
No.

1511
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.870
What does it do to them?
It makes them angry.
Yeah.
It makes them frustrated.

1512
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:09.560
And that anger leads to frustration,

1513
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:13.230
which leads to defeat.

1514
01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.630
So,
and again,

1515
01:45:18.631 --> 01:45:23.631
I think it's important to recognize that this doesn't just occur in MMA.

1516
01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.970
It occurs in everyday life.

1517
01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.130
And a good example is when you get in a conversation with somebody,

1518
01:45:29.131 --> 01:45:32.280
you get to debate with somebody.
You get in an argument with somebody,

1519
01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:38.430
the minute you get frustrated or angry or enraged,

1520
01:45:38.730 --> 01:45:41.490
users lost the argument.
Yeah.
Right.
I mean,
you might,

1521
01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:46.980
you might feel like you won.
Right.
But you will not win the argument.
You,

1522
01:45:46.981 --> 01:45:49.560
you lost the argument.
Yeah.
I mean at that that happens.

1523
01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:51.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1524
01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:55.350
<v 3>Yeah.
In any,
uh,
yes,
but she fits in a debate men,</v>

1525
01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:57.540
because it's an understood,
you're debating,

1526
01:45:57.541 --> 01:45:59.370
you're kind of against each other and then it's,

1527
01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:01.860
he just went off the rails basically.
Right?
Yeah.

1528
01:46:01.861 --> 01:46:04.440
It's not good to lose your temper in a debate,

1529
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:08.280
in a conversation or in an MMA match.
Like if you're playing chess,

1530
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:11.340
we were playing chess and I was talking smack to you.

1531
01:46:11.341 --> 01:46:14.450
You got frustrated in the flipped over the chess board.
Yeah.

1532
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:17.580
You're right with the,
with the,
um,
you know,

1533
01:46:17.581 --> 01:46:20.190
a display of monumental power or whatever,

1534
01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:25.230
whatever that was [inaudible] Jackson for age.
Yes.
Yeah.
You won.
You lost

1535
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:30.700
<v 5>in a way.
Yeah.
You,
you absolutely.
This.
Um,</v>

1536
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:34.600
so,
uh,
I,
you know,
I talk about this all the time,

1537
01:46:34.601 --> 01:46:39.601
is that the rule is he'd never let your emotion get in control so you don't let

1538
01:46:39.881 --> 01:46:43.630
anger,
rage,
overwhelm your little brain.

1539
01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:50.130
Now here's the,
here's other side of that coin.

1540
01:46:50.131 --> 01:46:51.240
Here's the dichotomy.

1541
01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:55.440
And I don't think you can even argue against this because it's,

1542
01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:58.140
that's pretty sound argument,
right?
I mean what we just said.
I mean,

1543
01:46:58.141 --> 01:47:00.270
we've seen it,
we know we know for a fact,

1544
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:06.360
but rules are made to be broken.
Um,
there are times,

1545
01:47:07.670 --> 01:47:08.270
<v 1>okay,</v>

1546
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:11.900
<v 5>we'd,
emotion can increase performance.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

1547
01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:16.730
There absolutely are.
And I remember when I was a kid growing up,
the,

1548
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:20.450
the Soviet Union was still just hardcore communist.

1549
01:47:21.650 --> 01:47:24.980
And when I would watch like the Olympics,

1550
01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:29.300
they would be like machines,
the Soviets,
no emotions.
And I thought,
man,

1551
01:47:29.301 --> 01:47:32.330
those guys are bad ass.
I wanted to be like that

1552
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:37.880
and often brought him victories.
But I heard a quote when I was a kid and I,

1553
01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:40.610
I actually looked for it cause I wanted to bring it up.
I couldn't find it,

1554
01:47:40.611 --> 01:47:44.870
but it was something along the lines of this.
And that was that Soviet,

1555
01:47:44.871 --> 01:47:47.660
the Soviet athletes perform better in practice,

1556
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:51.370
but the Americans perform better in the stadium.
Hmm.

1557
01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:55.010
So the Americans,

1558
01:47:55.011 --> 01:47:57.770
and that's not a universal statement and there's plenty of examples of the

1559
01:47:57.771 --> 01:47:59.270
Russians beaten Americans and whatever.

1560
01:47:59.271 --> 01:48:04.271
But there's also examples of where the Americans with their emotion and their

1561
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:11.870
fire,
we're able to beat these Russians.
And,
I mean,

1562
01:48:11.871 --> 01:48:16.070
the greatest example would be the miracle on Iceland in Lake Placid,

1563
01:48:16.071 --> 01:48:17.840
New York in 1980 which is,
you know,

1564
01:48:17.841 --> 01:48:22.760
that was a bunch of college kids that were fired up to beat the hardened Russian

1565
01:48:22.761 --> 01:48:24.860
professional hockey team.
Yeah.

1566
01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:28.070
And it's because,
you know,

1567
01:48:28.071 --> 01:48:31.550
they kind of trained their emotions out of it and there's a great time to have

1568
01:48:31.551 --> 01:48:34.430
your emotions trained out of it.
You know,
there's a great time where you're like,

1569
01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:37.970
you know what,
I'm not gonna let my emotions play into this.
I heard a,

1570
01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:43.570
I heard something about tiger woods and his golf game and he's not thinking

1571
01:48:45.681 --> 01:48:50.210
about,
you know,
the,
the broad statement is when he's hitting a shot to golf,

1572
01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:55.280
he's not thinking about the last shot and he's not thinking about the next shot.

1573
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:56.810
He's just thinking about that shot right there.

1574
01:48:57.410 --> 01:49:00.650
So there's no emotional of whether he's buying at or behind or nothing else.

1575
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:04.610
He just is there on that one shot.
So

1576
01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:09.010
I think that,
you know,
we,

1577
01:49:09.970 --> 01:49:12.820
I think that people you meet Americans is the example I used.

1578
01:49:12.821 --> 01:49:17.440
But I think that people in general can use your emotion to,

1579
01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:22.120
to your advantage sometimes,
but

1580
01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:26.840
it does take control and it takes direction.

1581
01:49:26.841 --> 01:49:31.640
And also I think it's important to remember that it doesn't take long for that

1582
01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:36.700
extra fire of anger to go from making you stronger and faster to making you

1583
01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:44.800
slower and weaker both mentally and physically so you can get that burst.

1584
01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:45.830
Then,
you know,

1585
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:48.280
you see this in fighting all the time where people punch themselves out.

1586
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:49.143
You know,
they go,

1587
01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:53.290
they go level seven rage and they start swinging for the fence and excitement

1588
01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.410
even.
Yeah.
Or excitement.
They think the guy,
they think they got the guy in the,

1589
01:49:56.411 --> 01:49:59.440
in the hurt locker,
they come,
they bring the thunder for,
they get,

1590
01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:00.880
they get emotional.
Yup.

1591
01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:07.480
And I think on the mat when you get a guy that loses his temper,

1592
01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:09.910
when,
when somebody loses their temper with me on the map,

1593
01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:13.810
it's just a matter of time.
Like I just go,
okay,
cool.
He's got,
you know,

1594
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:18.010
he's got three minutes left because he's going to be done.
So

1595
01:50:21.330 --> 01:50:23.070
yeah,
you've got to stay calm.
Now.

1596
01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:27.540
A couple of situations that I've seen or been a participant in,
uh,

1597
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:31.530
and I'm pretty sure,
I was trying to remember this for sure,

1598
01:50:31.710 --> 01:50:36.710
but I was cornering Jeremy Stephens and if you don't know Jeremy Stevens is

1599
01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:40.860
little heath and MMA,
awesome guy,
stud fighter.

1600
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:45.320
And we were training him at the time and he was fighting,
I,

1601
01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:50.010
I'm pretty sure it was against Marcus Davis,
who's a well-respected boxer,

1602
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:56.160
really good MMA fighter as well,
but definitely known for his boxing.

1603
01:50:56.161 --> 01:50:58.410
Well,
Jeremy is known for his striking as well.

1604
01:50:58.411 --> 01:51:03.411
He's a very powerful striker and he's got unbelievable one punch knockout power

1605
01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:05.820
Jeremy does.

1606
01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:11.550
So I was and Jeremy and it was a really,

1607
01:51:11.551 --> 01:51:15.900
really close fight,
Amit.
It was a,
I didn't know if he was winning or losing,

1608
01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.600
I think it was leaning towards Marcus actually.

1609
01:51:19.710 --> 01:51:23.580
And there's three rounds in MMA in this,
in this fight.

1610
01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.810
And in between the second and the third round,

1611
01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:33.090
I got in the ring,
got in the cage with Jeremy and I,

1612
01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:35.190
I did the full on,
you know,

1613
01:51:35.250 --> 01:51:39.360
in his face and I know I gave him the,
hey listen,

1614
01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:40.830
this is what's going on.

1615
01:51:41.190 --> 01:51:45.150
This guy across the ring from you is taking money off your kid's table is taken

1616
01:51:45.151 --> 01:51:47.970
food off your kid's table,
was going to take the roof off their heads.

1617
01:51:48.150 --> 01:51:49.680
He's taken everything that you've worked for.

1618
01:51:49.681 --> 01:51:52.080
He's going to take it from you right now.
You got to get pissed.

1619
01:51:52.081 --> 01:51:54.440
You got to go in there,
you got to destroy him.
And I got,
you know,

1620
01:51:54.450 --> 01:51:57.690
I got to give him a fired up speech like that and you could see it switch in his

1621
01:51:57.691 --> 01:51:58.524
eyes.

1622
01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:03.180
He realized like he went into a rage of I need to kill this guy.

1623
01:52:03.710 --> 01:52:06.690
And he came out that round and knocked him out.
Yeah,
I remember that.

1624
01:52:07.110 --> 01:52:11.400
And that's one.
I'll tell you another one I saw that was,

1625
01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:15.390
it was the same.
So it was,

1626
01:52:15.450 --> 01:52:19.500
it was Carlos Condit versus Rory Macdonald.

1627
01:52:19.590 --> 01:52:20.460
And this was,

1628
01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:26.790
this was the first time they fought.
I pretty sure it was in Canada.
I was there,

1629
01:52:26.791 --> 01:52:27.900
I forget who I was cornering,

1630
01:52:27.901 --> 01:52:32.610
but I was there and I was done with corn or whoever's cornering.

1631
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:37.950
And
I want to say it was Peterson Bodegas Corner,
I think it was up in Canada.

1632
01:52:38.370 --> 01:52:40.470
But um,

1633
01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:46.820
so Carlos condit versus Roy MacDonald and Carlos,

1634
01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:50.450
who's the veteran is going up the get the kid,
you know,

1635
01:52:50.451 --> 01:52:52.850
Roy McDonald was in kind of an,
he was an unknown,

1636
01:52:52.851 --> 01:52:56.210
but he was definitely the younger,
I think he was 20 years old.

1637
01:52:56.690 --> 01:53:01.400
You're just a kid.
No offense Rory.
But he was young,
you know what I mean?
Bad Ass.

1638
01:53:01.401 --> 01:53:05.000
But young and Carlos was the vet,
you know what I mean?
He was a veteran,

1639
01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:09.440
grown man with a wife and kids and man,

1640
01:53:09.441 --> 01:53:12.310
Rory was getting the better versus in front of Rory is hometown.

1641
01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.240
Well I don't know if it's his hometown,
but it was a Canada.

1642
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:18.140
And so the crowd was absolutely supporting Rory,
at least.

1643
01:53:18.141 --> 01:53:20.720
I'm pretty sure I remember this right.
I'm sorry if I don't,

1644
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:25.340
but it seemed like the crowd was on the side of Rory Macdonald.
Hmm.

1645
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:30.320
So in between.
So I'm just watching the fight,

1646
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:34.610
but I had snaked some really good seats.
So I had a really good view,
by the way,

1647
01:53:34.611 --> 01:53:37.580
when I go to UFC,
thanks Dana white and the rest of the crew,

1648
01:53:37.581 --> 01:53:40.880
like I sneak it is some awesome seats after I get done corner again,
people.

1649
01:53:40.881 --> 01:53:44.210
So thank you.
So I was sitting,
you know,
in the second row or something,

1650
01:53:44.211 --> 01:53:45.950
phenomenal seat that I'd snuck into.

1651
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:49.160
And because they throw you in the cheap seats when you're,

1652
01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:52.910
when you're cornering people and you come out to watch the fights and yeah,

1653
01:53:52.911 --> 01:53:54.920
you're up in the nosebleeds,
which was,
is it cool?

1654
01:53:54.921 --> 01:53:57.770
So I just get aggressive and tactically move to better positions,

1655
01:53:58.430 --> 01:54:01.430
which is using the second row right behind the press box.
Sure.

1656
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:06.910
So I'm sitting down there and I'm watching the fight and Greg Jackson is

1657
01:54:07.341 --> 01:54:11.480
cornering Carlos condit.
Now,
if you don't know anything about Greg Jackson,
he's,

1658
01:54:12.170 --> 01:54:16.840
he's present like guy.
And I've actually,
uh,

1659
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:18.530
going back in the day,

1660
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:23.360
going way back in the day when Dean and I were competing all the time in the

1661
01:54:23.361 --> 01:54:26.570
kind of the sole cow scene of grappling,

1662
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:32.420
we would,
we do every competition there was competing all the time.
Grappling,

1663
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:36.650
I don't even remember there were,
there are so many of them that we do at hand.

1664
01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:41.450
Uh,
Greg Jackson would bring guys out to,
to fight to compete.

1665
01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:45.350
And so like we wrestled against these guys,
you know,
are,
we did submission,

1666
01:54:45.351 --> 01:54:47.330
grappling gets these guys.
So I kind of knew him from that.

1667
01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:51.320
And then surprisingly one time when the UFC was in San Diego,

1668
01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:56.240
I was at work at the seal teams and someone called and said,
hey,
there's a,

1669
01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:00.200
there's a guy from the UFC here,
do you want to give them a tour of,
you know,

1670
01:55:00.230 --> 01:55:03.170
he wants a tour there.
The UFC set up a tour of the seal teams.

1671
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:07.190
They want to show him around like the facility facilities,
you know,

1672
01:55:07.191 --> 01:55:10.760
the whatever soum some guns,
you know,
just the gear,
whatever.

1673
01:55:11.210 --> 01:55:13.430
So I show up and it's Greg Jackson.
And you know,

1674
01:55:13.431 --> 01:55:17.450
we kind of had a little bit of recognition,
but,
uh,
anyways,

1675
01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:19.280
Greg Jackson and you know,

1676
01:55:19.281 --> 01:55:22.970
you kinda hear this stuff about Greg Jackson all the time that he's this really

1677
01:55:22.971 --> 01:55:27.350
nice guy and that he's super mellow and that he's really humble.
Well,

1678
01:55:27.351 --> 01:55:31.040
it's all freaking true.
He's a super nice guy.
He's super humble,

1679
01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:34.230
he's just a fantastic guy.
And,
uh,

1680
01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:37.340
I gave him a tour and so we kind of got to know each other and then,
you know,

1681
01:55:37.341 --> 01:55:42.050
going fast forward now in the UFC,
I,
I've,
I've cornered him several times.

1682
01:55:42.051 --> 01:55:44.560
I don't know how many times I've against him,
you
know,
against them.

1683
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:49.470
My fighters are fighting his fighters.
Yeah.
Uh,
and you know,
like I said,

1684
01:55:49.471 --> 01:55:52.740
he's a really like a really mellow and a zen like guy.

1685
01:55:52.741 --> 01:55:55.170
If you watch them in the corners of his fights,
he's always like that,

1686
01:55:55.171 --> 01:55:56.640
just very steady and hey,

1687
01:55:56.641 --> 01:55:59.760
this is what you need to do and you need to watch out for this or whatever.

1688
01:56:01.410 --> 01:56:05.160
So I'm watching this fight and like I said,

1689
01:56:05.161 --> 01:56:09.960
Carlos Condit versus Roy MacDonald.
Carlos is not winning,
right?
He's not winning.

1690
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:15.000
And between
the second and the third round,

1691
01:56:16.590 --> 01:56:20.430
Greg Jackson goes full Bismarck or boat on content.

1692
01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:24.030
I mean he is yelling at him,
he is in his face.
He's pointing at him,

1693
01:56:24.031 --> 01:56:28.920
he's waving his finger.
He's just going nuts on him.
And I was like,
damn,

1694
01:56:29.250 --> 01:56:34.250
Greg Jackson is bringing the heat and sure enough he amped up Carlos Condit

1695
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:39.290
Carlos condit came out and finished Rory and the third which have a fight,

1696
01:56:40.261 --> 01:56:41.490
he was definitely going to lose.

1697
01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:46.640
So what you see there is emotion helping to win in that situation.

1698
01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.640
Yeah.
And uh,
actually when the fight was over,

1699
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.930
I saw Greg and I just kind of said something to him,
you know,
like,

1700
01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:02.580
hey,
you went full Berserker Bodog are Carlos?

1701
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:07.230
And he said,
yeah,
he's like,
I had to do it.
It is funny.
It's,
you could see it.

1702
01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:09.120
It almost seemed like he'd never done it before.
I don't know.

1703
01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:11.820
Maybe we'll have to have Greg on at some point he can tell the story.

1704
01:57:12.210 --> 01:57:15.150
But he said something along the lines of,
you know,
I,

1705
01:57:15.630 --> 01:57:19.320
I had to do it and it worked.
So you know what,
he had a big smile and,

1706
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:24.210
and that was working it.
And it definitely indeed it did work.
Yeah.

1707
01:57:24.211 --> 01:57:28.410
And those,
would you,
do you think,
I mean there's total guess,

1708
01:57:28.411 --> 01:57:33.411
but do you think that's because those just happened to be the exceptions or is

1709
01:57:35.011 --> 01:57:37.290
it because really the formula kind of seems like

1710
01:57:38.850 --> 01:57:43.830
here's the emotion and then here's all the logic and the skill and the planning,

1711
01:57:43.831 --> 01:57:46.440
implementation of,
of you know,
game plans and all this,

1712
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:49.410
all this stuff that you're going to use in your,
in your mind.

1713
01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:50.940
And here's the emotion.

1714
01:57:50.941 --> 01:57:55.941
It's like it's like us a little spark plug or something and then I'm sure the

1715
01:57:56.911 --> 01:58:00.360
emotion can go up,
but the skill got to go up proportionately.

1716
01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:03.510
And once he'd start to do this,
when the emotion takes over,

1717
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:07.500
that's when you know when you're going to fail or,
or to take advantage.

1718
01:58:07.501 --> 01:58:12.480
So think there's a sweet spot in there where for moments in time,

1719
01:58:13.710 --> 01:58:18.240
emotion and even border lining on rage,

1720
01:58:18.241 --> 01:58:20.700
which I think range is a little bit strong because I think rage,

1721
01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.740
you lose your clarity,
but anger,

1722
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:26.580
which is you can still have some clarity of what you're doing.
Right.

1723
01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:29.730
So I think you can actually,

1724
01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:33.750
that can be utilized appropriately at the right times.
And I think these times,

1725
01:58:33.751 --> 01:58:35.910
you know,
like I talked about with Jeremy,
you know,

1726
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:39.780
I had to provoke some anger out him.
Yeah.
You know,

1727
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:42.920
I had to provoke and it absolutely helped him.
He's gonna lose that fight.
Yeah.

1728
01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:44.860
And it's the same thing with Carlos.

1729
01:58:44.861 --> 01:58:48.820
Carlos was absolutely going to lose that fight if he didn't do something

1730
01:58:48.821 --> 01:58:52.420
different.
If he didn't,
you know,
it's like,
it's like hitting the turbo button.

1731
01:58:52.421 --> 01:58:55.000
It's like hitting up when nitrous oxide,
right?

1732
01:58:55.001 --> 01:58:57.580
It's not going to take a hit in the blue,
the nitrous oxide blower.

1733
01:58:57.670 --> 01:59:01.720
It's only going to get you,
it's only gonna make you go hard for another,

1734
01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:06.070
what is it,
another two minutes or,
well,
without nitrous oxide,

1735
01:59:06.071 --> 01:59:10.240
it's not very long at all.
But yeah,
but with,
but with anger,
you know,

1736
01:59:10.241 --> 01:59:15.040
it can make you go for another,
you know,
whatever.

1737
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:17.950
Maybe it's,
maybe it's two minutes and this is something else.

1738
01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:21.730
Have you ever missed like a heavy single,
like,
like Yoga,
you're lifting,

1739
01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:24.700
you're deadlifting or you're doing power cleans or something and you miss a

1740
01:59:24.701 --> 01:59:29.480
heavy signal.
No,
I,
no,
you've never heard so.

1741
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:33.130
So this is another easy way to prove it,
man.

1742
01:59:33.131 --> 01:59:37.570
I miss a heavy signal sometimes and sometimes I just get angry.

1743
01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:38.530
It's true.

1744
01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:42.460
And I just have to bring the anger and I start getting fired up and I start

1745
01:59:42.461 --> 01:59:45.150
thinking about things that make me angry.
Yeah.

1746
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:49.270
And I get over that bar and I ripped that thing off the floor.
Like I hate it.

1747
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:53.350
Yes.
And it absolutely makes me stronger that moment.
So is that a dress?

1748
01:59:53.351 --> 01:59:56.560
Probably adrenaline and it's probably the same thing that pumped into Marcus's

1749
01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:58.510
or oriented Jeremy's head.

1750
01:59:58.511 --> 02:00:01.300
It's probably the same thing that park pumped into Carlos's head.

1751
02:00:01.630 --> 02:00:05.590
But it's crazy because despite getting punched,
despite getting beaten,

1752
02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:07.510
despite having someone,
you know,

1753
02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:10.420
trying to destroy you in front of a large crowd of people,

1754
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:12.280
none of that was able to spark the,

1755
02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:16.560
was able to spark the adrenaline as much as some kind of,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1756
02:00:16.570 --> 02:00:21.570
tap into the emotional portion of your mind to bring out just enough rage to get

1757
02:00:22.541 --> 02:00:25.150
out there and get that job done once and for all.

1758
02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:28.450
<v 3>Yeah.
And yeah,
and that's really the key there.
Just enough rage,</v>

1759
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:32.480
especially when you're talking about,
um,
something that requires technique.

1760
02:00:32.481 --> 02:00:36.910
When you say lifting your,
you're like power clean for example.
And um,

1761
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:39.530
I remember it was in,

1762
02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:42.620
in college and I was going from my one rep Max and yeah,

1763
02:00:42.621 --> 02:00:46.580
you feel a couple of times,
but for the sake of saving time and stuff,
you can,

1764
02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:49.100
they only give you three times won't in my case.
Then they were like,

1765
02:00:49.101 --> 02:00:53.690
you have to get it three times.
Um,
so the first time I had gotten all of them,

1766
02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:58.370
I was pretty solid at Parkland liens at that time.
So I was getting all of them.

1767
02:00:58.490 --> 02:01:02.750
And then I got to that point,
um,
and I didn't get it.

1768
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:07.450
It was 300 it 300.
I weighed one 85 at the time,
uh,
to 98.

1769
02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:12.590
Are you looking for props right there?
Yeah.
We'll give you props,
props,
tech.

1770
02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:16.050
Maybe when he was talking earlier about when you name drop and stuff.
Yeah.

1771
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:18.620
That's what it,
I did.
No,
I did that on purpose.

1772
02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:20.380
I did that on purpose because if I were,

1773
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:24.080
if I were to go out of my way to leave out that number.
True,
true.
You know,

1774
02:01:24.081 --> 02:01:26.300
you wanted to know,
you wanted to know how much I was doing.

1775
02:01:26.450 --> 02:01:30.500
I knew you're going to say it.
It didn't matter if you want it to hell anyway,

1776
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:35.660
it doesn't matter.
Nonetheless,
the first time I failed and everyone's like,

1777
02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:40.610
no,
you got this,
you got this.
And I had this getting rotten wood whose name?
Uh,

1778
02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:43.310
pro blonde hair,
like use,
like he's,

1779
02:01:43.311 --> 02:01:46.690
this tough guy could hit real hard and he would always get nuts and he'd be
like,

1780
02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:50.780
you got tissue,
didn't you know,
you're this and that,
you know,

1781
02:01:50.781 --> 02:01:54.350
making me mad or whatever.
And I didn't outwardly express any kind of anger,

1782
02:01:54.351 --> 02:01:58.130
but I felt that anger and power plane takes technique.
That's the thing.

1783
02:01:58.131 --> 02:02:00.440
It's not like,
it's just um,
you know,
like,

1784
02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:04.060
I dunno like even bench has some technique but is,

1785
02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:07.170
I mean everything has technique,
but right.

1786
02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:11.710
Power clean takes a little bit more technique than other lefts.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1787
02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:16.850
So it was just the perfect amount of rage,

1788
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:18.830
you know,
and that's going to depend on what kind of person you are.

1789
02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:21.590
Like Jeremy Stevens and you could tell just even the way he trains,

1790
02:02:21.591 --> 02:02:26.240
he uses some rage in there,
you know,
as opposed to Eh,
Rory Mcdonald for example.

1791
02:02:26.241 --> 02:02:28.610
Seemingly.
I Dunno,
I don't watch them train all the time or nothing,

1792
02:02:28.611 --> 02:02:31.330
but it seems like he's super methodical,
you know,

1793
02:02:31.331 --> 02:02:35.570
in rage or anger or whatever isn't used as much of a part as someone like Jay.

1794
02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:39.220
Um,
Jeremy Season fight with,
uh,
with uh,

1795
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:46.060
Robbie Lawler.
Yeah.
Homes like crazy.
We're all bored of just,

1796
02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:49.540
yeah,
man.
Yeah.
Marie's nuts,
man.

1797
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:52.670
He's the way they train up there at tri stories.

1798
02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:57.530
I spent like the the weekend or it was like half a week or whatever with them

1799
02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.270
with frozen and Rory and its heat.
Fry's has this head,

1800
02:03:03.110 --> 02:03:05.630
you know how guys will hold mitts.
I'm sure they hold mitts and stuff,

1801
02:03:05.631 --> 02:03:09.810
but he has this head that you hit the head instead of the myth.
I was like,

1802
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:14.270
well it seems like,
oh that's not that.
Like it seems kind of obvious.

1803
02:03:14.271 --> 02:03:17.900
So I never seen no one do that and it made way more sense because I've hit mits

1804
02:03:17.901 --> 02:03:21.380
before and then when you go to sparks like it,
it's kind of weird.

1805
02:03:21.381 --> 02:03:24.890
You got to get used to the difference between hitting mitts and hitting

1806
02:03:24.891 --> 02:03:28.780
someone's head.
So I thought,
man,
that's clever man.
These guys are good.

1807
02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:31.880
They're smart up here in Canada.
Yeah,
respect to those guys.
I mean,

1808
02:03:31.881 --> 02:03:35.030
I respect all the guys that get into that get in the UFC and fight,
man.

1809
02:03:35.031 --> 02:03:37.590
It's awesome to watch.
And that,

1810
02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.740
that Lawler a Mcdonald's fight was just,
was just insane.

1811
02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.090
It was insane.
You know,

1812
02:03:45.091 --> 02:03:47.380
she'd watch that fight if you haven't met anyone that hasn't watched that fight,

1813
02:03:47.381 --> 02:03:50.500
could watch that fight for him to see a couple of warriors.
Just bringing the,

1814
02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:54.140
bringing it all and leaving it all right there in the cage.
Go Watch that fight.

1815
02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:59.030
Uh,
so did you get the power clean?
I got the parking.
Yes.
Yes.

1816
02:03:59.031 --> 02:04:03.530
And then here's the thing about that power clean.
So you I,
yeah,

1817
02:04:03.531 --> 02:04:06.750
I got it right.
And so you go up and he's like,
hey,
you got to,

1818
02:04:06.751 --> 02:04:07.610
you go up in weight.

1819
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:11.720
The next one was like three o' three like super small weights,
you know,

1820
02:04:11.721 --> 02:04:13.190
cause you want to get it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1821
02:04:13.191 --> 02:04:15.740
Just so you can get the three Oh three not even close.

1822
02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:19.280
Everything was spent on that.
Is that one didn't we?

1823
02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:23.930
It was at the all time life life.
I just disengage.

1824
02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:28.130
That's all that was just disengaged and I see where it's at.

1825
02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:34.010
I'm good with that.
All right.
I feel like we should go on to the next question.

1826
02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:36.890
I think we got time for about one more,
wouldn't they?
I think so.

1827
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:38.600
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1828
02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:43.600
Jocko is the ability to switch on and off a personal feature or is it a trained

1829
02:04:47.071 --> 02:04:47.904
skill?

1830
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:52.850
Is this confused with the term beast mode?

1831
02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:58.070
What causes that switch to flip

1832
02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:03.960
the overdrive,
the beast mode,

1833
02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:08.430
the full on destroyer

1834
02:05:10.290 --> 02:05:13.950
that will not stop.
I think it's actually is,

1835
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:17.730
it is something that's learned,
I think,
and I think it's a hard lesson.

1836
02:05:17.731 --> 02:05:19.470
I don't think everyone gets it.

1837
02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:22.950
I think some people go through life without ever getting it.

1838
02:05:23.710 --> 02:05:24.230
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1839
02:05:24.230 --> 02:05:29.090
<v 5>and I'll tell ya,
it's 18 important lesson nature.
It's critical lesson</v>

1840
02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:35.870
each.
The thing that allows you to go the extra distance to dig just a little bit

1841
02:05:35.871 --> 02:05:36.704
deeper,

1842
02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:39.493
<v 1>push</v>

1843
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:42.370
<v 5>a little harder,
get after it.</v>

1844
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:45.403
<v 1>And</v>

1845
02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:51.500
<v 5>like many other things in life,
there's a dichotomy because it actually takes,</v>

1846
02:05:51.501 --> 02:05:52.790
in my opinion,

1847
02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:58.160
two opposing forces to bring it to life.

1848
02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:02.950
It takes both emotion and logic.

1849
02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:04.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1850
02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:09.690
<v 5>For you to reach your match maximum potential to,</v>

1851
02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:14.940
to really give everything you have and go beyond your limits.

1852
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.580
Because both emotion and logic,

1853
02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:20.660
they're going to reach their limitations.

1854
02:06:22.890 --> 02:06:26.920
And when one fails,
iin rely on the other one.

1855
02:06:30.190 --> 02:06:31.023
<v 1>So</v>

1856
02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:35.360
<v 5>when it doesn't make sense,
logical sense to go on,</v>

1857
02:06:36.590 --> 02:06:39.860
that's when you got to use your emotion.
That's when you got to use that anger,

1858
02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:40.731
that frustration,

1859
02:06:40.731 --> 02:06:45.731
that fear to push yourself harder to push yourself to say,

1860
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:51.080
I don't stop.

1861
02:06:54.210 --> 02:06:57.240
And when your feelings are screaming that you've had enough,

1862
02:06:57.420 --> 02:06:59.640
and when you think you're going to break emotionally,

1863
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:05.360
you got to override that emotion with the concrete logic and willpower that

1864
02:07:07.471 --> 02:07:08.820
says,
you know what?

1865
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:10.783
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1866
02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:12.900
<v 5>I don't stop.</v>

1867
02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:16.530
So you,

1868
02:07:16.530 --> 02:07:21.530
you fight the week emotions with the power of logic and you fight the weakness

1869
02:07:23.941 --> 02:07:26.190
of logic with the power of emotions

1870
02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:30.310
and in the balance of those two.

1871
02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.493
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1872
02:07:33.610 --> 02:07:38.560
<v 5>That's where you find the strength and the tenacity and the,</v>

1873
