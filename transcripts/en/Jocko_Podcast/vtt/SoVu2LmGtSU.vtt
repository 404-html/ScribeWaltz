1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.050
I get a lot of really a great emails.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.370
I will get a lot of great

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.850
messages through social media,
letters,
written letters,

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.700
I get all those kinds of things and I appreciate them all.

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.260
I don't always respond to all of them because there's I,

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.720
I physically cannot do it.
Yeah.
And of course,
you know,
oh,

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.660
get someone to manage your social media or whatever.
I'm not doing that.

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.680
If you hear back from me,
you hear it from me,

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.710
not from somebody that I paid $10 an hour to respond to my stuff and say,

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.010
cool,
get after it.
Like,
no,
I'm not doing that.
But

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.640
you know,
I get,
I would get all these things and I,
I do read them,

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.870
so if you send it,
I read it.
And so I appreciate the feedback and everything.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.260
I got one though that I,
that was good.

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.320
I wanted to actually wanting to read on here because I felt that it not only

15
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.940
said,
hey,
thanks for,
you know,
the podcast or whatever,
thanks for the books,

16
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:00.480
whatever.

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.130
It actually gave some pretty good methodology and really an inset into a mindset

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.940
that I think will help people doing what they're doing.

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.410
So here we go.
Mr Willick just wanted to share a quick story with you.

20
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.280
At 39 I'd fallen into a 15 year Rut of undisciplined alcoholism.

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.950
I was soft and heavy and wanted a change earlier this year.

22
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.040
I had started working out three to four times a week in my basement.

23
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.120
I was trying and failing to get a handle on my alcohol abuse.

24
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.200
Every failure made the beast seem bigger and unbeatable.

25
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.290
It was like I didn't have control over my body.

26
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.860
I finished your book on a Monday night and decided that I would get up early the

27
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.693
next morning and workout.

28
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.400
<v 0>I got up and worked out not much,
but I just wanted to do something.</v>

30
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.300
Sit ups,
pushups,
15 minutes on the bike,

31
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.240
worked out twice Tuesday,

32
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.690
got up Wednesday and did it again.

33
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.730
Got To Thursday night or normal drinking night and decided to try not drinking.

34
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.160
Made it through Friday.
Same thing.

35
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.180
Worked out morning and night,
stayed busy and stayed away from the drink

36
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.580
fault.
I should try and push it through the weekend.
Worked out Saturday morning,

37
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640
took the rest of the weekend,
often stayed dry.

38
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.310
Monday morning I got up and started two days again.

39
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.063
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.350
<v 0>Made it through the week with 11 workouts.</v>

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.930
By the second week,
I felt better than I had in my entire life.

42
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.220
I was astounded that normal people walked around feeling this good.

43
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.390
I guess not systematically poisoning your body will do that.

44
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.001
<v 0>On the fifth week,</v>

46
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:59.380
I got a project at work that was going to require traveling for the next eight

47
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:00.214
weeks.

48
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.930
I was worried about overcoming my triggers and road habits,

49
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.900
but normal traveling evening was dinner,
watch cable and drink eight beers.

50
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.130
To my surprise,
the hotel at a sweet gym.
Cool.

51
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.990
I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.
Then at the site I found out that weren't,

52
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.350
we would start work at 6:00 AM.
Damn.

53
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:26.880
That means I have to get up at four to work out.

54
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.060
I'm 12 weeks into my traveling.
Two a days,

55
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.300
usually getting 11 to 12 workouts a week.

56
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.370
They recently moved our start time to 7:00 AM so now I get an hour and a half in

57
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.180
the morning and evening.
I'm 16 weeks clean,

58
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.980
dropped 30 pounds or more.
I haven't been on a scale in three weeks.

59
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.010
34 waist jeans hanging off of me.
I sit up and push.

60
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.010
Upsets went from 10 to 40 to 50 kettlebell swings went from 35 by 10 to 50 by 15

61
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.280
I started to learn how to run as,
I haven't done it in 20 years.

62
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.480
Now after a day off,
I can do two miles without stopping.

63
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.120
I do four to five miles on the treadmill and nine miles on the bike besides the

64
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:23.530
sit ups,
pushups,
kettle bells,
core and weights.

65
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.090
I look forward to next year's competitive shooting season.

66
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.360
I'm going to bring it at this point,

67
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:35.500
my cravings are gone and I actually recoil from the smell of booze.

68
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.670
When I started this,
I thought it would be temporary.

69
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.730
Now what's going to be permanent?
No reason to waste time with it anymore.

70
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.150
Now when I questioned something,
your voice comes to me with the hard answer.

71
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.870
It's only black and white with no gray area.

72
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.120
One day when I'm standing before the Lord,
Lord and hear his voice,

73
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.880
if it doesn't sound like yours,
I might be disappointed.

74
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.440
The book I read those months ago was the way of the warrior kid.

75
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.280
I'm working on extreme ownership now.

76
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.460
Thank you for your service.

77
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.700
Thank you for producing a bad ass podcast and thank you for influencing my life.

78
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.350
So
there you go.

79
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.250
And I say this to people all the time.

80
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.670
Most important here is it isn't me,

81
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.493
it's you.

82
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.050
And sure you may have grabbed some little foot hold from the podcast or from one

83
00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:56.160
of the books,
but it isn't me.
That changes you.
It's you.

84
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.420
You set the small goals,
you achieve those goals,

85
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.770
then set some more and achieve those and set some more goals.

86
00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:10.200
Maybe a little bit bigger but not that much bigger.

87
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.300
You pay attention to the progress.
This guy is 16 weeks deep.

88
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:18.750
<v 1>Okay?</v>

89
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.550
<v 0>30 pounds lighter,
working harder,
stronger,
faster,</v>

90
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.590
more efficient,
competitive.

91
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.690
The individual that wrote that is getting after it and changing his life and you

92
00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:39.800
can't too,
just start,

93
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.030
start small.

94
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.680
Start with changing tomorrow morning.
Just tomorrow morning.

95
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.850
Get that squared away.

96
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

97
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.300
<v 0>And then move on to the next day and the next,</v>

98
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.980
and move your life to a better place.
One little step.

99
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.650
One little victory at a time.
