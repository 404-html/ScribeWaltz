00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.630
This is Jocko podcast number 43 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.643
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.110
All the lads have gone out to play at being soldiers far away.

4
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.560
They won't be back for many a day then.

5
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:22.660
Some won't be back any morning.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.820
All the lassies who laughing,

7
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:30.450
we're when hearts were light and lads were here.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.950
They go sad.

9
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:36.951
I'd wandering hither and there they pray and watch for the morning.

10
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.510
Every house has its vacant bed every night when sounds are dead.

11
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:50.631
Some woman yearns for the pillowed head of Him who marched out in the morning of

12
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.800
all the lads who've gone out to play,

13
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.780
there's some will return and some who will stay.

14
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.620
There's some,
we'll be back most any day,

15
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.270
but some won't wake up in the morning.

16
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.070
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

17
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.480
That poem right there is called the lads away and it's from a book called the

18
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:28.321
glory of the trenches at Coningsby Dawson.

19
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.880
It actually got this book and original copy of this book

20
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.920
from a trooper from Jesse trooper up from Canada.
And he sent me this book.

21
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:43.020
And like I said,
it's the actual first printing,

22
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.110
beautiful copy and it has that smell,

23
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.550
that old book,
a musty smell.

24
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:55.551
It's one of those books where you can actually smell the age and you can smell

25
00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:00.350
the lessons learned and you can smell the wisdom inside of it.
And

26
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.580
it's a different view.
It's a different feel.

27
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.050
And I found it to be very fascinating.

28
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.280
And the,

29
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.020
the intro to the book was actually written by Dawson's father.

30
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.850
So the,
so the intro of the book,

31
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:21.620
you know Dawson is the guy that wrote the book Coningsby.
Dot.

32
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.290
Dawson is the guy that wrote the book.
Well,

33
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:28.291
his dad wrote the intro to the book and he kind of kicks it off.

34
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:30.580
And here's some of the highlights of that.
He says,

35
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.560
I've already stated the conditions under which this book of my sons was
produced.

36
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.430
He was wounded in the end of June,

37
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.130
1917 in the fear struggle before lens.

38
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.710
He was at once removed to a base hospital.

39
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:47.500
And later to a military hospital in London.

40
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:51.970
There was in grave danger of amputation of the right arm,

41
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.140
but this was happily avoided as soon as he could use his hand.

42
00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.530
He was commandeered by the Lord High Commissioner of Canada,

43
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.540
right and important paper detailing the history of the Canadian Forces in France

44
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:04.900
and Flanders.

45
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.580
<v 2>Okay,</v>

46
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.420
<v 0>and he goes on to talk about how they came up with the name of the book and they</v>

47
00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:13.990
go through a different couple different titles and they they settle on this,

48
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.440
this title,
the glory of the change trenches.
Lastly,

49
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.140
we decided on the glory of the trenches

50
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.400
as the most expressive of his aim.
He felt that a great deal,

51
00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:29.660
too much had been said about the squalor,
filth,
discomfort,

52
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.620
and suffering of the trenches.
Now,
clearly that stuff that I've talked about,

53
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.960
and so this should or tell you,
that's what I'm talking about.

54
00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:40.460
This is a different take on world war one because he's saying,
look,

55
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.650
we've heard enough about the squalor,
the filth,
that discomfort.

56
00:03:42.651 --> 00:03:44.540
I'm going to talk about the glory of the trenches.

57
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.650
He pointed out that a very poppy little war book,

58
00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:52.850
which we were reading had six paragraphs in the first 60 pages,

59
00:03:52.851 --> 00:03:54.630
which describe an unpleasant detailed.

60
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:59.631
The vermin is condition of the men as if there were this were the chief thing to

61
00:03:59.691 --> 00:04:02.690
be remarked concerning them.
He held bet.

62
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:05.980
It was a mistake for a writer to lay too much on the streets,

63
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.610
too much stress on the horrors of war.
The effect was bad.

64
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.930
Physiologically.
It frightened the parents of soldiers.

65
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.260
It was equally bad for the enlisted man himself for creating a false impression

66
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:23.900
in his mind.
We all knew that war was horrible,
but as a rule,

67
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.990
the soldier thought little of his feature in this lot.

68
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.300
<v 2>Okay.</v>

69
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.600
<v 0>The real soldiers thoughts were concerned with other things.</v>

70
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.250
He was engaged in spiritual acts and this is what I'm talking about.

71
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:38.450
This is a different cut.

72
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.250
He was accomplishing spiritual purposes.

73
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.820
As truly as the Margaret of faith and religion.

74
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.380
He was moved by spiritual input impulses,
the,

75
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.160
the evocation of duty,
the loyal dependence of comradeship,

76
00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:57.140
the spirit of sacrifice,

77
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.180
look complete surrender of the body to the will of the soul.

78
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.200
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.430
<v 0>This was the side of war,
which men needed most to recognize.
They needed it,</v>

80
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:09.680
not only because it was the true side,

81
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.020
but because nothing else could kindle and sustain the enduring flame of heroism

82
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.420
in men's hearts.
So he's looking at this,

83
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.340
it's called the glory of the trenches in this what happens in the trenches.

84
00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:25.970
He's like a,
he's like a religion is like a spiritual thing.

85
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.690
Which another thing that drew me to this,
cause you know,

86
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:33.710
I talk all the time about how there's the most beautiful things in war.

87
00:05:33.711 --> 00:05:35.330
I mean there's not wall,
most horrible things,

88
00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:36.740
but there's also these beautiful things.

89
00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:40.240
And so I can see he's very focused on what those things are.
Hmm.

90
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.600
While some aired and exhibiting nothing but the brutalities of war,

91
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.480
others aired by sentimental Ising war.

92
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.030
He admitted that it was perfectly possible to paint a portrait of a soldier with

93
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:59.660
an aura of a saint,
but it would not be a representative portrait.

94
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.820
It would be eclectic,

95
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.750
the result of selection and elimination.

96
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.580
So he's saying like on the one hand you get these books that paint this crazy,

97
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:12.320
brutal side of war.
The other side,

98
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.950
you get them painting soldiers as saints and neither one is true,

99
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.470
which I will totally agree with.
You know,
we,

100
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.120
we do have a definite tendency to do that in literature or people that write

101
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:24.490
about war,
they want to write about,
you know,

102
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.820
they make everyone look like the best guy ever.
None of us are.
None of us are.

103
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.370
We all have faults.

104
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.793
<v 0>Back to the book,</v>

106
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.250
the ordinary soldiers and intensely human creature with an endearing blend of

107
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:40.940
faults and virtues.

108
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.770
The romantic method of portraying him not only misrepresented him,

109
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:50.771
but its result is far less impressive than a portrait painted in the firm lines

110
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:52.304
of reality.

111
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.030
So they do all this to make the guy look like a saint,
but the,

112
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.250
what's real is actually more amazing.

113
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.530
There's an austere grand juror in the reality of what he is and does,

114
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:10.531
which needs no fine gilding from the sentimentalist to depict him as Sir Galahad

115
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:17.581
and holy armor is a serious offense as to exhibit him as a Kaliban,

116
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.620
which is,
it's from,
it's from Shakespeare from the temp to see.
He's like the,

117
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.180
the ultimate bad guy in the Shakespeare's play,
the temp,
the tempest.

118
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.520
It's a total beast.
Um,
so you can't portray the person has Galahad.
You can't,

119
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.000
you can't,
you know,
again,
portray him as a saint.

120
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.790
<v 1>Okay?</v>

121
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.710
<v 0>Each method fails of truth and all that.
The soldier needs to be known about him,</v>

122
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.470
that men should honor him,
is the truth.

123
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.383
<v 1>Okay?</v>

124
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.880
<v 0>War,
a hot new air,</v>

125
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.860
which men breathed,
produced new energies and forms of thought.

126
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.580
Men were rediscovering themselves,
their own forgotten nobilities.

127
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600
The Leighton nobilities in all men bound together in the daily obedience of self

128
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:14.681
surrender urged by conditions of their tasks to regard duty as an inexhaustible

129
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.610
confronted by the pedal.
This destruction of the body.

130
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.120
They were forced into recognition of the spiritual values of life.

131
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.420
So faced with what they were facing,
a World War One,

132
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:30.900
and we've talked about that over and over again,

133
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.100
you're facing death and these guys,

134
00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:36.270
these soldiers are,

135
00:08:36.271 --> 00:08:41.271
are forced to look at their spiritual self in the common conventional use of the

136
00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:46.800
term.
These men were not religious.

137
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.170
There was much in their speech and in their conduct,

138
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:53.430
which would outrage this standards of narrow pirates ism.

139
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.670
So,
Hey,
these guys,
not goody two shoes.

140
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.900
Traditional creeds and forms of faith had scant authority for them.

141
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:01.870
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

142
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.660
<v 0>but they had made their own a sure.</v>

143
00:09:04.661 --> 00:09:07.390
Faith then lives in creeds.

144
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.240
So what they discover on the battlefield is even stronger than [inaudible].

145
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

146
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.870
<v 0>Didn't what the Dean,
what the churches say.</v>

147
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.490
It was an,
it was expressed not in words,
but acts.

148
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.390
They had fried their souls from the tyrannies of time and the fear of death.

149
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:40.250
They had accomplished in deed that very emancipation of the soul,

150
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:48.040
which is the essential doctrine of all religions,

151
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.860
which all religions urge on men,

152
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.130
but which few men really achieve.

153
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.610
However earnestly they profess forms of pious faith.

154
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.080
That's pretty amazing.

155
00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:07.081
It's a pretty amazing viewpoint that what you find out on the battlefield is

156
00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:10.990
spiritually,
spiritually stronger.

157
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.330
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

158
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.970
<v 0>Didn't what you find in the church.</v>

159
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.983
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

160
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.680
<v 0>Back to the book.
This was the true glory of the trenches.</v>

161
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.040
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.020
<v 0>They were the cavalry's of a new redemption being wrought out for men by soiled</v>

163
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.010
unconscious Christ's is.
That's what the soldiers were soiled.

164
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.910
Dirty unconscious means they don't even know it.
Christ's

165
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.180
<v 2>yeah.</v>

166
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.180
<v 0>And as from that ancient cavalry with its agony of shame,</v>

167
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.750
torture,
and dereliction,
there flowed a flood of light,

168
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.570
which made a new dawn for the world.

169
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.990
So from these obscure crucifixions,

170
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.720
there would come to men,

171
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.800
a new revelation of the splendor of the human soul,

172
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.370
the true divinity that dwells in man,

173
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.930
but God made manifest in the flesh by acts of valor,

174
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.140
heroism and self sacrifice,

175
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.850
which transcend the instincts and promptings of the flesh.

176
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:19.660
<v 2>Okay.</v>

177
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.660
<v 0>And bear witness to the indestructible life of the spirit.</v>

178
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.670
That's heavy.
Yes.
That's,
that's just eight.
Like I said,

179
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:35.380
this viewpoint is,

180
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.460
I can totally understand where it's coming from and it expresses a lot of the

181
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:47.400
things that I think,
I haven't thought about it to this degree though.
You know,

182
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:48.640
calling that be basically,

183
00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:52.080
it's calling the deaths of soldiers on the battlefield crucifixions right?

184
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.900
<v 0>And that God is made manifest in the flesh that these guys,
when they say,</v>

186
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.700
make these sacrifices,
it's like a glimpse of God.

187
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.110
These acts of valor and heroism.
And it's just very powerful.

188
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.380
Now that's wraps up,
you know,
the,
the intros longer than that obviously.
Um,

189
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.300
but now we're going to go to the book itself,

190
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.560
which again is written by this soldier Dawson and it actually starts with his

191
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:22.300
training.
So,
and he was,

192
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.360
he was from England and he lived in Canada and,

193
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.560
but he ends up joining the military cause you know,
Canada was,
uh,
was uh,

194
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.790
w w w supporting and helping Britain in a war and he'd actually traveled to New

195
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.770
York.
He'd lived all over the place and,
but now he's,
he's going to boot camp

196
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.590
and we'll take it back to the book.

197
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.500
When I had been medically examined past as fit,

198
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.900
had don the uniform and commenced my training,

199
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.670
I learnt what the enduring of hardship was.

200
00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.280
No experience on active service has equaled the humiliation and severity of

201
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:05.170
those first months of soldiering.
We were sneered at clean stables,

202
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:10.030
groomed horses,
rode stripped saddles,
stripped saddle for 12 miles at the trot,

203
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.150
attended lectures,
studied till past midnight 10.

204
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.090
We're up on the first parade at six o'clock.

205
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.490
No previous civilian efficiency or prominent stood up us in any stead.

206
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.150
We started robbed of all importance.

207
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.840
I love that we started rob devolve voluntary,

208
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.220
so you know that thing you have that an ego.
Yeah,
it's gone.

209
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.320
Just to get rid of that and only gained a new importance by our power to hang on

210
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:40.000
and develop a new efficiency as soldiers.
And you've heard me say that before,

211
00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:41.350
like when I joined the military,

212
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.810
that's one of my favorite things about it and I was like a blank slate.

213
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.800
Like everything you did in your past,
all the,
all the stuff you've been through,

214
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.930
little trouble,
things you've done,
it's all gone.

215
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.550
What matters now is what you do here.

216
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.680
When men went sick,

217
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.870
they were labeled scrim Shanker's and struck off the course.

218
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.400
It was an offense.

219
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:08.050
It wasn't a fence to let your body interfere with your duty.

220
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.140
If it tried to,
you must ignore it.

221
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.510
If a man caught cold and Kingston,
what would he not catch in the trenches?

222
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.910
Very many went down under physical under the physical ordeal of the class.

223
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.280
That started,
I don't think more than a third past.

224
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.730
The lukewarm soldier and the pink tea hero who simply wanted to swank a uniform,

225
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.260
we're eventually choked off.

226
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.750
It was a test of pluck even more than of strength or intelligence.

227
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.990
The same test that a man would be subjected to all the time at the front in a

228
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:48.220
word,
it's sorted out.
The fellows who had guts,

229
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.100
<v 1>okay.</v>

230
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.160
<v 0>Guts isn't a particularly polite</v>

231
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.020
<v 2>word,
but I have come increasingly to appreciate it's splendid significance.</v>

232
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.800
The possessor of this much coveted quality is the kind of Ada who when his legs

233
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:08.750
are smitten,
we'll fight upon his stumps.

234
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.780
And I actually was,
when I read this,
I was like,
man,

235
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.010
well is there some archaic term of idiot?
Why is he using that word?

236
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:20.820
And there was none.
Like he means that's what it means is like a guy used,

237
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.940
we say this,
the seal training,
like if you're going to be stupid,

238
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:25.580
you've got to be tough.
And then that's kind of what he's saying.

239
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.790
Like these guys will go and they will not stop.

240
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.800
And that's what guts is

241
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.080
the Tommys and that's a slang word for the British soldiers whom we were going

242
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:39.080
to command would be like that.

243
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.280
If we weren't like it,
we wouldn't be any good as officers.

244
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.320
This artillery school had a violent way of sifting out a man's moral worth.

245
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:49.830
Okay.

246
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.340
<v 0>You hadn't much conceit left by the end of it.</v>

247
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.270
So what?
Uh,
I can only imagine,
you know,

248
00:15:57.271 --> 00:16:00.600
we have a very politically correct military system now and it's getting,

249
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.320
I can't imagine what the soldiers went through.

250
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.600
I mean just an unleashing these veterans on them coming out and trying to get

251
00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:11.400
them ready for war.
I bet it was brutal.

252
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.370
And it sounds like it was brutal and it sounds like it did in a very effective

253
00:16:14.371 --> 00:16:18.990
job of getting rid of the week of making your ego completely go away.

254
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.260
You know,
getting rid of any form of conceit that you had.

255
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.523
<v 2>Hm.</v>

256
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.260
<v 0>Now he continues on the book,</v>

257
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:31.520
but I'm going to move a little bit forward here to where he's moving towards the

258
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:35.630
front and we'll go back to the book.
After trudging about six miles,

259
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.660
we arrived at the camp and found that it was out of food and that all the tents

260
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:41.804
were occupied.

261
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.040
We stretched out our sleeping bags on the ground and went to bed supper lists.

262
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.140
We'd had no food all day.

263
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.280
Next morning we were told that we ought to jump on an ammunition,
Laurie,

264
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.680
if we want it to go any further on our journey.

265
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.400
Nobody seemed to want us particularly and no one could give us the least infer

266
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.350
information as to where our division was.

267
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.710
It was another lesson if that were needed of our total unimportance.

268
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.990
So these guys are looking to find where they're supposed to report to so you can

269
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:12.470
go fight in the war and people were like,
Hey,
I got no,
no time for you.

270
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.753
Go figure it out.

271
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.290
While we were waiting on the roadside in Australian brigade of artillery passed

272
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:22.340
by,
the men's faces were dreary with fatigue.

273
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.970
The gunners were dismounted and marched as in a trance.

274
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.100
The harness was muddy.
The steel rusty,

275
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.650
the horses lean and discouraged.

276
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.130
We understood that they were pulling out from an offensive in which they'd

277
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:41.570
received a bad cutting up to my overstrained imagination.

278
00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:45.110
It seemed that the men had the vision of death in their eyes.

279
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.030
Towards the evening,
the thunder of the guns had into an ominous roar.

280
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.930
We pass through villages,
disfigured by Shell.

281
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:58.800
Fire civilians became more rare and more aged.

282
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.980
Cattle disappeared utterly from the landscape.

283
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.630
Fields were furrowed with abandoned trensor's in in front of which Hong

284
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:11.460
entanglements of wire mounted orderlies splashed along Solon roads at an

285
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:13.080
inpatient trot here and there.

286
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:18.081
We came across improvise bureau of acts of infantry far away against the horizon

287
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:23.250
towards which we traveled.
Hun,
flares and rockets were going up.

288
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.570
Hopeless Stoicism,
unalterable desolation.

289
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.610
That was my first impression,

290
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.403
<v 2>okay.</v>

291
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.270
<v 0>The landscape was getting increasingly muddy.</v>

292
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.420
It became a sea of mud dispatch riders on motorbikes traveled where leave their

293
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:43.040
feet dragging to save themselves from falling.

294
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:45.470
Everything was splashed with filth and corruption.

295
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.530
One marveled that the cleanliness of the sky,

296
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.310
<v 2>okay.</v>

297
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.820
<v 0>Trees were blasted and seem to be sinking out of sight.</v>

298
00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:57.390
In this war created slew of despondency.

299
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.760
We came to a brow of a hill in the valley was something that I recognized the

300
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:06.840
last time I had seen.
It wasn't an etching in a shop window in Newark,
New Jersey.

301
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:12.000
It was a town from the midst of who's battered ruins a splinter tower,

302
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:13.770
straight sword against the sky,

303
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.790
leaning far out from the tower so that it seemed she must drop,

304
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.400
was a statue of the Virgin with the Christ in her arms.

305
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.650
It was a superstition with the French and I remembered that so long as she did

306
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:31.830
not fall,
things would go well with the allies.

307
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:37.790
As we watched a shale screamed over the gaping roofs and a column of smoke went

308
00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:41.180
up.
As we entered the streets,

309
00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:45.350
Tommy's more polluted than miners crept out from the skeletons of houses.

310
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.640
They lent listlessly against sagging doorways to watch us pass.

311
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.210
If we asked for information as to where our division was,

312
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:58.850
they shook their heads stupidly to indifferent with weariness,
to reply.

313
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.910
For the next three nights we slept by our wits and got our food by foraging.

314
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.603
<v 2>Okay,</v>

315
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.810
<v 0>so we know,
I mean,
we know this is world war one.
We know it's a night.</v>

316
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.300
We know it's an absolute nightmare.

317
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.380
It's an absolute nightmare and it,
you know what was surprising to me,

318
00:20:19.381 --> 00:20:22.560
you know this guy's an officer and he has no idea what he's doing.

319
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.950
He's just a walking around and people are so despondent from the war that they

320
00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:29.410
just don't even care.

321
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.353
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

322
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:35.060
<v 0>Back to the book,</v>

323
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.480
there was a headquarters near by WHO's battalion was in the line.

324
00:20:38.481 --> 00:20:43.040
I struck up liaison with its officers and at times went into the crowded tent,

325
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.870
which was their mass to get warm.

326
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.850
Runners would come there at all hours of day and night bringing messages from

327
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:53.230
the front.
They were usually well-spent.
Sometimes they gassed,

328
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:54.520
but they had,

329
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.020
but they all had the invincible determination to carry on.

330
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.510
After they delivered their message,

331
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.990
they would lie down in the mud and go to sleep like dogs.

332
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.500
The moment the reply was ready,
they would lurch to their feet,

333
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.970
throwing off their weariness as if it were a thing to be conquered and despised.

334
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.460
Go ahead and read that one again.
The two.

335
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.170
These guys are dog tired dates get laid down in the mud.

336
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.370
Somebody is preparing a reply for these messages and then the moment the reply

337
00:21:25.371 --> 00:21:27.950
was met it ready,
they would lurch to their feet,

338
00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.970
throwing off their weirdness as though it were a thing to be conquered and

339
00:21:31.971 --> 00:21:36.740
despised.
I appreciate now as never before.

340
00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.840
I appreciated now as never before the lesson of guts that I had been taught at

341
00:21:41.841 --> 00:21:42.674
Kingston,

342
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.890
the other side of the town,

343
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.130
the ravages of the war were far more marked all the way along the roadside where

344
00:21:53.601 --> 00:21:56.320
clumps of little crosses,
French,
English,

345
00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.350
German planted above the hurried graves of brave fellows who had fallen AAMP

346
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.730
loans.
Ambulances were picking their way,

347
00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:07.840
weirdly turning with the last night's toll of wounded.

348
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.720
We saw newly dead men and horses pulled to one side who had been caught in the

349
00:22:15.631 --> 00:22:20.631
darkness by the enemies harassing fire in places in places the country had holes

350
00:22:22.081 --> 00:22:27.081
the size of quarries where mines it exploded and shells from large caliber guns

351
00:22:27.391 --> 00:22:31.280
and detonated bed limb was raging upfront.

352
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.630
Shell's went screaming over us.

353
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.780
Seeking out victims in the back country to have been there by oneself would have

354
00:22:39.021 --> 00:22:40.080
been most disturbing.

355
00:22:40.081 --> 00:22:45.000
But the men about me seem to regard it as perfectly ordinary and normal.

356
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.260
I steadied myself by their example.

357
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.110
Hmm.
It's,
it's,

358
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.830
it's interesting because we're talking about this and it sounds like hell and

359
00:22:58.831 --> 00:23:02.210
they're not even in the front yet.
They're not on the front lines.
This is behind.

360
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.193
<v 2>Mm.</v>

361
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.230
<v 0>That's something also we were talking about today.
Like you can see these guys,</v>

362
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.690
whatever pain and suffering they're feeling,

363
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.710
they're not showing it in the end.
He knows he can't show it.

364
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.640
And that kind of bolsters them all and makes them all stronger.

365
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:22.683
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

366
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:30.030
<v 0>Back to the book about seven o'clock as we were resting the evening hate</v>

367
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.950
commenced
in those days.

368
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.540
The evening hate was a regular habit with the hun.

369
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.140
He knew our country better than we did for,

370
00:23:42.141 --> 00:23:44.810
he had retired from it every evening.

371
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.460
He used to search out all communication trenches and likely battery positions

372
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:55.160
with any quantity of shells.
So seven o'clock at night,

373
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.510
the Germans would just,

374
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.670
they knew all the positions because they had surrendered them.

375
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.540
So then they would just start dropping bombs,

376
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.150
dropping artillery on the known positions that they knew.

377
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:09.020
They knew that the charges,
what did they built them?
Horrible.

378
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.290
His idea was to rob us of our morale.

379
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.660
I wish he might've seen how Bisley,
how much,
how abysmally.

380
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:22.130
He failed to do it down our narrow valley,
like a flight of arrows.

381
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:25.880
The shells screamed and whistles where they struck the ground look like

382
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:28.370
resurrection day with the dead,

383
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:33.430
elbowing their way into daylight and forcing back the earth from their eyes.

384
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:35.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

385
00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.300
<v 0>There were actually many dead men just beneath the surface,</v>

386
00:24:39.301 --> 00:24:41.220
and as the ground was plowed up,

387
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.800
the smell of corruption became distinctly unpleasant.

388
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.200
So these guys are buried.
They're buried in whatever,

389
00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:57.640
four or five feet of dirt and the shells come in and dig them up.

390
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.313
<v 2>Okay?</v>

391
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:06.210
<v 0>Presently the shells began to go dud.
So imagine this,</v>

392
00:25:06.211 --> 00:25:07.740
you're,
you're hearing these beggars closing and then she,

393
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.190
Michelle's hit and there's,
there's no explosion.
You know what that means?

394
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.810
It means it's gas.

395
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.000
We realized that these were gas shells,

396
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.890
a thin bluish vapor spread throughout the valley and breathing became
oppressive.

397
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.800
Then like stallions kicking in the stalls.

398
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.040
The heavy guns on the ridge above us opened up.

399
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.410
So now the friendly guns start to open up.

400
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.260
It was fine to hear them stamping their defiance.

401
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.530
It made one want to get grips with his aggressors.

402
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.830
In the brief silence is one could hear our chaps laughing.

403
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:43.410
So I want you to imagine this.
This is awesome.

404
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.700
You're getting shelled,
you're getting crushed.

405
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.310
There's dead bodies coming up from the soil.
There's gas in the air.

406
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.420
And,
and here we go.
In the brief silences,

407
00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.030
one could hear our chaps laughing.

408
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.350
<v 2>Okay?</v>

409
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.260
<v 0>The danger seem to fill them with a wild excitement.</v>

410
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:07.930
Every time a shell came near them and missed,

411
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:13.290
they would taunt the unseen huns for their propor gunnery giving what they

412
00:26:14.681 --> 00:26:17.020
considered necessary corrections.

413
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.410
Five minutes more left old caulk.
If you'd only dropped 50 you'd get us.

414
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.990
So he's giving corrections to the guns.

415
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.930
These men didn't know what fear was,
or if they did,

416
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.390
they kept it to themselves.

417
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.460
And these were the chaps whom I was to order.

418
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.430
So we haven't heard too much about that.
And I,
you know,

419
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.610
Tony's Tony and they've talked about it,
you know,

420
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:48.570
being beaten gets shot at being really close calls,

421
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:52.350
situations and like everyone's laughing and it's,
it does happen.

422
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.780
World War One don't hear much about it,
but here you go.

423
00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:57.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

424
00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.860
<v 0>Unbelievable.
And that's part of the way that military that you do,</v>

425
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.710
not just military,
but any bands or you get a bad situation.
You know,

426
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.700
a little humor goes a long,
long way.
A little humor goes a long way.

427
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.400
Back to the book,
we entered a trench,
and this is,
by the way,
this is,

428
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.850
I'm obviously not reading the entire book.
I'm going to some highlights.

429
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:22.500
So there's a little bit of a skip,
you know,
uh,
time here as they,

430
00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:27.090
as a move towards more towards the front,
back to the book,
we entered a trench,

431
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.630
holes were scooped out in the side of it,

432
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.550
just large enough to shelter a manned crouching each hole contained a sleeping

433
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:39.330
soldier who looked as dead as the occupant occupant with mechanical.

434
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.150
Some of the holes had been blown in.

435
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:47.390
All you saw of the late occupant was a protruding arm or leg at best.

436
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:52.170
There was a horrid similarity between the dead and the living.

437
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:58.230
It seemed that the walls of the trenches had been built out of corpses for one,

438
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:02.880
recognize the uniforms of French and the huns.

439
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.390
So you're in the trenches,
but,
and you're protected somewhat,

440
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:11.850
but you got to dig another hole into the wall of the trench.

441
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.860
And some of those guys get buried and killed and the bodies are just,
they're

442
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:22.980
really,
I mean,
talk about hell yeah.
Hell yeah.

443
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.063
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

444
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.690
<v 0>Back to the book,
the enemy's Schilling was growing more intense,</v>

445
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:35.000
as was always the way on the soum.
So are there at the song,
the bowel whistle,

446
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:39.530
when we were bringing in our,
when we were bringing out our wounded,
a good,

447
00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:42.470
many of our trenches were directly on filleted.

448
00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:44.360
And if you don't know what that is on filleted is like,

449
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:50.090
if you can imagine a line of people and you were shooting down the line of

450
00:28:50.091 --> 00:28:54.920
people and how much more exposed you are in that situation.

451
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.810
So picture,
if I told you to shoot a tin,
uh,

452
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.490
some of these tin cans and I lined them up in a straight line perpendicular to

453
00:29:01.491 --> 00:29:04.820
you,
you'd have to aim at each individual one and you might hit it.
You might not.

454
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.550
If we put them all in a big line where they're,

455
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.110
where they're parallel to you are there,

456
00:29:09.111 --> 00:29:12.980
there they go down the same gun target line that you have.
Yeah,
you can.

457
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.900
If you hit one,
you might hit too.
You might hit three,

458
00:29:14.901 --> 00:29:16.430
you might hit all of them with one shot.

459
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:21.260
And so this is a bad situation to be in where you never want to have the enemy.

460
00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.680
So they're basically on your flank and you're lined up for them to shoot at you.

461
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.700
It's a,
it's a nightmare.

462
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.950
Shell's burst just behind the parapet when they didn't burst on it when they

463
00:29:30.951 --> 00:29:31.910
didn't burst on it.

464
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:37.750
It was about this point in my breaking in that I received a blow to the head and

465
00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:40.990
thank God for the man who invented the steel helmets.

466
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.490
He's getting hit with some shrapnel.

467
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.840
Knight came down and we found that our carriage had no lights.

468
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.600
It must've been nearing dawn when I was away,
and again,
um,

469
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.860
I skipped a little bit,
but here,
here we are obviously in a carriage.

470
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.920
It must've been nearing dawn when I was awakened by the distant thunder of guns.

471
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.190
I crouched in my corner,
cold and cramped,

472
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.910
trying to visualize the terror of it.

473
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:11.080
I asked myself whether I was afraid,

474
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.920
not of death.
I told myself,

475
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.600
but of being afraid,
yes,
most horribly,

476
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.960
he was most horribly afraid,
not of death or being wounded.

477
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.330
He was afraid of being afraid.
Yeah.

478
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.200
This first experience in no man's land did away with my last flabby fear that if

479
00:30:37.891 --> 00:30:39.960
I was afraid I would show it.

480
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.140
One is often afraid and he soldier who was searched.

481
00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:47.430
The contrary may not be a liar,
but he certainly does not speak the truth.

482
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.500
Physical fear is to deeply rooted,
to be overcome by any amount of training.

483
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.740
It remains then to train a man in spiritual pride so that when he fears,

484
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.520
nobody knows it.

485
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

486
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.000
<v 0>Cowardice is contagious.</v>

487
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.220
It has been said that no battalion is braver than it's least brave member.

488
00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:13.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

489
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.810
<v 0>Military courage therefore is a form of unselfishness.</v>

490
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.610
Courage is a form of unselfishness.

491
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.920
It is practiced that it may save the weaker men's lives and uphold their honor.

492
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.420
But worst thing you can say of a man out on the front is it he doesn't play the

493
00:31:33.421 --> 00:31:34.254
game

494
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.990
that doesn't have necessity mean he fails to do his duty.
Listen to this.

495
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.480
That doesn't mean he fails to do his duty.

496
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:49.280
What it means is that he fails to do a bit more than his duty.

497
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.273
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

498
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.600
<v 0>When a man plays the game,</v>

499
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:58.870
he does things which it requires a braver man than himself to accomplish.

500
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.430
He never knows when he's done.

501
00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.360
He acknowledges no limit to his cheerfulness and strength.

502
00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.740
Whatever his rank,

503
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:12.130
he holds his life less valuable than that of the humblest.

504
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.840
He laughs at danger,
not because he does not dread it,

505
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:23.110
but because he or learned that there are ailments more terrible and less curable

506
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.600
than death.

507
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:37.440
Ailments,
more terrible and less curable than death,

508
00:32:37.441 --> 00:32:39.390
and that ailment is cowardice.

509
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.610
Until I became a part of the war,

510
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.460
I was a doubter of the nobility and all others,

511
00:32:50.461 --> 00:32:53.280
and a skeptic as regards to myself,

512
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.330
the growth of my personal vision was complete.

513
00:32:57.331 --> 00:33:02.331
When I recognize that the capacity of heroism is latent in everybody and only

514
00:33:03.931 --> 00:33:08.450
awaits the bigness of the opportunity to call it out,

515
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.620
<v 2>different,
take</v>

516
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.310
<v 0>different take in.
And obviously,
you know,
uh,</v>

517
00:33:20.311 --> 00:33:24.120
we've talked about world war one and unless,

518
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.510
I mean obviously he's not the only person that felt this way about things.

519
00:33:27.511 --> 00:33:29.970
And if he,
if this wasn't at least a,

520
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.270
a fairly normal attitude to have,

521
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.900
there's no way that world war one could have continued on the way it did because

522
00:33:36.901 --> 00:33:41.160
people would have been saying,
no,
this is ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

523
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.930
We just lost another 80,000 casualties.
We lost another 100,000.

524
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:51.170
These are battles where tens of thousands of people or casualties in one day and

525
00:33:52.171 --> 00:33:53.040
two days.

526
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.400
So if people didn't have this kind of attitude that this was their duty,
the,

527
00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.110
they wouldn't have been able to maintain that type of,
that type of

528
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.150
<v 2>pace.
And</v>

529
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.780
<v 0>I don't even know whether to say I'm</v>

530
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:16.180
impressed by that or disgusted by it or disturbed.
I didn't aid,

531
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.790
not disgusted,
but disturbed by it,
disturbed by it,

532
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.190
and I would say all the time you,
this is the war that I,
I,

533
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.360
I would not want to fight it wouldn't want to fight it because this is the

534
00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:31.380
attitude is,
okay,

535
00:34:31.381 --> 00:34:36.381
your duty is to go get killed when we call and it doesn't matter how good I say

536
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.550
this all time.
It doesn't matter how good your tactics are.

537
00:34:38.551 --> 00:34:39.900
It doesn't matter how good of a shooter you are.

538
00:34:39.901 --> 00:34:43.440
It doesn't matter how good of a leader you are because when we say go,

539
00:34:43.441 --> 00:34:45.180
you're going to get,
your troops are going to do what we say.

540
00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:48.360
You're going to go over the top and recharge the machine guns and guys are going

541
00:34:48.361 --> 00:34:49.290
to get mowed down.

542
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.093
<v 2>Okay.</v>

543
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.820
<v 0>Now he goes into a little bit more about,</v>

544
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.030
<v 2>yeah,</v>

545
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.970
<v 0>some of the battle
back to the book.</v>

546
00:35:03.971 --> 00:35:08.800
All this April high above the shouting of the guns are larks,

547
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.700
the larks sing joyously,
the scarlet of the poppies,

548
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.230
the song of the larks,

549
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:19.380
the lamp shining on the altar are the only external signs of the unconquerable

550
00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.770
happy religion,
which lies in the hearts of our men.

551
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.990
Their religion is the religion of heroism,

552
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:34.810
which they have learned in the glory of the trenches.

553
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.750
There a line

554
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.760
<v 1>from William William Morris is earthly paradise,
which is like a long epic poem.</v>

555
00:35:42.761 --> 00:35:45.910
It's almost like a novel which used to haunt me,

556
00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:50.830
especially in the early days when I was first experiencing what war really
meant.

557
00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.300
It reads as follows of Heaven or hell,

558
00:35:55.301 --> 00:35:57.130
I have no power to sing.

559
00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:03.180
I cannot ease the burden of your fears or make quick coming death a little

560
00:36:04.601 --> 00:36:05.434
thing.

561
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:12.090
<v 0>It's the last line that makes me smile rather quietly or make quick coming death</v>

562
00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.140
a little thing.

563
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.400
I smile because the souls who wear khaki have learned to do just that.

564
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:33.870
These guys,
this fear of death that people have and this poem that says,
Hey,

565
00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:36.510
you can't make quick death quick coming death.

566
00:36:36.511 --> 00:36:39.120
You can't make that into a little thing.
It's going to be huge and ominous.

567
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.070
Guess what?
These guys are okay with it.

568
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.950
Back to the book,

569
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:51.950
how typical he is of the days before the war when the people had only pin pricks

570
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:57.891
to endure and consequently didn't exert themselves to be brave or big sacrifice,

571
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:05.330
which bankrupts one's life is always more bearable than the little inevitable

572
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:09.690
annoyances of sickness,
disappointment and dying in a bed.

573
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:11.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

574
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:16.460
<v 0>The burden of our fears has slipped from our shoulders in our attempt to do</v>

575
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:19.290
something for others.

576
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.800
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

577
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.800
<v 0>The unbelievable and long coveted miracle has happened at last to every soul who</v>

578
00:37:27.941 --> 00:37:30.490
has grasped his chance of heroism.

579
00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:36.010
Quick coming death has become a fifth rate calamity.

580
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:42.540
Think about that.
Quick coming down.
Yeah,
you're good.
Whatever.
Whatever.

581
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.510
You're no big deal to me.
You're a fifth rate calamity.

582
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:53.690
Back to the book in saying this,
I do not mean to glorify war.

583
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:59.990
War can never be anything but be sleek and damage it.

584
00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:04.550
Deep back.
It dates back to the jungle,
but there are two kinds of war.

585
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.630
There's the kind that a highway,

586
00:38:08.631 --> 00:38:13.130
men wages when he pounces from the bushes and assaults a defenseless woman.

587
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:19.510
Then there's also the kind where you wage when you go to rescue her.

588
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:26.060
The highway man can't expect to come out of that fight with a loftier morality,

589
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.470
but you can.
Our chaps never wanted to fight.

590
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.550
They hate fighting.
It's that hatred of the thing

591
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:41.320
<v 1>they are compelled to do that makes them so terrible.</v>

592
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.040
<v 0>He goes back and he's talking now about that wooden figure of Christ that he had</v>

593
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:53.041
seen the wooden Christ gaze down from them on his cross where they suffering,

594
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.950
which 2000 years ago he had shared

595
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.760
the terrible pity of his silence,

596
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:05.500
seem to be telling them that they had become one with him in their final

597
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:09.970
sacrifice.
They hadn't lived his life far from it,

598
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:15.160
but unknowingly they had died.
His death.

599
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:22.050
That's a part of the glory of the trenches that a man who has not been good can

600
00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:27.820
crucify himself and hang beside Christ in the end.

601
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.950
So you're out on the battlefield and you sacrifice your life,
you will,

602
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.400
all of your sins are gone.
You're washed away and you,

603
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.130
you hang beside Christ in the end.

604
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:55.150
God,
as we see him and do we see him?
I think so,

605
00:39:55.151 --> 00:39:56.920
but not always consciously.

606
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.210
He moves among us in the forms of our brother men,

607
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.990
we see him most evident.

608
00:40:03.991 --> 00:40:08.050
We when danger is most threatening and courage is at its highest,

609
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.990
we often don't recognize him out loud.

610
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:15.070
Our chaps don't assert that there has fellow campaigners.

611
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.030
They're too humble minded and inarticulate for that.
So he's saying,

612
00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.790
God's all around us.
I see in the guys there,

613
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:27.380
they're his campaigners,
but,
but they don't even,
they don't say that.

614
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.090
Don't say we're doing the work of God.

615
00:40:29.091 --> 00:40:32.810
They don't say we're still living like God or we're living like Jesus Christ.
No,

616
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.170
they're too humble minded and inarticulate for that.

617
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.670
They're where they are because they want to do their bit.

618
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.333
They're duty.

619
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:45.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

620
00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:49.220
<v 0>For carefully disguised.
Instinct of honor brought them.</v>

621
00:40:49.221 --> 00:40:54.221
They're doing their bit in Bible language means laying down their lives for

622
00:40:54.981 --> 00:40:55.970
their friends,

623
00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.120
doing their bit.
That covers everything.

624
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

625
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.270
<v 0>Here's an example of how God walks among us in one of our tax on the Somme,</v>

626
00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.590
all the observers up forward,
we're uncertain as to what had happened.

627
00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.550
We didn't know whether our infantry had captured that are objective failed or

628
00:41:16.551 --> 00:41:17.420
gone beyond it.

629
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:21.590
The battlefield as far as the eye could reach was a bath of mud

630
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:27.710
is extremely easy and the excitement of an offensive when all landmarks are

631
00:41:27.711 --> 00:41:32.210
blotted out for our storming parties to lose their direction.
If this happens,

632
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:36.680
a number of May result of Italian may find itself up in the air,

633
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:40.520
which means that it failed to connect with the battalions on it's left and
right.

634
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:44.060
It's flanks are then exposed to the enemy.

635
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.370
It may advance too far and start digging itself in at a point where it was

636
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:52.970
previously arranged that our artillery should place their protective wall of

637
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:53.804
fire.

638
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

639
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:59.910
<v 0>We being forward artillery advert observers are the eyes of the army.</v>

640
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:04.620
It is our business to watch for such contingencies to keep in touch with the

641
00:42:04.621 --> 00:42:08.490
situation as it progresses and to send our information back as quickly as

642
00:42:08.491 --> 00:42:09.324
possible.

643
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:10.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

644
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:15.290
<v 0>We were peering through our glasses from our point of vantage when far away in</v>

645
00:42:15.291 --> 00:42:18.770
the thickest of the battle smoke,
we saw white flag waving,

646
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.840
sending back messages.
The flag waving was repeatedly desperate.

647
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.490
It was evident that no one had replied and probable that no one had picked up

648
00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:31.580
the messages of signal who was with us,

649
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.680
read the language for us.
A company of infantry had advanced too far.

650
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.650
They,
they were,
most of them wounded,

651
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.460
very many of them dead and we're in danger of being surrounded.

652
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.870
They asked for artillery to place a curtain of fire in front of them and for

653
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:49.670
reinforcements to be sent up,

654
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:56.340
so they're in their trench there.
The artillery guys,
they're looking out,

655
00:42:56.341 --> 00:42:57.870
they see flag,
which is how they,

656
00:42:57.871 --> 00:43:00.840
one of the methodologies they had for signaling and communicating.

657
00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:03.420
You do these different signals and you could spell out words and so they're

658
00:43:03.421 --> 00:43:07.110
getting a signal back from this group that they might get surrounded.

659
00:43:07.111 --> 00:43:08.700
We need some artillery support in here.

660
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:15.640
We at once phoned the orders through to our artillery and notified the infantry

661
00:43:15.641 --> 00:43:18.280
headquarters of the,
of the division that was holding the front,

662
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.300
but it was necessary to let those chaps know that we were aware of their

663
00:43:22.301 --> 00:43:23.134
predicament.

664
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:27.520
They'd hang on if they knew that otherwise

665
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.670
without orders are signaler was getting his flags ready.
He hopped out.

666
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.320
He hopped out onto the trench.

667
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:37.680
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

668
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.660
<v 0>he hopped out of the trench and onto the parapet.
He didn't stand a 50 50 chance.</v>

669
00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:47.820
The Hun was familiar with our observation station at strafed it with persistent

670
00:43:47.821 --> 00:43:52.710
regularity.
The signaler turned to the senior officer present.

671
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.300
What shall I send them?

672
00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.150
Tell them their messages have been received and that help is coming
out.

673
00:44:00.151 --> 00:44:04.020
The chap scrambled a flag in either hand.
He was nothing but a boy.

674
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.680
He ran crouching like a rabbit to a hump of mud,

675
00:44:07.681 --> 00:44:09.630
whereas figure would show up against the sky.

676
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:13.830
Is flags commenced to waving messages received help coming?

677
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.400
They didn't see him at first.
He had to repeat the words.

678
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.140
We watched him breathlessly

679
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.650
<v 2>yeah,</v>

680
00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:25.030
<v 0>we knew what would happen at last.
It did happen.</v>

681
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.160
[inaudible] observers spotted him and flash the target back to his guns.

682
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.990
All about the mud commence to leap up and bubble.

683
00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.350
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

684
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:39.790
<v 0>he went down signaling the good word to those stranded men upfront message</v>

685
00:44:39.791 --> 00:44:43.390
received help coming.
At least they'd seen him.

686
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.610
They were signaling,
okay.

687
00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:51.980
It was at that moment that a Whiz Bang lifted him off his feet and landed him

688
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.750
all of a huddle.

689
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.393
<v 2>His bit,</v>

690
00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.700
<v 0>it was what he'd volunteered to do when he came from Canada.</v>

691
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.700
The signal,
okay.

692
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:09.330
In the battle smoke was like a testimony to his character.

693
00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.181
So like I said,

694
00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:21.890
this had to be a common attitude and it's just hard for us to understand this

695
00:45:21.891 --> 00:45:25.460
and it's hard for me that was in the military for 20 years to understand this

696
00:45:25.461 --> 00:45:28.250
attitude that you know what?
It's your time to die now,

697
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:32.240
step up and go pass this signaling back to them.
And I'm not saying that,

698
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.150
you know,
modern military guys don't take risks.

699
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:39.440
Obviously you take enormous risks and we've got taken drastic casualties,

700
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:45.410
but it is,
this is definitely a different mentality.
There's no doubt about it.

701
00:45:45.411 --> 00:45:47.890
I mean,
obviously it's a different mentality when you're losing

702
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.890
millions of men,

703
00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.710
millions of men.

704
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:02.180
Back to the book,
and this is,

705
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.990
this is fast forward a little bit to kind of just giving a little more insight

706
00:46:05.991 --> 00:46:10.250
about what their outlook was out there in France.

707
00:46:10.251 --> 00:46:15.110
We used to tell each other fairy tales of how we would spend the first year of

708
00:46:15.111 --> 00:46:16.820
life when the war was ended.

709
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:22.870
One man had a baby who had never seen another girl whom he was anxious to marry.

710
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:27.890
My dream was more prosaic,
but no less ecstatic.

711
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:33.560
It began and ended with a large white bed and a large white bath.

712
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:38.660
For the first 365 mornings after peace had been declared,

713
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:42.680
I was to be awakened by the sound of my bath.
Being filled.

714
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:48.850
Water was to be so plentiful that I could tumble off to sleep again without even

715
00:46:49.251 --> 00:46:52.850
troubling to turn off the tap in France.

716
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.440
One has to go dirty so often that the dream of always being cleaned seems as

717
00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.020
unrealizable has romance.

718
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:06.040
Our drinking water is frequently brought up to us at the risk of men's lives,

719
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:12.370
carried through the mud and petrol can strap to pack horses to use it carelessly

720
00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.490
would be like washing in men's blood.

721
00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.530
And here's another little paragraph about,
again,
giving some more insight.

722
00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:29.140
You wouldn't think that the men who would go to war to learn how to be kind,

723
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.273
but they do.

724
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:31.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

725
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.080
<v 0>There's no kinder creature in the whole wide world and the average Tommy,</v>

726
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.620
he makes a friend of any stray animal he can find.

727
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.980
He shares his last frank with a chap who isn't his pal.

728
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:47.050
He risks his life to die in.
Consequently to rescue anyone who's wounded,

729
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.960
he's gone over the top with the bomb and bay and net for the express purpose of

730
00:47:52.961 --> 00:47:54.130
doing in the Hun,

731
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:58.180
but he makes a comrade of the Fritzy he captures.

732
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.050
You'll see him coming down the battered trenches with some scarred lad of a

733
00:48:02.051 --> 00:48:04.090
German at his side.

734
00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:19.070
Now he has,
as I said in the beginning of this are we,
he gets wounded and it,

735
00:48:19.071 --> 00:48:24.071
at this point he's been wounded and now he's heading to Blighty,

736
00:48:24.381 --> 00:48:26.600
which we talked about this before on the podcast,

737
00:48:26.601 --> 00:48:29.750
but bloody was slang for going back to England.

738
00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.793
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

739
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.130
<v 0>Back to the book.
Never my never in all my fortnight's journey to blighty.</v>

740
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.430
Did I hear a word of self pity or complaining?

741
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.100
So he's going with a bunch of wounded people.
He's not hearing any complaining.

742
00:48:43.101 --> 00:48:44.000
On the contrary,

743
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:48.020
the most severely wounded men would profess themselves grateful that they had

744
00:48:48.021 --> 00:48:51.410
gotten off so lightly since the war started.

745
00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:54.200
The term lightly has become exceedingly comparative.

746
00:48:55.250 --> 00:49:00.250
I suppose a man is justified in saying he's got off lightly when what he

747
00:49:00.261 --> 00:49:01.820
expected was death.

748
00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.453
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

749
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.460
<v 0>I remember a big Highland officer who'd been shot in the knee cap.</v>

750
00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.790
He'd been operated on and the knee cap had been found to be so splintered.

751
00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:15.190
It had to be removed of this.

752
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:18.520
He was unaware for the first day as he lay in bed.

753
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.530
He kept wondering aloud how long it would be before he could rejoin his

754
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:24.364
battalion.

755
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:30.730
Perhaps he suspected his condition and was trying to find out all his heart

756
00:49:31.081 --> 00:49:34.850
seems set at once on getting back into the fighting.

757
00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.780
Next morning he plucked up the courage to ask the doctor and received the

758
00:49:41.881 --> 00:49:44.970
answer.
He had dreaded never.

759
00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.640
You won't be going back old chap.

760
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:54.290
Next time he spoke,
his voice was a bit throaty.
We'll it's stiffen.

761
00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:00.750
You've lost the knee joint.
The doctor said,
but with luck we'll save the leg.

762
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.670
Has a voice sank to a whisper?
If you do,

763
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.280
it won't be much good,
will it

764
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.160
not much said the doctor.

765
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.650
He lay for a couple hours silent,

766
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:17.500
readjusting his mind to meet the new conditions.

767
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:23.190
Then he commenced talking with cheerfulness about returning to his family.

768
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.970
The habit of courage had the habit of courage,

769
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:33.971
which grows out of the knowledge that you let your pals down by showing

770
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:34.874
cowardice.

771
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.540
So it took him a couple of hours to adjust,
said,
okay,

772
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.790
looks like I get to go back to my family.

773
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:54.750
Now we have another type of casualty here talking about men that have had major

774
00:50:56.531 --> 00:51:01.480
disfigurements to their faces
and their,

775
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.900
they would wrap.
Their whole face is up.

776
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:10.650
Back to the book.
In these days that followed,
I saw several of these masked men,

777
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:15.030
the worst cases we're not allowed to walk about.

778
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:16.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

779
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.260
<v 0>The ones I saw were in variable and variably dressed with the most scrupulous</v>

780
00:51:21.261 --> 00:51:25.430
care in the smartest uniforms.
Sam Browns,
the best.

781
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:29.120
The belt that goes over your shoulder,
polished buttons shining.

782
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:35.730
They had hope and took a pride in themselves.
A splendid sign.

783
00:51:35.731 --> 00:51:38.960
Perhaps you ask why the faces kept,

784
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.350
the face cases should be kept in France.
So they,

785
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:46.070
the guys that had major facial did a disfigurement.

786
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.750
They would stay in France.

787
00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.973
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

788
00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.361
<v 0>I was not told,</v>

789
00:51:51.361 --> 00:51:55.020
but I can guess because they dread going back to England to their girls until

790
00:51:55.021 --> 00:51:56.790
they had got rid of their disfigurements.

791
00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:59.730
So for two years through their bandages,

792
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.400
they watched the train pullout for blighty.

793
00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:07.500
While the damage which was done to them in a fragment of a second is repaired

794
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:23.320
at a base hospital.
You see something,
what you don't see at casualty stations,

795
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.090
sisters,
mothers,

796
00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:28.900
sweethearts and wives sitting beside the beds,

797
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.890
they're allowed to come over from England when their man is dying.

798
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.320
One of the wonderful things to me was to observe how these women in the hour of

799
00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:41.080
their tragedy catch this soldier spirit.

800
00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:42.500
<v 2>Okay?</v>

801
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.410
<v 0>They're very quiet,
very cheerful,
very helpful.</v>

802
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.740
While while passing through the ward,

803
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:52.040
they get to know some of the other patients and remember them,

804
00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:53.140
<v 2>okay?</v>

805
00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:57.520
<v 0>When they bring their own man flowers,
sometimes when their own man is asleep,</v>

806
00:52:57.521 --> 00:53:01.360
they slip over to other bedsides and do something kind for the solitary fellows.

807
00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:03.700
That's the army all over.

808
00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.510
Military discipline is based on unselfishness.

809
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.670
These are women who have been sent to see their men die catch from them.

810
00:53:13.671 --> 00:53:18.671
The spirit of on distressed sacrificed and enroll themselves as soldiers.

811
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:22.703
<v 2>Okay?</v>

812
00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:28.370
<v 0>You discover the spirit of man when you've heard him wandering in delirium,</v>

813
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:35.550
so he's talking a little bit about the obviously guys that are suffering from

814
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:39.300
shell shock is what they call it,
what they used to call it in world war one.

815
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:44.780
Guys that are having some mental issues all night in the shadow reward with it's

816
00:53:45.841 --> 00:53:49.470
occluded lamps.
Q would be giving orders for the comfort of his men.

817
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.250
Sometimes he'd be proposing to go forward himself to a place where a company was

818
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:57.960
having good hot time.
Apparently one of his officers was trying to dissuade him.

819
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.590
Danger be damned.
He'd exclaim in a wonderfully strong voice.

820
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:06.480
It'll buck them up to see me.
Splendid Japs,
splendid chaps

821
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:13.141
for the soldier.

822
00:54:13.141 --> 00:54:17.880
It seems that the war has always been and that they will never cease to being

823
00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:21.150
soldiers for them both the fast,

824
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.960
the past and the future are utterly obliterated.

825
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:31.770
They would not have it otherwise because they are doing their duty.

826
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:33.370
They are contented.

827
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:34.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

828
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.620
<v 0>The only time the subject is ever touched on,</v>

829
00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:41.670
he's when someone expresses the hope that it will last long enough for them to

830
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:43.920
recover from his wounds can get back to the line.

831
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.790
That usually starts another man who will never be any good,

832
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:52.330
never be any more good for the trenches,

833
00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.970
wondering whether he can get into the flying corps.

834
00:54:56.810 --> 00:55:00.980
But one ultimate hope of all these shattered rex who are being hurried to

835
00:55:00.981 --> 00:55:05.981
blighty they have dreamt of is that they may see service again.

836
00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:14.560
And we still hear that.
We still hear that to this day.

837
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:18.160
We still hear that.
And I heard that,
you know,
I,

838
00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.790
I talked about hearing that from Ryan job who was blind and he's back in

839
00:55:21.791 --> 00:55:23.770
American.
He's like,
let me come back.

840
00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:30.380
My first guy that I ever had would get wounded bad and,

841
00:55:30.381 --> 00:55:32.050
and I,
I went to see him in the,

842
00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:37.080
in the medical outstation and I just went down to like shake his hand and he was

843
00:55:38.381 --> 00:55:40.030
on morphine,
you know,
he'd been shot in the leg.

844
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.860
He's didn't know if he's going to lose his leg or not.

845
00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.270
And like I went down and gave,
you know,
I,

846
00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:49.330
I like went to shake his hand and he pulled me in and he's like,

847
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:53.680
let me stay.
And I was just like,
you man.

848
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:58.540
What an awesome brother right there.
So this is not rare.
This still happens.

849
00:55:58.541 --> 00:56:00.600
And you know,
you hear this all the time and you know what we,

850
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:05.530
there's guys in the u s military that,
oh,
go back to combat with,

851
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.500
you know,
one leg with one hand.
Uh,

852
00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:12.250
I mean even Jody was like talking about,
you know,

853
00:56:12.251 --> 00:56:14.830
when he woke up and found Jody medical who did the podcast with,

854
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:19.330
and when he woke up and he found out that they took both of his legs,

855
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.710
he was pissed because one leg,
you can still go back deployment,

856
00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:28.630
but two bad you can't do it.
So Jody,
the bad ass,
it was just like,

857
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:32.740
no,
look.
Well,
how am I going to go back now?
Yeah.

858
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.020
Some of us will be back in the fighting and jolly glad of it.

859
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:45.250
Others are doomed to remain in the trenches for the rest of their lives.

860
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:50.050
Not the trenches of the front line where they've been strafed by the hun,

861
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:55.500
but the trenches of physical curtailment where self pity we'll launch wave after

862
00:56:55.691 --> 00:57:00.520
wave of attack against them.
It won't be easy

863
00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.530
not to get the wind up.

864
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:08.310
It'll be difficult to maintain normal cheerfulness.

865
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:09.730
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

866
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:14.260
<v 0>but they're not the men they were before they went to war out there.</v>

867
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:17.230
They've learned something there.
Game.

868
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:18.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

869
00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:21.290
<v 0>They'll remain soldiers,
whatever happens.</v>

870
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.000
So he's talking about these guys that are aren't compelled to make it back and

871
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.050
he's saying there it's going to be hard for him

872
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:34.310
but he's saying that their game when they're going to bring it,

873
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:38.150
cause there were going to remain soldiers regardless of what happens.

874
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:44.960
Now this is a pretty interesting piece where he goes back to New York or like I

875
00:57:47.761 --> 00:57:49.740
said,
he had spent some time there and he started,

876
00:57:49.741 --> 00:57:52.230
he's talking a little about about what it's like in New York.

877
00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:58.610
He says there's one person I've missed since my return to New York.

878
00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:03.920
I've caught glimpses of him disappearing around corners but he dodges.

879
00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.100
I think he's a bit of shame to meet me.

880
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.520
That person is my old civilian self.

881
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:18.870
What are full blown ego is to use to be how full of golden plans for his own

882
00:58:20.321 --> 00:58:25.090
advancement,
how terrified of failure of disease,

883
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.610
of money,
losses of death,

884
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.370
of all the temporary external,

885
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:36.140
nonessential things that have nothing to do with this spirit.

886
00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:40.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

887
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.760
<v 0>War in itself is damaged.</v>

888
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:46.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

889
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:51.430
<v 0>It's an extravagant wasteful use of resources.</v>

890
00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:56.650
A misuse of accumulated brain stuff of centuries.

891
00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

892
00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:02.480
<v 0>Nevertheless,
there's many.
A man who has no love of war,</v>

893
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:07.510
who previous to the war had cramped his soul with the littleness and was chased

894
00:59:08.331 --> 00:59:12.950
by the bayonet of duty into the blood stain,
largeness of the trenches,

895
00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:17.630
who has learned to say thank God for this whore.

896
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.130
He thinks God not because of the carnage,

897
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:31.930
but because when the wine press of new ideals was being trodden,

898
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:36.080
he was born in an age where he could do his share.

899
00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:41.880
Often at the front,

900
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:46.350
I've thought of Christ's explanation of his own on a sailor Google piece,

901
00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:52.080
an explanation given to his disciples had the last supper be of good cheer.

902
00:59:52.081 --> 00:59:53.760
I have overcome the world.

903
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.490
Overcoming the world as I understand it,

904
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:03.030
is overcoming fear.
Fear,

905
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.930
and it's final analysis is nothing but selfishness.

906
01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.170
A man who is afraid in the attack isn't thinking of his pals,

907
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.350
of his pals and how quickly terror spreads.

908
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.430
He isn't thinking of the glory which we will accrue to his regimen or division

909
01:00:19.431 --> 01:00:20.900
if the attack is a success.

910
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.800
He isn't thinking of what he can do to contribute to that success.

911
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.880
He isn't thinking of the splendor of forcing his spirit to triumph over

912
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:36.190
weariness and nerves and the abominations that the huns are chucking at him.

913
01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.460
He's merely thinking of how he can save his award,
flawless skin,

914
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:49.700
and conduct his entirely unimportant body to a place where there aren't any

915
01:00:51.601 --> 01:00:52.434
shells

916
01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:03.370
in London.
As I saw the work a day,

917
01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:06.550
unconscious nobility of the maimed and wounded,

918
01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.690
the words I have overcome the world took an added depth.

919
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.690
All of these men have,
I have overcome the world.
Look in their faces.

920
01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:22.680
It is comparatively easy for a soldier with traditions and ideals to get back

921
01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.780
to face death,

922
01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:31.781
calmly to be calm in the face of life as these chaps are,

923
01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.250
takes graver courage.

924
01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.250
What has happened to them?

925
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.630
This attitude of mind or greatness of soul,

926
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.840
whatever you like to call it was learnt in the trenches where everything outward

927
01:01:48.781 --> 01:01:50.520
is polluted and damageable

928
01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:57.120
their experience at the front has given them what in the army language is known

929
01:01:57.121 --> 01:01:58.050
as guts,

930
01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.580
guts or courage is an attitude of mind towards calamity and attitude of mind,

931
01:02:05.341 --> 01:02:10.341
which makes the honorable accomplishing of duty more permanently satisfying than

932
01:02:11.401 --> 01:02:13.650
the preservation of self.

933
01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.860
Like I said,
when I kicked this off,
this is a different,

934
01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.480
it's a powerful angle to look at these things in.

935
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.670
And I have talked about this as well and I don't know if you,

936
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:29.340
Sam Harris asked me,
hmm,
you know,
I was saying that,
hey,

937
01:02:29.341 --> 01:02:31.290
war shows you a lot of beauty in that Geez,

938
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:36.030
where you just get to see these incredible capacity of humanity.

939
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:39.540
And he said,
yeah,
you know,
you say that,

940
01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:43.170
but I've also heard you describe war as as horrible.
And you know,

941
01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:47.970
I kind of gave him an answer about,
uh,
you know,
I asked him,
I said,
hey,
if,
if,

942
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.200
have you ever known any bit survived cancer?
And he said yes.
And I'm like,
yeah.

943
01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:55.410
And when they survive it,
a lot of them say it,

944
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.450
it opened my mind,

945
01:02:57.451 --> 01:03:01.320
it freed me from being afraid and it did all these wonderful things and I'm not,

946
01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:05.370
I would never wish it on anybody,
but
they don't,

947
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:08.520
they don't wish that it didn't happen either.
They learn so much from it.

948
01:03:08.521 --> 01:03:11.580
And that's how I feel about war.
And that's kind of what,

949
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:15.990
what I read in a lot of this is Dawson saying,
look,

950
01:03:15.991 --> 01:03:19.950
you are so changed by this.
And regardless of the horrors,

951
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:25.190
the change is positive and it opens your eyes in a way that nothing else can.

952
01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:31.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

953
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.140
<v 0>Back to the book.
That's the kind of people,
God,
we got on the western front.</v>

954
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:42.000
It isn't a sad peep either.
When men die for something worthwhile,

955
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.220
death loses all its terror.

956
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:49.870
It's petering out in bed from sickness or old age.

957
01:03:49.871 --> 01:03:50.980
That's so horrifying.

958
01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:52.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

959
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:56.700
<v 0>Many a man who's cowardice is at loggerheads with his sense of duty comes to the</v>

960
01:03:56.701 --> 01:03:58.380
front as a noncombatant.

961
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:04.350
He compromises with his conscious and takes a bomb proof job in some service

962
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:08.700
whose place as well behind the lines.
So he's saying like,
okay,
a lot of guys,

963
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.100
they're like,
hey,
you know what?
I'm kind of scared.
I don't know.
I just want it,

964
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:14.610
you know,
just gimme a gimme an easy job,
you know,
I don't want to get killed

965
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:19.290
back to the book.
He doesn't stop there long.

966
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:22.380
If he's a decent search sort,

967
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.360
having learnt more than he ever guests before about the brutal things that shell

968
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:30.990
fire can do to you.
He transfers into a fighting unit.

969
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:33.383
<v 1>Why?</v>

970
01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:37.090
<v 0>Because danger doesn't appall it.</v>

971
01:04:37.091 --> 01:04:40.360
Allures he holds a challenge.

972
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.610
It stings one's pride.

973
01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:47.790
It urges one to seek out a sending scales of risk just to prove to himself he

974
01:04:49.961 --> 01:04:53.670
isn't flabby.
Yeah.

975
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:56.980
And fiber is actually another word that I looked up.
There's an old,
uh,

976
01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.860
kind of capture what the real meaning is.
And then there's the definition.

977
01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:05.250
Another definition is lacking strength or determination.

978
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:06.763
<v 1>Okay?</v>

979
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:09.140
<v 0>Now this is,
this is classic.</v>

980
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:15.760
The safe job is the only job for which there's no competition in fighting units.

981
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.520
You have to persuade

982
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.560
<v 3>men to be grooms or cooks or Batman.</v>

983
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.610
If you're seeking volunteers for a chance at a [inaudible],

984
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.410
you'll have to cast lots to avoid the offense of rejecting,

985
01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.573
<v 1>okay?</v>

986
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:38.410
<v 3>All of this is in explicable to civilians.</v>

987
01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:40.001
And again,

988
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:43.210
this is something I saw with my own two eyes and I talked about this in my

989
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:45.310
retirement speech and Ramadi,
where I was like,
okay,

990
01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:48.910
we need volunteers who wants to go over and live in this hell hole in eastern

991
01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:52.060
Ramadi and go out on operations where we're going to be taking casualties.

992
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:55.210
It's going to be a nightmare.
And I can promise you nothing but blood,
sweat,

993
01:05:55.211 --> 01:05:59.140
and tears.
Who if you want to go on that,
if you want to go there,
not,

994
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:02.350
not for one operation,
but I'm gonna put you there for six months.

995
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:04.720
So who you know,
if you want that,
put your name on the board.

996
01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:10.590
Every single guy does it.
Every single guy does it.
And that's exactly,

997
01:06:10.591 --> 01:06:14.530
that's exactly what he's talking about here.
It's exactly.
As a matter of fact,

998
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:17.140
I hooked up with this trooper down in New Zealand,

999
01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:20.800
did Jujitsu player and uh,
we were talking to you,

1000
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:22.370
he said he was in the using the room,
um,

1001
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.530
in the commandos and a Royal Marine commandos,
40 commando,

1002
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:32.130
and he was going to get moved to being a cook Frisco for your duty as a cook is

1003
01:06:34.271 --> 01:06:37.240
what he was going to get tasked with.
And he got out,
he got out of them,
read,

1004
01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.360
got out of the room rents because we know what is,
I'm going to be a cook,

1005
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.710
you know,
I'm a,
I'm a warrior.
I want to go and get after it.

1006
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:49.210
So it's like you see that did this modern day,
you know what I'm talking about,

1007
01:06:49.211 --> 01:06:50.380
how different it was back then,

1008
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:52.360
but maybe it wasn't as different as I think it is.
Yeah.

1009
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.040
Because we still got troopers that are just willing to step up all the time.

1010
01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.230
And that's,
that's one thing.
That's awesome.
You know what,
again,

1011
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:03.590
from my experience in the,
in the,
in the,
in the seal teams,
you know,
when I went,

1012
01:07:03.591 --> 01:07:06.430
when it went in,
there was no war going on.
I kind of thought that there was,

1013
01:07:06.431 --> 01:07:08.260
but there wasn't.
But these guys,

1014
01:07:08.261 --> 01:07:10.570
these kids that come in now they know where they're going.

1015
01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:13.690
They know there's a war going on.
They know they're going to get after it.

1016
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.380
And there

1017
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.270
<v 4>the lining up.
I know,
man.</v>

1018
01:07:17.271 --> 01:07:22.271
It's crazy how many people I see their reason to join is to go fight these bad

1019
01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:28.220
guys.
It's not cause I don't have anything better to do or not.
It's like Nah,

1020
01:07:28.221 --> 01:07:30.980
I want to,
I want to quit my job and go fight.

1021
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:34.190
<v 3>Yeah,
there's no doubt about it.
No doubt about it.</v>

1022
01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:41.720
Now I like this cause we start hammering on some philosophers a little bit.

1023
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:46.130
No offense to a Daryl Cooper and martyrmade cause he's big philosophy guy.

1024
01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:52.240
I know,
I know where you're at.
Cooper.
Um,
I'm going to,

1025
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:55.220
I'm going to agree with Dawson on this one.
So here we go back to the book.

1026
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:59.870
If civilian philosophers fail to explain us,
we can explain them

1027
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:05.600
in their world.
They are the center of their universe.

1028
01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.990
They look inward instead of outward,

1029
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:14.170
the sun rises and sets to minister to their particular happiness.

1030
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:16.280
If they die,

1031
01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:17.640
<v 1>okay,</v>

1032
01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.290
<v 0>the stars would vanish.</v>

1033
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:20.650
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1034
01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:25.440
<v 0>We understand.
A few months ago we too were like that.</v>

1035
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:26.893
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1036
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:32.570
<v 0>What makes us reckless of death is our intense gratitude that we have altered.</v>

1037
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:37.940
We want to prove ourselves and access how utterly changed.

1038
01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.320
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1039
01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.600
<v 0>we are from what we were</v>

1040
01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.180
in his secret heart.

1041
01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:49.440
The egoist is a self despisers.

1042
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:56.000
Can you imagine what a difference it works in a man after years of self

1043
01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:56.834
contempt,

1044
01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:01.160
at least for one brief moment to approve of himself.

1045
01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:06.840
Ever since we can remember,
we are chained to the prison house of our bodies.

1046
01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:11.430
We live to feed our bodies,
to close our bodies,
to preserve our bodies,

1047
01:09:11.431 --> 01:09:14.310
to minister to their passions.

1048
01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:21.700
Now we know that our bodies are mere flimsy shells in which our souls are

1049
01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:23.810
paramount.

1050
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:25.590
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1051
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:29.220
<v 0>We can fling them aside any minute they become ignoble.</v>

1052
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:32.490
The moment the soul has departed,
we have proof.

1053
01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.140
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1054
01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.700
<v 0>Often at zero hour,</v>

1055
01:09:35.701 --> 01:09:40.701
we have seen whole populations of cities go over the top and vanish.

1056
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:43.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1057
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:47.450
<v 0>Leaving behind their bloody rags.</v>

1058
01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:52.940
We should go mad if we did not believe in immortality.

1059
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:56.510
We know that the physical is not the essential part.

1060
01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:01.690
How better can a man shake off his flesh that at the hour when his spirit is

1061
01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:04.160
most shining,

1062
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:11.250
the exact day when he dies does not matter tomorrow or 50 years.

1063
01:10:11.621 --> 01:10:15.070
Hence the vital concern is not win.

1064
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:17.663
<v 1>But how</v>

1065
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:25.040
<v 0>the civilian philosopher considers what we've lost,</v>

1066
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.290
he forgets.

1067
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:29.470
<v 1>Okay</v>

1068
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:32.230
<v 0>that it could never have been ours for a long</v>

1069
01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:43.990
given up the self.
You know this is,
there's some zen and I'm no Buddhist monk,

1070
01:10:43.991 --> 01:10:46.240
but there's a lot of zen philosophy in there too.

1071
01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:51.130
You're completely surrendering yourself.
Yeah.
And that's a powerful,

1072
01:10:51.131 --> 01:10:54.790
powerful thing.
You look like you really liked that last part there.

1073
01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.620
It's heavy stuff.
And here's here,

1074
01:11:01.621 --> 01:11:06.360
he kind of goes down the same vein cause he's comparing civilian life and so he

1075
01:11:06.361 --> 01:11:10.230
just was talking about civilian philosophers and now he's going to go into just

1076
01:11:10.231 --> 01:11:14.040
talking about the civilian even even how

1077
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.290
<v 3>civilian spend their life.
And how he used to spend his life.
Hmm.</v>

1078
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.800
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1079
01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.820
<v 3>So here we go.
Back to the book,</v>

1080
01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:24.260
we probably caught a train and every morning the same train,

1081
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:26.690
we went to a business where we sat at a desk.

1082
01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:30.200
Neither of the business nor the desk ever altered.

1083
01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:36.190
We received the same strafing from the same employer or if we were the employer,

1084
01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.690
we administered the same strafing.

1085
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:45.650
We only did these things that we might eat bread our dreams,

1086
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:51.270
we're all selfish.
Oh,
for more clothes,

1087
01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:55.200
more respect,
more food.
Bigger houses.

1088
01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:56.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1089
01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.280
<v 3>The least part of the day we vote,</v>

1090
01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:03.660
devote to the people and the things we really cared for

1091
01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.890
and the people we loved,

1092
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:11.810
we weren't always even nice to them.

1093
01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:15.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1094
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:19.480
<v 3>Then then he breaks and he goes into what?</v>

1095
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:25.090
What it is being a soldier.
He says being a soldier is doing a man's job,

1096
01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:30.210
doing it for someone else and on afraid to meet God,

1097
01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.140
and now he's about to go in and discuss where this comes from.

1098
01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:45.670
Nevertheless,
it is true.
It isn't natural to be brave.

1099
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:51.510
How then have multitudes of men acquired this sudden knack of courage?

1100
01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:58.400
They have acquired it through discipline and training.

1101
01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.040
When you have subjected yourself to discipline,

1102
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:09.140
you ceased to think of yourself.
You are not you,

1103
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:11.630
but part of a company of men.

1104
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:16.130
If you don't do your duty,
you throw the whole machine out.

1105
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:21.110
You soon learn the hard lesson that every man's life and every man's service

1106
01:13:21.111 --> 01:13:25.110
belongs to other people
of this.

1107
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:29.550
The Organization of an army is a vivid illustration.

1108
01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:32.700
Take the infantry,
for instance,
they can't fight by themselves.

1109
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:34.950
They're dependent on the support of the artillery.

1110
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:39.870
The artillery in turn would be terribly crippled were it not for the gallantry

1111
01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:42.870
of the air service.
If the infantry collapse,

1112
01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:46.530
the guns have to go back.
If the infantry advanced,

1113
01:13:46.531 --> 01:13:47.970
the guns have to be pulled forward.

1114
01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:51.660
This close interdependence of service on service division,

1115
01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:56.130
on division battalion on battery follows right down through the army till it

1116
01:13:56.131 --> 01:14:01.131
reaches the individual so that each man feels that the day will be lost if he

1117
01:14:04.021 --> 01:14:04.854
fails.

1118
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:12.030
His imagination becomes intrigued by the immensity of the stakes for which

1119
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.090
<v 0>he plays</v>

1120
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.550
any physical calamity which may happen to himself,

1121
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:23.260
becomes trifling when compared with the disgrace.

1122
01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:27.580
He would bring upon his regimen if you are not courageous.

1123
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1124
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.800
<v 0>Now I'm about to read them a piece that's,</v>

1125
01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.480
it's just a story he tells.
It's a story within a story.
Hmm.

1126
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:44.000
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1127
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.840
<v 0>and we'll go right to it.
A few months ago I was handling,
oh,</v>

1128
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.110
I was handing over a battery position in a fairly warm place.

1129
01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:56.380
The major who came up to take over for me brought with him a subaltern and just

1130
01:14:57.051 --> 01:15:02.010
enough men to run the guns.
We're going to half an hour of their arrival.

1131
01:15:02.011 --> 01:15:06.470
A stray shell came in and caught the subaltern and five of the gun detachment.

1132
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:07.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1133
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.830
<v 0>It was plain at once that the subaltern was dying.</v>

1134
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:15.270
His name must have been written on the shell.
As we say in France.

1135
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:20.370
We got a stretcher and made all haste to rush him out.

1136
01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:21.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1137
01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:25.400
<v 0>To addressing station.
Just as he was leaving,</v>

1138
01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:30.320
he asked to speak with his major.
I'm sorry sir.
I didn't mean to get wounded.

1139
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:31.183
He whispered.

1140
01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:36.940
The last word he sent back from the dressing station where he died was telled a

1141
01:15:36.941 --> 01:15:38.390
major.
I didn't mean to do it.

1142
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:44.130
That's the discipline.
He didn't think of himself.

1143
01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:49.050
All he thought of was that as major would be left shorthanded

1144
01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.530
when he's about to tell another story.

1145
01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:01.380
That is,
yeah.
Well,
I'm just going to read it.

1146
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:05.520
Last spring,

1147
01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.690
the night before and attack a man was brought into battalion headquarters,

1148
01:16:09.691 --> 01:16:11.640
dug out under arrest,

1149
01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:16.690
the colonel and the adjutant.

1150
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.340
We're busy attending the last details of their preparations.

1151
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:24.250
The adjutant looked up irritably.
What is it?

1152
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1153
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:28.760
<v 0>The NCO of the guard answered.</v>

1154
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.390
We found this man sir,
in a communication trench.

1155
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.720
His company has been in the front line for two hours.

1156
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:39.800
He was sitting down with his equipment thrown away and evidently has no

1157
01:16:39.801 --> 01:16:41.900
intention of going up

1158
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:47.290
the adjutant glance coldly at the prisoner.

1159
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.060
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1160
01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:53.680
<v 0>what have you to save for yourself so you understand this.
So there's a there.</v>

1161
01:16:53.681 --> 01:16:56.500
They found the soldier,
he was,
his troops were up,

1162
01:16:56.501 --> 01:16:59.800
been fighting on the front line for two hours.
Big Find Him.

1163
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:02.770
He's got his radio strewn about and they say,

1164
01:17:02.771 --> 01:17:05.320
are you going to go fight with your man?
And he says he's not going to go.

1165
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:11.210
So the agile glance,
Colby at the prisoner,
what have you to say for yourself?

1166
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.560
The man was ghastly white and shaking like an aspen,

1167
01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.161
sir.

1168
01:17:18.161 --> 01:17:22.450
I'm not the man I was since I saw my best friend Jimmy with his head blown off

1169
01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.080
and lying in his hands.
It's kind of got me,

1170
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.350
I can't face up to it.

1171
01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:34.500
The adjutant was silent for a few seconds.

1172
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:40.050
Then he said,
you have a double choice.

1173
01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:45.980
You can either be shot up there doing your duty or behind the lines as a coward.

1174
01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:51.450
It's for you to choose.
I don't care.

1175
01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.750
The interview was ended.
He turned again to the colonel.

1176
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.140
The man slowly straightened himself,

1177
01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:06.340
saluted like a soldier and marched out alone to the front.

1178
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.910
That's what discipline does for a man who's going back on himself.

1179
01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.580
And like I said,
I'm not even,

1180
01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:28.950
I'm not even sure how I feel about that story.
I actually don't know.

1181
01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:32.490
Um,
you know,
you got a guy in Itto Hackworth talks about this.

1182
01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:33.630
Dick winters talked about this,

1183
01:18:33.631 --> 01:18:38.631
where you get guys that they're broken and you got to give him a break and you

1184
01:18:41.881 --> 01:18:45.090
know,
what has this guy been through?
God only knows,
you know,

1185
01:18:45.091 --> 01:18:46.770
obviously he saw his friend get killed.

1186
01:18:46.771 --> 01:18:48.720
I'm sure he was near death and over and over again.

1187
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.090
And the colonel just says,
nope.

1188
01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:57.630
You either get out there and die or you die back here as a coward.

1189
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:04.640
It's,
it's,
you know,
I'm,

1190
01:19:04.641 --> 01:19:09.560
I'm kind of,
there's like a part of me that is,

1191
01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:11.980
that is filled with admiration.

1192
01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:20.100
Cause the guy obviously overcomes his fears and there's also a part of me that's

1193
01:19:20.101 --> 01:19:23.700
filled with horror because he overcomes his fierce.

1194
01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:24.713
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1195
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.340
<v 0>And to give that,</v>

1196
01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:34.360
to give that final order and for the soldier to give that final salute.

1197
01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.190
It's just all of it.

1198
01:19:41.191 --> 01:19:46.191
The bravery and at the same time the callousness and at the same time the fear

1199
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:52.430
and at the same time the courage and the dedication to duty and yet its

1200
01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.230
dedication to madness.

1201
01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:01.043
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1202
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.420
<v 0>And again,
it's,</v>

1203
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:09.120
it's a window into human nature.
Hmm.

1204
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:10.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1205
01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:15.560
<v 0>And what people go through and what people will do and won't do it,</v>

1206
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.240
what it takes to get them there.

1207
01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.293
Back to the book,

1208
01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:33.650
one of the big influences that helps keep a soldier soul sanitary is what's

1209
01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:37.980
known in the British army as spit and Polish

1210
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:44.540
directly.
We pull out for rest,
we start to working burnishing and washing.

1211
01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:49.850
The chaps may have shown the most brilliant courage and self sacrificing

1212
01:20:49.851 --> 01:20:54.580
endurance.
It counts for nothing if they're untidy the first morning,

1213
01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.780
no matter what are the weather conditions,
we hold an inspection.

1214
01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.500
Every man has to show up with his chin,
shaved hair cut,

1215
01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:04.990
leather polished and buttoned shining.

1216
01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.140
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1217
01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.940
<v 0>If he doesn't,
he gets Hell</v>

1218
01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:14.950
No.
I mean clearly we've talked about this since day one.

1219
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.690
The discipline and maintaining the discipline and here these guys coming off the

1220
01:21:19.691 --> 01:21:22.690
front lines from the trenches.
Alright,
cool.

1221
01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.780
Tomorrow morning we're having inspections or get your deer together and Polish

1222
01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:26.614
your boots.

1223
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:28.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1224
01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.100
<v 0>Back to the book.
There's a lot in it.</v>

1225
01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:34.150
You bring a man out from a tight corner where he's been an hourly contact with

1226
01:21:34.151 --> 01:21:38.170
deaf.
He's apt to think what's the use and taking pride in myself.

1227
01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.140
I'm likely to be done in any day.

1228
01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.870
It'll all be the same if I'm dead,

1229
01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:48.190
but if he doesn't keep clean in his body,

1230
01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.350
he won't keep clean in his mind.

1231
01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:51.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1232
01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:56.510
<v 0>The man who has his buttons shining brightly in his leather polished is usually</v>

1233
01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:59.540
the man who is brightly polished on the inside.

1234
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.820
Spit and Polish teaches a man to come out of the trenches from seeing his pals

1235
01:22:04.821 --> 01:22:08.750
killed and carry on as though nothing abnormal had happened.

1236
01:22:09.970 --> 01:22:10.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1237
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:14.470
<v 0>It educates him in an impersonal attitude towards calamity,</v>

1238
01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.180
which makes it bearable.

1239
01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:17.910
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1240
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:21.840
<v 0>It forces him not to regard anything to tragically.</v>

1241
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:28.390
If you can stand aside from yourself and poke fun at your own tragedy and

1242
01:22:29.161 --> 01:22:33.360
tragedy always has.
It's humorous aspects that helps.

1243
01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:40.310
We were sometimes we were in the soum for several months.

1244
01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:43.010
The mud was up to our knees almost all the time.

1245
01:22:43.190 --> 01:22:47.390
We were perishingly cold and very rarely dry.
There was no natural cover.

1246
01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.130
When we went up forward to observe,

1247
01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:52.990
we would stand in water to our knees for 24 hours rather than going to the dug

1248
01:22:52.991 --> 01:22:57.260
outs.
They were so filled with vermin and batten flies,

1249
01:22:58.190 --> 01:22:59.360
wounded and straight.

1250
01:22:59.361 --> 01:23:03.290
Men often drowned on their journey back from the front line.

1251
01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.060
Many of the dead never got buried.

1252
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.480
Lives couldn't be risky in carrying it them out.

1253
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:11.950
We were so weary at the site of those who rested forever,

1254
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:15.100
only stirred in asa quiet envy.

1255
01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.300
Our emotions were too exhausted for hatred.
They usually are,

1256
01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:24.570
unless some new hunnish snus had roused them.

1257
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:25.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1258
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:30.020
<v 0>When we were having a bad time,
we'd glance across no man's land and say,</v>

1259
01:23:30.021 --> 01:23:32.500
poor old fritzy.
He's getting the worst of it.

1260
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:35.260
That thought helps,

1261
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:43.790
and this is a piece where he talks about when somebody's not holding the line,

1262
01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:44.960
when somebody is a quitter,

1263
01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:51.260
when you come to consider it a quitter is always a selfish man.

1264
01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.520
It's selfishness that makes a man a coward or dessert,

1265
01:23:55.521 --> 01:23:58.130
or if he's in a dangerous place and runs away,

1266
01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.520
all he's doing is thinking of himself.

1267
01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:06.560
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1268
01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.450
<v 0>And he goes on to say,
here,</v>

1269
01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:11.750
I've been supposed to have been talking about God as we see him.

1270
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:12.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1271
01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:15.690
<v 0>I don't know whether I have,
as a matter of fact,</v>

1272
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:17.580
if you asked me when I was out there,

1273
01:24:17.581 --> 01:24:20.610
whether there was any religion in the trenches,
I should have replied.

1274
01:24:20.611 --> 01:24:21.780
Certainly not.

1275
01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:24.633
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1276
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:27.010
<v 0>Now that I've been out of the fighting for a while,</v>

1277
01:24:27.011 --> 01:24:31.540
I see that there is religion there a religion which will dominate the world when

1278
01:24:31.541 --> 01:24:34.390
the war has ended.
The religion of heroism.

1279
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:35.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1280
01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:40.260
<v 0>It's a religion in which men don't pray much with me.</v>

1281
01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:44.970
Before I went to the front,
prayer was a habit out there.

1282
01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.350
I lost the habit.

1283
01:24:47.190 --> 01:24:50.430
What one was doing seemed sufficient.

1284
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1285
01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:55.470
<v 0>I got the feeling that I might be meeting God at any moment,</v>

1286
01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.560
so I didn't need to be worrying him all the time,

1287
01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.780
hanging on to spiritual telephone and feeling slightly slighted if he didn't

1288
01:25:03.781 --> 01:25:06.450
answer me directly when I rang him up.

1289
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:07.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1290
01:25:07.890 --> 01:25:12.110
<v 0>If God was really interested in me,
he didn't need constant reminding.</v>

1291
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:16.020
When he had a world to managed,

1292
01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:19.630
it seemed best not to interrupt him with frivolous petitions,

1293
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:22.900
but to put my prayers into my work.

1294
01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.150
That's how we all feel out there.

1295
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:34.150
I've learned discipline and my own total unimportant.

1296
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1297
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:37.840
<v 0>In the army,
discipline gets possession of your soul.</v>

1298
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:40.690
You learned to suppress yourself,

1299
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.640
to obey implicitly to think of others before yourself.

1300
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:50.790
You learn to jump at an order to forsake your own convenience at any hour of the

1301
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:55.150
day or night to go forward on the most lonely and dangerous errands without

1302
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:55.984
complaining,

1303
01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:57.710
<v 1>okay?</v>

1304
01:25:57.710 --> 01:26:02.710
<v 0>You learn to feel that there is only one thing that counts in life and only</v>

1305
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:04.790
thing you can make out of it.

1306
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.100
The spirit you have developed in encountering difficulties.

1307
01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:16.030
Your body is nothing.
It can be smashed in a minute.

1308
01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:20.140
How frail it is.
You never realize until you've seen men smashed.

1309
01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.300
So you learn to tolerate the body,

1310
01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:27.420
to despise death and to place all your alliance on courage,

1311
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:34.470
which when is found at its best is the power to endure for the sake of others.

1312
01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:47.180
<v 1>Okay?
He</v>

1313
01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.700
<v 0>closing out here.</v>

1314
01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.280
The religion of the trenches is not a religion which analyzes God with in

1315
01:26:59.951 --> 01:27:03.790
pertinent speculation.
So,
so in this religion,
in the trenches,

1316
01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:07.960
God is not standing in some kind of,
in a fourth Terrian judgment.

1317
01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:12.190
It isn't a religion which takes up much of his time.

1318
01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:18.910
It's a religion which teaches men to carry on stout be and to say,

1319
01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.500
I've tried to do my bit as best I know how

1320
01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:32.180
that's the simple religion of the trenches as I have learnt it a religion not

1321
01:27:32.791 --> 01:27:33.720
without glory.

1322
01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1323
01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:40.650
<v 0>To carry on as bravely as you know how and to trust God without worrying him.</v>

1324
01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:48.320
And the last line I'll read from the glory that trend,

1325
01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.330
Dawson says,
it's funny,

1326
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:59.790
you go away to the most damn Umble undertaking ever invented

1327
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:07.880
and you come back cleaner in spirit.

1328
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:16.950
<v 1>Yeah.
Then</v>

1329
01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:19.101
<v 0>again,</v>

1330
01:28:19.101 --> 01:28:24.101
I will tell you that from my perspective and from what I've been through,

1331
01:28:24.861 --> 01:28:25.820
which by the way,

1332
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.280
I want to say that what I've been through in my military career is absolutely

1333
01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:32.114
nothing.

1334
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:37.010
Nothing compared to what a soldier in World War One lived through.

1335
01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:41.610
But what I did go through,
I will say this,

1336
01:28:41.611 --> 01:28:46.611
I don't think war took anything away from me or impacted me in a negative way.

1337
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:55.910
I think war made me better.

1338
01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.270
I think war made me a man,
a better person.

1339
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:09.380
And in the words of Dawson,

1340
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:14.270
I think it absolutely cleaned my spirit

1341
01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:23.850
and I am.
I am thankful for that.

1342
01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:30.770
And I guess that the question becomes how can we clean our spirits without war?

1343
01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:37.250
How can we do that?
And I think the answer again,

1344
01:29:37.251 --> 01:29:40.490
and this is something that I don't mean that I think

1345
01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:42.430
<v 1>okay,</v>

1346
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:46.030
<v 0>is that it comes from discipline.
That's what I talk about it all the time.</v>

1347
01:29:46.031 --> 01:29:49.240
It's about setting aside comfort,
setting aside weakness,

1348
01:29:49.241 --> 01:29:54.241
setting aside fear in having the discipline to endure.

1349
01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:57.660
I mean door,

1350
01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.280
the challenges and the hardship and the pain in order to become better,

1351
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:11.443
to,

1352
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:16.990
to suffer the glory of the discipline

1353
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:24.490
to become stronger and faster and smarter and better

1354
01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.710
and and now from a leadership perspective

1355
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:34.590
is to then put,

1356
01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:38.790
put others before yourself

1357
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:46.100
the try and do some good in the world for others to lead them down the right

1358
01:30:47.461 --> 01:30:49.380
path.
Not,
not for you,

1359
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.313
but for them.

1360
01:30:56.810 --> 01:31:01.810
And while war certainly taught me those things and ingrained those things into

1361
01:31:04.851 --> 01:31:06.740
my mind,
if they weren't already there,

1362
01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:11.160
I don't think you need to go to a war told her no.

1363
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:20.290
But I do think that you have to discipline yourself and you have to get outside

1364
01:31:21.291 --> 01:31:25.340
your comfort zone and you have to push yourself beyond what you thought you

1365
01:31:25.341 --> 01:31:28.550
could ever do
to get

1366
01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:32.850
to get that glimpse

1367
01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.510
of the truth and to get that glimpse

1368
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.900
of the glory
in the trenches

1369
01:31:56.650 --> 01:31:57.483
heavy one.

1370
01:31:59.160 --> 01:31:59.993
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1371
01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:05.800
<v 3>And again,
thanks to Jesse for sending me this book,</v>

1372
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:11.220
outstanding old copy printed in 1918 and I actually

1373
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:17.200
typed it all out so I didn't have to mess up this beautiful book.

1374
01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.650
I learned a lot from it,
so I appreciate it.
And

1375
01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:26.193
Echo Charles

1376
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:30.520
saved me and talk.

1377
01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:38.080
Talk about something more like for instance.
Yeah,
but like for instance,

1378
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:43.320
people just listen to this and uh,
maybe they want to listen to more of it.
Sure.

1379
01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:47.560
How could they help that occur in the world?
Help move that process along?

1380
01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.600
<v 4>We could or we could just talk about Jocko white tea for like 10 minutes.</v>

1381
01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:56.980
We could definitely talk about Daca wasn't really that into Dell.
I actually,

1382
01:32:56.981 --> 01:32:59.600
I was,
I'm into tea every once in a while and I can wait.

1383
01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:04.610
You said a lot of the tea from the office is now missing,
but you know,

1384
01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:06.820
like you're like,
ah,
you know,
it's a mellow night.

1385
01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:11.230
I should just call it and go to bed or something.
Then I'd make like,

1386
01:33:11.231 --> 01:33:15.430
you know what,
what's the mellow one Kemah meal or whatever.
Yeah,

1387
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.570
I'm not into t like I said.
So I was like,
all right,
well,

1388
01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:23.750
Hey Jocko tea.
It's cool.
I'm cool.

1389
01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:27.870
How's that working out?
Don't write in.

1390
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:31.120
It was like a random Saturday and I was like,
Hey,

1391
01:33:31.121 --> 01:33:32.440
I'm going to do like how you do,

1392
01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:36.730
put it on ice and see if I can't get my refresh on,
you know,
outside of whatever.

1393
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:41.920
And um,
so I put it in,
I put in this tent,
Colorado's nice man.
I'll say,

1394
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:46.210
Ooh,
I think I might be into tea a little bit.
Sarah comes out,
she has hers too.

1395
01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:48.970
It was nice.
It was cool man.
We are going through it

1396
01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.390
<v 3>very quickly because their whole family is getting after it right now.</v>

1397
01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.730
My younger kids.
But yeah,
and you know what's awesome?

1398
01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.820
I Dunno if you've a go go on to amazon.com and read the reviews that people are

1399
01:34:03.551 --> 01:34:04.384
riding yet.

1400
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:07.330
I'm actually gonna I'm going to have to bring out some of those and read them.

1401
01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:12.460
Awesome.
They're funny as hell and they're great.

1402
01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:17.180
So everyone that's writing reviews for Jocko t Jocko white tea.
Uh,

1403
01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:21.550
appreciate it.
It's awesome and gotten a lot of good feedback as well about,

1404
01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:22.653
you know,

1405
01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:27.490
everyone likes it tastes great and it makes you feel real good.

1406
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:31.360
Heel makes you feel it's a little glory,
a little glory and a cup.

1407
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.700
Little glorying up ice tea.

1408
01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:38.670
<v 4>Oh,
looking over like the instructions.
So let me just in case he don't eat,</v>

1409
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:41.000
you don't read the instructions.
I think they're pretty straightforward.

1410
01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.600
I think if we've ever had tea,
people know.

1411
01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.900
But if you took the time to read the instructions,

1412
01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:49.450
this is what you would would read.
Brewing instructions,

1413
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.650
boil eight ounces of water,
pour water over one bag of Jocko white tea,

1414
01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:57.990
brew for three to five minutes.
Enjoy over or enjoy

1415
01:34:57.990 --> 01:35:00.890
<v 3>a hot or over ice.
Get after it.</v>

1416
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.860
So get after it is part of the instructions

1417
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.870
in what's funny is when people are,
are,
it's,
it's real.

1418
01:35:09.190 --> 01:35:11.990
Like you really like have to get after it.

1419
01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:17.900
And so that's what,
that's what's funny is people are saying it's real,
it's real,

1420
01:35:18.230 --> 01:35:22.580
it's real.
There's some real stuff in there.
And when you get it in your brain,

1421
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:25.490
you'll be like,
oh I'm going to go knock out some projects,

1422
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.330
maybe do a little metcon,
maybe go get on the mat,
whatever.
You know,

1423
01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:33.800
it's just good.
Or I might just cruise by the pool.
We don't do that.

1424
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.560
That's not getting half of it.
And that makes one of us,

1425
01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:40.690
I was getting an afternoon in the pool.
How about that?
I guess a year approved.

1426
01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.920
Approved.
No,
it's good.
And then,
um,
like I said,

1427
01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:47.680
it made me even more into t cause there's like,
you know,

1428
01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:52.310
it's like you get into,
well I did,
I'm not going to say this is what happens,

1429
01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:56.150
but I'm saying you're like,
okay,
I like this tea.
I like the brand.
You know,

1430
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:59.690
and then you appreciate the experience when,
when it goes down,
you know,

1431
01:35:59.691 --> 01:36:02.600
you're more familiar with it now.
Now I want to see people drinking tea.
I'm like,

1432
01:36:02.601 --> 01:36:06.350
yeah,
some people have been like,
well some people emailed and said,
Whoa,

1433
01:36:06.351 --> 01:36:09.770
is it really like Jocko made this too.
I'm really

1434
01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:15.110
took like it took a few months to make,
cause they kinda,
I'd send back,
oh no,

1435
01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:17.180
make it a little bit more of this,
a little bit less of that.

1436
01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:22.130
And eventually when I got the the right combination,
then it was okay.

1437
01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:26.030
And what they're like,
okay,
well for marketing,
what do you want to do?
And I go,

1438
01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:30.950
Oh,
here's the marketing.
I'm mister marketing over here.
Put it in a black box.

1439
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:34.130
Oh,
what should we call it?
Oh,
I think of a good original title.

1440
01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.750
Jocko t how's that?
Okay.
So we've got Jocko white tea.
Good.
There it is.

1441
01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:41.040
And that's my marketing strategy.

1442
01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.073
No,
I like it.

1443
01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:50.060
Go hire a marketing company to come in and do an assessment of our customers.

1444
01:36:50.061 --> 01:36:54.980
Guess what?
Our customers are out to kick ass.
They don't want all this crap.

1445
01:36:55.890 --> 01:37:00.380
They want something that's gonna make them crush the world.
And so there you go.

1446
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:04.760
We don't need to put any,
you know,
images of whatever on it.

1447
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:09.590
Doing some kind of demographic studies on what kind of interests and you know,

1448
01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.980
who's what the target market,
the target market.
I don't care.

1449
01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:16.910
I know the target market is the target market is my people out there that are

1450
01:37:16.911 --> 01:37:20.480
getting after it.
There's a target market.
Nope.
There you go.
I just hope,

1451
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:23.840
I just thought,
I hope this doesn't fall into the wrong ants.

1452
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.570
What if criminal criminally minded people or people that are um,
you know,

1453
01:37:29.571 --> 01:37:33.500
have evil thoughts.
Maybe if they start drinking white tea,
we'd be in trouble.

1454
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:38.300
We might have to bolster up and drink more white tea or they could switch over

1455
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:41.390
to the old discipline equals freedom kind of situation.
And you know,

1456
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:45.100
I'm just saying theoretically that could be something that might be good to
look.

1457
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:50.240
This is good man.
Slipped.
Looks good.
Yup.
Yup.
Good.
Yeah.

1458
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:52.310
Alright,
cool.
Jocko white tea.
Yeah.

1459
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:57.110
You can order on amazon.com after you click through,
click through.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1460
01:37:57.330 --> 01:38:00.450
Which we,
you know what,
there's a whole tail behind the click through right now.

1461
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:04.200
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's kind of,
we have to make sure,

1462
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.980
because that's one of the main ways to support the podcast is to click through.

1463
01:38:07.981 --> 01:38:12.270
But if in the past you saved,
oh,
first of all,
if you had the trooper,

1464
01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:16.350
the trooper tool is Nolan void.
We got shut down by Amazon.
It was,

1465
01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.030
let's just say they didn't really like it that much.

1466
01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:21.600
They didn't like it that much because I was,
I've been proven wrong in the world.

1467
01:38:21.601 --> 01:38:22.830
This is one of the Times I've been wrong.

1468
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:26.940
There is such a thing as getting after it too much and apparently we were

1469
01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:30.390
getting after it.
Troopers were getting after it too much with the trooper tool,

1470
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:34.090
so they shut down the trooper tool.
Okay.
So if you're still have the trip too.

1471
01:38:34.091 --> 01:38:35.420
I don't know if it still works,
but if it,

1472
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:37.230
if you still have it and you think you're using it,
you're not,

1473
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.170
you're not supporting the podcast.
Yeah.
So what you have to do,

1474
01:38:40.171 --> 01:38:45.171
and also if you have your old link saved that would click you into uh,

1475
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:49.440
Amazon and you thought,
oh,
I just use this and I'll just save the,

1476
01:38:49.441 --> 01:38:50.310
what's that called a favor.

1477
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:53.640
If you made it a favorite marvel for if you bookmarked it,

1478
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:56.090
then you got to erase that bookmark.

1479
01:38:56.130 --> 01:39:00.720
You've got to go back to Jocko podcast.com or back to Jocko store.com and you've

1480
01:39:00.721 --> 01:39:05.721
got to make a new bookmark that has the new click through to Amazon so we can

1481
01:39:05.911 --> 01:39:09.720
get Amazon back in the game supporting the podcast.
Again,

1482
01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:11.040
it's not costing you anything.

1483
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:13.830
All it's going to cost you is that short period of time to click through.

1484
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:15.420
And that way we can support the podcast.

1485
01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:18.810
That way we can buy more knives for the table

1486
01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:23.370
and that's what we're looking to do.
And Amazon is not mad at us.

1487
01:39:23.371 --> 01:39:27.030
They were just like,
Hey,
the trooper tools too heavy.
It's too heavy.

1488
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:29.760
It's like when,
uh,
what was,

1489
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:33.390
what was that book we just did where the Germans were mad that the Americans

1490
01:39:33.391 --> 01:39:36.630
weren't getting after it too much.
Yeah.
This is unethical.

1491
01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.610
Like theoretically from Amazon's perspective,
like,
like the Nazis,

1492
01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:44.590
they thought,
man,
these guys are getting after it too much,
too little.

1493
01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:48.960
This trooper tool thing is we need to rest so there's no more true to go save a

1494
01:39:48.961 --> 01:39:50.790
new bookmark.
Jibo Cibella from,

1495
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:55.260
from Dako podcast.com or from

1496
01:39:56.890 --> 01:40:00.090
the Jacka store.com.
Alright,
so that's good.
That was a man.

1497
01:40:00.091 --> 01:40:04.720
That was a really good analogy right there by the way.
The German,
the Nazis.
Yeah.

1498
01:40:04.770 --> 01:40:05.603
Was good.
I'm not trying,

1499
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:10.730
I'm not trying to say it was fascist in what Amazon did because it wasn't we,

1500
01:40:10.731 --> 01:40:12.610
you know,
they're there.
It's a great point.

1501
01:40:12.611 --> 01:40:15.540
It actually really is truly a great program.
It really is a great program.

1502
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:19.380
It's a very supportive of us and it's cool for Amazon because people are ordered

1503
01:40:19.381 --> 01:40:22.870
and stuff through Amazon.
I love buying stuff and doing it through our,

1504
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.750
our website.
It makes me feel good.

1505
01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.620
It's like another excuse to just buy more books.

1506
01:40:28.621 --> 01:40:31.470
I'm my books at a ridiculous rate right now.
It's actually,

1507
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:34.140
it's almost embarrassing how many books on buying right now.

1508
01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:36.960
Cause everybody recommends me a book and I used to say,

1509
01:40:36.961 --> 01:40:38.880
well maybe I'll take a look at it.
I don't have time to do that anymore.

1510
01:40:38.881 --> 01:40:43.870
Now I just order it.
Just bring it to me.
It's Amazon.
I want it today.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1511
01:40:44.050 --> 01:40:48.510
Is How cool is that?
Amazon prime.
Same Day delivery.

1512
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:51.990
Bring me my books.
I'm getting some,
you know what else is cool is,

1513
01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:55.630
so I was going to mark up the book,
the glory that judges,

1514
01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.750
but I didn't want to mark it up obviously because it's an old beautiful copy.

1515
01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:02.020
So I bought a new one.
Okay.
Now when you,

1516
01:41:02.021 --> 01:41:06.380
when you buy these certain books from Amazon there,

1517
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:08.980
they print them immediately.
Oh right,
right.
Yeah.

1518
01:41:08.981 --> 01:41:13.090
And so this book has got printed on the 22nd of September for me.

1519
01:41:13.091 --> 01:41:15.340
And then I had just ordered it so I could mark this one up.

1520
01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:19.960
It didn't arrive before I went on my trip,
so I did it on another coffee.

1521
01:41:19.961 --> 01:41:22.150
So anyways,
um,
yeah,
they,

1522
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:25.450
they will put a lot of these books that we're bringing out that our rare books

1523
01:41:25.451 --> 01:41:27.700
that are old books that are out of print books,
they just reprint them.

1524
01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:32.290
So you can get a book printed,
they'll bring it,
they're the ones out here on the,

1525
01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:35.980
on the west coast or printed in San Bernardino,
California.
Sam Bird Do.

1526
01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:40.090
There you go and you order it.
They drive it down that day.
Boom.
Yeah.

1527
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:44.260
I don't know what man,
I don't know how this awesome something.
Yeah.
Cool.

1528
01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:48.290
<v 4>Well yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
If he,
if,
if you want to support this podcast in that</v>

1529
01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.710
<v 3>whey,
which is a great way and we really appreciate it.
That's awesome stuff.
It's,</v>

1530
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:57.500
it's,
it definitely helps us do what we do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1531
01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:59.520
Thanks.
But yeah,

1532
01:41:59.550 --> 01:42:03.090
it's on [inaudible] dot com and Jocko podcast.com click through.

1533
01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.910
What other ways can people support this podcast?
Well,

1534
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.230
<v 4>obviously the obvious way.
Subscribe to it on,
on,
um,</v>

1535
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:17.590
on iTunes.
Right if you haven't already.
And then,

1536
01:42:17.591 --> 01:42:21.220
and also the youtube again and I say this all the time,

1537
01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:24.820
I'm putting more videos on there.
It's cool cause I'll put little excerpts,

1538
01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.930
you know,
where,
because people on Twitter and stuff,
there'll be like,
hey,

1539
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:33.760
can you just isolate this one excerpt of,
you know,
the Mark Lee speech that,

1540
01:42:33.761 --> 01:42:36.910
you know,
just random ones.
They'll say,
or they'll be like,
hey,

1541
01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:39.940
release this excerpt.
I want to make a video.
You know,

1542
01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:44.110
and you can get the videos from youtube and stuff.
So it'd be like,
hey episode,

1543
01:42:44.111 --> 01:42:47.350
I don't know,
40 you know,
the last closing thing I said anyway,

1544
01:42:47.351 --> 01:42:50.200
so I'll put stuff,
not just excerpts,

1545
01:42:50.201 --> 01:42:54.520
but other videos other than the whole episode of the podcast

1546
01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:59.200
<v 3>and when a lot of times when you do those,
sometimes there's just excerpts,</v>

1547
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:03.280
but sometimes there's other things happening in those excerpts.
Sure.

1548
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:06.250
I mean sometimes you make full new video,

1549
01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:11.190
like the good video to where has this been come from?
Yes.
Yes.
And I think just,

1550
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:16.030
I'll speak for the voice of everyone else and myself included and everyone else

1551
01:43:16.031 --> 01:43:18.100
that's listening,
this podcast that's not named Echo.

1552
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:23.170
I think we all want to see more videos.
That's me.
Okay.
And I'm trying to,

1553
01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.870
you know,
I'm trying to make that hint to you.

1554
01:43:25.871 --> 01:43:30.020
I think I've been making it to you for awhile.
I know it's hard work,
but,
um,

1555
01:43:30.330 --> 01:43:33.990
you know,
we're just trying to let you know,
we here on,
you know,

1556
01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.400
the listeners and the,
and the troopers here,

1557
01:43:36.401 --> 01:43:39.550
we all want to see a little bit more activity.
Yep.
And,
uh,

1558
01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:43.240
and I think I personally think that the more people are subscribing to youtube,

1559
01:43:43.241 --> 01:43:47.100
the more the more motivated you're going to get.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1560
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:50.710
I hate to see relying on motivation.
No,
no,
no.
Because I don't,

1561
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.280
I rely on that discipline.

1562
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.480
<v 4>Yeah.
And I wish you were like,
Hey,</v>

1563
01:43:53.481 --> 01:43:55.280
you know what my discipline is I'm making you know,

1564
01:43:55.281 --> 01:43:58.710
one video every two weeks by and see that kind of discipline yet really from,

1565
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:08.900
there you go.
All right,
well,
hey,
we're one step closer.
You don't expect it.

1566
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:13.820
Maybe not today.
Maybe not tomorrow,
but I'm on it.
I'm on it.
I like that.

1567
01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:17.460
Speaking of being on it,
oh look what he did there.

1568
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:24.250
Um,
okay.
So on it is supplements.

1569
01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:27.010
We all know that a lot of people,

1570
01:44:27.190 --> 01:44:29.260
a lot of people don't think that I work out just cause they don't,

1571
01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:31.890
they don't see me.
They hear my voice.
So like,
oh,
I could have,

1572
01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:34.300
it doesn't work out.
But Jocko obviously works out.

1573
01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:39.430
Jocko does sick take supplements so people are like,
oh yeah,

1574
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:42.990
jock retakes,
Krill oil.

1575
01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:49.140
Jocko takes strong bone and Jock who takes alpha?

1576
01:44:49.141 --> 01:44:53.010
Brainy.
There you go.
It's strong.
One is from honest from on it.
Okay.

1577
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:56.310
All right.
There you go.
So yeah,
these are actual supplements.

1578
01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:59.280
I take the exact same thing and not the strong,
but I sat for the strong,

1579
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:03.090
I left one out.
What shroom tech.

1580
01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:09.630
Shroom tech is good.
And I actually,

1581
01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:13.800
we trained today in Sunday.
We trained today.
We trained today harder.

1582
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:18.660
I did not take from tech today and I didn't feel like I brought my a game the

1583
01:45:18.661 --> 01:45:22.430
way I wanted to.
So it's too bad.
Yeah,

1584
01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:24.580
he was good enough.
But,

1585
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:31.050
but you know,
like I was breathing Carter

1586
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:37.260
good roles today.
Yeah.
Good.
Taylor.
Sure.
Yeah.
He's,

1587
01:45:37.650 --> 01:45:41.570
when does he compete?
Uh,
next week.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's right.
Look very similar.
Yeah,

1588
01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:46.360
he's good man.
Yeah.
This early on too.
Even if you wasn't as early on

1589
01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:52.930
anyway,
we'll talk about Taylor does as soon.
Yep.
But yeah,

1590
01:45:52.931 --> 01:45:54.700
get gate on it has the best supplements.

1591
01:45:54.730 --> 01:45:59.440
We all know that all legit cause a lot of supplements straight up don't work.

1592
01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:04.690
They do.
Some supplements rely on the placebo effect.
Literally rely on that.

1593
01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.430
Like that's its effectiveness.
That's why it's effective because of police.

1594
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.130
This placebo effect,
not on it.
You find out about their stuff on the website,

1595
01:46:12.131 --> 01:46:17.131
but if you want 10% off those supplements that you're going to get on

1596
01:46:17.591 --> 01:46:21.220
it.com/jacqueline 10% off.
Boom.
I like it.

1597
01:46:22.090 --> 01:46:24.880
So he had to do that man.
Support yourself at the same time.

1598
01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:30.400
That's what I like to think it.
And then how about those?
Uh,
my,

1599
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:34.810
what the jock was store chocolate store has some new items.
So Hey,
this is weird.

1600
01:46:34.811 --> 01:46:39.100
If you look on Instagram,
you posted a picture today.
I did.
I did.
Yes.

1601
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:42.730
But now today is relative because when this podcast comes out,

1602
01:46:42.731 --> 01:46:47.320
it won't be chair the time October 2nd.
Oh,

1603
01:46:47.321 --> 01:46:51.600
people are going to attract the date.
Okay.
Understood.
It's my dad's birthday,

1604
01:46:51.601 --> 01:46:54.840
by the way,
today.
Happy Birthday.
Aquas father,
Happy Birthday,

1605
01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:02.160
William Charles Jr Bravo,
Charlie.
But BC on call.
I Happy Birthday Dad.
Love you.

1606
01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:05.970
Um,
so on my dad's birthday,

1607
01:47:05.971 --> 01:47:10.290
Jocko posted a picture on Instagram October 2nd and one of the comments,

1608
01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:14.790
I just read it a little while ago.
Um,
it says,
hey,

1609
01:47:14.791 --> 01:47:17.910
where do I get that good shirt?
Or where do I get a Jocko shirt?
Oh,

1610
01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.840
that's an interesting question,
right?

1611
01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:25.190
Because there's only one place in the world you can get that chip and I,

1612
01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.040
and we say it a lot,
but nonetheless,

1613
01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:30.990
no one's obligated to listen to me talk about Jocko store.
Really.

1614
01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:33.750
People fast forward when they get to you talking about style.

1615
01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:36.080
I'm not surprised if people do.
I'm not sure.

1616
01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:40.310
<v 3>Are they missing some nuggets?
They're missing some information,
some information.</v>

1617
01:47:40.311 --> 01:47:44.390
I think they're missing some good times too,
potentially.
Sure.
Yes.

1618
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:48.650
So how they gonna know it was bcs birthday.

1619
01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:53.990
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Great Point.
Yeah.
So you're not going to know that.</v>

1620
01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:59.390
So I would say so don't fast forward through these,
but do what you like.

1621
01:47:59.630 --> 01:48:00.920
You know what,

1622
01:48:00.921 --> 01:48:03.500
if you're on your way to go do some pull ups or something and you're like,

1623
01:48:03.650 --> 01:48:07.940
the book's done.
We're done with the book them do some pull ups

1624
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:09.840
then

1625
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.920
<v 3>cool.
You know what's weird though,</v>

1626
01:48:10.921 --> 01:48:15.921
when you listen to other podcasts while specifically like if you listen to Joe

1627
01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:20.370
Rogan's podcast,
which I,
which I do sometimes,
they're just straight talking.

1628
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:25.650
Yeah.
Nicky,
which is,
which is what we're doing right now.
We are talking about,

1629
01:48:26.130 --> 01:48:29.850
it is enclosed around some subject matter cause we're talking about ways to

1630
01:48:29.851 --> 01:48:34.320
support the podcast.
So yeah,
but it's still,
like I said,

1631
01:48:34.321 --> 01:48:38.970
there's some nuggets in there that are important and even if they're not

1632
01:48:38.971 --> 01:48:43.070
important,
what's funny is even if they're not important,
they're in there,

1633
01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:45.840
they're the,
they're the,
this is what I think is cool is when I,

1634
01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:50.040
when I got to travel a lot and I've been traveling and I'm starting to meet just

1635
01:48:50.041 --> 01:48:53.670
like troopers everywhere,
everywhere.

1636
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:58.230
I was all over the world,
all the way from New Zealand to the east coast,

1637
01:48:58.260 --> 01:48:59.040
up and down the east coast.

1638
01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.580
I've meet meeting troopers everywhere and when I meet people,

1639
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:03.600
all of a sudden it's like,

1640
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:08.700
it's like friends that you have inside jokes with everybody I meet,
you know,

1641
01:49:08.701 --> 01:49:11.880
they make cracks about this and you know about that and it's all from the

1642
01:49:11.881 --> 01:49:15.690
podcast.
So that's kind of cool is not just,
hey,

1643
01:49:15.691 --> 01:49:19.740
get on here and get educated about life leadership,
business war.

1644
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.760
You know what,

1645
01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.870
let's have some inside jokes that we can laugh at each other at one when I show

1646
01:49:24.871 --> 01:49:26.430
up at,
you know,
you're,

1647
01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:29.970
you're whatever you work to do some work myself.

1648
01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:33.420
When people come to the gym and they'll tell me good evening,

1649
01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.610
even if it's daytime,
oh,
good evening.

1650
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
At least a quarter of the reviews for Jocko white tea.

1651
01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.620
We start off with good evening echo.

1652
01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.330
<v 4>I don't even know what started that.
I mean obviously I said it.</v>

1653
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:55.180
I think you started it.
I absolutely started it,
but,

1654
01:49:56.330 --> 01:50:00.620
but at some point,
I mean,
I don't know how else to introduce you,
right.

1655
01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.240
Other than to say we're good evening,
you sorta just kept doing it.

1656
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:10.180
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you,
your response is now standard too.
Well,

1657
01:50:10.190 --> 01:50:14.290
what else would I say?
You know?
Okay.
I guess you don't,
can't say much.
No.
Good.

1658
01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:19.610
Amen.
Could say how's it going to stick with good evening?
I think I like that.

1659
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:22.610
There it is.
But to answer that question,
let's say it's,

1660
01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:26.900
let's say someone else had that question.
Where do I get a Jocko shirt?

1661
01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.030
I'll tell you where you get a jungle shirt.
Jocko store dot.

1662
01:50:31.690 --> 01:50:33.280
That's again,

1663
01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:37.210
love the marketing on that title for that creative.

1664
01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:42.760
It's a store from Jocko.
It's unlined.com.
[inaudible] DOT com.

1665
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:47.590
Yes,
we have shirts there.
Uh,
we have travel mugs.

1666
01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.660
You know the kidney can you bring with you,

1667
01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:53.160
they're not the kind you can put your Jocko white tea.
Sure.
Yeah.

1668
01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:56.860
If you choose to.
Yes,
exactly.
And uh,
some,

1669
01:50:56.861 --> 01:51:01.810
some bumper stickers that are kind of cool.
They're on Jocko store.com as well.

1670
01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.810
Um,
there's some other sticks on there.
Cool.
We have patches.
Okay.

1671
01:51:04.811 --> 01:51:09.070
Here's the thing about the patch,
about batches.
Someone online setting.
Hey,

1672
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:13.540
get the velcro patches and man,
I'm just not as familiar with the velcro patches.

1673
01:51:13.541 --> 01:51:16.690
We already had these other two batches.
One is a Jujitsu patch.

1674
01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:19.540
The other one is that you just patch,
but it's all purpose patch.

1675
01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.160
You know you can iron out on but you still it.

1676
01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:24.670
Then it's four inches by three inches.
The velcro patch.
I'm like,

1677
01:51:24.970 --> 01:51:28.180
that's a good idea that I'll go patch.
Let me get the same thing for,

1678
01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:32.170
it's four by three.
It's a velcro patch,
so it's cool for that.

1679
01:51:32.410 --> 01:51:36.040
But you explain to me those velcro patches are interchangeable.

1680
01:51:36.041 --> 01:51:39.040
The standard is three by two,
three across.

1681
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:44.770
So just understand the velcro patch currently right now is four by three.

1682
01:51:44.771 --> 01:51:48.500
Did you get to I threw in the ordered.
Yeah.
So I got to,
you know,

1683
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:53.140
I didn't finalize it but they come in pretty quick.
So just know,

1684
01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:56.650
just be aware of the dementia of the patch if you want to do the interchangeable

1685
01:51:56.651 --> 01:51:56.831
one.

1686
01:51:56.831 --> 01:52:00.280
I guess technically you could put the four by three but we're not doing that.

1687
01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:04.830
Well,
I'll get the two by three and on.
Encourage that kind of,
yeah,
yeah,

1688
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:09.670
please.
Nonetheless,
they're on Jocko stores.
Well,

1689
01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.850
the Jujitsu patches there too.
Like I said,

1690
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:17.830
her rash guards are there big time all on the job.

1691
01:52:17.831 --> 01:52:22.030
Go store somewhere on backorder,
but they're there in full effect for sure.

1692
01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.193
And they're good.

1693
01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:25.123
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:28.000
<v 4>Five emails today</v>

1695
01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:34.040
saying they felt the 19% performance allegedly there's no alleged about it.

1696
01:52:36.150 --> 01:52:36.983
Straight up,
legit.

1697
01:52:37.110 --> 01:52:40.660
How can you say that to legend when people at factually felt the difference that

1698
01:52:40.690 --> 01:52:43.260
that's just what being a skeptic.
It's what they said.

1699
01:52:43.261 --> 01:52:44.920
I wasn't there to witness it.
Oh,

1700
01:52:45.370 --> 01:52:48.080
where's he going to tell you they had a 19% improvement?
If they did not,

1701
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.960
they alleged it that it was an allegation.

1702
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:55.010
I don't support you on were fallen out of grace.
Your man.

1703
01:52:55.610 --> 01:52:58.700
When somebody tells me they got 19% improvement with the rash guard type,

1704
01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:01.850
get as fat.
Why would they lie to you?
Yeah,
you're right.

1705
01:53:02.010 --> 01:53:03.530
Otherwise they'd be saying,
Hey,
give me my money back.

1706
01:53:03.531 --> 01:53:07.790
I didn't get a 19% performance increase.
That's due two very good points.

1707
01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:13.580
And we have women's tank tops.
I understand fall,

1708
01:53:13.610 --> 01:53:16.010
we're going into winter soon.
Tank tops

1709
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:23.330
or southern hemisphere people.
Sure.
Yeah,
the West,
because it's summer down there.

1710
01:53:23.331 --> 01:53:25.250
It's going to be summertime soon down in uh,

1711
01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:30.400
down in New Zealand and Australia and South America and the Hawaii people as

1712
01:53:31.221 --> 01:53:34.860
well from quiet.
We didn't know about that kind.
And that's what you,

1713
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:39.440
where you were saying you don't understand what a Hoodie is from quiet like we

1714
01:53:39.441 --> 01:53:41.900
kind of,
we know what a Hoodie is.

1715
01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:45.350
We're making hoodies.
Yes.

1716
01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:50.380
So I mean we made with consultation from Jocko and some New England people,

1717
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:57.680
we got hoodies on the way as well.
And women's tee shirts as well.

1718
01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:02.930
Yeah.
I was explaining to echo that in new England like a Hoodie is,

1719
01:54:04.190 --> 01:54:09.190
is like something you wear every single day for nine months out of the year.

1720
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:13.910
You wear a Hoodie.
I'm waking up and putting on a Hoodie.
Yeah,
that's what,

1721
01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:15.290
that's what you do.
Yeah.
See.

1722
01:54:15.291 --> 01:54:18.830
So we've got to make sure we were going to make them awesome so that people will

1723
01:54:18.831 --> 01:54:23.831
be fired up and representing with their hoodie and they'll be toasty warm.

1724
01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:27.650
Yeah.
What's interesting,
for lack of a better term,

1725
01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:31.700
my wife is one of the those Hoodie people,
you know,

1726
01:54:31.701 --> 01:54:34.850
the kind of words to wear the Hoodie every single day.
Even when it's not cold.

1727
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:37.370
She'll be like,
well it's like a comfort zone thing.
You know,

1728
01:54:37.710 --> 01:54:38.630
there's a bunch of them,

1729
01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.920
but I don't even know how many she even took Greg Trains Victory Hoodie and she

1730
01:54:45.831 --> 01:54:49.280
uses Alan.
That was like one of her many.
Anyway,
that's a good hook.
That was that.

1731
01:54:49.281 --> 01:54:53.630
Those are good hoodies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Curious.
So,
um,
yeah,

1732
01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:55.790
so there it is.
We're going to have that coming out.

1733
01:54:55.791 --> 01:54:58.220
That should be within the next two to three weeks.

1734
01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:04.040
I think that's a fair amount of time to say and it'd be accurate.
Um,
so they,
ah,

1735
01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:04.821
there it is Jocko,

1736
01:55:04.821 --> 01:55:08.840
store.com in the event of you wanting to support this podcast in that way,

1737
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:12.590
get some stuff,
give them us being two things,
whatever you want.
Once again,

1738
01:55:12.710 --> 01:55:16.190
appreciate all that support it.
Also if you want,

1739
01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:20.030
if you don't have a book that was written by a guy named Leif Babin,

1740
01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:23.620
my brother and myself,
we wrote a book called extreme ownership.

1741
01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:25.640
If you want to pick it up,
you can pick it up.

1742
01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:30.050
You'd get it on Amazon or anywhere else that they sell books and get,

1743
01:55:30.051 --> 01:55:32.360
we get so much good feedback on it.
It's awesome.

1744
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:37.310
I appreciate all the positive feedback.
You know,
people read it and they say,

1745
01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:41.480
this really helped me,
you know,
not just with the way I'm doing my business,

1746
01:55:41.481 --> 01:55:44.100
but like with the normal stuff in the,
and

1747
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.640
<v 3>other cool thing is when people buy it for their team or they even buy it for</v>

1748
01:55:47.641 --> 01:55:51.600
the boss sometimes.
So pick up extreme ownership.
We did the audio too.

1749
01:55:51.601 --> 01:55:53.910
If you want to read it,
if you don't want to read it cause you don't have time,

1750
01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:56.460
you just want to listen to it while you're in a,
in a traffic jam,

1751
01:55:56.730 --> 01:56:00.750
then just buy the audio book and you'll be good to go.
So appreciate that.

1752
01:56:00.751 --> 01:56:04.680
And then also if you dig that extreme ownership,
you dig that concept,

1753
01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.280
you can come out to a little something we're having here in southern California

1754
01:56:08.490 --> 01:56:11.490
in San Diego called the muster,
the extreme ownership muster.

1755
01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:15.300
We're going to be talking about leadership are going to be talking about how to

1756
01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:17.130
take the lessons that we learned in combat,

1757
01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:22.580
which had been proven in combat and how you can apply those same lessons doing

1758
01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:25.920
leadership in business leadership in life.

1759
01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:31.080
So we got a bunch of,
you are coming to us and it's awesome.
So,

1760
01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:36.380
and I had somebody email me the other day and it said said,

1761
01:56:36.511 --> 01:56:39.660
hey,
listen,
I just wanted to let you know I'm coming to the muster,

1762
01:56:39.690 --> 01:56:43.980
but in any event,
I don't get to meet you there.
Then,
uh,
you know,

1763
01:56:43.981 --> 01:56:45.990
I just want to let you know,
I really appreciate,
you know,

1764
01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.250
the podcast and the book and all that.
And I didn't even respond yet.

1765
01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:52.350
I don't think so.
I get a lot of emails,
but let me tell you something.

1766
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.450
If you come to the muster where hanging out,

1767
01:56:54.690 --> 01:56:57.030
it's not going to be one of these gigs where you know,

1768
01:56:57.031 --> 01:57:01.740
I'm back in the green room waiting to go out.
Um,
getting in character.
Well No,

1769
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:05.860
I,
this is my character and I won't be backstage.
I'll be in,

1770
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:08.070
I'll be sitting at a table with you.
I'll be talking,

1771
01:57:08.071 --> 01:57:10.260
I'll be and laced can be doing the same thing.

1772
01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:15.190
So that's one of the major differentiators we want to have in this thing is that

1773
01:57:15.191 --> 01:57:15.781
because you know,

1774
01:57:15.781 --> 01:57:18.540
Lafe and I go to these events all the time cause we speak at them,
they'd,

1775
01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:20.580
you know,
leadership events and conferences and all that.

1776
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.060
The biggest differentiator that we want to make is we want to be,

1777
01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:27.330
we want to have the contact that we want to have the face to face.

1778
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:31.560
So if your common that not only are you gonna meet me,
we're going to kick it,

1779
01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.810
we're going to be hanging out,
we're going to be having dinner,
lunch,

1780
01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:36.090
we're going to be going over problems when we talk about solutions.

1781
01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:39.090
So don't think that I'm going to be,
um,

1782
01:57:39.210 --> 01:57:41.760
and that and that life is going to be all hiding in the background.

1783
01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.420
Now we're going to be there.
I'll be meeting you what we do in a workout.
Also,

1784
01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:48.480
some people want to try,
if you train legend Jitsu and you come out here,

1785
01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:53.460
come out here a little bit early or stay a little bit late and we're going to go

1786
01:57:53.461 --> 01:57:54.090
to the gym,

1787
01:57:54.090 --> 01:57:57.840
we're going to have a victory MMA and you can challenge Echo Charles to a death

1788
01:57:57.841 --> 01:58:02.790
match.
We'll be there.
We'll be there.
Rolling.
So,
um,
you know,

1789
01:58:02.791 --> 01:58:06.720
if you,
if you stay,
if you stay Friday,
if you stay Saturday,
if you stay Sunday,

1790
01:58:07.050 --> 01:58:11.130
I will be there Friday night.
I'll be there Saturday day,

1791
01:58:11.190 --> 01:58:13.440
I'll be there Sunday day and we'll be getting it on.

1792
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:16.920
So come on out for that,

1793
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:20.160
for that muster and that'll be,
that'll be awesome.

1794
01:58:20.161 --> 01:58:22.740
Also if you can't come out to the muster,

1795
01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:27.540
but you just want to kind of kick it and keep these things going on and you want

1796
01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:28.830
to join the crew,

1797
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:33.600
then all you've got to do is get on social media,

1798
01:58:34.290 --> 01:58:38.550
which,
which I didn't really understand social media a year ago,
you know,

1799
01:58:38.610 --> 01:58:39.780
I didn't know what it was all about.

1800
01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:44.140
But now what I know is I get to talk to people and I get to get to grow in my

1801
01:58:44.141 --> 01:58:47.980
knowledge from other people who,
who can communicate things,

1802
01:58:47.981 --> 01:58:50.980
who ask really good questions that I got to get research or I know an answer to.

1803
01:58:50.981 --> 01:58:53.230
And then they asked me something else.
And so,
so that's awesome.

1804
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:57.430
And Funny Bunch of people post all kinds of funny self soul and getting

1805
01:58:57.490 --> 01:59:00.790
entertained and we're getting,
you know,

1806
01:59:00.850 --> 01:59:05.510
a crew and having a bunch of people there that are likeminded and is,
is,

1807
01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:09.910
is fun to have.
And so I appreciate it.

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:44.530
We don't think we have time for the Q and.

Work with police officers,

1822
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.480

1823
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:12.400
Thank all of you.

1824
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:16.900
You all your uniform folks for what you do for holding the line overseas and

1825
02:00:16.901 --> 02:00:19.030
here at home and for everybody else that I'm mean,

1826
02:00:19.031 --> 02:00:22.720
I'm meeting people from all kinds of businesses.
All of you have goals.

1827
02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:25.480
You're trying to make things happen.
You're truck,
you're not calling,

1828
02:00:25.690 --> 02:00:26.590
you're not calling us up.

1829
02:00:26.591 --> 02:00:28.960
You're not calling Nathan I up unless you're trying to dominate.

1830
02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:33.250
So we love the fact that we get to go to places where you've got people that are

1831
02:00:33.251 --> 02:00:36.160
out there trying to kick ass,
trying to cut,
crush it.

1832
02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:39.760
And that's what propels America and keeps our country strong,

1833
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:41.050
keeps our country free.

1834
02:00:41.170 --> 02:00:46.000
So thank you for what you're doing in all those jobs,

1835
02:00:46.001 --> 02:00:49.210
