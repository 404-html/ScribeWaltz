This is Jocko podcast number one 17 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.520
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.890
And we're doing a Q and a tonight.
First one in a while,

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.240
had a bunch of other guests and books and whatnot.
So Q and a.

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's go.
Cool.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.840
First Question Jocko from one 15 podcast,

7
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:26.610
number one 15 as a leader,

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.350
how best to respond to someone like Corporal Meyer when he brings up good

9
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.351
questions in a brief that need to be addressed without derailing the brief and

10
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.830
calling your com pretense slash authority into question.

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.590
Okay,
so what he's talking about is on podcast one 15 with Dakota Meyer,

12
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:48.490
which if you haven't listened to it,
listen to it,

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.970
it's long and it's very,
I dunno,
it's,
it's awesome.

14
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.680
Anyways,
in part of that podcast,
Dakota,

15
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.150
his getting told how they're going to conduct this operation and Dakota raises

16
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:05.010
some point and says,
what about this?
What about that?

17
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:08.640
And what about this other thing?
And they don't listen to them.

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.180
And so the question here is if you're in charge,

19
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.720
you're the leader and you get someone that brings up these questions during a

20
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:20.010
brief,
during the plan that you need to be that need to be addressed.

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.850
How do you do it?
How do you handle that properly?
Okay,
well first of all,

22
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.350
and the most important part of this is if you involve your team in the planning

23
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:31.500
itself,
you won't have these questions come up during the brief.

24
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.830
They'll come up during the planning.
So that's,

25
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.110
that's the ultimate and best way to solve this problem.

26
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.580
You don't plan in a vacuum as the leader and then present the plan to the troops

27
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.860
and expect that you're going to have the perfect plan.

28
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.370
It was only your brain working on it.
What about everyone else's brain?
What?

29
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:48.750
I'm not on everyone else's perspective.

30
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.240
They have experience and they have knowledge that you don't have.

31
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.930
So if you involve them in the planning,

32
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.590
then they ask you those questions early and you figured out what the right

33
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
answers to those questions are.
So that's how you solved the problem right there.

34
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.720
Now if it happens that for whatever reason you're,

35
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.140
you didn't have the opportunity to do that or you didn't do it well enough or

36
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.190
whatever the case may be,

37
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.260
and now you start getting questions on your plan while you're briefing.
Well,

38
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.520
first of all,
if they ask you questions that you don't have answers to,

39
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.020
then that,
then that could indicate that you're wrong.
Actually,

40
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.080
you could actually be wrong and not a lot of leaders like to feel that way,

41
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.770
but you should actually be happy that someone on your team is pointing out

42
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:37.110
something that is gonna make the plan better as a whole.

43
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.510
So there's that and it's really easy if someone,

44
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.960
if you're in a brief and someone brings up a point that you didn't think of and

45
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.800
it makes sense,
well then you can implement that into the plan.
Okay,

46
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:54.801
so that now you might think that it hurts your authority,

47
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.140
right?
To say,
hey,
that's a good point.
Echo,
I think of that.
Let's implement.

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.310
You might think or feel like that's going to make you look bad,

49
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.090
but it's the opposite is actually true.
If I go no echo,
hey,

50
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.550
the plans already completed.
You weren't there for the planning,
so just be quiet.

51
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.920
That's the guy that no one respects.

52
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.550
That's the guy that's not looking good as a leader and that's the person that's

53
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.910
losing authority so you don't look weak.
If you listen to members of the team,

54
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.170
whether they're junior or senior,

55
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.170
it also shows that you're incompetent if you,

56
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.210
because you,
because you missed a part.

57
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.650
Obviously the question is pertinent that they asked or I should say if the

58
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:34.450
question is pertinent ended as a good point,

59
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.250
then it shows that you missed an important angle of the plan.
So

60
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.340
open your mind,
open your,
put your ego in check and incorporate it in there.

61
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.180
Now this can also happen if there's something that you know that you're right

62
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.250
on,
but something that you know that you're right on.

63
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.660
If there's something like that
and you and this,
but you know,

64
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.390
maybe you get one particular individual that's keeps pushing back and keeps

65
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:06.391
pushing back and you might have to in those cases say,

66
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.770
you know what?
Hey Echo.
Let me,

67
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:11.560
let me talk to you after this brief is over and explain to you exactly why we're

68
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:12.394
doing it this way.

69
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.820
So that way it doesn't derail the brief because it might take a longer

70
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.860
explanation than you want to.
You know,
for instance,

71
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:22.600
the typical seal briefing was we tried to keep it 50 minutes to an hour.

72
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.703
So if you have got to,

73
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.430
if you've got to spend eight minutes pulling up a different map and explaining

74
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.030
some detail of the terrain to this guy that has a protest to what you're saying,

75
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.000
you might say,
Hey,
listen,
when we get done with this brief,
I'll pull you aside.

76
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:34.570
Let me show you the,

77
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.970
let me show you the terrain map and you can see exactly why we're using this

78
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.630
insertion route or whatever the case may be.
Uh,

79
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.730
so you can do that if you have to.

80
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.390
And even then they might end up having a point that you didn't see and then you

81
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:49.210
can say,
okay,
well I didn't see that.
And now we have to give everyone a quick,

82
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.830
quick on a rib reefing on some change in the plan.
But again,

83
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.190
none of this will happen if you bring your subordinates in and you let them do

84
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.530
it.
First of all,
let them do the planning.
That's ideal.

85
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.630
Let them come up with Atlanta.
Let Echo come up with a plan.

86
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.430
I'm not coming up with a plan.
You go come up with a plan.

87
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.250
I'm going to check with you and make sure that the plan is going in the right

88
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:09.641
direction.

89
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:14.641
Make sure it's not totally off track and then you'll incorporate all these

90
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:17.200
things and I'll have a better view of the plan.

91
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.960
I can stand back and be the tactical genius as we talk about in the book.

92
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:22.330
Extreme ownership.
Like that's how you do it.

93
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.360
So that's the answer.

94
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.970
What have at least an answer.
Yeah.

95
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.600
Maybe other people have other answers.
Seems to make sense to me.

96
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.790
<v 1>Yeah,
that's that hard.
It's hard,
right?
When you,
when you,</v>

97
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.100
it's one of the things you always gotta be conscious of when you have a plan or

98
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.110
whatever and someone for lack of better term pokes holes in it and be like,

99
00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:49.070
Hey,
what about this?
What about this?

100
00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:52.970
And then you have the that those two elements that you got to keep in mind where

101
00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:55.550
it's like the fact that it's your plan and then the plan,

102
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.190
you know the effectiveness of your emotional attachment

103
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.250
<v 0>to the plan.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.130
You got to keep the emotional attachment to the plant in Jack versus the actual

105
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.740
effectiveness of the plan and people have a hard time doing that.

106
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.790
And what's cool,

107
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.200
what's cool is once you break away from that mindset and it's really easy just

108
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.720
to be,
and everyone just kind of knows,
Oh yeah,
Jack was here,

109
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.771
he's got an open mind,

110
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:19.490
he'll listen to you as opposed to someone that has a closed mind ever goes out.

111
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.060
You can't,
you can't get anything by this guy who just,
he's just got to keep,

112
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.240
he doesn't even help to point things out cause he won't listen.

113
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.171
And then guess what?

114
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:32.171
You're using one brain versus 20 brains and more important than the brainpower,

115
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.820
the perspective,
the different perspectives.

116
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:37.250
Cause the guys in the ground of the guys with the technical knowledge and the

117
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.950
tactical knowledge,
they're going to know things that you don't know.

118
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.250
That's the way it is.
You can't know everything that they know.

119
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.440
And so if you shut down all those different perspectives,

120
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.010
you're looking at something from one angle and do you see the whole complete

121
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.070
picture when you only look at something from one ankle?
No,
you don't.
No Sir.

122
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.130
Use those other perspectives.
You know,

123
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.490
check self correcting machine.

124
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.060
He's getting let go of the ego,
the taking it personal.

125
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.520
When I was in the seal teams,

126
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.580
I called it the emotional attachment to the plan because I can see these people

127
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:13.790
come up with plans and they would be so addicted to their own plan only because

128
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:15.920
it was their own plan,
not for any Knob,

129
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:18.650
for any tactical or strategic or operational reason whatsoever.

130
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.840
They just liked it cause they thought of it.
It's natural.
It's very natural.

131
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.190
And there's some element of of benefit to that,
right?

132
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.040
Because if you're passionate about your plan and I'm passionate about my plan,

133
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.650
as long as we can eventually come to compromise,

134
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.170
then we've put forth the best idea.

135
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.660
Because I don't want you to not be passionate about your plan while you're

136
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:39.170
planning it.

137
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.320
I want you to really come up the best plan that you really believe it and,

138
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.500
and it's interesting,
you know you talk about poking holes,
right?

139
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.880
Poking holes in the plan and we all know that it's very easy to sit back and

140
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:50.780
poke holes in the plan.

141
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.280
And what I'm telling you to do as a leader is to absolutely do that.

142
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.190
Not Be a jerk.
No,
no.
And I'm talking to as a leader,
if I,

143
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.140
if I let you do the planning,

144
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.620
but it's easy for me to sit back and poke holes in the plan,
which is good.

145
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.410
It's good because we're going to come up with,
we're going to fill those holes.

146
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.701
Once I poked the holes,

147
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:09.380
we're going to fill them and we're going to know that they're taken care of.

148
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.510
Also as a leader from a,
from a perspective point,
you think,

149
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.130
hey Jocko really knows what's going on.

150
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:18.290
He was able to find these holes in the plan.

151
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.120
The real reason I was able to find them.

152
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:25.121
It's just cause I was not totally at at minuscule detail with the plan you were,

153
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.410
I was up at altitude,
relaxing,
looking around.
Yeah.
It's kind of,

154
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.100
I don't want to say cheating such heating but it is cheating is cheating is

155
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:38.630
cheating.
It's that much easier.

156
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.650
It's so much easier to sit back and do it and let things go that way.

157
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.710
Like when you know when you watch a movie and you have like some critique the

158
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:48.400
movies outstanding and then you have some critique I have,

159
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:51.140
they shouldn't have chose that guy for that role or whatever.

160
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.010
Meanwhile the movies like groundbreaking,
whatever,
you know,

161
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.400
so it's easy to poke holes the movie.
Meanwhile

162
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.750
<v 1>like yeah,
yeah.</v>

163
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.520
When it's done you're all like poking holes at the little imperfections.

164
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.510
Do that all the time.
It makes sense.
Dig It.

165
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.290
<v 0>Does that happen with your videos?
Is that what I'm saying?</v>

166
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.220
Probably Jack.

167
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.050
<v 1>Anyway,
next question.</v>

168
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.920
We have been training Jujitsu for two months now.

169
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.390
We started actually rolling a few weeks ago from our knees on the mat,

170
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.970
like not starting from standing.
Basically.

171
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.950
I've trained for an executed multiple,
oh,

172
00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:33.170
I've trained for and executed multiple marathons,
competed,

173
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.850
completed a number of tough mudders,
trained hard and crossfit,
hiked,
biked,
swam,

174
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.230
and nothing compares to the total mental and physical exhaustion I feel after

175
00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:47.000
training Jujitsu.
How can I combat this time,

176
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.280
train more supplements.
Just suck it up.
When I get home,

177
00:09:52.281 --> 00:09:55.490
I'm so beat in the next morning I wake up feeling like I was hit by a bus.

178
00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.260
I know that feeling right away despite the exhaustion and still sucking at it

179
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.490
<v 0>for fun.
Okay,</v>

180
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:07.200
so that's the Jujitsu that's and okay,
so there's a couple of things here.
Yes.

181
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.530
It's going to take some time.
You're gonna have to train you train more.

182
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.530
Your body will become conditioned to it.
That's probably number one.

183
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.570
Number two is,
and this is so hard for people to do.

184
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.700
Relax.
Yeah.
It's really hard,
really hard for people to do,

185
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:24.960
especially when you first start out.

186
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.080
I realized that the way you get to a point when you start to relax

187
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.380
is when you're,
when,

188
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:39.410
when the capability of your technique surpasses the capability of your strength.

189
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.500
So if I know that I can escape your choke attempt by holding your hand and

190
00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:53.040
pulling your thumb and pull your arm off.
And that's what I know,

191
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.780
that's what I'm going to do.

192
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.070
And when I realized that I can use a technical escape of swimming my arm in and

193
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:02.610
then placing my hips on the ground and then scooting away from your choke,

194
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.810
I'll do that instead.
But,

195
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.450
but until we figure out the techniques,
all we have is muscle.

196
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:12.210
So you,
the way you do is you just have to keep,

197
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.280
keep training and keep training and try.
You can try.
Can people actually,

198
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:20.820
when they try and relax,
do they actually get you?
You tell me.

199
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.140
Cause I always tell people like,
relax more rob.

200
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.800
Like some will say I just can't relax and I'll be like,
relax harder.

201
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.760
Yeah.
But,
but it's hard.

202
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.010
It's so hard for people to relax because people say,
oh,
and I relax.

203
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:39.660
I just get submitted.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.
So,
but if you relax,

204
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.410
you'll at least be aware of what's happening.
And if you relax,

205
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.240
you can think about the technical,

206
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.240
the technical movement that you're supposed to do to escape.
Yeah,

207
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.040
yeah,
yeah.
I feel like,
just like how you

208
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.640
<v 1>said though,
if you don't know the move,</v>

209
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.510
you're just going to go with what you know and it's gonna be a spazz in one way

210
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:05.970
or another.
Jay,
you know,
if a guy's on you ever affect it?

211
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.180
Well,
cause I,
cause I'll,
I'll go into,
yes,
yes.

212
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.020
Sometimes I have to spazz and dean calls me out on that a long,
well,

213
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:15.310
here's the thing about good defense.

214
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:20.311
You just spasm will but has a big more than a sprinkle of technique in it

215
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:24.390
though.
That's the thing if true,
like you and I told you this one time,

216
00:12:24.391 --> 00:12:25.420
you know how like if you say,
yeah,

217
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:28.480
you're strong and that's kind of an insult in Jiujitsu because it's like saying,

218
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.220
yeah,
you're strong but you don't have tech.

219
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.410
It's kind of like that's what you're implying.
But,

220
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:35.770
and I said this to you one time,
I was like,
you have like strength,
you're strong.

221
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.910
And you were like,
not defensive,
but you were like,
no,

222
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:43.210
I have technique or whatever.
And I was like,
yeah,
I know that.
I was like,
shoot,

223
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:46.660
that sounded bad.
I mean,
you have technique,

224
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.960
we already know that you've been training for 25 million years and you have good

225
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:54.160
technique.
But with that technique is like a lot of strength in there.

226
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.900
Like when you,
um,
there's like stuff,
oh yeah.
When like if,

227
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.640
if I'll be inside control on,
on top on you and you have this like first off,

228
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.010
your hands are in the correct spot just to begin with.
It has to be,

229
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.390
and you can just kinda get your leg and real easy every single time.
Like,

230
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:14.110
I can't talk to stock it,
stop it.
And I'm not weak.
I'm not weak.

231
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.100
But it's like the strength of that move is like,
oh,
it's unstoppable.

232
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.550
And that's when I said it and I was like,
you're,

233
00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:23.020
you're like strong when you do a technique.
It's like,
it's a strong technique.

234
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.860
And I would say though there's a lot,

235
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.620
I would say it's probably 70% technique and 30% strength,
which,

236
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:34.621
which may confirm what you're saying that 30% strength is still more than if

237
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:40.450
someone has 70% technique.
What they have only 10% strength to get back it up.

238
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.170
Yeah,
fully.
And even saying it's you know,

239
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:48.390
70% technique,
30% strength,
I mean that's going to vary from time,

240
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.680
from moment to moment or experience sixth street.

241
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.490
So if you're spasm even that's going to be a spectrum.

242
00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:56.860
Like how much strength did you use?
There's this technique kind of thing.

243
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.100
Cause you can't spouse for a long time.
Nope you can,

244
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.470
you'll just be tired of you get to speed gassed.
Yeah.

245
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.110
So when I say you're strong,
here's the thing.
The fact is your strong,

246
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.840
regardless of your technique or not,
you can lift a lot of weights.

247
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.040
You're big trick grab.

248
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.020
Like I'll grab your wrist and when you break the grip of the wrist,

249
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.210
it's way more violent than the typical person.
You're a strong person.

250
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.750
So there's no denying that.
I know it sounds like an insult winner,

251
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.530
but nonetheless back to the point yet.
And so if you,

252
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:27.430
if you have strength going in before you gain all that technique over the,

253
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.740
over the years,
just like how you said that's what you're going to use it.

254
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:35.040
So the key is here I think is to consciously,

255
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.120
and it's not easy consciously focused on the technique consciously like
remember,

256
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:41.860
okay,
where am I?
How many half guard right now?

257
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.770
Because you know how like in the beginning when you first learned that the

258
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:48.100
positions,
you're like half guard is real clear guard is real clear.

259
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.650
When you start rolling around,
you're halfway upside down.
Maybe twisting,

260
00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:52.250
maybe your arms

261
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.050
<v 0>in the wrong spot across your buddy or something like that.</v>

262
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.180
You kind of don't remember a week.
I'm in half guard right now or an upside down.

263
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:03.260
But I mean,
you know,
I'm on his back still,
whatever.
So you don't,

264
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.890
he doesn't just stick in your mind what position you're in.

265
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.700
But if you can do that then it starts getting getting routine.
So now you,

266
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:14.430
after that you can figure out,
okay,
am I safe here?
Because that's why you spend,

267
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.600
that's why you can't relax because you don't know if you're safe or not.

268
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.960
So you're just trying to move in and get out of there or,
or you know,

269
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:23.300
get that submission herea before he does something.
You know,

270
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.950
where the supplies to life,

271
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:30.370
this applies to life in when you're interacting with other people and you start

272
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:36.230
to,
let's say you and I are having a disagreement about something,
right?

273
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.470
And you start getting the upper hand on me and instead of me trying to use a

274
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:47.990
technique to get out,
all I do is go the stupid echo.
You're done.
Right?

275
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.270
I just started interrupting or cutting off raising my voice.

276
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.130
I'm actually losing now and I don't,
you know,

277
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.660
but I'm relying on brute force as opposed to technique.

278
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.030
Now it could be also,
like we talked about earlier,

279
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:06.530
it could be that I'm wrong and if instead of admitting that I'm wrong or,

280
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:09.950
or taking,
like you're saying,
relax and looking at the technique and saying,

281
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:14.300
you know what?
Echo has a point here that I can't debate against.

282
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.720
He's right and I'm wrong.
I need to admit that.
Same thing.

283
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:21.440
If you came up with an idea for the plan and your idea was better than mine,

284
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:25.700
or you had a point that I needed to bring into the plan,
unless I almost,

285
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:29.660
I can relax and actually pay attention,
then I'm not gonna be able to do that.

286
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.160
So that's how,
that's one of the many ways when I was talking about Jujitsu,

287
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.580
applying to life.
This is another example of where,
hey,

288
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:42.470
if the argument starts to escalate and you're using brute force to get out of
it,

289
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.140
you're not winning.
Just like you're not winning in Jujitsu.

290
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.590
It's if you're going to gas out and you're going to,
you're going to lose.
Yeah.

291
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.990
Don't use brute force.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not even 30% well,

292
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.920
maybe sometimes 30% it's okay.

293
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.980
The other thing is the other thing that's hard and it's,
well,
it's,

294
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.010
it's attached to what you're saying.

295
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.510
Don't have death matches every time.
Yeah.
Right.

296
00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:07.820
Don't like you find a partner and just be like,
okay,

297
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:11.570
let's try and make sure that we're not using so much strength.

298
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.080
I can roll with you or with dean or with Andy or whoever for a long time and,

299
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.770
and it's,
you know,
we're sweating or tired,

300
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.790
but we're not using all this strength.
You don't walk in off the mat with,
with,

301
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.420
with like burned out muscles.
It's a difference.

302
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:34.421
More of a cardio I would say then then a strength thing when you get to a higher

303
00:17:34.611 --> 00:17:37.640
level because you're,
you're just movement.
It's movement that's happening.

304
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.600
You know when to,

305
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.840
you know when someone's going to accomplish something and if you're going to

306
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:45.260
fight it with muscle,
you're gonna,
you're gonna end up losing.
Yeah.

307
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.100
And it goes back to the time thing where I was,
is it more time

308
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.270
<v 2>in the dancers?
Yeah,
it's more time.
Cause like you,
you learn that.
And again,</v>

309
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:58.230
like where you knowing where to be and where not to be,
where you're safe in,

310
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:01.830
where you're not safe in Jujitsu is a big deal.
So you know how like,
okay,

311
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:06.210
let's say,
and I know this with you because let's say if I pass your guard,
sorry,

312
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:10.860
you let me pass your card.
I don't know.
You don't spazz and like,
you know,

313
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:14.100
like in a tournament where the guy's like really trying hard not to let you

314
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:17.010
settle in guard.
And so that's a different scenario of course.

315
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:21.120
But you never do that.
You,
it's like you get to a point,
pass your guard.

316
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:23.160
Once you kind of get there,
you just,
you set on your,

317
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.110
you're kind of relaxing because you,

318
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.200
it seems like anyway that you know you're not in danger for a submission.

319
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.630
So that's kind of really where the focus is.
It's not the fact that,
Ooh,

320
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:36.600
he passing my guard.
Oh no,
that's terrible.
It's not that.

321
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.770
It's okay now what technique do I need to implement to keep myself safe?

322
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.460
And the more you know about Jujitsu,

323
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.240
the more you realize it doesn't take a huge amount of energy to,

324
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.590
to implement that technique.
It's usually just like an arm position.

325
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.750
Make sure his hip is like over there and not over here.
And that's kind of,

326
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.560
that's it.
That's pretty much it.
But if you don't know that you're like,
oh man,

327
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.690
you're using your whole body to get out of there kind of thing.
And that's,

328
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.090
that's when you're leaving.
No reserves in a military perspective.

329
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.120
In the military,
you're always supposed to keep your reserve as long as you can.

330
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.590
Oh yeah.
You're just trying to spazz out and get out of a dominant position.

331
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.520
It also attacking a dominant position when you're responding to try and get out.

332
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.300
You're,
you're just going crazy trying to get out of this confirmed position.

333
00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:22.320
I mean,
across the side or the mount.
Those are positions that are really sure.

334
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:25.290
There's a transitional time when you should definitely spazz to try and get out.

335
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.430
Once that's surpassed,
well now you're just,
you're just expanding energy.
Yeah.

336
00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.740
So check your diet too.
If you're like really sore and everything,

337
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.260
make sure you're getting enough protein.
Make sure to get enough fat.

338
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.050
Make sure you're getting,
maybe get some,

339
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.620
get some super krill or some or some joint warfare or both because

340
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.320
your body needs it.
So just other things to try and put off that

341
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.400
soreness and the pain.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Well that twisting.
Yeah,

342
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:59.910
there's definitely,
you know,
well,
yeah,
it's hard on your joints.
Yeah.
Yeah.

343
00:19:59.911 --> 00:20:02.510
Die Hard.
It's like us not to get a workout,
you know,

344
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.860
they get a workout that you won't be getting doing other stuff unless you know

345
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.970
construction or something,
you know,
something like that.
Same thing.

346
00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:13.800
You're going to get joint stuff.
That's how,
but yeah,
keep it supposed to be fun.

347
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.660
The death matches still death matches.
Yeah.

348
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.730
White Belt death matches probably.
Um,

349
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.010
I would estimate 40% of all injuries in Jujitsu come from white belt death

350
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:29.310
matches.
Is that you think that's a good number?
Yeah.
If not higher.
Not Higher.

351
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.280
Yeah.
Full on.
Yeah.

352
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.520
Cool.
Next question.
You talk about,

353
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.470
you talk about empathy and perspective and building relationships as a leader,

354
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.060
but I look at leader,

355
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.130
a leader like Steve Jobs who's known for his hostile attitude toward

356
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.390
<v 0>people.
Isn't that being default aggressive?
Like you talk about,</v>

357
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.320
if I'm more naturally that type of leader,
should I go with it?

358
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.420
If it worked for Steve Jobs,
shouldn't it work for me?
So

359
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.850
that's a good question.

360
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.470
And I haven't actually read the book about Steve Jobs and I think there's

361
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:10.580
probably more than one,
but there's the one that's real popular,

362
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.270
real thick and someone gave it to me and I have it and I will someday.

363
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:16.540
But I haven't read it yet.
And I've heard it's really good.
And all that.
And I,

364
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:21.940
that being said,
I've,
I've heard the same things about,

365
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.020
you know,
Steve Jobs,
that leadership style,
he was real tyrannical.

366
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.480
And I pulled a couple things here just from,

367
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.960
well here we go in his book about jobs time at next and returned to apple the

368
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.480
second coming of Steve Jobs,

369
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:43.050
Alan Deutschman described job's rough treatment of his underlings.

370
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.280
He would praise is a quote,

371
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:48.340
he would praise and inspire them often in very creative ways,

372
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.050
but he would also resort too intimidating,
goading berating,
belittling,

373
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.460
belittling and even nick humiliating them.
So,

374
00:21:57.461 --> 00:22:02.461
and there's another article by Ronald Riggio who's a phd in psychology and the,

375
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:09.010
and the article came from psychology today and it says he was obsessive,

376
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:12.940
we controlling and given to fits of rage,

377
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.390
throwing tantrums and yelling at employees and board members.

378
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.600
He could tear down someone's ideas or the person himself in a public display,

379
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:27.390
some of said he took credit for others ideas and his confidence led to a sort of

380
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.650
over the top arrogance.

381
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.820
So the guys kind of tyrannical one time when they were putting together the

382
00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:41.800
mobile application and it wasn't working well and jobs told the team that was

383
00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:43.750
putting it together to give when it wasn't working,

384
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.150
you've tarnished Apple's reputation.

385
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.390
You should hate each other for having let each other down.

386
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.720
So,
okay,
so first of all,
let's look at the factory.

387
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.890
You've heard me say this before,

388
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.640
that people's strengths are their weaknesses and their weaknesses can be their

389
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:05.140
strengths.
So in Steve Job's case,
obviously some of this stuff,

390
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.900
some of his weaknesses that we're talking about here,

391
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:10.570
we're also a strength because he was totally beyond driven,
right?

392
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.850
He was completely obsessed with,
with doing good and all that.
And,

393
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.180
and he pressed toward his vision extremely hard.

394
00:23:19.181 --> 00:23:22.720
He was relentless in trying to make things happen.
And again,

395
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:24.430
those are very positive characteristics.

396
00:23:24.431 --> 00:23:25.680
If you've got someone that's really driven,

397
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.230
they're driven to the point of almost being obsessed.
And you,

398
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.800
you take that and those are kind of good characteristics,

399
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.050
but when they go too far,
this is why it's dichotomy.

400
00:23:36.051 --> 00:23:38.310
This is the balance of leadership,
right?
When when you go too far,

401
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.980
you become a tyrannical leader,
which is not good.
It's not good for a team.

402
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:42.660
And it's,

403
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:47.660
and a team that is subjected to that of attitude will not perform as well as a

404
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:51.770
unified team,
period.
Period.

405
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:58.270
So the guy was clearly hostile and at the same time,

406
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.770
clear,
clearly he was one of the most successful business leaders in history,

407
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.940
right?
So
would you look at them and say,
okay,

408
00:24:07.941 --> 00:24:10.640
well maybe I should be that way.
Maybe I should be a tyrannical leader.

409
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.860
And I would say to that,
no,
you do not get to do that.

410
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:20.810
And here's why.
Let's look at some other characteristics that Steve jobs had.

411
00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:23.291
First of all,

412
00:24:23.291 --> 00:24:28.291
he was perhaps the four most technological visionary in the history of the

413
00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:31.840
world.
I mean,

414
00:24:31.841 --> 00:24:36.841
he had a vision of technology that very few people in the history and the world

415
00:24:37.871 --> 00:24:40.360
of hat and I will go a little bit more narrow.

416
00:24:40.361 --> 00:24:42.640
I think he understood things on a note,

417
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.700
another level when it came to technology that the part of how human beings would

418
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.140
interact with technology.

419
00:24:50.141 --> 00:24:54.220
That's the part that I think he really had just incredible vision for.

420
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.510
He realized like,
Oh,

421
00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.620
these people will want a computer in their house and they'll want it to reflect

422
00:24:59.621 --> 00:25:03.160
the way they live and they're going to want music in their pocket.

423
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.380
They're going to want all of their music in their pocket and they're going to

424
00:25:05.381 --> 00:25:07.540
want a phone that can do,
you know,

425
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.770
he had this vision of how people would interact with technology that I don't

426
00:25:11.771 --> 00:25:16.450
think too many people have.
So,
so that's number one.
Number two,

427
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:21.670
he had a phenomenal feel for design,
right?

428
00:25:21.671 --> 00:25:26.170
For Design and how to merge form and function together in,

429
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.290
in an in an ass,
theoretically pleasing and,
and oftentimes stunning way,

430
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.960
right?
If you look at the design,
and that's uncommon,

431
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.550
especially for someone to have that field for design and still have a massively

432
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:44.900
technical background,
right?
So,
so that again,
we're poor.
We're,

433
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.960
we're making a person that's like 1% of 1% of 1% already on top of that,

434
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:55.180
he got into business his business at the right time in the right place.

435
00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.360
He had the right background on top of that.

436
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.000
The guy could speak well.
The guy was very articulate,
right?

437
00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:05.980
He was very articulate with this vision.
If you,

438
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.750
if you watch his keynote speeches that he would give at the whatever it is,

439
00:26:10.751 --> 00:26:13.210
when they have the apple convention,
what's that thing called?

440
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.790
The apple convinced they have that thing.

441
00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:19.360
Well he'd get up on stage and he'd talk about stuff and he would articulate that

442
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.730
and he would do it with real clarity and he was very convincing and he was very

443
00:26:24.731 --> 00:26:29.060
captivating and people were,
you know,
they'd say Apple's a cult,
eh,

444
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.100
they'd follow that guy.

445
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.570
So he had all those skills,

446
00:26:34.571 --> 00:26:37.210
those world class skills and I'm not using that term lightly.

447
00:26:37.211 --> 00:26:41.250
I'm talking world class skills.
And then they're,

448
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:46.140
all those world class skills are together into one package,
one human being.

449
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.370
And there you got,
you got Steve Jobs.
So he's got all those advantages.

450
00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:53.850
And then on top of that,
he's had some luck along the way,
right?

451
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.330
You had some luck in his timing and his upbringing and,

452
00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.370
and the exposures that he got and being exposed to computer programming and

453
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.120
those things back in the day was rare and he got lucky and having that unfold

454
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:08.730
form.

455
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:13.730
So we had all these things going for him that helped propel him and his company

456
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:16.554
to the top.

457
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.600
So now if you're thinking maybe you should use his leadership style,

458
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.290
the,
the,
the questions that you should ask yourself is,

459
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:30.000
are you all one in a billion vit,
technological visionary,

460
00:27:30.001 --> 00:27:34.820
a visionary of any kind?
The answer to that is likely know.

461
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.780
And if you think it's yes,
maybe you should check your ego a little bit,

462
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.130
then you have to ask yourself,
do you have an eye for design,

463
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:48.710
an artistic eye for design?
Like,
like Da Vinci or Michelangelo?

464
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.870
If you have that,
you,
you,
you probably don't.
If you think you have that,

465
00:27:53.871 --> 00:27:55.610
maybe you should check your ego again.

466
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Are you a gifted speaker and storyteller and can you convey your vision with

467
00:28:01.701 --> 00:28:06.050
total clarity to big giant groups,
broad groups of people?

468
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.400
And if you think you can do that,
again,
you should check your ego.

469
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.820
Can you count on luck or do you want to count on luck to,

470
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:20.490
to close the gaps in some of those other areas.

471
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.700
So if you could do all those things,

472
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:27.600
if you answered yes a hundred percent to all those questions,
then okay,

473
00:28:27.601 --> 00:28:32.601
maybe you can get away with being a kind of leader that Steve jobs was.

474
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.510
But if you're a normal person,
if you're a normal human being,

475
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.170
then maybe you should try and be a good leader

476
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.520
and maybe you should be a leader that builds relationships in forms,

477
00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:49.290
cohesive teams and coalitions that help you drive your mission forward despite

478
00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:52.770
the ups and downs of whatever business you're in.

479
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.180
So
that's it.

480
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.160
Steve Jobs had a lot of other things that made him successful.

481
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:07.590
Yeah.
And leadership and,
and he,
I'm going to eventually read the book,

482
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:11.130
but he clearly had some people around him that,

483
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.710
that utilized that skill.

484
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.210
The skills that he did had it have and move,
help move them forward.
Right.

485
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.960
Other people at the company,
other people early in in apple saw that,
hey,

486
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:27.270
you know what,
this guy,
he might be a little bit hard to deal with,

487
00:29:27.271 --> 00:29:29.610
but he's got some things that we won't find anywhere else,

488
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.680
so let's prop him up and let's move forward.

489
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.860
And that's the way it works.

490
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.560
I think they call that survivorship bias where you're like,
you see,
oh,

491
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:41.840
you see a successful guy and he,
oh

492
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:46.390
<v 1>yeah,
he did it that way,
so let's do it that way.
Um,
but yeah,
you,</v>

493
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.530
you kind of don't see all the other factors or whatever.
Almost like you,

494
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.950
if you really think about it,

495
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.880
if Steve jobs were to be like in these tyrannical ways of what if he were to be

496
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:57.610
less like that,
maybe there would be more successful,
you see what I'm saying?

497
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:01.150
But he was so strong in these other areas that it Kinda like mitigated the

498
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:01.660
effects.

499
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.550
<v 0>You know,
there's,</v>

500
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.030
there's businesses that are successful because they're a successful business

501
00:30:06.031 --> 00:30:09.630
model and in the,
he have really bad leadership.
Yeah.
And even that count,

502
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.080
there's still even the bad leadership,
doesn't it?
It's the,
the,

503
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.670
the model is so good.
Yeah.
Which is a little bit contrary because,
you know,

504
00:30:17.671 --> 00:30:19.620
I would say leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield.

505
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.100
But in the business world,
if you have a phenomenal idea,

506
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.510
then you can,
you can be successful on that idea alone.
Now that is,

507
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:28.560
that is a unicorn.

508
00:30:28.561 --> 00:30:30.870
That is one of those rare things where you have something that's,

509
00:30:30.871 --> 00:30:35.871
that incredibly different and stands out from the crowd so much that it's going

510
00:30:36.811 --> 00:30:39.980
to be successful no matter what.
And you know,
when the,
uh,

511
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.490
when the early gyms,
MMA type gyms,

512
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.870
if you had one,
you are successful.

513
00:30:45.871 --> 00:30:47.910
It didn't matter what kind of leader you are because you had,

514
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.450
you had it and now there's competition.
And if you're not,

515
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.910
if you don't have good leadership and you're not putting forth a good product

516
00:30:53.911 --> 00:30:55.680
amongst all the competitors,
you're gonna have problems.

517
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.330
You're going to have problems with it.

518
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.780
<v 1>Yeah.
And the more I kind of listened to you in life,</v>

519
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.550
the more I realized that even then the like,

520
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.300
it's almost like you have to have a minimum level of leadership.

521
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:09.961
Like you don't be,

522
00:31:09.961 --> 00:31:12.960
you have to be perfect if you have the one of these situations where the product

523
00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:16.530
of the business model is so good,
but still,
even your leadership can mess that.

524
00:31:16.531 --> 00:31:19.760
Oh yeah,
you can.
Absolutely.
Because yeah,

525
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.120
like you're in a situation where he'd be like,

526
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:24.540
[inaudible] no one wants to work for you.
Now what?
Oh yeah,
good,
nice.
Mma Gym.

527
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.770
You don't have any,
you got to work there the whole time and you can't,
you know,

528
00:31:28.771 --> 00:31:30.900
so it's going to kind of fall apart after a while.

529
00:31:30.901 --> 00:31:32.790
So maybe like in the beginning it'd be good,

530
00:31:32.791 --> 00:31:34.870
but it will fall apart because of your,
of,

531
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.750
<v 0>for sure.
And you can see that,
I mean,</v>

532
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.010
who's the guy that just got removed from Uber?
I'd have to go into,

533
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.360
I'd have to really drill down on it,

534
00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:49.361
but the CEO of Uber got removed and you know,

535
00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.380
the business model's awesome.
Yeah.

536
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.840
And they still remove the CEO.
Why?
Because there's,

537
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.390
there's issues there,
eh,
and so,

538
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.830
well it's a great business model but we still need good leadership.
Yeah.
So yeah,

539
00:32:03.831 --> 00:32:06.650
like,
like I'm,
I'm basically confirming what you just said,

540
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.950
the good business model,
we'll get you to a certain level,

541
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.010
but then to get to the next level you're going to need leadership.

542
00:32:13.011 --> 00:32:16.920
And that's why leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield,
man.

543
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.330
So what the moral,
don't necessarily be tie radical.
No,

544
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.290
in fact,
don't be straight up to radical.
Don't be,

545
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.100
and I'm not saying that there's not times where you have to have a little

546
00:32:31.101 --> 00:32:34.790
tyrannical flair cause there,
there may be times where you need to,

547
00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:39.710
where you need to flare up a little bit,
but it should be rare.
Yeah.

548
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.551
It should be rare.

549
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:43.130
The problem is it becomes a crutch for people and then they just continue to do

550
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:46.730
it more and more and more and more.
And then it doesn't work.
It's like,

551
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.740
it's Kinda like drugs to the like when you like when you flare up on someone
and,

552
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:55.490
and you win or whatever,
you know,
you of like it worked.
Yeah,
it worked.

553
00:32:55.491 --> 00:32:59.840
And you kind of lay,
it feels good.
It feels powerful.
Hmm.
So I think some people,

554
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.830
that's how you know,
so they'll do it in an a work and there'll be like,
yeah,

555
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:07.790
I will need that little,
and what's even worse is when you win,
that's where you,

556
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.140
you learn from someone,

557
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.890
that's what you saw and then the you do it and you go off and work for me too.

558
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:17.690
And all I have to be is treat people bad and be a jerk and yell.
And the,

559
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.100
my subordinates will do what I tell them to do and they will write a subordinate

560
00:33:22.101 --> 00:33:24.170
will,
if you bark at him and scream at them,

561
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:25.790
they're going to do what you say at the moment.

562
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.720
The problem is what kind of team of the belt.
That's the problem.
Yeah.

563
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.910
What does that subordinate going to do when you're not there?

564
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.010
You're going to do everything they can to cut corners and,

565
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.040
and really they don't care about,
they don't care about you.

566
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.530
They don't know want to do good job for you.
And so when you're not there,

567
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:40.760
they're not going to do a good job for you.

568
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:43.550
So you get addicted to yelling and screaming,

569
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:48.020
but it doesn't work in the broad sense of what you're trying to make happen

570
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:52.220
slowly falling apart.
That's the question.

571
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.210
I'm 26 years old.
I'm currently an undercover detective.

572
00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.070
I've recently been told that I'm being promoted to sergeant over our
departments,

573
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.320
investigations division.

574
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.980
I've been the youngest person to hold that position in our department's history.

575
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.860
All the guys I'll be in charge in of our much older,
some in their late forties.

576
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:14.990
How do I as a younger leader lead them?

577
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.280
How do you demand and earn respect from an older group?

578
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.160
I'm ready for the job and know what the job entails,

579
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:26.810
but I'm nervous to lead a group of nine people that are all older than me.

580
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.823
So,
um,

581
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:32.150
I've answered this question over and over again and I'm going to do a quick job

582
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:37.151
of it here just because people may not have gone back and listened to all the

583
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.730
other podcasts,
but you have listened to,
the answer's always the same.

584
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:45.050
And it's always the same whether you're a young person leading old person,

585
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.420
whether you're an old person leading young per people,

586
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.900
whether you're a woman leading men,
a men leading man,
leading women,

587
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.980
whether you're coming in from a different department into a new department that

588
00:34:54.981 --> 00:34:55.761
you don't know anybody,

589
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:57.710
whether you're going into a thing that you don't have experience,

590
00:34:57.711 --> 00:35:00.290
it's like all the same.
Basically what it is,

591
00:35:00.291 --> 00:35:05.060
you're going into a leadership position.
That's what it is.
Be Humble.
Listen,

592
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:09.380
take advice,
build relationships,
keep your ego in check.
Also,

593
00:35:09.381 --> 00:35:12.020
the one of the reasons I pulled the,
did pull this question I was,
he's like,

594
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.820
how do you demand respect will?
The answer is you don't demand respect.

595
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.730
And if you don't,
if you do demand respect,

596
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.510
you'll get anything but respect from people.
So,

597
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.830
so get that out of your head.
You earn respect.
And how do you earn respect?

598
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:31.820
You respect them.
In this case,
you respect their experience,

599
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.640
you respect their knowledge,
you respect it,

600
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.680
they've been doing it for a long time.
You have respect for it,

601
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.610
and when you show respect for them,
they're going to respect you back.
Now,

602
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.230
none of this means be passive,
right?

603
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.580
This doesn't mean cower down.
No,
you still have to lead.

604
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.450
You still have to step up.
But it does mean be humble,
be open minded,

605
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:58.620
be proactive,
listen,
ask questions,
ask for opinions,

606
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.400
decentralize all aspects of operations including the planning,

607
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:09.030
which we already talked about.
And then with all of those things,

608
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:14.010
set a high standard and then the final and most important,

609
00:36:14.011 --> 00:36:16.710
well,
I dunno,
it's equally important.
I'd say

610
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.200
work harder than everyone else and expect nothing in return.

611
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.900
That's it.
That's it.
You're the boss.
You better be,

612
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.460
you better be at work before everyone and you better be leaving work after

613
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:33.294
everyone.

614
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:37.680
And that's how you develop a reputation of being a hard worker and being a hard

615
00:36:37.681 --> 00:36:42.480
worker in its own right garners respect from most people.
There's,

616
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.910
there's a a fraction of losers that are like,
oh echo,
he works so much.

617
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.580
It's so lame.
Like no,
like cause I'm making them look bad or something like that.

618
00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.780
Yeah he is.
He's just,
he's,
yeah,

619
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.530
there's a small fraction of people that that might think that way but,
but no,

620
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:03.120
you work hard.
You put in the time,
you put in the effort you study,

621
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.010
you read,
which you're supposed to read.

622
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:07.080
You get the professional knowledge that you're supposed to get.

623
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:11.430
You don't impose that on people but you have it cause your,

624
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.010
your book knowledge when you start off in this situation,

625
00:37:14.011 --> 00:37:17.250
your book knowledge isn't as strong as the experience guides in this case.

626
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:20.490
You know in the,
in the law enforcement,
the guys that have been in the streets,

627
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:22.740
they know stuff that you don't know.
Yeah.

628
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:28.220
So you study what you can but you keep an open mind so you can listen to what

629
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.230
their experience says.
Yeah.

630
00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.360
Like I don't impose on them.
When you say don't impose it on them,

631
00:37:36.361 --> 00:37:40.440
does that mean don't impose them?
Like make them dress them echo.

632
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.770
Section four two alpha of the documents says that we're supposed to use this

633
00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:49.200
methodology.
When we do this,
you should know that methodology.

634
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:52.740
You should understand why that methodology is important,
but if you say,

635
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:55.190
Hey Jocko,
we don't do it that way and here's why I shouldn't be locked up.

636
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.850
I'm telling you it's by the book.

637
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:01.080
Buy The book now if it's by the book because it's,
there's an ethical reason.

638
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.750
Okay,
well that makes sense,
but if it's by the book,

639
00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:08.110
because that's what the book says by the mock.
Yeah,

640
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.400
yeah.
Or you know the guy who's like,
who works extra hard,

641
00:38:11.401 --> 00:38:13.740
but he kind of in a way throws it in everyone's face.

642
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:16.500
How hard you going to be that guy?
That's,
that's an important thing.

643
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:17.880
It's a very important piece.
Don't you?

644
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:21.930
Don't step on people's toes with this stuff that's wrong.
Don't do that.

645
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.670
Check.
It's squish.
Jocko,

646
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.630
I'm extremely,

647
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:35.040
extremely driven and have high expectations for myself and my team.

648
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.870
It appears that now I may have pushed them too hard

649
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.130
and they're developing negative attitudes.

650
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.110
I feel like you're going to say play the game and develop relationships with

651
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:50.560
them,
but should are really just ignore who I am.

652
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.690
Should I try to be someone different than myself?

653
00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:02.290
Yeah.
Well you called it question person.
Whoever asked this question,

654
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.710
you called it I,
that's exactly what I'm going to say.

655
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:07.030
I'm going to say you need to play the game.

656
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.830
Look at what your current path has done.
Look at what you,

657
00:39:11.831 --> 00:39:14.870
the real you,
look what it's done and real you has,

658
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.880
has created a negative attitude with all your team.
That's the real you.

659
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.630
So is that what you want to perpetuate?

660
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.170
Creating negative attitudes against your,
with your team.
And by the way,

661
00:39:26.171 --> 00:39:28.360
they're just getting started and if you think negative,

662
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.430
if you think you're going to keep acting the same way in the negative,

663
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:32.590
attitudes are going to somehow miraculously turned positive.

664
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.030
That's not happening.
They're going to get more negative.
Yeah.

665
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.940
So
when people have negative attitudes,

666
00:39:40.941 --> 00:39:43.870
and I saw somebody quoted this the other day on,
on social media,
on Twitter,

667
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.250
someone would,
you know the quote was like,
no,
no,
no,

668
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:50.260
it's not my fault.
When Nice,

669
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.530
my subordinates have a bad attitude or something like that,

670
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.040
and about a bunch of people responded like you should read the book extreme

671
00:39:57.041 --> 00:40:00.730
ownership because it absolutely is your fault.
It is your fault.

672
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.090
If your team has a bad attitude,
it's your fault.
You're the leader.

673
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.000
You own the attitude.
If their attitude is bad,
then it's,

674
00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.740
then it's actually your fault.
Now,

675
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:11.410
this is not to say that you can't have a bad apple on the team.

676
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:12.730
That's completely possible.

677
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.970
And who's responsible for getting rid of the bad apples?
You are.

678
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.710
You're the boss because the fact of the matter is you might have a bad apple on

679
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:22.960
your team.
You might even have two bad apples on your team.

680
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:27.420
You don't have 14 bad apples on the team.
When you have 14 battles,

681
00:40:27.421 --> 00:40:29.830
the apples on the team,
guess who the problem is?
It's you.

682
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.900
So here's what you do.
A little,

683
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.480
little tactical advice.

684
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.090
Try and get some perspective from them,

685
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:43.720
trying to understand where they're coming from,
what challenges they face,

686
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.890
what's pulling them off track.
And when you do this,

687
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:51.940
you kind of take ownership of it in your approach.
So you said,
hey guys,
I,

688
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.740
I realize I don't think I'm really seeing things from your point of view and I

689
00:40:56.741 --> 00:41:01.630
need to because I'm here to support you and without you performing well,

690
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:05.530
then we fail.
So I think I need to do a better job of supporting you.

691
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:07.990
And I can only do that if I know what your issues are.

692
00:41:07.991 --> 00:41:12.700
So I can do my best to get them fixed.
So what can I do better to help you?

693
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.390
All right?
So now they're going to start telling you all,
here's why.
Here's one.

694
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.720
There's this problem,
there's that problem.

695
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:20.020
And then what you do is you listen to their problems.

696
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:25.450
You're actually listened to problems.
You don't say,
Ooh,
group complaining.
No,

697
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:29.740
you actually listened to their problems and then you actually see what you can

698
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:34.460
do to mitigate their issues.
And as you do that,
guess what's happening?

699
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.020
You're actually forming a bond.

700
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:42.190
You're actually forming into a team because you're working together to solve

701
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:47.360
issues.
Again,
I,
it sounds really simple,
right?

702
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.970
But clearly,
here's someone asking this question.
Now again,

703
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:54.230
like if you have some members of the team that are,

704
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:59.120
that are actual negative,
complaining whiners,

705
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.770
then you might have to get rid of him.
And,

706
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.600
and that's part of being a leader is knowing when you have to get rid of
someone.

707
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.520
You,
you know,
sometimes people,

708
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:14.570
they take the extreme ownership attitude and they say,
you know what,

709
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.040
I'm the leader.
I own everything.
I'm extreme ownership.

710
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.570
And if someone's not performing well,
then that's my fault.
That's my fault.

711
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.760
I need to coach them or I need to,
I need to do,

712
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:29.270
it's my fault that my team member is not doing well.
And that's correct.

713
00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:32.900
It is your fault.
It's your responsibility to train them,
coach them,
mentor them,

714
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:36.290
and do whatever else you can do to fix them.
But at the end of the day,

715
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:41.291
if they still are not competent at their task and you've done everything you

716
00:42:42.021 --> 00:42:44.900
can,
it's your responsible to get rid of them.

717
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:49.190
That is also a part of ownership.
So

718
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.810
yeah,
like I'll have someone complaining that they've got all this,
you know,

719
00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:54.830
one of my team leaders,

720
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.620
like they're talking about their subordinate teen leaders and the Luma warm I

721
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:01.460
this,
this guy's,
he's just a bad leader.
Why is he still here?

722
00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.300
They owe your team.
That team isn't doing well because they have a bad leader.

723
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:08.090
Who's fault is that?
If the leader's fault?
No,
it's your fault.

724
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:10.940
You're in charge of the leader is the ridiculous.

725
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.230
So back to the original question,

726
00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.830
you're a,
whatever you called it,

727
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.100
your who you actually are is not working well,

728
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.600
he probably is thinking he's a Steve jobs type a Tacoma.
We've got to do this,

729
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.200
but it's not working and he's not in a unicorn business model that's still

730
00:43:32.361 --> 00:43:35.630
making a ton of money regardless.
So what does he have to do?

731
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.090
Play the game and build the relationships,

732
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:44.620
see the perspective of your team so that you can actually form a team.

733
00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:50.540
Would you be a better leader?
That's basically what I'm saying.
Yeah.

734
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:55.070
So the,
in the,
it's interesting the,

735
00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.010
what they call framing,
you know,
you frame something,

736
00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:00.800
something in a certain way to make it kind of sound a certain way,
whatever.

737
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.510
So he said extremely driven and have high expectations for myself and my team,

738
00:44:05.511 --> 00:44:10.511
it appears that now I may have pushed them too hard and they're developing

739
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.700
negative attitudes.
So having extreme,

740
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.760
being extremely driven and having high expectations doesn't equal equal driving

741
00:44:19.511 --> 00:44:22.490
him too hard.
So they develop that negative outlook.
Those are two different,

742
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.360
you know,
you can still be extreme.
So yeah,

743
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:30.620
you can absolutely have extremely high expectations and you can be driving

744
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.130
extremely hard

745
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.730
<v 2>and you can still have incredibly positive attitude with your team.
Yeah,</v>

746
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.820
no doubt.
Yeah,
good point.
It's so,

747
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.800
and then it gets equated into that's just who I am.
So the,

748
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:46.230
he just kind of put it all into one ball and without one,

749
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.230
there's no other kind of situation.
It's just not how it is.

750
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.470
So apparently you might be committed,

751
00:44:52.471 --> 00:44:56.820
he might be committed to being all of these things and that's who I am and

752
00:44:56.821 --> 00:44:58.530
that's kind of it,
you know,
kind of thing.

753
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:01.340
And I think that's like the mistake plenty of people make,

754
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.960
we say this a lot where people will be like,
Hey,
I'm just straight forward,

755
00:45:03.961 --> 00:45:06.630
you know,
take me take it or leave it kind of thing and be like,
okay,

756
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:10.110
but you're going to in your case lose,
you know,
in your,
in your situation.

757
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:14.970
That's the big piece is that in their case they're going to lose.

758
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.850
Yeah.
So let me ask you this question.

759
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.360
If you're so driven and you have such high expectations that you want to win so

760
00:45:24.991 --> 00:45:25.824
bad,

761
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.060
but the way you're performing as a human being and as a leader is going to make

762
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:34.820
you lose,
then what are you supposed to do?
You change the way you behave,
change.

763
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:39.000
You'd be a better leader.
Yeah.
That's what you do.

764
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:41.280
Yes sir.
So you take,

765
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.910
and this is total speculation on my part,

766
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.940
but you keep kids.

767
00:45:46.941 --> 00:45:50.850
So this equation that we're presented with x being extremely driven,

768
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:55.110
keep that high expectations,
keep that pushing your team hard and keep that,

769
00:45:55.111 --> 00:45:56.160
I would say to harden,

770
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.400
that's going to be a judgment call from day to day for sure.
Um,

771
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.430
but there's a part in here that's more implied that you're being an asshole

772
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.520
somewhere in here.
You're being an asshole.
How about do you take out that part?

773
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.790
Take out the bean,
the asshole part,
and then keep everything else.

774
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.180
We'll see how that goes.
Yeah.
Cause you kind of know when you're being a dick.

775
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.433
You know what I'm saying?

776
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.040
Unless you're like not being honest with yourself there.

777
00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.540
There's some people that don't,
there's some still don't get it.

778
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.770
There's some people that don't get it all right because it's like,

779
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:24.210
you know how like when you don't,

780
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:28.280
like some people they just can't step outside of themselves and be like,
Hey,

781
00:46:28.281 --> 00:46:32.340
if you said that to me,
I wouldn't care kind of thing and be like,
Bro,
Bruh,

782
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.400
you know,
you're not me and I'm not.
You kind of.
Yeah,
you're right.

783
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:39.750
They kept attach.
Yes.
Absolutely.
People that,
that don't know,

784
00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.250
they're socially

785
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:47.850
incapable of receiving clues,
social clues,

786
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.000
people,
social cues from people,
you know,

787
00:46:51.001 --> 00:46:54.600
they don't see the look in their face when they are talking to him.
Yeah,

788
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:57.540
that's true.
I mean,
I'm thinking of like three examples for sure.

789
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:01.950
Yeah.
Also that then that would go back to what you're saying,

790
00:47:01.951 --> 00:47:06.120
how you said get input from them.
So you gotta kind of,
yeah,
so you,
yeah,

791
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:07.810
you can do it,
but it's a solvable problem.

792
00:47:07.811 --> 00:47:12.700
So he was a very solvable problem and I've seen people solve this problem.
I've,

793
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.170
I've helped people solve this exact problem.

794
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.300
And the weird thing is they think,
and it's part of ego,

795
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:25.740
but it's also park there,
just the 1% they think they're doing a great thing.

796
00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:30.880
Like they think that they're driving everything that they're doing in their

797
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:34.990
mind.
They're just awesome for being super pushing so hard.

798
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:39.520
It's just the way I am and all that stuff and they think it's awesome.
But again,

799
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:44.100
if you want to win so bad,
then you have to play the game.

800
00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:49.140
You won't win by abusing people.
You won't win with a team anyways.

801
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.350
You won't.
It won't happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.

802
00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:58.680
It's no use being the best dancer.
If you're not invited on the dance floor,

803
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:04.750
one of them.
I'll leave that one with you.
Yay.
All right,

804
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:09.360
cool.
Next question.
Actually that problem is so solvable that you could,

805
00:48:09.361 --> 00:48:13.800
this is possible where you could just show just that much.
Um,

806
00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.230
like more,
I don't know,
caring or respect.

807
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.750
Just that much respect and due for like two weeks.
Yeah.

808
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.410
Just the idea that just the fact that you're doing it now,
people would be like,

809
00:48:22.411 --> 00:48:24.990
hey wait,
he's showing a little bit.
Here's this thing.
Here's the thing.

810
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.310
If a person has an ego,

811
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.380
which this person could very well have a big ego because that's why they have

812
00:48:31.381 --> 00:48:35.130
these high expectations and that's why they are so driven because they just the,

813
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.040
if they have that kind of ego,
that's the person that you can't help.

814
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.040
Because if they just look at the team and say,

815
00:48:41.041 --> 00:48:43.350
those guys should be harder workers.
Yeah.

816
00:48:43.351 --> 00:48:46.740
Those guys aren't working as hard as me.
They're not as focused as I am.

817
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.850
They don't care as much as I do.
So,

818
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:54.410
so everyone else on the team has a problem.
Yeah.

819
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.770
But I'm perfect and you can't,
you,
you know,

820
00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.210
look at how driven I am looking at how focused I am,

821
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:04.530
look at how high my expectations are of myself.
But if,
if you can,

822
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.340
here's another thing.
If your team cannot relate to your expectations,

823
00:49:08.341 --> 00:49:09.174
like they don't even,

824
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.030
they don't even see him as realistic or achievable or anything,

825
00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.810
we'll go what could or your expectations.
Yeah.
Well good.
Are they,

826
00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:20.940
they're not any good.
No good.
They don't make any sense.
That's true.

827
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.150
Next question.
Dear Jocko,

828
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.480
I've been watching some of your youtube links with great interests.

829
00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:33.300
Must be a subscriber to the youtube channel
videos.

830
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.590
I'm sure you're extremely busy,
but I have a question.

831
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:38.740
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

832
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.020
<v 2>Which if you have time,
I would greatly appreciate your reply.</v>

833
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:45.310
I've taken light opening by the way.
Very much so.
Can I,

834
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.290
let me incorporate that approach as well.

835
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.200
I've taken up Bjj,
Jujitsu recently in London,

836
00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.680
in the UK,
so a,
so a beginner.

837
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.040
I know you're a great advocate of the system,
but my basic question is,

838
00:50:02.041 --> 00:50:06.750
your opinion,
does it truly relate to real life fight situations?

839
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:11.040
I'm a man now approaching my mid forties in pretty good shape and I'm looking to

840
00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:15.660
focus on a martial art that would help me if I ever need to defend myself or my

841
00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:20.010
family.
I love the discipline and humility of Bjj and as a workout,

842
00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.173
I know,

843
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.650
and I know the philosophy of Bjj is that most fights end up on the ground and

844
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.950
it's here that Bjj

845
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.843
<v 0>excels.</v>

846
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:33.910
But what of the other guys or what of the other guys who might be standing

847
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:39.710
around ready to battle bottle you or kick you in the head once you're grappling

848
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.540
on the ground,
et cetera.
Again,
this is a question that,
first of all,

849
00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:50.130
I mentioned this a lot of times.
Sure.
About,
I'll answer one more time.
Uh,

850
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.030
do you just use the best place to start?
You should also learn boxing,

851
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.060
wrestling and kickboxing.
This is all in discipline equals freedom field manual.

852
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:03.920
So if you get that book,
He,
this'll be laid out for you.
Very well.
Does so,

853
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.720
so yes,
that's what you should start studying with this guy.
Mid Forties.

854
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.630
Needs,
wants to learn something.
Yes.
Start with Jujitsu.

855
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.730
Does it relate to relate real life situations?
Yes,
it does.

856
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.920
It absolutely does.
I've been in them.

857
00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:24.310
It's extremely effective and you can see that over and over again.

858
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.810
Speaking of Youtube,
you can see how effective Jujitsu is in real fights.

859
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:30.943
Now

860
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.630
it's important to remember that for self defense,

861
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:40.631
the grappling arts in general should be used primarily to get away it to avoid

862
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:44.780
going to the ground.
Right?
Like when you bring up,

863
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:48.200
oh well what if there's other people that might be there?
You should.

864
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:50.900
Why are you on the ground Jujitsu?

865
00:51:50.901 --> 00:51:54.050
We'll give you the best opportunity to get up off the ground.

866
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.000
That's what it gives you.

867
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.880
And then you can get away from the people that are getting ready to stick you

868
00:51:58.881 --> 00:52:01.700
with a bottle smashed bottle or getting ready to kick you in the head.

869
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.620
If you don't know Jujitsu,
guess what you're doing.

870
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.840
You're on the ground and you're getting kicked in the head and you're getting

871
00:52:05.841 --> 00:52:07.050
stabbed with a bottle.
Yeah.

872
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.460
That's why you train Jujitsu so you can get up off the ground,

873
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:13.610
not so you can take someone to the ground.
Because by the way,

874
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:14.810
and I've said this before,

875
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:19.050
if your goal is to punch me and you're standing at a punching distance or

876
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.310
striking distance from me,
I can just run away.
That's my self defense.

877
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.900
I can get away from you.

878
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.940
So that's why we train Jujitsu.

879
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:31.460
That that's the primary.

880
00:52:31.461 --> 00:52:35.450
That's why you should start with it because otherwise I'm just going to get away

881
00:52:35.451 --> 00:52:37.880
from you if you're not grat.
If once you grabbed me though,

882
00:52:37.881 --> 00:52:42.530
I can't get away from you anymore.
Now I have to be able to to handle myself.

883
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.550
That's why I know you did too.
So I can handle myself once you've grabbed me.

884
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.361
If you're not grabbing me,

885
00:52:47.361 --> 00:52:48.800
I can just get away from it cause it run away from you.

886
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:53.510
If you don't want to run away because it's going to hurt your pride.

887
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:58.010
Well then guess what?
That's that's why you train all the time.
I mean now,

888
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.330
now we go back and forth and we can talk about all the negative things that will

889
00:53:01.331 --> 00:53:03.710
happen if you get into a street fight,
like the fact that you can get hurt,

890
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:06.860
you can get stabbed,
you can get shot and you can get sued,
you can get arrested,

891
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:07.940
you can ruin your life,

892
00:53:07.941 --> 00:53:11.390
you can do all these horrible things can happen if you get in a street fight.
So,

893
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.630
so,
so that's why my advice to you is to avoid street fights.
Yeah.

894
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:17.720
That's what you do.
And by the way,
that's why you work on your awareness.

895
00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.430
That's why you make your,
your,
your,

896
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.570
your wife and your children aware of what's going on around them to pay

897
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:25.190
attention to what's happening in the street.

898
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.200
It's one thing that was interesting when I was in Australia and I was in a nice

899
00:53:28.201 --> 00:53:33.160
part of Australia.
There's Alice talking to some people about it,
you know,

900
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:37.200
there's just a very relaxed atmosphere where I was,

901
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:40.320
I was standing in a very nice part of Australia.

902
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:45.740
There's a very relaxed atmosphere where when you're in America,

903
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:50.520
there is a heightened atmosphere,
does a heightened awareness you have to have.

904
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:53.100
And depending on where you are,
and it's the same thing I'm sure in Australia,

905
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:55.380
I don't know,
I'll do,
went to the nice part.
I'm sure you could go to some,

906
00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.440
some tough areas where you better be more aware of what's happening but teach

907
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:02.790
your kids because some kids don't know the difference.

908
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.910
Maybe you don't even know the difference of what to look out for.

909
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.970
What kind of people you need to watch out for in the street.

910
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.500
So work on that and then yes,
train.

911
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:17.940
And you're in the UK and,
and of course I've said this before,

912
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.890
if you are truly in a situation where you feel threatened on a regular basis,

913
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:25.140
well then what you need is a firearm.

914
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:30.500
Because if someone's going to attack you with a knife or with a bottle or with

915
00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:33.330
themselves having a gun,
the only Jujitsu isn't gonna help you.

916
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.860
Boxing is going to help you as scream was not going to help you if someone has a

917
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:42.690
gun.
So yeah.
And,
and by the way,
oh yeah.

918
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:45.810
If you're in a knife fight and you know,
some,
a scream of that will help you,

919
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.580
but what if the other guy's better than you?
What?
What if there's two of them?

920
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.370
Yeah.
The minute you put two people against one,

921
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:58.020
the odds of winning are just extremely low,

922
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:02.550
extremely low.
Does it happen?
Yes,
it happens.
Can you knock someone out?
Yes,

923
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:06.000
you can.
That's why he trained boxing.
Yeah.
So

924
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:12.270
yes,
again,
trained some Jujitsu,
start there and go and keep going.

925
00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:13.104
And don't stop.

926
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.150
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

927
00:55:14.151 --> 00:55:17.480
It seems like this question always comes from a place where they just assume all

928
00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:18.740
these things and those things are,

929
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.340
I'm going to choose to get in a fight with someone,

930
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.350
bring it to the ground in the middle of the street or in the club on and

931
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.761
wherever,

932
00:55:25.761 --> 00:55:30.260
wherever there is potential other attackers with bottles and kicks to the head.

933
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:33.470
And so all of these things are just assumed.
Kind of like,
yeah,

934
00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:36.020
you take Jujitsu now you can go to the club and get in fights.

935
00:55:36.021 --> 00:55:37.580
And when all the time,
it's kind of like,

936
00:55:37.581 --> 00:55:41.150
that's kind of where the question's coming from,
where,
how you said,
yeah,

937
00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.890
it allows you to get up and it's,

938
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.750
so basically it allows you to control your situation,
your fight scenario more.

939
00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:48.613
Yes,

940
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.040
and I would even say it allows you a lot more to control it because even if even

941
00:55:55.311 --> 00:55:57.340
if you do take it,
let's say you take it to the ground,

942
00:55:57.341 --> 00:56:01.850
I meant more by a little bit more than nothing.
Yeah,
no.
Yeah.

943
00:56:01.851 --> 00:56:03.820
I'm seeing a lot more because really when you think of it in a,

944
00:56:03.821 --> 00:56:06.740
and I try to granted,
yeah.

945
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:10.310
Even like at a beginner level,
so let's say,
okay,

946
00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.070
if you choose to engage with somebody in some kind of fight,
right.

947
00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:21.110
It's up to you how heavy you want to take that fight.
You want to go to 10,

948
00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.010
you go to 10,
you want to go to just one,
you can go to one.
So if

949
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.210
<v 2>you wind up on the ground,</v>

950
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:29.540
which is the worst place to be if you didn't know anything on the ground.
Yeah.

951
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:31.840
And that's a site from how you said if the guy has a gun and shoots you,

952
00:56:31.841 --> 00:56:34.690
that's the day you're talking about.
That's not even a fight scenario.
That's,

953
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:39.330
you know,
um,
so you wind up in the ground.
It's a gunfight.
Gunflint yeah.

954
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:44.680
Um,
if you know boxing,

955
00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:49.160
you're going to have almost no control over that scenario for we're in the top.

956
00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:54.720
You're boxing is,
you're,
boxing is not worthless.
Marginalized.

957
00:56:54.721 --> 00:56:58.840
We'll say it's,
but it's a heavily marginalized.
Yeah.
Heavily marginalized.
Yeah.

958
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.350
Same thing with,
you know,
kickboxing and whatever.
So

959
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.120
there's that.
If you know Jujitsu,
just a little bit of Jujitsu.

960
00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.020
If you're on the ground,

961
00:57:08.021 --> 00:57:12.940
you have control over the fight more depending on your level,
whatever.
So if you,

962
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:14.260
if you're at that point,

963
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:17.410
still facing the threat of someone with a bottle or kicks to the head or

964
00:57:17.411 --> 00:57:21.280
whatever while you're on the ground compared to if you know Jujitsu versus if

965
00:57:21.281 --> 00:57:22.080
you don't know,
did you get to,

966
00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.600
you're still saving way more controlled way more so meanwhile,

967
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:27.940
like the box situation or credit situation,

968
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:31.570
whenever it's going to going to be less effective in controlling your situation.

969
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:37.300
Now if you don't look at it like that,
like if you look at it like,
okay,

970
00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:41.680
this guy's squaring up to me now,
I want to mess him up as quickly as I can,

971
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.540
then okay,
you know,

972
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:47.560
like you can do boxing and just take it to 10 but you don't have the option of

973
00:57:47.561 --> 00:57:50.800
taking it from one to three or nothing like that.
But the other thing is like,

974
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.960
it's hard to knock someone out that's,

975
00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:59.920
it's hard to knock someone out.
Does it happen?
Yeah,

976
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:04.650
it does happen and it can happen to you too.
It can happen to you too.
It's,

977
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:08.650
but it's hard to knock someone out and it's,
it's risky.

978
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:11.890
As soon as you start saying,
okay,
you and I are going to just trade punches,

979
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:14.800
there's a risk for both of us as a risk for me,

980
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:20.430
the assurance of me being able to handle the situation the way I want it to go

981
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:24.010
by closing the distance with you,
getting control,
getting ahold of you.

982
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.110
If I'm trained and you're not,
you're,
you're,
you're done.

983
00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:32.060
You're done.
Right.
That's the way it works.
Yeah.

984
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:36.130
And then even then that's like if you choose for this guy to be done,
so if your,

985
00:58:36.131 --> 00:58:38.770
if your sole purpose is to keep yourself safe,
yeah.

986
00:58:38.771 --> 00:58:40.780
You could just put the guy to sleep and walk away.
Yeah.

987
00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:44.230
Gently lay down like mount,
I'm not even hurt.
I'm not going to put them to sleep.

988
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:45.460
Nothing mount.
You see a guy,

989
00:58:45.461 --> 00:58:48.340
you can see the guy coming with a bottle or whatever.
Way More.

990
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.920
If you know Jujitsu well,

991
00:58:50.921 --> 00:58:55.921
there's the whole thing of when you're just used to the physical contact to

992
00:58:57.470 --> 00:59:02.380
the bodies clashing and grappling less shocking.

993
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:04.510
Yeah.
So yeah,

994
00:59:04.511 --> 00:59:07.420
train Jujitsu and trained boxing,

995
00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:10.090
wrestling and kickboxing and then of course now people will be like,

996
00:59:10.091 --> 00:59:14.290
what about judo?
Yes.
Trained judo.
What about Samo?
Yes.
Trane.
Samba.
Yeah.
What else?

997
00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:17.320
What else do I need to?
Cool.
What about Krav Maga?
Sure.
It's train it.

998
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:21.250
Train everything.
Yeah,
I'm down at star.

999
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:24.530
Would you do to what you said on a real general level is the most critical thing

1000
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:26.430
is like when someone gets a hold of you like,

1001
00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:29.030
and you put this into perspective a while ago when you were like,
yeah,

1002
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:33.820
if someone wants a fight you walk away or run away,
easy to buy it.

1003
00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:36.320
And he said all of these scenarios,
you run away and you go away.

1004
00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:40.650
You want to keep yourself safe.
You don't be there.
Best thing to do to avoid the,

1005
00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:45.170
the getting punched,
falling on the curb,
dying,
getting stabbed,
getting kicked,

1006
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:48.500
getting stabbed with a bottle,
getting arrested,
getting lawsuit,

1007
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:51.790
getting all those things happening.
The best thing to do.
Runaway walkaway.
Yeah.

1008
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:54.800
Leaf fully.
And then you said,

1009
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:58.350
but what happens when you can't run away?
Because this guy grabs their,

1010
00:59:58.351 --> 01:00:01.280
there you have it.
Yeah.
So yeah,
so it seems like,
yeah,

1011
01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:03.520
I'm going to train boxing so I can do self defense.
No,

1012
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:05.630
you want to fight somebody.
That's what you want to do.

1013
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:10.490
You want to punch people in the face it,
well you did too.
I mean,
yeah,
I mean,

1014
01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:14.990
but boxing is a,
is a skill that every buddy should have.

1015
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.771
Not everyone.

1016
01:00:15.771 --> 01:00:19.880
Good people should have because there's two critical things on that that you

1017
01:00:19.881 --> 01:00:21.430
learned from boxing.
How to punch people in,

1018
01:00:21.431 --> 01:00:25.190
how to avoid getting punched and how to keep your guard up right.
Fully.

1019
01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:28.580
Those are important.
Those are really important skills to have.
Yeah.
Fully.

1020
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:32.420
But what,
what I mean is if you're starting from nothing and you're like,
okay,

1021
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:36.290
I'm going to,
um,
you know,
I'm going to choose to address my self defense.

1022
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.280
You tuition,

1023
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:42.340
you have a fantasy that you saw a guy on youtube that was clearly a boxer,

1024
01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:45.380
knock a knock out,
two people in a street fight.
And you're like,

1025
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.920
that's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1026
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:51.990
That's what you actually watched was a guy that was a golden gloves boxer who is

1027
01:00:52.131 --> 01:00:55.760
sober,
knock out two drunk idiots.

1028
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.280
And guess what a golden gloves boxer will do that.

1029
01:00:58.281 --> 01:01:01.160
If you ever sparred with a golden gloves boxer,
they're freaking good.

1030
01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.080
They're freaking good.
They're,
they're,
they're,
they're uh,
you know,

1031
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:11.110
like a black belt in boxing and they will knock out two drunk guys all day long.

1032
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:18.050
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's weird too because he kind of hut if one of those,

1033
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.110
if a third drunk I or even that first drunk guy grabs a hold of the boxer yeah.

1034
01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.550
And just,
and gets him to the ground,
the boxer is going to be in trouble.

1035
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:29.660
That's the way it is.
And this isn't my thoughts.
This is facts.

1036
01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:34.580
Cause like I talked about this in discipline in the field manual is like,
look,

1037
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.440
there's no conjecture.
It's not like I wonder what would happen.

1038
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:41.600
No,
we know what happens.

1039
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:44.990
We know what happens when two people fight and,

1040
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.000
and you can watch all the different,
various types of styles going at it.

1041
01:01:50.001 --> 01:01:52.940
And you can watch what happens and sure,

1042
01:01:52.941 --> 01:01:56.060
you can find the rare video where,
hey,

1043
01:01:56.061 --> 01:02:00.110
this boxer knocks out a couple of drunk people or,
or,
or even,
hey,

1044
01:02:00.111 --> 01:02:02.570
the boxer knocks out the digital guy.
Does that happen?
Yes,

1045
01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:07.490
it can absolutely happen.
That's why you train boxing.
Do you next question.

1046
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.930
I have not been working out regularly,
regularly for several years now.

1047
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:16.730
Obviously I'm fat and lazy,
but I want to get after it.

1048
01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:20.070
So the question is should I go all in

1049
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.360
<v 0>level nine,
destruction,</v>

1050
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:26.160
maximum madness or ease into it at level three cruising.

1051
01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.750
All right,
well this,

1052
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.470
there's a couple of different approaches and then when I hear this,
first of all,

1053
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.600
you don't want to get hurt,
right?

1054
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.730
And you also don't want to make yourself try and do things that are so hard and

1055
01:02:41.731 --> 01:02:45.860
so painful that you can't do it repeatedly.
Yeah.

1056
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.500
So if you just destroy yourself,
Matt,
what do you say?
If you destroy yourself?

1057
01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:51.360
Level nine destruction,
maximum madness,

1058
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.600
but then you can't work out for two more weeks.
Well guess what?

1059
01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:58.860
What'd you do in the mean?
No,
let's say realistically you got Dom's comes.
Sure.

1060
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.350
Right.
Delayed onset muscle soreness.

1061
01:03:01.351 --> 01:03:05.250
Let's say you did so many burpees that your legs,

1062
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:09.520
you couldn't sit down without your legs being in pain.
So now,

1063
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:13.950
so you take,
so you take three days,
four days.

1064
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:17.490
Have you ever had dom so bad that you took four days off?
No.
Okay.

1065
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:21.630
Let's say you take three days off.
What did you do during those three days?

1066
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.700
Did you hold the line?
Did you stay on the path or were you eating Cheetos?

1067
01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.580
Yeah,
you're wrestling colon.
That's what you are doing.

1068
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.840
So if you destroy yourself to where you can't stay on the path,
that's not good.

1069
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.520
You want to stay on the path.

1070
01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:42.350
I think doing something that you can handle or maybe something just beyond what

1071
01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:47.040
you can handle every single day is more important.
So going at a level,
not,

1072
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:50.700
not cruising level,
not level three,
but let's,

1073
01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:54.030
let's find a solid level five where you can,
you're pushing yourself.

1074
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:58.860
I write a thousand words a day when I'm writing and let you do the equivalent of

1075
01:03:58.861 --> 01:04:01.900
that.
Right?
The reason I read,
cause if I said,
okay,
I'll do it tonight.

1076
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:06.570
I just today I just have to write 5,000 words.
That's five hours.

1077
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.660
You know,
we'll do I have five hours today.
No I don't.

1078
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:14.760
I can squeeze out 52 minutes though and get a thousand words written that I can

1079
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:18.660
do.
So that's,
that's what I think you need to do.
You need to get consistent.

1080
01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:23.110
If you bite off more than you chew than you can chew your,

1081
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:26.670
you might very well choke on it.
So Don,
so don't do that.

1082
01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:30.930
And so pick something realistic.
Do,
do people say that?

1083
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.510
That must be a same first time I heard it.

1084
01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.450
So if you bite off more than you can chew,
you might choke on it.

1085
01:04:36.451 --> 01:04:39.330
Did you make that up or you get that from somewhere?
I think I,
well I just,

1086
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.350
I don't know.
I think I made it up,
but I'm sure someone will be like,
no,

1087
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:46.020
this guy said it in 1978

1088
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.240
that is the beauty of it.
Good.
So pick something realistic,

1089
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:54.750
like for something that you can handle and then get after it.

1090
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:58.350
Then the other thing here is he doesn't talk about his diet at all.

1091
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:03.690
And that's clearly equally important and you have to change

1092
01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.560
your diet if you're going to change your life and you're going to change your

1093
01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:10.050
health.
So stop eating sugar,
stop eating processed foods,

1094
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:13.380
no more soda and juices and no more Gatorade

1095
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:20.070
just to start with or whatever it is,
whatever it is that you're doing.
Uh,

1096
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:23.110
whoever asked this question,
whatever,
you know what you're doing.

1097
01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:27.550
If you're eating donuts and don't,
don't eat donuts anymore,
stop.

1098
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:30.040
Just stop eating those.
Get rid of that sugar,

1099
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:33.280
sweetness craving thing.
Yeah.

1100
01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:38.710
And then just keep making your diet cleaner and cleaner as time goes by.
Yeah.

1101
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.830
So
that's what I think.

1102
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:45.340
Is there any time that it's good because sometimes

1103
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.570
I think it's good when people do go like,
all right man,
I'm done.

1104
01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:56.230
Like I,
whatever happened,
they went up the staircase and they,
they,

1105
01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:00.990
they got all tired and they said,
you know what?
I'm done.
Yeah,

1106
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:05.200
it starts tomorrow.
But I think in those cases,
most of the time,
who was it?

1107
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:09.110
Who was it that we were talking to?
Talking to someone,

1108
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.350
someone that they are,

1109
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:14.320
I was talking to someone that their first thing they tried to do,

1110
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:15.310
they couldn't do at all.

1111
01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:20.290
Like they tried to run three miles and they were like,
you know what?

1112
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.550
Can't do it can't run three miles.
Oh it might've been that guy.

1113
01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:28.000
There's a guy that's losing a bunch of weight on the interwebs.
Oh yeah,

1114
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:29.650
that's what it is.
I think he's down in Texas,

1115
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:34.990
but he's trying to lose a lot of weight and you first time he went and tried to

1116
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.990
go for run didn't happen.
It didn't happen.

1117
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:42.070
So he had to just run less or had to just walk actually.

1118
01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.400
So yeah,
you,

1119
01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:49.401
you start with what you can do but there is a little bit of,

1120
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:55.270
there is,
there is,
I would try,
I would say this,
keep this one in the,

1121
01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:58.600
in the back of your mind there is the whole thing of like,
you know what,

1122
01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.830
I'm changing my life right now.
You go home,
you get the garbage can out,

1123
01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:05.260
you bring it into the kitchen and you throw away the Twinkies.

1124
01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:07.860
You throw away the pop tarts,
you throw away the,
the,

1125
01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:12.640
you pour the crappy soda down the drain and you get on the path and you just

1126
01:07:12.641 --> 01:07:16.690
don't look back.
That's a good thing to do too.
But again,

1127
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.460
if that person's 300 pounds,
they're not going to be able to do,

1128
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.790
I mean,
they're going to push themselves.
Yeah.

1129
01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:28.000
They could push themselves too hard.
You just gotta be careful.
Yeah.

1130
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:31.950
<v 1>So,
and that,
it's funny when I'm,
when I'm kind of looking at the question,</v>

1131
01:07:31.951 --> 01:07:35.970
I'm like,
well obviously you want to start slow,
right?
Obviously.

1132
01:07:35.971 --> 01:07:38.550
But then I don't tell you hear about these guys,

1133
01:07:38.551 --> 01:07:41.400
just like how you said they'd just,
they throw everything away.
They were like,

1134
01:07:41.401 --> 01:07:43.910
I'm a new different person.
Right.
And I think,
I think we're,
we're,

1135
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.100
<v 0>we're crossing streams here or I am,</v>

1136
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.350
there's diet and then there's like a workout.
Yeah.

1137
01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.750
Because Diet,
you can pretty much go cold Turkey today.

1138
01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:57.300
<v 1>Yeah.
It limits and you may or may not be able to relate to this,</v>

1139
01:07:57.301 --> 01:07:59.670
but if you go straight extreme on your diet,

1140
01:07:59.671 --> 01:08:03.150
like all of a sudden you're hit with these,

1141
01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:07.020
the byproducts of changing your diet,
especially if you,
if you'd like,

1142
01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.610
like mountain dew every single day and you just,
all of a sudden boom,

1143
01:08:11.611 --> 01:08:14.880
stopped drinking month,
you'll go through stuff that you might not expect.

1144
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.160
Like the craving wait,

1145
01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:20.510
<v 2>you saw are free and minimal doses of mountain.
No.
Yeah.</v>

1146
01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:25.100
Basically I'm going to say no to stop.
He stopped drinking mountain dew.

1147
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:28.320
You don't need it.
And I dig and you're going to go through withdrawals,
right?

1148
01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:30.460
You go through caffeine withdrawals and sugar withdrawals.

1149
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.790
You're going to get the,
the,

1150
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.300
the Kido flu and all those things are gonna happen and it's going to be rough.

1151
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:37.900
But yeah,
but they'll just say it like that is going to be rough.

1152
01:08:37.901 --> 01:08:39.620
But that's all it,
bro.
Seriously.

1153
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:42.910
If you go into that and you experience these types of things and it's gonna

1154
01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:46.160
apply to everything,
by the way,
any big change that you make where you,

1155
01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.980
you have to deprive yourself of these bad things that you've become kind of

1156
01:08:48.981 --> 01:08:52.100
addicted to or whatever,
you're going to go through all kinds of changes.

1157
01:08:52.101 --> 01:08:55.520
And that goes for workout too,
by the way,
because like just the soreness alone.

1158
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.650
Oh Dang.
I wasn't expecting the soreness.
Oh,

1159
01:08:57.651 --> 01:09:01.820
I'm like tired now because the workout like was kind of hard.
It's like,
Oh shit,

1160
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.930
I wasn't expecting that.
I was expecting to feel great after my workout,

1161
01:09:04.931 --> 01:09:06.020
how everyone says or whatever.

1162
01:09:06.021 --> 01:09:08.810
So you're going to run into all these little things that no one tells you about

1163
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:11.660
and then it's like,
well,
I didn't sign up for that little part of it.

1164
01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.900
And then wherever that little part,
and then you're going to have the diet thing.

1165
01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:18.410
I think you're wrong.
I think the Diet thing,
I think if you're,
I think it's very,

1166
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:23.090
I think it's easier in fact to just be like,
I'm done.
It's not like,
okay,

1167
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:26.930
you know what?
I'm only going to eat a quarter bag of Cheetos a day from now on.

1168
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:32.140
I don't think that works.
I think you've gotta be like,
no,
no,
no,
no Cheetos,

1169
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:33.373
Cheetos in my house.

1170
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.920
But I do think that you could work out so hard that you're so sore that you,

1171
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:41.120
that you say,
Oh man,

1172
01:09:41.121 --> 01:09:44.000
I'm just to like kind of like the Jujitsu question earlier on.
Like you could be,

1173
01:09:44.001 --> 01:09:47.990
what if someone's so sore that they can't do their job right and they're just

1174
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.480
sore all day at work?
Well that's not cool.

1175
01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:53.960
So I think for Diet you can,

1176
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:58.970
you can go cold Turkey or actually called steak or hot steak.

1177
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:02.240
And then I think for working out is the one you,
you,

1178
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:07.760
you figure out what you can do and you push a little bit harder,

1179
01:10:07.761 --> 01:10:10.670
but you don't go level nine,
maximum destruction madness.

1180
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.190
I think you're wrong respectfully.

1181
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.180
And which part do you think I'm wrong on the Diet?

1182
01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.030
I think if you go extreme with your diet,

1183
01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.050
I think that it'll work for some people for sure.

1184
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:24.280
But depending on who you are.
But I think you're more,

1185
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.790
if you go extreme of the Diet,
you don't like slowly phase out the west.

1186
01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:30.440
You know what's,
you know what's interesting?
I don't know if you remember,

1187
01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:34.820
I read a letter a while back on the podcast about a guy that had red way of the

1188
01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:37.880
warrior kid and he fixed his life.

1189
01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:42.800
Him and that guy did what you're saying.
He just made little changes.

1190
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:47.370
He made little changes along the way.
So maybe it's personal.

1191
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.260
It's probably personality.
In fact,
let's just go ahead and say it's personality.

1192
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:55.070
Some people are gonna just have to get the damn Cheetos out of their house.

1193
01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.740
All of them.
Yeah.
And some people will say,
you know what?

1194
01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:02.640
I'm only going to have this one cup full of Cheetos every day.
Yeah.
And Eat.

1195
01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:06.350
And that's okay,
but,
but here's where you gotta be careful.

1196
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:11.840
You may lie to yourself
and you can lie to yourself.
Hey,

1197
01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.960
you can lie to yourself and be like,
ah,
know,
I don't really that,
that,
that,

1198
01:11:14.961 --> 01:11:18.910
that big of a deal today.
If I just have two cups of Cheetos and today.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1199
01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:19.561
Nine cubs.

1200
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:24.210
The Cheetos later Cheeto Gfsi and respectfully.

1201
01:11:24.211 --> 01:11:27.600
I don't like your Cheetos example.
Why?
Because you're like,

1202
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.200
I'm going to allow myself to eat.
Okay.
Don't allow yourself to those.

1203
01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:34.320
That's not how small of a change you're going to make.

1204
01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.480
If you're not gonna eat Cheetos anymore,
you're not going to eat Cheetos anymore.

1205
01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:39.030
I'm saying like if you go extreme on the your diet,
let's say you eat,

1206
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:42.930
when you say what you're saying is,
hey,

1207
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.630
I'm going to change my diet.
Okay.

1208
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.050
I used to eat every day.

1209
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:54.110
I'd eat a whole bag of Cheetos and now I'm only gonna eat one cup of Cheetos

1210
01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:57.300
from the bag a day.
That's improvement.

1211
01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.140
It is improving its small improvement and if I could do that,
then why?

1212
01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:04.590
Why is that not okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
If you choose to do that,
but okay,

1213
01:12:04.591 --> 01:12:08.610
now we're going into the specifics of a certain person's thing.

1214
01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:10.080
I would say this,

1215
01:12:10.081 --> 01:12:13.650
this is more along lines of what I'm thinking as far as specific examples.

1216
01:12:13.651 --> 01:12:15.390
If you're going to go,
if I'm going to eat one bag of Cheetos,

1217
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:19.410
obviously that's not all I'm eating.
I'm eating other stuff.
I'm,

1218
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.320
the small change is I'm not gonna eat Cheetos anymore.

1219
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:26.780
I'm going to cut out Cheetos.
That's it.
I'm still not eating that good.
You know,

1220
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:30.720
I'm cut out Cheetos or let's say a,
I get um,
you know,

1221
01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:34.740
drive through every day,
three times a day.
Okay.

1222
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.150
I won't get drive through anymore or all.
That's a big change.

1223
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:44.050
Not necessarily,
depending on what you get going from three drive through a day,

1224
01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.620
two to zero.
The how's that?
Not a big chair.

1225
01:12:46.621 --> 01:12:49.830
That's a big challenge is going from like,
and there are certain people,

1226
01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:54.831
actually I was talking to someone the other day that had lost 150 pounds a

1227
01:12:56.161 --> 01:12:59.310
female and it was interesting,
her nutritionist,

1228
01:12:59.311 --> 01:13:02.820
she hired a nutritionist and the nutritionist said,
okay,

1229
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.110
what are the foods you can't live without?
And we'll work around those.

1230
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.970
That's a pretty cool thing.
And what she said was,
I need cheeseburgers and fries.

1231
01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.350
So then what she got told was something along the lines of,
okay,

1232
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:19.960
you can have cheese burger and fries on Friday.
Yeah,
yeah.

1233
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:24.570
Instead of,
you know,
this,
this whole thing of I can never read it.

1234
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.060
Now what I'm saying is there are people,

1235
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:30.330
and I think I'm one of these people where it's like,
Oh,

1236
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:32.340
if I have cheeseburgers and fries today,

1237
01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:35.040
well then I might as well just get a mint chocolate chip milkshake with it.

1238
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.820
And if I did that tonight,
then you know what,
tomorrow morning,
Hey,

1239
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.100
after you get done training,

1240
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.190
maybe if you know that cheeseburger was good yesterday,
how cloud.

1241
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:46.980
So maybe it's my own personal weakness,
but for me,
I,

1242
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:51.150
I'd prefer to be just like on the path.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's why the 80 20 rule,

1243
01:13:51.151 --> 01:13:53.790
and I talked about this in the field manual,
the 80 20 role,

1244
01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:56.610
maybe it works for some people and I guess it does work for me,

1245
01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:01.230
but I'd rather just be straight on the program.
You know what I mean?
And,

1246
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:05.070
and then,
and you know what Tim Ferriss has that thing where,

1247
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:10.270
or he's talked about the thing where he goes six days hardcore strict and then

1248
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.580
the seventh day you literally eat whatever you want as much as you can.

1249
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.230
And I tried that I have and it's really,

1250
01:14:20.231 --> 01:14:24.160
really good because you feel really,
really good.

1251
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.040
Not only physically but just about the whole deal.

1252
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.940
I'm on the program and you kind of know and on that,
on that cheat day you do,

1253
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:32.380
they call it the cheat day,

1254
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:35.410
you eat whatever you want and you don't feel any guilt at all.

1255
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:40.830
Even when you're on the 80 20 it's like you have to be coming off a real strong

1256
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:43.360
weak to be,

1257
01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.890
to feel good about three hours are good too.
Yeah.

1258
01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:53.310
And that's what's even really that bad of a cheat day.
Cheat Day is like fries.

1259
01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:58.030
Then you're starting to go into it for sure.
But
like,
you know,

1260
01:14:58.031 --> 01:15:01.620
a cheat day,
cheat day,
like ask Tam Hilt.
It'll be like for real,

1261
01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:05.290
like a whole thing of donuts.
Redox,
a cook.
Yeah,
whatever you want.

1262
01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.010
Straight up whatever you want.
Here's the thing though,
with when you,

1263
01:15:09.011 --> 01:15:12.730
when you start to eat healthy and then you try to eat a whole box of donuts,

1264
01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:16.780
you after like one,
two,
three,
maybe six,
eight donuts,
you going to be like

1265
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:22.660
in six donuts,
easy.
Six donuts in one second.
Gosh,
you know those,

1266
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:26.000
I think they're called intimate old fashion.
They're like,
you know what I mean?

1267
01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.850
They'll give me the little chocolate dawn.
That's no,
you know what?

1268
01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.980
I'm to full size donut,
great out there.
Kind of a little bit bigger too,
you know?

1269
01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:35.950
Okay.
You know,

1270
01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:43.230
I can't even fathom eating six donuts I ever since I started talking smack about

1271
01:15:43.351 --> 01:15:46.970
donuts.
Yeah,
I know.
I can't literally can never have one again in my life.
Yeah,

1272
01:15:46.971 --> 01:15:50.480
no,
you're not allowing for sure a hundred percent a hundred percent not even.

1273
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.680
Yeah.
Even bite.
Even if you are like,
if someone was like,
Hey,
just is this out?

1274
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:57.700
When I was a little kid and my parents would buy the chocolate dawn,

1275
01:15:57.701 --> 01:16:02.500
that's the hosts is chocolate covered in chocolate and those things are good.

1276
01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:04.440
Yeah.
You can't even have one of those again.
Nope,

1277
01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.150
because I did the six day cheap program.
No,
even then you can't,
I can't do it.

1278
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:12.790
You know the old fashioned donut is right.

1279
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:15.560
It's like a doughnut with a hole in it right now.

1280
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.650
It's called old fashioned donuts.
They're like,

1281
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:21.160
it's their kind of glazed and almost like a,
not,
they're not crispy,

1282
01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:25.450
but they're kind of hard or hard on on the outside and then their regular soft

1283
01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:29.110
on,
it's on the inside and they have this glaze over.
Okay.
So I think it's,

1284
01:16:29.111 --> 01:16:30.990
I forget the name,
I think it might be intimate,

1285
01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:34.360
but they have old fashioned donuts where they're not as hard,

1286
01:16:34.361 --> 01:16:37.420
but they're kind of hard and they're just bigger.
Anyway.

1287
01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:38.380
Those were my favorite ones.

1288
01:16:38.381 --> 01:16:40.870
And Ac get chocolate milk and heat up the chocolate milk.

1289
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.660
It's like hot chocolate and donuts and all.
Yeah,
easy money.

1290
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.580
Like I'll eat two boxes of those for sure.
Or I used to anymore.
Oh yeah.

1291
01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.830
So not the point there is on a cheat day you just go,
yeah,

1292
01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.150
no shame.
But after,

1293
01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:58.060
the thing is you can't just eat doughnuts four times a day or three times.

1294
01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.090
You just don't feel good like your stomach gets all upset in.

1295
01:17:01.091 --> 01:17:03.370
The more healthy you eat,
the more it's going to be like that.

1296
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:08.060
So the longer you're on the path,
you start like if you ate some donut,

1297
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:12.470
like the other day we went to the Belmont Park and I ate some ice cream,

1298
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:17.390
some mint chocolate chip ice screener.
Was it good?
Fine.
It was good.
But you know,

1299
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:20.180
all the kids are doing whatever's tracks the the night.
Yeah.

1300
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:24.100
You eat a big large double.
You know what?
After,
after that you're like,
Bro,

1301
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:27.350
I don't feel right.
You know,
so unless you're just committed to eat it,

1302
01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:29.330
cause I don't know,
you don't want to waste it or something like that,

1303
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:32.720
you're going to be like,
aw,
my cheat.
Your cheat day is not going to be that bad.

1304
01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.150
This is what I'm saying.
Oh,
okay.

1305
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.950
But I'm still do have that freedom making it happen.
It depends on what it is.

1306
01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:42.080
Yeah.
Yeah.
You could pump some Chili fries or something.
I don't like Chili fries.

1307
01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:47.360
All right.
So yeah,
maybe what's the verdict then?

1308
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.330
I think just in the middle of the road nut,

1309
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:54.950
the whole starting life balance.
So you're saying balanced as well.

1310
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.800
I'll tell you though,
man,
if that balance doesn't work for you,

1311
01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:00.260
you're going to have to step it up.
You're gonna have to go hardcore.

1312
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.210
I'd give yourself two weeks,

1313
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.960
two weeks for a balanced approach on the diet side.

1314
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:10.160
If you can't get your shit under control in two weeks,
you got to go hardcore.

1315
01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:13.550
You've got to get in there with the garbage clinic can throw away the Twinkies,

1316
01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:18.670
throw away everything else that's crap and your fridge and go hardcore and start

1317
01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.070
with a fast too,

1318
01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.850
a fast as awesome a fast.

1319
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:27.260
I don't even know that there's that much to expect.

1320
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:31.280
The only for a day if you never done it before,
it's not that big of a deal.

1321
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.640
There's no little stuff.
Don't eat your day.
There's little,

1322
01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:39.530
there's not take you from a normal human being.
This little stuff,
they,

1323
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:44.300
if you're not,
if you go in and not prepared for it,
then you're like,
oh,

1324
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:46.910
actually no.
Actually I think the more you think about it,
prepare for it.

1325
01:18:46.911 --> 01:18:50.060
The more psychologically order it is just to be like,
oh yeah,
you know what?

1326
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:52.520
I woke up this morning.
I haven't had eaten the last night call.

1327
01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:54.940
I'm not going to eat until tonight.
Every time that's

1328
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:59.930
when I'm like,
I'm not going to until this.
Then I go through little stuff,

1329
01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.540
but if I just have,
if I'm too into work,

1330
01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.090
I don't only drinking coffee and I forget.
I'm like Dang,

1331
01:19:05.091 --> 01:19:09.770
if if I eat and I haven't ate for like 12 hours,
then I'll be like,

1332
01:19:09.771 --> 01:19:12.920
oh I'll just go another three.
That's my 15 cause it's like 15 right.

1333
01:19:12.921 --> 01:19:17.921
15 hours is when your body starts to kind of shift over to like I think 15 what

1334
01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:22.010
I read is core,
so I'll just wait that shower.
It's like cool.
Done.

1335
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:26.320
But if a planet,
that's when,
yeah,
I dunno,

1336
01:19:26.490 --> 01:19:28.300
but it depends on who you are man.
But that's a good,

1337
01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:29.820
I agree with the fingers off.
Yeah.

1338
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:34.250
That's a good way to kick things off and get like jump onto the path.
Yeah.

1339
01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:38.780
His jump on with a fast.
Yep.
Hey,
go see your doctor or whatever.

1340
01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:43.500
If you go see a doctor to fast 24 hours,
I think you should if you've been

1341
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:50.900
a fat lazy,
you know,
especially if you're older or something like that.

1342
01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.010
I think CIENA talks get a personal trainer.
Depends on what you mean.

1343
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:57.530
Helmet and I just talked to,

1344
01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.840
she's like personal trainer and nutritionist hired them.

1345
01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:04.170
Both lost a hundred pounds.
So yeah,

1346
01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.100
I think she was an excess of 300 pounds.
Yeah.
And when I met her,

1347
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.230
she's completely normal.
Right.

1348
01:20:10.231 --> 01:20:14.100
Like you know completely like you wouldn't even suspect that she had any weight

1349
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:16.350
trouble in her life.
That's pretty amazing.
Yeah.

1350
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.580
So hire the trainer,
hire the,
the,

1351
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.330
the nutritionist.
Yeah,
I think so.
I think that helps.

1352
01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:29.900
I always looked at it like why would I hire like a trainer or something like

1353
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:33.000
that when I can kind of look up that stuff.
But here's the thing,

1354
01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:37.320
I went in with this bias like,
cause it kind of had a background in it.

1355
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:40.410
So I'm like why would it,
I can just go look and,
but I'm looking it up,

1356
01:20:40.411 --> 01:20:44.190
but I have all this other knowledge.
The same rule.
You've try it for two weeks,

1357
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:49.200
see if you can keep yourself on the path and if you can't got to bring someone

1358
01:20:49.201 --> 01:20:51.690
in.
Right.
Here's what I like.

1359
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:54.270
Hire a trainer but not like every day.

1360
01:20:54.271 --> 01:20:58.470
It's like a once a week trainer who can get you on a little program and that's,

1361
01:20:58.471 --> 01:21:01.650
you know,
it's going to depend on who you are straight up,

1362
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:04.010
you know who can keep you on.
Yeah.

1363
01:21:04.011 --> 01:21:08.100
I mean that's the biggest part of all this and I've said this a billion times,

1364
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:12.210
like you know what you need to do.
Yeah.
You know what you need to do.
You know?

1365
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:15.630
You know what you need to do.
If you can't get yourself to do it,

1366
01:21:15.631 --> 01:21:17.880
maybe you need to give someone to help you do it.
Yeah.

1367
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:21.390
The weird thing is like nutritionists and stuff,

1368
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.520
you can get nutritionist that could come to you and be like,
okay,

1369
01:21:23.521 --> 01:21:26.280
we're going to go put you on a low fat diet.
You know,

1370
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.950
which would be really not good seeing you in the wrong direction.

1371
01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.500
I don't know how many of you think there's still nutritionists that are doing

1372
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:35.110
that right now.
There are,
I know there are actually,
there are some,

1373
01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.640
there are out there so you've gotta be careful that
check

1374
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:45.510
next west.
Last thing that,
I'm not going to draw it out,

1375
01:21:45.511 --> 01:21:50.511
but you said you know what you need to do and one time you said imagine what

1376
01:21:52.231 --> 01:21:55.860
your day would look like.
Like if you,
like everything you did

1377
01:21:57.390 --> 01:22:00.900
was you did the things that you knew you were supposed to do it kind of thing.

1378
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.370
Well the,
the,
the full,

1379
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:07.820
the full statement is if you wrote down tonight what you were supposed to do

1380
01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:09.370
tomorrow,
you know,

1381
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:14.130
and then you did the things that you were supposed to imagine how that day would

1382
01:22:14.131 --> 01:22:16.640
feel and imagine what you'd get done in that day.
Yeah.

1383
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:21.510
And then imagine if you did that everyday for a week and imagine if you did that

1384
01:22:21.511 --> 01:22:24.270
everyday for a month and they did it for a year and imagine where your life

1385
01:22:24.271 --> 01:22:27.850
would be.
Your life would be in a completely different trajectory.
Complete.

1386
01:22:27.851 --> 01:22:31.020
Completely different.
Yeah.
And that's true with working out.

1387
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:33.930
That's true with nutrition.
That's true with business.
That's true with education.

1388
01:22:33.931 --> 01:22:35.220
That truth knowledge.

1389
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:40.170
True with everything and everything to kind of know what we're supposed to do.

1390
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:43.860
Yeah.
Oh,
I thought you were going to say some people don't know what to do.

1391
01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:47.190
I'm not,
could be the case.
Some people they've never worked out before,

1392
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:50.070
and if you're a person that's never worked out before,

1393
01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.340
you probably need to bring someone into the game that's going to help show you

1394
01:22:53.341 --> 01:22:54.174
how to work out.

1395
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:59.270
If you've never done any reading about eating and you have no idea what's going

1396
01:23:00.361 --> 01:23:01.194
to be good for you,

1397
01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:04.380
you're probably a person that might need to bring someone into the game to help

1398
01:23:04.381 --> 01:23:05.980
you get over that.
Yeah,

1399
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.500
<v 1>and it's still completely goes with exactly what you said.</v>

1400
01:23:08.501 --> 01:23:12.460
It's like you know what to do and even to help that you know what not to do.

1401
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:15.010
Like when you're,
you're about to make decision,
I'm gonna do this or not do this.

1402
01:23:15.011 --> 01:23:17.260
Like you know which one is you should or shouldn't do.

1403
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:19.960
So let's say I don't know anything about working out,

1404
01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.880
but I know I have to get in shape.
We all know and you know,

1405
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:24.250
we all know when we got to get in shape,

1406
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:26.410
so then you know you're going to hire somebody,

1407
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.350
you know you've got to do something.
You know that you might even just be like,

1408
01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:31.060
oh well I'm not going to do it.
I don't know.
I'm not going to do it.

1409
01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:34.720
Things to do tomorrow in a trainer,
join a gym,

1410
01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:38.710
get a trainer.
Yeah,
I don't know what to do.
Okay,
this is what you can do.

1411
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:43.090
Find out what to do.
There you go.
Then in that case,
so you got to make sense.

1412
01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:46.900
Sometimes when you put things in,
just say stuff,
just put it on the table.

1413
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.110
Just starts to make sense.
Next question.

1414
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:55.620
I'm a veteran of the infantry and when I took over a fire team for the first

1415
01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:59.140
time,
I made the mistake of drawing hard lines in the sand.

1416
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:05.050
This immediately alienated members of that team that had been together for some

1417
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:05.860
time.

1418
01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.630
I did not make that mistake again and I definitely learned from my experience,

1419
01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.540
so clearly there's not a question there.
Yeah,
and

1420
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:19.860
<v 0>I forget pulling this out from,
I get a lot of emails and messages and all that,</v>

1421
01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:24.180
but I thought it was a good point to bring up to say,

1422
01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:29.580
you know,
this idea of drawing hard lines in the sand and what that does to your

1423
01:24:29.581 --> 01:24:32.970
leadership position.
It's,
it's a,
it's a difficult,

1424
01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:37.980
it's usually not a good thing to do if you draw a lot hard lines in the sand and

1425
01:24:37.981 --> 01:24:42.510
eventually you realize that they're either unrealistic or people can't maintain

1426
01:24:42.511 --> 01:24:46.620
them,
you have set yourself up for failure.
What does that exactly like us,

1427
01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:51.910
no matter what,
we will not Gotcha.
Blah,
blah,

1428
01:24:51.911 --> 01:24:55.380
blah.
There's the Lug,
no matter what we will,

1429
01:24:55.410 --> 01:25:00.410
we will win every single road march that we do as a fire team in this while

1430
01:25:00.691 --> 01:25:05.560
we're,
while we're here on this training thing.
Hmm,
okay,
well guess what?
That's a,

1431
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.920
that's hard.
There's other,

1432
01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.540
there's some other fire teams that are also wanting to win and and so you've

1433
01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:14.790
drawn a hard line to send.
That's not really a good example.

1434
01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:18.750
A good example.
It's like,
no matter what,

1435
01:25:18.751 --> 01:25:22.470
we're going to muster every morning at four 30 in the morning no matter what.

1436
01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:25.140
And you know,

1437
01:25:25.141 --> 01:25:30.141
then the guys are out on patrol until two 38 in the morning and now the next

1438
01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:33.690
morning you're good.
No matter what I said,
no matter what,
it's not good for them.

1439
01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:35.070
It's unrealistic.

1440
01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.110
So you drew a hard line in the sand and now you've got to back it down.
So,

1441
01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:42.930
and all you have to do is soften the statement a little bit.
Hey guys,

1442
01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.820
to the best of our ability,
if we can,

1443
01:25:44.821 --> 01:25:48.240
we're going to get here every morning at four 30 from Oster.
There's a little,

1444
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.740
there's a little room to play there.
Right.
And that's,
that's fine.

1445
01:25:53.490 --> 01:25:58.440
So again,
I,
I,
there's,
there's not a lot of,

1446
01:25:58.650 --> 01:26:03.130
there's not a question here,
but one of the reasons I think that,
that I,

1447
01:26:03.150 --> 01:26:04.070
that I wanted to talk

1448
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.130
<v 2>about it was because I think people look at me.
Yeah.</v>

1449
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:11.570
And even hear me on a peripheral level and they think,
oh,

1450
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:16.420
I bet jack would just lay down the hard lines.
Sure.
Yeah.

1451
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:21.320
It's my way or the highway.
Right?
Yeah.
And,
and the,
the,

1452
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:23.300
the opposite is actually true.

1453
01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:28.900
And the reason that I came to that conclusion was because I worked for leaders

1454
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.330
like that and I hated working for leaders like that.

1455
01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:38.570
So I tried to never be a leader like that.

1456
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:42.710
<v 4>Hmm.
And there's a dichotomy,</v>

1457
01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:44.140
<v 2>right?</v>

1458
01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:49.140
She was a huge dichotomy because this doesn't mean that you're not driving and

1459
01:26:49.271 --> 01:26:52.150
pushing,
this doesn't mean that you're not saying,
hey,
we're going to be the best,

1460
01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:56.350
whatever.
Would it be the best task unit here?
It doesn't mean you're not saying,

1461
01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.620
hey,
look,
we're not going to rest until we've done what we're supposed to do.

1462
01:26:59.621 --> 01:27:00.510
Doesn't mean that.

1463
01:27:00.690 --> 01:27:01.523
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1464
01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:04.690
<v 2>What man,
you got to find that balance.</v>

1465
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:09.080
<v 4>Yeah.
It does feel like that with you.</v>

1466
01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.980
<v 2>Yeah.
You're like,
it feels like that,
but when you were one,
I mean,</v>

1467
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.790
my experience obviously is we're an under no,

1468
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:20.990
like extreme circumstances,
but just like,
just like the simple stuff,

1469
01:27:20.991 --> 01:27:24.650
like it really does seem like you wake up at four 30 in the morning every single

1470
01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:28.720
morning,
do or die when the percent I did that.
I do,
uh,

1471
01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:31.460
unless like there's sometimes where I get home at,

1472
01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:35.360
like I remember a little while ago I got home at one o'clock or two o'clock in

1473
01:27:35.361 --> 01:27:38.690
the morning and that's basically my cutoff zone.

1474
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.650
If I'm getting less than four and a half hours of sleep,
then I'll be like,

1475
01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.230
oh yeah,
I'll wake up.
And I've been like,
Hey,

1476
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:48.830
I only got two and a half hours of sleep last night.
That's not enough.

1477
01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.930
I'm going back to bed.
Right.
That's the end.

1478
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:55.680
That's what I mean where I've tweeted that out before.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

1479
01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:59.330
I get,
yeah,
that's,
that's what I mean.
Yeah.
So it's like when,
when that happens,

1480
01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:02.630
it almost like he catches you off guard,
you know,
when you,
when you,

1481
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:06.720
when you did that,
I mean,
obviously not like,
oh,
drill cools daughters strict.

1482
01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.620
It's not that feeling at all.
It's just kind of like,
Oh Dang.

1483
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:13.400
You do have that flexibility when you know,

1484
01:28:13.401 --> 01:28:17.900
when it's the correct thing kinda thing.
Yeah.
You have to,
yeah.

1485
01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:22.280
You're not a slave to your,
uh,
rigidity.
Well,

1486
01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:25.370
what you're saying is I don't draw hard lines in the sand.

1487
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:32.550
Yes,
exactly right.
But it's real easy to go down the slippery slope of like,
wow,

1488
01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:36.590
you know,
I actually didn't eat real good yesterday,

1489
01:28:36.591 --> 01:28:41.150
so I probably need some more sleep and recovery day.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

1490
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:44.710
Well I am.
I'm,
it's a rest day,
so I might as well turn on the TV.
Oh,

1491
01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:47.180
well it'd be good with TVS.
Maybe some popcorn.
Oh,
you know,

1492
01:28:47.181 --> 01:28:50.520
it'd be good with the popcorn.
Maybe some cheese sticks until payment apps.

1493
01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:54.870
It's the rest day,
right?
Yeah.
He went down that slippery wrong pass.

1494
01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:58.670
That's what I'm saying.
I guess the,
I guess the opposite of the of the,

1495
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:01.100
of the path is the slippery slope.

1496
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.420
<v 0>Exactly.
Right.
Next question.</v>

1497
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:10.900
Hi Scenario.
It's actually legit way to think of it too.
Yeah.

1498
01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.020
If it's a legit way to think of things.

1499
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:16.170
If you're on the path when you know what the Path is,

1500
01:29:16.171 --> 01:29:19.260
as we talked about with Tim Ferris,
if you're on the path,

1501
01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:24.330
which you know well,
when you step off the path,
it's a slippery slope.

1502
01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:28.230
Meal off the path is a slippery,
slippery slope.

1503
01:29:28.231 --> 01:29:32.130
And then what'd you just say?
The popcorn can lead to cheat sticks,

1504
01:29:32.131 --> 01:29:35.760
can lead to Bam and dams.
That's the slippery slope right there.

1505
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:40.290
And sometimes he slipped so hard that you just plunge deep

1506
01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.570
off the path,
fall off the wagon.
Land hard

1507
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.140
<v 1>scenario.</v>

1508
01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:52.700
My team leaders boss came to me and asked my opinion on my horrible team leader.

1509
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:54.820
<v 0>Okay,
awesome.</v>

1510
01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:58.240
<v 1>My boss's boss,
one of my opinion.
So what do I do?</v>

1511
01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:02.350
Praise him to make the team look good and maintained my relationship with my,

1512
01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:06.760
with the team leader or tactfully tell the truth and build the relationship with

1513
01:30:06.761 --> 01:30:07.594
the boss with,

1514
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.700
<v 0>that's a good question,
isn't it?
This is a,</v>

1515
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:13.750
that's a really tough position to be in.
Yeah.

1516
01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.640
Because you have to be careful and you have to be balanced.

1517
01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:19.940
And there's a couple of things to think about.
First of all,
no one likes rats.

1518
01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:23.990
Yeah,
right.
No one likes rats,

1519
01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:27.920
but at the same time you kind of also have to think about what's best for the

1520
01:30:27.921 --> 01:30:30.350
team on top of,

1521
01:30:30.351 --> 01:30:35.230
and kind of the opposite of no one likes rats is no one likes Brown nosers.
No.

1522
01:30:35.690 --> 01:30:38.630
But at the same time you have to build relationships up and down the chain of

1523
01:30:38.631 --> 01:30:39.170
command.

1524
01:30:39.170 --> 01:30:43.520
And one of the toughest things about this and what you have to be so careful

1525
01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:47.180
about is that you don't know what kind of relationship the boss and the team

1526
01:30:47.181 --> 01:30:51.830
leader have.
You don't know for a one end of the spectrum they can be friends.

1527
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:55.430
So if you say something bad about them that's going right back to the team

1528
01:30:55.431 --> 01:30:59.590
leader and you're in your,
you're going to have a hard time,
much worse position.

1529
01:30:59.591 --> 01:31:00.350
Yeah.

1530
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:05.350
Also they could be enemies and supporting the team lead to the boss could

1531
01:31:08.781 --> 01:31:13.040
actually make you look stupid.
Right.
Making make you look bad.

1532
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:17.150
And,
and it's important to say here,

1533
01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:23.630
is it the optics of like I don't want to look bad.

1534
01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.600
Is that what I'm talking about?
Cause that's what I just said.

1535
01:31:26.601 --> 01:31:28.370
Like it'll make you look bad or make you look stupid.

1536
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:33.860
The reason that you're trying to look good is because you want to do a good job

1537
01:31:33.861 --> 01:31:35.750
because you want the team,
cause you want the mission to succeed.

1538
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:39.470
That that's what's important.
And you don't care.

1539
01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.980
I don't care if I have to eat crow,
I don't care if so.

1540
01:31:42.981 --> 01:31:46.910
So I don't mind looking bad if it's for a good reason.

1541
01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:49.550
I don't mind my ego taking a dig if it's for the right reason.

1542
01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:55.180
But this could actually hurt the way I do my job because now my boss,

1543
01:31:57.230 --> 01:32:01.390
my boss,
sorry,
my boss's boss thinks I'm kind of an idiot.
It's,

1544
01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:03.430
that means when promote comes time for promotion,

1545
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:04.630
even though I might be the best guy,

1546
01:32:04.631 --> 01:32:07.600
I'm not getting promoted because I was the guy that was too blind to see that my

1547
01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:09.200
team leader was an idiot.
Yeah.

1548
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:15.390
So I would be very careful and fairly neutral

1549
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:21.530
in what I said,
especially to start with.
Right.
So you know,
if the,

1550
01:32:21.531 --> 01:32:25.300
if the boss says,
hey,
how's that team leader do it?
My responsibility,

1551
01:32:25.301 --> 01:32:30.110
how do you know we get the job done?
That's so noncommittal.
Right.

1552
01:32:31.170 --> 01:32:35.360
Well what about the team leader?
Is He,
is he a good leader?
I think he's,

1553
01:32:35.630 --> 01:32:38.630
I think he's got a pretty good hold of what's going on.
Right.
So that's,

1554
01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:42.140
that's there's room to interpret that in any direction really.
Yeah,

1555
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.290
I think he's got a pretty good hold.
All right.

1556
01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:48.800
I think he's getting a hold of what's going on.
Or Oh,

1557
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:51.440
another one would be,
well,
hey,
how's your team leader?

1558
01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:57.440
I think our performance kind of shows where we're at,
right?
So you're not,

1559
01:32:57.441 --> 01:33:00.170
you're not giving away.
And those are those that,
like I said,

1560
01:33:00.171 --> 01:33:04.670
those are subtle and those are very open things that you could respond to.
And,

1561
01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:10.410
and I think the more your boss robes or the of the Mo,

1562
01:33:10.411 --> 01:33:13.320
the teen boss team leaders,
bosses probes,

1563
01:33:14.670 --> 01:33:18.360
the more you can open up a little bit still with caution.

1564
01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:21.540
But as you see what the boss's opinion is,

1565
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:26.550
you could open up a little bit more and share a little bit more of the truth

1566
01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:29.010
very tactfully.
Or if,

1567
01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.420
or you could go in the other direction.
Right?
If you said,
oh,
you don't,

1568
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:37.140
that's my best guy.
And I've known bill forever.
Yeah.
Bills.

1569
01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:40.110
I brought him here at bill's going to be,
he's going places.

1570
01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.520
So are you going to derail that guy?
You,
you can,

1571
01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:46.400
but you're probably gonna derail yourself too,

1572
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:51.840
because that guy has a bludge intimate relationship with them.
So

1573
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:55.700
that's a tough situation.
And,

1574
01:33:55.730 --> 01:34:00.200
and I would say the best thing to do in this situation is remain as neutral as

1575
01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:02.800
possible.
And again,
you know what,
there's,

1576
01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:05.430
there's someone that's listening to this right now.
Let's go,
oh,

1577
01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:08.870
jock was kind of a jock who's kind of a wimp.
If I was there,

1578
01:34:08.871 --> 01:34:11.270
I just tell the truth.
Okay,
so let's,
let's talk about that.

1579
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:12.350
Let's talk about what happens.

1580
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:16.280
Cause I've been in that situation more times than I can count where my boss was

1581
01:34:16.281 --> 01:34:20.330
kind of an idiot and I get asked by his boss,
hey,
how's this guy doing?

1582
01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.630
So let's say you rat them out.
Well,

1583
01:34:23.631 --> 01:34:26.300
does that mean that the boss gets fired immediately?
No.

1584
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:28.610
It just means that your team is less respected.

1585
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:33.260
It means that you get less support.
It means,

1586
01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:36.470
and if you do get ratted out,
by the way,
where do you end up now?

1587
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:39.640
You end up in a bad situation where the,

1588
01:34:39.650 --> 01:34:44.030
your boss knows that you ratted him out to his boss.

1589
01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:49.160
You're hated.
Yeah,
you're hated.
So I wanna win.

1590
01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:51.200
Let's go back to that point.
I want to win.

1591
01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:56.860
So does it help me win if I rat out my boss or if I rat out my team leader to

1592
01:34:57.170 --> 01:35:01.910
boss?
Does it help me when
it could?

1593
01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.411
It could.

1594
01:35:03.411 --> 01:35:07.370
If your boss happens to be completely aligned with what you're thinking,

1595
01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.060
he also happens to have a replacement ready that's more squared away.

1596
01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:13.640
That's another thing.
You get rid of one bad team leader.

1597
01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:18.410
Now you get a new team leader.
How do you know him?
Who's that?
Who is that person?

1598
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:21.470
Where'd they come from?
The devils.
What does that saying?

1599
01:35:21.710 --> 01:35:24.500
The devil you know is better than the devil that you don't know.

1600
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:28.910
So if I have a team leader that's not doing a good job,
who's fault is that?

1601
01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:35.550
Right?
Yeah.
I can help my team leader,
especially if my team leaders week,

1602
01:35:35.551 --> 01:35:36.720
I can help them become strong.

1603
01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:40.260
I can help teach them tactfully not stepping on their toes.

1604
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:44.760
I would rather rather than rap my team leader out up the chain of command,

1605
01:35:44.761 --> 01:35:46.710
I would rather fix my team leader.

1606
01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:51.060
I would rather help my team leader become better support them.

1607
01:35:51.810 --> 01:35:52.560
And by the way,

1608
01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.400
when you do support your team leader and they become better and now they do come

1609
01:35:56.401 --> 01:35:58.860
up for a promotion,
what do they know in the back of their mind?

1610
01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.070
They know that you helped him.
They knew that.
Know that you got them there.

1611
01:36:02.071 --> 01:36:04.890
Guess who's getting promoted now you are now.

1612
01:36:04.891 --> 01:36:06.570
Why am I so concerned about getting promoted?

1613
01:36:06.571 --> 01:36:10.560
Just cause I wanna want to outdo everyone else.
No,
that's not why?

1614
01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:13.170
Because you want to win.
Cause I want to win.
I want the team to win.

1615
01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.940
And if I thought that you echo would do a better job if you became team leader

1616
01:36:17.941 --> 01:36:20.220
instead of me,
I'd be like,
Hey,
I appreciate it.

1617
01:36:20.221 --> 01:36:22.770
But Echo would do a better job than me.
He should be the team leader.

1618
01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:25.453
<v 3>So</v>

1619
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:32.020
<v 0>and,
and also if you re this is what happens if I'm really a person,
this is,</v>

1620
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:33.480
this is this,
this is what I'm getting at.

1621
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:36.870
If I'm really a person that really wants to get promoted and that's my main
goal,

1622
01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:41.420
I want to get promoted,
that's my goal.
What do I do with the team leader out?

1623
01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:45.780
I throw him under the bus.
So that's the person that we all hate.

1624
01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.610
The person that rats out,
the team leader that that says,
oh,

1625
01:36:50.730 --> 01:36:51.870
that guy's doing a terrible job.

1626
01:36:51.871 --> 01:36:54.600
I'd do much better job and gets that guy fired and now I get promoted.

1627
01:36:54.601 --> 01:36:59.310
What do we all think of them?
We all think that guy's a turd now,

1628
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:03.390
as opposed to someone that says,
you know what?
Our team leaders week needs help,

1629
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.260
needs support.
I'm going to help them.
I'm going to support him.

1630
01:37:07.410 --> 01:37:10.340
I'm going to do the best I can.
Wait,
are you saying to tell the boss this,

1631
01:37:11.370 --> 01:37:13.170
to have that attitude like I'm not gonna,

1632
01:37:13.230 --> 01:37:14.190
I'm not gonna to throw him under the bus.

1633
01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.360
Now if we have a guy that's horrible,

1634
01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:21.690
that's tyrannical,
that does a horrible job,
that abuses people,

1635
01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:24.420
then we get to a situation where you say,
you know what boss?

1636
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:28.020
There are some problems.
Yeah,
so if you have that one,

1637
01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:31.200
which doesn't really where this guy says horrible team leader.

1638
01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.980
So if this is a horrible team leader that's irredeemable,

1639
01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:40.290
irredeemable qualities and it's negatively affecting the team cause he kind of

1640
01:37:40.291 --> 01:37:43.170
makes it sound like make the team look good.
So there's,
there's,

1641
01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.200
there's still a possibility that the team is doing okay even though they have a

1642
01:37:46.201 --> 01:37:48.090
horrible eater cause they are such good troops.

1643
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:52.320
I would see that sometimes they'll platoon has a bad leader but there's great

1644
01:37:52.321 --> 01:37:55.200
guys in there and the platoon leader is smart enough just to like,

1645
01:37:55.201 --> 01:37:58.530
okay I'm going to let them kind of run with it and they'll be successful.
Yeah.

1646
01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.890
So my,

1647
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.700
my goal usually is to help the person above me in the chest wall.

1648
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:07.620
It's always to help the person above me at the chain of command.

1649
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:12.210
Can you get to a situation where someone is so bad that it's negatively

1650
01:38:12.211 --> 01:38:17.130
effecting the whole team and you can't win because their position?
Yes.

1651
01:38:17.131 --> 01:38:19.680
Well then you need to step up and do something about it and say something about

1652
01:38:19.681 --> 01:38:22.470
it.
Do it tactfully.
Do it slowly.

1653
01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:27.510
Don't overcommit to your statements early on because if you do,

1654
01:38:27.511 --> 01:38:29.730
you might say something that is out aligned.

1655
01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.350
So that's,
it's a tricky situation.

1656
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:38.010
There's no definitive answer,
but you have to weigh these things out.

1657
01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:43.740
Generally,
if you can help someone win,
you're gonna win.
Generally,

1658
01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:45.390
if you help someone when you're going to win,

1659
01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:50.660
if it's so bad that they're just bringing down the whole team and you cannot win

1660
01:38:51.271 --> 01:38:55.350
with them in that position,
you might need to say something.
Yeah.

1661
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:57.750
Especially if everyone on the team kind of feels the same way.

1662
01:38:57.751 --> 01:39:00.160
It's going to be a little bit easier to be like,
hey,
you know,
yeah.

1663
01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.080
And be straightly.
Yeah.
But even if everyone was w we,
we,

1664
01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:08.220
if we have the gang mentality,
right?
Like,
hey man,
the boss sucks.
You know what?

1665
01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.240
He's team leaders.
Horrible.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
Hey guys,

1666
01:39:12.241 --> 01:39:12.960
you know what?

1667
01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.200
We could sit here and complain about it or we could actually try and like make

1668
01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:19.380
him a better leader.
What,
what do you guys say it?
Think of that.

1669
01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:22.320
And then because hey,
we could try and get a replacement for him,

1670
01:39:22.321 --> 01:39:25.640
but at least he listens to us right now or whatever,
you know,
at least he,

1671
01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:28.920
at least he understands the job.
Hey,
let's try and let's try and prop them up.

1672
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:31.290
Let's try and get,
we know what,
let's get rid of him,

1673
01:39:31.291 --> 01:39:33.150
but let's get rid of him by teaching him a lot.

1674
01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:35.880
So he gets educated so we can move on and get promoted and then we'll have a

1675
01:39:35.881 --> 01:39:37.440
good relationship with them.
Yeah.

1676
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:39.900
And then the team will get more support and then we can do our mission better.

1677
01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:42.683
Yeah.

1678
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.020
I guess he kind of didn't understand what makes them a quote unquote horrible

1679
01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:47.660
for sure.
For sure.
Like what if,
uh,

1680
01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:50.190
what if I don't like him cause I don't like his tie.
I Dunno.

1681
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:52.800
I don't like his hair.
Do you know,
I just don't like him.
We don't,

1682
01:39:52.801 --> 01:39:54.790
we don't come from the same side of the tracks.
I don't know.

1683
01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:00.420
One of the things that would be like,
if the guy's arrogant,
the guy's arrogant,

1684
01:40:00.690 --> 01:40:03.500
well how are we going to bring him down?
How are we going to bring,
well,

1685
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:07.260
how we not not bring him down,
like bring them down like from his job,

1686
01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:10.680
but how are we gonna bring down his ego?
How are we going to mellow him out?

1687
01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.620
You know?
And that could,
that could be a long project.

1688
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:19.290
That could be a long project.
Yeah.
So just like how you said it,
like it,

1689
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:22.500
is it damaging the,
the performance kind of thing?
Yes.

1690
01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:25.410
That's the most important thing is that what is our performance?

1691
01:40:25.411 --> 01:40:27.600
Like can we bring this guy around?

1692
01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:33.600
Good question.
I'm sorry.
There's no definitive answer,

1693
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:37.410
but at the same time there's,
so leadership is,

1694
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:42.570
is an art.
Yeah.
And why did the uh,
it's an art and science,

1695
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:43.830
but it's an art,
Sir.

1696
01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:47.410
This is a case where the artistic part is going to be more important.
Yeah,
yeah,

1697
01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:49.250
yeah.
The dichotomy.
Alright.
Insight.

1698
01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:54.070
And when bloodsport how he called martial arts martial science,
he called

1699
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:58.930
<v 2>it more Marshall sites.
The Guy,
what is his name?
Since they Tanaka I come on Bro.</v>

1700
01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:02.610
Bloodsport fend damp.
Yeah.
No,
I know.
I know what the movie is.
Yeah,

1701
01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:06.850
he called it Marshall.
I'm familiar with that.
Too familiar.
Even as a kid,

1702
01:41:06.851 --> 01:41:08.590
I thought those movies were really cheesy.

1703
01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:13.900
You can cheesy like show me like a lot,
a lot of MMA.
Well,
I guess from my age,

1704
01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:17.830
MMA guys,
you know,
I was into blood sport,
you know?
Yeah.

1705
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:21.850
Even when I was a kid I w I wasn't thinking bloodsport was like legit.

1706
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:26.960
I don't know why I thought it was one of the park yet.
The dim,
I thought rocky.

1707
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:30.700
I thought rocky was more legit.
He's dope.
Yeah.
I thought,

1708
01:41:30.701 --> 01:41:34.780
I thought that rocky was a more legit than bloodsport for me.

1709
01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.050
Blood sports seem fake.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1710
01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:41.530
I guess it just seemed extreme,
I guess.

1711
01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:44.710
Cause Poe plus I think with bloodsport the rumors circulated,

1712
01:41:44.711 --> 01:41:47.960
the tech guy was real like,
don't you?
It's like you're like,
oh,

1713
01:41:47.961 --> 01:41:52.480
it's your sure it's a movie.
Cool.
It made it fun,
but it was real gonna lie.
I,
I,

1714
01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:56.590
yeah.
Again,
I wouldn't say I hated bloodsport,

1715
01:41:57.070 --> 01:42:00.430
but like I haven't seen it enough to know that the guy referred to martial arts

1716
01:42:00.431 --> 01:42:02.470
as Marshall Science.
Those early on,

1717
01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.240
early in the movie when Van dam's teacher,
you know,
it's your typical movie,

1718
01:42:07.241 --> 01:42:11.980
right?
There's a,
there's a a guy and he's getting beat down or whatever.

1719
01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.520
He goes through his training process.
There's a,
there's a montage,

1720
01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:19.780
like in Timor team America,
world police,

1721
01:42:19.781 --> 01:42:24.190
there's a montage training montage and then he comes back and wins.
There's,

1722
01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.570
there's like most of your fight movies.
Yeah.
You know,

1723
01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.630
then montage he gets be done early.
You know,
he trains,
he becomes awesome.

1724
01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:34.320
But then there's the,
the arch enemy who's trained to,
yeah,

1725
01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.480
but still a bully and he has to beat him.
Same thing with credit kid.

1726
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:40.510
But you're leaving out the montage part in a training montage,

1727
01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.250
which is very important.
You're the best or no,
that's credit kid.

1728
01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:49.660
You ever seen the movie never backed down?
No.
Okay,
so you wouldn't,

1729
01:42:49.661 --> 01:42:53.560
you'll never watched this movie.
It's,
it's,
it's MMA.
Right.

1730
01:42:53.730 --> 01:42:57.340
And I remember when it came out.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But it's basically Craddick kid.

1731
01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:01.060
It's literally like karate kid,
but just MMA now.

1732
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:04.810
And little bit more cheesy.
Maybe a lot more cheesy.
I thought it was good though.

1733
01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:09.580
I enjoyed it and watch him like a master Jujitsu guy or something.
Yeah.

1734
01:43:09.581 --> 01:43:12.550
Brazilian guy who plays is played by an African guy.

1735
01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:15.790
The guy on your remember gladiator gladiator,
right?

1736
01:43:15.791 --> 01:43:19.630
Russell Crowe and even the black guy in there.
The African Guy?
Vaguely.
Yeah,

1737
01:43:19.631 --> 01:43:23.320
he um,
you know the one,
yeah,
the main friend.
Yeah,
he's the guy,

1738
01:43:23.321 --> 01:43:26.930
but he's a Brazilian guy.
It doesn't match because it doesn't Brazilian accent.

1739
01:43:26.931 --> 01:43:31.030
I was going to say houses,
Portuguese accent still African.

1740
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:35.380
But nonetheless,
you know,
on paper it might seem cool,

1741
01:43:35.381 --> 01:43:38.410
but it came up kind of cheesy.
I liked it though.
You know,

1742
01:43:38.411 --> 01:43:41.380
they over emphasize like all the things like he goes to the party and the

1743
01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:46.060
party's just Chris' name anyway.
Yeah,
look into it nonetheless.
Yes.

1744
01:43:46.061 --> 01:43:50.300
Science and art.
I dig it.
You kind of have to,
I mean back to the question yet,

1745
01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:54.320
I have to kind of wonder why the boss is asking your opinion too.

1746
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:57.080
Is it just a general probe?
Like,
hey,
how are you guys doing?

1747
01:43:57.081 --> 01:43:59.680
How's the Boston kind of like that?
Or is it,
well,

1748
01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:03.420
you have some concerns about your team leader.
What up,
you know,

1749
01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.500
kind of thing have,

1750
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:07.820
even though you gotta be careful because they could lead you down that path.

1751
01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:12.470
Maybe.
Maybe they're probing you.
Yeah.
Maybe the team leader said,
hey,

1752
01:44:12.471 --> 01:44:15.660
you know what?
I don't trust this guy.
See what he says about me.
Right.

1753
01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:19.220
And then you go in and you go,
Hey,
I've heard some bad things about this guy.

1754
01:44:19.221 --> 01:44:22.520
What do you think of him?
Yeah.
Tell you what,
you're right.
That guy is a dirt.

1755
01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:24.710
Yeah.
Turd with ears.

1756
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:32.560
Yeah.
You guys used to say that.
A lot of team,
they'd say Turd.
It's a team thing,

1757
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:35.750
I think.
I think it came from buds.
At some point it was,

1758
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.840
you'd get called turds quite a bit and then a person that was kind of maybe

1759
01:44:43.071 --> 01:44:46.490
just,
just not a very good individual would be a turn.
Yeah.
Years.

1760
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:53.030
Never heard them.
In Hawaii they say do two boy,
same thing.

1761
01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:55.010
Do you do boy doodle boy.
Yeah,

1762
01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:59.360
but obviously not in any kind of discipline where you got one more,

1763
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:04.520
one more question.
Yes.
Next question.
Last question.
Jocko.

1764
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:08.360
I've been disciplined,
working hard and staying focused,

1765
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:14.060
but I've hit a run of bad luck and I can't seem to get a break.

1766
01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:21.840
<v 0>Well,
first of all,
you are lucky</v>

1767
01:45:23.970 --> 01:45:27.480
because if you're capable of,

1768
01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:31.740
of working hard,
then that's a blessing.
That's luck.

1769
01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:38.580
Because there's people all over the world that don't have the ability for any

1770
01:45:39.871 --> 01:45:44.430
number of reasons.
Many of those reasons being just bad luck,

1771
01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.880
but they can't work.
So right out of the gate,

1772
01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:53.300
you're lucky that you can get up tomorrow and you can go to work.

1773
01:45:53.610 --> 01:45:56.640
Now you say you can't get a break

1774
01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.680
and maybe you're getting unlucky with your career or your personal life or your

1775
01:46:04.651 --> 01:46:07.710
business.
So

1776
01:46:09.450 --> 01:46:13.530
what are you going to do?
Are you going to give up?

1777
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:17.160
Are you gonna Surrender?

1778
01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:21.270
Are you going to assume that because you didn't catch a break today?

1779
01:46:21.450 --> 01:46:25.680
There's no way you'll catch one tomorrow or next week or next year.

1780
01:46:29.170 --> 01:46:33.100
Are you going to leave it all to chance

1781
01:46:35.410 --> 01:46:40.410
or are you going to do everything in your power to force lock your way to create

1782
01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:46.690
opportunity to,
to shift the hands of fate.

1783
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.420
<v 2>And even then if the break never comes,</v>

1784
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:58.230
even if you roll across the finish line of life,

1785
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:03.260
bruised and bloodied and empty handed from the fight,

1786
01:47:03.631 --> 01:47:08.390
at least you know,
you know

1787
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:13.540
that you went after it as hard as you could.

1788
01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:18.490
Thank you.
Gave life everything you had

1789
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:24.420
and you know in the end,

1790
01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:26.533
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1791
01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:31.070
<v 2>you might still be unlucky.
That could happen,</v>

1792
01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:36.370
but I would much rather be and unlucky soul.

1793
01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:37.810
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1794
01:47:37.810 --> 01:47:42.460
<v 2>that fought until the end and died with my sword in my hand.</v>

1795
01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:48.510
Then an unlucky soul that's submitted,

1796
01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:53.930
bowed down,
gave up and surrendered.

1797
01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.170
So stop waiting to get lucky.

1798
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:04.590
Stop waiting for a big break.
Instead,

1799
01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:10.340
be thankful,
truly thankful

1800
01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:13.410
for what you do have

1801
01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:21.060
and go out there and fight and battle and brawl to make your own luck

1802
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:29.220
and I think that's

1803
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:33.930
all I've got for tonight.

1804
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:40.590
So Echo.
Yes,
speaking of fighting hard.

1805
01:48:41.370 --> 01:48:42.203
Sure.

1806
01:48:42.570 --> 01:48:47.570
Is there anything you know about that can help us stay in the fight?

1807
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:52.260
Stay in the foot,
continue fighting heart check.
Sure.

1808
01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.870
First thing you need to do need to do is take care of your body habitus.

1809
01:48:59.770 --> 01:49:00.870
You use that word wrong,

1810
01:49:00.930 --> 01:49:05.880
but body habitus is like your like your habitat on your body.

1811
01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:08.910
Anyway.
Take care of your body is when I met

1812
01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:12.990
including but not limited to your joints.

1813
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:17.940
A lot more important than I thought from the beginning or at in the beginning,

1814
01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.370
so how you do that is Super Krill oil.
Jocko has super krill oil,
chocolates,

1815
01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:27.180
Krill oil called Super Krill oil,
another supplement called joint warfare.

1816
01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.550
These are good for your joints.
Don't neglect them.

1817
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:31.710
That's how you see it in the fight.
Straight out.

1818
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:35.460
Get them@originmain.com also,

1819
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:40.910
you want to increase your capacity and capability in the fight physically,

1820
01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:42.510
mentally.

1821
01:49:43.650 --> 01:49:48.040
You take new product called discipline.
It's called

1822
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:52.960
<v 1>discipline.
It's not discipline itself.
It's called discipline.</v>

1823
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:56.620
Anyways,
cognitive and physical enhancer,

1824
01:49:57.190 --> 01:50:00.610
force multiplier,
mental plus physical.

1825
01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:04.990
The the sum is greater than the parts

1826
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:09.970
anyway or didn't mean.com.
That's where you get them really good.

1827
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:12.460
They also have ease in rash guards there at origin.

1828
01:50:12.461 --> 01:50:16.810
Me and they are all made in America.
I don't know if you know this,

1829
01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:21.670
it's a big deal.
He does good work over there from the dirt to this shirt.

1830
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.650
Yeah.
Cotton.
It's even grown in America and that's very important.

1831
01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:31.690
Let's see what I did there.
Um,
yeah.
Keys,
rash guards,
compression gear,

1832
01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:37.090
pants,
compression pants,
spats all there also,

1833
01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:42.550
or just speaking of origin,
we have an immersion camp.
Jujitsu immersion camp.

1834
01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:47.800
All levels of Jujitsu are welcome to this by the way.
What about kids?

1835
01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:50.260
Kids will come to that one.
I don't think so.
Yeah.

1836
01:50:50.261 --> 01:50:53.590
Cause they have the capacity for kids there at camp shoot,

1837
01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:58.000
they're asking me that.
Interesting.
Nonetheless,

1838
01:50:58.210 --> 01:51:02.170
all levels,
even if you don't have any Jujitsu at all.
In fact,

1839
01:51:02.171 --> 01:51:04.920
last time there was a group who didn't have,

1840
01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:06.980
I think it was like some didn't have any duty,

1841
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
have no juice and it just came and went on.
Like you know,

1842
01:51:10.001 --> 01:51:12.580
like some of the stuff you learn if you don't have any juice,
it's like,
okay,

1843
01:51:12.581 --> 01:51:14.800
that's not going to fit into my knowledge because you have no knowledge.

1844
01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:18.060
So it's like,
no,
that's not,
I don't understand this quite yet.
You like,

1845
01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:22.090
we did the like the fundamentals class form.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

1846
01:51:22.091 --> 01:51:25.890
And even during,
um,
like while it was going on,
I,

1847
01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:28.750
I had a group on the site of like a good,

1848
01:51:28.751 --> 01:51:33.440
like 12 people and we're just doing just the basic materials.

1849
01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:38.320
No dancer.
Yeah,
for sure.
All Levels.
And by the way,
if you're a beginner,
yeah,

1850
01:51:38.321 --> 01:51:42.730
that's cool.
But also if you're good,
you'll also get some awesome training there.

1851
01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.530
Yeah.
Everybody great guys.
They're huge.
Good.
Cool.
Yeah,

1852
01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:52.640
it's up in Maine.
Echo Lake.
Are we on the Echo Lake?
December on

1853
01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:56.740
Echo Lake layers.
Echo has got his own.

1854
01:51:56.741 --> 01:52:01.130
Make sure echo park,
Echo Lake.
Dang.

1855
01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.310
Nonetheless.
Yeah.
So yeah,
origin main.com you can look in,

1856
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:07.540
see all that stuff and uh,
you know,
if you want something,
get something.

1857
01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:11.680
If you want to come to the emergency camp,
come to the immersion camp.

1858
01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:16.360
I'll be there.
Jacket.
You're going,
you're so mad.
Last time you couldn't do that.

1859
01:52:16.361 --> 01:52:21.300
Your Rib Rib,
rib was Jack and this year it won't be Jack.
No,

1860
01:52:21.301 --> 01:52:26.290

It's all good bro.
You're the man either way.
Also for fitness gear,

1861
01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:30.520
you want to vary up your workout.
You want to implement new movements?

1862
01:52:31.190 --> 01:52:35.620
Kettle bells.
Do you do kettle bells?
I know.
John,
can you do catapults?

1863
01:52:35.630 --> 01:52:40.390
I know that,
but that's the question.
Yeah,
you do Mike Grandchild,
right?

1864
01:52:40.630 --> 01:52:44.860
Mike,
this guy,
you know,
he's a brown belt or black belt.

1865
01:52:44.861 --> 01:52:49.430
I forget in Carlsbad area in who?

1866
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:51.620
I have known him for a long time.
I used to work with a sister.

1867
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.060
I don't even know if he remembers that,

1868
01:52:53.210 --> 01:52:56.060
but so watching you don't what you don't Jeff Clarkies.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1869
01:52:56.061 --> 01:52:59.850
So He's under him.
Um,
he hit me up.
He's like,
Hey,
I want to get into kettle bells.

1870
01:52:59.851 --> 01:53:03.620
No,
he's like,
I'm looking at the,
at ones or whatever.
You know,
asking the advice.

1871
01:53:03.621 --> 01:53:07.370
Here's the thing,
I'm not an expert on the kettle bells,
but I do know this.

1872
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:10.340
Don't get nuts with them,
but don't go too light either though.

1873
01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:14.330
I bought a kettle bell for my daughter.
She's five now,
so it's just,

1874
01:53:14.331 --> 01:53:17.060
it looks cool.
It's like the one of the little,
no,

1875
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:23.990
no man.
Anyway,
the smallest one,
but when I picked that up,
I'm like,

1876
01:53:23.991 --> 01:53:26.660
no matter what fitness level I'm at,
this isn't gonna do much for me,

1877
01:53:26.661 --> 01:53:31.610
so don't go too light is what I'm saying.
Yeah,
yeah.

1900
01:54:56.190 --> 01:55:00.410
Jocko,
looks like if you care,
you'll see what I look like if you care,

1901
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:04.010
which may be a little bit more of a thing because I apparently,

1902
01:55:04.011 --> 01:55:06.800
I don't sound how I look because still get that by the way.
Yeah,
no,

1903
01:55:06.801 --> 01:55:11.270
I just talked to a guy about the other day.
Yeah.
Yesterday.
That'll never go away.

1904
01:55:11.630 --> 01:55:14.570
Nope.
Until everyone has seen me.

1905
01:55:16.290 --> 01:55:17.720
No one sees me.
Anyway,

1906
01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:21.680
if you are interested in that youtube video version of this podcast,

1907
01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:22.820
also excerpts,

1908
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:27.350
take little chunks out of the podcast and post them so you can share them so

1909
01:55:27.351 --> 01:55:28.640
they don't have to listen to two and a half,

1910
01:55:28.641 --> 01:55:30.920
three hours of a whole podcast to get one lesson,

1911
01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:35.750
one specific lesson that's not a youtube channel and you just made a new video.

1912
01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:40.400
I did.
Yeah.
I'm making more videos now.
Time is running out.
Time is running out.

1913
01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:44.040
Those was an important one.
The,
you know,
so I'll

1914
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.710
<v 2>choose little excerpts or whatever to be like,
you know what,</v>

1915
01:55:46.711 --> 01:55:50.100
this one to me hit harder.

1916
01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:54.660
This little message that you said and now one was because it is one of those

1917
01:55:54.661 --> 01:55:56.880
ones because you know how the,
the old saying where it's like,
yeah,

1918
01:55:56.881 --> 01:56:00.240
we know we had to have a limited time on this earth but we don't have clay kid

1919
01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:03.900
thing.
You know that whole thing.
And really when you think about that,

1920
01:56:03.901 --> 01:56:07.140
that's more true than I think most people realize.
And you know,

1921
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:10.000
that's why people go through like midlife crisis,
right?
You know how they,

1922
01:56:10.001 --> 01:56:13.440
they hit a certain agent and get a corvette.
Yeah.
I gotta get,

1923
01:56:13.441 --> 01:56:16.800
I gotta get it back.
I don't know.
You know,
it's that scrambling situation.

1924
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:19.560
You know,
you're trying to scramble to get,
get more in,

1925
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:22.200
but you know there's gonna come a time you can't do that.

1926
01:56:22.290 --> 01:56:26.320
There's a little old school footage in there.
In that video.
Yeah.

1927
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:31.290
To of if you want to see me when I was,

1928
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:36.200
I don't know,
like 13 or 14 maybe.
Yeah.

1929
01:56:36.210 --> 01:56:39.930
I was probably 14 I'm going to guess 14 Bronson's children.

1930
01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.680
Bronson's children balance that Bronson staffing though.

1931
01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:46.080
Straight up it as you went through phases.
Right.

1932
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:50.790
Somebody else decided to identify fully the actual,
cause.

1933
01:56:50.791 --> 01:56:52.080
We had a bunch of different names.

1934
01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:56.100
One of the names of the band was rage of discipline,

1935
01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:01.560
rage,
rage of discipline.
It will never disciples of discipline,

1936
01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:03.880
not something else,
just one.

1937
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:08.850
It was rage of disciplined and it was,
it was struggle.

1938
01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:10.590
It was lock and load,

1939
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.400
which is really militaristic for someone that wasn't in the military to be like

1940
01:57:14.401 --> 01:57:17.700
my band's called lock and load.
I realize how cheesy that is now.

1941
01:57:18.170 --> 01:57:22.080
It's pretty dope action.
No,
I don't know.
But anyways,
range of disciplines.

1942
01:57:22.081 --> 01:57:25.800
Real mill,
military ish.
See Bri,
you are you even before.

1943
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:30.570
That's what the guy who got the video footage from Elgin James,
he,

1944
01:57:30.571 --> 01:57:32.060
when he comes on the podcast,
he's that guy.

1945
01:57:32.061 --> 01:57:35.640
I'm going to tell people I actually just a spoiler alert cause he's like,

1946
01:57:35.641 --> 01:57:39.450
I can't wait to tell everyone that you had a band called rage of discipline when

1947
01:57:39.451 --> 01:57:44.010
you were 14 years old and I was kind of laughing about that.

1948
01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:48.240
Yeah.
Yeah.
But you're in the making from the beginning.

1949
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:53.340
Yeah.
I guess you could say that,
but you know also I also look back and think,

1950
01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:56.970
well man,
I did some dumb stuff when I was a kid.
Yeah.

1951
01:57:57.030 --> 01:58:00.960
Well you didn't get a handle on the discipline to later,
but the seed was there,

1952
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:03.170
you know,
like a little rattlesnake.

1953
01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:05.970
You know how they say they're the most dangerous because they can't control the

1954
01:58:05.971 --> 01:58:09.420
venom.
They don't have the discipline.
Oh,
but didn't want the discipline.

1955
01:58:09.421 --> 01:58:12.330
That's what I think.
That's what I was like a little rattlesnake.
Yes.

1956
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:14.820
Interestingly.
Right.
Nonetheless,

1957
01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:18.050
you can see these videos on youtube where the video is a cool video.
Yeah.

1958
01:58:18.210 --> 01:58:22.650
Thanks John.
Good Job Echo Charles.
Thanks.
I'm trying to do more videos.

1959
01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:26.190
Also,
Jack was a store,
it's called Jocko store.

1960
01:58:26.191 --> 01:58:29.760
This is where you can get discipline equals freedom shirts.

1961
01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:34.590
There's that word again.
Discipline,
you know,
iconic one.

1962
01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:38.910
Also rash guards on their women's stuff,
on their hoodies,

1963
01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:41.980
on their beanies.
Here's the thing,

1964
01:58:41.981 --> 01:58:44.050
the green beanies out a little bit more of a process,

1965
01:58:44.230 --> 01:58:47.020
but they've been approved and you know there's going to be some beanies on.

1966
01:58:47.021 --> 01:58:50.920
Their new shirt is out just in time for summer.
Good job.

1967
01:58:52.530 --> 01:58:56.140
Even though they're,
you know,
they'll need them down in Australia.
New Zealand.

1968
01:58:56.230 --> 01:58:59.950
Yeah.
It was summertime down there and the southern hemisphere.
Yeah.

1969
01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:03.590
In Hawaii News.
You're wearing a new shirt today.
Sorry.

1970
01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:06.640
Is this out back to the book?
It's out.
It's out.

1971
01:59:06.670 --> 01:59:08.560
It's available because I didn't say anything.

1972
01:59:08.561 --> 01:59:12.010
I just kind of snuck it in there so some people got it live.

1973
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:16.360
It's life or in life or a day.
The book back to the book.

1974
01:59:16.450 --> 01:59:19.450
It's actually good.
The front of it.
It has a book on the back,

1975
01:59:19.451 --> 01:59:24.130
has all the titles that you've reviewed or took it on anyway.

1976
01:59:24.330 --> 01:59:27.940
You wanna see what that looks like.
Jocko,
store.com if you want something,

1977
01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:32.110
get something.
It's a good way to support also psychological warfare.

1978
01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:32.921
If you didn't know what that is.

1979
01:59:32.921 --> 01:59:37.921
It's an album with tracks that each track is engineered.

1980
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:40.480
It's not music tracks.

1981
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:44.740
Jocko tracks engineered to help you through any moment of weakness that you may

1982
01:59:44.741 --> 01:59:49.010
stumble upon or that might stumble upon you.
Actually,

1983
01:59:49.011 --> 01:59:50.230
you shouldn't say stumble upon you,

1984
01:59:50.231 --> 01:59:53.770
cause that kind of gives the ownership to like,
oh it happens to me.

1985
01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.790
You know what I mean?
If you hit weakness,
you hit the weakness like you,

1986
01:59:58.570 --> 02:00:01.570
you stumbled on the weakness.
You can't blame the weakness.
He blame.

1987
02:00:01.571 --> 02:00:02.404
You see what I'm saying?

1988
02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:06.370
So you need moment of weakness that you happened to stumble upon.

1989
02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:12.340
There's a track for that procrastination.
Waking up early,
the Diet stuff,

1990
02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:14.410
falling off the diet wagon.

1991
02:00:14.411 --> 02:00:16.300
You want to eat some donuts cause they're free at work.

1992
02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:18.160
It's wasteful if you don't eat them.

1993
02:00:18.161 --> 02:00:20.470
It's disrespectful to the person who bought them

1994
02:00:22.630 --> 02:00:25.870
and you're,
you're,
you're going to eat them.
That's weak.

1995
02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:31.090
Stay on the path and if you need a little spot psychological warfare,

1996
02:00:31.150 --> 02:00:34.870
you can get it on Itunes,
Amazon music,

1997
02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:39.150
various where we can purchase mp3s,
bump,
get it from their psychological warfare.

1998
02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:43.570
It's a good one.
Good way to support to by the wicker where support.
Also,

1999
02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:45.910
if you need some more support,

2000
02:00:45.970 --> 02:00:50.970
you can get Jocko white tea and I've got some bad news and good news,

2001
02:00:52.210 --> 02:00:55.060
bad news.
They've started testing for Jocko white tea,

2002
02:00:56.530 --> 02:00:58.390
so they started testing.
They're worried,
you know,

2003
02:00:58.391 --> 02:01:01.510
they see guys just dominating and they're thinking they're probably on Jocko

2004
02:01:01.511 --> 02:01:05.740
white tea.
The good thing that's a bad news,
good news is it doesn't matter.

2005
02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:09.460
Can't test for it all natural.
It's all natural.

2006
02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:14.730
No one can believe that at fully natural substance can can raise any human

2007
02:01:15.641 --> 02:01:19.540
beings.
Dead lift to 8,000 pound minimum,
but there it is.
There it is.
Factual,

2008
02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:23.350
factual
books.

2009
02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:26.830
All right books.
You can get some books way the warrior kid.

2010
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.830
This is the book for kids.
The book for kids.
See the feedback.

2011
02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:36.790
Go on,
go on social media,
go on Twitter,

2012
02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:39.800
go on Facebook,
you Baja and see

2013
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.110
<v 0>kids studying.
See kids doing pull ups,
see kids doing Jujitsu,</v>

2014
02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:48.560
see kids getting after it.
That'll tell you right there.

2015
02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:50.240
So many parents have said,

2016
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:55.160
I can't believe my kid now wants to study as they post little pictures of kids

2017
02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:58.040
making math flashcards.
That's what I'm talking about.

2018
02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:02.870
Imagine if you get your kid to do math flashcards voluntarily.
Boom.

2019
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:04.190
So that's what I'm talking about.

2020
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:09.410
And now there's a way the warrior kid to Mark's mission in this book,

2021
02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:15.820
Uncle Jake teaches young mark and he really teaches the rest of us how to

2022
02:02:15.891 --> 02:02:20.870
control his temper,
how to work hard,
how to be frugal and smart with money.

2023
02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:24.800
There's a little entrepreneurial activity in the book.

2024
02:02:25.730 --> 02:02:29.060
He also learns how to take care of his gear.
He learns how to save his money.

2025
02:02:29.061 --> 02:02:33.050
He learns how to deal with insults and with verbal abuse,

2026
02:02:33.110 --> 02:02:36.500
and he learns to overcome his fear of failure.

2027
02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:41.480
That's a lot to learn in one book.
Yeah,
but it's there.

2028
02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:44.900
What are the lessons are there and is done in a simple,

2029
02:02:44.901 --> 02:02:47.300
clear way that only uncle Jake knows how to do.

2030
02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:52.160
And speed of entrepreneurial warrior kids.

2031
02:02:52.161 --> 02:02:56.060
Don't forget about Aiden young Aiden,
he's only 12 years old,

2032
02:02:56.061 --> 02:02:59.630
but he has a business.
He's making soap from goat milk,

2033
02:02:59.690 --> 02:03:04.140
from goats on his form that he's not just making any soap,
he's making good soap.

2034
02:03:04.141 --> 02:03:08.450
He's making Jockos soap.
You can order it at Irish,

2035
02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:12.110
Irish oaks ranch.com and the motto,

2036
02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:14.390
which I thought of not given aid and any credit for this,

2037
02:03:15.170 --> 02:03:19.670
he didn't think of this motto.
I thought of the motto.
The motto is stay clean.

2038
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:22.460
So yeah,
get yourself some Jocko soap.

2039
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:28.310
You can also get a book called the discipline equals freedom field manual.

2040
02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:33.080
And that's another book.
The feedback is awesome.
If feedback is awesome,

2041
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:38.360
people that get that book and they get on the path,

2042
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:41.600
they get stronger,
healthier,
smarter,
more disciplined,

2043
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:46.310
they're getting better and they live a better life.
And that's awesome to hear.

2044
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:50.360
So if you or someone you know,
needs,

2045
02:03:50.361 --> 02:03:55.361
know how to get on the path and stay on the bath path than the field manual is

2046
02:03:58.130 --> 02:04:02.240
for them and it will help them do just that.
And for the audio version,

2047
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:06.620
it's not on audible because then you can't have an album with tracks.

2048
02:04:06.710 --> 02:04:11.330
The audio version is on iTunes,
Amazon music,

2049
02:04:11.331 --> 02:04:16.190
Google play,
other MP three platforms.
So if you want the audio version,

2050
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:18.830
get that.
Also,

2051
02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:22.280
obviously there's a book called extreme ownership.

2052
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:25.280
It is combat leadership.

2053
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:28.040
These are the lessons that we learned in combat,

2054
02:04:28.041 --> 02:04:32.060
translated into leadership principles for business and life.
And you know what?

2055
02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:37.180
It's still on the Amazon charts right now is number 17 on all Amazon charts for

2056
02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:42.810
books read or something like that.
So yeah,
you got to dig.

2057
02:04:42.811 --> 02:04:47.811
That does still selling and and and also announcement just went over a million

2058
02:04:48.601 --> 02:04:52.290
copies sold.
Yeah.
Which is pretty legit.

2059
02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.490
So thanks everyone for doing that,
for buying some books and copies of books.

2060
02:04:56.491 --> 02:04:58.590
And by the way,
you don't sell a million copies of books.

2061
02:04:58.890 --> 02:05:03.890
I have a book on just hype and we didn't do it through paid advertising,

2062
02:05:03.931 --> 02:05:06.180
which I don't even know if you could do it through paid advertising,

2063
02:05:06.181 --> 02:05:08.250
the book sales because the word of mouth.

2064
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.980
So everyone that listens to this podcast buys the book,

2065
02:05:10.981 --> 02:05:13.080
spreads the word gets it for other people.

2066
02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:16.500
You're the reason that that book is selling so well still.

2067
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:21.750
So thank you all for spreading the word,

2068
02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:25.350
telling people,
get it for them,
get it for their team,

2069
02:05:25.530 --> 02:05:29.400
up and down the chain of command.
Extreme ownership.
Pick it up.

2070
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:33.060
Furthermore,
echelon front,

2071
02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:35.400
that's my leadership and management consulting company.

2072
02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:38.970
We solve problems through leadership.
That's what we do.

2073
02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:42.750
And that is how all problems get solved through leadership.

2074
02:05:44.070 --> 02:05:47.910
So it's me,
it's Leif Babin,
it's JP Denelle.
It's Dave Burke.

2075
02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:53.270
You can email info@echelonfrontdotcomoryoucangotothewebsiteechelonfront.com and

2076
02:05:56.011 --> 02:05:58.320
of course we are approaching the muster.

2077
02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:05.180
This is the most dynamic leadership comp France ever of all time tickets are

2078
02:06:09.451 --> 02:06:11.100
selling.
Uh,
we,

2079
02:06:11.101 --> 02:06:16.101
we've already kind of expanded the floor in the location that we have in DC as

2080
02:06:16.681 --> 02:06:18.870
much as we can to accommodate more people.

2081
02:06:19.110 --> 02:06:23.760
But I'm telling you it's gonna sell out.
We're only doing two masters this year.

2082
02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:26.310
One is in Washington DC,

2083
02:06:26.311 --> 02:06:30.930
May 17th and 18th and one is in San Francisco,
October 17th and 18th.

2084
02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:36.060
So calm,
learn,
hang out,
get your pragmatic leadership skills.

2085
02:06:38.130 --> 02:06:40.500
And also it's important to know that there is no green room,

2086
02:06:40.590 --> 02:06:44.850
there's no backstage.
We'll be there hanging out,
answering questions,
talking,

2087
02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:45.713
eating,

2088
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:50.160
working out and hanging out with everyone that shows up.

2089
02:06:50.161 --> 02:06:51.510
So join us there.

2090
02:06:52.650 --> 02:06:57.650
You can register@extremeownershipdotcomandalsoonextremeownership.com there's a

2091
02:06:58.621 --> 02:07:02.220
document that we put together.
So some people,

2092
02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:04.530
they want to come to the conference,
they need to run it up,

2093
02:07:04.531 --> 02:07:08.060
their chain of command,
and they kind of say,
well,

2094
02:07:08.061 --> 02:07:09.360
what should I say up my chain of command?

2095
02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:12.300
I want my chain of command them to pay for it,
which is awesome.

2096
02:07:12.630 --> 02:07:14.780
And the chain of command should pay for it because they're going to get back a,

2097
02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:19.440
a much better leader in their organization.
Uh,
but we put a document on there.

2098
02:07:19.441 --> 02:07:23.820
You can,
you can uh,
click on the link.
The,
the little,

2099
02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:26.830
what's that?
The little link,
I guess it's called a link.

2100
02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:30.750
It's called creating leaders at every level and that's also on extreme

2101
02:07:30.751 --> 02:07:32.400
ownership.com.
We'll see you there.

2102
02:07:32.430 --> 02:07:36.460
We'll see at the muster and until we do see you at the monster,

2103
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:41.490
you can find us interacting and conversing and cruising,

2104
02:07:42.610 --> 02:07:46.240
cruising on the interwebs,
on Twitter,

2105
02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:50.290
on Instagram and on Dat food.

2106
