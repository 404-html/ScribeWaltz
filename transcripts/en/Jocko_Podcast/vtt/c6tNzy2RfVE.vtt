00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.340
This is Jocko podcast number one 44 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.440
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.940
Good evening and a few episodes back.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.980
I referenced an interview that I had read with Colonel David Hackworth,

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.320
the author about face,
my,

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
my favorite book of all time check and it was actually on on podcast number one

7
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:29.301
42 and I referenced this interview and I said I'd cover it in the future on a

8
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.020
podcast.
So here we are,

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.470
one 40 for the interview is from pbs.org they had a show called people's century

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.300
and inside that show,
inside that series,
there was one part of it,

11
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.360
I guess it maybe it was an episode.
It was called the guerrilla war.

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.760
So we're going to take a look at that.

13
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.680
Also on top of that to expand on some of the topics,

14
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.110
I'm also going to take a look at a book called Vietnam Primer,

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
and it's,
it's a pretty cool book.
It's very tactical and when I say tactical,

16
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:07.170
I'm not talking about,

17
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.230
I'm talking actual tactical like it shows where you should put your security

18
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:13.920
elements while you're in Vietnam.

19
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.840
What's the best way to maneuver through the jungle in Vietnam?
It's very,

20
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:20.940
very specific to that kind of jungle fighting,

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.900
but there are definitely some topics in it that I wanted to pull out and that is

22
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:29.901
the book in about face when Hackworth is talking about working with Sla

23
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.960
Marshall,

24
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960
which we covered his book on one 42 he's talking about how we work with them and

25
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:41.340
they wrote when they got done with going in interviewing all these people,

26
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.610
they wrote the book Vietnam Primer and so I wanted to at least take a look at

27
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:47.490
that.

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.470
I probably won't cover it in any great depth on the podcast because it's so

29
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:57.140
tactical and it's very specific to that time and yeah,

30
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.810
maybe I'll cover it someday but cause you never know.
Well anyways,

31
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:05.670
there's definitely some things to get out of it that I want to look at and we'll

32
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:10.290
pull some of those up today.
But the basis is to look at this,

33
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.880
this interview with Hackworth and I think you're going to see it.

34
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.910
It takes a lot of stuff from about face and just really puts it in the clear cut

35
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
in the clear.
So here we go.
People,

36
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:27.810
century guerrilla,
guerrilla wars.

37
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.160
And this is the interview with David Hackworth from PBS.

38
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.470
What do you think the Viet Cong learn learned from mount?

39
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:39.960
Say Tone and Hackworth says,

40
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.240
I think the major thing was how a poor man fights a rich man.

41
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.240
How a war can be fought employing ancient rules,

42
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.840
first developed by Sun Tzu.
The need for patients,

43
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.640
the need for political motivation,

44
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.060
the need to fight a war of economy and how to employ all the rules of warfare.

45
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.830
So there you go.

46
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.850
That's a little way to start this thing off the need for patients.

47
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.490
The need for political motivation.
And he gets,

48
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.560
he gets into this and he talks a lot about,

49
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.490
talks a lot about the economy because that's something that you can lose track

50
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.930
of as a front line person.
But you need to think about it.
Uh,
next.

51
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.810
This is,
this is very interesting.

52
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:26.680
What lessons should the Americans have learned from the French defeat?

53
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.310
So the French got beaten Vietnam.
And here's what Hackworth says.
Well,

54
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.490
I think the major lesson they should have learned was that that war didn't

55
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.430
involve the security of France and the security of the United States.

56
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:44.110
It wasn't an issue either on a tactical level.
They didn't have an objective.

57
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.290
They didn't have an objective on a tactical lover.

58
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.010
So clearly the point is you have to have an objective.

59
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.373
He goes on.

60
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.610
The Americans should have studied the lessons of the French very closely and

61
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:02.260
taken something from them.
A correspondent once asked a general Westmoreland,

62
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.930
the American commanding general and architect of the war,

63
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.850
what he thought of how the French fought the war and was he studying the lessons

64
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:12.880
of the French.
He said,

65
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.730
why should I study the lessons of the French?

66
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.070
They haven't won a war since Napoleon.

67
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.640
This was the attitude of American total arrogance.

68
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.010
We didn't learn from the past.

69
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.510
We didn't learn from our own experience by going back to when we beat Britain in

70
00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:35.300
1776 at that time,

71
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.380
the British had argued that we didn't fight in formation such as there's a big

72
00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:40.460
block formation.

73
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.680
We didn't meet them in the open and fought and we fought like the Indians behind

74
00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:49.790
trees using concealment and cover and so on.
And a couple of hundred years later,

75
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.300
we had the British mentality towards fighting and we had forgotten the lessons

76
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.460
that we had taught the British.

77
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.930
That stinks,
doesn't it?
When that ego gets out of control,
you know,

78
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.880
can you think about the thing about that,

79
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:12.860
that quote from Westmoreland is awful.
Why should I study the lessons?

80
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.610
The French,
they hadn't won a war since Napoleon.
That's,
that's,

81
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.190
that's awful to read.
That is why.

82
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.580
That is why the,

83
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.590
the seals that when I was running training the seals that would get fired,

84
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.101
the leader,

85
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:35.450
the seals that would get fired for leadership problems or from leadership

86
00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:39.470
positions,
they would be getting fired because of that attitude right there.

87
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.560
They don't listen to anybody.
And,

88
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.040
and what's interesting about this Hackworth is actually saying the lose,

89
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.100
you should actually even listened to the loser.
Hmm.

90
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.640
Put that ego in check.
Next question.

91
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.640
Don't think that the United States tremendous fire power could have won the war.

92
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.430
<v 0>Hackworth.
The war could never have been one.</v>

94
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.650
In terms of the employment of firepower,

95
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.390
the solution to winning the war was to cause reform in the government to win the

96
00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:18.391
hearts and minds of the people to make the cause justifiable so that the people

97
00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:22.750
of the country,
we're willing to give up their lives.
This was not done.

98
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.140
You could have used all the fire power in the world.

99
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.610
All the technical ability that the US had to fight the enemy and you'd have

100
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:35.550
maybe one a temporary tactical respites that's,

101
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.660
that's important because you know something.
Sometimes you think yourself,

102
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.640
well if we just,
if we put enough bombs on them,
yeah,
well we can shut them down.

103
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.570
I mean short of nuking them.
But I think that's important.

104
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:50.530
He's saying you could maybe possibly win.
Cause I,
I think ourself,
yeah.

105
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:52.870
I mean if you've dropped enough bombs on people,
you know,
you can,

106
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.000
you can shut him down.
But he's saying you can,
you can win a tactical,

107
00:06:57.001 --> 00:07:01.750
a temporary tactical respites
back to the interview.

108
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.380
But we'd never won a war strategically unless we had people had the people join

109
00:07:07.751 --> 00:07:09.730
our side.
We'd,
I'm going to read that again,

110
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.440
but we'd never have won the war strategically unless we had the people on our

111
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:15.274
side.

112
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.900
The war was about the people and winning over their hearts and their minds and

113
00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:21.460
their allegiance to the host country.

114
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.540
The host country in Vietnam was made up of gangsters.

115
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.190
Next question,
but you weren't there as a soldier to win hearts and minds.

116
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.320
You were there strictly for military purposes,
Hackworth.

117
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.790
If you were a student of warfare,
if you were a student of warfare,
as I was,

118
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.910
you quickly realized that tactically we were not going to win the war and we had

119
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:50.460
to win the people.
And this is basically the same conclusion.
You know when I,

120
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.360
when I got to Iraq the second time and I saw the Intel reports and,

121
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.450
and saw that what we were doing was the capture kill missions and,

122
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.300
and I saw that they had as many targets.
They are always in Iraq,

123
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.330
2003 2004 and they had as many targets up on the wall in 2006 when I got back as

124
00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:15.520
they had,
when I left.
So that to me,
he said,
this is just the,
when is this?
Are we,

125
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.110
is this ever gonna stop?
It didn't look like it to me.

126
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.430
We had to do something different and that's when I read the counterinsurgency

127
00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:27.760
manual my second day on deployment or something like that and,

128
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.850
and figured out what he was saying right there.
He had it.

129
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:36.120
You had to take care of the people.
Next question.

130
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.090
So we're the efforts to resettle whole villages of Vietnamese a good way to

131
00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:46.590
fight this war,
Hackworth?
No,
because the Americans,
again,

132
00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:51.210
tried to impose their values on the country of Vietnam without understanding the

133
00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:53.100
culture and the religion of Vietnam.

134
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.580
It was a country made up of who were shipped ancestors frequently listen to

135
00:08:58.951 --> 00:08:59.820
this,
frequently,

136
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:03.420
people who had been moved from their homes would go through minefields to get

137
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:07.800
back to worship at the graves of their ancestors.
We didn't understand that.

138
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.620
We didn't understand what the Vietnamese culture was all about.

139
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

140
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.150
<v 0>So imagine that you just think you can just,</v>

141
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.830
you think you're just move people around.
Yeah,
no,
no,
actually you can't do that.

142
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.010
That that ground is holy to them.
That grant is where their family is.

143
00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:26.120
They have deep rooted ties and we didn't recognize that.

144
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.583
Next question.

145
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.060
What do you think was so particularly good about the Vietcong guerrilla
fighters?

146
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.280
What did you as a military man respect about them?
Most Hackworth,

147
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.870
I respected their dedication.
The fire in their belly.
They're great.

148
00:09:41.871 --> 00:09:43.610
Strong belief in freedom.

149
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.520
<v 0>So that's interesting because of course we're looking at them,</v>

151
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.360
we're looking at the Vietnamese thinking,
they're communist and there

152
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.470
we think we're fighting for our freedom.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
But,

153
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.430
and this is other,
this is

154
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.680
a fairly common opinion about Vietnam,

155
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.000
is that they just didn't want outsiders,

156
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.830
like they saw any outsiders.
We're,
we're imposing on their freedom.

157
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.580
So even if we were going to bring glorious democracy,

158
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.080
it wasn't their glorious democracy.
They didn't want it.
Yeah.

159
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.050
Back to the interview,
there's was a mission,

160
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.620
a complete dedication to winning independence for their country.

161
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.970
So there you have it.
So I respected them for,
for where they were coming from.

162
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.140
Maybe it was empathy.

163
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.230
My ancestors two or 300 years ago had fought for the British,
or sorry,

164
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.710
had fought the British.
What about their strategy and tactics?

165
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.010
Hackworth as fighters,

166
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.430
they were very fanatical and very dedicated.

167
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.140
They were like my paratroopers who were extraordinarily fine soldiers.

168
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.060
A soldier tends to respect a counterpart that's a heavyweight and they were

169
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:04.120
indeed heavyweights because of their devotion to the cause.

170
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.813
<v 1>Okay,</v>

171
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.763
<v 0>next question.</v>

172
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.960
A female gorilla leader said that sometimes when they shot in American soldier,

173
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.880
his comrades would come up to get the body and then they'd all burst into tears,

174
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.590
which she said was a wonderful opportunity to shoot them or to grab their

175
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:26.940
weapons.
Is that a fair comment,
Hackworth?

176
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.670
It's right on the mark.

177
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.190
The problem with Americans fighting that war was that as the war went on,

178
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.960
they lost leadership.

179
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.640
They lost their hardcore professional leaders.

180
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.680
A professional soldier does not go after wounded.
He leaves that to the medics,

181
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.170
but soldiers that are not well trained and not well disciplined by their leaders

182
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.070
tend to become more of a group of fraternity buddies who care very much for

183
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:01.300
their fallen comrade and who want to get him out of the line of fire.

184
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.171
In Vietnam,

185
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:06.640
it was known that the standard technique to use was to hit the first guy,

186
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.190
then take out anybody going after him.

187
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.120
That was how they'd add to their casualty list.

188
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.820
I've had my soldiers tell me that a guy might have been hit in the leg in a hot

189
00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:21.130
fire fight,
and his opponent,
Omi 10 or 15 feet away,

190
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.460
would be pointing at pointing his weapon at him,
giving him the finger,

191
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.330
doing all these things to tease him while he's waiting for someone to come out

192
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:32.050
and pull them away.
Then they could blow that guy away too.

193
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.990
Prioritize and execute.

194
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.660
You've got to know what the most important problem you've got,

195
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.300
and it's not the wounded guy,
it's the guy that's trying to kill you

196
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.110
and you gotta be able to,

197
00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:50.850
you got to train your guys to be able to overcome that emotional situation that

198
00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:52.830
they're going through because that's going to be the instinct.

199
00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:57.400
That's the human instinct.
Next question.

200
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.260
The Vietcong hid in the jungle,

201
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.380
but in the Mekong Delta there really isn't any jungle.

202
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.070
So where did the Vietcong hide?
I like this answer,

203
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.180
Hackworth.
Well,
they were hidden in the jungle.

204
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.310
That was always alongside the waterways,

205
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:15.970
which tended to be very thick and weld booby trapped out in front.

206
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.440
They were hidden by the people they hid in the waterways.

207
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:23.800
They would get underwater and take a read and put it above the water and breathe

208
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:28.120
through that.
Then surround themselves with a bit of floating Nepa grass.

209
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.190
They would dig caves under the waterways and then put a bit of read up to the

210
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:36.850
top and breathe through that.
They were very,
very cunning fighters.

211
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.833
Yeah,
that's,

212
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.510
that's like what you hear about in the movies,
right?

213
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.740
The little read breathing through.

214
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.760
Read and they actually doing that and he goes into that more here.

215
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:52.831
Next question.

216
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:56.980
Did you have any personal experience of finding Vietcong lurking under the water

217
00:13:56.981 --> 00:13:58.710
surface Hackworth?
Oh,

218
00:13:58.711 --> 00:14:02.220
commonly if we saw a bit of Nepa floating down a waterway,

219
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:07.050
a bit of jungle debris,
we fired out it in,
invariably it would turn red.

220
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.460
That meant there was that below was a Viet cong hanging onto the roots of the

221
00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:15.120
debris with a read going up to get air and we'd killed one enemy.

222
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.800
Once we located them,

223
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.610
I always took concertina wire and put it on both sides of the creek so they

224
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:23.220
couldn't float down.
They'd run into the wire.

225
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.100
I instructed my soldiers to fire it,
any foliage,

226
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.030
and in most cases there would be a Viet cong hanging on trying to get out.

227
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.710
They were simply the most skillful,
the most dedicated,

228
00:14:34.711 --> 00:14:38.910
the best opponent of struck,
you know,
almost 50 years of being around soldiers.

229
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.690
They're the best
question.

230
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.200
What other problems were unique in the Mekong Delta?

231
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.380
The problem in the Delta was not only the terrible conditions that prevailed

232
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:53.240
there,
but it was the impact it had.
On your soldiers.

233
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.400
I'm speaking now as an American.

234
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.730
We had terrible casualties from what we called immersion foot.

235
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.680
Immersion foot was the problem in world war one called trench foot.

236
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.840
After being in the water for a long time,

237
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.350
the feet would become very soft and the boot rubbing against the foot.

238
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:12.110
We become very abrasive.
Suddenly you've had it.

239
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:15.410
You'd have a hole in your foot the size of a bullet hole and suddenly you're a

240
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:16.400
lost soldier.

241
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

242
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.170
<v 0>We had to be,
you had to be very wary and take care of the feet.</v>

243
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.310
There was no place to sleep,
so you were in the water at night.

244
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.150
Your soldiers were in the water and you stayed miserable and wet.

245
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.600
My rule was that a unit could only stay in the field for five days.

246
00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:38.601
After five days of immersion foot set in so badly that a whole battalion of 800

247
00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:40.230
men could be laid up for weeks.

248
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.700
I got immersion foot one time.
Yeah,

249
00:15:45.701 --> 00:15:50.701
I got legit immersion foot and so I was doing a training exercise in,

250
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.640
it was added.
It was,
we were doing a training exercise,

251
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:02.660
doing a reconnaissance of an air field that was located around the swamp.

252
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.470
So I spent five or six days in this swamp and not the whole five or six days,

253
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:14.210
but,
uh,
a good amount of days.
And plus the days I wasn't in the swamp,

254
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:17.930
there was heavy rain,
so just my feet were wet for an extended period of time.

255
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:22.980
Actually on this particular training exercise when we were going into the field,

256
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.840
it was raining when we got in the field that started sleeping,
you know,
like,

257
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.470
like ice and that turned to snow.

258
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.290
And so it was right around,
you know,

259
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.590
and then in the day time it warmed up and it will turn back to rain.

260
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.170
But it was a pretty miserable six days.

261
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.340
But when I got out of the field and,
and quite frankly,

262
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:45.560
I didn't really understand the threat of immersion foot.

263
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.620
So I just kept my boots on probably almost the whole time.

264
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.540
And when I got out of my feet were really jacked up,
really jacked up.
I,

265
00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:53.121
as a matter of fact,

266
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:56.870
I was looking at some pictures just to see how bad I had it compared to how bad

267
00:16:56.871 --> 00:17:00.040
it can get.
I just looked at some pictures on,
you know,

268
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.530
on the Inter webs and my feet were jacked up.

269
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.310
Legit wa I mean obviously this is,

270
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.450
I mean I've never heard immersion foot,
but that's a common for the trench foot,

271
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:13.710
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's common knowledge,
right?
Yeah.

272
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.980
Cause remember Forrest Gump when he said that,
when he's like,
uh,
Lieutenant Dan,

273
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.950
when you met up with her coming to tell you things or whatever,

274
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:26.390
and one of them was keep your socks dry.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

275
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:30.590
So that's definitely a common thing.
Yeah.
But he's,
he talks about it a lot.

276
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.470
You've got to,
you got to inspect guy's feet,
make sure their feet are good to go.

277
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:38.330
Yeah.
When guys feet aren't good to go,
they're done.
You can't walk,

278
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.320
you're done.
But my feet from that immersion foot,
they were numb.

279
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.490
They were numb like dead.
What?
Cause it got cold or were it was the,

280
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.310
it was house is just the wetness.
Yeah.
Well,
it was cold.

281
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.690
It only snowed and it only was below freezing that first night.

282
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.800
And then it was a warmer,
but they were wet for a long time.
Yeah.

283
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.990
<v 2>That was when I was young.
And then when you take it really dumb,</v>

284
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.930
take off your shoes,
does it like does the pain set in the end or no,

285
00:18:04.931 --> 00:18:08.200
they were actually,
they went there.
They went.
Who didn't hurt at all?

286
00:18:08.201 --> 00:18:11.560
They did but they didn't hurt.
They hurt more when I got out of the field.

287
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.540
That's when they started to hurt.
Yeah,
they were actually numb.
Yeah,

288
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.510
because I mean the way I imagined it is like,

289
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.740
you know how I don't know you're in the pool or the bath or you know when you're

290
00:18:23.741 --> 00:18:28.150
a kid you in the bathroom like super and your following it all love uncle.
Yeah.

291
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.310
Prunes or whatever.
The prunes pruned up fee.

292
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.620
But as I think that times five days going like too far.
Yeah they,

293
00:18:35.621 --> 00:18:38.170
cause they seem kind of sensitive to when you think about it,
you know,

294
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.250
like all that kind of sensitive.

295
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.970
<v 0>So
next,
next question.
Why were you mad in the water?</v>

296
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.260
Why didn't they walk along the banks or along pathways between patty fields,

297
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.183
Hackworth.

298
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.870
You could expect any dry surface was mined to booby trapped and 60% of all

299
00:18:56.871 --> 00:19:00.320
casualties we had in Vietnam came from mines and booby traps laid.

300
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:06.010
I might add by those local gorillas who the generals at the top Westmoreland and

301
00:19:07.221 --> 00:19:12.000
assistance didn't count.
So he's saying the local gorillas,

302
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.200
they talk about how the,
the the generals like Westmoreland would say,
Oh,

303
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.130
you know,

304
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.300
there's this many people and they wouldn't count the local populous or these

305
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:23.970
local gorillas as insurgents

306
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.873
continuing.

307
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.200
They didn't believe that they were the enemy because their mentality was a world

308
00:19:31.201 --> 00:19:34.650
war two mentality.
They didn't understand the nature of the war.

309
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:39.210
They were re fighting World War Two and they thought they could win the war by

310
00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:40.640
applying heavy fire power.

311
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.550
The outpourings of Detroit and great technological ability.

312
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.860
They thought they would steam roll this opponent into defeat.

313
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:54.370
They found that a war could not be won with bulldozers against somebody fighting

314
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.570
with great cause.

315
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.040
Next question,

316
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.080
but after the Tet offensive didn't the heavy bombing raids actually take a very

317
00:20:05.081 --> 00:20:09.550
heavy toll on the Vietcong Hackworth?
Well,

318
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.880
General Lemay said,
if I had enough bombs,

319
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.260
I could win this war because I'd blast the Vietnamese back to the stone age.

320
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.710
What he didn't understand was that the Vietnamese were already living in the

321
00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:27.330
stone age and that firepower wouldn't work under those circumstances.

322
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.720
I do think you're correct that at the end of Tet 1968 February,

323
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.280
1968 we increased the amount of bomb tonage out of frustration Vietnam as a

324
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:41.830
country about the size of California in terms of area.

325
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.810
We used three times the amount of bombs and the Vietnam war as we did in all of

326
00:20:46.811 --> 00:20:51.310
world two,
both the allies and the axis.

327
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.070
How's that for just completely insane.

328
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.620
We put enough steel on that California size target to sync it and it did not

329
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:03.160
cause the opponent to give in fire.
Power was not the answer.

330
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.390
The answer was to win the hearts and minds of the people.
Question,

331
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.210
why didn't fire power work Hackworth?
Well,

332
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.010
what firepower did using pursuit aircraft fighter aircraft,

333
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:18.250
fighter bombers,
artillery,
mortar,
and so on.

334
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:22.960
What it did was it galvanized the opponent.
It puts steel in their back.

335
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.650
They could see themselves being struck by a giant and they had no way,

336
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:31.651
no recourse to strike back it as it did historically with the British in World

337
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.960
War II.
It put fire in their belly.

338
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.020
It was absolutely the worst thing we could do in Vietnam.

339
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:40.390
It gave them a tonic to fight harder.

340
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.580
So we've covered that on the podcast about how the Brits,

341
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.860
when the Brits got bombed,

342
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:53.190
psychologically it made them tougher because there's something happening.

343
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.820
This,
this massive attack comes will,
it seems like a massive attack.

344
00:21:57.821 --> 00:21:59.830
It's something you can't control,
something you can't fight back.

345
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.970
But when you bomb a city of a million people,

346
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:07.750
there's actually a small number of that get that actually get impacted by it.

347
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.630
So everyone else goes,
hey,
we can survive this.

348
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.270
And so that's what happened with the Vietnamese.
They are,

349
00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:15.800
you drop these giant bombs on us.
Guess what?
I'm still here.
Yeah,

350
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.320
you can't do anything to me.
America,
Big America.
With your big bombs.
I'm still,

351
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:22.210
I'm still right here.
What do you got?

352
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.613
<v 1>Hm hmm.</v>

353
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.300
<v 0>Now I'll tell you what if the recent fighting in,</v>

354
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.540
in Iraq against Isis,
there's been a lot of bombing in the bombing has been,

355
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.220
let's just say it was a very,
very productive,
very,

356
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:46.300
very productive and,
and they killed a lot,
a lot,

357
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.720
thousands and tens of thousands of,
of Isis fighters.

358
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.370
And even with that being said,
there was ground forces that had to move in.

359
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:56.320
But man,
they did it.
A lot of devastating,

360
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.660
devastating destruction of the Emmy with that stuff.

361
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:03.990
So I think in certain situations you can have a massive impact with firepower.

362
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.030
Yeah.
But isn't that like,
like you said,

363
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.800
like isn't that like because of intelligence that they had and stuff like that,

364
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.010
there was more more to it than just hey,
let's just,
yeah,
yeah,

365
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:19.470
I'm sure a bunch of [inaudible] and the Isis were easier targets and not like

366
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.040
not only easier targets but better weapon tree.
Cause man,

367
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:24.880
if you look at the number,

368
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.210
like I remember reading something about a bridge that they were trying to take

369
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:33.040
out in Vietnam and they been launched mission after mission after mission after

370
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:35.920
mission.
Him dropped bomb after bomb after Irma.
It's hard.

371
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:40.420
It was hard back then to to actually hit something like a bridge.

372
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.540
Gotcha.
Okay.
You know what I'm saying?
We'll have to get,

373
00:23:43.541 --> 00:23:47.060
we'll have to get Dave Burke on here.
Good.
Tilty yeah,
good deal Dave.

374
00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:50.570
We'll have to get him on here and,
and talk about how hard

375
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.780
<v 2>that is too with dumb bombs.
Cause you know what?
Everyone says smart bombs.</v>

376
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:55.430
Now those were down bombs.

377
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:59.530
You had to basically you've got to eyeball it and I call a mistake.

378
00:23:59.531 --> 00:24:02.180
Can you imagine how hard that is?
Like okay,
we get that.

379
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:05.870
If you just want to bomb this general,
this city,
right?

380
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:08.120
You can just drop bombs on the city.
Okay,
I get you can hit that,

381
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.170
but you're trying to hit a bridge.
Can you imagine how hard that's got to be?

382
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.280
Yeah,
I do.
Because I used to play this game called Mario Kart.
Right?

383
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.800
So it's like a split split screen and it's the track and you get these weapons,

384
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.590
right and you're playing your friend who's sitting right next to you cause it's

385
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:23.900
a split screen and you can pick up these weapons.

386
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.890
So two of the weapons where the turtle Shell is the red one and a green one.

387
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.120
The red one was a smart turtle shell it like seek the other guy out.

388
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.090
But the green one just went in the exact direction that you shut it.

389
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:37.310
So imagine you're on a track,

390
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:40.310
you're taking turns just way harder with a green shell,
you know.

391
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.240
So back in Vietnam was the green shell.
Nowadays we've got the red shoe.

392
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.190
You pretty much fully understand this flu.
It's the same

393
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:54.330
<v 0>check.
All right.
With that,
we'll go back to the interview.
Next question.</v>

394
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.330
When you were active in the Mekong Delta,

395
00:24:57.331 --> 00:25:00.540
was it difficult to tell who was Viet Cong and who was civilian Hackworth?

396
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:05.990
I was in the ninth division and our commander was General Julian [inaudible] who

397
00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:09.510
was called the butcher of the delta.

398
00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.700
The policy of the division was that it didn't matter if it moved,
shoot it.

399
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.500
And then count it.
Theoretically,

400
00:25:16.501 --> 00:25:19.620
civilians were supposed to be away from the battle area.

401
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:24.360
They would say this as they would say this is a free fire zone,

402
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.680
but without realizing the tradition of the people to go back to their homestead.

403
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.450
So regardless of the danger,

404
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.740
they would go back to where their ancestors were and then they were considered

405
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.420
Vietcong and fair game.

406
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.230
There were an enormous number of casualties who were civilians,

407
00:25:40.231 --> 00:25:43.980
but all the civilians you have to understand we're sympathetic.

408
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.760
Certainly in my part of the delta to the Vietcong effort,

409
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.900
most of the people in the rural areas of Vietnam were sympathetic to the Viet

410
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.190
Cong cause they had won the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people.

411
00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.200
They felt that their cause was more just,
it had a more nationalistic purpose

412
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.893
question.

413
00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.380
You will once flying in a helicopter over the Delta and you saw some people

414
00:26:07.381 --> 00:26:10.980
running along and you fought their civilians,
they're children Hackworth.
Yes.

415
00:26:10.981 --> 00:26:13.410
One day we were doing what's called Eagle flies,

416
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.140
which is a platoon of infantry helicopters,
five,

417
00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:19.770
six soldiers per helicopter and I was controlling everything in a command and

418
00:26:19.771 --> 00:26:20.880
control helicopter.

419
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.440
The pilot in the front seat of my helicopter said that there are four enemies

420
00:26:25.441 --> 00:26:29.460
streaking across the field request permission to fire as commander.

421
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.990
I would grant that permission.
I looked down and I saw four little kids,

422
00:26:33.991 --> 00:26:36.060
so I said negative.
Those are little kids.

423
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.790
They're just playing hooky from school or something.
Leave them alone,

424
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:43.650
and I went ahead and inserted my platoon and let them maneuver through area.

425
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.570
Suddenly they took fire from those poor little kids who were probably no more

426
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:51.300
than 12 or 13 years old and it stashed there.

427
00:26:51.301 --> 00:26:54.570
Ak 47 so I was wrong.

428
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.110
My previous experience had been up in the highlands.

429
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.270
That was one of my first days in the delta and I was learning that just about

430
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:07.230
anybody in that battlefield.
Sadly enough was a hostel

431
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:15.450
question.
Were they ever helpful to you?
Hackworth?
Again,
he hits it here.

432
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.970
60% of all casualties,

433
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.690
60% of all US casualties during that war for from mines and booby traps that

434
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:28.800
were set out by these local people who had built them and installed them.

435
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:29.880
Ironically enough,

436
00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:33.540
the top generals never counted those people as part of the enemy's order of

437
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:37.110
battle.
Even though they accounted for about 300,000 people,

438
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.650
they were conveniently dropped from the rolls.

439
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:46.490
They were only counted when they were found dead going into any battle area.

440
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:48.060
If we picked up a civilian,

441
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.140
he became our point man against the Geneva Convention.

442
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.530
The assumption was that if this cat lived here,

443
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.310
he knew how to get through this area without losing a leg or a life.

444
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:04.260
He could lead our forces through.
So that's,
again,

445
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.980
we've covered this a bunch,
but the local populace,
there's,

446
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.070
they're walking through these triple down these trails every single day,

447
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:13.560
and they're not hitting any booby traps.
And then you lose a guy today,

448
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:17.040
you lose a guy tomorrow.
Eventually you realize that they add a minimum.

449
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:19.850
They know where these booby traps are at Hackworth saying there,

450
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.730
they're the ones that set them up,
made them,
and set them up.
Oh yeah.

451
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.530
So it mentioned against the Geneva Convention to grab a civilian.
So they're,

452
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.320
they're sort of grabbing them in what?
Forcing them it.
Like,
Hey,

453
00:28:31.321 --> 00:28:33.800
you're going to walk.
Yeah.
Like you're going to walk out in front.

454
00:28:33.801 --> 00:28:37.270
You're going to take us through this.
This trail.
Like a Husky.
Yeah.

455
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.760
Almost like a hostage of source.
Yeah.

456
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.570
Next question.
What was a simple booby trap?
Well,

457
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:47.370
the Punji stake was a no brainer.

458
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.060
Normally they were set in a position where they would strike your ankle.

459
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.420
It would scratch you.
You are in filthy water.
You'd get an infection.

460
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.290
I had a pungy wounded and I didn't know it.

461
00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.680
I must have got it in the morning and it bled a lot.

462
00:28:58.681 --> 00:29:01.320
I didn't know until I got out of the water and looked at my boot and it was

463
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:02.610
soaking read from blood.

464
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:07.170
There was a wound that looked very much like as if someone had taken a razor and

465
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:11.490
made about a three inch long slash in my leg,
it became infected.

466
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:14.880
That was the problem.
It wasn't a long term wound.

467
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.240
It was something that put you down for a few days.
It had to be cleaned out,

468
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.180
debrided than it would be stitched up and you were fine.

469
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.670
The real killer was the coffee can filled with explosives from a dud,

470
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.960
American round.
Everything they used,
we gave them,

471
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:36.030
we threw away our c ration cans.
We threw away our used batteries.

472
00:29:36.031 --> 00:29:40.770
We through where coffee cans.
If a 500 pound bomb didn't explode,

473
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.960
that provided them with a raw materials for their booby traps,

474
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.430
so they set up their booby trap factory.
They opened up the mine.

475
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.840
They took out the explosives,

476
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:54.220
packed it in a can wrapped barbed wire and nails and other things around it.

477
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.070
Got a primer device from a grenade that was left behind,

478
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.010
put a trip wire on it and set it on the side of the road.

479
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.230
When the first soldier hit it,

480
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.310
he would lose his life and maybe three or four people behind them would be down.

481
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.090
I've seen what we call number 10 cans.

482
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:14.500
The large cans packed full of [inaudible] and so filled with nails to have a

483
00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:17.830
fragment effect that it could take down 10 or 12 people.

484
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:24.870
The impact on the soldier was a psychological impact that every time you put

485
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:26.374
your foot down,

486
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.760
you didn't know whether you're going to have a leg or a limb or a life.

487
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.820
Then this played over and over for 365 days of going down trails,

488
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.740
going down waterways.
It took the fight out of you.

489
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.550
I took over the battalion down at the delta.

490
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.390
It was called the hard luck battalion in six months before I took it over.

491
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:54.250
It had 600 casualties,
killed and wounded all from mines and booby traps.

492
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.320
It had never met the enemy.

493
00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:02.870
It was all from these insidious little devices put down by these people that the

494
00:31:02.871 --> 00:31:07.130
generals didn't count because they didn't understand the nature of the war.

495
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.320
Yeah,
and I think,

496
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:17.350
I think the numbers for Iraq was 75% of the casualties or from IED.

497
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.440
Yeah,
75% off to confirm that,
but whatever it was,
it's a huge number.

498
00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:25.970
It's a huge number.

499
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.580
It must be an odd feeling to find that,
you know,
like Dang.

500
00:31:31.581 --> 00:31:33.550
They meet that bomb out of our stuff.
Like,

501
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.210
especially at first when he used to it.
It's different like you're like,

502
00:31:38.211 --> 00:31:42.020
what if you came across the results of Obama and it's like,
Dang,

503
00:31:42.021 --> 00:31:43.910
I was just using that coffee can,
you know,

504
00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.310
like two days ago or something like that.
Well,
yeah,

505
00:31:46.311 --> 00:31:50.020
that's why disciplined soldiers wouldn't leave anything behind ever.
Yeah.

506
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.540
But lack of disciplined soldiers would leave all the stuff behind.

507
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.850
Now sometimes you drop bombs and they don't detonate.

508
00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.890
That's so they can't really fault anyone for that.
But yeah,
coffee cans and they,

509
00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:05.030
they,
they,
they taught us when,
when I,
when I was going through training,

510
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.360
they taught us like we weren't allowed to leave anything behind.

511
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.860
Couldn't leave anything behind because we didn't want the enemy to use it.
Yeah.

512
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.530
It's a way.
It was.
And you know what the,
you know what the Iraqis,

513
00:32:15.531 --> 00:32:19.100
Iraqis did the same thing.
The insurgents,
I should say the insurgency in Iraq,

514
00:32:19.101 --> 00:32:21.260
they used old ordinance.

515
00:32:21.261 --> 00:32:26.030
Now some of the old ordinance that they used was actually from the old Iraqi

516
00:32:26.031 --> 00:32:30.320
army.
A lot of it,
but a lot of it was from unexploded ordinance,

517
00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:32.810
just like what the Vietnam Viet Cong used.
Yeah.

518
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.930
And even to me it kind of seemed like even if it wasn't stuff to use,

519
00:32:38.091 --> 00:32:39.980
like,
I mean man,
it's a

520
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.130
<v 2>spectrum.
Like some,
you know how like when you know,
in the movie where the crib,</v>

521
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:43.791
the crib and all,

522
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:46.430
they're chasing the criminal with the dogs in the criminal left part of his

523
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:49.070
shirt or something,
and then the dog sort of smells it.

524
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:52.520
It's like that feeling like your enemy has like something in yours,
right?

525
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.710
So he on one side of the spectrum is like,
okay,
they use it to make bombs,
right.

526
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.690
Which is kind of just maybe psychologically just kind of odd.

527
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.330
And then just the fact that for example,

528
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:06.620
like what if in Iraq you capture somebody or whatever and he has like a pair of

529
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:11.450
like some old army boots or something.
For sure buddy.
Well,

530
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:15.320
I'd say,
yeah,
that's,
that's uh,
I see it hitting you.

531
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.920
<v 0>I'm trying to figure out why this is kind of shocking to you.</v>

532
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.190
And it must be the first time you've ever thought about this.
Yeah.
Yeah.

533
00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.150
So for me,
yeah,
like for instance,
this was horrible.

534
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.520
So just think about this.

535
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:32.970
There was an element of snipers that got overrun in Ramadi.

536
00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.240
Hmm.
And so think about what the enemy got.

537
00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.440
Sniper weapons night vision.
God's always like you're horrified.

538
00:33:41.441 --> 00:33:45.610
Night Vision goggles and sniper weapons so that it takes what you were just

539
00:33:45.611 --> 00:33:48.100
talking about and multiplies it times a lot.

540
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:54.130
He's now the enemy has legitimate equipment that puts them a little bit higher

541
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.590
on the,
on the tactical level.

542
00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:01.990
So that's definitely scary and that's why we're so careful about never leaving

543
00:34:01.991 --> 00:34:03.310
anything behind.
Yeah.

544
00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.540
Next question.

545
00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:13.060
What did these sorts of casualties due to the morale of a more of American

546
00:34:13.061 --> 00:34:17.560
soldiers?
Hackworth just blew it away.
Just like a mine blew away a leg.

547
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.950
It just played with your mind.
Months after I left Vietnam,

548
00:34:20.951 --> 00:34:24.820
I found myself walking across an open field and I suddenly said,
where am I?

549
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.540
And froze in my mind,
I was in a minefield.

550
00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.170
It took a few minutes for me to work out that I was not in a minefield.

551
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.210
I believe that a lot of the so called Vietnam Stress Syndrome that has created

552
00:34:37.211 --> 00:34:41.800
so many walking wounded across America today is due to the damage caused long

553
00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:45.970
ago by what they saw of their mates going down by mines and booby traps.

554
00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:51.400
Remember of the 60,000 dead in 300,000 Americans wound in that war,

555
00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:55.300
60% were from mines and booby traps.
He driving that point home.

556
00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.670
The great irony was that the infancy stroller infantry soldiers who went to

557
00:35:00.671 --> 00:35:05.671
Vietnam received a total of five hours of training in mines and booby traps.

558
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:10.750
That was the curriculum used in World War II.
We simply didn't learn.

559
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.690
Yeah,
I can tell you they turned up by,
I mean,

560
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.390
when I was running training,
but we went crazy with IED,
like our,

561
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.470
our fake ids.
But yeah,
we would get nuts with them.

562
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.400
We put them all over the place and just,
you had to,

563
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:31.110
you had to figure it out.
What yet?
You had to be careful.
Yeah,

564
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.631
but I'll tell you man,

565
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:36.640
it is hard when someone's good at making those ids and camouflaging him.

566
00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.450
Scary.
Yeah.

567
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:44.430
We'd have to like brief the training cadre over and over again to make sure the

568
00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:47.190
training college,
I didn't set off the ids then we would be building

569
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:49.950
next.

570
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:54.930
What was the purpose of the Viet Cong tunnels in the sort of Coochie area north

571
00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:56.250
of Saigon,
Hackworth,

572
00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:59.910
the purpose of the tunnels to provide safe areas for supplies for their

573
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:01.680
headquarters and for their soldiers.

574
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:07.190
A great casualty producer for them was artillery air bombing and machine guns

575
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:09.120
strikes from aircraft and helicopters.

576
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.830
Most of the tunnels were located in areas that had great limestone formations.

577
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.340
It was easy to dig in,
but still quite strong and easy to shore up.

578
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.010
They could go down to three,

579
00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:24.600
four actual floors with pumped in air and brought in water.

580
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.460
It gave them a secure area that was really behind the American lines and the

581
00:36:29.461 --> 00:36:32.940
Americans never really worked out that they were there.
For example,

582
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:34.920
there was a place called the iron triangle.

583
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.910
There was a great number of such tunnels and a general named Williamson.

584
00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:41.880
Took a brigade in there and said,
the iron triangle is no more.

585
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.010
That was in 1965 at the beginning of the American involvement in the war when

586
00:36:47.011 --> 00:36:49.110
the north seas,
the country and they win.

587
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:53.760
When they won the war in 1975 their headquarters was in the iron triangle in

588
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:57.870
those very caves.
That's,

589
00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.000
that's like another situation.

590
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.810
You call this area secure and the enemy has actually has their headquarters

591
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:08.100
there.
Crazy.
Next question.

592
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:11.850
Wasn't it possible to block up the tunnels or gas them or blow them up?

593
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.940
Hackworth?
We try to,
everything possible to destroy the tunnels,

594
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.900
including having small soldiers called tunnel rats go down and try and clear

595
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:21.420
them,
but they were so cleverly done,

596
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.090
you can never find where the actual end was.

597
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.390
There would be a dead end with a hidden door going down to the next level.

598
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.350
I'm sure that if enough creativity and effort had gone into it,
then yes,

599
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:35.790
they could have been closed up,
but the top generals were not concerned.

600
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:37.110
And Anecdote,

601
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.070
a cave expert came to me between my tours in Vietnam and my office in the

602
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:43.950
Pentagon.
He said,
look,
I can help you win the war.

603
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.800
I can tell you where the caves are because this is something I've studied my

604
00:37:46.801 --> 00:37:51.760
whole life.
I took him to my boss,
a Vietnam veteran who is very excited about it.

605
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.440
We took them to our general and he didn't want to know about it.

606
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.360
Who wants to waste money?

607
00:37:57.361 --> 00:38:00.930
Sending this guy over there and have them examine tunnels and caves?

608
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.960
What's he going to tell us?
Again,

609
00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:06.510
it was the mentality that firepower will win the war,

610
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:11.460
these great outpourings of American industrial strength.
We'll win this war.

611
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.640
This arrogance didn't allow us to get beyond a blinkered military mindset.

612
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.500
Good advice for life and this,

613
00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:26.880
this is something that w with echelon front working with a lot of businesses,

614
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.990
sometimes your strategy is wrong and it was,
it wasn't the,

615
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.490
that's what happened in Iraq with us.

616
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.040
Your strategy was not working and it took us time to figure that

617
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.070
<v 2>out and start doing a counterinsurgency campaign,</v>

618
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.870
but I see this with businesses a lot too.

619
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.920
They're using some strategy and it's not working,

620
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:47.530
but maybe they used it 12 years ago.

621
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.250
Maybe they used it two years ago and it worked and,

622
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:53.350
and they were celebrated and now they're just going to do it harder.

623
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.180
Do the same strategy more.
Seems like that's the case with marketing.
You know,

624
00:38:58.181 --> 00:39:00.550
marketing just changes so much.
You know,

625
00:39:00.551 --> 00:39:05.530
like when you're marketed to the new strategy that it's not as obvious,

626
00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:08.830
but the old strategies,
you know,
like door to door salesman,
oh yeah.

627
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.760
Door to door salesman comes into your house now,
Bro,
you don't want to hear it.

628
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.130
But why did you even come to my house?
Well that's like,

629
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.670
wouldn't that be considered just a complete waste?
Cause you gotta Pay Some Kid,

630
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.310
whatever,
12 bucks an hour to go door to door,

631
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.390
whereas you can pay 12 bucks and send out a,
I don't know,
email or something.

632
00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:30.130
Yeah.
But even emails.
Yeah.
That's what's the new deal.
I Dunno.

633
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:34.690
Facebook ads know even that's kind of old now.
But,
um,
no,

634
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:37.480
door to door there was a time were door to door was dope.
You know,
it's funny,

635
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:40.650
as I still talk to people that will go out and make stuff happen door to door.

636
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.410
So now it's old school again.
Right?
The old schools coming back,
here's the thing,

637
00:39:44.411 --> 00:39:47.080
usually door to door,
it seems like a hard sell.

638
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.130
So He sure they'll make things happen,
but it's not as efficient as other ways.

639
00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:53.890
Like newer ways of marketing.
And these people come to my house,

640
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.980
door to door people.
They want to sell me stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.

641
00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.860
How many times have you bought zero.
Yeah.
So that's the point I'm trying to,

642
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:05.200
I'm like running through my mind to see if,
if that was unsolid answer,

643
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:06.311
I'm actually,

644
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:09.550
I'm actually pretty sure that in the last 20 years I bought zero from door to

645
00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:12.940
door salesman.
Right.
But,
and when,
and that's probably common where,

646
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.790
I mean consider the feeling you have when someone comes to you.

647
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.960
So there's some people that make money obviously.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

648
00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:21.880
And I'm not saying no one has seen these.

649
00:40:21.881 --> 00:40:24.520
I've worked with some companies where they do door to door sales,

650
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.680
but he got song,
good sales kits.
They're selling a good product and they're like,

651
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:33.820
okay,
we're going to get this out there.
Right?
So think on doors,
dig it.

652
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:38.880
But there was a time back in the day when Dora Dora was kind of the dope thing.

653
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.800
It's like,
Hey,
and when you think about it,

654
00:40:41.801 --> 00:40:44.680
it would make sense because door to door,
like back long time ago,

655
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.750
I remember people used to come over,
they just knocked on the door.

656
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.680
There wasn't cell phone or nothing like that.
If there were super courteous,

657
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:53.770
they call before they came,
but if that's your neighbor,
your friend or whatever,

658
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.270
people would knock on your door all the time.

659
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.530
Now people don't just show up at your door.
It's cool because they're lazy also.

660
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:04.750
I'm sorry the text.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying so,

661
00:41:04.751 --> 00:41:08.560
but back in the day,
door to door salesmen,
they were put it this way,

662
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.750
they weren't as unwelcome as they are now as a work.

663
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.690
There was more random people showing up at your house.

664
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.880
There's a bunch of reasons as what I'm saying,

665
00:41:15.881 --> 00:41:20.881
but the point is back in the day that marketing technique or that sales

666
00:41:21.161 --> 00:41:25.270
technique or whatever was was more effective than it is now.

667
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.090
I'm not saying it's a zero effective.
Not saying is way more,
you know,

668
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:30.610
because things change.
So if you're a company and you're like,
hey,

669
00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.160
I think door to door is the,
is the the way to go because

670
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.880
<v 0>back in,
you know,
75 and we were killing,
you know,
kind of thing.</v>

671
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.230
Well that was what's interesting.

672
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.890
So going back to Iraq and going away from door to door sales here for a moment,

673
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.050
that was what's interesting about the surge,

674
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:52.520
what was the surge was not just more people,
it was new strategy,

675
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.540
it was more counterinsurgency focused strategy.

676
00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:01.190
And luckily that we shifted that strategy because it wasn't going well up until

677
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:02.024
that point.

678
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.423
Next question.

679
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.500
But these tunnels were militarily significant workday Hackworth.

680
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:18.070
They were running sore from the beginning to the end and they were a very

681
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:21.530
powerful ally of the Vietcong question.

682
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.510
You were in the states at the time it happened,

683
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:28.220
but do you remember hearing about the Tet offensive in 1968 Hackworth when the

684
00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:31.130
tet offensive occurred in 1968 I was in the Pentagon.

685
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.040
A dear friend of mine was an aide to a very senior general,

686
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:38.210
so he was privy to a lot of information that we Indians didn't have,

687
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:43.220
meaning the lower ranking guys as opposed to the chief's Indians.

688
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.200
He came and whispered in my ear and he told me about the attack long before

689
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.960
hours,
before anyone in the press or public knew anything about it.

690
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.780
I was quite frankly shocked and heartbroken.

691
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:58.190
I had been convinced for two years at the Viet Cong were going to win the war,

692
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.400
that the Americans simply didn't understand the nature of the war.

693
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.630
It was very much epitomized.
When Walter Cronkite ask the American people,

694
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.780
what the Hell is going on here?
I thought we were winning the war.

695
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.800
That was the kind of shock it was to the American people.

696
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:18.040
Everyone had been fed these glowing after action reports by the president Lyndon

697
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:24.380
Johnson by General Westmoreland,
that there was light at the end of the tunnel,

698
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.480
that we were prevailing,
that it would only be a matter of months.

699
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.140
The American public was still oriented towards World War Two.

700
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.110
They were believing that as long as we grab this real estate,

701
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.780
we would eventually find the light at the end of the tunnel.

702
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:43.100
But the light at the end of the tunnel was a Viet cong freight train coming on

703
00:43:43.101 --> 00:43:43.934
full bore.

704
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.120
That's what we discovered in Tet of 1968 and that was the turning point of the

705
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:50.780
war.
The question,

706
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:55.010
why was it the turning point Hackworth tat was a turning point because it

707
00:43:55.011 --> 00:43:57.980
destroyed the will of the American people to support the war.

708
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.490
Both soldiers who were in the know realized that this was just the beginning of

709
00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:08.330
the end.
We saw that the American people switched off.

710
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.150
If the support of the people is not there,

711
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.490
you are going to be caught off at the legs.

712
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:16.730
And that's exactly what happened in Vietnam.

713
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.300
And this is when I was on that show,
on the history channel,

714
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.500
the warriors show,

715
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.160
and I talked about how you had to have the will to kill and the will to die and

716
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.650
to show about Mark Lee.
And that's,

717
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.860
that's where that quote that I,

718
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.040
that statement that I made is rooted in what I learned from Acworth.

719
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:42.000
That is you have to have this will,
you have to have the will and the people.

720
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:45.120
The nation has to have the will.
It's not just the military has to have the,

721
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:47.520
well yeah,
it's the people.
Cause what is,
what is the military?

722
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:48.840
The military is the people.

723
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.580
Back to the interview,

724
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:59.090
there had been a fair amount of support for the war until tet of 1968 people

725
00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:03.320
thought it would be unpatriotic not to hang in there and wait until we grab a

726
00:45:03.321 --> 00:45:05.100
noise.
When we,

727
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.850
when the people saw Vietcong climbing on the top of the American embassy,

728
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.830
they knew that they'd been lied to and they knew that this war was not winnable.

729
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.890
All they had to do is ask their sons.
By that time,

730
00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:20.640
I'm probably a million Americans had served in Vietnam and he'd come back home

731
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:23.340
and told their parents and loved ones the truth about the war.

732
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:28.350
The government couldn't just provide it with a Madison Avenue snow job.
Anymore

733
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.540
question.
Could the war have been one?

734
00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:33.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

735
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:36.290
<v 0>Could the Viet cong had been beaten Hackworth.</v>

736
00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:41.180
The war could not have been one unless the host country,
the Saigon government,

737
00:45:41.181 --> 00:45:42.560
the South Vietnamese changed.

738
00:45:42.561 --> 00:45:46.370
They're very repressive form of government and won the hearts and minds of the

739
00:45:46.371 --> 00:45:47.204
people.

740
00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:47.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

741
00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.460
<v 0>They're,</v>

742
00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.210
the northern government had employed this technique and they'd created the

743
00:45:52.211 --> 00:45:55.480
promise of this Utopian dream.
As soon as they kicked out the invader,

744
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.880
this repressive south Vietnamese government,

745
00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.780
the South Vietnamese government never understood why,

746
00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.930
what never understood that they had to make those changes.

747
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

748
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.690
<v 0>They were led by greedy people who were into making money.</v>

749
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.000
They had no contact with the people in the main,

750
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:16.830
they were mainly Catholics and they were into they and they were trying to rule

751
00:46:16.831 --> 00:46:18.870
a country that was 90% Buddhist

752
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.000
question.

753
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.530
Why was body counts so important or was it Hackworth?

754
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:31.000
Mcnamara was a number cruncher and he wanted to have something to crunch a

755
00:46:31.001 --> 00:46:31.834
number.

756
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.700
The overall strategy was attrition to wear out the enemy by counting bodies.

757
00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:40.180
We would know the impact of the war.
It's success or failure.

758
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:43.450
That became the standard measurement of success.

759
00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.080
It was the score and everyone wanted to know the score.

760
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.820
What really happened was the body count counting completely eroded the honor

761
00:46:51.821 --> 00:46:55.210
code of the military,
specifically among the officer corps,

762
00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.130
a top people to lie,

763
00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.900
the young fresh lieutenants out of the military academies,
we're taught to lie.

764
00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:05.830
The generals who were pretty proficient liars anyway,
push the body count.

765
00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.740
A high body count meant great success,

766
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.270
so in every battle enemy bodies were counted several times.

767
00:47:13.271 --> 00:47:14.350
If there were 200 bodies,

768
00:47:14.351 --> 00:47:18.580
suddenly the figure became 650 and it became to court with Westmoreland,

769
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.380
another great American victory.

770
00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:26.230
It corrupted the officer corps and appalled the soldiers who by that time were

771
00:47:26.231 --> 00:47:30.400
mostly draftees.
They were scurrying around jungle counting bodies,

772
00:47:30.401 --> 00:47:32.980
which was a pretty awesome and terrible thing to do.

773
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.850
It had a real boomerang effect on the military because it was like a cancer.

774
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.470
It destroyed its soul.

775
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.283
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

776
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.460
<v 0>What was the military strategy of the war?
Hackworth?</v>

777
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:56.870
Westmoreland's idea was to destroy the enemies large battle formations as in

778
00:47:56.871 --> 00:48:01.250
World War Two when you've worn the enemy down,
you've won on the field of battle.

779
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:05.750
That tells you that we simply didn't understand the nature of the war because

780
00:48:05.751 --> 00:48:08.000
the gorilla was not going to fight in that way.

781
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:11.720
The guerrillas manner of fighting was to hit and run so he could be alive to

782
00:48:11.721 --> 00:48:15.410
fight another day.
You wasn't into these huge standup battles.

783
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:20.090
Big operations required a great number of resources,
a great amount of logistics,

784
00:48:20.091 --> 00:48:23.120
a great amount of aircraft,
and a greater amount of artillery fire.

785
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

786
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.510
<v 0>Most Diane,
who is the chief of staff of these,
of the Israeli army,</v>

787
00:48:29.511 --> 00:48:33.380
came to Vietnam and I interviewed him right after he had spent two weeks with an

788
00:48:33.381 --> 00:48:35.810
American rifle company of about a hundred men.

789
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.460
He said that in one battle with the North Vietnamese force of a couple hundred

790
00:48:40.461 --> 00:48:44.570
men,
they fired more artillery over 25,000 rounds.

791
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.090
Then he had fired in a whole campaign.

792
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

793
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:53.210
<v 0>That was the American way of fighting a war.
It was also terribly expensive.</v>

794
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.780
Each round was $100.
If you fired 10,000 rounds,

795
00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:01.990
you've probably gone through $1 million in one 15 minute fight and you've killed

796
00:49:02.181 --> 00:49:06.310
seven enemy.
When you look at it from a cost basis,

797
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:10.240
we are paying an enormous amount to kill the enemy and we couldn't sustain that

798
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:14.290
kind of momentum and that kind of expenditure for a long time.

799
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.380
It was a failed tactic that never should have been used.

800
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:20.500
We should have used the same roles that Mao was teaching,

801
00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:25.501
that sun suit taught before to break up in smaller elements and fight fire with

802
00:49:25.661 --> 00:49:26.494
fire.

803
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:29.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

804
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.370
<v 0>Yeah.
You think about that economic,
you pay $1 million to kill</v>

805
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.130
seven enemy soldiers.
That's your,

806
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.650
it's not going to work out well in the long run.
No
question.

807
00:49:43.651 --> 00:49:47.700
Had you been in charge,
how would you have done things differently?
Hackworth.

808
00:49:47.701 --> 00:49:49.110
During my second year in Vietnam,

809
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:52.140
I commanded a battalion made up of conscripts down in the delta.

810
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.300
It was a battalion with very bad leadership.

811
00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.930
It is sustained 600 casualties in the six months before I took over,

812
00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.130
morale was low.

813
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:04.340
They called themselves the heartbreak battalion within 30 days they turned

814
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:06.120
around.
Of course,
we've covered this on steel,

815
00:50:06.121 --> 00:50:09.150
my soldiers hearts written by Hackworth about this experience and we also

816
00:50:09.151 --> 00:50:13.080
covered it in about face,
which he covers that as well about this experience,

817
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.860
so I'm moving a little bit quicker here.
We fought like gorillas.

818
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.780
We didn't fight in these huge formations.

819
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:22.410
We broke up and fought in small units of five or seven people.

820
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.040
We fought at night.
We stole the night from the enemy.
We ambushed.

821
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:30.180
We didn't march in formations and expect to meet an opponent marching in long

822
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:34.310
form marching and large formations.
We fought him using his very tactics,

823
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:37.820
his very skills.
We tore a page out of Mao's book.

824
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:42.620
The proof of the pudding was six months later that the battalion had only lost

825
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:44.150
25 American soldiers.

826
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:49.600
It had killed over 2,600 enemy soldiers and there were no Vietcong in the area

827
00:50:50.091 --> 00:50:50.960
of operation.

828
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:56.300
Those soldiers proudly called themselves the hardcore battalion and they were

829
00:50:56.301 --> 00:51:00.470
hardcore,
but they were simply simple draftees who didn't want to be their

830
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:06.200
question.
Are you sure that was an accurate about it?
Body count,
Hackworth.
Yeah,

831
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.210
I think that was an accurate body count.

832
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:12.530
Considering the inflated body count techniques employed by the US military at

833
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:16.850
the time question wasn't the fight cause it's a little ironic that he talks

834
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:21.470
about how bad the body count is and then he uses it so he's Kinda getting called

835
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:22.304
out on that a little bit.

836
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:26.120
He should have just stuck to the fact that there was no more Viet Cong

837
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:27.260
operations in that area.

838
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.440
There used to be x amount of an enemy attacks day and now there was zero.

839
00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:34.520
Sorry Hack.
Come on.
Don't worry.
I've got you.

840
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:42.730
Wasn't the fighting from 72 to 75 more like more like conventional warfare

841
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.190
Hackworth.
It was conventional warfare.

842
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.090
A guerrilla campaign starts with a few people who are dissatisfied.

843
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:51.800
They throw rocks at the enemy,

844
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:53.840
they finally kill an enemy soldier and get a rifle.

845
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:57.230
They get more rifles and they rate an armory and they get more weapons and they

846
00:51:57.231 --> 00:51:58.130
build and build up.

847
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:02.240
Phase one of a guerrilla campaign is individual sniping,

848
00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:07.010
laying booby traps and low scale conflict type fighting.
The final phase,

849
00:52:07.011 --> 00:52:12.011
the final goal in phase four or five is to move in brigades and divisions and

850
00:52:13.251 --> 00:52:17.780
cores.
In a conventional formation and that's the culmination of the war,

851
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:23.950
which is interesting to think about when it's like one of those situations where

852
00:52:24.081 --> 00:52:27.170
what made you strong,
you leave behind,
right?

853
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.570
It happens with companies all the time,
you know,
this company starts off,

854
00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:30.470
they're small,
they're nimble,

855
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:33.320
they can adapt to the market and then over time they get so big they can't

856
00:52:33.321 --> 00:52:33.770
change anymore.

857
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:37.820
And then some other company that was a startup is now a small and nimble and can

858
00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:41.090
take advantage of the,
the changes in the market.
Same thing happens

859
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.880
unless you pay attention,
unless you keep yourself mobile,

860
00:52:46.881 --> 00:52:51.770
unless you enact decentralized command,
you can prevent it.
You can keep,
if you,

861
00:52:51.771 --> 00:52:53.150
if you start to centralize everything,

862
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.060
what you have to get somewhat more centralized when you grow like that,

863
00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:01.190
like one thing is in the military you say,
well we've got decentralized command.

864
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:03.830
Well part of that,
part of the reason we have that we can,

865
00:53:03.831 --> 00:53:07.460
we can let people have decentralized command is because we have the discipline

866
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:11.330
training upfront,
right?
So once a company,
as a company grows,

867
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.370
if you put discipline on them,

868
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.640
you can allow them to still have decentralized command and act very quickly.

869
00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:22.090
You got to have trust in your subordinate leadership for sure to be able to

870
00:53:22.281 --> 00:53:25.710
employ that
next question,

871
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.460
but the actual defeat of the southern government was by the North Vietnamese

872
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:32.400
regular army that was hardly a Vietcong victory.

873
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.890
Was it Hackworth?
Oh,

874
00:53:34.891 --> 00:53:39.330
I think that the architect of that general tray was a Vietcong,

875
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.240
a southerner.
He was the one that planned it.

876
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.460
There were a number of Vietcong divisions.
For example,

877
00:53:44.461 --> 00:53:47.950
the Ninth Viet Cong division in the delta fought and the final battles as a

878
00:53:47.951 --> 00:53:51.840
regular unit.
Sure,
the majority were regular forces from the north,

879
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:55.200
but they fought in hit and run type operations.

880
00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:57.210
They always fought on the offensive.

881
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:02.690
That is interesting to note is that of 100% of all contacts,

882
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:08.030
when one guy attacks another 85% were enemy initiated.

883
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:11.040
That means that throughout the war,

884
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:15.930
the Americans were on the defensive 85% of the time and the enemy,

885
00:54:15.931 --> 00:54:19.320
the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese was on the offensive.

886
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.290
You can't win a war by being on the defense,

887
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.510
you have to have the offensive power.

888
00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.690
We didn't have the initiative throughout the war from beginning to end.

889
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.790
The initiative rested in the hands of the opponent,

890
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:33.930
the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese.
That's like,
um,

891
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:38.880
in Jujitsu when someone's just attacking and attacking and attacking,

892
00:54:38.881 --> 00:54:40.490
you're defending the whole time you're going down.
I mean,

893
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:45.420
eventually you're going down to mentally.
And that was something that,

894
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:50.450
that we definitely changed up in for my last deployment when we were in Ramadi

895
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:55.680
with task unit bruiser.
Whenever you're on patrol,

896
00:54:55.681 --> 00:54:57.540
you're on defensive,
you're on the defensive.

897
00:54:57.541 --> 00:55:00.960
But once you set up a little Overwatch position and you're waiting for the enemy

898
00:55:00.961 --> 00:55:04.410
patrol and now you're ambushing them.
So now you're on the offense.
So I mean,

899
00:55:04.411 --> 00:55:08.190
we weren't on offense 85% of the time,

900
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:10.800
but we were on offense a lot of the time.

901
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:15.810
The boys were getting out on offense and surprising the enemy on a regular

902
00:55:15.811 --> 00:55:17.010
basis.
I mean,

903
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:21.470
probably more than half the time because we were also doing things where we

904
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.070
definitely,
we were on the defensive.
I mean,

905
00:55:23.071 --> 00:55:25.990
it's authentic and defensive at the same time.
When you're pushing through,
uh,

906
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.740
when you're doing the clearance operation,
you're on offense,

907
00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:31.390
but you're on defense because you're the is waiting for you.
You know?

908
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.410
So there's a little dichotomy and doing that type of mission,

909
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.130
but like doing a direct action mission where you're going to go and take down a

910
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:40.620
building where you think there's a bad guy.

911
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.710
You're authentic when you get to that target,

912
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:47.850
but while you're going to the target,
you're waiting to get ambushed.

913
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:49.890
You're waiting to get ambushed.
That's what you're doing.

914
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.180
Even though you're scanning,

915
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:53.160
even though you're looking for threats or you're still waiting to get ambushed,

916
00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:54.420
you're waiting to roll over an ID.

917
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.630
So even though you feel like you're on offense and we train our guys to be an

918
00:55:57.631 --> 00:55:58.464
offense,

919
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:03.510
but the reality is the first shot in those situations is absolutely going to be

920
00:56:03.511 --> 00:56:06.750
fired by the enemy.
The ID is going to be initiated by the enemy.

921
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:10.970
Once you do the raid,
the raid itself,
that's us being on offense,
right,

922
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.670
right there in their sleeping or they're,
they're not expecting you to come.

923
00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:15.001
And Boom,

924
00:56:15.001 --> 00:56:17.820
you blow their door off and you enter their house and you're on offense.

925
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.300
That's like four minutes.
And so you were saying before that,

926
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.850
before that while you're going to the cause they like protected themselves with

927
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.170
whatever measures unrelated.
Like let's say you're going for a bad guy,

928
00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:31.660
bad guy x and he lives in the house.

929
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.530
You know you're going to get him and when you get there,

930
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.330
you're going to surprise him and he's not gonna be expecting you.

931
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.230
But on the way there,
bad guy,
z bad guy,

932
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:44.980
m and bad guy f have all set up ambushes on this road.

933
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.160
Not maybe completely disconnected with my ex,

934
00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:52.990
but you are going to have to go through the ambushes that they've set and,

935
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.200
and they don't care.
They'll set up that ambush tonight.
No one comes.
Okay,
cool.

936
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.480
We'll set up tomorrow night.
No one comes to,
we'll set up tomorrow night.

937
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:03.200
You want to got to go down that one road one time to get ambushed.
So you're on.

938
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.490
So when you're going,
when you're,
when you're moving through enemy territory,

939
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:11.550
you are on defense.
Yeah.
Again,
that's not the mindset we teach the mindset.

940
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.900
It's like we're on offense where we're going to go get some.

941
00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:18.580
The reality is the first shot is going to be most likely,

942
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:22.810
most likely fired by the enemy.
Most likely.

943
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.020
That's the way it is and you know we,
we did,

944
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.340
I mean these big clearance bees,
big sector clearance that we were doing,

945
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:36.200
the army was doing the marine corps to him,
like I said,
you're on offense.

946
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:38.560
It's an offense at push.
You're making the initiative,

947
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:42.850
you're taking the initiative and getting in there on a,
on a operational level,

948
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:47.110
on a tactical level,
most likely the enemy's going to see you first.

949
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:50.360
They're hidden.
They're hiding the two rooms deep in a building there.

950
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:53.410
They're waiting and they've got an ID buried in the road,

951
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.230
so so offensive.
It's kind of,

952
00:57:56.231 --> 00:58:01.231
when you think about it is just the like a mindset kind of mainly to begin with

953
00:58:01.271 --> 00:58:04.600
because it's so,
it's like a,
it's like a forward leaning mindset.

954
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:08.410
I think an offense means you often see is you strike first,
right?

955
00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.740
You have the initiative.
That's often when you have the initiative.

956
00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:14.510
That's often when you're reacting,
that's defense.

957
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:20.470
So like in your situation that you're like,
so if I punch you,
I was on offense,

958
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.030
right?
Yeah.
If you watch me,
I just,

959
00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.390
I was on defense.
So yours was like a pump,
you weren't punching.
Yeah.

960
00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:31.840
It's interesting.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,

961
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:36.841
it's hard to I guess really get the capture the actual how you would explain

962
00:58:37.241 --> 00:58:38.890
that.
I think the best I could do is what I just said.

963
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.190
Operationally you're on offense meaning we're pushing into your neighborhood.

964
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:46.900
Yeah.
So that's essentially what it's like this like this,
if you had a,
uh,

965
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:50.380
a bar,
you are the bouncer at a bar and I had a beef with you.

966
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:55.120
I showed up at your bar.
Right.
Right.
But once I get there and get in your face,

967
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:56.290
boom,
you crack me.

968
00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.760
You just went on offense or even better while I'm going to your bar,

969
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:03.520
one of your boys steps out of the alleyway.
Cause he was waiting for me.

970
00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:06.100
It cracks me with a bottle in the back of the head.
Right.

971
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:10.420
I want to be ready for be like you could somehow he got a whole nother thing you

972
00:59:10.421 --> 00:59:13.180
got to contend with.
So there's different orders.
They better kill me

973
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:19.900
or kill me you and deep into the earth scenario,
feminist Santa's cool.

974
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.130
There it is.
A bit of you

975
00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.350
try and be on offense.
Yeah.
That if you,

976
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.780
if you at least the lesson to be learned there for me,

977
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:34.340
if you're at least think about it,
right.
At least think about that.

978
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:38.510
You want to be on offense.
And that was what was nice about these,
you know,

979
00:59:38.511 --> 00:59:40.430
a lot of the missions that we did in Iraq,
I was like,

980
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:44.190
well you were surprising the enemy.
Yeah.
But if you can surprise the enemy,

981
00:59:44.191 --> 00:59:46.730
you're on office.
Yeah.
So yeah.

982
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:51.500
So like even like here you're looking back to your example,
your,
your missions.

983
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.550
Just the fact that you initiated that capture kill mission,

984
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.120
that's your offensive.
That's offensive movement.
Yeah.

985
00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:01.840
But just like when I'm coming to the bar,
I got to get to the bar,
right.

986
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.710
Defense when we're getting there because I don't know,
I'm going to get hit,

987
01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:06.780
right.
So it's like throwing a punch with that,
with that other hand up.

988
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:10.850
And it's important to note that we would teach our guys to have an office of

989
01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:12.080
mindset,
meaning when we,

990
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:16.640
when you saw one of our patrols on one of our vehicle patrols or a foot patrol,

991
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.430
ut every guy ready to engage the enemy.
Yeah,

992
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:25.640
most likely the first shot's going to come from,
did that happen all the time?
No.

993
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:29.840
There's sometimes we don't on a patrol guys would engage first or that that

994
01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:33.950
could happen,
but most likely that that's luck.
That's luck.

995
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:37.250
Because most likely the enemies a little bit smarter.
They're hiding in a,

996
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.350
you know,
when you're walking,
think about when you walked down the street,

997
01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:41.420
they got how many windows there are,
how many doors there are.

998
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:45.620
So now you just walked down the street and how many windows can you see?

999
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.060
200 300 right?
Yeah.
I mean if you're walking down a city street,

1000
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.430
you can see a hundred windows.

1001
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.930
Let's say one of those windows could have a bad guy that,
and you can't,

1002
01:00:56.931 --> 01:01:00.440
you're not going to see him.
He's going to see first.
Yeah.
So

1003
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.000
check next question.

1004
01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:07.760
In April of 1975 during the fall of Saigon,

1005
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:11.570
there were some memorable images of American helicopters taking off from the

1006
01:01:11.571 --> 01:01:15.050
roof of the American embassy and dozens of south Vietnamese trying to escape.

1007
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.040
What were your feelings when you saw those pictures?
Hackworth,

1008
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.390
I was heartbroken when I saw the end calm and the helicopters airlifting people

1009
01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:27.950
off the embassy.
But at the same time,
in 1971 when I left Vietnam,

1010
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.850
I said four years from now the north Vietnamese were fly a flag over this

1011
01:01:31.851 --> 01:01:34.310
capital.
The reason I said that,

1012
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.650
and I was dead on to the month was that I had been like a doctor feeling the

1013
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:42.800
pulse of a dying patient and it was obvious to me that this patient,

1014
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:47.840
the South Vietnamese government was on its way down.
Question,

1015
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:51.440
was the April,
1975 victory,
a victory for the,
uh,

1016
01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:54.170
people's style of war Hackworth.

1017
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:58.370
I think that the victory in Vietnam introduced a new phase of warfare where low

1018
01:01:58.371 --> 01:02:03.371
intensity conflict can eventually when questioned what was,

1019
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.310
what does the concept of a people's war mean to you?
Hackworth.

1020
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:12.430
It's the same thing that my forefathers employed in 1776 we wanted independence

1021
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:14.930
and we were willing to pay with our lives.

1022
01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:20.520
All people want to be free and if they have that anger inside them and the

1023
01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:24.150
ability to arm themselves and somebody comes along and says,
Hey,

1024
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:28.170
I'm your leader and I'm going to show you how to do this than the one guy who's

1025
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.630
trying to suppress them is in trouble.

1026
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:34.913
Question.

1027
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.360
What are the key lessons to be learned from the Viet Cong success?

1028
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.840
And actually before we go into that question,
if you think about,

1029
01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.890
you think about this from a leadership perspective,
we all wanted independence.

1030
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.270
We all want to be free.

1031
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:52.080
And if somebody comes along and tries to dictate to you how things are going to

1032
01:02:52.081 --> 01:02:56.250
be,
that person's in trouble,
right?
So as the leader,

1033
01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.620
if you try and impose your will on people,
look,
can you get away with it?
Yes.
Yes.

1034
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:05.250
Does it work?
If you're the,
you know,
if you can fire someone or yes,

1035
01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:06.960
but to be actually lead someone,

1036
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:10.200
you can't just try and impose your will on top of them.

1037
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.070
Need to get them in the game too.
Next question.

1038
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:19.190
How important was mass mobilization to the success of the Vietcong Hackworth?

1039
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:22.710
If you're going to fight a war today,

1040
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:24.720
you're going to need your whole nation behind you,

1041
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.740
either as fighters or supporters or carriers.

1042
01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:33.180
It's no longer the act of a few soldiers fighting on a sunny hill waving swords

1043
01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:37.530
at one another.
Warfare is now the employment of the complete population.

1044
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:42.210
The Vietcong took on two south super powers,
France and then the United States,

1045
01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.680
and they couldn't have done it on a shoe string.

1046
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:48.570
They needed to mobilize everything within their nation and they needed to get as

1047
01:03:48.571 --> 01:03:52.260
much outside support as possible.
At the end,

1048
01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:54.360
the war became almost a conventional war.

1049
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:57.330
One of the things that bothers me is that the Americans who are now trying to

1050
01:03:57.331 --> 01:04:01.350
rewrite history of what actually happened,
say we won all the battles,

1051
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.440
but we lost the war,
but we didn't win all the battles.

1052
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.350
We lost most of the battles.
This is really,

1053
01:04:07.351 --> 01:04:10.410
this is really critical and this is a very important thing to think about.

1054
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:14.400
The reason they've come up with this very bad rationale is because of the

1055
01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:19.401
American way of keeping score and the old American way of conventional warfare.

1056
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:22.200
If you're king of the mountain,
at the end of the day,
you've won the battle,

1057
01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.760
but to the Viet Cong,
it wasn't who held the ground.

1058
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.520
It was what kind of punishment you inflicted on your enemy.

1059
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:33.670
The Viet Cong and north Vietnamese were willing to pay an easier,

1060
01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.440
easy ratio of 10 no one.

1061
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.440
If you fought them and you lost one soldier and he lost 10 he walked away
saying,

1062
01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:42.550
I was the winner.

1063
01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:47.320
There's the mentality that you have to understand and that's why you have to be

1064
01:04:47.321 --> 01:04:50.560
willing to kill and you have to be willing to die for going to go to war.

1065
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.910
That's why right there.

1066
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.033
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1067
01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.720
<v 0>Question.
Can parallels be drawn between Afghanistan and Vietnam,</v>

1068
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:04.790
between the Vietcong war against the Americans and the mujahideen war success

1069
01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.310
against the Soviets Hackworth?
Absolutely.
There's no question that the,

1070
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:14.480
that there are sharp parallels between the Afghan war and the war in Vietnam,

1071
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.040
the fighters,
there were freedom fighters.

1072
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:21.040
They were trying to rid themselves of communism.

1073
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.740
They were supported by an outside country.
This time,

1074
01:05:23.741 --> 01:05:26.260
the USA who poured billions of dollars into that war,

1075
01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.090
they tried to win by using an enormous amount of firepower,

1076
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:31.330
said they being the Russians.

1077
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:34.660
The Russians tried to win by using an enormous amount of firepower,

1078
01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:38.230
conventional tactics against the search and destroy operation,

1079
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.000
a high degree of technology,

1080
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.180
all the mistakes that the Soviets made in Afghanistan,

1081
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.930
the Americans made in Vietnam and the French made in Indochina.

1082
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1083
01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:50.670
<v 0>No one looked back on the lessons learned.</v>

1084
01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:53.913
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1085
01:05:56.870 --> 01:06:00.590
<v 0>Did the Soviets learn to anything from America's experience in Vietnam?</v>

1086
01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:04.430
Hackworth?
From my analysis of the war,
I'd say very little.

1087
01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.330
They tried to win the war by using fire power by bombing them back to the stone

1088
01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:08.601
age,

1089
01:06:08.601 --> 01:06:12.230
through the use of American provided Stinger missiles and by mounting machine

1090
01:06:12.231 --> 01:06:14.420
guns in high mountains and firing down on aircraft.

1091
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.710
They made the price so heavy for the Soviets have in terms of costs that they

1092
01:06:18.711 --> 01:06:20.660
blinked first and got out

1093
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:22.110
<v 1>okay.</v>

1094
01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:26.340
<v 0>Again,
they used an incredible number of mines and booby traps,</v>

1095
01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:31.350
creating a great number of Soviet casualties.
The Soviet units did that did well.

1096
01:06:31.351 --> 01:06:36.270
There were special units led by people who understood that form of wealth

1097
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.133
warfare,

1098
01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:41.550
but their conventional infantry was exactly the same as the American

1099
01:06:41.551 --> 01:06:44.550
conventionally infantry in Vietnam or the French conventionally infantry in

1100
01:06:44.551 --> 01:06:47.210
Indochina.
Question,

1101
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.710
why did the Soviets failed to learn from the American and French mistakes?

1102
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.250
Hackworth?
I think it is a military mindset.

1103
01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:58.640
We don't want to go back and look at the past.

1104
01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:01.310
We're in such a hurry to get where we're going.

1105
01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:05.150
There's a certain amount of military arrogance.

1106
01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.040
The older I get,

1107
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.060
the more I realize how we never studied the past and try to learn from it.

1108
01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.910
We just stumble along and make the same mistakes.

1109
01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:20.140
We're doomed to do that until people wake up and with the military mind,

1110
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:22.790
I'm not sure we'll ever wake up.

1111
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:27.980
Got to keep your ego in check.

1112
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.800
Got to learn from the past hundred percent correct.

1113
01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:38.660
Question.
Is there anything about guerrilla warfare,
which is new to this century?

1114
01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:40.090
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1115
01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.830
<v 0>Hackworth.
Well,
a number of things are new.</v>

1116
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.850
The amount of fire power that the insurgent employees and uses the use of booby

1117
01:07:45.851 --> 01:07:49.390
traps and minds.
The ability to communicate via electronic communications.

1118
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:53.410
One of the problems that's always hampered the grill is getting the word out.

1119
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.560
In the days of old,
it was done by messengers,

1120
01:07:56.561 --> 01:08:01.480
which today's an hours today a general has very sharp communications out in

1121
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:05.800
Somalia general,
a deed had little portable radios to talk to his soldiers.

1122
01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:07.240
Very low frequency.

1123
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.590
The American's CIA's intercept devices are all high frequency.

1124
01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:15.910
They couldn't listen to what the man was saying.
They didn't learn a thing.

1125
01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:19.893
Question,

1126
01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:24.760
how frightened was the average American conscript faced with all these obstacles

1127
01:08:24.761 --> 01:08:29.030
and the skill of the enemy
Hackworth,

1128
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.500
the average American soldier going into battle in Vietnam carried a whole pack

1129
01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:38.090
full of fear,
mainly because he wasn't trained properly back in the states.

1130
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:42.920
The training base was just off.
They were preparing for World War II,

1131
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.840
not for insurgency warfare,

1132
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:48.740
so the lad received 16 weeks of training was flung into Vietnam,

1133
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:51.920
generally in a unit that was never kept together,

1134
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:56.420
but it was always filled up by the individual replacement system.

1135
01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:01.220
As a result,
there was no real strong cohesion,
no teamwork in the unit,

1136
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:06.380
and this is something that Sla Marshall talked about in men against fire.

1137
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:09.110
The soldier was like an orphan thrown into a family,

1138
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.340
but a family that was not solidly put together.
As a result,

1139
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:16.760
his fear level would be high because of the uncertainty of what he was going

1140
01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:21.500
into.
The typically,
the typical kid who went to Vietnam was black.

1141
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.540
21% of all soldiers were blocked and the Hispanics and the whites were from

1142
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:29.060
others.
The other side of the railroad tracks,

1143
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:33.590
if you went to a good university like Brown university or something,

1144
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.370
you'd find you didn't find yourself carrying an m 16 rifle in Vietnam.

1145
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.390
You did a Clinton,
you got out of the war.
It was very unfair.

1146
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.410
The poor working classes were the ones that carried out the war effort,

1147
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.090
but they're made of tough stuff because their whole life required tough stuff.

1148
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:55.160
Once they were provided with the leadership,
the proper leadership,

1149
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:58.040
that raw material did a hell of a job,

1150
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:02.680
but it didn't make the fear go away.

1151
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:06.760
When you're playing in that kind of a lethal super bowl,

1152
01:10:07.090 --> 01:10:10.720
the possibility of dying and coming home and a rubber bag is always lingering in

1153
01:10:10.721 --> 01:10:14.890
the back of your head.
Regardless of how courageous you are,

1154
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:16.630
you will still have fear,

1155
01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:21.760
but if you have competent leadership that you have confidence in and if you're

1156
01:10:21.761 --> 01:10:23.920
well trained,
you can get the job done.

1157
01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.250
It's my theory that the better trained you are,

1158
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:32.050
the more natural courage you have because you have a belief in yourself.

1159
01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.633
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1160
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.280
<v 0>That's all important stuff.
The better trained you are,</v>

1161
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:45.370
the more natural courage you have.
Keep that in mind.

1162
01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.960
Also,
the raw material,

1163
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.680
just give me some good leadership and we'll make something happen.

1164
01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1165
01:10:57.190 --> 01:11:01.510
<v 0>Continuing.
Our soldiers weren't well trained and in the main,</v>

1166
01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:05.200
they weren't well led,
but the longer the soldiers stayed there,

1167
01:11:05.201 --> 01:11:08.230
the more experienced he became and the more confident he became.

1168
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:12.010
The uncertainty was dispelled.
He knew what to expect,

1169
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:15.870
but the fear would never go away.
You know,

1170
01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:19.260
you can never go near a battlefield without having those butterflies in your

1171
01:11:19.261 --> 01:11:23.670
stomach.
Question,
what frightened your soldiers most?

1172
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.370
Hackworth.
I think it was the uncertainty.

1173
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.360
Once they got into a unit and knew they were well led,

1174
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.410
knew that their commander loved them and cared for them and would not throw them

1175
01:11:34.411 --> 01:11:37.020
into harm's way unless absolutely necessary.

1176
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.640
Their main fear was just that uncertainty that came from the mines and booby

1177
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:42.474
traps.

1178
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:44.120
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1179
01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.320
<v 0>and it's a psychological thing.
I've walked down trails and I've said to myself,</v>

1180
01:11:48.321 --> 01:11:52.280
a sniper has me in his sights.
You play those mind games with yourself.

1181
01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.390
I've had that kind of experience where I saw a guy where I saw a guy looking

1182
01:11:56.391 --> 01:12:00.830
through his rifle looking at me perfectly at what we call a six o'clock sight

1183
01:12:00.831 --> 01:12:04.820
picture and he's going to squeeze and you spot yourself going down.

1184
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:10.520
Good leadership dispels all those kinds of mind games.

1185
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.863
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1186
01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:14.723
<v 0>questioned.</v>

1187
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:19.320
There are all these images of American soldiers walking around smoking pot beads

1188
01:12:19.321 --> 01:12:21.180
around their neck singing rock songs.

1189
01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.870
Clearly the morale of the American troops broke down Hackworth.

1190
01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:30.000
The morale of the American army disintegrated the longer the war went on.

1191
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:35.910
We went there with a professional army that was well led by very fine combat

1192
01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:39.690
leaders,
most of whom were World War II or Korea experienced.

1193
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:43.110
I'm talking about senior NCO was and officers.

1194
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.980
They had a lot of battle experience that were high quality people and they were

1195
01:12:46.981 --> 01:12:50.100
badly used from the beginning.
They were traded out,

1196
01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:54.900
so we lost the noncommissioned officer corps almost straight away within the

1197
01:12:54.901 --> 01:12:58.620
first 18 months of the war.
After that,

1198
01:12:58.710 --> 01:13:03.450
there was no unit cohesion.
Every 365 days you had a new unit.

1199
01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.610
You had no institutional memory.

1200
01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.800
I know this might seem obvious,
but you got to keep people together.

1201
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.080
When you get a good team,
you got to keep them together.

1202
01:13:13.081 --> 01:13:14.610
You've got to keep them working together.

1203
01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.593
<v 1>Hmm,</v>

1204
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:22.400
<v 0>no one remembered what happened last month and they kept repeating the same</v>

1205
01:13:22.591 --> 01:13:24.660
mistakes again and again and again.

1206
01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:28.860
The Americans were in Vietnam for eight years and there were no leaders at the

1207
01:13:28.861 --> 01:13:32.640
top willing to raise hell and demand that the training be hard and demand the

1208
01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:37.620
standards Behi no one wanted to shake things up in a very,
very unpopular war.

1209
01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:39.540
Now,

1210
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.430
the finest thing you can do for any young soldier is be mean as hell with him

1211
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:49.410
and whack him in the head when he doesn't do something correctly.

1212
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.030
Make certain that he knows his job and knows how to do it right because if he

1213
01:13:54.031 --> 01:13:56.430
does it right,
he'll do it right on the battlefield.

1214
01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:01.200
But the whole training and leading leadership system,

1215
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:04.620
we're asking how can we resolve this disintegrating morale problem?

1216
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:10.110
We can resolve it by getting them are and are delivering cold beer and coke and

1217
01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:12.280
ice cream at night and hot food.

1218
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:15.850
This is what the generals mentality was.

1219
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.930
Instead of kicking them in the ass and making them do things right,

1220
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:23.830
screw on their steel pot,
carry their weapon and clean up their ammo.

1221
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:26.650
Get rid of their love beads and not smoke dope.

1222
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:31.420
When I took over my battalion of Delta,
it was grass all over the place.

1223
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.930
Before I'd go out with my battalion,
I'd shake everybody down.

1224
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.350
I boot people in the butt who even smoked cigarettes because you could smell

1225
01:14:38.351 --> 01:14:39.580
tobacco a mile away.

1226
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:43.840
You could see the light from a cigarette a couple of miles away.
In my unit.

1227
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:46.870
You didn't smoke anything and you certainly didn't smoke grass.

1228
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.660
It was just a question of discipline.

1229
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.800
If you had good leadership and provide a disciplined,

1230
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:58.000
designed not to harass,
but to keep people alive,

1231
01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:02.290
the soldiers would react.
So critical distinction.

1232
01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:04.680
They're not talking about discipline,

1233
01:15:04.681 --> 01:15:08.770
just just designed to harass people and do things for no good reason,

1234
01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.590
but discipline that's actually there to keep people alive.

1235
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:13.780
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1236
01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:18.460
<v 0>Continuing.
If they didn't have that,
they would react the other way.</v>

1237
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:23.580
What we saw between 1965 in 1973 when the last two s forces went out was a total

1238
01:15:23.981 --> 01:15:24.880
disintegration.

1239
01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:29.710
It was an organization that didn't have proper boundaries and didn't have people

1240
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:31.750
insisting on those boundaries.

1241
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:35.920
They were an army of hippies and they didn't have discipline.

1242
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:38.440
Had the war continued for a few more years.

1243
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:43.480
We were seeing at the end by 1973 units refusing to fight.

1244
01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:44.921
Well,

1245
01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:49.240
we'd have seen a whole army that refuse to fight because it was a most unpopular

1246
01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:52.600
war and soldiers were saying,
what am I doing here?

1247
01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.520
My politicians want me out.

1248
01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:57.700
My family wants me out and there's no purpose in being here.

1249
01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.700
This does not affect my country's security.

1250
01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:03.610
All I am is a pawn is stupid war.

1251
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:08.110
They were an army of hippies and didn't have discipline.

1252
01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:13.300
Had the war continued for a few more years.
We're seeing at the end,

1253
01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:16.840
19 by 1973 units refusing to fight.

1254
01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.440
Well,
we'd seen in hole we'd see.

1255
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:25.210
We'd have seen a whole army that refuse to fight because it was a most unpopular

1256
01:16:25.211 --> 01:16:28.270
war and the soldiers were saying,
what am I doing here?

1257
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.240
My politicians want me out,
my family wants me out,

1258
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:32.860
and there's no purpose in me being here.

1259
01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:35.140
This does not affect my country security.

1260
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.320
All I am is a pawn in a stupid war.

1261
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:46.470
I mean,
okay,
first of all,
obviously we're not talking about every,
every soldier,

1262
01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:51.120
every marine,
every service member in Vietnam that was acting that way.

1263
01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:55.560
Clearly there was people still doing heroic things and serving to the best of

1264
01:16:55.561 --> 01:16:56.394
their ability,

1265
01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:01.580
but he's making a broad general statement that if we saw in 1973 some units that

1266
01:17:03.991 --> 01:17:05.400
were saying,
hey,
we don't want to fight.

1267
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.880
Then if you would have continued down that trajectory eventually been saying,

1268
01:17:08.881 --> 01:17:12.230
Hey,
wait a second.
There'd be a lot more to units that would be saying that

1269
01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.430
next.
How did your soldiers,

1270
01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:22.940
particularly your fresh recruits cope with not knowing who the enemy was?

1271
01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:24.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1272
01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.430
<v 0>Hackworth.
When a soldier would arrive in Vietnam,
badly trained from the USA,</v>

1273
01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:30.900
not prepared for the war,

1274
01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:35.520
my procedure was that each unit form their own training program at division

1275
01:17:35.521 --> 01:17:40.110
level.
The young recruit would go through this training up to two weeks and his

1276
01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:43.800
particular in his particular area of operations.
For example,

1277
01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:46.050
looking after your feet in the Mekong Delta,

1278
01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.660
keeping your ammo dry and things of this nature.

1279
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:53.220
After they finish that division level training,
they would come to a unit.

1280
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:57.180
Normally I would talk to my soldiers,
welcomed them to the unit,

1281
01:17:57.181 --> 01:17:58.650
assigned them to a rifle company.

1282
01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.120
My standard operating procedure was to assign a young recruit to an old soldier

1283
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:06.540
in the same foxhole.
That soldier would be his buddy.

1284
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:11.610
A veteran would get a green recruit or fresh meat as they called them and he

1285
01:18:11.611 --> 01:18:15.150
would take that new guy and pass his knowledge to him.

1286
01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.120
Question,
where your soldiers ever reluctant to fight Hackworth?

1287
01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:26.300
I had the ability to motivate people even though a guy might be a pacifist in a

1288
01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:28.920
few days.
He was hunting for Charlie.

1289
01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:32.820
I never had a problem in terms of getting soldiers to fight.

1290
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.080
Question,
were you ever frightened?

1291
01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.540
Can you remember a moment when you were frightened?
Hackworth.

1292
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:47.790
I spent eight years on battlefields as a soldier and I'm sure that there what?

1293
01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:51.270
That there aren't very many minutes of those eight years that I wasn't

1294
01:18:51.271 --> 01:18:52.104
frightened.

1295
01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1296
01:18:53.370 --> 01:18:56.850
<v 0>It's something that lives in your stomach.
It's just churning all the time.</v>

1297
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.570
As the bullets starts snapping in the intensity of combat increases that

1298
01:19:00.571 --> 01:19:01.680
churning increases,

1299
01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:06.360
but it's always there as long as you're in a dangerous situation.

1300
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.960
You've got it and you're carrying it with you.
On your back

1301
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.843
question,

1302
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:17.240
did your soldiers have any compunction about shooting civilians on the chance

1303
01:19:17.241 --> 01:19:19.640
that they were Viet Cong Hackworth?

1304
01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:23.000
I think the average American soldier perceived the enemy as,

1305
01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:25.940
but for the grace of God there go I,

1306
01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:30.200
and they were reluctant to shoot somebody unless they knew they were the enemy.

1307
01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:31.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1308
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:34.150
<v 0>But if the guy we're coming at him at night,</v>

1309
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:38.530
if the guy we're walking in an area he shouldn't be in and had a weapons or

1310
01:19:38.531 --> 01:19:42.640
something like that,
the way I trained my soldiers was to react to automatically.

1311
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1312
01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:46.310
<v 0>Don't get the thinking process going.</v>

1313
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1314
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.390
<v 0>When you see a right cross come at,</v>

1315
01:19:49.391 --> 01:19:51.940
you block it with your left hand and go with a right hook.

1316
01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:54.730
I never had problems with soldiers being reluctant to fight.

1317
01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:57.563
Of course this is,

1318
01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:02.950
this is different then you know the SLA Marshall Report of people not wanting to

1319
01:20:02.951 --> 01:20:07.840
fight and it's also,
you know,
I'd be,

1320
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.210
I say this and sometimes people freak out about it when I say don't think right.

1321
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:15.420
It's I'm thinking,
Hey,
your alarm clock goes off in the morning.

1322
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:18.780
Don't think you just get up and you do what you're supposed to do.
Oh you,
you're,

1323
01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:22.350
you're,
you're supposed to work out.
Don't think about it.
Just go do it.

1324
01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:26.370
And that's what he's saying for a more important situation.
Oh,

1325
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:30.450
there's an enemy threat.
Don't think about it.
Do what you're supposed to do.
Yeah.

1326
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.440
Would it surprise you to know that the chief concierge at the Continental Hotel

1327
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:45.680
Saigon's top hotel was in fact working for the Vietcong Hackworth?

1328
01:20:45.681 --> 01:20:49.960
It wouldn't surprise me.
At Tet of [inaudible] 68 the secretary of the,

1329
01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.660
to the commanding general of the US forces in Vietnam,

1330
01:20:52.810 --> 01:20:57.810
General Westmoreland was found holding an AK 47 with the whole Vietnamese

1331
01:20:58.421 --> 01:21:01.480
apparatus.
I never once trusted a Vietnamese.

1332
01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:03.250
I never trusted a Vietnamese general.

1333
01:21:03.251 --> 01:21:06.460
I never allowed a Vietnamese inside my camp,
my Firebase.

1334
01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:08.950
If I were going to meet a Vietnamese colonel,

1335
01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.950
I would meet him outside my Firebase because I didn't trust him.

1336
01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:16.930
I assumed everybody was Vietcong.
Question.

1337
01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:20.530
And these are the people you were meant to be fighting for Hackworth.

1338
01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.570
That's right.
And that was my attitude.

1339
01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:27.220
The soldiers from the ninth division hated the South Vietnamese soldiers more

1340
01:21:27.221 --> 01:21:28.530
than they did the Viet Cong.

1341
01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.210
So what he's saying right there is,
I'm going to read that again.

1342
01:21:34.211 --> 01:21:37.930
My soldiers from the ninth division hated the South Vietnamese soldiers more

1343
01:21:37.931 --> 01:21:40.450
than they did the Vietcong.
That's horrible situation.

1344
01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.410
They saw them coming and going out.

1345
01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.990
They saw them going out on operations and not beating the enemy,

1346
01:21:46.991 --> 01:21:48.070
but avoiding the enemy.

1347
01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:51.490
They called it search and avoid where it was supposed to be.
Search and destroy.

1348
01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:55.120
My battalion could go all the way through the same area and come back bloodied

1349
01:21:55.121 --> 01:21:58.120
and battered.
That really got to my guys.

1350
01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:00.520
I was walking the perimeter one night.

1351
01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:04.990
I used the British system of Stan too in the evening where everybody was at

1352
01:22:04.991 --> 01:22:09.100
their post with a weapon ready to go.
Just as the sun was going down.

1353
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.860
One of my snipers said,
sir,
how's the body count today?
And I said,

1354
01:22:14.861 --> 01:22:18.550
not so good.
We only had eight or nine for the day for the battalion.

1355
01:22:19.630 --> 01:22:22.750
And he said,
well,
I'll get you two more before I could stop him.

1356
01:22:22.751 --> 01:22:24.130
He took out a sniper rifle.

1357
01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:28.300
I looked down at the end of the weapon to see you where it was pointed and it

1358
01:22:28.301 --> 01:22:31.570
was pointed at two South Vietnamese soldiers guarding a bridge.

1359
01:22:31.571 --> 01:22:33.550
About 40 meters from my perimeter.

1360
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.770
I knocked the weapon up before he had a chance to scream,
squeeze off around.

1361
01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.490
This was the attitude of a lot of soldiers.

1362
01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:46.150
They didn't like the South Vietnamese because they didn't pull their weight.

1363
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:52.940
Question,
why did massacres occur in Vietnam?
Hackworth?

1364
01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.113
Well,

1365
01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:00.120
the big massacre was me lie Lieutenant William Calley and Captain Medina where

1366
01:23:00.131 --> 01:23:03.970
the principal characters involved in that act.
Why did they have that occur?

1367
01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:07.780
It occurred a number of reasons.
The soldiers were frustrated.

1368
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:12.640
They were mainly frustrated because of mines and booby traps and because they

1369
01:23:12.641 --> 01:23:13.960
could never find the enemy,

1370
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.670
they were just tripping through minefields and seeing their mates blown away,

1371
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.760
never grabbing hold of the enemy and getting into a real fight.

1372
01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1373
01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.900
<v 0>Then there's a lot of people in a village and then in Saturday takes over and</v>

1374
01:23:27.901 --> 01:23:30.090
they just start blowing human beings away.

1375
01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:34.070
It's also about bad leadership.

1376
01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:36.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1377
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:38.680
<v 0>Lieutenant Calley had gone through officer candidate school.</v>

1378
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.870
He'd gone through three separate courses,

1379
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:45.040
was found wanting in leadership and two of them had had been recycled instead of

1380
01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:46.000
being booted out.

1381
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:47.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1382
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:50.620
<v 0>The military was into a numbers game and didn't want to have hot,</v>

1383
01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:53.320
have a tri high attrition rate for their officers.

1384
01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:56.470
They kept recycling someone until they graduated.

1385
01:23:57.370 --> 01:23:57.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1386
01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.280
<v 0>So here's a guy who never should have been trusted more than an army.</v>

1387
01:24:01.281 --> 01:24:02.960
Pfc Ends up a lieutenant.

1388
01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:04.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1389
01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:07.960
<v 0>He's with a platoon of soldiers who are extremely frustrated because of mines</v>

1390
01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:12.490
and booby traps and he doesn't have the leadership ability to control them to

1391
01:24:12.491 --> 01:24:14.200
say stop that fire.

1392
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:16.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:20.180
<v 0>I think massacres occur when you don't have strong leadership,</v>

1394
01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:23.750
when you don't have soldiers who are extremely well trained and well disciplined

1395
01:24:23.751 --> 01:24:27.170
and well controlled by their leaders.
That's what happened.

1396
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:28.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1397
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.790
<v 0>All those components fell apart</v>

1398
01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.060
and I think the book that we covered on the meal,

1399
01:24:37.061 --> 01:24:39.940
I'm masker actually gave even better details to me.

1400
01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:44.590
Obviously it gave better details cause it's a full book,
but I really was,

1401
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:49.060
one of the key things I remember is I remember how the intelligence escalated.

1402
01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:54.340
It escalated and I'll tell you something else he saying that,

1403
01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:55.320
<v 1>okay.</v>

1404
01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:59.010
<v 0>You know
that lieutenant Calley couldn't stop them.</v>

1405
01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.450
Lieutenant Calley led that masker.
He led the masker.
It wasn't him saying,
Oh,

1406
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:05.070
I can't get control of the guys know.

1407
01:25:05.071 --> 01:25:08.190
He was actually doing the massacre and they were fine.

1408
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:12.570
They were actually following him.
And that wraps up that,

1409
01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:16.020
that wraps up the interview.
It's kind of an abrupt ending.

1410
01:25:16.021 --> 01:25:17.130
I don't know why it's so abrupt.

1411
01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.770
I looked around to see if there was anything that was missing,
but that's,

1412
01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.020
that's how the,
that's how the interview ends.

1413
01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:23.730
But I wanted to go to it from there.

1414
01:25:23.731 --> 01:25:27.780
I want to just grab a couple sections out of the Vietnam Primer.
Again,

1415
01:25:27.781 --> 01:25:32.781
this is the book that that Hackworth wrote with Sla Marshall when they got back

1416
01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:38.580
for when it got back from this tour of Vietnam a few months long and they went

1417
01:25:38.581 --> 01:25:40.920
and talk,
debriefed all kinds of people.
And again,

1418
01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:44.460
there's all kinds of tactical level lessons in here.

1419
01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:48.150
I mean like real tactical doubling security,

1420
01:25:48.151 --> 01:25:52.320
contending with the jungle security on the trail,
the company and movement,

1421
01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:56.460
field intelligence.
I mean there's the defensive perimeter.
It's just various,

1422
01:25:56.461 --> 01:26:00.170
there is also a very short book.
It's not even a hundred pages long.
Um,

1423
01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.770
and like I said,
if you want to get this,
if you're in military,

1424
01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:07.970
you might be able to use this.
If you're leading up,
if you're a platoon leader,

1425
01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:10.790
you probably get some decent lessons learned out of this,

1426
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:15.820
but this isn't one of those books that translates directly to business because

1427
01:26:16.251 --> 01:26:20.990
it's actually not,
it's not about leadership.
It's about the tactics of

1428
01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.170
an infantry platoon of infantry company.
So,
but that being said,

1429
01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:30.570
of course there are some,

1430
01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.700
there are some lessons and what's interesting to me as also as I found these

1431
01:26:35.701 --> 01:26:37.200
leadership lessons,

1432
01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:40.620
they're not just leadership lessons beyond being leadership lessons.

1433
01:26:41.850 --> 01:26:45.480
There's a lot of lessons here for

1434
01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:49.480
you as a person for me as a person,

1435
01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:55.170
and you start taking the leadership lessons from Vietnam primer and applying

1436
01:26:56.351 --> 01:26:59.110
them to yourself.
I think you could see a lot of crossover

1437
01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:04.690
starting from a leadership perspective though.
Here we go.
Vietnam primer

1438
01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:10.440
back to the book are mistakes in Vietnam are neither new nor startling.

1439
01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.160
They are not something we can blame on the mysteries of warfare.

1440
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:17.460
They are the same problems that had been haunting small unit commanders since

1441
01:27:17.461 --> 01:27:21.330
before Gideon.
In peace or war.

1442
01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:25.590
These errors spell the difference between professionalism and mediocrity.

1443
01:27:27.090 --> 01:27:32.010
Many young leaders and chanted by the Hollywood image of war approach combat

1444
01:27:32.011 --> 01:27:34.470
with the good guy versus the bad guy attitude,

1445
01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:39.750
but there is no similarity between what John Wayne gets away with on the screen

1446
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.570
and the hot hard facts of a firefight.

1447
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:48.860
A small unit leader in combat cannot afford to have a film heroes,

1448
01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.470
devil may care attitude toward training,

1449
01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:56.450
discipline and basic soldiering in the recipe for battle.

1450
01:27:56.451 --> 01:27:57.284
Victory.

1451
01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:02.530
Well led and disciplined soldiers are the main ingredient soldiers who have been

1452
01:28:03.081 --> 01:28:07.460
conditioned through training to react by habit.
When constructed,

1453
01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:10.610
when confronted with the searing realities of engagement,

1454
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:13.370
the habits learned in training,

1455
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:18.020
good or bad are the same habits that move the soldier in combat.

1456
01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:23.480
A leader then must ensure that each of his soldiers as well trained and has

1457
01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.640
developed good habits,
habits,

1458
01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:30.440
so deeply ingrained through correct teaching and intensive practice that even

1459
01:28:30.441 --> 01:28:33.230
under the pressure of fear and sudden danger,

1460
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:36.590
each soldier automatically will do the right thing.

1461
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:39.103
<v 1>Check</v>

1462
01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.233
<v 0>continuing.</v>

1463
01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.360
There is no magic formula or sweat lists solution by which one can achieve this

1464
01:28:52.051 --> 01:28:56.320
goal.
There's no,
there's no hack.

1465
01:28:57.490 --> 01:29:02.490
Leaders may approach training for combat only with intense accepting as gospel

1466
01:29:03.211 --> 01:29:08.211
the timeless truth that better trained men live longer on the battlefield.

1467
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:15.060
No military unit is ever completely trained.

1468
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:19.170
There will always be a weak area that requires additional time and effort.

1469
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:24.900
The wise commander uses all available time to train his unit.

1470
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:27.180
He never says good enough

1471
01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:32.440
leaders must accept the old but absolute maximum.

1472
01:29:32.710 --> 01:29:36.970
The more sweat on the training field,
the less blood on the battlefield.

1473
01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:41.430
Combat is too serious of business to permit.

1474
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:44.700
Easy excuse of even one mistake.

1475
01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:52.820
Never quit checking,
check everything all the time.

1476
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.480
Weapons for cleanliness aid,
men for supplies,

1477
01:29:56.570 --> 01:30:01.130
centuries for alertness and the camp for field sin sanitation.

1478
01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.120
Another weakness among junior leaders is the inaccurate report of the estimate

1479
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:12.040
of the situation.

1480
01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:19.100
Estimates are many times either so greatly exaggerated or so watered down that

1481
01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:23.160
they are not meaningful to the next higher commander who must make critical

1482
01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:27.210
decisions as to troop employment,
an allocation of combat power.

1483
01:30:29.230 --> 01:30:34.230
The confusion and noise of the battlefield are two reasons why faulty estimates

1484
01:30:34.691 --> 01:30:39.691
are made over emotionalism and the sense of the drama are others.

1485
01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:45.490
These factors coupled with the judgment of an impulsive commander who feels that

1486
01:30:45.491 --> 01:30:48.490
he must say something on the radio,
even if it is wrong,

1487
01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:50.080
are the crux of the problem.

1488
01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:56.130
Commanders must report the facts as they see them on the battlefield.

1489
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:58.380
If they don't know the situation,

1490
01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.470
they must just say that.

1491
01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:05.750
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1492
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:06.531
<v 0>and again,</v>

1493
01:31:06.531 --> 01:31:11.531
those are just a couple little lessons learned out of Vietnam primer and

1494
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.050
you know,
I think one of the things,
like I said,

1495
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:24.050
there's a lot of things that you can take from what Hackworth talks about and we

1496
01:31:24.051 --> 01:31:28.800
talks about leadership
and you can actually apply it to yourself.

1497
01:31:28.801 --> 01:31:31.440
You can apply it to your personal life.
And some of the things that he just said,

1498
01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.680
thinking about some of these are mistakes are nothing new or startling.

1499
01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:36.923
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1500
01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:42.590
<v 0>think about that.
Most of the time.</v>

1501
01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:47.420
Most of the time,
think about this.
Most of the time when you make a mistake,

1502
01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.120
it's something that you already knew.

1503
01:31:50.121 --> 01:31:52.910
You actually know you're making the mistake when you're making it.

1504
01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:53.853
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1505
01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.380
<v 0>Here's another thing he says,
errors.</v>

1506
01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:01.900
Spell the difference between professionalism,
a mediocrity.

1507
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.740
It's the little things.
It's the little mistakes that you make.

1508
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:12.540
Next thing he thinks says disciplined soldiers are the main ingredient in

1509
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:16.210
victory.
Well,
guess what?

1510
01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:20.850
The main ingredient in victory in your life is discipline.
Yeah.

1511
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.823
All Day.

1512
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.000
He says there's no magic formula or sweat lists solution by which one can

1513
01:32:30.401 --> 01:32:35.340
achieve their goals.
I think he just said,
there is no,

1514
01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:40.110
there is no shortcut.
There is no hack.
There's no sweat list solution.
You,

1515
01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:41.910
you're gonna have to work.

1516
01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.810
Then he says this,
no military unit is ever completely trained.
Guess what?

1517
01:32:48.811 --> 01:32:51.300
Neither are you.
Neither am I.

1518
01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:57.030
There is always weakness to work on.
Always a lot of them.

1519
01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.273
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1520
01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:05.440
<v 0>He says this in Vietnam,
primer combat is two series of business to permit.</v>

1521
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.230
Easy excuse of even one mistake.

1522
01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:15.830
Now think about this.
Okay.
Comments two series of business.
Why is that?

1523
01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.120
It's because you can die,
but guess what?
We're all going to die.

1524
01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:24.320
We're all going to die.
So why would we,

1525
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:29.060
why would we allow ourselves to make easy,
easy excuses?

1526
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:33.590
Why would you allow that calm?
That's life and death,

1527
01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.240
so his life,

1528
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:43.200
so you shouldn't allow yourself these easy excuses.
And then the last section

1529
01:33:44.730 --> 01:33:49.230
that he dead,
he talks about that I read,
it can absolutely be applied.

1530
01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:54.300
It can absolutely,
absolutely be applied.
He says another weakness,

1531
01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:59.480
common among junior leaders is the inaccurate reporting of the estimate of the

1532
01:34:00.121 --> 01:34:00.954
situation.

1533
01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:06.260
They are either so exaggerated or wolf so watered down that they are not

1534
01:34:06.751 --> 01:34:11.310
meaningful.
Now again,

1535
01:34:11.311 --> 01:34:14.250
if you apply this to yourself,
what you realize

1536
01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:21.090
is that you got these junior leaders that they're lying to the chain of command.

1537
01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.640
I mean they're,
they're exaggerating or they're watering things down,

1538
01:34:23.641 --> 01:34:25.320
but they're basically lying to their chain of command.

1539
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:28.650
And how does that translate to us?
We lie to ourselves.

1540
01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:29.693
<v 1>Mm.</v>

1541
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.470
<v 0>That's how it translate to us.
We lie to ourselves.</v>

1542
01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:37.700
We don't tell ourselves the way things really are.
And when we do that,

1543
01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:41.300
then we can't fix our problems.
If we can't fix our problems,

1544
01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:45.800
we're not going to improve.
So we have to be truthful to ourselves.

1545
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:50.790
I have to be truthful to myself.
You have to be truthful to yourself.

1546
01:34:50.970 --> 01:34:54.360
You have to stop rationalizing,
stop making excuses.

1547
01:34:54.450 --> 01:34:59.450
Stop telling yourself little water down of where you're really at.

1548
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:01.310
Tell yourself the truth

1549
01:35:05.650 --> 01:35:10.350
so that you can get where you want to go.
You can be who you want to beat.

1550
01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.370
You could be,
oh,
you should be

1551
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:19.380
who'd you should be.
When you do what you know you should do.

1552
01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:24.060
When you pay attention to the little things,
when you implement discipline,

1553
01:35:24.930 --> 01:35:29.190
true and unflinching and on mitigated discipline in your life.

1554
01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:33.510
When you stop,
when you stop trying to find a sweat list solution,

1555
01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:37.510
when you look for weaknesses to work on,

1556
01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:42.720
when you allow no easy excuses and all that starts,

1557
01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.100
when you stop lying to yourself,

1558
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.340
can you stop lying to yourself?

1559
01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:54.000
That's when you can become who you know you should be.

1560
01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:57.510
When you tell yourself the truth about where you are,

1561
01:35:57.570 --> 01:36:00.570
so you can make sure you are in the right place.

1562
01:36:00.571 --> 01:36:02.370
And if you're not in the right place,

1563
01:36:02.371 --> 01:36:04.890
that you can get yourself on the path to get there.

1564
01:36:08.730 --> 01:36:13.680
The path of discipline,
the path of hard work and the path of

1565
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:16.343
truth.

1566
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:21.430
<v 1>And I think</v>

1567
01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:28.300
<v 0>that's all I've got for tonight.
So</v>

1568
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:34.910
Echo Charles,
speaking of the path,
the path,
the path of truth,

1569
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:42.510
we're open to any suggestions you may or may not have on how we can get on that

1570
01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:47.480
path and then go ahead and stay on that path.
Stay on the path.
Yeah.

1571
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:52.550
I feel like
more and more of us are on the path.

1572
01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:55.220
That's what I feel like you don't at the roll call,

1573
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:59.270
roll call roll call that we just got done,
which was an event.

1574
01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:03.590
If you don't know for military first responders,
law enforcement,

1575
01:37:04.130 --> 01:37:05.630
paramedics,
firefighters,

1576
01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:09.690
there was a lot of people there that are straight up on the path readout

1577
01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.090
legitimately on the path.

1578
01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:15.090
<v 2>Yup.
Yeah.
And it's one of those deals where,
you know how,</v>

1579
01:37:15.091 --> 01:37:18.820
like when you hear a certain story and then you know,
uh,

1580
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:21.570
about someone and you're like,
oh,
like,
Dang,
that's impressive.

1581
01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:24.960
And then you hear it again and again and again,
and then you're like,
okay,

1582
01:37:24.961 --> 01:37:26.160
you know,
I'm kind of used to it.

1583
01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:30.180
I don't feel like I've gotten used to this at all because everyone's story's

1584
01:37:30.181 --> 01:37:31.380
kind of different,
you know?

1585
01:37:31.381 --> 01:37:36.381
So it kind of exposes this element of like re like just immense individuality of

1586
01:37:38.581 --> 01:37:42.390
a person,
you know?
So it's,
it's Kinda like,
um,
I dunno.
It's like,
I don't know,

1587
01:37:42.391 --> 01:37:45.330
maybe like your kid's birthday or something that happens over and over again,

1588
01:37:45.331 --> 01:37:49.650
but never gets old,
you know,
kind of that kind of situation.
Um,
there was a guy,

1589
01:37:49.651 --> 01:37:50.484
he was like,

1590
01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:55.080
and he just told me this while we were listening to you guys do Jujitsu and you

1591
01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:58.800
just right in the middle of it,
just kind of in my ear kind.
He's like,
dude,

1592
01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:02.700
I lost 70 pounds just because I'm on the path.

1593
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:07.380
Geez,
guys were just guys and girls,
females,

1594
01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.330
boys and girls.

1595
01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:15.000
Men and women were walking up to me and like,
show me pictures.
Yeah.
Hey,

1596
01:38:15.001 --> 01:38:17.680
this is what I looked like 13 months ago.
Yeah.

1597
01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:23.820
I've lost 38 pounds or whatever.
Yeah.
Awesome.
I got promoted.

1598
01:38:24.090 --> 01:38:28.650
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's awesome.
So yes,
you are correct.

1599
01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:33.390
There's a lot of people on the path.
Kids,
everything.
Kids ever.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

1600
01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:38.040
People.
I made little videos for kids.
I was looking at videos,
kids,

1601
01:38:38.041 --> 01:38:40.290
kids doing pull ups,
kids doing Jujitsu,

1602
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:45.000
little warrior kids straight up on the path,
knowing the,

1603
01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:49.680
knowing the Gettysburg address.
Hey,
look at this kid.

1604
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:52.500
Look at my son.
He knows the Gettysburg address.
He's six.

1605
01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:58.010
Look at my daughter.
That's six pull ups right there.
Yep.

1606
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:02.640
You know how many she could do last year?
Zero.
You see what I'm saying?

1607
01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:06.140
Yes sir.
Do you think it's going to get crowded on the bat?

1608
01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:12.440
No.
It'll get wider.
Maybe the path gets wider.
It gets wise.

1609
01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:17.050
Everyone's kind of on their own path,
but there's just a unified,
yeah.
Oh,
there's,

1610
01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:21.540
there's common ground on the path.
On a fundamental level,

1611
01:39:21.541 --> 01:39:24.990
actually there's,
there's immense commonality down there,

1612
01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:29.130
but the path is big enough to maintain the not going to get,

1613
01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.670
there's not gonna be a traffic jam on the path.
Nope.
And in fact,

1614
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:35.090
it's the opposite.
It's the opposite.
The more people have a path,

1615
01:39:35.091 --> 01:39:39.010
the faster it goes.
More momentum.
Yeah.
Shoot.

1616
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:44.250
So weird how you can take leadership principles and apply them to yourself.
Yeah.

1617
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:48.060
Yeah.
So it's almost like a lie to yourself.
Think about that.

1618
01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.650
Because you think about the little lies you tell yourself.
Oh yeah,
they utilize.

1619
01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:57.780
So long time ago,
my mom was like overweight.
I didn't know.
I mean,

1620
01:39:57.781 --> 01:40:00.320
I guess I knew that,
I don't know when you're a little kid,
you don't know.

1621
01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:06.930
And My,
and then so she got on the path back in the day and,

1622
01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.930
and she lost a bunch of weight and my dad said,
hey,
you know what?

1623
01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:14.730
I'm going to get your mom for her birthday.
I was like,
what?
He's like a mirror,

1624
01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:18.330
a full size mirror because she lost a bunch of ways.
You're very good,
you know,

1625
01:40:18.331 --> 01:40:23.070
whatever now.
And I was like,
cool.
You know,
that's something,
I don't stuff,

1626
01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.870
whatever furniture was a furniture,
good,
good,
good job,
dad,
whatever,
you know,

1627
01:40:27.871 --> 01:40:28.530
kind of.

1628
01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:31.260
And then like I kind of thought about it and I'm thinking about it more now.

1629
01:40:31.261 --> 01:40:35.610
It's like,
man,
you know what that,
you know what that says that says that like,

1630
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:39.780
you know,
she was like overweight and she was from my dad to know that,
you know,

1631
01:40:39.781 --> 01:40:43.830
and to take action.
Like that means that he knew that she was in a way,

1632
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:48.640
in one way or another,
avoiding the mirror.
And I would say yes,

1633
01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.680
straight up avoiding it,

1634
01:40:49.681 --> 01:40:53.530
but she just didn't want to see herself in the mirror mean you said same thing I

1635
01:40:53.531 --> 01:40:53.980
said,
I guess

1636
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.510
<v 3>I said a little bit of different way,</v>

1637
01:40:55.511 --> 01:40:59.530
but she didn't want to see yourself in the mirror.
Right?
Like if you have a,

1638
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:00.670
and you kind of think about it,

1639
01:41:00.671 --> 01:41:03.580
sure you have a mirror in the bathroom and it's sort of it,
but like,

1640
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:05.530
I don't know where,
where else do we have mirrors,
right?

1641
01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.290
Like I dunno in the bedroom or something.
You don't want girls get ready.

1642
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:10.390
I don't know.
I'm comparing it to my current situation.

1643
01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:15.190
I have no idea of the mirror in the bathroom medicine cabinet.
That's it.
Yeah.

1644
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.640
Yeah.
I guess I guess my,
you know what,
you're right,
because both my daughters,

1645
01:41:18.670 --> 01:41:21.820
my older daughters had mirrors in their room like yeah,
all love.

1646
01:41:21.821 --> 01:41:26.290
So they can get ready,
right?
Or they get the outfit,

1647
01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:31.690
I dunno.
Mirror,
but for a girl,
I don't know.
Again,

1648
01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:34.900
I'm just totally like thinking of my situation.
So,
and yeah,

1649
01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.970
so like kind of thinking back,
I'm like,
Dang,

1650
01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:38.290
we only had the mirror in the bathroom anyway.

1651
01:41:38.291 --> 01:41:42.670
So for that to be the case for a mirror to be a good gift where your dad's going

1652
01:41:42.671 --> 01:41:45.790
to tell you like,
hey,
how's this as a gift?

1653
01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:49.570
It kind of indicates that you don't like cool.
It's like,
oh yeah.
So anyway,

1654
01:41:49.630 --> 01:41:50.411
the point is like,
yeah,

1655
01:41:50.411 --> 01:41:53.800
we do kind of like to ourselves even if we don't think we're necessarily lying

1656
01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:57.980
herself.
She didn't want to admit certain things.
See a mission,

1657
01:41:58.810 --> 01:42:00.010
mission lying by omission.

1658
01:42:00.011 --> 01:42:02.590
Like I'm not even going to look at myself and therefore I don't full address.

1659
01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:06.460
Yeah.
Yeah.
Their and not even a problem,
spending more of my life or whatever.

1660
01:42:06.461 --> 01:42:10.840
It's like,
yeah.
It's like lied by omission.
Like if you don't do Jujitsu.

1661
01:42:11.250 --> 01:42:15.310
Yeah.
Like No.
If you don't do Jujitsu all one day,

1662
01:42:15.311 --> 01:42:18.820
if you don't do Jujitsu one day,
let's say there's,
let's say there's an a month,

1663
01:42:18.821 --> 01:42:20.920
there's four days that you didn't do Jujitsu,

1664
01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.940
three of those could have been legitimate days where you legitimately,

1665
01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.020
for whatever reason,

1666
01:42:26.021 --> 01:42:30.250
couldn't do to one of those days might've been predicated on a lie that you told

1667
01:42:30.251 --> 01:42:34.130
yourself.
Right?
Yeah.
I just don't have time today.
Yeah.

1668
01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:38.830
When what you really did was you extended some work,
an extra cause that's a,

1669
01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:42.880
there's a weird time.
There's a word time thing that happens with Jujitsu.
Like,

1670
01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.800
Hey,
class starts at star class starts at four 30 or class starts at four like,

1671
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:48.670
Hey,

1672
01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:53.440
I'm going to roll at five 30 the guys are everyone's training at six right?

1673
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:55.180
Hey,
we're doing no get six.

1674
01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:00.600
Well if I get caught up in something mysteriously and all of a sudden it's six

1675
01:43:01.631 --> 01:43:04.030
Oh four at my house.
Uh,
you know what,

1676
01:43:04.031 --> 01:43:09.031
I won't even get there until six 20 or six 15 by the time I get changed,

1677
01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:14.380
you know the guys will probably be done.
You just told yourself a bunch of lies.

1678
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:18.460
Well there I would say because there is no,
that's not nothing.

1679
01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:21.780
The this at my house gets called the Jujitsu window.
Oh okay.

1680
01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.680
Cause there is no gym.

1681
01:43:24.210 --> 01:43:27.400
The Leica then I should have said this then the light came earlier.

1682
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:31.230
The light came on,
which was like I should really get this done right now.
Yeah,

1683
01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:33.730
no you could get that done when you get home later.
But you just,

1684
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:36.820
you just extended that window cause you wanted to shut that you did to wind on

1685
01:43:36.821 --> 01:43:38.950
yourself.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
That's what happens.

1686
01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:42.130
And that window is like that's a weird psychological area to be in.

1687
01:43:42.131 --> 01:43:45.160
Cause it's cocaine.
I call it at home,
I call it the Jujitsu window.

1688
01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:47.850
That's why it's kind of like,
what am I looking for?
Will be like,
Hey,
can you,

1689
01:43:47.890 --> 01:43:52.070
can you just go later?
I was like,
no,
you can't.
There's a,
and it's super,

1690
01:43:52.071 --> 01:43:52.761
super narrow.

1691
01:43:52.761 --> 01:43:56.540
Just like I said when it's six Oh four and you're supposed to be there at six is

1692
01:43:56.541 --> 01:43:58.160
that,
cause here's the factors one,

1693
01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:01.460
everyone will be either finishing up or late in the rounds,

1694
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:06.350
you'll get one roll.
So kind of the later you show up,

1695
01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.330
the less training you're going to get,

1696
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:12.620
less training you get the less worth it it is to get dressed and get all your

1697
01:44:12.621 --> 01:44:15.910
stuff together and go.
I'm not saying it's going to be not worth it.
Yeah.

1698
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:18.740
But it becomes less and less worth it.
Right.
So there's that.

1699
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:21.110
And then there's like the social things like,
Oh,

1700
01:44:21.111 --> 01:44:23.660
you're the guy that shows up on the last round where everyone's tired.

1701
01:44:23.661 --> 01:44:26.150
What are you doing dude?
You know,
there's kind of like a stigma with that.

1702
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:30.470
When somebody says that to me,
I'm like,
I live.
I just got done working.

1703
01:44:30.471 --> 01:44:33.380
I came here as quickly as I could and I'll tell you what,

1704
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:38.300
I'll do 35 burpees right now.
You bed,
we can train you.

1705
01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:42.110
Yeah.
And that's of course that's not cause because that's not always the case.

1706
01:44:42.111 --> 01:44:44.300
I mean with you,
I can't even really ever actually done that before.

1707
01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:50.240
And just your answer there kind of indicated like that's never happened to you.

1708
01:44:50.241 --> 01:44:53.690
Has it like kind of thing.
There's,
there's one big,

1709
01:44:53.710 --> 01:44:58.370
Eric can be like,
oh you're showing up.
I'm like Bro,
he always has any,

1710
01:44:58.371 --> 01:44:59.930
any also did like one round.

1711
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:06.440
Go on to here.
Come on,
you don't care.

1712
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:11.300
Another thing I'll say is if he's done anything else that day,

1713
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:15.560
he'll tell you about it.
Like,
Hey,
I went and ran stairs this morning.

1714
01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:18.830
I'm like that's cool.
I squatted did sprints,

1715
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:21.320
went surfing and now I'm here to train what

1716
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:29.750
yet.
But nonetheless,
did you use the window?
It's real.
You know,
cause you'll,

1717
01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:33.470
you'll let me just miss the opportunity.
I don't mean this in a hostile way.

1718
01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:37.400
How come?
Sometimes when the Jujitsu class starts,
let's say it,

1719
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:39.440
let's say we're going to train at had 11 how come?

1720
01:45:39.441 --> 01:45:42.320
Sometimes you show up at like 1148

1721
01:45:45.450 --> 01:45:48.820
but it seems like your window is way just off alignment.

1722
01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.230
I don't know.
Let's call it a Sunday,
right?

1723
01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:55.840
We all know what time we start training.
Right.

1724
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:59.160
And then sometimes you come rolling in.
I mean,
you weren't talking about you.

1725
01:45:59.161 --> 01:46:02.790
You're like,
Hey,
well,
you know,
you're 15 minutes late,
these guys can be done.
I'm,

1726
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:07.930
I'm an hour and a half rounds and you're rolling in like bowing up to me.

1727
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:11.930
Well,
I'm going to bullet regardless.
Then of course I'm not going to be saying,

1728
01:46:11.931 --> 01:46:14.510
hey,
you know,
you're showing up late and I'm kinda tired.
No,
I'm going to say,

1729
01:46:14.511 --> 01:46:18.250
okay,
well you showing up.
We'll do what we gotta do you know what it is?
Okay.

1730
01:46:18.330 --> 01:46:19.850
Because I have no idea.

1731
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:24.500
I have no idea how someone could be knowing that all of his training partners

1732
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:29.300
that want to train with him are there at 10 o'clock or at 11 o'clock and that

1733
01:46:29.301 --> 01:46:34.100
individual decides,
Hey,
I'll just show up at 1148 and call it good.

1734
01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:39.440
This is what happened on Sunday.
The normal routine has always been,

1735
01:46:39.441 --> 01:46:43.140
I come at noon for Greg trains.
No g train.
Okay,
okay.

1736
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:47.420
And anytime you for two,
three,
four years,
you've shown up at that time.

1737
01:46:47.421 --> 01:46:50.280
See me in a ball of sweat.
Yeah.
12

1738
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.600
<v 2>rounds deep.
Yeah.
No,
if you,
if you remember correctly there,</v>

1739
01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:57.930
there are times that I'll come,
it'll be me,

1740
01:46:57.931 --> 01:46:59.760
you and Andy just going round Robin.

1741
01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:03.210
There will be those times but and you're looking at the amount of times that

1742
01:47:03.211 --> 01:47:07.080
Andy and I have done that.
It's a very large number.
I know.
But here,

1743
01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:11.940
this is why though.
So it has to do with like my whole over a life scheduling.

1744
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:12.960
See what I'm saying?

1745
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.770
So noon is the best time and I get to crate trained with Greg and you know,

1746
01:47:16.771 --> 01:47:20.800
all this stuff and then you'll text me like the day before or seen her going to

1747
01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:25.080
freaking tent.
Oh.
And I'm like
hardcore,

1748
01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:29.340
crazy schedule.
I need to call your assistant to get to put in your calendar

1749
01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:35.040
the day before.
Anyway,
I'll text Andy and like,
I'd be like,
Hey,

1750
01:47:35.041 --> 01:47:39.720
I'm heading to the gym in 15 minutes.
He's like,
I'm on my way Thursday night,

1751
01:47:39.721 --> 01:47:42.540
Thursday,
Sunday morning,
whatever.
Bro.
What if,
okay.

1752
01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:47.520
What if you and Andy had Trump plans to train at 10 and I text you,
hey,

1753
01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:50.370
let's train at one 30 I'd say no,

1754
01:47:50.371 --> 01:47:55.371
be here at 10 30 cause because we're not training then we're training at at 10 I

1755
01:47:55.771 --> 01:47:57.450
still don't understand why one 30 hey,

1756
01:47:57.451 --> 01:47:59.880
you can train cause that's what time we trained.
Well,
what about one three?

1757
01:47:59.881 --> 01:48:03.660
What's the difference?
We've got other things to do.
There you go.

1758
01:48:03.661 --> 01:48:04.890
We have other things to do.

1759
01:48:05.130 --> 01:48:08.250
So I had like obligations as far as scheduling goes normal.

1760
01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:13.080
This is not like a random thing that happens.
This is the steady state for years.

1761
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:18.360
Yeah.
1148
they're probably counting yourself.

1762
01:48:18.361 --> 01:48:22.530
Let's be too early for that.
I do,
I do.
I do.
1148 is when you come in,

1763
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:26.460
we'd come in and you see sweat.
Yeah.
Are you a little bit bummed out?
Yes.

1764
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:30.180
Not Adjust your schedule.
Why wouldn't you calendar yourself?
Well,

1765
01:48:30.181 --> 01:48:33.200
because it's weird.
It's like I'm on this,
it's on,

1766
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.400
I'm on this like psychological pat.
Like lying to yourself.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I'm still,

1767
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:41.710
I'm not lying to yourself.
Hackworth says no,
I'm going to lie.

1768
01:48:42.130 --> 01:48:45.010
I'm going to go ahead and assume that I am lying to myself until,

1769
01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:49.350
so I'm going to find it and admit it to myself.

1770
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:52.470
But this is what it feels.
Lighter comes the light here because

1771
01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:58.410
it could be like,
this could be fun,
like all week I do whatever,
whatever,

1772
01:48:58.411 --> 01:49:02.580
whatever.
Right?
And I trained at a certain time on Sunday.

1773
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:07.230
My normal like habitual kind of routine on Sunday is a noon training.

1774
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:11.310
So everything before noon that I do and have to do or whatever,

1775
01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:13.920
that's just sort of in place.
It doesn't take much mental work.

1776
01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:17.940
But then if you're like texted me the night before saying,
Hey Tan,
I'm like,

1777
01:49:17.941 --> 01:49:18.774
oh man.

1778
01:49:19.290 --> 01:49:22.590
Kinda in my mind I'm already kind of committed to the noon to myself though,

1779
01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.640
truly seems say,

1780
01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.540
Oh,
this isn't just a lie.

1781
01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:36.750
Then he was like a whole conspiracy.
Run against yourself.

1782
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.510
Oh,
that's ridiculous.

1783
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.600
It's not ridiculous because I do have other things to do with Eddie Bravo

1784
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:55.990
or consider this like,
okay,
so let's say I have x,
Y,Z ,
one,
two,
three,

1785
01:49:55.991 --> 01:50:00.410
four things I got to do before noon.
And then when I get back,
I dunno,

1786
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.940
that's the thing.
But they log their time.

1787
01:50:02.970 --> 01:50:06.460
They are time sensitive in the sense that I do have to do them.

1788
01:50:06.461 --> 01:50:08.170
So if I plan to do them before training,

1789
01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:11.320
now I've got to shift all that other stuff.
We're like,
you know,

1790
01:50:11.410 --> 01:50:13.870
and there's other people involved,
all this stuff anyway,

1791
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.740
so it's usually the case,
but looking for,

1792
01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:21.130
no one's going to follow you down the path.
You're right.
That's the thing.

1793
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:24.280
And now that I don't know what's real funny,
and you know,
this is the truth.

1794
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:27.600
This is,
this is,
this is good actually at the end of the day.
Good.

1795
01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:31.960
So all have a lot of see this situation that I'm telling you and you're like

1796
01:50:31.961 --> 01:50:36.010
laughing at me and telling me how I'm lying to myself that this situation goes

1797
01:50:36.011 --> 01:50:39.550
on in a lot of ways with me.
But yeah,

1798
01:50:39.551 --> 01:50:42.370
but you're going to confess,
I'm confessing this.

1799
01:50:42.371 --> 01:50:47.371
So when I tell you like out loud stuff and some of the stuff is like I just

1800
01:50:48.821 --> 01:50:50.950
start telling you and just the look on your face.

1801
01:50:50.951 --> 01:50:52.960
I'm like probably know the answer rating.
I know already.

1802
01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.870
And this is one of those things where before I got into it,

1803
01:50:55.900 --> 01:50:58.210
I was like for real committed to it.
Like this is like true.

1804
01:50:58.211 --> 01:50:59.680
That's how it is and this is the reason.

1805
01:50:59.681 --> 01:51:01.870
And sometimes they'll come train with you guys,
you know,

1806
01:51:01.871 --> 01:51:04.690
when I do all this work to shift it around.

1807
01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:08.020
But if I were to just shift it around and be like,
that's the new schedule,

1808
01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:09.820
like I could do it.
It's a miracle.

1809
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:13.743
All right bro.

1810
01:51:14.690 --> 01:51:19.040
<v 3>You know what,
I just,
I just realized it's very good.
Uh,
uh,
very uh,</v>

1811
01:51:19.041 --> 01:51:21.440
very solid quality.
I'd have talked about,

1812
01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:24.680
I always talk about people like everyone's allergic to criticism.

1813
01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.400
Like everyone hates getting criticized,

1814
01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:29.630
like you told me to do something different than what the 40 talking about.
Yeah.

1815
01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:34.070
You're actually very open to criticism and I think part of it is because,

1816
01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:37.520
well,
maybe it's because when I criticize you,
I'm not telling you like,
Hey,

1817
01:51:37.521 --> 01:51:39.410
do what I do.
I'm just saying like,
Hey,

1818
01:51:39.411 --> 01:51:41.870
you tell me what your reason is and we'll figure it out.
If you're like,

1819
01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:46.550
I realize you yourself are not over on my side of the table over here.

1820
01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:50.640
We think we suspect were suspect of the,

1821
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:55.460
of the statement.
Very suspect.
So there it is.

1822
01:51:56.070 --> 01:52:00.980
Anyways,
what the,
the thing is maybe we can adjust that.
Maybe we can,

1823
01:52:01.050 --> 01:52:03.480
we can snuff out that lie.
We can find out what the truth isn't.

1824
01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:05.300
The truth is you should be training with your training,

1825
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:09.680
your normal training partners.
Yeah.
On the Sunday whenever that,

1826
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:15.310
whenever that that that agreed upon time is out there.

1827
01:52:16.590 --> 01:52:19.490
Ted Cox,
Nice.
11 o'clock at night,
10 o'clock at night.

1828
01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.090
You know it's nice to get hold gym.

1829
01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:26.910
<v 2>You mean the whole gym?
I just empty.
Oh yeah.
You just curate,</v>

1830
01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:30.960
ain't just gifts getting after it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is.
Remember,

1831
01:52:31.130 --> 01:52:34.120
remember when we first opened this gym and you were like,
hey,

1832
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:37.390
we got new before the mats were all even in and you were like this new mats

1833
01:52:37.391 --> 01:52:40.030
downstairs.
Remember that?
And then there was still,

1834
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:44.410
I wanted to test them out with the new maps.
Yeah and we're rolling.

1835
01:52:44.630 --> 01:52:45.760
We're rolling Abbott like

1836
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.940
<v 3>pretty long as far as two guys rolling now.
And then you were like,</v>

1837
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:52.670
isn't it just so awesome when you have your own gym?

1838
01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:57.530
But it's true.
I was like Dang man.
Must Be.

1839
01:52:57.810 --> 01:53:01.670
Cause it's like you just had the whole bill,
you know it is very nice.

1840
01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:05.770
Just Sir that as a nice thing to have.
Speaking of the Jujitsu,
okay,

1841
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:07.880
look everyone we're going to do too.
That's what we're doing.

1842
01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:10.160
If you're on the path that we're looking or interested,

1843
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:13.550
if the path is right for you kind of situation.

1844
01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:16.430
If someone's Geek curious and it is,
yeah,
yes.

1845
01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:19.220
And you're doing you just so you're going to need a g because he can't just,

1846
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:23.110
just do know Geek.
As tempting as that might be good.
It is tempting.

1847
01:53:23.550 --> 01:53:26.300
Do some Geek.
It's tempting until you say,
well,

1848
01:53:26.301 --> 01:53:31.301
do you want to be so good in one thing and this be lost with something that's so

1849
01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:35.780
close and they both compliment each other.
Yes.
They really do.
Yeah.

1850
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:41.350
I did a bunch of rounds of Geeky in at peak PMMA.

1851
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:47.180
Yeah,
it was good.
Good.
Some good rounds.
Good.
Did you do two players out there?

1852
01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:52.070
That's some good times,
but it was Augie as Augie.
I was like,

1853
01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:54.350
I told JP,
I'm like,
Hey,
I'm not bringing a gay.

1854
01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:57.470
And he's like,
hey,

1855
01:53:57.471 --> 01:54:01.640
just bring your belt and I'll get you give you need it just for the class then

1856
01:54:01.641 --> 01:54:04.340
you can roll Geena.
No,
he afterwards.
So I'm like,
okay,
cool.

1857
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:10.330
And then I put the key on how to Geek is one of his geese pants were too tight.

1858
01:54:10.471 --> 01:54:14.690
I couldn't move my legs was,
it's super ugly.

1859
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:19.550
No,
it was uh,
it was an origin key cause one of the warrior ds,

1860
01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:22.760
the lightweight ones.
Anyways,
long story short,

1861
01:54:22.761 --> 01:54:26.180
got a bunch of good Ramsen Nikki.
So yeah,
you're going to need to get,

1862
01:54:26.181 --> 01:54:29.060
if you're on the path and you started Jujitsu or you've already started,

1863
01:54:29.061 --> 01:54:31.130
you just so you're going to need a gate,
what can you do?
You need,

1864
01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:33.410
that's the question.
That's always a question.

1865
01:54:33.411 --> 01:54:38.150
You get an origin Giesen lot of question.
Not Anymore.
No.
There it is.
Boom.

1866
01:54:38.151 --> 01:54:41.510
Question answered.
Origin Geek,
go to origin main.com.

1867
01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.580
That's where you get your geek on made in America.

1868
01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:47.870
All made in America from beginning to end.

1869
01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:50.330
There's some rash guards do for Nogi,
so boom.

1870
01:54:50.331 --> 01:54:55.331
Get them both and get your Jujitsu established.

1871
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:59.660
Did you say rash guards?
Yes.
Okay.
You got rash guards and other,

1872
01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:03.950
what do you call this?
Normal clothes.
Normal clothes.
That's what I say.

1873
01:55:03.951 --> 01:55:08.780
Apparel one day you like.
That's,
that's,
that's not,
not,
not the thing to say.
No,

1874
01:55:08.781 --> 01:55:12.380
no,
no.
I said I,
I said apparel to clear it with you.
You said cool.

1875
01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.340
No fashion though.
Yeah.
Even though he,
he's,

1876
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:20.960
he has one pinky in the fashion
and he's got more than a pig.

1877
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.520
He's got a whole art thing going on.
Respect and law.
Joe,

1878
01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:29.460
what were you doing?
Oh yeah,
we're taking the picture at the immersion camp.
Yeah.

1879
01:55:29.630 --> 01:55:32.030
And he started like Pete started getting all,

1880
01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:34.100
hey you come over here a little bit.
Hey we need to,

1881
01:55:34.290 --> 01:55:38.180
and was really taken some artistic control.
The situation I said to Joe,

1882
01:55:38.181 --> 01:55:40.430
I said here comes the big artists Guy Comin out

1883
01:55:42.610 --> 01:55:45.990
laughing everyone.
Yeah.
So he's got more than just a pinky in there.

1884
01:55:46.650 --> 01:55:47.820
Both pinkies at a minimum.

1885
01:55:47.821 --> 01:55:50.220
Well good cause not everybody is like you and some people they liked that

1886
01:55:50.221 --> 01:55:54.720
fashion element to what they were.
I was going to talk to Pete about this.

1887
01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:56.760
So Pete and he's listening right now.
Sure.

1888
01:55:57.610 --> 01:56:01.050
I was actually a very accurate statement when I said when we had this

1889
01:56:01.051 --> 01:56:01.980
conversation before.

1890
01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:07.340
My ultimate goal of fashion is to make no impression.

1891
01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:14.940
Yeah.
And I guess that's completely the wrong thing to do.
Yes sir.
It is.

1892
01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:18.030
But that's my thing.
If you,

1893
01:56:18.090 --> 01:56:22.560
I want my clothing to look in such a way that when you look at me,

1894
01:56:22.561 --> 01:56:27.380
you just see,
you know,
what you see what normal.
Okay.

1895
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:30.540
This still feel normal.
Like just normal clothes.

1896
01:56:30.541 --> 01:56:31.380
Like you wouldn't be able to say,

1897
01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:35.580
I bet that guy now the exception that I have to as I got the victory MMA tee

1898
01:56:35.610 --> 01:56:37.110
shirt.
That's your thing.
Yeah.

1899
01:56:37.710 --> 01:56:41.190
And the reason I have that is because I have a bunch of them and I just wear the

1900
01:56:41.191 --> 01:56:43.950
same thing every day.
So I have that little thing.

1901
01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:47.580
But if you see me traveling where I'm not wearing tee shirt,
I'm going to,

1902
01:56:47.581 --> 01:56:48.840
we were on something or you,
you just think,

1903
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:51.610
oh this is just a normal person or not.

1904
01:56:51.630 --> 01:56:55.920
This person has no nothing.
Right,
right.
Oh thing.

1905
01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:59.820
Yeah.
Well,
so if you,

1906
01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:02.190
I don't want to call this a mistake,

1907
01:57:02.191 --> 01:57:07.191
but here's the thing that makes it almost like an antiquated kind of scenario.

1908
01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:12.450
Okay.
Cause you're like I'm,
my goal is you said my goal is to be normal,

1909
01:57:12.451 --> 01:57:17.070
whatever.
If that's your goal is not to make a statement.
Right.
You know,
your,

1910
01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:21.510
that's your fashion.
They're fats,
your statement.

1911
01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.600
So by just by way of your whole discourse,

1912
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:28.390
you're doing what you're trying not to do.
It's kind of like,
um,
well I guess I,

1913
01:57:28.391 --> 01:57:31.350
I guess what,
I guess I should have phrased it differently.

1914
01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:36.680
What I normally would wear is just stuff that looks normal and leaves,

1915
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:41.030
although I guess,
yeah,
no,
I guess there is,

1916
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:45.360
I guess in this day and age you have to make some kind of an effort.

1917
01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:50.250
So I guess in a horrible way I'm making some kind of a fashion effort.

1918
01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.770
Yeah.
No,
you don't what you need or who you are though.

1919
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:55.530
This is what it feels like.
Anyway.
I did it however you want to explain this.

1920
01:57:55.530 --> 01:57:58.470
What if you'll remember Bruce Lee when he was like on the boat,

1921
01:57:58.770 --> 01:58:01.660
he was going to know which one it was and another dragon.
I don't know.

1922
01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:06.210
He's on the boat.
Right?
Going over to,
and the guy's like,

1923
01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:11.190
what's your style?
And he's like,
my style,
he's fighting without fighting.

1924
01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:15.210
That's your style right there.
It's fashion without fashion.

1925
01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:19.280
Browse looking at old pictures of us.
Yeah,
like all like I dunno,

1926
01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:22.890
like Oh nine 10 dang,
that's almost 10 years ago.

1927
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:27.690
And work is like me aid.
I think ti was there and then you know,

1928
01:58:27.691 --> 01:58:30.800
it's like whatever you being you same you by the way,
same exactly.

1929
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:35.080
Drug called normal faith and guess what you're wearing victory tee shirt.

1930
01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:39.770
That's your whole uniform or got a lot of them and it's,
you know,

1931
01:58:39.970 --> 01:58:41.800
very straight forward I it anyways.

1932
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:45.460
Fashion without fashion and that's the joc and luckily Pete's got your back and

1933
01:58:45.461 --> 01:58:50.350
you know it's cool.
This is cool because Pete also has a sense of that.

1934
01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:54.080
Who else is making a black on black sweatshirt,
right?
There's no,

1935
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:58.030
you can't see the origin of you can see it but you got to,
you know you're not,

1936
01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:02.290
you're not drawing attention to yourself.
Yeah,
I guess that's the thing,
right?

1937
01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:04.060
I'm trying not to draw attention to yourself.

1938
01:59:04.730 --> 01:59:07.570
Just be a little bit more laid back with that stuff.
Yeah,

1939
01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.130
because you guys used to make fun of me at seal team two cause I,
I had,

1940
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:14.530
that was when I was competing all the time.
Did you?
Jitsu tournaments.

1941
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:15.520
So I had like,

1942
01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.760
they used to just like the main thing you'd get from a juicy German,

1943
01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:21.200
a little cheesy metal and a tee shirt,
tee shirt.
So I had all these Jews.
Every,

1944
01:59:21.370 --> 01:59:23.770
I had a different t shirt.
I had a different you did through t shirt.

1945
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:26.950
So there guess what I was doing was just wearing what I was given.

1946
01:59:26.951 --> 01:59:29.010
But that's what it kind of stood out.
Yes.

1947
01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:33.090
Even though these are all just free tee shirts.
Well,

1948
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:36.100
although I paid for the Higgs and Gracie one,
I had to take some Gracie teacher.

1949
01:59:36.110 --> 01:59:41.020
I've paid some money for that one.
That's cool.
$12.
The old Pecos Street Academy,

1950
01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:45.580
some old school people remember that right now we're best in the west.

1951
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:49.030
Best of the West.
It was the [inaudible] attorney.
Yeah,
I remember that.

1952
01:59:49.031 --> 01:59:53.260
But that was little later.
I'm talking old school grappling games.

1953
01:59:53.261 --> 01:59:56.020
I'm talking Joe Merera in school.

1954
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.570
The Gracie,
what was that?
Gracie invitational.
Greasy nationals.
Gracie,

1955
02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:04.500
I think it says canal.
It's called the grace net.

1956
02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:07.690
Neutral grounds is going old school.

1957
02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:14.980
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.
I could go down memory lane with you.
Um,
you know,

1958
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:17.450
it's not do it,
but anyway,
yeah.
[inaudible] get,

1959
02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:21.220
get ordered and get all origin stuff for Jujitsu.
That's the,

1960
02:00:21.250 --> 02:00:25.990
that's the spot to go.
Even like the joggers and the sweats,
sweat stuff.

1961
02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:31.720
Most comfortable in the world.
Boom.
Also supplement.
You can get some supplements,

1962
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:32.650
joint warfare,

1963
02:00:32.650 --> 02:00:36.970
getting some Rave Leif Babin he said he went off joint warfare,

1964
02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:40.660
I think you said four or five days.
Whatever's on the trip.

1965
02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:44.350
And she said his knee started hurting again.

1966
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:48.770
Came back and went back on the joint warfare.
Guess what?
Knee healed up.
He,

1967
02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:53.660
I mean he,
I dunno.
Healed but it's no longer sore.
Yeah,
yeah man.

1968
02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.960
That's all.
You know what's,
you know what's so funny?
It's like me,

1969
02:00:55.961 --> 02:00:59.620
I'm all like surprised when it was my experience.
Just like,
you know,

1970
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:03.350
obviously late surprises me enough to tell you about it,
you know,

1971
02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:05.700
and just like me where it's like,
Dang Bro.
I told them,

1972
02:01:05.770 --> 02:01:09.310
I told them we put illegal stuff in joint warfare.
Like I told him,
I was like,

1973
02:01:09.311 --> 02:01:11.860
hey man,
don't tell anyone,
but we put some little,
we put some little,

1974
02:01:11.861 --> 02:01:16.340
a steroidal and,
and he was all looking at me.
He didn't,

1975
02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:19.540
he probably me for 0.3 seconds because he didn't really believe me that much.

1976
02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:24.220
But then I was like,
no,
I'm just kidding man.
But
anyway,
a sketch.
But nonetheless,

1977
02:01:24.221 --> 02:01:26.900
isn't that supposed?
Isn't that odd though?
That we're all surprised.

1978
02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:30.130
Surprise breads?
It's supposed to do that,
you know,

1979
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.150
like it's supposed to do these things.
Yeah.

1980
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:33.820
But I think at the level that it does,

1981
02:01:33.821 --> 02:01:37.060
it too is a little more the what people expect.

1982
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:40.760
There you go.
Get on the Krill oil too.
Yup.

1983
02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:45.480
Now discipline.
Um,

1984
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:50.530
we've got some debates going on on whether Dave,
no,

1985
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:51.970
Dave Burke,
good.
Guilty.

1986
02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:56.120
Whether he should be the actual representative.

1987
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:58.900
Clearly he's the representative discipline.
Yes.

1988
02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:04.640
But for milk and the full mock train,
he's looking a little lean.

1989
02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.740
Yeah.
He's lean.
So he is the lien representative mark.
He's the before picture.

1990
02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:15.800
That's cold blooded.
You know,
maybe if there's people that are like,
wait,

1991
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:19.480
I don't want to get all big.
Hey Dave Burke,

1992
02:02:19.481 --> 02:02:24.430
he's on the milk trained fully on the milk train.
Yeah.
And he's not huge.
Yeah.

1993
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:29.090
Well,
well let's break it down.
So to me personally,

1994
02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:33.770
I don't think Dave Burke should be the poster child for milk.
Shouldn't be,
wait,

1995
02:02:33.771 --> 02:02:35.120
is he treading on your territory?

1996
02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:42.300
I didn't know this is a sensitive issue anyway.
I should have,

1997
02:02:42.410 --> 02:02:45.170
I should have read it into this more.
Sorry.
But still the idea,
you know,

1998
02:02:45.171 --> 02:02:48.470
you're the representative of the mole.
Check could be technically he could be.

1999
02:02:48.471 --> 02:02:53.390
So what protein,
rice protein.
Additional protein.
Because look,
you work out,

2000
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:57.620
you lift,
you work out,
you do,
you know all this extra hard exercise.

2001
02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:59.960
Bloom protein is part of their recovery process.

2002
02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:03.140
A big part of the recovery of call them building blocks for lack of a better

2003
02:03:03.141 --> 02:03:07.490
term,
whatever.
And boom,
the malt comes in.
Boom.
Right?

2004
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:12.200
But the malt tastes good.
Right?
So here and here's this side.
No,

2005
02:03:12.230 --> 02:03:14.120
this is why it's important for it to taste good.

2006
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:17.920
This may or may not go against your whole,
actually it will.
No,
I won't.

2007
02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:22.190
It seems like what?
But it tastes good.
So let's say I'm like,

2008
02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:25.100
I'm on the fence about working out.
I know you can't relate to that part,

2009
02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:29.390
but let's say you are,
then you're like wait,

2010
02:03:29.391 --> 02:03:33.840
but when I work out I can take the milk.
So it like fits in,
you know it one,

2011
02:03:33.850 --> 02:03:35.780
there's one with the other that's the best known.

2012
02:03:35.781 --> 02:03:39.330
Those guys that just thought just the supplements alone would get them Jay.

2013
02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.273
Exactly right.

2014
02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:43.760
And that's part of the point cause you don't exist just so everyone knows you

2015
02:03:43.761 --> 02:03:46.310
don't have to work out to have milk.
You can have milk without working,

2016
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:48.800
but it will taste better if you worked out well.

2017
02:03:48.801 --> 02:03:53.600
If you take milk or any PR like additional protein for the reason you take

2018
02:03:53.601 --> 02:03:57.740
protein,
I'm saying and you don't work out,
there's no reason to take it.
True.

2019
02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:02.690
Seem saying like any excess calories and settled for the fact that milk tastes

2020
02:04:02.691 --> 02:04:03.320
good.

2021
02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:07.160
You could actually just take more because there's no reason to eat ice cream and

2022
02:04:07.161 --> 02:04:09.560
chocolate chip ice cream except for it tastes really good.
Yeah.
But that's,

2023
02:04:09.561 --> 02:04:13.340
that's a slippery slope though.
That's not the path.
So officially,
by the way,

2024
02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:16.050
we established this,
this was,
I think I was talking to the leaf.

2025
02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:19.700
The opposite of the path is a slippery slope.
Okay?

2026
02:04:19.701 --> 02:04:23.660
You can step off the path for 10 minutes for one day,
for one week.

2027
02:04:23.661 --> 02:04:25.010
But keep in mind,
the more you're,

2028
02:04:25.011 --> 02:04:27.320
the more time you spend off the path fee you're going to slip.

2029
02:04:27.321 --> 02:04:29.970
It's a slippery slope.
So boom,
nonetheless,

2030
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:33.530
if your whole mindset is to drink milk,
just because it tastes good,

2031
02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:37.550
no exercise,
no this Bruh you,
you're,
you're,

2032
02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:40.140
that's the wrong path and you're going in the wrong direction.

2033
02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:44.220
We'll speed of foot on the slippery slope at that point.

2034
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:49.050
And you kind of facing the wrong way.
Yeah,
that tastes good.
Boom.

2035
02:04:49.051 --> 02:04:52.740
Same reason.
But you're not,
you're saying your pizza,
you're two feet are off.

2036
02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:57.450
That's true.
Molson one foot's on the path.
Mulkin working out.
You're on the path.

2037
02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:00.810
Kind of like real quick because we're getting crazy here.
Uh,

2038
02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:03.630
we got mint chocolate chip,
we've got peanut butter chocolate,

2039
02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:07.040
Dave Burks favorite mint chocolate is my favorite.
What's your favorite mint?

2040
02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:09.960
Yeah,
but you make some cause you're psycho.

2041
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:15.310
And now new two new flavors are out vanilla gorilla and we got a chocolate,

2042
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:20.190
which is called the darkness.

2043
02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:26.070
When I eat vanilla gorilla,
I was like,
Hey,
no,

2044
02:05:26.071 --> 02:05:28.250
we need to make it vanilla gorilla.
And then he wrote,

2045
02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:31.920
he like paused and we were texting and he's like,
wait,
seriously?

2046
02:05:32.010 --> 02:05:35.610
And I was like yes.
Then he made the little crazy looking vanilla grill,

2047
02:05:35.611 --> 02:05:38.190
a little white gorilla.
So anyways,

2048
02:05:38.250 --> 02:05:42.390
vanilla gorilla is the name and the chocolate of course is called darkness.

2049
02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:45.450
And if you don't know there are layers to both those comments.

2050
02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:49.410
If you know about the darkness and know that one.
And if you know,

2051
02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:53.000
if you know life well then you can figure out the vanilla gorilla.

2052
02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:56.693
Yes,

2053
02:05:56.820 --> 02:06:01.820
these are all impeccable things can impeccable.

2054
02:06:02.101 --> 02:06:05.370
That might not be the correct word,
but they are impeccable things to Stan.

2055
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:08.610
Keep you on the path and indeed 100% indeed.

2056
02:06:08.970 --> 02:06:12.090
Also Jack was doors called Jocko store.

2057
02:06:13.530 --> 02:06:18.300
This is where you can get shirts and hoodies and hats,
more rash guards,

2058
02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:21.690
different feel different,
not physical field but different,
different.

2059
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:26.100
There was Kinda,
this is pretty cool at the roll call when we did Jujitsu,

2060
02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:31.050
there was people in the,
I've never done Jujitsu before area.

2061
02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:33.390
They had rash guards.

2062
02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:37.650
Yeah they had Jocko store rash guards that def core rash cards

2063
02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:43.950
and they had origin rash guards.
Yeah.
A lot of stuff.
A lot.
That's a lot of that.

2064
02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.180
When you just look at that one room,

2065
02:06:45.181 --> 02:06:49.170
it was filled with a lot of stuff that's made in America,
which is a big deal.

2066
02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.930
It was.
And that says a lot for someone who's never done you just to get,

2067
02:06:51.931 --> 02:06:54.090
they have the rash guard.
So that's kind of like in a way,

2068
02:06:54.091 --> 02:06:56.620
I don't want to say commitment necessarily cause it's a little bit,

2069
02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:02.880
I bet you there was people there that said I'm going to try the Jujitsu and I'm

2070
02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:06.420
going to continue down the path as people know you got to get on the Jujitsu

2071
02:07:06.421 --> 02:07:09.780
path.
Yeah.
That's just part of the deal.
Yeah.

2072
02:07:10.170 --> 02:07:13.250
I think I questioned me.
Yeah.

2073
02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:18.090
At the roll call after we got done teaching.
He's like,
so his Jujitsu,
the best,

2074
02:07:18.210 --> 02:07:19.530
you know,
thing to start with

2075
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:23.580
as opposed to anything.

2076
02:07:25.650 --> 02:07:30.270
I was like,
yeah man,
we did you hear everything?
I just said,
come on man.

2077
02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:34.110
Yeah,
do it.
Yeah.
I said,
what about,
and he said,
what about,

2078
02:07:34.111 --> 02:07:37.830
what about like striking though?
And I said,
well,
you know,
start with boxing,
get,

2079
02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:40.030
get,
get,
get to Moitai when you get good at boxing,

2080
02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:43.150
you can start open it up a little bit.
He's like,
oh,
should I start with that?

2081
02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:46.270
And I was like,
no,
cause if I grab you,
that's not gonna work anymore.

2082
02:07:46.690 --> 02:07:50.980
And if some bad guy grabs you,
that's not going to work anymore.
So anyways,

2083
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:54.070
and I said,
yeah,
cool.
I always try to put myself in,

2084
02:07:54.130 --> 02:07:56.530
in like outside of my own brain,
because you know,

2085
02:07:56.531 --> 02:08:00.560
when like if someone asks me detach,
if they're like,
hey,

2086
02:08:00.561 --> 02:08:04.360
is you did to the best martial,
I'm like,
not even the other options.

2087
02:08:04.361 --> 02:08:07.780
Don't even enter,
you know,
it's just like,
yes,
yes,
yes.
Like constant,
yes thing.

2088
02:08:07.781 --> 02:08:11.970
But I'm like,
wait,
you know,
let me,
let me consider this.
You know,
um,

2089
02:08:12.330 --> 02:08:16.330
like try to let go some of my bias.
Anyway,
Dr Jocko store,

2090
02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:19.720
we've got some good stuff on there.
If you want to represent the path,

2091
02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.840
discipline equals freedom.
Straight up.
Cause it does.

2092
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:27.460
It's the uniform for the path.
It is.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's a good way of putting it.
Oh,

2093
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:31.480
I would say there's a new discipline equals freedom.
Sure.
Yeah.
Sure.

2094
02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.370
Is it different?
No.
Said standing out.
No.
These things are all kind of,
you know,

2095
02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:40.350
that's just how these,
these aren't fashion items.
Well,
but they do make us,

2096
02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:45.310
they do.
There's this dichotomy to everything,
my friend.

2097
02:08:45.311 --> 02:08:47.890
Yes sir.
There is.
If you want to represent,

2098
02:08:47.891 --> 02:08:50.050
you want to represent it in the wild by there were,

2099
02:08:50.230 --> 02:08:54.160
there were guys with the shirt that you design with my head on it,
but I haven't,

2100
02:08:54.190 --> 02:08:57.760
I don't think I've ever felt more honored in my life.
That was pretty good.

2101
02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:00.810
It was pretty solid.
Multiple people wearing the Dang shirt.

2102
02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:06.100
You decide can I designed or I guess you'd called Nag shirt.

2103
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:10.480
Yeah.
Well,
you know now you're going to keep the layers anyway.

2104
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:13.120
If you want to represent Jocko,
store.com also,

2105
02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:18.040
if you want to support the message,
the word,
what do you guys call it?

2106
02:09:18.041 --> 02:09:20.170
Spreading the word as we're passing the word,
spread the word,

2107
02:09:20.171 --> 02:09:22.390
pass the words the word.
Yet you want to pass the word,

2108
02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:26.620
subscribe to the podcast on iTunes and stitcher and wherever you live.

2109
02:09:26.650 --> 02:09:28.630
I mean it seems obvious,
but if you haven't subscribed,

2110
02:09:28.631 --> 02:09:33.170
subscribe and don't about that.
Don't forget about that warrior kid podcast.
Yes,

2111
02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:38.290
which
is your,
you're going to learn lessons from it for sure.

2112
02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:40.900
Your kids are going to dig it and it's going to get your kids.

2113
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.530
Are we going to talk about the pathway?

2114
02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:45.640
It's going to get your kids on the path as well,
which is awesome.

2115
02:09:45.670 --> 02:09:46.260
I'll Scott though.

2116
02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:51.260
They wore your kids soap from Iris Oaks ranch.com that's Aiden.

2117
02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:55.240
He's a warrior kid and he's got his own business.

2118
02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.400
He's making soap and that's awesome.

2119
02:09:57.910 --> 02:10:02.830
From goat milk of goats that he raised himself and then he,
he,
the whole process,

2120
02:10:02.831 --> 02:10:05.080
he sent me all these pictures of it.
What he actually does.

2121
02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:10.420
He's got a manufacturing thing going on in America.
In America.
Yes.
By the way,

2122
02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:14.230
goats,
the goats are American goats.
There you go.

2123
02:10:15.890 --> 02:10:17.710
Yeah.
And also youtube,

2124
02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:23.020
we've got a youtube channel and that is where that is where Ekos legit videos

2125
02:10:23.021 --> 02:10:23.854
are.

2126
02:10:24.190 --> 02:10:29.190
And he's putting them up on a pretty regular basis and he's got a plan in place

2127
02:10:31.090 --> 02:10:35.540
to increase that even more.
Sure.
And as long as that fits his schedule.

2128
02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:40.790
And then we got psychological warfare,

2129
02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:45.320
that's an album with tracks of me talking and telling you why you should do

2130
02:10:45.321 --> 02:10:47.030
something instead of not do something well,

2131
02:10:47.031 --> 02:10:48.740
why should not do something instead of do something,

2132
02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:54.140
how to stay on the bad reasons.
Slippery slope calls.
There you go.
So get on that.

2133
02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.460
Yeah,
that's available through all the places you get.
Mp3S.
Yeah.

2134
02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:01.700
What about a psychological warfare to,
it's common.
We're working it.

2135
02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:04.010
We're working on it.
Yes sir.

2136
02:11:04.130 --> 02:11:07.850
Also on it.com/jocko,
by the way,

2137
02:11:07.851 --> 02:11:11.630
this is where you can get your other fitness gear.

2138
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:16.510
So remember back in the day we had the uh,
there actually back when,

2139
02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:21.320
when you were explaining the essentials of own home gym.
Yes.
Right.
Number one.

2140
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:23.570
So look when you're growing.
Yeah.
Number one is rings,

2141
02:11:23.571 --> 02:11:27.050
which I got from on it by the way.
Which Eczema kids enjoy those two.

2142
02:11:27.050 --> 02:11:29.810
The other phone for Nice,
nice quality quality.

2143
02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:33.980
None the less when you're expanding your home gym in the event of you having a

2144
02:11:33.981 --> 02:11:36.200
home gym or even if you don't have a home gym,

2145
02:11:36.201 --> 02:11:40.670
this is where you can get the stuff to sort of begin that really good stuff on

2146
02:11:40.671 --> 02:11:42.860
there.
A kettle bells is my,

2147
02:11:42.861 --> 02:11:45.800
I would say that's my number one number one thing to have.

2148
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:47.860
That would be my recommendation.
You say offerings,

2149
02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:52.370
you say rain's do pull ups on kettle bells bro.
Well I know,
well wait,

2150
02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:54.050
do you like pull ups?
I like pull up.

2151
02:11:54.051 --> 02:11:57.740
Why can't really do them now in your game when you're,
when you're,

2152
02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:01.730
when you're 100% yeah,
I mean yes,
but not like you like pull ups.
Like it's,

2153
02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:05.600
you know how you have your,
the ones you like.
Like when I started kettlebells,

2154
02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:08.580
I really liked him.
I thought was Super Fun because there's a lot.
He had an,

2155
02:12:08.590 --> 02:12:09.423
anyway,
they're fine.

2156
02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:12.740
I get them from on it and there's a lot of cool other cool stuff on there.

2157
02:12:12.741 --> 02:12:17.570
So Yacko on it.com/jocko also Jocko white tea.

2158
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:19.100
You can get the tea bags,

2159
02:12:19.130 --> 02:12:22.730
you'd get the can and when you get the tea bags or do you get the can either
one.

2160
02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:24.500
It doesn't matter because what you get with that,

2161
02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:27.080
you get an 8,000 pound dead lift.
100% guaranteed.

2162
02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:29.960
Although I did have one guy complain at roll call.

2163
02:12:30.650 --> 02:12:35.490
His dead lifts only 7,400 so probably.
Yeah,

2164
02:12:35.491 --> 02:12:40.130
he's probably not.
I told him to get after it harder and then it got some books.

2165
02:12:40.131 --> 02:12:45.131
Also the t is available on Amazon and the store and Jocko store and Rocco store.

2166
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:50.480
There you go.
I figure ultimately you we will unify.

2167
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:53.540
Yeah,
well I guess the kind of the goal,

2168
02:12:53.541 --> 02:12:55.790
the short term goals kind of make it just available.

2169
02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:59.090
Like if you're going to grab the shirt,
rash,
guard,
whatever,
and you're like,
Hey,

2170
02:12:59.091 --> 02:13:00.440
let me grab [inaudible].
Good point.

2171
02:13:01.170 --> 02:13:04.060
I saw an Amazon store when we were in Dallas or not,

2172
02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:08.090
not an Amazon store and Amazon like obvious shipping facility.

2173
02:13:08.690 --> 02:13:09.523
This thing was

2174
02:13:11.690 --> 02:13:16.690
huge and it was surrounded by trucks that were backed up to it.

2175
02:13:16.761 --> 02:13:21.380
You know,
loading docks just,
it was crazy.
It was totally nuts.

2176
02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:23.640
And I was like in there somewhere there's something,

2177
02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:27.080
there's a little bit of Jocko white tea getting ready to roll out and increase

2178
02:13:27.081 --> 02:13:31.500
somebody's dead lift.
I made me happy.
They'll say in there.

2179
02:13:31.650 --> 02:13:35.670
They also had books in there.
Yup.
Jocko books.
Jocko books.
Yes.

2180
02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:40.230
They had way the warrior kid.
You think they had that one nice?
They did.
Yeah,

2181
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:43.650
they absolutely do.
They had the field manual.

2182
02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:46.050
So w the way the word kid and Mark's mission,

2183
02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:51.500
I signed so many of those books at roll call of the personal messages to the

2184
02:13:53.071 --> 02:13:55.920
kids and everything.
The kids are getting on the path.

2185
02:13:55.950 --> 02:13:59.400
This is factual.
Awesome.

2186
02:13:59.910 --> 02:14:04.910
So get the books for your kids and get them a pull up bar and get them a Jujitsu

2187
02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:08.700
class.
Cause that's what they're going to want to do.

2188
02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:13.020
And those two things are going to help them through their entire life through

2189
02:14:13.021 --> 02:14:15.480
their entire life.
Yeah.
And that's actually a good heads up.

2190
02:14:15.481 --> 02:14:16.860
Cause like if you're like,
hey,

2191
02:14:17.130 --> 02:14:20.880
you already got the pullup bar and like the Jujitsu classes,
scout it out,

2192
02:14:20.881 --> 02:14:22.200
you know,
and then so you're just ready.

2193
02:14:22.201 --> 02:14:25.850
You're ready for the request because your kids are going to be,
they're going to,

2194
02:14:25.890 --> 02:14:30.030
they're going to want to get on the path.
Yeah.
And I think it was you,

2195
02:14:30.031 --> 02:14:33.840
I was telling this to where I was reading the part where he has to fix up his

2196
02:14:33.841 --> 02:14:38.040
bike.
The other one had spoiler spoil anything.
But anyway,

2197
02:14:38.041 --> 02:14:42.420
he needed money.
You need money.
So he's like,
Hey,
did you get money?
You got to,

2198
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:45.570
you got to get a job.
And you know,
it lays out the whole thing.

2199
02:14:45.571 --> 02:14:47.340
All the layers of the thing.
That was pretty good.

2200
02:14:47.670 --> 02:14:52.110
So right after I was done with that chapter,
my five year old daughter,

2201
02:14:52.230 --> 02:14:56.790
by the way,
she looked,
kind of sits back,
almost disappointed looking.
She goes,

2202
02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:00.840
she goes,
I wish I had a job that was,
oh Dang.

2203
02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:03.840
I don't think I ever felt like man when I was telling a work ethic into a kid

2204
02:15:03.841 --> 02:15:06.950
that's five years old about wanting to work and wanting to work,

2205
02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:11.850
wanting to have a job and wanting to,
that's just like legit.
Yeah.
Yes.

2206
02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:14.190
Get those books where the work had marks mission

2207
02:15:15.810 --> 02:15:18.490
or you can also get the discipline equals freedom field manual.

2208
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:22.110
I sounded a ton of those.
Again,
there's,

2209
02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:26.730
there's some people that that book hit them hard,

2210
02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:30.470
hard and they made some significant changes in their lives.

2211
02:15:30.471 --> 02:15:32.580
So everyone that came up to me and told me that,

2212
02:15:32.581 --> 02:15:37.581
thank you and I appreciate that feedback and it's awesome to see that book

2213
02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:43.350
hitting people the way that it hit me when I wrote it.

2214
02:15:44.190 --> 02:15:46.380
And it's awesome to see.
In fact,

2215
02:15:46.381 --> 02:15:50.730
that beginning part is what you're reading today.

2216
02:15:50.731 --> 02:15:54.960
There is no hack.
Yup.
There's no sweat lists.
Uh,

2217
02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:57.660
pursuit,
sweat lists,
pursuit,

2218
02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:01.050
sweat list direction definitely.

2219
02:16:01.051 --> 02:16:02.910
And then of course there's extreme ownership,

2220
02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:05.760
which was written by me and my brother Laid Babin

2221
02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:12.330
combat leadership for use in your business and life.

2222
02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:17.940
Then we also have this week just released,
so this,

2223
02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:22.830
this is live now at this time,
order it immediately.

2224
02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:24.240
The dichotomy of leadership.

2225
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:27.780
A couple reviews already up there cause some people got some advanced copies,

2226
02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.000
awesome reviews.
Everyone is

2227
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:33.970
<v 0>stoked,
including including me and life.
You know,
we,
we wrote it and you know,</v>

2228
02:16:33.971 --> 02:16:37.210
we'd edit each other and it'd be like burrowed nice chapter and be like,
Bro,

2229
02:16:37.211 --> 02:16:42.170
nice chopped her.
I'm like,
Hey,
you know,
so yeah,
we,

2230
02:16:42.171 --> 02:16:46.000
we,
we critique each other and edit each other.

2231
02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:50.620
So the book is,
it just takes it to another granular level.

2232
02:16:50.621 --> 02:16:53.920
That's what it does.
It takes it down to another granular level,

2233
02:16:55.090 --> 02:16:58.720
I think.
And some people are saying that they're more,

2234
02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:01.680
people are going to get more out of the dichotomy of leadership than they don't

2235
02:17:01.690 --> 02:17:04.960
have extreme ownership.
They definitely compliment each other.

2236
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:08.440
But there's a lot to be learned.

2237
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:12.400
A lot of the mistakes that people make are going to be corrected through the

2238
02:17:12.401 --> 02:17:15.250
dichotomy of leadership.
Yeah,
yeah.
Cause you know,

2239
02:17:15.251 --> 02:17:19.900
when people would make a change in their,
whatever you know,
may make,
it's like,

2240
02:17:19.901 --> 02:17:23.290
what do you see?
Actually you're the first time I heard this over,
correct?

2241
02:17:23.430 --> 02:17:24.300
Correct.
Yes.
Yes.

2242
02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:28.570
People will overcorrect people over correct all the time and they throw off the

2243
02:17:28.571 --> 02:17:30.040
balance of the dichotomy of leadership.

2244
02:17:30.730 --> 02:17:33.880
And so when you read the dichotomy of leadership,
you'll become aware of that.

2245
02:17:33.881 --> 02:17:36.250
You'll see what the signs are and you'll be able to correct him.

2246
02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:40.240
And this is gonna.
This is gonna really help out leaders in the world.

2247
02:17:40.241 --> 02:17:43.990
So dichotomy,
leadership available.
Now,
I haven't been think of that.

2248
02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:48.940
This book has been in the work for a long time and now it's out.
It's released.

2249

2251

it's the military personnel around the world that keep our country free.

2288
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:37.040
It's all the first responders out there,

2297
02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:18.040

be.

2300
02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:28.541
to be disciplined and you're going to have to look at yourself and tell yourself

2301
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.990
the truth,

2302
02:21:32.310 --> 02:21:33.143
<v 1>and then</v>

2303
02:21:34.470 --> 02:21:38.160
