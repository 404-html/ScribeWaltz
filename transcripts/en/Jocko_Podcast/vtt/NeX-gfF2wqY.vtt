00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.300
How do you stay motivated and how do you motivate people when they start to

2
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:05.134
slack?

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.570
Now motivation is,

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.560
it's kind of a strange word because it doesn't really mean what we think it

5
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:23.040
means.
We think it means that we're fired up to do something.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.720
We think that it means we're eager and passionate to make something happen

7
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.660
and we think that somehow we should just be able to turn on that eagerness and

8
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.400
turn on that passion.

9
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.070
But we can't

10
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.140
because you just can't turn on passion.

11
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.210
You can't just turn on the desire to execute.

12
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:01.800
A task
just doesn't work that way.

13
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.690
And honestly that isn't even what motivate means.

14
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.120
Motivate doesn't mean to yell and scream and encourage.

15
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.500
No,
to motivate actually means to provide a motive.

16
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.190
A reason why.

17
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.680
So to motivate someone is to explain to them why they're doing what they're

18
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:37.280
doing,
how it will help them,
where it'll take them,

19
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.870
why they should continue to work and a struggle and a fight.

20
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.280
And when you need motivation yourself,

21
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.850
well look for someone to scream and yell.

22
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.450
Don't look for someone else to give you motivation.

23
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.870
Look at yourself,

24
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.890
look at yourself.
And remind yourself why,

25
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.980
why you are doing what you are doing.

26
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.250
Remind yourself that this struggle,

27
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.120
this temporary pain,
this fight,
this fight that you're in,

28
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.420
this is what will make you stronger and faster and smarter

29
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.320
and better

30
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.113
in them.

31
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.960
With that motivation,
go forward

32
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.170
into the fray,
into the storm,

33
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.960
into the heat of the battle

34
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.220
where victory is forged.
