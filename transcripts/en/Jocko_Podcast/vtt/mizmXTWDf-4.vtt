00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.270
This is Jocko podcast number one 33 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.520
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
<v 0>And this podcast will cover a horrific subject.</v>

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.300
Okay.
History.

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.250
And it is not for children or the faint of heart.

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.040
So listener discretion is advised.

8
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.710
<v 0>I am a war criminal.</v>

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.900
I served in men Chuko that phony country created by Japan.

11
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.440
<v 0>In 1992 a group of us</v>

13
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.830
went to China to apologize to the family members of the people we had sent to

14
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:02.760
unit seven 31
one woman.

15
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.780
Now about 60 was the grandchild of one of the victims.

16
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.070
She told us our grandfather was killed by units seven 31 in experiments.

17
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.180
<v 0>He was killed because the Ken p ty sent him.</v>

19
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.640
If you hadn't sent him,
he would've lived.
You are killers.

20
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:27.020
Just like those doctors.

21
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.710
We prostrate ourselves and apology and she kept pressing the fact home that we

22
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:39.000
were partners in crime as guilty as the doctors of unit seven 31

23
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.313
and it's true.

24
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.200
<v 1>Okay?</v>

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.520
<v 0>It is just as she said,</v>

26
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.930
apologizing does not erase the crime.

27
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.670
We were the aggressors.

28
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.620
Most of the Japanese participants in the war were aggressors.

29
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.700
Orders came from above orders from the emperor.

30
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.890
<v 0>Then people were killed because it couldn't be helped.</v>

32
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.900
According to international convention,

33
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.780
those who killed in combat or not criminals,

34
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.930
the 3000 people killed by units,

35
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:26.650
seven 31 were all sent there by the Ken Pti or the police.

36
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.010
The American navy was attacked at Pearl Harbor and the Japanese thought it was a

37
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:39.510
Victoria strike.
Yeah.
Within two years,

38
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.510
America had built up its naval strength.
Again,

39
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.530
America is a machine society,

40
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.700
but bacteriological warfare does not rely on machines.

41
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.150
So each,

42
00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.150
she's idea was to kill the attacking Russians with disease.

43
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.800
Once killed troops are not rebuilt like machinery.

44
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.270
The Japanese to army promised Chinese children money for bringing in rats.

45
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.510
The later gave them a pencil for every rat.

46
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.650
The end purpose of all this effort

47
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.723
<v 1>was war</v>

48
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.680
<v 0>in war.
The side who kills more people wins.</v>

49
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.660
<v 0>Bacteria can kill on a large scale.
So he,</v>

51
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.260
she pressed this forward

52
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.210
and that

53
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.100
his testimony from a Kenty pie officer,

54
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.190
which was kind of like a secret police that served in Japan leading up to and

55
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.570
during World War Two

56
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.993
<v 1>and</v>

57
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.260
<v 0>this is a part of history that,</v>

58
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.600
<v 1>okay,</v>

59
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.270
<v 0>I don't really want to talk about,
no one does,</v>

60
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.420
but of course to ignore it.

61
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.880
<v 0>To think that if we pretend it didn't happen,</v>

63
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.840
that only opens up the door for it to happen again.

64
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.950
So this is the story of unit seven 31 and arm of the Japanese imperial army that

65
00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:35.750
along with some other associated units,
they developed,

66
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.930
tested and deployed chemical and biological warfare weapons.

67
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

68
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.630
<v 0>Then there's two books that I reviewed and we'll be referring to during this</v>

69
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.880
podcast.

70
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.150
One is a unit seven 31 by Pete Williams and David Wallace and the other is unit

71
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:04.030
seven 31 testimony
by how gold

72
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.023
and

73
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.890
the history and the acts that are accounted for in these books really show what

74
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.730
man is capable of.

75
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.900
<v 0>Especially on a malevolent leadership.</v>

77
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.660
And in this case,

78
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.040
the leader that is primarily culpable for the crimes of unit seven 31 is the

79
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:37.400
individual referred to in that opening statement.

80
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.620
A guy named by the name of each,
she shiro,
he,

81
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:45.621
she who was born June 25th,

82
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.540
1892 the fourth son in a wealthy land owning family.

83
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.450
He was a smart,

84
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.070
apparently very smart individual.
He was a big,

85
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:00.230
tall kind of strapping guy.

86
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.450
Then by most accounts he was a pretty arrogant individual as well.

87
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.210
And he went to school to become a doctor and join the army.

88
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.810
And there he studied

89
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.720
<v 1>okay,</v>

90
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.110
<v 0>bacteriology and serology,</v>

91
00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:23.830
which is the study of blood and pathogens in the blood.

92
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.930
And he was also a fiercely patriotic and nationalistic individual.

93
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.100
And what that meant in Japan at this time was a feeling of total superiority,

94
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.020
both a cultural superiority and a racial superiority,

95
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.430
cultural and racial superiority,

96
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.870
superiority over the rest of Asia and really over the rest of the world.

97
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.880
And he moved up through the ranks fairly quickly and he had done some traveling

98
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.960
and of course saw what things that happened in world war one.

99
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.670
And he saw chemical and biological warfare as a way to win wars.

100
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.700
And obviously Japan is a island nation with limited resources and so you need

101
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.960
some advantage.

102
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.510
And he thought the advantage that Japan could get was chemical and biological

103
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:20.344
warfare.

104
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.640
And in order to really maximize that advantage,

105
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.150
he believed that these weapons needed to be tested on people.

106
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.760
<v 0>He believed that human experimentation was the pathway to move ahead of the rest</v>

108
00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:49.620
of the world technologically in these departments.

109
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.800
And oddly enough,

110
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.400
he gained a decent amount of clout and prestige by inventing a water filtration

111
00:08:02.071 --> 00:08:06.750
system that could provide clean water to soldiers on the front line,

112
00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:11.640
which was a really big deal.
And,
and the book,
the book testimony,

113
00:08:11.641 --> 00:08:15.360
the unit seven 31 when he goes into pretty good detail about the number of

114
00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:19.230
people that were killed in wars back then and how many of them would die of

115
00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:24.231
diseases and in malnutrition from being sick from the water having diseases and

116
00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:26.820
whatnot.
And so he developed this,

117
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.450
this filtration system that worked really well and he ended up actually taking

118
00:08:34.651 --> 00:08:37.890
advantage of that a little too much.
And he used that technology,

119
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:41.850
which he'd come up with to get some kickback payments from a commercial company

120
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.700
that manufactured the filters and that kind of got them in some trouble.

121
00:08:44.701 --> 00:08:48.240
But that troubles overcome because he had some political connections that he had

122
00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:51.440
gained and he'd gotten it,

123
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:55.050
got back on path and continue to gain rank and,
and gain.

124
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.020
And with that rank and that stature that he gained,

125
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:06.021
he convinced his leadership to allow him to begin a highly secret program where

126
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.581
he would make and test the biological and chemical weapons.

127
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.040
And again,
at this time,

128
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:23.360
chemical and biological weapons were very politically sensitive.

129
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.080
So this is in the mid 1930 is the end of world war one had had only occurred

130
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.580
just prior to this really 20 years.
And

131
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.090
people remembered those,
those wars,

132
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.280
that war and they remembered the horrors of those weapons.
And,

133
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.670
and that's why international law had forbidden these weapons,

134
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.200
buddy.
She didn't care.

135
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.680
She was there to win at any cost.

136
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.900
And because of the view of the chemical and biological weapons at this time and

137
00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:07.400
the political sensitivity around them,

138
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.670
he couldn't do what he wanted to do inside of Japan

139
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.040
because these weapons are dangerous,
first of all.
But again,

140
00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:16.660
the political sensitivities around them,

141
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:22.070
that was okay because he had other plans and he opened his first laboratory in

142
00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:23.830
Manchuria,

143
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.050
an area of China that was at this time under the brutal control of imperial

144
00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:29.884
Japan.

145
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.230
And the first laboratory that he put together was outside of a city called

146
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:41.940
Harbin.
And interestingly,

147
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.300
the unit maintained a level of cover,

148
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.620
meaning their,
their purpose wasn't made known to the world.

149
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.730
The people they advertise,
the unit that they put in Manchuria,

150
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.850
that it was all about water purification and they,

151
00:10:58.851 --> 00:11:02.870
and they actually did water purification there.
So it was a good cover story.

152
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:04.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.390
<v 0>But what was really being focused on underneath that cover was the creation of</v>

154
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.430
biological and chemical weapons that they could use for war.

155
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.670
And as he,
she

156
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.220
made progression,

157
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.150
the project expanded.

158
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:31.470
And now I'm going to go to the book unit seven 31 by Peter Williams and David

159
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.793
Wallace.

160
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.043
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.090
<v 0>Here we go.
In a few short years each,</v>

162
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:42.970
she's project had hurdled from relative obscurity to one of top secret and

163
00:11:42.971 --> 00:11:46.870
national importance.
It took two years to construct the establishments.

164
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.120
Hundred and 50 or so buildings,

165
00:11:49.121 --> 00:11:52.510
which included a commendation for thousands of people,
a railway siding,

166
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.160
an incinerator and powerhouse with tall cooling towers and animal house in

167
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.003
airfield,

168
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.190
a large administration building and exercise yard and a strange forbidding,

169
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:07.780
square shaped building known as roadblock are.
Oh,

170
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.750
the Japanese character row is square in shape,
hence the name of the building.

171
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.590
Although roadblock looked square from the outside.

172
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.790
Hidden from view in the center were two other buildings known as blocks seven

173
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.933
and eight.

174
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:31.450
Roadblock was the center of bacteria production and disease research block seven

175
00:12:31.611 --> 00:12:34.670
and eight had a more sinister purpose.

176
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.790
You at seven 30 ones bacteriological research division was divided into more

177
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.240
than a dozen squatch each investigating the warfare possibility of a wide

178
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:50.680
variety of diseases,
plague anthrax,
dysentery,
typhoid pair,

179
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.311
typhoid,

180
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:55.810
cholera and many other exotic and unknown diseases were studied.

181
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:57.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

182
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.870
<v 0>Every conceivable facility was given to unit seven 31 so the,</v>

183
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.570
I think that's important because they,
they were getting a lot of money.

184
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.590
This wasn't like a little rogue project that wasn't being supported.

185
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.770
As a matter of fact here.

186
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.220
So two were luxuries lavished on the lifestyle of east.

187
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:22.221
She's researchers and workers in the remote Manchurian plane at Ping Fan.

188
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.710
A whole biological township grew up,

189
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.050
it was known as Togo village.

190
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.520
So around this unit seven 31 there's a whole village that got created and they

191
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:35.100
were all living the good life.
By the way,

192
00:13:35.101 --> 00:13:37.660
while Japan is not living with the rest of Japan is,
you know,

193
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.540
getting ready to go to war or at war in various parts of the world and living

194
00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:45.060
lean,
the here,
they're living large.

195
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

196
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:46.911
<v 0>Back to the book,</v>

197
00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:50.930
Togo villagers had plentiful supplies of the best foods at times when people in

198
00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.930
Tokyo,
we're starving.
Ping Fan was centrally,

199
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.770
he did against the bitter subzero temperatures of the main cheering winter.

200
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.830
Naturally it had the best sanitation,

201
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.490
including even western style style laboratories.

202
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.220
<v 0>So he took care of his people and his people and he were getting taken care of</v>

204
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.900
building a bacterial bacterial weapon.
He,
she found out was not an easy task.

205
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.810
He and his researchers faced a myriad of problems.

206
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:25.050
What kind of micro organisms would make a effective biological warfare agent?

207
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.320
Should it have a lethal or incapacitating effect?

208
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.470
Could it be produced in quantity sufficient for wartime employment?

209
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.910
Could these living organisms be kept kept alive through storage and shipment to

210
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:38.950
their ultimate employment on the battlefield?

211
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.550
What type of munition would be needed to deliver the agent to the target?

212
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.750
What were the technical and military characteristics of such a weapon?

213
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.950
So he started from ground zero trying to figure all this out

214
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.550
as she approached the problem by looking for weapons that could be delivered

215
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:59.690
from altitude by aircraft causing massive outbreaks of epidemics.

216
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.960
Ever since his trip to Europe play get fascinated.
He,

217
00:15:03.961 --> 00:15:05.630
she and I talked about his travel and this is,

218
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.760
they're talking a little bit about that here.

219
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.790
He knew it would make a deadly weapon if it could be harnessed.

220
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.780
It is highly infectious with an incubation period of three to four days,

221
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.620
sometimes up to a week.
The onset is abrupt with chills,

222
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.990
high fever and extreme weakness.

223
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:26.050
The eyes red in the face becomes congested and the tongue coded victims can

224
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:29.840
become maniacally delirious and death may be rapid,

225
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:34.841
sometimes within one day compared with some bacterial pathogens.

226
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.820
Plague is only moderately infectious,

227
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.400
but more virulent strains can be cultivated.

228
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

229
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.890
<v 0>Played could create casualties often out of all proportion to the number of</v>

230
00:15:46.891 --> 00:15:51.891
bacteria disseminated he she deduced therefore that it would make an efficient

231
00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:55.800
weapon said about preparing the most dangerous strains.

232
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.100
And at some point on this podcast we'll talk about the black plague,

233
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.410
which is an epidemic that was insane in Europe.

234
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.050
But when you,
when you,

235
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.370
when you have any knowledge about the black plague and you read about someone

236
00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:13.890
that's looking at it saying,
hey,
this looks like a good idea,

237
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.360
you realize that this is just a sick,
sadistic person.

238
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.010
Plague had another advantage for ICI.

239
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.080
It's origins could be concealed science had not then provided a satisfactory

240
00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:31.230
answer to the age old question of why,

241
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.300
where for how long and how badly a plague epidemic broke out.
So he,

242
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.560
he's just thought,
oh,
this is great.

243
00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:41.190
We can cover it up and play the hits our enemy and we,
we,
you know,

244
00:16:41.191 --> 00:16:42.320
we don't know where it came from.

245
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.103
<v 2>Okay.</v>

246
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.520
<v 0>So they are producing this,
they begin to produce this.</v>

247
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.780
So large was the production plant that in the heyday of unit seven 31 it had the

248
00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:58.680
potential for creating sufficient bacteria to kill the world's population

249
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.480
several times over.

250
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:02.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

251
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:03.480
<v 0>Now that he,</v>

252
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.560
she could produce plague and other virulent bacteria in sufficient quantities

253
00:17:07.561 --> 00:17:08.394
for warfare.

254
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.400
His next task was to discover how he could deliver his deadly microbes to the

255
00:17:13.441 --> 00:17:17.800
enemy.
And obviously I'm not reading this entire book and,

256
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.820
and there's more detail about the process of getting to breed these bacteria

257
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.130
once they figured out how to breed it.

258
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.740
And now we've got to figure out how to deliver it.

259
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.540
How are we going to attack the enemy with this?

260
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.790
He tries all kinds of different things.
And then finally back to the book.
His,

261
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:41.791
I had come to rest upon the humble flee as a nature.

262
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.660
So tune war,

263
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.950
this minute insect could be relied upon as the carrier of pestilence

264
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.450
to yield vast quantities of fleas and feed them enormous numbers of rats had to

265
00:17:55.661 --> 00:18:00.520
be caught and bread.
This was the job of unit seven 30 ones.

266
00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.510
Animal House run by each.
She's elder brother meet Sewell.

267
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.060
There's like a,
as I was reading this,

268
00:18:10.061 --> 00:18:13.960
there's like this whole image of,
I mean are there,

269
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.340
you just think about the,

270
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.750
the reputation of rats and fleas.

271
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:24.830
Rats and fleas are just,
they're the worst.
They're the worst,
right?
Yeah.
And,

272
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:29.020
and it just paints this picture or you just see rats and fleas and this is what

273
00:18:29.021 --> 00:18:33.580
they're breeding.
Yeah.
This could,
this is like a horror movie.

274
00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:37.480
<v 1>Yeah.
At</v>

275
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.630
<v 0>back to the book at times of peak production,
members of each,
she's force.</v>

276
00:18:41.631 --> 00:18:45.030
We're required to dress in civilian clothes and go rat catching.

277
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.920
He found a method suitable for weapons use.

278
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.320
Here's a description of the flea factory.

279
00:18:54.321 --> 00:18:58.580
The second division had four special premises for the mass breeding of fleas.

280
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.510
In which a mix temperature,
a fixed temperature of 30 degrees Celsius.

281
00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:07.100
What's maintained metal jars 30 centimeters high and 50 centimeters wide were

282
00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:09.080
used for the bleat breeding of fleas.

283
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.830
Rice husks were poured into the jars to keep the fleas in.

284
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.420
After these preparations,

285
00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:18.980
a few fleas were put into each jar and also a white rap for them to feed on.

286
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.720
The rat was fastened in such a way as to not hurt the fleas.

287
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.390
It's a horror movie,
but
they,

288
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.370
so they're,
they're going through this process of breeding fleas,
breeding rats,

289
00:19:39.371 --> 00:19:41.030
using the rats to feed the fleas and,

290
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.870
and raise the fleet so that they can put these fleas into containers and they're

291
00:19:43.871 --> 00:19:47.110
trying out all different kinds of containers and how to drop them and how to

292
00:19:47.111 --> 00:19:50.940
spread them.
And as they're figuring all that out,
it,

293
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.990
they're doing other things as well.

294
00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:57.991
And it wasn't just rats and fleas there at unit seven 31 back to the book,

295
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.880
hidden from the outside world at the center of unit seven 30 ones roadblock was

296
00:20:03.881 --> 00:20:06.070
the [inaudible] secret of secrets.

297
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.900
So carefully was its existence kept secret that many junior members of unit

298
00:20:10.901 --> 00:20:13.930
seven 31 had no knowledge that it was there at all.

299
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

300
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.560
<v 0>For prisoners to pass through the tunnel entrance was to start a journey of no</v>

301
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:23.410
return.
Only two things were certain.

302
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:24.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

303
00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.070
<v 0>Agony and death.</v>

304
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.780
Three of the east she brothers and including Taeko Mitsui.

305
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.870
Oh,
and of course the youngest Shiro worked at Ping.
Feign tacky.

306
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.380
Oh,
was the prison commander.

307
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.610
The prisons guards were second or third sons from the east.

308
00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:45.570
She brothers village Kamow.

309
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.590
They were called the special squad tied by bonds of peasant loyalty to their

310
00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:54.930
Lord and Master.
They worshiped him.

311
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:56.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

312
00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.510
<v 0>They called him the honorable Eg or sometimes in reverence war God.</v>

313
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.353
ICI,

314
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:07.010
most were on educated but all were unswervingly loyal to ensure allegiance.

315
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.670
He,
she paid them extra allowances for their terrible and dangerous duties.

316
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.050
The sort of money sent home for which would support whole families through

317
00:21:16.051 --> 00:21:20.310
difficult times to come even pay for their brothers and sisters.
Educations.

318
00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

319
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.500
<v 0>No Chemo villager has ever publicly spoken even today about their former life in</v>

320
00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:29.630
Manchuria.
The village is silent.

321
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.870
The ICI family name is still revered for its kindness.

322
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:38.030
Asked about unit seven 31 older residents will apprehensively reply.

323
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:42.400
I have nothing to say because it concerns the secrets of the honorable Shiro

324
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.283
[inaudible]

325
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:50.270
is she based his unit in remote northern Manchuria so he could experiment on

326
00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:54.510
human beings.
They're in what was a police state.

327
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.810
He could be given an uninterrupted supply of human Guinea pigs with a unique

328
00:22:00.421 --> 00:22:02.590
data gained from the human experiments.
He,

329
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:06.450
she believed Japan could outstrip the rest of the world and developing this new

330
00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:07.320
weapon of war.

331
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.860
No other country would have such accurate details about how [inaudible] epidemic

332
00:22:12.861 --> 00:22:15.470
spread or how to pick it,
protect against them.

333
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.120
Only Japan would fully master the twin fields of biological warfare office and

334
00:22:22.161 --> 00:22:22.994
defense.

335
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

336
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:30.510
<v 0>From the earliest days he,
she appears to have employed human Guinea pigs.</v>

337
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.490
<v 0>It was performed on prisoners who were sentenced to death at Harbin prison.</v>

339
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.020
Each prisoner was placed in a closely guarded cell.

340
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.850
While the experiments took place after death,

341
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.840
the bodies were burned in an electric furnace to leave no trace.

342
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:56.190
By 1935 motion pictures of human experiments were customarily being shown to

343
00:22:56.381 --> 00:22:57.850
senior staff officers.

344
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:00.363
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

345
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.480
<v 0>occupied Manchuria and Harban in particular was an ideal location for supply of</v>

346
00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:09.450
human fodder and I should say that.
So it started off,

347
00:23:09.451 --> 00:23:13.390
they would use prisoners that were sentenced to death and that's,

348
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.580
that's where it started.

349
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.840
But the supply wasn't enough and it escalated from there just to just a normal

350
00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:22.830
people.
And here's where it talks about that a little bit.

351
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.090
Back to the book occupied Manchuria and Harban in particular was an ideal

352
00:23:27.091 --> 00:23:31.080
location for supply of human fodder.
Harbin,

353
00:23:31.081 --> 00:23:35.400
a multiracial city of shifting minority groups was a nest of spies.

354
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:36.811
In addition,

355
00:23:36.811 --> 00:23:40.770
Japan's occupation had brought forth strong resistance from both Chinese

356
00:23:40.771 --> 00:23:45.771
nationalists and Chinese communists as well as indigenous and Mongolians.

357
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.710
There was also a large white Russian population caught in the middle between

358
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:54.320
communist Russia,
an expansionist Japan

359
00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.410
to maintain control in these difficult circumstances was the job of this

360
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:05.470
Japanese secret service agency called the Toca Mu Keychain and the Ken Pti.

361
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.540
They did so through brutal tactics of fear.

362
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:17.240
Anyone who voiced opposition to the self declared declared a paradise of men.

363
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:20.000
Truco was liable to detention.

364
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.930
Many never returned the Japanese secret service guide to the fundamental rules

365
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:31.580
for interrogating war prisoners reveals that world.

366
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.640
So this is a document which I'm gonna read a couple parts of of of how you

367
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:41.000
torture people there.
Their process for torturing people

368
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.000
number 62 sometimes depending on circumstances,

369
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.150
it is advantageous to resort to church torture,

370
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.320
torture,
the infliction.
Number 63 torture.

371
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:58.610
The infliction of physical suffering must be sustained and continued in such a

372
00:24:58.611 --> 00:25:02.690
way that there shall be no other way of relief from suffering except by giving

373
00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:03.800
truthful information.

374
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.270
Torture is advantageous because of the speed with which it is possible with

375
00:25:09.271 --> 00:25:13.560
relative ease to compel persons of week will to give truthful testimony

376
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:14.460
testimony,

377
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.270
but there is danger that in order to relieve himself from suffering or in order

378
00:25:18.271 --> 00:25:19.740
to please the interrogator,

379
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.970
the person interrogated will on the contrary distort the truth.

380
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.620
In the case of a persons of strong will torture,

381
00:25:28.621 --> 00:25:33.621
may strengthen their will to resist and leave ill feeling against the empire

382
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.010
after the interrogation.

383
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.030
In relation to persons of week,

384
00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:42.870
we'll torture is usually applied in those cases when the person interrogated

385
00:25:42.871 --> 00:25:45.960
does not speak the truth even in the face of evidence.

386
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.740
But there is full reason to suppose that this person will speak.
Frankly,

387
00:25:49.741 --> 00:25:51.240
if torture is applied.

388
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:53.970
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

389
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:58.970
<v 0>it is necessary to bear in mind that the methods of torture must be such as can</v>

390
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.520
easily be applied as will sustain suffering without rousing feelings of pity

391
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.780
and as will not leave either wounds or scars.

392
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.670
So let's think about that right there.

393
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.990
What they're saying is that the torture has to be so easy to apply,

394
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.010
that the person that's doing the torturer won't feel sorry for him.

395
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.953
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

396
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:27.080
<v 0>However,
in cases where it's necessary to create the apprehension of death,</v>

397
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.440
the harm caused the person interrogated can be ignored,

398
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.640
but this must be done in such a way as to not make it possible to continue,

399
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.100
not make it impossible to continue the interrogation

400
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:39.960
after the application of torture.

401
00:26:39.961 --> 00:26:43.010
It is necessary to convince the person who has undergone the torture that

402
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:48.110
torture applied to him was quite a natural measure or to take such measures as

403
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:52.290
will induce him out of his sense of pride,
sense of honor,
et Cetera,

404
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:56.160
not to speak about it afterwards.
So that's when you say,
Hey,
look,
we taught you,

405
00:26:56.161 --> 00:27:00.120
you broke and your week and you should be embarrassed about it.

406
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.940
Number 69 nobody must know about this application of torture except the person's

407
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:12.450
concerned with this.
Under no circumstances must other prisoners know about it.

408
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.860
It is very important to take measures to prevent shrieks from being heard.

409
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.493
<v 1>Okay?</v>

410
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:25.410
<v 0>So they had their methodology,
they had their standard operating procedures.</v>

411
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:26.860
<v 1>Okay?</v>

412
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.910
<v 0>To be a spy or dissident in Manchuria was to risk death by firing squad or</v>

413
00:27:30.911 --> 00:27:31.930
decapitation,

414
00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.040
but there wasn't an alternative far worse death at the hands of unit seven 31

415
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.880
unsuspecting and innocent people were also tricked into the clutches of unit

416
00:27:45.881 --> 00:27:50.700
seven 31 somewhere,
Lord,
by the prospect of employment,
young boys,

417
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.530
mothers and children,
even pregnant women were trapped.

418
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.140
<v 1>Okay,</v>

419
00:27:59.140 --> 00:27:59.973
<v 0>here's a,</v>

420
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.260
a medical orderly named [inaudible] who carried out checkups on,

421
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:12.210
and there's a word here [inaudible] and you're going to hear what [inaudible]

422
00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:14.890
says.
This is what they describe.
The people that are being held,

423
00:28:14.891 --> 00:28:19.891
the prisoners inside of unit seven 31 they called them Brutus or Merita

424
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.660
singular.
Right.

425
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

426
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.060
<v 0>And here's what the orderly had to say about it.</v>

427
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:30.360
I started to work for Unit seven 31 at age of 18 in a special section,

428
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.000
which did the press,
the checkups on new prisoners.

429
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:39.310
We took details of their blood type.
It's pulse and pressure and other things.

430
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.020
Prisoners were all referred to as [inaudible],

431
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.920
which is the Japanese word for a log of wood.

432
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.640
Although when they arrived,
they had cards each with their name,
birthplace,

433
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.030
reason for arrest and age.
We simply gave them a number.

434
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:03.420
I'm a,
Rita was just a number,
a piece of experimental material.

435
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

436
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.490
<v 0>They were not even regarded as human beings.</v>

437
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.200
Most were between 20 and 40 years old.

438
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.920
None were over 50 they seem to know their fate.

439
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.910
We did terrible things.

440
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.830
<v 1>Okay,</v>

441
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.550
<v 0>so you can see some obvious dehumanization.
They don't call them people.</v>

442
00:29:27.551 --> 00:29:31.240
They call them logs.
They give them a number,
not a name.

443
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.610
Very standard practice for dehumanization.

444
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.780
Back to the book,
the prison was a vision of hell

445
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.210
through the spy hole cut in the steel doors of each cell,

446
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.300
the plight of the chain where Routas could be seen.

447
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:50.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

448
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:54.200
<v 0>Some had rotting limbs,
bits of bone protruding through the skin,</v>

449
00:29:54.201 --> 00:29:58.250
black and by necrosis.
Others were sweating and high fever,

450
00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.740
writhing in agony or moaning in pain.

451
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.640
Those who suffered from respiratory infectious coughed incessantly.

452
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.060
Some were bloated,
some emaciated,

453
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.000
and others were blistered or had open wounds.

454
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.710
Many of the cells were communal and infected.

455
00:30:15.711 --> 00:30:20.711
Person would be put in with healthy Marita's to see how easily did diseases

456
00:30:20.931 --> 00:30:21.764
spread.

457
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:22.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

458
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:23.950
<v 0>In desperation,</v>

459
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.780
Marucci's would try to practice primitive preventive medicine to escape the

460
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:33.250
diseases
through these little spy holes,

461
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:37.030
the most act,
the most acute symptoms of the worst diseases in the world.

462
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.680
We're coldly observed by seven 30 one's a white coated doctors,

463
00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:44.893
<v 1>okay.</v>

464
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.960
<v 0>Maroon does were used up at the rate of two to three per day.</v>

465
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.200
The dichotomy between the doctors true vocation and the need to build a

466
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:04.201
medically based weapon was well and expediently expressed by an individual,

467
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:09.820
probably she at the initial assembly of unit seven 31 so this is a quote,

468
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.950
our God given mission as doctors is to challenge all varieties of disease

469
00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:19.930
causing microorganisms to block all roads of intrusion into the human body,

470
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:25.050
to annihilate all foreign matter resident in our bodies and to devise the most

471
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.760
expeditious treatments possible.

472
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:29.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

473
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.393
<v 0>However,</v>

474
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:34.840
the research upon which we are now about to embark is the complete opposite of

475
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:39.490
these principles and may cause us some anguish,
has doctors.

476
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

477
00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.170
<v 0>Nevertheless,</v>

478
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.500
I beseech you to Pur pursue this research based on the double medical thrill.

479
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:55.510
One a scientist to exert effort to probing for the truth in the natural science

480
00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:03.190
and research and into and discovery of the unknown world and to as a military

481
00:32:04.761 --> 00:32:09.761
person to successfully build a powerful military weapon against the enemy.

482
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:21.030
One young serologists doctor Akimoto sent from the Tokyo Imperial University to

483
00:32:23.201 --> 00:32:24.610
Manchuria bias professor,

484
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.680
we called the horror of discovering the true purpose of an epidemic prevention

485
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:32.410
and water supply unit.
And here's what he said.

486
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:37.030
I was very shocked when I arrived and found out about the human experiments.

487
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:38.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

488
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.740
<v 0>Very few of those scientists,</v>

489
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.530
<v 2>scientists had a sense of conscious.
Okay.</v>

490
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.580
<v 0>They were treated,
they treated the prisoners like animals.</v>

491
00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:52.020
The prisoners were the enemy.
They would eventually be sentenced to death.

492
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.850
They thought the prisoners would die,

493
00:32:53.851 --> 00:32:58.290
an honorable death if in the process they contributed to the progress of medical

494
00:32:58.291 --> 00:32:59.124
science.

495
00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.600
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

496
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.900
<v 0>I was very frightened.
Although my work involve no human experiments.</v>

497
00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.610
I wrote my resignation three or four times,
but there was no way to get out.

498
00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:09.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

499
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.750
<v 0>I was told that if I left,
I might secretly be executed.</v>

500
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:17.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

501
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:20.430
<v 0>So yeah,
there and I,
this is covered in pretty good depth from the book.</v>

502
00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:24.000
There was like a whole recruiting process to bring the best doctors and

503
00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:27.990
scientists from all the universities in Japan up to Manchuria to work there.

504
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.110
So these young kids are becoming doctors thinking they're going to go out there

505
00:33:31.111 --> 00:33:34.110
and save people.
And the exact opposite happens.

506
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.470
Back to the book.
Syphilis was studied.

507
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.080
Many female Marita's died as unit seven 31 endeavored to solve the venereal

508
00:33:47.081 --> 00:33:51.640
disease epidemics raging through the ranks of imperial Japanese army as its

509
00:33:51.641 --> 00:33:55.660
military hordes Marotta around the Asian continent.

510
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:57.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

511
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.160
<v 0>On one occasion,</v>

512
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:03.300
a pregnant woman was deliberately infected with the disease and when her child

513
00:34:03.301 --> 00:34:06.060
was born,
both were dissected.

514
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.270
Cruel experiments were not confined,
confined to the roadblock.

515
00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:22.410
Five hours from Ping Fan by truck lay Anta proving ground unit seven 30 ones

516
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:30.040
education division trees chief Lieutenant Colonel Nishi took part in one

517
00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:30.730
experiment.

518
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:35.230
Here are his comments and experiment in which I participated was performed in

519
00:34:35.231 --> 00:34:39.280
infecting 10 Chinese war prisoners with gas gang green.

520
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

521
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.980
<v 0>The object of the experiment was to ascertain whether it was possible to infect</v>

522
00:34:44.981 --> 00:34:49.981
people with gas gang green at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius below zero.

523
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.470
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

524
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:54.720
<v 0>This experiment was performed in the following way.</v>

525
00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.090
10 Chinese war prisoners were tied to steaks at a distance of 10 to 20 meters

526
00:35:00.091 --> 00:35:03.600
from a shrapnel bomb that was charged with gas gang green.

527
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

528
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.990
<v 0>To prevent the men from being killed outright.</v>

529
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:13.300
Their heads and backs were protected with a special metal shield and thick

530
00:35:13.301 --> 00:35:17.950
quilted blankets,
but their legs and buttocks or left on protected.

531
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:25.420
The bomb was exploded by means of an electric switch and the shrapnel bearing

532
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:30.620
gas gang green germs scattered all over the spot where the experiment teas,

533
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.633
we're bound.

534
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:38.970
All the experiment teas were wounded in the legs or buttocks and seven days

535
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:42.240
later they died in great torment.

536
00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.820
Miraculously,

537
00:35:52.821 --> 00:35:57.080
some Ruda has survived all infection experiments developing remarkable

538
00:35:57.081 --> 00:36:01.400
immunities,
but their fate was always the same.

539
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

540
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.830
<v 0>Unit seven 31 had many other uses for human fodder,</v>

541
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.400
so they,
they talk about this in the book,

542
00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:14.090
How some people would develop immunity.
Some guys were just super tough,

543
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:18.200
just tough and in fact there's one where they talk about they,

544
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:21.860
they finally kill this guy after experiment.
He's a 65 year old guy.

545
00:36:21.861 --> 00:36:25.850
He was just just tough.
He survived all of these different infections,

546
00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:30.110
all of these different diseases,
and they,
they finally,
when they kill him,
they,

547
00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.340
they opened him up,

548
00:36:31.341 --> 00:36:35.390
they dissect him and they see that he's got the organs of a 25 year old or

549
00:36:35.391 --> 00:36:39.650
something.
But it didn't matter,
even if you were resistant to diseases,

550
00:36:39.651 --> 00:36:41.150
they had other experiments to do

551
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.810
the education chief Nishi had some other recollections about some of those other

552
00:36:47.811 --> 00:36:48.644
experiments

553
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.510
back to the book with temperatures below negative 20 degrees Celsius,

554
00:36:54.511 --> 00:36:57.810
people were brought out from the detachments prison into the open.

555
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:59.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

556
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.870
<v 0>Their arms were Baird and made to freeze with the help of an artificial current</v>

557
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:04.704
of air.

558
00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:05.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

559
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:10.550
<v 0>This was done until they're frozen arms when struck with a short stick emitted a</v>

560
00:37:10.801 --> 00:37:15.120
sound resembling that which a board gives out when it is struck.

561
00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.213
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

562
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.190
<v 0>A film was made on this subject too.</v>

563
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

564
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.100
<v 0>Here's another,</v>

565
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.650
<v 1>yeah.</v>

566
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.830
<v 0>Account of these do.
So they were,</v>

567
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.860
they were trying to figure out things about frostbite,

568
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.280
frostbite and what people could take because they're going to be fighting up in

569
00:37:37.281 --> 00:37:41.180
the steps of Manchuria in Russia.
They thought they'd be fighting there.

570
00:37:41.181 --> 00:37:42.110
So they had to figure out,

571
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:47.470
do experiments to figure out how to heal frostbite once it happened and how much

572
00:37:47.481 --> 00:37:48.770
cold someone could take.

573
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.930
Here's a printer that worked there and here's a uh,

574
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.910
account of what he witnessed.

575
00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:01.330
Two naked men were put in an area 40 to 50 degrees below zero and researchers

576
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:04.490
filmed the whole process until they died.

577
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

578
00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.770
<v 0>They suffered such agony.</v>

579
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.430
They were digging their nails into each other's flesh.

580
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:16.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

581
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.550
<v 0>This was military life.
You couldn't say,
I want to do this or that and war,</v>

582
00:38:21.551 --> 00:38:25.870
however good or bad,
the Japanese way is to obey a superior.

583
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.890
It was the same as if the order came from the emperor.

584
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:36.910
Sometimes there were no anesthetics.
They screamed and screamed,

585
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.770
but we didn't regard the logs as human beings.

586
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.710
They were lumps of meat on a chopping block.

587
00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.560
The Japanese way is to obey a superior.

588
00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.910
I talk about that all the time.
You got a question?

589
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.790
You got a question?

590
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:11.903
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

591
00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.820
<v 0>Continuing detachment.
Seven 31 had a sister unit.</v>

592
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.140
It was called the seven 16 chemical warfare unit.

593
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:25.370
Tests were carried out in a large cloud chamber.

594
00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:29.150
The size of a telephone box made of thick steel.

595
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.440
It had an agitator in the ceiling connected by large pipes to a gas producing

596
00:39:33.441 --> 00:39:34.274
machine.

597
00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:41.370
Maroon is we're putting a truck tied to a pole and pushed inside some naked

598
00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:44.190
summoned,
full army uniform and some and gas masks.

599
00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:50.210
Seven 31 and five 16 researchers watched them gasp and convulse to their deaths.

600
00:39:50.871 --> 00:39:53.820
Through the chambers reinforced to glass window.

601
00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:01.850
A young mother and her baby were even put to death in this chamber.

602
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:09.390
She desperately tried to protect her child from the fumes by covering it with

603
00:40:09.391 --> 00:40:10.224
her body.

604
00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.230
She died lying on top of her child.

605
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.780
Here's another account from a medical
orderly

606
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:34.360
about other experiments beyond cold and beyond,
chemical and beyond.

607
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.340
Beyond biological.
Here we get to malnutrition.
I saw malnutrition experiments.

608
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.920
They were conducted by the project team under the technician Yoshi Mirror.

609
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.780
He was a civilian member of unit seven 31 the purpose of the experiments,

610
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:50.231
I believe,

611
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:54.460
was to find out how long a human being could survive with just water and

612
00:40:54.461 --> 00:40:55.294
biscuits.

613
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.890
Two Maru does were used for this experiment.

614
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:05.110
They continuously circled at prescribed course within the grounds of the unit

615
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.310
carrying approximately a 20 kilogram sandbag on their backs.

616
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.380
One come before the other,
but they both ultimately died.

617
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.600
The duration of the experiment was about two months.

618
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

619
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:27.570
<v 0>They only received army biscuits to eat and water to drink so that they would</v>

620
00:41:27.571 --> 00:41:29.970
not have been able to survive for very long.

621
00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.310
They weren't a lot of sleep

622
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.810
<v 2>either.
Okay.</v>

623
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:40.933
<v 0>And here's</v>

624
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:48.370
one of the major general [inaudible] Kawashima and he talks about the fate of

625
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.270
some of the [inaudible] from 500 to 600 prisoners were consigned to detachment

626
00:41:55.371 --> 00:42:00.371
seven 31 annually if a prisoner survived the inoculation of lethal bacteria.

627
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.260
This did not save him from a repetition of the experiments which continued until

628
00:42:06.261 --> 00:42:09.020
death from the infection supervened

629
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:14.240
the infected people were given medical treatment in order to test various

630
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:18.740
methods of cure.
They were fed normally and after they had fully recovered.

631
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.210
<v 2>Okay.</v>

632
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:24.590
<v 0>Were used for the next experiment,
but infected with a different kind of germ.</v>

633
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:30.080
At any rate,
no one ever left this factory alive.

634
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:32.363
<v 2>Okay.</v>

635
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.440
<v 0>Following anatomical study,</v>

636
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.300
the bodies of the dead were burned and the detachments incinerator.

637
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:43.953
<v 2>Okay,</v>

638
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:49.220
<v 0>so as I said,
there's even if you're just tough as nails,</v>

639
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.880
they're just going to give you a different disease or more disease

640
00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.113
<v 2>and</v>

641
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:03.210
<v 0>all pretty horrible and now it gets worse.</v>

642
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:06.970
Back to the book,

643
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
perhaps the greatest horror of unit seven 31 was vivisection

644
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.250
unit seven 31 had two teams of pathologists,

645
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.820
one headed by Dr Ahca,
Modo,

646
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.880
the other by doctor he she cow

647
00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.120
anatomical study performed by these squads was not always confined to the dead

648
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:43.360
pathology Squat Assistant Kiram Zawa saw vivisections

649
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.820
unit seven 31 did work on living human bodies.
He said,

650
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.553
<v 2>yeah,</v>

651
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.500
<v 0>to do this work.
Our sentiments were suppressed,</v>

652
00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:06.930
so this is a whole new level we're actually dissecting or vivisect and people

653
00:44:08.411 --> 00:44:11.880
that are alive.
Back to the book,

654
00:44:11.881 --> 00:44:15.510
some doctors are said to have come all the way from Japan just to see such a

655
00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:16.344
dissection.

656
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:22.050
Laboratory assistants got extra pay called the chemical weapons allowance for

657
00:44:22.051 --> 00:44:24.420
wielding the scalpel during this dreadful war.

658
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.333
<v 2>Okay.</v>

659
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.320
<v 0>Blood is said often to spurted all over the ceiling of the dissection room as</v>

660
00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:32.790
certain incisions were made,

661
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.770
limbs of the dying Marita's would flex and jerk involuntary out in voluntarily

662
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.580
as the scalpel entered particular parts of the brain.

663
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

664
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:47.000
<v 0>Oregon's would twitch vigorously after they were thrown into jars.</v>

665
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:48.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

666
00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.140
<v 0>Of Formalin for preservation.</v>

667
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

668
00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:56.590
<v 0>Not only were anesthetics researched but also bizarre surgical experiments</v>

669
00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.880
connecting different parts of the body are reported to have been performed.

670
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.983
<v 2>Okay.</v>

671
00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.990
<v 0>So
yeah,
this is,
this is a horror movie that's actually happening.</v>

672
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.680
You got sewing different parts of the body together.

673
00:45:15.681 --> 00:45:19.550
This is just a horror movie except this is not a movie

674
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.410
and
the

675
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:30.620
the people that are being referred to as my route has right now our people

676
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.440
back to the book the world and we'll probably never learn of all the grizzly

677
00:45:37.441 --> 00:45:41.720
experiments that took place at unit seven 31 among them.

678
00:45:41.721 --> 00:45:46.721
More pressure experiments similar to those carried out by doctor ratio at Dachau

679
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.690
concentration camp.

680
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.270
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

681
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.850
<v 0>Presumably done on behalf of the Japanese air force.</v>

682
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:57.770
It was an extremely painful method of killing individual place in the unit.

683
00:45:57.771 --> 00:46:02.771
Seven 31 pressure chamber would suffer terrible agony as their eyes first popped

684
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:08.150
out of their sockets as the I membrane ruptured and later as blood forced its

685
00:46:08.151 --> 00:46:10.640
way out through pores in the skin.

686
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

687
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.830
<v 0>Maroon has had their blood siphoned off and replaced with horse blood and plasma</v>

688
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:26.700
experiments.

689
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:27.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

690
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.630
<v 0>It was said the number of these poor men,</v>

691
00:46:29.631 --> 00:46:33.560
women and children who became route is were mummified alive and total

692
00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:35.090
dehydration experiments.

693
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:39.290
They sweated a death under the heat of hot dry fans.

694
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

695
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.890
<v 0>At death,
their corpse is weighed only one fifth normal body weight.</v>

696
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:50.230
Others were electrocuted,
boiled,
alive,

697
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:55.890
killed and giant centrifuges or died from prolonged exposure to x rays

698
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.320
in all,
some 3000 are said to have been murdered.

699
00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.490
Some were just killed off when there was an excess of supply.

700
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.550
They were killed like animals in APP in an Avatar,

701
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.040
every bit of their bodies mercilessly,

702
00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:20.220
mercilessly used up in the name of the terrible medicine of military science.

703
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.573
Now

704
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:35.140
<v 2>as he,
she went on with these experiments,
he was,</v>

705
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.670
he got worried about something and this is what he got worried about.

706
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.601
Back to the book.

707
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:44.890
There was a small but crucial chance that some of his weapons might not work on

708
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:48.010
American or Anglo Saxon racial groups.

709
00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:57.460
<v 0>In 1943 researcher Ood Sumi was sent on trips to Inner Mongolia to study the</v>

710
00:47:57.711 --> 00:48:00.110
immunities of Mongolians and other races.

711
00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.710
Another had already been sent to a place called moved in,

712
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.310
so mk dons another prison camp.

713
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:12.730
So he got concerned that as he did these experiments that some diseases affect

714
00:48:13.371 --> 00:48:16.970
different races differently.
And there was some chance that,
oh,
we've,

715
00:48:16.971 --> 00:48:21.200
we'd use this type of bacteria against an Anglo Saxon or a white person.

716
00:48:21.201 --> 00:48:24.590
It might not work.
So we got to,
we got to figure that one out.

717
00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:27.981
Well,

718
00:48:27.981 --> 00:48:32.981
the Japanese had captured Americans and Brits and Australians.

719
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.680
So here we're going to hear it a little bit about the prisoners in Mukhsin.
Okay.

720
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:44.950
I said is another prison camp.
Back to the book of Warren W welchol

721
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:50.370
known more familiarly as pappy came from Tulsa,

722
00:48:50.371 --> 00:48:55.371
Oklahoma was a master sergeant with the u s 200 200 coast artillery antiaircraft

723
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.730
regimen on April 9th,

724
00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:03.090
1942 Bhutan fell on May 6th,

725
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:08.810
so to Corregidor pappy Welchol and 88,000 other Americans and Filipinos were

726
00:49:09.721 --> 00:49:10.500
captured.

727
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.120
Pappy remembers it was the beginning of one of the most dehumanizing experiences

728
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.460
ever perpetrated on humans.

729
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:23.830
Well and his fellow prisoners had to endure the familiar ill treatment.

730
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.290
The Japanese made it out to prisoners of war,

731
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.000
a proceeding that is understandable only if you'd,

732
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:34.270
from the Japanese standpoint that to die in battles honorable but to surrender

733
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:35.500
is to be shamed,

734
00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:41.030
but is also dehumanizing because unknown to him,

735
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.620
he was to become a human Guinea pig in Japan's experimental program as they

736
00:49:45.621 --> 00:49:48.020
sought to build weapons of biological warfare,

737
00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.320
Welchol was to spend three years of his life as one of the 1,485 American and

738
00:49:54.411 --> 00:49:58.970
British and Australian and New Zealand prisoners of war who were herded into a

739
00:49:58.971 --> 00:50:02.930
special prison camp in Manchuria at Mukhsin.

740
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:11.090
And of course,
uh,
they hiked there.

741
00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.350
Back to the book,
the root,

742
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:17.150
the 1000 American prisoners took the and began with what became known as the

743
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:21.260
Bataan Death March.
We were subjected to beatings,
killings,

744
00:50:21.261 --> 00:50:24.920
forced marches during the heat of the day.
We were deprived of food,

745
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.860
water in any medical attention whatsoever.

746
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:30.710
Pappy welchol remembered

747
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:41.340
they were penned in two camps in the Philippines.
Hundreds more died,

748
00:50:41.341 --> 00:50:46.341
both in the camp and the s and from suffocation as more than 100 crammed into

749
00:50:46.981 --> 00:50:50.100
boxcars on the journey from one camp to another.

750
00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:54.840
Then in October of 1942 about a thousand US troops had been singled out and

751
00:50:54.841 --> 00:50:57.870
marched to Manila,
the capital of the Philippines.

752
00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:02.880
They went aboard the Japanese vessel territory,
Maru.

753
00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:08.830
And here's a quote from the moment we,
when a board that hell ship,

754
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:11.110
they were experimenting on us.

755
00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.560
They threw us a board to see how much we could stand in,
how many of us died.

756
00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:18.790
They took us from the tropics to a bitterly cold climate and that took its toll

757
00:51:18.791 --> 00:51:19.420
on us.

758
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:23.500
They gave us a few crackers and little rice to eat and I feel that it was a

759
00:51:23.501 --> 00:51:27.790
systematic way of beginning to test us to found out to find out how much the

760
00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:32.791
Americans and the British and Australians could endure and that was said by

761
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:34.780
Greg.

762
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:39.780
Greg Rodriguez senior now retired from his career as a foreman in Henryetta,

763
00:51:41.051 --> 00:51:41.884
Oklahoma.

764
00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:47.460
Rodrigo's was a private in 59 coast or alternately core us army.

765
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:52.210
He survived the journey to move din and three years in the camp itself.

766
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:58.500
Now there's another guy named Robert PD who was a senior British officer and he

767
00:52:01.691 --> 00:52:06.691
was also in prison in moved in and he kept a daily diary or at least he tried to

768
00:52:08.351 --> 00:52:12.310
keep a daily diary and he kept it in code form.

769
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:15.443
Here's some,

770
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.340
here's some of his entries into his journal.

771
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:25.370
19 April 43 another Japanese medical investigated investigation started today as

772
00:52:27.121 --> 00:52:29.940
apparently the findings of the first did not meet with approval.

773
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:32.790
24 may diarrhea is increasing.

774
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:37.590
25 may waiting for medicine for diarrhea,
which was not forthcoming.

775
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:40.290
Men were ordered to exercise by playing baseball.

776
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:42.720
26 may.

777
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:47.130
Diagnosis of diarrhea consists of running the men around the parade ground.

778
00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.050
I saw some of them with bare feet,

779
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:52.830
those who do not mess their pants or drop from exhaustion or reckoned to be

780
00:52:52.831 --> 00:52:54.600
liars and are told to go back.

781
00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.240
A protest has been made and a change is expected in both methods and personnel.

782
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:05.390
For June 3rd Japanese medical investigation started five June antidisciplinary

783
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:09.450
inoculation,

784
00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:14.100
one half cc including flesher y eight June,

785
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.590
diarrhea still steadily increasing.

786
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:22.100
13 June 2nd antidisciplinary shot one cc six August.

787
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:25.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

788
00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:26.100
<v 0>There are now</v>

789
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.540
<v 1>208 dead,</v>

790
00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:46.300
<v 0>so as they're doing these experiments and they've got these dead bodies of</v>

791
00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.970
American,
Australian,
British soldiers.

792
00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:50.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

793
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:55.840
<v 0>They're still trying to utilize them when they're dead to try and learn from</v>

794
00:53:56.511 --> 00:53:59.310
them.
Back to the book,

795
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:04.330
one morning early in 1943 Frank James was assigned to burial detail.

796
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:09.240
This is of some of those bodies.
I was pretty sick myself,

797
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.750
but I wouldn't go to the hospital because nobody that went in ever came out.

798
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:18.720
I went round to the hut and it must have been,
I reckon 340 bodies stacked there.

799
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.960
Each body had a tag attached to its toe.

800
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.870
There were two or three men who I took to be Japanese doctors there.

801
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:31.910
They were all master 100% all the time they were there,
their faces were covered.

802
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.430
Another fellow and I were told to lift up the bodies and put them on the autopsy

803
00:54:37.431 --> 00:54:42.230
tables.
Then they began to cut them open.
They went deep into the stomach,

804
00:54:42.231 --> 00:54:43.760
the bile,
the small intestine,

805
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:47.660
and they took what looked like pancreas and lungs.

806
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:49.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

807
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:52.230
<v 0>They also operated on the heads and took part of the brain.</v>

808
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:02.460
So just a horror film,
a horror show

809
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.460
for the prisoners.

810
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.970
The end of their incarceration in Mulkin was quite matter of fact,
and again,

811
00:55:12.971 --> 00:55:16.720
this is a fast forward and it also skips ahead a little bit talking about how,

812
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:22.570
how the war ended and what that was like.
After days of rumor,

813
00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:27.100
major PDS diary records for August 16th,

814
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:31.060
1945 or six men were brought into camp this evening and from the fact that they

815
00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:34.090
were smoking more than the regulation distance from an ashtray,

816
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.100
we knew they were not prisoners of war.

817
00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:37.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

818
00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.220
<v 0>After an unusually good supper.</v>

819
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.520
All prisoners were released from the guard house.

820
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.600
Then he continues on.

821
00:55:45.601 --> 00:55:49.860
This is on 20 August at about 7:00 PM a small Russian,

822
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:55.520
a small party of Russian officers arrived and announced that we are now free.

823
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.110
The Russian officer in charge said,
here they are.

824
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:05.190
Do what you like with them,
cut their throats or shoot them.

825
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.810
It's all the same to me,

826
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:11.690
but this was translated diplomatically as he says,

827
00:56:11.691 --> 00:56:16.691
he hands them over to you for major PD and the hundreds who had survived the

828
00:56:17.421 --> 00:56:22.010
privations of looped in the victory was there as in every sense

829
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.080
they had no need.
They decided to seek reprisals.

830
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:32.330
It would have been said the major beneath our dignity.

831
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:36.230
It would have reduced us to their level.
After all,

832
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:39.110
they had to live the rest of their lives with what they'd done.

833
00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:48.070
So
the horror show ends and these,

834
00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:53.110
these soldiers that had been tortured and killed,

835
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.220
murdered they,

836
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.270
they decide they're not even going to take revenge because they don't want us.

837
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:01.330
They don't want to lower themselves to that level.
That's an amazing,

838
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.530
but like I said,
that it skipped ahead.

839
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:10.990
The war still wasn't over and here we go.
Back to the book.
He,

840
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:14.440
she expected the final decisive battle would take place between June and

841
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:15.910
September,

842
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:20.740
1945 when America attempted to land on Japan proper Okinawa,

843
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:25.480
Japan's own island Bastian fell in June the month before Germany had
surrendered.

844
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:30.610
Russia urged by Britain and America at Yalta turned their attention to Manchuria

845
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.380
for forces swelled on both sides of the Soviet Manchurian border.

846
00:57:35.381 --> 00:57:38.590
As millions of troops remained at standoff point,

847
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:45.100
Tanaka's flea factory was expanded and given more staff with 4,500 flea breeding

848
00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:48.730
machines and operation.

849
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:53.000
100 million insects could be produced every few days.
He,

850
00:57:53.001 --> 00:57:56.110
she planned to breed 300 kilograms,

851
00:57:56.111 --> 00:58:01.111
approximately 1 billion plague fleas in the runup toward special training

852
00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:04.060
courses in flea breeding.

853
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:09.330
We're set up at Ping Fein in June and sub unit members ordered back afterwards

854
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:14.611
to establish their own production basis to propagate plague cultures and to feed

855
00:58:15.941 --> 00:58:18.790
the fleas.
Rats were needed in their thousands.

856
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:23.940
Yamato ordered every land unit of the quantifying quantong army to track rats.

857
00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.950
Cora Sal was new conveyor system and again I'm throwing names in here that are

858
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.440
explained with a lot more detail in the book.

859
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:38.590
That's why you buy the book and read the book so you can get the full picture.

860
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:42.070
Kurosawa's new conveyor system was working round the clock,

861
00:58:42.071 --> 00:58:45.670
producing plague typhoid,
cholera and anthrax organisms,

862
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:49.420
which were sufficient if correctly dispersed to in fact half the planet.

863
00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.113
<v 2>Okay,</v>

864
00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:02.410
<v 0>between midnight and 1:00 AM on the morning of August 9th after he rose Shima</v>

865
00:59:02.411 --> 00:59:04.510
had been devastated by the atomic bomb.

866
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:09.790
The Soviet army swept across the border into Manchuria and Korea with a massive

867
00:59:09.791 --> 00:59:11.950
force of one and a half million men,

868
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.580
5,500 tanks and 5,000 airplanes.

869
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.000
The tongue army was thrown into panic.

870
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.760
Confusion broke loose that day or the day after.

871
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:27.850
Yamato ordered the destruction of units seven 31 and 100 again.

872
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.730
Seven 31 we've been talking about 100 was another one of these parallel units

873
00:59:31.731 --> 00:59:34.910
that was doing the same type of stuff on nearby.

874
00:59:34.911 --> 00:59:38.690
Sapper unit was ordered to blow up Ping fans,
main headquarters,

875
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.240
the units personnel,
or to destroy all evidence and be evacuated.

876
00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:47.000
Decel Seoul in Korea,
a second bomb was yet to be dropped.
The Maga Saki.

877
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:49.160
So here the wars obviously turning,

878
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:51.950
we dropped the bomb and they go to cover their tracks.

879
00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:57.290
Completely destroy everything,
destroyed the buildings,
destroy all the records,

880
00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:58.190
destroy everything.

881
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:01.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

882
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.590
<v 0>And when I say everything,</v>

883
01:00:02.591 --> 01:00:06.070
I mean everything here we go back to the book at Pink Fan.
Maru does,

884
01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:07.930
we're the first to be destroyed.

885
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

886
01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:13.140
<v 0>Members of the five 16 chemical warfare unit gas.</v>

887
01:00:13.141 --> 01:00:18.141
The Maroon is by throwing flasks of toxic chemicals into their cells.

888
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:23.740
600 local Manchurian in Chinese laborers who worked at the Jaga Sour plant

889
01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:27.360
disease farm and elsewhere.
A Ping Fang.

890
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:32.390
We're machine gunned potassium cyanide poison was also put into the Maroon is

891
01:00:33.361 --> 01:00:34.350
breakfast food.

892
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

893
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:39.470
<v 0>So they're just trying to,
like I said,</v>

894
01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:44.360
destroy everything and make it like it didn't happen.
And as they wrap this up,

895
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:45.561
the rest of units,

896
01:00:45.561 --> 01:00:50.240
seven 31 expecting a few left behind for final clearing up assembled on the 13th

897
01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:53.030
and 14th at the shunting yard each.

898
01:00:53.031 --> 01:00:58.031
She made a formal speech extolling the memory of unit seven 31 and it's diligent

899
01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:02.180
research as if and mockery of him.

900
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.790
It was interrupted by the sound of a prison exploding.

901
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:05.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

902
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.530
<v 0>Members were issued vials of poison.
He,</v>

903
01:01:09.531 --> 01:01:13.480
she had originally wished every branch member in all families in Togo village to

904
01:01:13.481 --> 01:01:17.490
commit suicide,
but this proposal,

905
01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.870
this proposal was met,

906
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:24.260
met the violent disagreement of Major General Kikuchi seven 30 ones research

907
01:01:26.911 --> 01:01:31.000
chief.
Nonetheless,
some took their lives without orders from eg.

908
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:36.160
Three thought fished all kill themselves.
Got a little resistance there.

909
01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.010
I would,
I would have fought that.

910
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

911
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.520
<v 0>Kikuchi perhaps would have provided more resistance.</v>

912
01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

913
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.570
<v 0>Against the behavior that they were occurring to you,
not just to,</v>

914
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.670
you just want to protect himself here at the end.

915
01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.900
Hey,
I'm not going to question anything as long as it doesn't affect me.
Right.

916
01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:00.220
Yeah.
That's what that is.

917
01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:04.810
On August 15th the emperor broadcast Japan's defeat and surrender.

918
01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:08.980
It had never occurred to Isciu that Japan might give in.

919
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:10.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

920
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:15.220
<v 0>He had to confirm the broadcast before believing it such was the shock that</v>

921
01:02:15.221 --> 01:02:19.530
according to one account he,
she was seen in a listless condition utterly falling

922
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.760
that day in the late afternoon units,

923
01:02:22.761 --> 01:02:27.761
seven 31 train arrived at Hinz king there.

924
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:30.420
On the following night,
he,
she made a final address to the,

925
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.390
to his Ernst wild troops.

926
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:39.590
He swore them to life in the shadows for the rest of their lives and the light

927
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:42.570
of the candle held by an aide to Camp II.

928
01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:45.780
She ordered them never to speak of their military past,

929
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:50.010
never to take official positions in the future and never again to contact each

930
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:54.120
other.
It is a promise that some have kept to this day.

931
01:02:56.140 --> 01:03:01.140
The pathetic end of Japan's once mighty biological warfare effort was to let

932
01:03:01.241 --> 01:03:05.410
loose thousands of infected rats in the neighborhood of Ping Fan.

933
01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:09.670
It caused a local plague epidemic,

934
01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.880
which claim to many innocent lives into the summer of 1946 at unit at a hundred

935
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.350
a handful of infected horses were freed after the surrender.

936
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:28.010
Yeah.
You know,
you hear that argument about the,

937
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.440
about the dropping of the atomic bombs.

938
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:36.290
And the common argument is always it would have cost massive amounts of lives on

939
01:03:36.291 --> 01:03:38.090
both sides,
Americans and Japanese,

940
01:03:38.091 --> 01:03:41.120
because the Japanese were going to fight to the death and the Americans were

941
01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:43.850
going to kill them all.
And so the best thing to do is like,
okay,

942
01:03:43.851 --> 01:03:44.710
we dropped the atomic bomb.

943
01:03:44.711 --> 01:03:49.580
So this just kind of makes that a closed deal in my mind.
You know,

944
01:03:49.581 --> 01:03:50.690
you got people that are trying to,

945
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:55.280
they got enough enough biological weapon treated in fact half the world.

946
01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.700
So,
and again,
jumping forward in this book,

947
01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:05.020
get the book so that you can get the whole story.
But there's a,

948
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.020
a massive investigation that takes place to find out what's going on.

949
01:04:09.021 --> 01:04:12.560
There's little leaks.
They,
they catch wind of a little of it,
but not a lot of it.

950
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.980
And at one point they're interrogating each sheet.
And here's east,
she,
he,

951
01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:20.990
she denied any involvement.
Our work was to protect soldiers.
He said,

952
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.700
did anyone else concerned themselves with biological warfare against crop
plants?

953
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.740
I do not know.
Replied each sheet.

954
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:31.910
His interrogator made no effort to pursue the matter.
Thompson,

955
01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:36.590
a veterinarian by training turned the questions of biological warfare against

956
01:04:36.591 --> 01:04:40.670
animals.
We did not do any experiments on log.

957
01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:44.690
Large animals said he she.
We use small animals as test animals.

958
01:04:44.691 --> 01:04:47.030
Besides we had no veterinarians.

959
01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:54.780
What field tests were made with the plague organism?
He asked,

960
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:58.920
due to the danger of it,
there were no field experiments with that organism.

961
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:02.640
There were a great many field mice and Manchuria and it would have been

962
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:06.450
dangerous to conduct field experiments with plague because the field mice would

963
01:05:06.451 --> 01:05:09.330
very easily carry the organisms and start an epidemic.

964
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.360
We conducted the experiments with plague in the laboratory,

965
01:05:12.361 --> 01:05:16.140
set each she what kind of experiments?
Thompson inquired.

966
01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:20.020
We put rats in cages inside the room and sprayed the whole room with plague

967
01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:24.190
bacteria.
This was to determine how the rats became infected,

968
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:26.710
whether through the eyes,
nose,
mouth,
or through the skin.

969
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:30.220
What did you find out the test results were not too favorable.

970
01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.370
We usually got 10% infection,
by which way?

971
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:36.430
That was the total said he she misunderstanding the question.

972
01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:40.510
What route was most effective?
Thomson repeated through the nose,
said he,

973
01:05:40.511 --> 01:05:44.620
she also through an open wound,
so they're interrogating.

974
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.610
He's being pretty,
he's lying,

975
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.890
he's covering up.
But there's,

976
01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:54.880
there's a twist that we're going to see unfold here and I'll explain it a little

977
01:05:54.881 --> 01:05:57.580
bit so it makes sense as it comes forth.

978
01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:03.570
The twist in this story is that the Cold War was about to start.

979
01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:08.950
The Cold War was now starting and America,

980
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:14.200
these experiments that had taken place and knowledge had been gained through

981
01:06:14.201 --> 01:06:17.320
this,
through these evil experiments.
Well,

982
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:21.430
America looked at the knowledge and recognized or saw that there could be

983
01:06:21.431 --> 01:06:23.530
knowledge that they didn't,
that we didn't have,

984
01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:27.400
that America didn't have and and decided,

985
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:32.800
let's try and get this knowledge.
Now,
one of the problems is,

986
01:06:32.801 --> 01:06:36.220
and again this is going to unfold,
but I'll give a brief synopsis of it.

987
01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:41.230
One of the problems is if you charge someone with war crimes and you put them on

988
01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:41.800
trial,

989
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.070
well you've got to stay with their own what the war crimes that they committed.

990
01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:50.440
And if you say that the war crimes were committed were these experiments with

991
01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:53.290
chemical and biological weapons,
then people are going to know

992
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.840
what the results of the experiments were and that means the knowledge is going

993
01:06:58.841 --> 01:07:02.650
to be out there and the knowledge could fall into the hands of people that we

994
01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:07.651
were now looking to be facing in another war,

995
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.540
which ended up being the Cold War.
Luckily not a full war.
So

996
01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:18.870
that's how this,
that's how this story continues to unfold.
Back to the book,

997
01:07:18.871 --> 01:07:19.740
there's no question that he,

998
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:23.700
she has an India as an individual and many of his associates were guilty of

999
01:07:23.701 --> 01:07:26.760
serious war crimes.
As a lieutenant general,
he,

1000
01:07:26.761 --> 01:07:31.761
she was an ICI undoubtably possessed sufficient high military rank to be

1001
01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.260
classified as a class a war criminal.

1002
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:37.920
He was the top of the tree in his own field.

1003
01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:42.690
His actions as the head of unit seven 31 qualified him as a criminal on many

1004
01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:43.524
accounts.

1005
01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:49.790
Not only was biological warfare considered extra legal by most countries,

1006
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.630
but issue is also guilty of outrageous conventional war crimes.

1007
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:58.680
He had carried out calculated human experimentations on prisoners of war,

1008
01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:02.550
a conventional war crime that had long been prescribed in the manuals of

1009
01:08:02.551 --> 01:08:07.551
military law of every major power he'd carried out similar research against

1010
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.290
innocent civilians,
clearly a crime against humanity.
These,

1011
01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:16.400
she had taken his biological weapon out of the research laboratory and used it

1012
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:17.234
in the field.

1013
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.590
He had sought autonomy and independence of action for his biological warfare

1014
01:08:21.591 --> 01:08:23.480
forces throughout the war zones.

1015
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.250
He had done nothing to restrain the conduct of his subordinates.

1016
01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:30.710
So this guy is as guilty as they come.

1017
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:38.330
They they are was other

1018
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:45.670
other events that took place that were equally bad.

1019
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.000
And here we go.
Some tribunals were held in China,

1020
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.500
the Philippines and the Pacific islands,

1021
01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:56.390
but most a total of 314 cases were held at Yokohama.
Japan.

1022
01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.340
At these courts,

1023
01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:02.120
a sufficient number of medical atrocity cases were heard for them to be

1024
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:04.400
considered as a special category.

1025
01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.680
The most well known and worst case presented by legal section at Yokohama

1026
01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.900
concerned the fate of captured American flyers held by the Japanese western army

1027
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:18.620
in Kyushu after April,

1028
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.550
1945 the appalling experiments to which they had been subjected included

1029
01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:27.050
vivisection and the substitution of seawater for their blood.

1030
01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:30.873
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1031
01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.460
<v 0>For this gross act of barbarism on August 27th,</v>

1032
01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:40.630
1948 the nine Japanese involved were convicted and sentenced either to be hanged

1033
01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:42.490
or to serve life in prison.
Mint.

1034
01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1035
01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.160
<v 0>One professor,
he,</v>

1036
01:09:47.161 --> 01:09:52.161
she yama of Kishu University committed suicide in prison.

1037
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:53.683
So

1038
01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.840
clearly they had the attitude of like,

1039
01:09:58.841 --> 01:10:02.470
we're going to get some of these guys that conducted experiments and that's

1040
01:10:02.471 --> 01:10:06.430
exactly what should it should happen.
And this was a much smaller number

1041
01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.130
of people that were tortured and killed and uses human experiments than what was

1042
01:10:12.131 --> 01:10:14.210
used it at seven 31

1043
01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.400
continuing on Cold War,

1044
01:10:20.401 --> 01:10:25.401
tensions had been increasing throughout 1946 the desire to meet out stern

1045
01:10:26.011 --> 01:10:31.011
justice at the Tokyo trial was increasingly subsumed if found in conflict with

1046
01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:35.880
the interests of national security.
Japan was in the front line.

1047
01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.970
So to now was biological warfare on August 24th,

1048
01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:46.260
1946 Washington cabled MacArthur ordering him to protect intelligence,

1049
01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:50.730
especially scientific,
which might jeopardize America's national security.

1050
01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.580
It red under present circumstances,

1051
01:10:53.581 --> 01:10:56.850
intelligence relating to research and development in the field of science and

1052
01:10:56.851 --> 01:11:01.851
war material should not be disclosed to nations other than the British

1053
01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:02.723
Commonwealth.

1054
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:03.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1055
01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.830
<v 0>Biological Warfare Intelligence seems by this time to become too much too</v>

1056
01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:12.120
sensitive to be brought into the glare of massive of a massive international

1057
01:11:12.121 --> 01:11:17.121
trial throughout 1946 in both Russia and America appear to have been reluctant

1058
01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:19.800
to reveal their hands in Japan.

1059
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:24.750
America appears to have taken some extra precautions to prevent information from

1060
01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:26.070
falling into Soviet hands.

1061
01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.353
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1062
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.620
<v 0>so you can see how it's unfolding.
One of these,
again,</v>

1063
01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:37.260
one of these senior officers that is talked about deeply in the book,

1064
01:11:37.261 --> 01:11:39.480
but I didn't discuss too too much.

1065
01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:42.330
His name was NATO.

1066
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1067
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:47.680
<v 0>And here's a quote from NATO.
We want to cooperate,</v>

1068
01:11:48.490 --> 01:11:49.010
<v 2>okay.</v>

1069
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:51.680
<v 0>And we owe it to the general headquarters,</v>

1070
01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.050
but we have a responsibility to our friends.

1071
01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.100
We took an oath never to divulge information on human experiments.

1072
01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.430
We are afraid to,
some of us will be prosecuted as war criminals.

1073
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:05.810
We do not know how much others will be willing to give us.

1074
01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:10.010
If you can give us documentary immunity,

1075
01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.330
probably we can get everything.
The subordinates,

1076
01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:16.940
not the section chiefs know all the details.

1077
01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:21.350
If we contact someone who is a communist,
he is liable to tell the Russians.

1078
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:23.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1079
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:28.750
<v 0>The Japanese were given insurances that war crimes would not be involved.</v>

1080
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.780
Macarthur send a five again,

1081
01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:40.470
fast forward from Macarthur said a five part radio message to Washington showing

1082
01:12:40.471 --> 01:12:44.070
the extent of his knowledge.
It's clear from part five they have the whole,

1083
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.050
the whole message in the book.

1084
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:49.680
It is clear from part five of the message that Macarthur favored gaining the

1085
01:12:49.681 --> 01:12:52.560
biological warfare technical information by offering.

1086
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:57.561
The asserts is that data would not be in ployed at war crimes trials

1087
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:04.980
and here's the she.
I will not reveal the information to the Russians.

1088
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:09.403
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1089
01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.510
<v 0>can see how this is unfolding.
This is like one of those horrible,</v>

1090
01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:16.110
when a crime gets committed in for whatever little technicality people are

1091
01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:19.560
getting off,
that's exactly what's going on.
And you can hear it on folding.

1092
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:20.663
And I mean,

1093
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:28.350
does national security Trump the,
it's almost like an ego move,
right?

1094
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.660
It's almost like an ego move.
You're gonna make these guys pay.

1095
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.190
It's also a morality move and it's a justice.
It's a,

1096
01:13:34.191 --> 01:13:37.800
I guess it's beyond ego and beyond route.
It's justice.
These guys were criminals,

1097
01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:42.390
these guys per did heinous things to other human beings and they should pay and

1098
01:13:42.391 --> 01:13:45.440
is as strong as that case is.
It,

1099
01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:48.630
it didn't seem to hold up to the case of national security.

1100
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:52.320
We want to have this information,
not that we were going to use it.
Yeah.

1101
01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:53.203
<v 2>But</v>

1102
01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:57.500
<v 0>we better have it better to have it and not need it than need and not have.</v>

1103
01:13:57.501 --> 01:14:00.950
It's better to have it yourself and not let your enemy habit,

1104
01:14:00.951 --> 01:14:02.840
which is the Russians at this point.
Yeah.

1105
01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.150
So that's where the decisions getting made.
Yeah.

1106
01:14:05.151 --> 01:14:09.680
So you got to kind of consider what's more important like this justice.
Yeah,

1107
01:14:09.681 --> 01:14:12.850
that's exactly the question.
And answers pretty clear what the,

1108
01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:16.060
what the answer is is safety,
right?
The,
I mean,

1109
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:21.040
security I got to,
you can get all the justice.

1110
01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:22.750
Yeah,
you can get all the justice you want,

1111
01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:25.780
but then it was going to create some serious problems in the future.

1112
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:28.570
It's Kinda like,
you know,
is it worth it?
Yeah.

1113
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.240
And here's what she talking some more.
I cannot give detailed technical data.

1114
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:36.100
All the records were destroyed.

1115
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:39.670
I never did know many details and I've forgotten what I knew.

1116
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:44.880
I can give you general results I've never heard of onto that's another,
uh,

1117
01:14:44.970 --> 01:14:49.970
base that they used until I returned to pink fan in 1945 I did not visit the

1118
01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:53.680
location.
I am responsible for all that went on at Ping Fan.

1119
01:14:53.681 --> 01:14:55.750
I'm willing to shoulder all responsibility.

1120
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:59.620
Neither my superiors or my subordinates had anything to do with issuing

1121
01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:02.920
instructions for experiments.
If you ask me specific questions,

1122
01:15:02.921 --> 01:15:04.750
I can tell you general results.

1123
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.220
I am wholly responsible for paying fan.

1124
01:15:08.221 --> 01:15:11.700
I do not want to see any of my subordinates or superiors get in trouble for what

1125
01:15:11.701 --> 01:15:16.590
occurred.
If you will give me documentary immunity for myself,

1126
01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.590
superiors,
subordinates and subordinates.

1127
01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:22.290
I can get you all the information for you.

1128
01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:28.110
So He's,
he's making a deal.
He's making deals and look,

1129
01:15:28.111 --> 01:15:31.560
I'm responsible for everything.
And what he's doing is saying,
look,

1130
01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:34.770
I'm responsible for everything and if you give me immunity,

1131
01:15:34.771 --> 01:15:36.240
I'll get you all the information you want.

1132
01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.173
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1133
01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.770
<v 0>He's actually a good move.</v>

1134
01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:43.320
It's a good move on his part because he says I'm responsible for everything.

1135
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:47.010
Even if they say,
no,
we don't take a deal and we're going to hang you.
He's still,

1136
01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:51.000
he's still trying to protect as many as many of his people as he can up and down

1137
01:15:51.001 --> 01:15:51.834
the chain of command.

1138
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.863
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1139
01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:58.090
<v 0>The advisability of complying with issues,</v>

1140
01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:59.980
bargain war crimes,

1141
01:15:59.981 --> 01:16:04.981
immunity in written form in exchange for scientific data was to occupy some of

1142
01:16:05.321 --> 01:16:08.800
Washington's most senior minds throughout the summer of 1947 he,

1143
01:16:08.801 --> 01:16:13.120
she continued Masuda,
Kaneko and NATO,

1144
01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:16.810
whom you say,
you know,
can give you a lot of information.

1145
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:21.790
I would like to be hired by the United States as a biological warfare expert in

1146
01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:23.710
preparation for the war with Russia.

1147
01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:27.820
I can give you the advantage of my 20 years research and experience.

1148
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.300
I have given a great deal of thought to tactical problems in the defense against

1149
01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:32.410
biological warfare.

1150
01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.090
I have made studies on the best agents to be employed in various regions and in

1151
01:16:37.091 --> 01:16:40.930
cold climates.
I can write volume of the ball,
biological warfare,

1152
01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:45.880
including the little fault of strategic and tactical employment.
God,

1153
01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:47.590
this Guy Scumbag,

1154
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:57.770
so it continues and open back to the book and an open admission about human

1155
01:16:57.771 --> 01:16:59.680
experimentation.
Allegations about the,

1156
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:03.490
the use of biological warfare even hints about the connection between units

1157
01:17:03.491 --> 01:17:07.910
seven 31 and a member of the Japanese imperial family were all contained in the

1158
01:17:07.911 --> 01:17:12.550
files of legal case three 30 by the middle of 1947 yeah.

1159
01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.980
How did this come about and why was nothing be done being done about the file's

1160
01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:22.420
contents?
So this is getting shut down.
That's what's happening.
Now.

1161
01:17:22.421 --> 01:17:23.980
Here's the sort of the more

1162
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:28.390
official opinion back to the book on balance.

1163
01:17:28.391 --> 01:17:32.680
The sub committee felt it was desirable to avoid a war crimes prosecution.

1164
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:33.760
And here's what they said.

1165
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.380
Since it is believed that the USSR possesses only a small portion of this

1166
01:17:38.381 --> 01:17:39.520
technical information,

1167
01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.760
and since any war crimes trial would completely reveal such data to all nations,

1168
01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:50.080
it is felt that such publicity must be avoided in interests of defense and the

1169
01:17:50.081 --> 01:17:53.200
security of the United States.
It is believed,

1170
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:58.450
it is believed also that war crimes prosecution of ICI and his associates,

1171
01:17:58.690 --> 01:18:03.490
which serve to stop the flow of much additional information of a technical and

1172
01:18:03.491 --> 01:18:04.810
scientific nature.

1173
01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:11.170
It is felt that the use of this information as a basis for war crimes evidence

1174
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:16.150
would be a grave detriment to Japanese cooperation with the United States

1175
01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:18.610
occupation forces in Japan.

1176
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:26.450
So there you hear the decisions getting made and that's the way it went.

1177
01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:29.620
And in the end,
going back to the book,

1178
01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:34.650
No member of unit seven 31 was called before any British or American military

1179
01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:39.130
tribe tribunal to account for war crimes.

1180
01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.670
<v 2>None of them.
Well</v>

1181
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:47.660
<v 0>actually not by any British or Americans because the Russians,</v>

1182
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:51.590
they still went after him and they,
and one,
they went after him,

1183
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.240
then they got some of them,
they,

1184
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:57.950
they made America look bad and they had a big trial.
And here's the,

1185
01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:02.660
the State Council and the state councils name was Smirnoff.

1186
01:19:02.690 --> 01:19:03.970
And here we go.
Back to the book smear.

1187
01:19:03.971 --> 01:19:07.280
Nofx spelled out a message intended for the ears of an audience.

1188
01:19:07.281 --> 01:19:12.140
Thousands of miles from the courtroom.
These men,
he,
she and the rest.

1189
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:14.390
Now you,
she wasn't a part of this trial,
but he,

1190
01:19:14.391 --> 01:19:19.130
she and the rest enjoy the protection of those reactionary forces in the

1191
01:19:19.131 --> 01:19:24.131
imperialist camp who are themselves dreaming of a time when they will be able to

1192
01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:25.970
hurl upon mankind.

1193
01:19:25.971 --> 01:19:30.350
Loads of TNT atomic bombs and lethal bacteria.

1194
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
The accused received the sentences as follows and then they listed these guys

1195
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:39.480
for that various,
uh,

1196
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:44.650
soldiers and civilians that served in some of these biological warfare

1197
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:50.600
experimentation centers.
They got 25 years,
20 years,
18 years,

1198
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.320
15 years,
12 years,
10 years.
Two years.
Three years.

1199
01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:55.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1200
01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.540
<v 0>But again,
those sentences don't include he,</v>

1201
01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:04.710
she or the other main players at unit seven 31 cause they got kind protected,

1202
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:09.570
not even kind of,

1203
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:14.280
they are protected by America in exchange for their information.

1204
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:20.640
Sort of in response to everything that was going on there.
On December 27th,

1205
01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.000
1941 the following story appeared in the New York Times datelines Tokyo.

1206
01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:27.180
No Knowledge.
Macarthur says General Macarthur,

1207
01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:29.670
General Douglas Macarthur is headquarters said today.

1208
01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:34.050
There were no known cases in which Japanese she used American prisoners in germ

1209
01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:35.160
warfare experiments.

1210
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.990
The headquarters added that the Japanese had done some experiments with animals,

1211
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:44.190
but that there was no evidence they had ever used human beings.

1212
01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:46.770
As far as is known here,

1213
01:20:46.771 --> 01:20:49.350
no Americans held prisoner by the Japanese sent mucked in,

1214
01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:53.790
ever accused their captors of having used them as Guinea pigs in biological

1215
01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:55.470
warfare tests.

1216
01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:01.830
So that's all not true.
That's all not true.

1217
01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.320
Back to the book to this day,

1218
01:21:04.321 --> 01:21:08.430
Russia has allowed itself to Baskin feelings of more moral superiority over

1219
01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:13.431
America and not without some justification in respect of the way it brought it's

1220
01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:17.250
unit seven 31 criminals to justice.

1221
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:23.580
So just that's the way,
that's the way it flushed out.

1222
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:29.580
Now
this,
you might think that's a little disturbing.

1223
01:21:29.581 --> 01:21:34.470
This is equally disturbing.
This is just horrible.
Back to the book.

1224
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.790
After the war,
most of the scientists of units,

1225
01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:40.080
seven 31 prospered.

1226
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1227
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:45.770
<v 0>Much is explained by the clear complicity on the part of the United States</v>

1228
01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.800
authorities in the war crimes of unit seven 31 did it attachments,

1229
01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.670
civilian researchers and other associated scientists were quite free to return

1230
01:21:55.671 --> 01:21:56.720
to academia.

1231
01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1232
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:59.600
<v 0>And it goes through this lit,</v>

1233
01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:03.540
this multiple page list of,

1234
01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:08.210
of guys that went on to work at the research institute for Natural Resources

1235
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.960
Chief.

1236
01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.770
And he and another guy was chief research section at a pharmaceutical company.

1237
01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:13.933
Um,

1238
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:19.270
doctor each she cow once a pathologist at unit seven 31 who had brought home

1239
01:22:21.321 --> 01:22:23.840
within thousands of human pathological samples,

1240
01:22:23.841 --> 01:22:28.841
became a professor at a university in 1944 a position he held throughout the

1241
01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.400
1960s and seventies.

1242
01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:34.820
He eventually became president of the university's medical school,

1243
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:41.050
the local newspaper once plan to award him with a metal for his contribution to

1244
01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:46.280
society.
But after students who knew of his wartime record objected,

1245
01:22:46.281 --> 01:22:49.670
the ward was canceled.
So these guys carried on another guy,

1246
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:51.290
professor of

1247
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:55.700
show a university or pharmacological,

1248
01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.710
another professor of bacteria logically at Kyoto University.

1249
01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.260
The list goes on
on,

1250
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:11.290
on doctor [inaudible] Yoshimura who directed units seven 31 to frostbite

1251
01:23:14.261 --> 01:23:17.050
experiments.
Literally freezing people to death,

1252
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.740
became a faculty member at the Kyoto Prefectural Medical College in the 1950s

1253
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:27.570
and later it's president.
And

1254
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.600
like I said,
that list goes on and on and on.

1255
01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:37.230
And of course we still haven't heard about east yet.

1256
01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:41.260
The mastermind behind this whole thing.
Here we go back to the book,
he,

1257
01:23:41.261 --> 01:23:45.180
she inherited much of a family's property in came Oh village.

1258
01:23:45.181 --> 01:23:48.720
Cause if you remember Kamal villages where they bring all these prison guards

1259
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:52.050
from their home village so that they'd get the complete loyalty from him.

1260
01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:55.670
So he inherited much of the properties,
family,
the family property and came,

1261
01:23:55.671 --> 01:23:57.750
Oh village.
His two elder brothers,

1262
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.070
Takeo and Mitsui [inaudible] were childless.

1263
01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.700
Unlike Shiro who fathered six children TKO units.

1264
01:24:04.701 --> 01:24:09.120
Seven 31 special prison squad leader eventually died of liver cancer and Koby

1265
01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.820
the city wants his second wife had come

1266
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.570
Mitsui [inaudible] who wants supervise the the units.

1267
01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:21.600
Animal House outlived his younger brother's Shiro but was unable to work after

1268
01:24:21.761 --> 01:24:26.761
the war and lived on money gained by selling his country property which Solo

1269
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:32.280
Mitsu and take Yale and their eldest brother terrail who had been killed in the

1270
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:33.603
Russo.

1271
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:39.090
Japanese war during Japan's Meiji period are buried in the ICI family cemetery

1272
01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:43.990
at Chemo on August 17th,

1273
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:48.990
1958 13 years after the end of the war in the back room of a stone mason shop

1274
01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:52.950
near Thomas Cemeteries Tokyo each.

1275
01:24:52.951 --> 01:24:57.790
She made his first and apparently only postwar appearance before assembled

1276
01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:00.130
junior members of his former unit.

1277
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:06.930
He reminisced about the early days of unit seven 31 in a speech reportedly still

1278
01:25:08.711 --> 01:25:11.530
rich and xenophobia and elite Ism II.

1279
01:25:11.531 --> 01:25:15.970
She described how his unit was to have been the salvation of Japan,

1280
01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:21.680
a country then encircled by the west,
scientifically impro impoverished,

1281
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:26.240
yet spiritually rich.
He apologized for their suffering since the end of the war,

1282
01:25:26.241 --> 01:25:31.241
but urged his audience to remain proud of the memory of units seven 31

1283
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:38.790
then here's a little part of his,
what he said,

1284
01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:43.791
it was an order that we could have precious human material that the unit seven

1285
01:25:44.191 --> 01:25:48.780
31 was set for the saving of the nation

1286
01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:52.990
national circumstances.
We're not permitting,

1287
01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.090
unfortunately we did not achieve our aims.

1288
01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:03.060
So even after all that,

1289
01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:10.020
even after all that,
even looking back after 13 years after the end of the war,

1290
01:26:10.021 --> 01:26:15.021
he's looking back and still has the same mindset and that mentality is hard to

1291
01:26:15.991 --> 01:26:19.230
understand and I want to shed a little bit of light on that mentality.

1292
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:21.583
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1293
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:24.080
<v 0>And do that through some,
uh,</v>

1294
01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:28.850
personal accounts of what happened at unit seven 31.

1295
01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:32.960
And that's from this other book.
It's called unit seven 31 testimony.

1296
01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.640
Then let's go to this book that I think these make it pretty clear where this

1297
01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:44.600
mentality comes from.
So

1298
01:26:46.190 --> 01:26:51.140
this account is from a captain in the Japanese imperial army named [inaudible],

1299
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:55.040
Kajima Tec,
Eo.
And here we go.

1300
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:59.000
Perhaps there are some people here and,
and by the way,

1301
01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:04.030
most of these accounts are from an exhibition that went around Japan,

1302
01:27:05.241 --> 01:27:08.450
kind of explaining what happened and people would come to this exhibition.

1303
01:27:08.451 --> 01:27:12.200
Then they would capture if someone was involved in unit seven 31 or someone

1304
01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:14.900
remembered her,
someone had a story about it,
they would capture their account.

1305
01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:20.140
And that's what this book has a lot of from this expert that this exhibition

1306
01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:23.360
that they did,
I think it was in the mid 1990s at,
they did this exhibition.

1307
01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.610
So this particular person that was showed up at this exhibition,

1308
01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:33.250
he was a captain and the Japanese army,
his name is [inaudible].

1309
01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:35.533
And here's what he said.

1310
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.720
Perhaps there are some people here at this unit seven 31 exhibition who think

1311
01:27:41.181 --> 01:27:44.030
that this was all there was to Japan,

1312
01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:49.060
Japanese aggression at the time unit seven 31 was merely one segment of the dark

1313
01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:53.900
shadow of Japan's aggression.

1314
01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.350
And I would like to tell of my experience in this,

1315
01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:02.330
and I think this is why I pulled this one specifically because this talks about

1316
01:28:02.331 --> 01:28:07.130
where this came from,
where this mentality came from,
that he,
she had to the end.

1317
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:12.320
We were born and raised in a society of empiricism.

1318
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.020
A person's absolute responsibility above the army and government was to the

1319
01:28:18.021 --> 01:28:20.870
emperor.
The emperor was a living deity.

1320
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:26.060
The emperor's command was supreme and controlled the entire country.

1321
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:29.990
We were told how we must serve the emperor,

1322
01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:33.140
how we should behave toward our parents,
how should we,

1323
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:37.910
we should behave quarter teachers and how we should behave toward our siblings.

1324
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:41.960
We were taught that Japan is a sacred country,

1325
01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:46.370
that the people of Japan are a superior race,
that the people of China,

1326
01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.653
Korea,

1327
01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:52.660
Southeast Asia and Russia were all inferior races and the superior race must

1328
01:28:54.081 --> 01:28:58.520
govern them and by doing so we would bring them happiness.

1329
01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.310
This was the cause to which Japan must devote itself

1330
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:07.040
and then he goes on.
Again,
I'm not reading the entire thing,

1331
01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:10.670
but you have to get the book to get these entire accounts.

1332
01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:15.560
Soon after we went into service,
we were given training to get our courage up.

1333
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:18.470
We were ordered to watch beheadings.

1334
01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:24.340
Chinese were made to sit by a hole in the ground and the seasoned soldiers would

1335
01:29:24.531 --> 01:29:25.730
cut their heads off.

1336
01:29:27.690 --> 01:29:28.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1337
01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:32.650
<v 0>Blood spurted up from the neck into the air and the bodies would roll into the</v>

1338
01:29:32.651 --> 01:29:35.950
holes.
Then we had bay in that practice.

1339
01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1340
01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:42.090
<v 0>Victims had their hands tied behind them around a tree and were used as band net</v>

1341
01:29:42.091 --> 01:29:42.924
targets.

1342
01:29:43.730 --> 01:29:44.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1343
01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:46.240
<v 0>We had to watch this as part of our training.</v>

1344
01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.440
This was a shock to me and for two or three days,

1345
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.480
food would not pass through my throat.
What?
Two years later,

1346
01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:00.600
I became an officer in charge of a platoon and with about 25 men under me.

1347
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:02.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1348
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.820
<v 0>Later I became a company commander with 151 men,</v>

1349
01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.560
and that meant that if I didn't build a strong platoon and a strong company,

1350
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:11.850
I would fall behind,

1351
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:17.030
and so I to tested the courage of the soldiers under me by using Chinese

1352
01:30:17.581 --> 01:30:18.414
prisoners.

1353
01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:24.060
This was normal training in the Japanese army.

1354
01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:29.570
When we were not involved in major operations,

1355
01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:37.140
we would go out into our own immediate area on continuous three day operations

1356
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:39.980
to see if there were any enemy around.

1357
01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:44.780
On such occasions we stole tortured and slaughtered people.

1358
01:30:46.450 --> 01:30:51.280
The Chinese had a saying about us that Japan had a threeway complete policy

1359
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:55.780
burned,
completely killed,
completely and pillaged completely.

1360
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:57.350
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1361
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:59.270
<v 0>Yet when we were doing those things,</v>

1362
01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:04.040
we had no sense of guilt or of doing anything wrong.

1363
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:07.580
It was for the emperor

1364
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:11.100
<v 2>for the country,</v>

1365
01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.940
<v 0>so that's how they're raised and that's how you get end up with someone like he,</v>

1366
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:27.760
she that goes through all that and still remains loyal even after defeat still

1367
01:31:27.761 --> 01:31:31.150
remains loyal to the deposed emperor

1368
01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:34.870
and here's an army doctor.

1369
01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:37.720
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1370
01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:42.580
<v 0>named Yuasa.
Ken,
this is not easy for me to speak about,</v>

1371
01:31:42.581 --> 01:31:44.710
but it is something I must confess

1372
01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:48.670
what I did was wrong.

1373
01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:54.610
It is also true that it was forced on me by the government,

1374
01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:57.850
but that does not reduce the size of my crime.

1375
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.350
It is something that happened a long time ago,

1376
01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:06.880
but those who are not taught about the war are ill educated.

1377
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:13.720
The Japanese armor army went to ponder and steel materials and to kill

1378
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:16.870
Japan wanted iron,

1379
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:21.880
coal and provisions and the army drove into the mountains to prosecute the war.

1380
01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:25.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1381
01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:26.071
<v 0>At the time,</v>

1382
01:32:26.071 --> 01:32:31.071
the Japanese used derogatory terms for the Chinese like Chinaman and Chink and

1383
01:32:32.431 --> 01:32:37.030
looked at them with contempt.
When I was a child,

1384
01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:40.960
we were told to despise the Chinese,
despise the Koreans.

1385
01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.330
It's all right to conquer them.

1386
01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.040
We have become elite and should join with the Americans and British and conquer

1387
01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:52.930
Asia.
I hated Warren killing,
but around middle school and into college,

1388
01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.990
I began to think that such ideas were unavoidable.

1389
01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:04.090
People were driven into a life which human qualities in which human qualities

1390
01:33:04.091 --> 01:33:04.924
were lost.

1391
01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1392
01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:10.780
<v 0>The soldiers outlet for frustrations was the brothel of the comfort women.</v>

1393
01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:16.770
Any means was resorted to in order to raise one's rank and keep up the authority

1394
01:33:17.111 --> 01:33:17.944
of the country.

1395
01:33:19.650 --> 01:33:20.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1396
01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:24.950
<v 0>And in the Army hospital,
we practiced vivisection</v>

1397
01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:31.760
living persons are good for the scalpel practice.
So people were brought in

1398
01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:37.610
one day soon after I started at the assignment,
the hospital had told us,

1399
01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.510
today we will have surgery practice.
I was startled.

1400
01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:45.690
It was an order.
There was no getting out of it.

1401
01:33:45.930 --> 01:33:50.930
Normally we dissected people who had died of such diseases as typhoid fever,

1402
01:33:51.090 --> 01:33:53.070
dysentery,
and tuberculosis.

1403
01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.990
Now we were being taken to the dissection room for a different type of exercise.

1404
01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.900
Soldiers came along as observers.

1405
01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:02.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1406
01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:07.690
<v 0>Everything started with a signal from the hospital had one Chinese had big fi's</v>

1407
01:34:07.691 --> 01:34:11.770
and walk slowly and calmly.
He laid down and had no sign of fear,

1408
01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:14.410
no stress on his face.
He was composed.

1409
01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.090
Someone else used him for surgery practice.

1410
01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:22.390
I went over and pushed the other one onto the operating table.

1411
01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:24.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1412
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.730
<v 0>I had no feeling of apology or of doing anything bad.</v>

1413
01:34:28.630 --> 01:34:29.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1414
01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:33.820
<v 0>The farmer was resigned to his fate and he lowered his head and walked forward.</v>

1415
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:40.500
I didn't want to get my clothes dirty from him.
I wanted to look sharp.

1416
01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.500
He went down as far as the operating table,
but didn't want to lie down.

1417
01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.760
A nurse using broken Chinese told him we're using ether.

1418
01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:54.770
It won't hurt.
So lie down.

1419
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:58.040
She gave me a wry smile

1420
01:34:58.820 --> 01:34:59.750
<v 2>when she said that</v>

1421
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.270
she had been working there for a long time and when I happened to meet her again

1422
01:35:05.271 --> 01:35:08.090
much later and asked her about it,
she didn't remember.

1423
01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:13.760
She was handling so many vivisections.
It was routine.

1424
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:19.080
<v 0>People who repeat evil acts do not remember them.</v>

1425
01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.030
There is no sense of wrongdoing.

1426
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:26.960
War means this.
Also,
war is not just shooting.

1427
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:30.680
In order for Japan to win,
all the Chinese were made prisoners.

1428
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.190
Women's bellies were cut.
Open homes were burned.

1429
01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:39.790
If you couldn't do this,
then you weren't a loyal soldier of the emperor.

1430
01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.560
Even if one despises an act,
one must bear it.

1431
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:51.860
From there,
a person becomes accustomed to it.

1432
01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:56.510
We all received practiced.
It was normal to smile at this.

1433
01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:59.840
The crimes committed during our aggressive wars are forgotten.

1434
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:04.990
Gone from memory at the time they were considered right.

1435
01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:14.890
So the surgery began.
The man was given ether and dissected.

1436
01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:19.270
His appendix was so small that it was like looking for a burrowing worm.

1437
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.970
I had to cut and search repeatedly.
The blood flow was stopped.

1438
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:29.890
Nerves were cut,
bones were cut with a saw and a tracheotomy was performed.

1439
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:34.930
Blood and air escape from his body.
The blood came foaming up.

1440
01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:36.850
Practice time was two hours.

1441
01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.370
The man died and his body was thrown into a hole and buried.

1442
01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.030
That was my first crime.

1443
01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:54.870
After that,
it was easy.

1444
01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:01.040
Eventually I dissected 14 Chinese.

1445
01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:08.940
I also saw vivisections.
Once I saw about 40 doctors gathered,

1446
01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.230
there was a man bound and squatting.
The guard asked the doctors,
are you ready?

1447
01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:14.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1448
01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:19.160
<v 0>And the prisoner was laid out without anesthetic to cuts were made down his</v>

1449
01:37:19.161 --> 01:37:21.770
belly.
The victim made a few gasps.

1450
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:25.160
The dissection was a botch and he died soon.

1451
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.850
I saw four people dissected that way.

1452
01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:32.783
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1453
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:34.380
<v 0>It is said that there are,</v>

1454
01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.980
that there were 20 million victims of the war in China,

1455
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:44.300
but only 10 to 20% of these were killed in gunfire exchange.

1456
01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:47.850
Most non resisting old people,

1457
01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:50.730
women and children were captured and slaughtered.

1458
01:37:53.310 --> 01:37:57.540
Prisoners of war could not taken to the front or allowed to escape,

1459
01:37:57.570 --> 01:38:00.660
so they were killed in the manner of the rape of Nan King.

1460
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:05.383
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1461
01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:09.510
<v 0>Those who were a part of it do not come forward to tell the people how it was.</v>

1462
01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:14.400
Why?
Because the Japanese had forgotten all about it.

1463
01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:20.160
Everybody's forgotten.

1464
01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:25.990
They did things and got metals and they don't think they did anything worse than

1465
01:38:25.991 --> 01:38:26.950
kicking a dog.

1466
01:38:30.010 --> 01:38:30.843
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1467
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:36.460
<v 0>They weren't bothered because they never considered it a dreadful thing to take</v>

1468
01:38:36.461 --> 01:38:39.880
a scalpel and cut open a living person.

1469
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:46.183
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1470
01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:51.540
<v 0>This'll be the last</v>

1471
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:54.840
piece of testimony that I read

1472
01:38:57.510 --> 01:39:02.490
and this was a soldier that was attached to unit seven 31

1473
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:06.890
named O'hara Tuckey Yoshi,

1474
01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.310
and he said I joined the cavalry

1475
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:18.850
from my home in 1939 in April of that year I was stationed in northeast China.

1476
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:23.900
Then in March,
1942 I was transferred to unit seven 31

1477
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:28.210
I did not know anything about that unit.

1478
01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:35.680
My first duty was taking care of domesticated animals such as sheep,

1479
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:38.300
goats,
horses,
and cows.

1480
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:44.690
I assisted in researching the diseases that affect these animals.

1481
01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:52.010
I saw tests in which Maru to were tied to crosses in a large circle.

1482
01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:58.240
As planes flew over and dropped bacteriological bombs in the area surrounded by

1483
01:40:00.101 --> 01:40:00.934
the crosses.

1484
01:40:02.690 --> 01:40:05.780
Their legs were chained and their bodies tied tightly.

1485
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:10.980
We observed the tests from a distance of about 200 meters.

1486
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.620
I had the job of cleaning up and disinfecting after the experiments and

1487
01:40:18.621 --> 01:40:20.480
gathering debris lying around.

1488
01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:28.640
I want people who come to this exhibition to tell their children and

1489
01:40:28.641 --> 01:40:33.110
grandchildren that there is nothing more stupid and fearful

1490
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:36.303
<v 2>than warm.</v>

1491
01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:47.520
<v 0>I want people to tell their children and grandchildren that there is nothing</v>

1492
01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.130
more stupid and more fearful than war.

1493
01:40:51.190 --> 01:40:55.600
Nothing more stupid and fearful than war.

1494
01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:05.510
And I think that's a good quote to end this except for it is wrong.

1495
01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:14.680
It is wrong because as stupid and as fearful and as reprehensible as war is,

1496
01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.990
there is something worse than war.

1497
01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:25.653
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1498
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:31.450
<v 0>And that is allowing this kind of evil to exist.</v>

1499
01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.413
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1500
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.250
<v 0>As bad as warriors and war is awful,
war is hell.</v>

1501
01:41:42.251 --> 01:41:47.251
And I have said that over and over again as have many others,

1502
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:51.340
but there are worst things than war.

1503
01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:53.350
Things like unit seven 31

1504
01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.630
<v 2>okay.</v>

1505
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:58.240
<v 0>Things like the Nazi concentration camps,</v>

1506
01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.850
things like the rape of Nan King.

1507
01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:08.340
There are things that are worse than war and there are times when war is not

1508
01:42:08.381 --> 01:42:12.730
only justified,
but it is a moral obligation.

1509
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:17.140
And I do not say that lightly.

1510
01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:21.913
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1511
01:42:22.150 --> 01:42:27.150
<v 0>But when evil and when darkness and when malevolent and demonic spirits rise to</v>

1512
01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:34.900
power,
they must be stopped.

1513
01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:39.133
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1514
01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:45.020
<v 0>And the responsibility for that lies within all of us everyday to do our best,</v>

1515
01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.970
to do our best,

1516
01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.360
to move the world away from the darkness and the demons that linger inside men's

1517
01:43:01.101 --> 01:43:02.180
minds.

1518
01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:12.180
A move the world toward the light

1519
01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:20.610
and toward what is good.

1520
01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:27.133
And

1521
01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:33.650
I think that is all I've got for tonight.
So

1522
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:36.380
Echo Charles,

1523
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:42.620
let me think while I decompress a little bit.

1524
01:43:43.610 --> 01:43:48.610
If you could talk about ways for the crew here to move towards the light.

1525
01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:52.070
I'm going to try.
I know,

1526
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.660
<v 3>I know.
And if you think about,</v>

1527
01:43:54.850 --> 01:43:55.480
<v 1>okay,</v>

1528
01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.350
<v 3>originally</v>

1529
01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:01.750
when we started getting into these kinds of podcasts that

1530
01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:08.810
touched upon some very heavy,
some very disturbing subject matter.

1531
01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:10.003
That was,

1532
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:14.870
that was where the whole sort of x,

1533
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:19.910
let's call it extended closing to the show began.

1534
01:44:20.290 --> 01:44:23.510
Yeah.
Kind of.
Yeah.
Good.
Just and,

1535
01:44:23.511 --> 01:44:28.220
and I remember like,
I remember like the first time I said to you like,

1536
01:44:28.221 --> 01:44:32.270
hey man,
you just talk for a little while.
Yeah.
I need a break over here.
Yeah.

1537
01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:35.450
That's how we ended up with this,
this thing.
Yeah.

1538
01:44:35.630 --> 01:44:38.570
But then the interesting thing people would say,
hey,

1539
01:44:38.571 --> 01:44:41.570
thanks for doing that because you're not the only one that needs to decompress

1540
01:44:41.571 --> 01:44:43.390
after you hear this freaking crap.
Yeah.

1541
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:46.550
Actually you hear about this just heinous,
evil.
Yeah.

1542
01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:51.830
That really happened.
Yeah.
We need a little break.

1543
01:44:51.831 --> 01:44:56.570
We need a little Echo Charles here
too,
you know?

1544
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:59.270
Yeah.
That's,
that's rough.
Where you,
you know,

1545
01:44:59.271 --> 01:45:02.330
you go from vivisection,

1546
01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:06.680
you know what if you were like,
hey,
all right,

1547
01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:11.410
that's all I got for tonight.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then you kind of are,

1548
01:45:11.411 --> 01:45:14.630
you turned off,
you go into,
I don't know,
work or whatever,

1549
01:45:14.690 --> 01:45:18.720
whenever you listened to it,
go to bed.
Oh no,
that's,
that came out with,
um,

1550
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:20.030
with one 21,

1551
01:45:20.031 --> 01:45:25.031
one 22 and one 23 with Louie polar and we'll chesty puller Louie polar and then

1552
01:45:25.551 --> 01:45:28.320
Jake Schick.
I wasn't going to do,

1553
01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:30.770
I said to myself,

1554
01:45:30.771 --> 01:45:35.771
I can't do one 21 and one 22 and just leave one 22 out there in the world by

1555
01:45:35.841 --> 01:45:37.250
itself.
I needed Jake Schick,

1556
01:45:37.251 --> 01:45:41.500
my brother to come on and like show that you can get through that,
you know?

1557
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:45.530
And so this is kind of the same thing,
you know,

1558
01:45:45.531 --> 01:45:50.010
I just can't like walk off.
Yeah,
yeah.
Mike drop and then,
yeah,

1559
01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:53.000
you guys deal with it.
No,
no.
We're going to deal with it together.

1560
01:45:53.001 --> 01:45:55.500
That's what we're going to have echo Charles to help us deal with it.

1561
01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:59.750
I'll come back little bit,
little bit,
little bit trite tiny camp.
Forget.
I mean,

1562
01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:02.360
it's,
you're not going to forget that,
you know,
anyway,
just like,

1563
01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:05.540
you can't forget miss shitty season.
You can't forget the repoting king,

1564
01:46:05.690 --> 01:46:09.440
I'll know thing.
So you're going to remember but can't forget them.
Eli masker.

1565
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:13.250
Yeah,
the harsh.
I mean just,
it's,
it's,
it's crazy.

1566
01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.070
Yeah.
But yeah,
man.

1567
01:46:16.250 --> 01:46:21.250
Oh far be it from our intention to leave you with bad feelings that last

1568
01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:30.110
we want,
I've said this before,
right?

1569
01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.260
We want you to remember but not dwell.
Yes.
Right.
I think that's important.

1570
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.060
You know,
are you dealing with loss?
I mean,

1571
01:46:38.061 --> 01:46:40.310
I talk about that a lot when you're dealing with loss.
Yeah.

1572
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:44.900
You always want to remember the people you've lost,
but you can't dwell on it.

1573
01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.940
Yeah.
And you always want to remember the rape and Nan,

1574
01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:52.230
you always want to remember machete season.
You always want,

1575
01:46:52.231 --> 01:46:55.140
want to remember unit seven 30 when you always want to remember man's search for

1576
01:46:55.141 --> 01:46:58.320
meaning.
You always want to remember me Lai massacre.

1577
01:46:58.321 --> 01:47:01.800
You want to remember those things because they're real and they happen and they

1578
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:06.450
can happen again if we let them.
Yeah.
We can't dwell on them because there's,

1579
01:47:06.451 --> 01:47:07.284
there's,

1580
01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:12.450
cause you know what we one good one and goodwill when,

1581
01:47:12.850 --> 01:47:15.450
yeah,
that's what I'm thinking.
Yeah.
Fully.

1582
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:20.750
You know how there's this movie called something about us in a Pete acumen 17

1583
01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:24.700
maybe.

1584
01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:29.590
There's literally no possible way I've seen this movie sending people.

1585
01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:33.320
I've never seen it.
I've seen the,
the,
the,
oh,

1586
01:47:33.370 --> 01:47:38.090
he's like completely like psycho sick,
disturbing.
Yeah.
Weirdo scientist guy.
So

1587
01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:43.530
you know,
I can't help but kind of think it's when you said this isn't a movie,

1588
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:44.820
this really happened.

1589
01:47:44.821 --> 01:47:47.490
And that's really the hard part when you really start to think about death.

1590
01:47:47.690 --> 01:47:50.890
Just like how we're sitting here right now,
what's easy things?

1591
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:54.480
What's really hard is you know,
you,

1592
01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:59.500
you picture the mother in a gas chamber with her baby and you,

1593
01:48:00.171 --> 01:48:04.620
you can't just picture up mother.
Yeah.
You can't just picture a child.

1594
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:08.760
You have to like picture a mother and a child that,
you know,

1595
01:48:09.150 --> 01:48:11.970
you need to put that in.
You need to picture someone that you,
cause you can't,

1596
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:12.571
you can't make,

1597
01:48:12.571 --> 01:48:16.470
that connection may be saying a mother and a child that that doesn't,

1598
01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:17.970
that doesn't bring it together for you.

1599
01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:23.120
You actually have to picture someone you know and their kid being that's what

1600
01:48:24.781 --> 01:48:27.360
you need to picture of being fourth.
Cause that's what those people were.

1601
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:30.570
They were people,
they were people would alive in there.

1602
01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:33.780
I had hopes and dreams and all those things and they got put into a gas chamber

1603
01:48:33.781 --> 01:48:36.300
to see how long they could last without a gas mask.

1604
01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:41.590
That's what you have to picture.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1605
01:48:42.690 --> 01:48:46.800
It makes the point for sure.
Well,
oh,
here's the moral question.

1606
01:48:48.650 --> 01:48:52.950
Okay.
You know how like some of these doctors and scientists,

1607
01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:57.330
they went on to be prosperous,
you know,
after this deal.

1608
01:48:58.380 --> 01:48:59.760
And they obviously,

1609
01:48:59.761 --> 01:49:03.390
I mean apparently some of them did some really good work where they're getting

1610
01:49:03.391 --> 01:49:06.570
like awards and whatnot.
And you know what,
speaking of this,

1611
01:49:06.571 --> 01:49:10.230
I was thinking about this because another really dark book that we covered on

1612
01:49:10.231 --> 01:49:14.130
here was an ordinary men in which ordinary men talked about the,
the police,

1613
01:49:14.170 --> 01:49:16.920
the Nazi police that went from being normal.

1614
01:49:16.921 --> 01:49:21.921
Guys that were middle aged hadn't been indoctrinated in the Nazi way of life as

1615
01:49:22.951 --> 01:49:23.431
children.

1616
01:49:23.431 --> 01:49:27.960
They got kind of like swept along with the rest of the Germans and they ended up

1617
01:49:28.050 --> 01:49:33.050
committing these heinous acts and murdering thousands and thousands of of Jews.

1618
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.050
But what's interesting about that,
so in that story,

1619
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.460
it's normal guys going evil in this story,

1620
01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.610
these evil guys that did evil things,

1621
01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:48.250
they come out the other side and kind of like go normal.
It's just

1622
01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:52.330
<v 4>so did they,
didn't they get kind of,
they got forced into it though,
right?</v>

1623
01:49:52.331 --> 01:49:55.600
Remember they were like,
Hey,
you got to do this or you die.

1624
01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.700
<v 3>Did get,
well,
not really.
If you remember in,
in ordinary men,</v>

1625
01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.830
their commander actually in the beginning is like,
hey,
if you want it,

1626
01:50:02.831 --> 01:50:03.940
if you don't want to do this,
go home.

1627
01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.980
<v 4>Right?
No,
no.
I mean the,
the Japanese or Japanese 31 remember?</v>

1628
01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.970
There's definitely some guys getting forced into it.
Yeah.
So you hear,

1629
01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:12.530
so here's the moral question.
It's like,
okay,
of course,
you know,

1630
01:50:12.531 --> 01:50:14.820
these guys committed crimes regardless of of,
you know,

1631
01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:16.700
the surrounding circumstances.

1632
01:50:16.701 --> 01:50:21.680
They committed these crimes with factual and then they kind of get away and then

1633
01:50:21.681 --> 01:50:26.090
they get into normal society and they're,
and they don't get punished.
Right.

1634
01:50:26.210 --> 01:50:29.690
Perceive like no justice,
no justice.

1635
01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:34.760
But so here's the moral questions.
So is it,

1636
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:39.790
did they make up even a little bit further crime by doing good in the future,

1637
01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:43.820
even though they didn't get punished?

1638
01:50:43.821 --> 01:50:48.590
Like did they make up for it or is it more of a crime because they got to do

1639
01:50:48.591 --> 01:50:49.430
good stuff.

1640
01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:54.460
They got to get awards and they got to be prosecutors in the prosperous yeah.

1641
01:50:54.471 --> 01:50:55.304
And they shouldn't have

1642
01:50:55.490 --> 01:51:00.260
<v 3>these are what if you look at it from the perspective of like,
Hey,</v>

1643
01:51:00.261 --> 01:51:01.970
let's look at them.
Hold.
So there's,

1644
01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:04.520
there's two ways I'm going to say I'm going to stages for you.

1645
01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:07.340
Look at it holistically from like,
okay,
here's this person.

1646
01:51:07.341 --> 01:51:10.910
Let's look at it from my,
from Jockos perspective.
Here's this person.

1647
01:51:10.911 --> 01:51:11.930
They did these horrible things,

1648
01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:16.160
but now they've kind of got back on track and they've put their life together

1649
01:51:16.161 --> 01:51:19.190
and,
and that's,
that's a positive thing.
And they've,

1650
01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.530
even if you can't make up for that whole crime,

1651
01:51:21.531 --> 01:51:25.130
at least you're chipping away at some of the horrible things you did and

1652
01:51:25.131 --> 01:51:27.380
replacing it with something good.
And,

1653
01:51:27.381 --> 01:51:30.230
and you can see where people come to the conclusion that like,
well,
okay,

1654
01:51:30.231 --> 01:51:34.190
I can kind of see how that makes sense.
Yeah,
that's one way of looking at it.

1655
01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:37.730
<v 4>There's two,
by the way,
not just in this is,
I mean it's easy to be like,
hey,</v>

1656
01:51:37.731 --> 01:51:38.840
he got to do all this stuff,

1657
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:42.350
but if they're doing good work scientifically and for,
you know,

1658
01:51:42.351 --> 01:51:46.460
medical schools and stuff like this is obviously they're teaching people,

1659
01:51:46.610 --> 01:51:49.670
they're probably,
you know,
making breakthroughs in,
in,
you know,

1660
01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:52.970
discoveries in the field and stuff that's going to help people in general,

1661
01:51:52.971 --> 01:51:53.290
you know.

1662
01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:58.290
<v 3>Now here's the other way I'm going to frame it for you is from the eyes of that</v>

1663
01:51:58.961 --> 01:52:01.330
mother who's in that gas chamber,

1664
01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:05.650
who's watching that switch gets turned and she knows it's going to kill her and

1665
01:52:05.651 --> 01:52:10.360
her child.
And there's no,
there's no redemption is zero.

1666
01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:11.973
<v 2>Nope.</v>

1667
01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:18.570
<v 3>Check.
Good job.
Try to lighten up the mood over here.
[inaudible].</v>

1668
01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:22.380
Hey man,
you know.
All right.
Well Hey,

1669
01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:26.880
let's talk some porch some so we could support dwelling.

1670
01:52:26.881 --> 01:52:30.640
We're dwelling in our,
we're breaking,
breaking our,
our own code here.
Okay.

1671
01:52:30.690 --> 01:52:34.170
We're dwelling it code.
Yes.
All right,
well let's

1672
01:52:34.230 --> 01:52:34.920
<v 4>talk about origin.</v>

1673
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.240
I feel like we should talk about origin and the first thing about origin that I

1674
01:52:39.241 --> 01:52:42.810
will talk about is the geese,
the flagship

1675
01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:46.070
<v 3>product ease all in America by the way,</v>

1676
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:47.300
<v 4>a rash guards as well.</v>

1677
01:52:47.301 --> 01:52:52.301
This is you just too by the way specifically but not limited to so while the

1678
01:52:52.491 --> 01:52:54.170
Geezer kind of limited to,

1679
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:58.220
unless you want to make a dragon weaves to suit like you're the one who

1680
01:52:58.221 --> 01:53:01.670
recommended you because you can do judo in that in a,
yeah,

1681
01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:05.510
I guess technically you could do karate too if you want.
Technically.

1682
01:53:05.511 --> 01:53:08.660
I mean but they're made for Jujitsu.
The rash guards made for Jujitsu,

1683
01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:13.970
but you can use it for like cycling and body boarding and what not.
Yeah.

1684
01:53:14.150 --> 01:53:18.470
Anything that you want to protect yourself from.
Rashes,

1685
01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:22.520
not epic,
not germ rashes like rash rashes.

1686
01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:26.090
Actually it does have a anti microbial stuff in it is true.

1687
01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.160
It is kind of protected from it anyway,

1688
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:33.550
or demean.com that's where you can get this stuff all made in America and also

1689
01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:36.523
joggers

1690
01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:41.350
coming from the connoisseur have of comfort himself.
That's me.

1691
01:53:41.670 --> 01:53:45.620
Self comment about that.
Yes.
The you're,
you're now becoming known.
Yeah.

1692
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:49.610
Maybe you could parlay that into like a whole thing.
Yeah,
like a whole thing.

1693
01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:52.630
Yeah.
Just have your own thing going on.

1694
01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:57.080
Not Wasting things for all.
Establish a standard of comfort.

1695
01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:00.410
It will be called the concert of comfort scale.
You see what I'm saying?

1696
01:54:00.650 --> 01:54:05.160
You know how like in temperature there's like Kelvin Celsius Fahrenheit.
Yup.

1697
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:09.110
I'll beat that for company Echo scale,
Echo,
scale of comfort,

1698
01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:12.470
what would the highest level of comfort be?
Would it just be one to 10 you know,

1699
01:54:12.471 --> 01:54:15.570
it'd be,
uh,
well,

1700
01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:20.650
Jay would be the highest ranking Oj origin joggers.

1701
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:24.710
Oh Damn.
I'm over here.

1702
01:54:24.711 --> 01:54:28.760
I'm like Pete,
for some reason he's a kind guy.
I like to just call,

1703
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:33.620
you know how you like you'll text someone,
hey,
I want to,
you don't really,

1704
01:54:33.621 --> 01:54:36.540
but nowadays we like to text people.
You don't live it.

1705
01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.930
I'm not going to bother them.
I'm not going to,
you know,
but I don't know.

1706
01:54:38.931 --> 01:54:42.890
For some reason I like to call Pete,
so call them and I'll be like,
hey,

1707
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:47.630
when's the shorts coming out?
Not First of all,
we can,
you know,

1708
01:54:48.090 --> 01:54:50.930
cause I want to wear them,
you know,
that kind of stuff.
Anyway,

1709
01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:52.580
so I'm about to call him and be like,
hey,

1710
01:54:52.581 --> 01:54:55.580
we need more colors of joggers or whatever.
But here's the thing,
Dewey,

1711
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:59.960
I need more colors so I can't just be running Pete around his factory,

1712
01:54:59.961 --> 01:55:04.310
making new colors.
Just for me personally or maybe you can't.
I Dunno.

1713
01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:06.420
But it would help.
But yeah,
they're,

1714
01:55:06.450 --> 01:55:10.220
they're real good joggers and tee shirts and hoodies and whatnot.
Good stuff,

1715
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:13.160
mate.
Origin made in America,
made in America,

1716
01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:17.060
which is good on a whole bunch of different levels.
Also,

1717
01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:20.840
we've got a bunch of supplements.
We got joint warfare,

1718
01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:24.800
we got Krill oil,
we got discipline,

1719
01:55:24.801 --> 01:55:29.690
which is good to drink before you get after it.

1720
01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:31.700
Mentally or physically.

1721
01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:35.990
And also we got milk.
Yeah.

1722
01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.380
But back to joint warfare.
Okay.
So let me get it.

1723
01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:43.860
I know you're wondering how my arm is doing.
I know,
I know.
Right.

1724
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:49.050
I'll let you know.
So I went to Oregon,
the Oregon coast last week.

1725
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:54.150
One week,
forgot the joint warfare.
Oh,
I just had surgery on my bicep.
About six.

1726
01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:57.460
Yeah,
six weeks ago.
And you know,

1727
01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:03.060
I would have FedEx you some bro.
I know.
Uh Yeah.
And thank you.
But you know,
I did.

1728
01:56:03.061 --> 01:56:05.690
How long did it take before you notice it?
Um,
I'm,

1729
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:08.540
I'm guessing the moral of the story is this didn't work out good.
So,

1730
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:10.950
and here's the thing.
My surgeon is good.
He was good.

1731
01:56:10.951 --> 01:56:14.940
He did a good job on my Arab,
reattached my bicep tendon to my bone,

1732
01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:19.080
drill the hole in the bone.
Boom.
Stick it through so it up cause she gets,

1733
01:56:19.081 --> 01:56:24.030
she gets Yalta.
Right.
Um,
so I take joint warfare and the thing feels good.

1734
01:56:24.031 --> 01:56:25.680
Like I'm way ahead of schedule,
you know,

1735
01:56:25.681 --> 01:56:28.560
surprisingly because I had it done in my alarm nine years ago,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1736
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:31.530
So it's all good.
I'm moving around,

1737
01:56:31.531 --> 01:56:34.420
I'm doing like push ups doing stuff that no way I could get,

1738
01:56:34.450 --> 01:56:37.560
I could have done with,
with my other arm last time.
So I got to the Oregon coast,

1739
01:56:37.561 --> 01:56:38.700
forget that joint warfare.

1740
01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:42.360
I attribute it to the joint more for how far I had I am.
So I forget that.

1741
01:56:42.361 --> 01:56:45.540
Joint Warfare.
I'm in the Oregon coast,
I would say about two days.

1742
01:56:45.690 --> 01:56:49.860
And here's the thing in start like hurting or going backwards,
nothing like that.

1743
01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:53.430
But he was just this weird stiffness that sorta disagree.

1744
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:56.640
Like I couldn't straighten it out right away and when I wake up,
you know,

1745
01:56:56.641 --> 01:56:57.474
I can't like,
you know,

1746
01:56:57.530 --> 01:57:01.920
I kind of got to work it out and it slowly just started to stiffen up a little

1747
01:57:01.921 --> 01:57:05.400
more.
And here's the thing,
I was way less active on it to where,

1748
01:57:05.610 --> 01:57:09.400
because when I do like pushups and stuff where I'm using my elbow a lot,
um,

1749
01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:11.310
it'd be kind of stiff that night,
you know.

1750
01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.590
Then the next day he loosened up and then it stronger.
You know,

1751
01:57:13.591 --> 01:57:17.910
it's just one of the things like muscles.
But,
um,
so I wasn't doing that.

1752
01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:22.260
Not much activity and it was just general stiffness.

1753
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:27.690
Yeah.
Brah I was like,
I don't want to say it felt inflamed,
but it felt like,

1754
01:57:27.691 --> 01:57:28.524
you know,

1755
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:32.430
you know how like you sprain your thumb or something like that and it's like

1756
01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:37.410
swollen and it's like just jammed up.
He can use it.
But anyway,

1757
01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:40.730
it kind of felt like that functional but not optimal functional,
whatnot,

1758
01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.600
not option optimal.

1759
01:57:42.810 --> 01:57:47.520
And then I come back two days back on the joint warfare boom,
back in the game,

1760
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:49.700
full on back in the game.
That's pretty cool.

1761
01:57:49.710 --> 01:57:54.300
In the rear for hell of a thing then.
Good close to me.

1762
01:57:54.330 --> 01:57:57.720
Could Drayton,
curcumin good for your brain too,
by the way?
Just like discipline.

1763
01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:03.820
Also milk as you were saying with methe,
first of all,

1764
01:58:03.821 --> 01:58:08.040
most awesome.
Second of all,
what is milk?
It's milk.
Everyone knows that now.

1765
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:11.350
I think that's pretty much going to be the new thing.
Um,

1766
01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:16.050
and we have peanut butter.
Chocolate will be coming out.
Oh,

1767
01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:19.780
I want to say,
I want to say within a week you're all like,
yeah,

1768
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:21.720
we have his rudder.
And Chuck,

1769
01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:26.790
we have peanut butter and chocolate coming in about a week maybe?

1770
01:58:27.090 --> 01:58:28.140
No,
no,
no.
It's not even a,

1771
01:58:28.141 --> 01:58:31.290
maybe it's a straight up one week counting down the days.
Okay,
that's good.

1772
01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:34.600
So milk,
protein,
how many,
how much or how many grams of protein in milk?

1773
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:39.690
22 first group.
So,
and I heard this,
I recently,
actually,

1774
01:58:39.691 --> 01:58:42.220
I didn't read it.
I saw it on a video youtube video.

1775
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:46.360
<v 3>I know that sounds liquor or youtube video button.
This one had credibility.
So</v>

1776
01:58:48.690 --> 01:58:51.490
I,
you know,
Eh,
so you need,
not need,

1777
01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:54.930
but a good amount of protein is one gram.

1778
01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:58.390
They thought it was like 1.5 we were trying to build muscle and all this stuff.

1779
01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:02.560
But it's changed.
It's about,
yeah.
According to this,

1780
01:59:02.590 --> 01:59:07.210
it's like 0.7 or something like this.
I don't know.

1781
01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:10.120
I need more than that.
And we're gonna tell you right now.
All right,

1782
01:59:10.121 --> 01:59:13.990
well there you go.
Mark.
Get it.
And it tastes good.
Real good by the way.

1783
01:59:14.050 --> 01:59:17.770
It's dessert.
Yeah.
Any was more classified as a dessert.

1784
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:22.520
That's the question to me currently.
It's currently,
it would have to be proven.

1785
01:59:23.170 --> 01:59:26.230
I literally eat my dinner and then I'm all excited to have more.

1786
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:33.100
It is a dessert and I went on a trip and I haven't figured out how to travel

1787
01:59:33.101 --> 01:59:36.400
with milk yet,
which is a real bummer.
But you know,
it's a scoop.

1788
01:59:36.401 --> 01:59:39.700
You can't bring six scoops and I'm real light traveler.

1789
01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:44.770
And so now when I go somewhere and I get whatever,
I'll get a good meal,

1790
01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:48.690
I'll get a legit meal,
but I want to dessert.
Yeah,
I want milk.

1791
01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:53.410
You put it in a Ziploc bag puff.

1792
01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:57.580
Not In your carry on.
By the way,
then you've got gotta bring a Shaker.

1793
01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:02.130
Right.
There's this multiple problems that I have.
I've got to figure it out.

1794
02:00:02.131 --> 02:00:05.860
I'll figure it out a to figure it out.
One thing I can say is too is when I,

1795
02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:07.240
when I,
I've always,

1796
02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:12.360
if I drink protein shakes in the past I would have to use a big shaker

1797
02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:18.370
and brought a lot,
put price,
16 ounces of milk.

1798
02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:22.150
One thing that's good about mark and cause that's the only way that you feel

1799
02:00:22.151 --> 02:00:25.510
satisfied with Mulkey.
You can use one of the small little shakers.

1800
02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:27.900
So this is a possibility.
See,
I'm creating ideas right now.
Sure.

1801
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:29.200
I can be one of the small shakers,

1802
02:00:29.201 --> 02:00:32.110
bring a little bit of milk in it and then just hit it up and we'll be good

1803
02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:34.930
because you don't need a big giant Shaker cause you don't need to drink that

1804
02:00:34.931 --> 02:00:38.970
much milk to feel like,
like you got enough dessert.

1805
02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:46.760
Anyway,
back to the deal.
Uh,
emerging camp.
Yep.

1806
02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:51.730
Winter jackets coming August 26 26 through September 2nd.
This is weird,

1807
02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:52.870
but we might,

1808
02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:57.670
it looks like we might actually sell out at a certain point.

1809
02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.880
How do you sell out of the cat?
I didn't think we'd be,

1810
02:01:00.490 --> 02:01:03.300
so if you want to come get registered because it,

1811
02:01:03.301 --> 02:01:06.550
we're probably going to end up because you can look,
we,
we have,

1812
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:11.670
we already bought more mats,
double the Mat,
so we had to muster.
Yeah.

1813
02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:16.120
It's a lot of maths but still,
I mean there's still a limit.

1814
02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:21.040
So if you want to come to that,
come,
uh,
I'll be there.
Echobee there.

1815
02:01:21.041 --> 02:01:24.610
Dave Burke will be their life Leif and we'll be there.
Jps on the fence.

1816
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:30.310
Dean lister,
Dean List will be there.
Sure.

1817
02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:34.910
Yeah.
And that's good.
Where you know,
when you learn stuff at the,

1818
02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:36.460
I mean there's there,
you know there's there,

1819
02:01:36.670 --> 02:01:39.890
you're going to learn specific things from specific people and all that stuff,

1820
02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:40.753
but

1821
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:45.650
<v 4>don't look at it like this thing where you're gonna go and you're just going to</v>

1822
02:01:45.651 --> 02:01:47.600
learn what they have to teach you.
You know,

1823
02:01:47.630 --> 02:01:52.630
they're going to teach you spider guard 15 or 20 black belts there.

1824
02:01:52.730 --> 02:01:56.390
Yes.
So on top of that,
if you made it your goal,

1825
02:01:56.391 --> 02:01:59.930
if you went and you went and you said went to each one of those 15 black belts

1826
02:01:59.931 --> 02:02:03.160
and said,
show me your move your best move.
Yeah.

1827
02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:06.320
If you did that and he walked away,
that would be,

1828
02:02:07.410 --> 02:02:11.540
that would be solid.
But you,
you couldn't,
this is not,
this isn't a,
Hey,

1829
02:02:11.541 --> 02:02:14.240
show me your move and you spend three minutes.
No,
I'm talking.
If you,

1830
02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:19.160
if you spent like an hour,
maybe even an hour and a half going over,

1831
02:02:19.210 --> 02:02:20.600
what's your best move?

1832
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:25.900
Like I bet I could teach certain moves for an hour and a half.

1833
02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:30.140
Yeah.
And just show every little detail.

1834
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:32.510
If you came to the immersion camp and that's what you did,

1835
02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:34.640
you'd be rocking out of their [inaudible].

1836
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:38.810
It'd be rough if everyone did that because you know it'd be hard.

1837
02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.180
I don't think you could,
I don't think you could logistically do it.

1838
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:42.560
But I will say this,

1839
02:02:42.561 --> 02:02:47.050
that on top of what all the instructors there and not dimension,

1840
02:02:47.210 --> 02:02:51.410
just other experienced people,
what they have to offer and teach you.

1841
02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:53.850
You can come and be like,

1842
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:58.250
my rear naked choke needs work.

1843
02:02:58.730 --> 02:03:01.790
This is how I do it.
Eight Jocko,
come here.
This is a tall,
I do it.

1844
02:03:02.630 --> 02:03:04.640
This is all day by the way,
you,
you have this opportunity.

1845
02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:06.820
This is how I do it and show.
Well that's,

1846
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:11.630
that's one thing that you could do because you can't just literally train the

1847
02:03:11.631 --> 02:03:15.710
entire time,
but you can get shown moves and you can work moves oil.

1848
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:18.230
You can't just train cause you'll die.

1849
02:03:20.050 --> 02:03:21.960
You'll die for sure.
But if,

1850
02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:26.380
but the point is there though where you can come and you can come to immersion

1851
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:28.470
camp.
Right.
And it's good again,
to learn from,

1852
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:30.320
from everything that everyone has to teach.

1853
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:35.420
But you can go in with specific questions up with your game where are used to

1854
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:36.950
like,
oh,
for sure,
how am I going to get better?

1855
02:03:36.951 --> 02:03:39.980
Of course my Jesus is going to get better in general.
That's good.
Of course.

1856
02:03:40.190 --> 02:03:43.150
But if it's like,
wait,
well,
my mount,
if you,

1857
02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.350
if you get more of your mount escapes get better,

1858
02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.840
then that's what you focused on.
And you could ask actually,

1859
02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:49.460
while I'll give you this advice,

1860
02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:52.700
if you have trouble being mounted it and escaping them out,

1861
02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:57.560
a good person to ask about that is actually Echo Charles.
You have a very good,

1862
02:03:57.650 --> 02:03:59.800
uh,
mountain scape.
Well,
yes,
very teachable.

1863
02:03:59.910 --> 02:04:03.890
That's one of your best moves is the amount of escape.
I will say that right now,

1864
02:04:04.190 --> 02:04:07.640
authoritatively brought all got a good amount of scape.
Thanks Bro.

1865
02:04:08.210 --> 02:04:11.540
Also shifting gears,
so yeah.
Anyway,
but yeah.
Immersion camp,

1866
02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:16.570
August 26th to September 2nd origin main.com for all that crap that we just

1867
02:04:16.881 --> 02:04:21.010

1868
02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.620

It's not Jocko gear doesn't really have your face on it or nothing.

02:05:11.890 --> 02:05:16.020
<v 4>Flex.
Say I like hats.
I don't wear a hat.
Yeah,</v>

1884
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:19.680
my head got to get a Tan,
but actually I did.

1885
02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:21.720
I went in phases not to go to do.

1886
02:05:21.721 --> 02:05:25.770
You said you were going to get me much more of these truckers hats and you did

1887
02:05:25.771 --> 02:05:30.420
not.
Which one does,

They're being embroidered right now.
Okay.

1889
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:37.080
Actually I added like a bonus color of the,

1890
02:05:37.170 --> 02:05:41.820
I don't support bonus colors.
A bonus.
No,
but it's like a khaki,
uh,

1891
02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:45.590
like uh,
like a brown,
like a 10 Roscoe and tactically

1892
02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:50.520
pay.
Anyway,
Jaclyn zeroed out,
calm.
A lot of good stuff.

1893
02:05:50.521 --> 02:05:52.930
Do you just stuff on their women's stuff on there?
Oh,

1894
02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:56.040
I have to meet these whatnot.
Some posters on there too.
By the way,

1895
02:05:56.430 --> 02:06:00.240
you didn't even know about that today because a lot of people,

1896
02:06:00.241 --> 02:06:02.990
and I mean for real,
a lot of people like a lot,
a lot like seven.

1897
02:06:04.710 --> 02:06:08.880
One of the posters of a discipline equals freedom and the good poster,

1898
02:06:08.881 --> 02:06:12.690
those are the ones that people would hit me up often.
Very often be like,
Hey,

1899
02:06:12.691 --> 02:06:15.810
my gym,
I want to poster.
I want a poster from my room I want to post for,

1900
02:06:15.811 --> 02:06:19.620
from my office,
you know,
24 by 36 posters.
It's two posters on there.

1901
02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:23.010
I'll make other,
other ones.
But yeah,
that's some post show back a boom.

1902
02:06:23.011 --> 02:06:26.370
Represent in your gym and your office and your home.
I got one in my home.

1903
02:06:26.371 --> 02:06:28.830
First thing when you walk in,
it's interesting.

1904
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:33.090
A poster of our podcasts did good poster.
That's cool.
Yeah,

1905
02:06:33.091 --> 02:06:36.660
so your face is kind of sorted there,
you know,
representing in my house.

1906
02:06:36.661 --> 02:06:37.800
Thanks Junkie.
By the way.

1907
02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:42.660
Also good way to support the podcast is to subscribe to the podcast on iTunes

1908
02:06:42.661 --> 02:06:46.560
and Google play,
stitcher,
wherever you listen to,
to podcasts.

1909
02:06:47.630 --> 02:06:51.140
<v 3>Interesting how there's so many of them out there now.
There's a lot of podcasts.</v>

1910
02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:53.630
No platform,
sorry.
Yeah,
the platform.

1911
02:06:54.010 --> 02:06:56.210
A lot of podcasts and there's a lot of podcast platforms,
but yes,

1912
02:06:56.211 --> 02:07:00.640
it's the new media,
the new media,
new media for bullies is they say,
yeah,
it,

1913
02:07:00.641 --> 02:07:05.210
his voice,
his voice.
Uh,
also in addition to this podcast,

1914
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:09.740
which is called the Jocko podcast,
there's also the warrior kid podcast,

1915
02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:14.720
which is for kids.

1916
02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:17.900
But I promise you can get a lot out of it as an adult too.

1917
02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:21.650
Cool thing I've been doing on that.
I've done it twice.
I'm going to do it more,

1918
02:07:21.651 --> 02:07:22.484
but,

1919
02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:26.810
so it's questions for uncle Jake is the basic premises premise of it.

1920
02:07:27.170 --> 02:07:31.430
But now I have stories from Uncle Jake and the stories from Uncle Jake are

1921
02:07:31.431 --> 02:07:36.431
actually from uncle Jake's childhood and they kind of a lesson to people.

1922
02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:38.800
Yeah.

1923
02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:43.390
So that's number podcast number 14 and 15 are the first two that I've started

1924
02:07:43.391 --> 02:07:47.980
doing stories from Uncle Jake.
So I think people will like those.

1925
02:07:48.230 --> 02:07:51.520
Yeah,
yeah,
they're good.

1926
02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:57.100
So this kind of like character development sprinkled in there with the lesson to

1927
02:07:58.781 --> 02:08:01.300
me,
the less than one,
and I'm um,
maybe this is intentional,

1928
02:08:01.301 --> 02:08:05.290
but the lesson is the primary thing course and it's deep.
It's deep thing.

1929
02:08:05.291 --> 02:08:08.650
They're very,
uh,
consistent with the whole uncle Jake.

1930
02:08:08.970 --> 02:08:13.970
Way Simple lesson of the idea is I'm explaining how uncle Jake got his values

1931
02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:21.150
yeah.
From experiences that he went through as a child.
Yeah.

1932
02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:25.670
And their,
the stories are five minutes,
eight minutes,
something like that.
Yeah.

1933
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:27.520
They're,
they're,
they're pretty short stories,

1934
02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:32.320
but they're cool and they're enjoyable.
So warrior kid podcast,

1935
02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:37.120
you can check that one out.
It's,
it's good.
And if kids,

1936

We do have a youtube channel.

1939
02:08:50.561 --> 02:08:53.530
If you're interested in the video version of this podcast,

1940
02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:56.680
if you want to see echoes editing skills.
Sure.

1941
02:08:57.130 --> 02:09:01.280
Some people say you went over the top.
Sure.
I'll go over the top from you.

1942
02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:03.260
There's a video called warpath.
It's,

1943
02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:06.970
it's probably the most controversial video from my perspective because it was

1944
02:09:06.971 --> 02:09:08.470
originally made with Christmas music,

1945
02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:12.850
which I don't like Christmas music and acclimated with Christmas music and he

1946
02:09:12.851 --> 02:09:14.110
put a lot of time and effort into it.

1947
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:18.280
Christmas if we want to talk leadership here,
like from my perspective,

1948
02:09:18.281 --> 02:09:21.310
I knew you'd been working really hard on this thing and then you showed it to me

1949
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:25.330
and the Christmas music kicked in,
which I didn't like,
didn't match,

1950
02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:28.930
but you know,
I just had to be like,
hey man,
it's great.
I really appreciate it.

1951
02:09:28.931 --> 02:09:31.510
You all,
that's a great video.
So I lied to you.
Is that a lie?

1952
02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:36.310
You didn't say great.
No,
you did not lie.
Okay.

1953
02:09:36.370 --> 02:09:37.060
You said,

1954
02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:42.010
and I quote interesting choice music for this one.

1955
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:43.130
That's now.

1956
02:09:43.330 --> 02:09:47.440
I also will say that I don't a hundred percent trust myself.

1957
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:51.130
Like I think to myself,
well echo really liked Christmas music,

1958
02:09:51.131 --> 02:09:53.740
so he put it in there,
so that's fine if that,

1959
02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:55.960
maybe some other people will like it too.
And that's,

1960
02:09:55.961 --> 02:09:58.450
I'm not here to like dictate what people like and don't like.

1961
02:09:58.451 --> 02:10:02.650
I'm just here to tell you what I like and don't like.
But then you,

1962
02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:07.220
but then you read it the video with with more appropriate music.
Sure.

1963
02:10:07.450 --> 02:10:09.120
Which is good,
but,

1964
02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:13.980
but then some people said you got crazy,
you went too far with,

1965
02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:16.540
you went through for you.
Too much stuff exploded.

1966
02:10:16.541 --> 02:10:19.530
You've got too much stuff going on.
There's the same amount of explosion.

1967
02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:20.860
I know what I'm saying.

1968
02:10:20.861 --> 02:10:23.500
I never really paid too much attention to what people say because I couldn't

1969
02:10:23.501 --> 02:10:27.250
even get past the music once I got past the music and I check the youtube

1970
02:10:27.251 --> 02:10:31.990
comments,
which I know,
right.
Yeah.
You know,
I went there and people,

1971
02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:34.130
some people,
the

1972
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:38.930
<v 4>majority of people,
yeah.
Said amazing.
Right,
the mature.</v>

1973
02:10:39.110 --> 02:10:42.980
Some people just threw it out there.
Hey,
take it easy bro.

1974
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:47.700
You can't,
you crossed the line,
right?
If you went over lunch,

1975
02:10:48.660 --> 02:10:52.820
I think you were around the line.
Yeah.
I think you might've,

1976
02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:56.240
you know,
stepped the tone a little bit,

1977
02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:00.230
but we have to find out where the line is.
Right?
Yes.

1978
02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:03.180
And I think you did a good job of pressing up against mine without just getting

1979
02:11:03.181 --> 02:11:05.850
into,
well let me,
uh,
let me tell you the philosophy into,

1980
02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:10.490
and tell me if this is a good way to approach it.
Put so a lot of those videos.

1981
02:11:10.670 --> 02:11:15.240
Okay,
so consider the first one we did good,
right?
It's the first one.

1982
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.650
Okay.
Good job.
Out of the gate.

1983
02:11:17.690 --> 02:11:22.690
I think I might've told the story like there's a story behind,

1984
02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:25.670
but we're recording podcast.
He was like number three or five,

1985
02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:28.910
one of the first initial ones.
And I was like,
oh,

1986
02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:32.720
my camera was sitting over there behind,
kind of behind,
over in the corner.

1987
02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:36.200
And if you notice on good when it shows you,

1988
02:11:36.201 --> 02:11:40.100
you can see like it's behind like a monitor and see.
You can see this style.

1989
02:11:40.110 --> 02:11:41.540
I just went and pressed,

1990
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:45.140
I kind of moved the camera a little bit and I just press record before you said

1991
02:11:45.141 --> 02:11:47.420
that,
that part.
And I was like,
Oh,

1992
02:11:47.421 --> 02:11:49.550
I'm going to record this just in case I'll make,
I'll make a video,

1993
02:11:49.551 --> 02:11:51.380
a lot of it or something,
or like,
okay,
whatever.

1994
02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.520
And if you look at it and watch it the other day,
we're like,

1995
02:11:55.521 --> 02:11:58.250
Joe Rogan guys were talking about it.
And so I was like,
Oh,
let me watch it.

1996
02:11:58.280 --> 02:11:59.630
You know?
And I remember thinking,

1997
02:11:59.810 --> 02:12:02.210
and you're like reading and when you're looking up,

1998
02:12:02.211 --> 02:12:07.211
like you're looking at me and I remember you saying this stuff to me and I'm

1999
02:12:08.691 --> 02:12:11.450
like,
fuck,
this is crazy.
This girl,
I'm glad I'm recording it.

2000
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:15.080
But that wasn't made.
It wasn't like,
okay,
we're going to do this,

2001
02:12:15.081 --> 02:12:17.270
we're going to record this and we're going to do that.
You know?
It was just like,

2002
02:12:17.271 --> 02:12:19.250
oh,
I'm going to try to make a fun video out of it,

2003
02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:24.340
and then just put some random like graphics on there that it was just having fun

2004
02:12:24.531 --> 02:12:28.410
doing.
So these videos you do it,
they're kind of done out of just fun,
you know,

2005
02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:32.480
and,
and every once in a while,
hey man,
you have too much fun,

2006
02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:37.010
you grab some sound effects and you make the walls crumble,
you do kind of stuff.

2007
02:12:37.011 --> 02:12:39.020
You know,
you have some fun with it.
I mean there's no,

2008
02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.640
I guess there is kind of their thematic I guess.
Right?
There's some theme to it.

2009
02:12:43.670 --> 02:12:48.000
Like warpath it's kind of,
for me it's like it's,

2010
02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:51.320
it's pretty awesome to watch.
I could see where you're like,

2011
02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:55.340
I can see where you start going down the path of like just more is better.

2012
02:12:57.150 --> 02:12:57.983
Yeah.

2013
02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:02.660
And that's really what happens and I'll catch myself doing it and it'll take a

2014
02:13:02.661 --> 02:13:05.930
long ass.
I,
I'm like Bro,
this is not even necessary.
And in fact,

2015
02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:08.240
in some people they will bring up this point,

2016
02:13:08.241 --> 02:13:11.360
which is a good point where I put stuff combine right for,
okay,

2017
02:13:11.361 --> 02:13:12.980
poor power to take warpath for example,

2018
02:13:13.190 --> 02:13:17.120
I put the walls crumbling and Jacqueline Dean Rolling.
And when they,

2019
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.300
when they clash,
like the walls come chattering down,

2020
02:13:20.301 --> 02:13:23.090
it's all these special effects,
which is like cool when you look at it.

2021
02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:27.050
But all the special effects,
the sound effects and like all this stuff,
it's like,

2022
02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:30.080
is it kind of getting in the way of the message?

2023
02:13:30.081 --> 02:13:32.520
Because the message is like you're saying something specific,
you know,

2024
02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:36.790
so it's kind of getting in the way,
you know?
So I got to watch out for that.
Yeah.

2025
02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:39.840
And I think that's a good point.
When people say that,
I'm like,
Dang,
that's true.

2026
02:13:40.070 --> 02:13:44.370
And because you don't know when you're in the Mitchell or stoked.
Yeah,

2027
02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:46.780
I guess.
But I,
yeah,
I've got to watch him.
You're right.

2028
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:50.780
<v 3>Uh,
a,
there's also a warrior kid youtube channel.
Okay.</v>

2029
02:13:50.781 --> 02:13:55.781
So the reason that we separated the warrior kid and the warrior kid and the

2030
02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:58.700
Jocko podcast,
channel channel,
blah,
blah,
blah,

2031
02:13:59.090 --> 02:14:04.090
is because we know that there's things on this podcast and on the therefore on

2032
02:14:04.191 --> 02:14:05.800
the youtube channel Jocko podcast,

2033
02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:09.200
there's stuff that's inappropriate for children to listen to or watch.

2034
02:14:09.710 --> 02:14:12.260
And so this is a way to separate them.

2035
02:14:12.261 --> 02:14:16.190
So there's also a warrior kid youtube channel that your kid can sit there and

2036
02:14:16.191 --> 02:14:20.900
watch and hopefully I'm not guaranteeing because I don't know how the algorithms

2037
02:14:20.901 --> 02:14:23.150
work that pop up the next video selections,

2038
02:14:23.570 --> 02:14:28.490
but hopefully your kid can watch the warrior kid videos without getting hooked

2039
02:14:28.491 --> 02:14:32.210
into the unit.
Seven 31 customer about pivot section.

2040
02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:35.960
So watch out for that.
Yup,
true story.

2041
02:14:36.810 --> 02:14:38.570
And that one's in color too by the way

2042
02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:42.510
<v 4>as it were.</v>

2043
02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:47.600
Also good way to support yourself is to get some new gear if you work out to

2044
02:14:47.601 --> 02:14:48.434
boring,

2045
02:14:48.810 --> 02:14:53.270
gives them the new gear from on it by the way on it.com/jocko good place to go.

2046
02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:56.570
Good information too about starting your kettle bell workout brows.

2047
02:14:57.890 --> 02:15:02.540
And I just thought of this yesterday was in the pool with my daughter and my

2048
02:15:02.541 --> 02:15:06.260
wife was saying,
you know,
you know how like,
okay,

2049
02:15:06.261 --> 02:15:08.090
so you might seem like Bj Penn do this,

2050
02:15:08.091 --> 02:15:11.930
where he'll go on the bottom of the ocean and it'll carry this in Hawaii.

2051
02:15:13.390 --> 02:15:17.600
So I'm like,
Hey,
you could grab one of those kettlebells.
And,
and my daughter,

2052
02:15:17.601 --> 02:15:21.260
she's five.
So she was like,
good.
I was like,
yeah,
go grab the little,
it's like,

2053
02:15:21.610 --> 02:15:25.100
it's like,
it's like a Pixie or I don't know.
I don't know what it is,

2054
02:15:25.101 --> 02:15:28.720
but it's like one of those a ledge and bells.
It's a small one that,

2055
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:32.510
that I got for.
So she grabs it and she goes in the pool.
She's like,
I'm going to,

2056
02:15:32.511 --> 02:15:34.400
and I say,
yeah,
walk to the other side.
And it's like,

2057
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:39.440
she goes kind of into the deep section.
So she goes and she's carrying it.

2058
02:15:39.441 --> 02:15:42.590
She's doing the whole Bj Penn with the little kettle bells five by the way,

2059
02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:45.590
under the water.
And we're watching it.
We're like,
oh,
that's cute.

2060
02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:49.630
But she starts to sort of run out of air and she didn't want to drop the kettle

2061
02:15:49.631 --> 02:15:52.430
bell cause it's like going to slam and the bottom of the pool.
And I don't know,

2062
02:15:52.431 --> 02:15:55.070
maybe she just,
she's five,
she didn't think of that,
you know,
kind of thing.

2063
02:15:55.250 --> 02:15:57.140
So I see her trying to like swim with it,

2064
02:15:57.230 --> 02:15:59.240
like trying to get to the top and it's kind of deep pen.
I was like,

2065
02:15:59.241 --> 02:16:02.990
oh I started to get worried and then she started a little bit more urgency so I

2066
02:16:02.991 --> 02:16:05.990
had to jump in,
grab her echo with the save save.

2067
02:16:06.170 --> 02:16:08.960
But she did right when I got tour,
she put it up on the little,

2068
02:16:08.961 --> 02:16:10.700
there's a little ledge and the other side of the pool there.

2069
02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:14.630
She managed to do it just,
but just barely.
So I went in there

2070
02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:19.560
<v 3>when my middle daughter was probably eight,</v>

2071
02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:25.100
eight years old and we had a party at the beach for our birthday or a ward.

2072
02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:29.140
And so I was dealing with,
I could as long as I could,

2073
02:16:29.141 --> 02:16:31.810
I was dealing with the games and the whatever.
And finally I'm like,

2074
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:34.090
you know what?
That's it.
We're going,
we're going to get some.

2075
02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:38.260
So we formed the party up into two teams and we're going to compete against each

2076
02:16:38.261 --> 02:16:41.600
other and obstacle courses and sprints and all this other stuff's sure.

2077
02:16:42.130 --> 02:16:47.130
And this particular location has a river gentle flowing tidal river that comes

2078
02:16:48.251 --> 02:16:52.690
out.
And anyways,
one of the contest I had was,

2079
02:16:52.691 --> 02:16:56.740
okay you,
we've got a swim across and there's big rocks and stuff.
And I go,

2080
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:58.690
you gotta swim across the river and come back.

2081
02:16:58.691 --> 02:17:01.180
And whoever brings back the biggest rock is the winner.

2082
02:17:01.690 --> 02:17:04.750
So my middle daughter is tall off,

2083
02:17:05.350 --> 02:17:08.080
she's tough and she's strong.

2084
02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:13.840
She's a wrestler and gymnastics and all that crap and we're not crap and all

2085
02:17:13.841 --> 02:17:16.370
that stuff.
You know,
like she's just,
um,

2086
02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:21.910
she's a beast and she's mentally like,
I don't want to use the term psycho,

2087
02:17:21.911 --> 02:17:25.780
but like he's real determined about stuff sometimes.
So anyways,

2088
02:17:25.781 --> 02:17:28.030
this is when she's a little kid,
you know,

2089
02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:30.820
and so go,

2090
02:17:30.821 --> 02:17:34.510
go across the river and whoever brings back the biggest rock wins.

2091
02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:35.913
So she goes,

2092
02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:40.540
so they all go across and kids are grabbing rocks that are size of let's say,

2093
02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:43.810
let's say a softball,
maybe a softball.

2094
02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:47.860
What's in between the size of a softball and a soccer ball?

2095
02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:54.040
Uh,
I dunno some,
so some.
Okay.

2096
02:17:54.041 --> 02:17:58.800
Loaf of bread,
like,
like maybe a small loaf of bread.
That's the Max,
right,

2097
02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:00.220
that any of these kids are grabbing.

2098
02:18:01.090 --> 02:18:04.270
My daughter grabs something that's like the size of a,

2099
02:18:04.390 --> 02:18:08.530
like a legit watermelon.
Big Giant,
giant,

2100
02:18:08.531 --> 02:18:13.030
giant rock to hand.
Oh Two hand rock,
rob giant rock,

2101
02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:16.800
like four or five loaves of bread.
Just a big,
big giant rock.

2102
02:18:17.290 --> 02:18:18.850
And I'm watching her and I'm thinking,
well,

2103
02:18:18.851 --> 02:18:20.810
she's just going to sink to the bottom and still have to let it go and still

2104
02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:23.140
have to go back and get it smaller one.
Maybe she can still do.
Okay.

2105
02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:28.750
So she and the river has weird contours on the bottom.
You know,
you're,
you're,

2106
02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:31.880
you can walk a little while and then it just drops super deep and you just got

2107
02:18:31.881 --> 02:18:32.714
to make it.

2108
02:18:33.850 --> 02:18:37.410
So I'm watching her and she's,
she's,

2109
02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:42.220
she's hard for even carry it and she cares.
He gets to that deep section,

2110
02:18:42.221 --> 02:18:46.420
just drops down,
goes under,
and I'm waiting for it to pop up,

2111
02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:50.680
but she doesn't pop up and I'm waiting for it to pop up and she doesn't pop up

2112
02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:52.900
and a waiting for it to pop up and she doesn't pop up.

2113
02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:56.410
And then I see like an air bubble come up and I'm like,
Oh Dang.

2114
02:18:57.930 --> 02:18:59.740
But the air bubble has progressed.

2115
02:19:00.010 --> 02:19:02.500
So now I'm watching the air bubbles like progress.

2116
02:19:02.890 --> 02:19:05.190
They're coming closer to the other side and,

2117
02:19:05.930 --> 02:19:10.930
and then it starts to come up and sure enough out she comes like a,

2118
02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:15.580
like a beast.
He's in the Rock,
she comes up out of the water,

2119
02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:21.670
powered through that and brings the rock up,
drops it at my feet.

2120
02:19:21.710 --> 02:19:23.950
No great victory.
He's yours.

2121
02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:28.010
That's actually pretty powerful because Braille when

2122
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:31.790
<v 4>you're,
I mean,
unless she was like demands on our mindset,
so her,</v>

2123
02:19:31.791 --> 02:19:35.960
she was probably like,
I'm not gonna let this rock defeat me.

2124
02:19:35.961 --> 02:19:38.210
I'm going to bring to the other side.
And that's kind of the mindset.

2125
02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:43.100
I'm not going to drop it for that reason.
I think my daughter did was like,

2126
02:19:43.130 --> 02:19:47.270
I'm can't drop this thing so I'm stuck with it,
you know,
kind of thing.

2127
02:19:47.271 --> 02:19:48.710
That's what you know.
So she started,

2128
02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:52.040
you could tell she was a little bit going into panic mode.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2129
02:19:52.041 --> 02:19:56.630
So it's a whole different scenario technically.
But that's pretty savage though.

2130
02:19:57.290 --> 02:20:00.110
He do you think that I should cause she's [inaudible] she's scared.

2131
02:20:00.111 --> 02:20:03.320
She even said like later like,
oh that was like scary and all this stuff.

2132
02:20:03.350 --> 02:20:07.670
I should probably make her do it again.
Yeah.
Not make her like do it,

2133
02:20:07.700 --> 02:20:09.830
but like maybe jump in with there.
My daughter,

2134
02:20:09.890 --> 02:20:14.330
my youngest daughter just did the big cliff jump yesterday and long swim in the

2135
02:20:14.331 --> 02:20:18.830
ocean.
Open,
open ocean waters.
I know you got to get him.
And she was,
I was,

2136
02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:20.880
I thought she was gonna be panicky.
Yeah.

2137
02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:24.740
Cause it's drop and it's ocean and whatever.
And this is what's the wave action.

2138
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:29.980
But she was,
I sit down,
you're good.
And she said,
yeah,
you do it too.
Yeah,
yeah,

2139
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:30.980
yeah.
That they usually,

2140
02:20:31.130 --> 02:20:35.180
I mean unless she got traumatized by it or something like this where Brown Mike,

2141
02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:40.690
what's weird come from Hawaii.
You jump off everything.
Water.
Yeah.

2142
02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:45.350
You see,
so we have this ledge that,
you know,

2143
02:20:45.351 --> 02:20:50.120
you saw it and it's not that high,
but for a one year old it's pretty high.

2144
02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:54.890
It's pretty good.
My boy and my daughter when she was one too,
they just jump off.

2145
02:20:54.891 --> 02:20:59.420
We'd catch them,
they can't swim yet.
And my son,

2146
02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:01.550
he jumped off a few times and it was all good.

2147
02:21:01.551 --> 02:21:04.280
But then one time he went to walk in,

2148
02:21:04.281 --> 02:21:07.050
there was this little just little slight little dip and you know when you're,

2149
02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:11.690
you,
you know you're new to walk.
He slipped,
he tripped and he fell in.

2150
02:21:11.691 --> 02:21:15.590
I caught him but he full on like hate his side on the edge of the thing and he's

2151
02:21:15.591 --> 02:21:17.530
getting,
he's crying.
He's one and just,

2152
02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:21.290
just over one maybe like made him do it again.
He didn't want to do it though,

2153
02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:25.760
but so I didn't like push them again.
I just kept like,
Hey,
do it.
I got you,

2154
02:21:25.761 --> 02:21:29.480
I got you.
And He'd be like,
Eh,
you know,
crying and whatever.
And then,
you know,

2155
02:21:29.481 --> 02:21:31.190
my daughter would do it,
I would do it.

2156
02:21:31.191 --> 02:21:34.970
Then he finally like reluctantly did it and we cheered for him and now he's all

2157
02:21:34.971 --> 02:21:38.970
good.
Good to go.
Like forces himself.
He makes me catch them now.
Cheese,

2158
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:43.370
he's like almost too.
Anyway.
But yeah.
The,
the point is you make them do it again,

2159
02:21:43.371 --> 02:21:47.390
right?
Yeah.
But you're very accurate in saying don't traumatize him.

2160
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:51.170
Like going right down the hall,
come off now it's just getting worse.
You're not,

2161
02:21:51.171 --> 02:21:55.250
you're not,
you know,
it's like the hey do it.
Gee,
you should do it.

2162
02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.110
Oh you want to take a little break?
That's okay.
But you know,

2163
02:21:57.111 --> 02:21:59.690
you should definitely do this is it,
you've already done it before.

2164
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:04.390
You don't want to traumatize them worse.
That's not going to work out good.
Yeah.

2165
02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:07.700
Especially with the Waterman.
Cause it's like,
it's one minute,

2166
02:22:07.730 --> 02:22:10.940
it's all fun and games and literally your mind can flipped.
You know,

2167
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:13.070
like I'm about to die.
I used to say this,

2168
02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:18.500
so in the 90s in the seal teams when there was no war going on and whatever,

2169
02:22:20.391 --> 02:22:24.170
you'd go out and you do training.
There was times I would always tell guys,

2170
02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:26.010
when you're working in the water,
it's

2171
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:29.420
<v 3>a real world mission.
Like we didn't know what a real world mission got.</v>

2172
02:22:29.430 --> 02:22:30.091
Never been on one.

2173
02:22:30.091 --> 02:22:33.360
But the fact of the matter is when you're working with the water,

2174
02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:37.080
it's a real world mission because if you screw something up you can easily die

2175
02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:40.800
easily.
If you're not careful,
one up,
one down,
just going to throw it out there.

2176
02:22:40.801 --> 02:22:43.680
If you're doing any kind of this training and you're training the water,

2177
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:45.240
one person stays up on the surface.

2178
02:22:45.241 --> 02:22:47.700
The of the person you know and be a lifeguard,

2179
02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:50.760
you don't do simultaneous training in the water.

2180
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:53.850
So just throwing that out there was a little safety note for everyone.
One Up,

2181
02:22:53.851 --> 02:22:55.650
one down.
That's the rule.
Yes.

2182
02:22:55.710 --> 02:23:00.510
And especially if you're carrying the kettle bells from audit or otherwise at

2183
02:23:00.570 --> 02:23:03.270
the bottom of the pool,
the bottom of the ocean,

2184
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:08.280
bottom of a reservoir,
bottom of anybody have water.
Yup.

2185
02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:11.670
One Up,
one down,
one on one day.
Nonetheless.

2186
02:23:11.671 --> 02:23:15.180
So that's how we utilize the Pixie.
I think it's called Pixi.

2187
02:23:15.181 --> 02:23:17.520
It's one of the legend belts.
Anyway,
if,

2188
02:23:18.090 --> 02:23:21.930
I guess that doesn't really have much to do with what on it offers,
but it just,

2189
02:23:21.931 --> 02:23:24.770
I just thought of that cause it just happened nonetheless.
Hey,

2190
02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:28.250
he was represented in the story.
Boom.
Anyway,

2191
02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:30.960
if you want cool fitness stuff on it.
DOTCOM slash Jocko.

2192
02:23:30.961 --> 02:23:35.190
A lot of good information on there.
Some socks on there.
I mentioned the socks,

2193
02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:37.530
like it's like this big deal.
And here's the thing.

2194
02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:42.660
It is on its socks of the TSA.
The other day I had to stun on like on.

2195
02:23:42.661 --> 02:23:45.810
It sucks,
right?
Issues,
you know,
they're looking,
they're like,

2196
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:48.930
those are dope sucks.
Anyway,
I ended up on slash chocolate.
It's a good spot.

2197
02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:53.580
A psychological warfare is an album that you can get where I talk about stuff of

2198
02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:57.810
overcoming when you have little moments of weakness and I'm gonna make another

2199
02:23:57.811 --> 02:24:01.200
one good and make another one.
Got a gun plotting on it.
Good.

2200
02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:05.100
It looks like it's going to be called.
All your excuses are lies.
Yes.
Good.

2201
02:24:05.101 --> 02:24:08.280
I could title you get that iTunes,

2202
02:24:08.310 --> 02:24:11.970
Google play wherever.
MP3S herself.
Yeah man.

2203
02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:18.200
Amazon and also Jocko white tea people have now seen that we have cans of Jocko

2204
02:24:19.291 --> 02:24:22.170
white tea.
Where do you get them?
You get them on Amazon if you want them.

2205
02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:25.530
It tastes awesome.
You can get the dried tea on there too,

2206
02:24:25.650 --> 02:24:28.470
which you've had water to.
And then you brew it.

2207
02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:32.880
And then if either one,
you're going to get an 8,000 pound deadlift.

2208
02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:34.400
So that's cool you do that.

2209
02:24:34.690 --> 02:24:39.570
Got Some books where the warrior kid and Mark's mission two books.

2210
02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:44.220
Which one do you like better?
Do I like better?

2211
02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:47.020
I can't say because the first one,
the Oji,

2212
02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.120
the original one from wimpy to warrior will always have.

2213
02:24:51.690 --> 02:24:56.010
That's the one that established establishes the ethos in my house anyway.

2214
02:24:56.550 --> 02:25:01.230
Um,
but yeah,
no,
I can't say.
I think they're both outstanding,

2215
02:25:01.470 --> 02:25:06.280
but it's good how you evolve the issues,
you know,
like it's like bull basically.

2216
02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:09.540
Think about how many people were like,
oh,
you're going to write more.
Well,
yeah.

2217
02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:10.411
What are you gonna write about?

2218
02:25:10.411 --> 02:25:13.140
Think about all the issues you have as a human being and then you think about

2219
02:25:13.141 --> 02:25:15.900
all the issues you had as a kid.
Like we're going to cover all of us.
Yeah.

2220
02:25:15.901 --> 02:25:19.220
That's like 10 books,
right?
Uncle Jake's got some help for you.
So yeah,

2221
02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:21.440
way the warrior kid books,
they,

2222
02:25:21.470 --> 02:25:25.300
the one thing that's cool is people as a parent,
you're like,
man,

2223
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:29.290
how do I get my kid to even something as stupid as cleaning your room,
right.

2224
02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:32.860
How do you get your kid to clean your room?
Hadn't read this book.
I got pictures,

2225
02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:35.090
I got,
I just got a picture on Twitter the other day.

2226
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:39.940
Kids kind a vacuum cleaner and the dad's a pump it pump.
He's like,

2227
02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:42.880
look at this.
That's a real thing.

2228
02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:46.930
<v 4>Even as I'm like,
okay,
so kids read the book of course,</v>

2229
02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:50.860
but I read it to my daughter who was four at the time for,
yeah.

2230
02:25:51.310 --> 02:25:55.690
So I'm reading it and it's answering a bunch of questions I have.
So it's like,

2231
02:25:55.691 --> 02:25:58.500
hey,
you know,
my kid,
you know,
my daughter was like,
okay,

2232
02:25:58.510 --> 02:26:01.490
what do you mean parenting questions?
Yes,
exactly.
Right.
So,

2233
02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:02.800
and it's just little stuff,

2234
02:26:02.801 --> 02:26:06.100
little stuff sometimes you won't even really think of.
So like,
okay,
for example,

2235
02:26:06.101 --> 02:26:07.290
and I said,
I mentioned this one before,

2236
02:26:07.310 --> 02:26:10.750
but it's a huge deal that I still use it like it's on the front of my mind every

2237
02:26:10.751 --> 02:26:11.440
single time.

2238
02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.230
So you know how like you'll have a kid and they'll be like real good at

2239
02:26:14.231 --> 02:26:16.030
something,
just kind of right away.

2240
02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:18.820
Maybe your kids more athletic or something and maybe they're bigger,
taller,

2241
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:21.130
whatever.
So they kind of win real quick,
you know?

2242
02:26:22.090 --> 02:26:25.990
So when they run into a situation where they're in an activity that actually

2243
02:26:25.991 --> 02:26:29.890
requires practice,
like a cartwheel or something like this.

2244
02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:34.900
And so my daughter,
she's being,
she's athletic little girl,
way bigger,

2245
02:26:34.901 --> 02:26:38.800
she's a,
you know,
and so she has this friend,
same age,
she's like a week,

2246
02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:40.180
either older or younger,
I forget,

2247
02:26:40.210 --> 02:26:43.510
but they're the same age and she can do a cartwheel and just fly through

2248
02:26:43.511 --> 02:26:46.340
cartwheels.
One handed cartwheels hold this stuff,
this other girl can,

2249
02:26:46.341 --> 02:26:51.250
she is way smaller in a way,
whatever.
So my daughter,
she doesn't like that.

2250
02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:55.220
Not the fact that the girl can,
but just she can't.
So she tries to do it.

2251
02:26:55.810 --> 02:27:00.550
She can kind of starts,
you know,
it's a whole thing.

2252
02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:02.500
It's very upsetting.

2253
02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:07.740
So uncle Jake said something in the first one that this will always stick with

2254
02:27:09.061 --> 02:27:10.240
me when she complained to me about it.

2255
02:27:10.241 --> 02:27:12.730
You can't grow and do a cartwheel and how Malia can do a cartwheel,

2256
02:27:12.731 --> 02:27:13.770
but I can and all this stuff

2257
02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:16.920
<v 3>I see.
And that cool uncle Jake,</v>

2258
02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:21.330
<v 4>how do you expect to be good at something when you've never practiced the boom?</v>

2259
02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:23.880
Just like the times table.
Yeah.
I ain't gonna be good at times,
so it wouldn't,

2260
02:27:23.881 --> 02:27:27.150
he never studied,
you know,
and it makes it known how to do a cartwheel.

2261
02:27:27.850 --> 02:27:31.560
You're not born knowing how to do a cartwheel.
Just like,
oh,
you know,

2262
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:33.950
our other neighbor can play the guitar.
You know,
how much practice,
you know,

2263
02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:37.470
kind of thing.
And it's crazy because just that simple line right there,

2264
02:27:37.890 --> 02:27:41.400
she was four and she understands,
you know,
she's like practicing breath.
Anyway,

2265
02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:42.540
that's how,
that's how they look.

2266
02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:44.380
<v 3>Good Warrior kid books.</v>

2267
02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:47.710
There's two of them were the were your kid and Mark's mission.
You can get those.

2268
02:27:47.711 --> 02:27:51.640
You can also get disappointed equals freedom.
The field manual.
Yeah.
Field manual.

2269
02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.790
How to get after it.
Yeah.
Simple as that.

2270
02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:58.270
The audio version of that is not on audible.

2271
02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:03.400
It's on Itunes,
Amazon,
music,
all that stuff.
Also,
extreme ownership.

2272
02:28:03.401 --> 02:28:06.480
Extreme ownership is on audible and I just looked,

2273
02:28:06.490 --> 02:28:11.290
it was number two on apple,

2274
02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:14.620
audible books,
whatever that's called.
Apple I books or something.

2275
02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:18.400
Number two right now.
The book's been out for almost three years.
What is apple?

2276
02:28:18.401 --> 02:28:22.820
I books.
It's where you can get books for your eye.
For audio books.
Yeah.
Sorry.

2277
02:28:23.230 --> 02:28:26.290
Yeah,
yeah,
no worries.
Oh,
speaking of books,
by the way,
it,

2278
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:31.140
if you want to get this one.
Oh unit seven 31 31 yeah.

2279
02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:34.590
I'm putting on the lens unit seven 31 just that.
Yeah.

2280
02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:39.830
That subtitle is Japan secret biological warfare in World War II.

2281
02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:44.870
Yeah.
Dark book,
but see,
really see strongly.

2282
02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:49.670
I feel strongly that that's like one,
you can't know.
One are crazy,

2283
02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:53.480
but yeah.
Anyway,
I'm gonna put them on our website,
Jocko podcast.

2284
02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:56.540
Someone just hit me up on Twitter that he's like,
hey,
we,

2285
02:28:57.530 --> 02:29:00.590
we had a long road trip for 4th of July,

2286
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:02.780
my wife,

2287
02:29:02.781 --> 02:29:06.740
me and my kids aged 13 whatever.

2288
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:09.860
Listen to one 21 one 22 and one 23.
Yeah.

2289
02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:15.310
That's real significant.
I,
you know,

2290
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:19.550
I don't,
I don't know if I want to say it family time,
but like that's a real,

2291
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:23.780
the compared to the other things that you could be doing in the car,

2292
02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:25.790
that's a real good thing to do in your car.

2293
02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:30.080
Introduce your kids to hit better history,
a bit of human nature,

2294
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:34.310
a bit of the darkness of the world,
a bit of overcoming that darkness.

2295
02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:38.630
That's pretty cool.
These are the kinds of books.
Well,
so that's that.
But yeah,

2296
02:29:38.631 --> 02:29:39.860
these books,
you're,

2297
02:29:39.890 --> 02:29:42.470
you're saying he's the kind of books you kind of want to have.
It's,

2298
02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:43.730
I think it's important too.

2299
02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:47.750
I think it's important to know what's going on and know what has happened in the

2300
02:29:47.751 --> 02:29:52.690
world.
As I said.
Yeah.
You want to check that out?
Yeah.
Uh,
but yeah,

2301
02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:55.050
we'll put it on the,
on the website.
That's the point.
I'm gonna have a,

2302
02:29:55.550 --> 02:30:00.050
or we have it on the page books from that puzzle.
It's all by episode.

2303
02:30:00.051 --> 02:30:03.560
So this one's from obviously one 33 yep.
And,
and,

2304
02:30:03.650 --> 02:30:06.680
and also you've got on the website cause extreme ownership,

2305
02:30:06.681 --> 02:30:09.980
which I are talking about is the first book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin

2306
02:30:10.010 --> 02:30:12.950
and we wrote another book which is called the dichotomy of leadership.

2307
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:18.200
That's also on the website,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.
And yeah,

2308
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:23.230
so that's coming out September 25th if you want to get that on the first a dish.

2309
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:27.370
Yeah man,
you can go for the third a dish though.

2310
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:30.590
What's the difference between third and third edition in seventh edition?

2311
02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:35.240
Nothing.
Just same.
What's the different between first the dish and second a dish?

2312
02:30:35.390 --> 02:30:39.560
Well it's,
you are in the game.
It's kind of like the difference if you take,

2313
02:30:39.561 --> 02:30:44.561
if you run a race or if you're recognized and not recognized,

2314
02:30:44.691 --> 02:30:49.240
but let's say you run a race.
You first,
okay,
first place guys,

2315
02:30:49.270 --> 02:30:54.080
second got third place guy all get metals.
What is,
what is the metal made out of?

2316
02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:56.420
We'll just say metal for lack of better term.

2317
02:30:57.080 --> 02:31:01.460
What's the difference between the metal gold?
No,
nothing.
Only the color.

2318
02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:06.940
Psychological.
Oh,
it's all made the same stuff.
Bad analogy.
Yeah.

2319
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:09.980
I don't even follow it,
but first edition,
that's the point.

2320
02:31:09.981 --> 02:31:12.450
That's what on talking to me first year,

2321
02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:17.730
and also if you want to bring myself Leif Babin JP

2322
02:31:20.310 --> 02:31:21.720
<v 0>to know Dave Burke.</v>

2323
02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:26.460
We got Mike Cirelli got Flint Cochran now on the team.

2324
02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:30.150
If you need help with leadership in your organization or whatever kind of

2325
02:31:30.151 --> 02:31:32.460
organization it is,
you can hit us up.

2326
02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:37.620
Ashkelon front is the name of the company.
We solve problems through leadership.

2327
02:31:37.650 --> 02:31:40.220
Ashkelon front dot cog.
Get some.

2328
02:31:41.250 --> 02:31:46.250
We have one more muster in 2018 it is in San Francisco.

2329
02:31:46.381 --> 02:31:50.790
It's October 17th and 18th
it's going to sell out.
I was,

2330
02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.490
I just got an update from Jamie today.

2331
02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:56.480
The OPS director at echelon front ensure.

2332
02:31:56.670 --> 02:32:00.810
She was saying that we're going to sell out a lot sooner than we thought,

2333
02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:04.710
so if you want to come up there,
extreme ownership.com the monster.

2334
02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:10.560
I'll put,
I got a video to post about that too.
I haven't posted it yet,
but yeah,

2335
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:11.663
that's that.

2336
02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:16.020
Also on top of the muster we have the roll call,

2337
02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:20.760
which is for police,
military,
law enforcement,

2338
02:32:20.761 --> 02:32:23.700
firefighters and first responders.
It's for people in uniform.

2339
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:27.240
That's happening September 21st in Dallas,
Texas.

2340
02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:30.600
It's only one day so you don't have to miss too much work.

2341
02:32:30.630 --> 02:32:35.280
It's a lower price point so you can afford it or you can get your organization

2342
02:32:35.281 --> 02:32:39.090
to pay for it a little easier.
Come on down to that.
It's a great program.

2343
02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:43.500
I just finished putting together the agenda yesterday and so come on down

2344
02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:50.010
until then if you want to kick it with us just a little bit more.
Sure.

2345
02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:54.120
Virtually until we are together live,
which we will be,

2346
02:32:54.121 --> 02:32:57.990
we'll be together live at the muster in San Francisco or at the roll call in

2347
02:32:57.991 --> 02:33:02.130
Dallas,
Texas or at the immersion camp in Maine.
We'll see you at one of those,

2348
02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:07.110
but until then,
if you do want to kick it with us,
we will be on the interwebs,

2349
02:33:07.350 --> 02:33:11.500
on Twitter,
on Instagram,
and on that base.

2350
02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:16.510
That bulky ball echo is that echo Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and of

2351
02:33:17.641 --> 02:33:20.730
course to all the military personnel that are listening.

2352
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:22.343
<v 2>Okay,</v>

2353
02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:28.300
<v 0>you provide the freedom that allows us to do what we do every day.</v>

2354
02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:32.780
You also hold the line against the evil that we talked about today.

2355
02:33:33.890 --> 02:33:38.210
So thank you to police,
law enforcement,
firefighters,
paramedics,

2356
02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:40.790
border patrol,
other first responders.

2357
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:45.290
You actually provide this safety that allows us to do what we do every day.

2358
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:50.290
So thanks to you and to the families that support all those that serve.

2359
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:52.783
<v 2>Thank you</v>

2360
02:33:53.730 --> 02:33:58.730
<v 0>for supporting those families that serve and to everyone else that's listening.</v>

2361
02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:04.170
Thank you for listening.
Thanks for supporting.
I know it was a rough list.

2362
02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:09.450
I know it is.
It's rough for me to read.
It's rough for me to talk about,

2363
02:34:09.451 --> 02:34:13.770
but it's also reality and if you don't face reality,
you can't fix it.

2364
02:34:13.771 --> 02:34:17.440
If you don't face your past,
you can't learn from it.

2365
02:34:18.730 --> 02:34:20.530
So what you have to do is you have to face him,

2366
02:34:20.531 --> 02:34:24.130
you have to face what scares you,

2367
02:34:24.250 --> 02:34:28.180
you have to face what bothers you.
You have to face your weaknesses.

2368
02:34:28.181 --> 02:34:32.800
And face your fears and face your own darkness.
Face them,

2369
02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:34.263
own them,

2370
02:34:35.170 --> 02:34:38.740
and overcome them all by stepping up

2371
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:44.800
and getting after it.
And until next time,

2372
02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:48.640
this is echo and Jocko out.
