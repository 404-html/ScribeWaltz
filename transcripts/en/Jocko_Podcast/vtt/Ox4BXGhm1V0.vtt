This is Jocko podcast number 86 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.670
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.870
And it has been a little while since we got down to some Q and a.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.370
Sure.
And on top of that,
on the social media,

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.970
I have not been as responsive as I normally am.

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.270
I've had to prioritize and execute a bunch of other things,

7
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.070
things like muster things like books that are due,
things like that.

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.410
So,
and a bunch of travel and a bunch of work with echelon front,

9
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.380
et Cetera,
et cetera.
So,
but I do get the questions,

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.230
I read the questions I read that I read.

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.620
If you post something and you tag me in it on Twitter or you put a comment on

12
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.350
Instagram,
I read it 100%.
Yeah,
I read it.

13
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.310
But lately and normally I would like everything that I see.
Sure.

14
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.170
I would like it just,
just so you know,
hey,
I saw her down.
Yeah,
I'm here.

15
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.700
I heard you.
But lately I haven't been able to do that.
Dang.
So,
so I've just been,

16
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.370
I read it,
move,
read it,
move,
read to move.
Uh,

17
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.810
but if there's a good question comes up,
I copy it,
I paste it,

18
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.000
I put it in the,
in the question bank.

19
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.160
And then when we get to do a Q and a,

20
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.460
we answer the questions that I think either they get asked a bunch,

21
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.150
you know,
so I've seen a question four or five times that type of question.
Yeah.

22
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.320
Or just a unique question that I think a lot of people can benefit from and

23
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:41.190
that's where we ended up with.
So today Q and a.

24
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.200
And let's rock and roll.
First question,

25
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.990
I do want to add that on Twitter,
both throw seed also,
you know,

26
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:54.990
you say you like everything,
you know.
Yes.
Certain things,

27
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.120
sometimes they don't necessarily warrant like you liking them,

28
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.590
they require an answer,
you know,
like you can't like that.

29
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.580
Like let's say someone has this like really trying time or something and they

30
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:08.460
say something or whatever and it's a question like,
hey,

31
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.460
how do I get through this?
You can't dislike it and move on.
Okay,
I can do that.

32
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.880
So what I do in those situations is I like it.

33
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.930
I copied the question and I put it in the question bank all.
Okay.

34
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.280
So you're like,
is my like,

35
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.780
has various meanings in my life does not mean like,
yeah.
Yeah.

36
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.780
My like means received.
Gotcha.
Yes.
Yeah.
And it,
and,

37
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.650
and it is a heart,

38
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.830
which I vehemently disagree,
disapprove of,
and disagree with.

39
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.900
No,
no.
Come on Bro.
Come on.
No,

40
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.070
no hearts juncos world,
right?
Yes sir.
So,

41
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.920
well,
I do.
It's my way of saying I read it,

42
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.700
but what I'm saying is it's saying that I'm ready.

43
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.110
I'm telling you that right at this,
the past,
like week,
I've read everything.

44
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.160
I always read everything,
but I haven't

45
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.460
<v 1>even liked him because I haven't had time to start liking them.
Dang.
Yes.</v>

46
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.010
Because if I like it,

47
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.070
that tells me that I've gone through it and if I had to pull something from it,

48
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.480
it's how I keep track of what I've read and what not,
just what I've read.

49
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:21.481
It's how I keep track of what I have extracted pertinent information from.

50
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.030
Yeah.
I might have to start doing the opposite.

51
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.360
Only like something if I want to go back to it.
Oh yeah,
like a bookmark.
Yeah.

52
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.280
Maybe I'll start doing that anyways.
If you're out there,

53
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm reading your messages,
your tweets,

54
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.150
your posts.
Right.
I appreciate it.
It's all good feedback.
It's awesome.
Yeah,

55
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.590
but sometimes you get yours,
you're in the initial post,

56
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.450
we'll say and maybe I'm in there,

57
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:51.430
maybe some other people and then other people chime in.

58
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.480
Then it starts to morph into this conversation between two other people.

59
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.060
You can't really like those necessary.
I usually do,

60
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.100
but just to keep track of where I am.
Just like,
oh yeah.

61
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.960
See like the bookmark it to bookmark.

62
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.990
So this you talking right now is just one big mass like you guys saying,

63
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.510
hey guys are ready.
Here it is.
You're less.
Yes.
I like you like you all.
All right.

64
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.470
We're not even,
I like you all cause some of your comments I don't like.
Yeah,

65
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.350
I still like them though.
Yeah.
Verb like yeah.
Yeah.
I like a press,

66
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:23.860
like even though you said something and I don't agree with,
so I still,

67
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.870
I liked like back that you expressed yourself.

68
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.120
So even if I hate what you said,
you still get a little heart.

69
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.150
There you go.
They should have one that's an eye look,
a picture of an eye.

70
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.750
Like I've seen this.
That's what it means and all right.
Right.
And I have a ball.

71
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.200
I saw this,
I saw this,
he saw this.
And then you could say like,

72
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.330
and you should have a thumbs down.
Dislike.
Yeah.
Look on Youtube.
Yeah.

73
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.280
Yeah.
Either way.
There you go.
Alright,
first question.

74
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.353
Hey Jocko.

75
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.980
I'm a 35 year old and have a physically demanding job.

76
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.290
I've been a dry Waller for about 14 years.
Work about eight to 10 hours a day.

77
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.700
When it comes to working out,

78
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:10.990
I'm finding it really hard to maintain discipline to continue as it seen as it

79
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:15.220
seems.
I burnout also have two boys under the age of four,

80
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.950
so I sleep like you do.
I can relate,
man.
Yeah.

81
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.770
I'm wondering if I'm just being a pussy and need to push through the burnout or

82
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:26.920
take a different approach to working out when I burned out,

83
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:30.160
my buddy just feels weird as well as my head.

84
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.520
I tend to get depressed and find it hard to even go to work.

85
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.610
Just throwing this out there for maybe some tips to get over this so I can stay

86
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:43.690
focused and consistent.
Thanks.
Cool.
Okay,

87
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:48.470
so hanging drywall.
Have you ever hung drywall before?
No.
Yes.
No late.

88
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.070
Yes.
Okay.
I better know what the answer means.

89
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.390
I've been in a dry wall hanging scenario scenario.
Yes,

90
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.690
but I didn't do the pain of the,
okay.
Yeah.

91
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.210
<v 0>That does not qualify as it beat Bro.</v>

92
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.470
You do not get called for heavier drywall if you seen it being hard.

93
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.830
I appreciate what you're trying to say,
but that doesn't work then you can.

94
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:11.330
Dry Wall is hard work.
Yes sir.

95
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.040
It uses a bunch of different muscles in your body and of course when you get

96
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.570
better at it,
cause I'm not good at it.
When I,
when I hung dry,

97
00:06:18.571 --> 00:06:22.310
when I hang drywall,
if I'm doing a project,
I'm not good at it.

98
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.330
If you see someone that's good at,

99
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.160
like this guy that's been hanging drywall for 14 years,
he's a master.
He's,

100
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.130
he's holding one hand slapping nails him.

101
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:35.360
He's or dry wall screws on stilts.
Guys work on stilts.
You ever seen that before?

102
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.620
No.
No.
So good drywall.
They're on stilts because they don't,
they're just boom,

103
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.040
slap it up there.
So,
but it's hard.
You're doing,

104
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.450
you're basically doing a clean,
kind of pull the drywall up,

105
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:50.150
you're pushing it up or you're using your grip strength and the drywall.

106
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.770
Then you're doing overhead presses cause you dry wall ceilings sometimes.

107
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.430
So,
and it's eight to 10 hours plus,
not to mention you're,

108
00:06:58.431 --> 00:06:59.930
you're bending down picking stuff up all day.

109
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:01.610
So it's eight to 10 hours of squats,

110
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.810
cleans and overhead presses with grip work.

111
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.720
So you're doing that eight to 10 hours a day.

112
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.950
So you're getting good physical work throughout the day.

113
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.330
Now look man,
if you're that drained,

114
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.700
then first of all,
let's check the Diet.

115
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.120
Let's make sure that we're not on the job site and the donut truck arrives and

116
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.590
you're,

117
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.970
you're going belly up to the donut truck with a monster for monster energy

118
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.030
drinks.
Like to keep you going through the day that's going to hurt you.

119
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.800
So check the Diet.

120
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.660
It's the good thing is check a diet and then if you have to just bring your

121
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:39.110
food,

122
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.110
don't let you know your bro that's going to run down to Mickey D's to grab lunch

123
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.910
cause you didn't pack anything that's going to jack you up.

124
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.560
So all that stuff will make you feel weak and out of sorts and all that.

125
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.300
That being said,
it's still,
you're working hard all day.

126
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.810
You're doing hard physical labor all day.
You also,

127
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.690
I mean you can see construction workers were dry drywall as you can see people

128
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:06.530
that are due that hard labor all day and they don't look like they're in shape

129
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.770
right there.
Maybe their fat,
maybe they're just,

130
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.460
they don't look like they're in shape.
Well that's cause their diet sucks.

131
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.310
Generally they're coming home and they're getting on their,

132
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.880
their 12 pack of beer and pizza.

133
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.570
So get your Diet,
make sure your dad's going to go.

134
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.120
And then what I would do is,

135
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:31.070
and I've worked construction before and or even big projects on my house where

136
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:35.510
I'm working all day long remodelling pulling down drywall,

137
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.960
putting up drywall,
demo in rooms,
whatever.
Uh,

138
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.700
I still do work out.

139
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.010
Now what you're going to do though is do something that is going to compliment

140
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.800
what you've done during the day.

141
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.390
So you're getting some pretty good strength work at this point.
You're getting,

142
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.940
you know,
you're getting cleaned,
your work,
you're doing all this,

143
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.600
this hard work all throughout the day.

144
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:02.601
So maybe what you need to do is do some more cardiovascular at night or maybe

145
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.410
it's just like a really good stretching routine cause you got your strength and

146
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:08.910
you got your cardio do during the day.

147
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.230
Like if I think about how much I sweat when I'm working on a house project,

148
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.760
I'm going to full athletic sweat.
So that means I'm working hard.

149
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.200
So find what can you do that's going to compliment the,

150
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.770
the conditioning that you're getting from your actual labor.

151
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.360
And maybe in your case it might just be like straight up mobility.

152
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.220
It might be straight up mobility.
Like hey,

153
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:34.800
you're just doing some good stretching,
you're doing some MobilityWOD.

154
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.220
That's mobility workout of the day.
You can go to that website.

155
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:41.370
They got really good stuff on there to to loosen up and make sure you're staying

156
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.290
limber because another thing you find with construction guys is they end up with

157
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:50.350
some,
you know with a bad back with a bad,
they get,
you know,

158
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.340
tendonitis from swinging a hammer all day or holding it so you can get those

159
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:56.670
kind of use overuse injuries and yeah,

160
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:59.490
so I would look at what you can do that's going to compliment that.
Also,

161
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.200
maybe you feel like maybe you just need to do some heavy lifting because you're

162
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:07.230
lifting something little all day.
You know who you're lifting drywall all day,

163
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.420
so you're getting some good endurance,
muscular endurance,

164
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.740
but maybe just come home and do,

165
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.430
do a couple sets of heavy dead lifts are a couple of sets of heavy squats.

166
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.580
And the other thing here is like when we're on deployment,

167
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.480
when I was back in the,
in,
when I was in the military,
when we were on deployment,

168
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:27.180
we wouldn't be doing workouts that are going to give you the,

169
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.380
the four days of delayed onset muscular soreness,
right?

170
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.410
You're not going to hurt locker is you're not going to put you in the pain

171
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:38.520
locker where,
hey,
I did squats yesterday.
Oh,
echo just got shot.

172
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.180
I can't help him too tired to sword broken.

173
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:44.310
Someone grab echo cause my legs were super sore.

174
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.470
My quads are hurting from front squats yesterday.

175
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.910
So that's not what I'm talking about.

176
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.430
I'm talking about doing some something that's heavy,

177
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:52.380
but it's quick and you're not,
you know,

178
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:56.220
you're not going crazy and doing so many sets that you're going to build up all

179
00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:59.430
kinds of lactic acid and make your legs all sore.
So maybe it's something that,

180
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:03.480
but I would say explore all that.
Look what you can find that's gonna make you,

181
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.190
that's going to compliment what you do at work.

182
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.970
And also you could look some Jujitsu,
you know,
look at some Jujitsu,
Jujitsu.

183
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.530
Although at first it's a crazy muscular workout,

184
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.150
a full body workout like you've never had before because you're resisting every

185
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:22.560
part of your movement and you'll be sore your entire body.

186
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.210
But then as you get better at it,
you can relax more.
That takes like a year,

187
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:30.750
year and a half,
maybe even two years before you can really start to relax.

188
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.230
The thing that's cool about that for you is you've got two kids under the age of

189
00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:34.441
four,

190
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:37.080
so maybe in two or three years they're ready to start training to now you've got

191
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.260
to get something to share with them.
A little bit of the Jujitsu,
so yeah.

192
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.470
Don't kill yourself.
Find something that compliments your work.

193
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.200
And if that's just stretching,
Ben,
just stretch.
Yeah,

194
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.320
and maybe you don't.
I used to do it,
uh,
when I was a team to team tea,

195
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:58.180
we sued,
we used to run all the time.
It was every day.
It was like,

196
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.550
oh,
Monday,
PT in Iran,

197
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.410
Tuesday swimming around Wednesday,
obstacle course,

198
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.270
and Iran,
Thursday,
I forget what it was.
And then Friday was a long run.

199
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.360
It was like a 12 mile runner,
10 mile run on Fridays.

200
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.340
So what I would do is I would get done with work on Friday or get done with a PT

201
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:22.650
on Friday and usually we'd be like half,
half day frogman Friday.
Sure.

202
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.780
Strongly on Friday.
Get some pre war,
no war going on.

203
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:30.310
Guess what you do on Friday afternoon and the trims you're going to go,
you know,

204
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:34.810
get after it with your boys
in the bar and the bar.
Sure.
Yeah.

205
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:39.070
Frontline Friday frogman Friday again frogman Friday kind of went away once

206
00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:42.450
September 11th happened,
so,
but this is pre September 11th frogman Fridays.

207
00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:47.230
So we get done with work at know noon and I would just Friday go down and hit my

208
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:52.231
squats and then so Friday I'd heal up Saturday and Sunday back to work on

209
00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:54.020
Sunday.
Ready to rock and roll.
Yeah.

210
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.120
So maybe you hit just do a good workout on Friday.
Yeah.

211
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.250
Good hard workout on Friday.
He'll up over the weekend.

212
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:04.810
You're feeling good Monday back in the game.
But yeah,
hard labor.

213
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:05.800
Yeah.

214
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.760
Requires something a little bit different than those of you that are sitting at

215
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:14.680
a desk looking at a computer screen like Echo Charles.
Yes sir.
Yeah.

216
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:18.250
You can do different kinds of workout when you do that all day for sure.

217
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.680
You mentioned the Diet.

218
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:26.100
I would say with 99% certainty,
I would say I don't know everybody.
Right.

219
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.110
I understand that 99% certainty that if you have a good day and not even have

220
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.640
immaculate a good diet and you're working drywall construction moving as I used

221
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:42.930
to be a mover for a little bit.
Yeah.
If you have a good diet,

222
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.740
I mean you watched moving cause apparently in your mind that qualifies for,

223
00:13:47.741 --> 00:13:49.000
you know it just total victory.

224
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.570
<v 2>Yeah.
Anyway.
Oh I know you were an actual yeah,</v>

225
00:13:53.571 --> 00:13:57.880
but I wasn't the best mover.
I was one on one.
Anyway,
that's a,

226
00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.000
that's a whole nother thing anyway.

227
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.360
If you have a good diet and you're doing this kind of work,

228
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.420
that is your workout essentially,
and it's a long one.

229
00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:09.800
It's probably a hard to work out than most people's normal workouts you do.

230
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.770
And that's the thing.
You're so right because when you're working eight,

231
00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:16.100
10 hours a day,
there's a lot of work to be done.
So your lunch break is like,

232
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.420
Dang,
this is,
I'm going to go to get some delicious,
you know,

233
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.880
to this food truck right here or this,
you know,
and will wherever,

234
00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:26.780
wherever it's not,
you know,
but you get a good diet with this kind of stuff.

235
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.280
You essentially have a great workout along with a good diet.

236
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.080
You're going to get results.
Just that.

237
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.400
And in a way you won't even really have to do these supplemental workouts unless

238
00:14:37.401 --> 00:14:41.840
you have different goals.
So if you're like,
okay,
I'm just going to do my work,

239
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.090
I'm going to have a good diet,
and then I stretch afterwards,

240
00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:48.560
which is such a good idea when you call day,
same motion all day,

241
00:14:48.561 --> 00:14:52.040
stretch,
you know,
get all that.
But you'll be way better.
You'll way better to him.

242
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.450
<v 0>You'd be surprised how,
how much easier the work becomes with that diet.</v>

243
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.390
And also maybe there's,
like I said,
you need to look for what compliments it.

244
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.690
Yeah.
So with dry wall,
I don't,
I don't know.
You know,

245
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:05.270
it's probably not dead lifting cause you left lifting stuff all day,

246
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.990
but maybe it's just like some hardcore,
uh,

247
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.230
like Ab core strength that you're going to work.
You're going to,
you know,

248
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.540
and that's going to strengthen your lower back.

249
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:17.510
It's going to offset all the pressure that you put on your back all day.

250
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.440
So maybe it's that,
maybe it's,
you know,

251
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.930
pull ups because you're not really pulling yourself up.

252
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.090
So maybe you're doing two workouts.

253
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.980
Maybe we're doing like one workout on Fridays.

254
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:33.070
You do an abs and pull ups and then during the week you're doing a 20 minute

255
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:37.670
stretch session to really make sure your hips are opened up.

256
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.950
Right.
Of course,
like them guys from 10th Plan as Uga.

257
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:47.480
It's got to be flexible.
They're flexible.
That's the,
you have to be,

258
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:50.180
you have to be able to do Lotus to get your black belt from Eddie Bravo.

259
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.360
There you go.
I can't do the Lotus.
I can't get my black belt from Eddie Bravo.
No,

260
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.580
no,
no.
You can't.
No,
sorry bro.

261
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.300
I should be able to do that at some point.
Depends on what you mean by should,

262
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.620
but yeah,
man.
Cool.
Do the Lotus and then work on that and you know,
report back.

263
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:07.881
But yeah,
the Diet thing,

264
00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:12.500
I think the Diet thing that's going to be 75 if not more personal people,

265
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:16.040
he'll be up there.
You,
they say,
Oh,
you don't sleep enough and how do you not see,

266
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.570
don't eat crap.
You don't need as much sleep.
Yeah,
check that out.

267
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.500
Give that one a try.
Yeah.
And listen,
let's face it,

268
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.090
there's people can be different with requirements.

269
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.180
Seriously.
You know,
like if I said,
Hey Jocko,
you're in prison for,
I dunno,

270
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.120
whatever.
And you have eight hours of sleep for eight hours.

271
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.960
I don't know if I can do that.
Deployed on a ship multiple times,

272
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.500
three shipboard deployments as a seal.
And when you're a seal on a ship,

273
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:46.334
you have no job.

274
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.090
You don't like the guys that are the guys that are in the regular navy that are

275
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:54.260
driving the ship and maintaining this ship and steering the ship and all that.

276
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:58.940
They have a job.
We have no job,
eh.
And so what we could either sleep,

277
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.680
eat or Lyft and that's a race to say seal stood for sleep,

278
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.690
eat and lift.
But some guys would sleep a lot.

279
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.620
I wouldn't sleep a lot.
You get some guys that had to like sleep disorders.

280
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.800
There was a guy that slept for like 29 hours,

281
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.120
but they need to wake up and stay awake for 32 hours and then he'd go back to

282
00:17:20.121 --> 00:17:24.940
bed.
So yeah,
it was kind of weird.
His circadian rhythm was way off.
Yeah.

283
00:17:24.941 --> 00:17:28.250
And then that happens too on a ship because you can stay inside the ship with no

284
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:31.490
sun for forever if you want to.
We used to,

285
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:34.460
we used to go out as much as we could on the deck of the ship.
Yeah.

286
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.130
Get a Sun Tan,
do PT.
Sure that too.
But yeah,
I think you,

287
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.270
yeah,
you sleep different and you know,
some eight hour in,

288
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.860
actually I've done the thing where I got used to only getting like six,

289
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.860
six and a half and it,

290
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.610
<v 1>it started to work.
Like I said,
you know,
I didn't like that.</v>

291
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.310
I tried to go back to,
actually I only get six,
maybe seven though anyway.

292
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.810
Cause the kids thing anyway,
the Diet,
I think we'll,

293
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.550
I prefer real thing.
I believe this be a fact.

294
00:18:06.551 --> 00:18:09.900
75% or more solution to the whole problem.

295
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.390
The diet clean up the Diet is good when your lunch.
Yeah.

296
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.370
Stay away from the Mickey D's.
Yeah.
Stay away from all that stuff again man.

297
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.520
That's,
that is hard to consider it.

298
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:22.920
I mean I know it's hard to because you were tired.

299
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.830
It's a cycle that you started going down.
Yeah.

300
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.020
Because you were tired when he got home so you didn't make any food for the next

301
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.021
day.

302
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:31.020
So that means you brought something crappy or you bought fast food and now you

303
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:33.090
hate the fast food,
which makes you feel bad,
which means to get home.

304
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.860
You're tired from genes,
you don't make lunch for the next day,

305
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:36.210
which means you're only in this bad cycle.

306
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.020
And that's not to mention the pleasure part of it.
Cause like this hard work.

307
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:43.070
I need some relief from this hard work.
Work on my lunch break.

308
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.720
Dark chocolate.
Yeah.
Maybe bring some chocolate milk.

309
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.070
Yeah,
it tastes good and it's good for you.
Well are equally,

310
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:59.390
we'll say arguably it's not as bad for you as a mountain dew or a pizza by the

311
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:04.230
slice from the truck.
The food truck.
Yeah,
and that's usually what it is,
man.

312
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.120
Take it from me.
I know.
All right,
cool.
Next question.
That was one question.

313
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:12.600
We're 20 minutes deep.
Amen.
We got to get to the bottom of these things.

314
00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:15.340
I think that'll help though.
There will think so because look,
if you,

315
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.900
if let's say,
if you think,
oh yeah,
maybe I'll change my diet,
but you know what?

316
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.370
Okay,
I'll,
maybe I will.
Maybe I won't.

317
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:24.690
I'll just kind of focus on the workout part of it.
Yeah,
Bro.
You Bet.
Man.

318
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:26.850
One time I was like,
uh,
I didn't do any cardio.

319
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:28.530
I just kind of lifted and whatever.

320
00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:32.400
My Diet was not all that and Churros I was being strong.
I went to the doctor,

321
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:35.940
they said,
your your cholesterol,
our thing,
you know,
some stuff on the inside.

322
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:39.960
I was super unhealthy.
He was like,
you're unhealthy.
I'm about being in strong.

323
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:43.500
I was like,
wait sir,
but I can bench a lot.
I'm like,
Bro,
that doesn't matter.

324
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.180
So you can hang dry wall all day,
all day and Dang,
that's some good endurance.

325
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:53.040
If you can do that all day,
every day for 14 years,
by the way,
and be like,
oh,

326
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.420
I'll unhealthy because you ate wrong.

327
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.310
He had all Jameel that bat clean up the Diet.
Yeah,

328
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.700
it's good news is clean up the Diet pill situation.
Next question.
How do you,

329
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.950
how do you install pride back into an individual and ultimately a battalion?

330
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.600
I'm on my 17th 17th year serving in the British army.

331
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.350
I've been in my role for about a decade and I'm about to move on to different

332
00:20:16.351 --> 00:20:16.980
job.

333
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.870
Recently I've came out of my platoon bubble and notice there are numerous issues

334
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.190
I've identified and I'm looking to help my coc in fixing it.

335
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:28.703
All right,

336
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.150
so you want to instill pride back into a battalion,

337
00:20:33.151 --> 00:20:36.060
into a unit,
into an individual.
Uh,
in my opinion,

338
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.880
pride comes from hard work.
Pride comes from discipline.

339
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.600
Pride comes from performance,

340
00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:48.250
and pride comes from winning.

341
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.610
<v 0>And how do you win?
You win from hard work,</v>

342
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:59.500
you win from discipline,
so that's the cycle.
You work hard,

343
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.260
you stay disciplined.
That makes you start to perform.

344
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.900
That makes you start to win.
When you start to win,

345
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.240
you get pride and of course there's a dichotomy there too because you can work

346
00:21:10.241 --> 00:21:14.200
your guys too hard,
right?
You can do that so you have to balance it.

347
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.810
Then it's funny actually,
Leif was talking about this I think,

348
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.681
I don't know if it was a,

349
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:22.681
we were with a company and he was saying when we formed up task unit bruiser

350
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.440
we worked hard.
We worked a lot harder than normal tasking.
It's worked.

351
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.120
We stayed later at work.

352
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.840
We came in earlier and you know he was saying,
Hey,

353
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:39.430
when we first the first like month we were together and and jock was God,

354
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:43.060
everyone coming in early and all this stuff and people are grumbling about it

355
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:46.360
and why do we got to do this extra stuff and he's,
he's like,
yeah,

356
00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:47.540
there's people are grumbling about it.

357
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.830
But then once we started going through training in our performance was above our

358
00:21:55.961 --> 00:22:00.130
peers,
then all of a sudden it turned from grumbling to like pride.

359
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.880
So that's the,
then the guys,

360
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.110
they stopped complaining and they start bragging because you know what?

361
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:11.440
Where do you bruiser yeah,
of course you're not at work cause you're,

362
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:15.970
you're tasking you to is weak.
We are strong,
you are weak.
Get away from us.

363
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.030
We don't want to be associated with you.
So you start getting that,

364
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.870
which is pride.
So I think that's what you've gotta do.

365
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.960
You've got to instill the hard work,
the discipline in your team.

366
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.280
It will hurt a little bit at first.

367
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.610
You got to make sure you don't go overboard with it and that'll get you what you

368
00:22:30.611 --> 00:22:34.030
want.
If you need further references on that,

369
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:39.090
read a book called steal my soldier's heart by Colonel David Hackworth or read

370
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:43.000
about face by Colonel David Hackworth.
He talks about this,

371
00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:44.620
does he takes the takes battalion,

372
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:49.240
his battalion in Vietnam with no pride and turns them into people with a ton of

373
00:22:49.241 --> 00:22:51.700
pride.
How does he do it?
Makes them more card.

374
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.180
Makes them have disciplined and then they take pride in what they're doing.

375
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:02.320
Lead by example.
Yes.
Yes.
Anne Hackworth.

376
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.100
He doesn't change everything at once.
He hasn't come in and just go crazy.

377
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:10.390
He starts changing.
Important small things a couple of day,
Huh?

378
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.360
I think literally he says two a day.
We change two things a day.

379
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.990
But he did start off with a big thing.
If you remember this,

380
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.800
he checked in this battalion,
guys have radios,
guys have guitars,

381
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:28.300
guys have little bars set up.
They got all this crap and he goes,
hey,

382
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:31.900
everything that you can fit in a rucksack tomorrow morning in the middle of the

383
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.580
compound here and we're getting rid of it.

384
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.920
So that was a big wake up call for everyone.
But it was a,
it was a wakeup call.

385
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.840
And also it was,
why are we doing this?
What?

386
00:23:40.841 --> 00:23:44.380
We're doing this so that we can move when we move.
We won't get hit at night,

387
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.660
we'll get hit at night.
We won't lose anybody.
So

388
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.480
good stuff.

389
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.530
<v 2>Makes Sense.
Next question.</v>

390
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:58.210
Sorry for the English.
I'm French.
That's a disclaimer.
Hmm?

391
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:04.410
How can a man that has not grown up with the confidence and trust Ding male role

392
00:24:04.411 --> 00:24:09.360
models and mentors,
sort of anti uncle Jake persons only intellectual.

393
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.970
I'm saying this without districts or disrespect to these people.

394
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.430
How can they become a confident man and develop the necessary man skills,

395
00:24:17.431 --> 00:24:18.264
quote unquote.

396
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.670
<v 0>Okay.
It's interesting that you can say man skills in quotes.
Yeah.</v>

397
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.230
And I think we pretty much know what that means,
right?
Yes.

398
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.030
Like we know what that means.
So how do you do that?

399
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:36.830
You don't have any positive role model around you.
That's I can uncle Jake,

400
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.470
which by the way,
most people don't have an uncle Jake.
Yeah,
right.

401
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:43.790
That's not normal to have uncle Jake.
Most people you got what you got.

402
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.430
And in this case he's saying he's got like the intellectuals.
So you know,

403
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.270
my parents were college professors and they don't have any of these skills and

404
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:57.680
they sit around and talk about philosophy.
Right now I ended up,

405
00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.620
I can talk about philosophy.
Well,
but

406
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:07.270
I can't fix my car or I can't defend myself in a combat scenario in the streets.

407
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.300
So what are you gonna do?
Okay,
this is a real symbol.
Go do things.
Go do things.

408
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.390
Lift,
start lifting weights,
learn how to dead lift.
Learn how to squat.
Yeah,

409
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.920
that's a,
that's part about being a man,
right?
Sure.
Physically strong,

410
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.100
physically strong.
Learned some Jujitsu.
I recommend that.

411
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.760
Probably could have guessed that one.
Learning how to fight,

412
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.650
learning how to defend yourself.
I just got asked this the other day.

413
00:25:34.651 --> 00:25:35.600
A kid came up to me,
he's like,

414
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.020
what should I do if I get intimidated by other people and I or I don't know how

415
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:45.560
to react when people like get in my face and I said,
do you train Jiu Jitsu?
No.

416
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.000
Start trying to Jiu Jitsu,
but then what?
I'm going to find everyone.
No,
no,
no.

417
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.370
You don't have to because you already know you can beat him up right now.

418
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:54.710
If they attack you.
Yeah,
you can beat him up.

419
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.820
But if they are just getting in your face and try to punk you and you look at

420
00:25:58.821 --> 00:26:02.090
them and go pay,
if you want to do this,
let's do this,
but I don't care.

421
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.410
I know you can come to my gym,
I'll choke you out.
Trained some Jujitsu.

422
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:11.090
Uh,
so we got that one.
Run,
hike,

423
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.170
sprint,
climb,
build things,

424
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.890
start building things,
rewire things.

425
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:20.560
<v 3>Okay,</v>

426
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.850
<v 0>do some plumbing.
These things are not</v>

427
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.700
there.
They're not impossible to do.
Now it's going to take you longer.
Right?

428
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.280
Like I've rewired my parts of my house,

429
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.240
I've re plumbed parts of my house and done all the plumbing and parts of my

430
00:26:37.241 --> 00:26:40.870
house.
Now if you watch a skilled electrician do what I'm doing,

431
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.330
he would literally take him one eighth of the time,

432
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.010
maybe one quarter of the time because,

433
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.250
or like the dry wall or we were talking about earlier,
a good dry Waller.

434
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.870
They are like masters,
a good electrician,
masters,
a good plumber.

435
00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:00.150
They're smooth me.
It's going to take a while.
Sure.
So,
but,

436
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.280
but what I'm saying is it's not impossible.

437
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.910
It's not impossible to do and it'll take you more time,

438
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.420
but you're learning how to do it and that gives you,

439
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.700
what does that give you?
It gives you the self-reliance,
right?
Hey,

440
00:27:14.701 --> 00:27:18.400
I can fix my electrical outlet if I need to.

441
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.630
So those are good things that work on your car,
change your oil,
whatever,

442
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.990
do those things.
And again,
those things like I,

443
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.260
so I took electricity class in high school where we learned how to wire rooms

444
00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:36.750
and everything cause that what it's called,
it was called electricity class.

445
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.690
I took electricity with Scotty was the teacher's name.
Sure.
Wait,

446
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.720
you called him Scotty.
Everyone called him Scotty.
He was an older guy.

447
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.080
His name was Scotty.
We all called him Scotty Sweeney.
So Scotty,
but we,

448
00:27:50.081 --> 00:27:53.430
we learn how to walk wirehouses and all that.
Well,

449
00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:58.431
I didn't remember any of that when I was now 20 years later or 15 years later,

450
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:03.270
I'm a rewiring my kitchen where I,
which I ripped out of my house.
Okay.

451
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:05.820
So what did I do?
You know what I did?
Went down to home depot.

452
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:11.450
I bought a book called electrical wiring and I've read through it and I'd

453
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.580
followed the directions.
Same thing with plumbing.

454
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.300
Go down by a book called how to do plumbing and you do it and it,

455
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.480
and the,

456
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.680
the good thing about this stuff is it's very satisfying to do that kind of work.

457
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.400
It's very satisfying to do it.
And you can over engineer things,

458
00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:34.080
you make things super solid in your own house.
Super Secure.
Super.
Yeah.

459
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.350
You can just kind of go the extra distance cause it's your own,
your own house.

460
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.240
So that's cool.
Uh,

461
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.420
so those are all physical things and some kind of knowledge things that you can

462
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:43.254
start working on.

463
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.180
What all the hardest thing to overcome here is like a level of embarrassment.

464
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:53.100
Yeah.
Right.
Like,
uh,
I don't know anything about wiring.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You know,

465
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:53.490
I don't,

466
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.000
I'm embarrassed to say I don't know anything about wiring and so people don't

467
00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.590
want to say anything.
So they'd rather just say,
hey,

468
00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:01.710
let's get an electrician in here to figure this one out.
Or Hey,
I will just get,

469
00:29:01.711 --> 00:29:03.690
yeah.
So they're to too embarrassed.

470
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.840
But if you have time,

471
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.010
do it yourself and don't be embarrassed about it and be like,
Hey,
I'm more,

472
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:13.740
I'm rewiring my kitchen.
And I have no idea what I'm doing.
Give me this book,

473
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.030
what I need to get.
Oh,
give me some tools.
It's good to have good tools.

474
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:24.210
Uh,
also.
So that's,
that's like I said,
those are things that you can do,
you know,

475
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:29.220
um,
learning to shoot,
you know,
learn to shoot.
That's a good,
good skill to have.

476
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.820
Also read,
write,

477
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.270
read about history,

478
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.690
read about survival,
read about the world,

479
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.350
read about human beings under duress,
read,

480
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.760
read books,
good books about good stuff,

481
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.250
about challenges.
It's,
and then just like mark way,
the warrior kid,

482
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.040
he doesn't know his times tables.
He has to learn them.

483
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.170
You have to go learn all this stuff I'm talking about.
You have to go learn.

484
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.980
And with,
with time your confidence is going to grow.

485
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:10.260
And from humility you'll grow into being more confident.

486
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.970
Now you also say you don't have any mentors or role models around you.

487
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.230
That's okay cause those mentors,

488
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.630
mentors and role models are in books and you can find them.

489
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.980
I just talked about David Hackworth,
good mentor to have.

490
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.150
Imagine you can have a guy,

491
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:29.480
a guy wrote you a 1000 page book on how to lead and is for you.

492
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:36.810
That's pretty awesome.
Beyond Band of brothers,

493
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.570
by Dick Winters.
Guess what?

494
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.980
Here's a guy that was the in charge of

495
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.313
<v 3>the</v>

496
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.440
<v 0>band of brothers in Normandy and he wrote a book for you to learn how to lead.</v>

497
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:58.230
So those are some examples.
And like I said,

498
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.240
most of the books that we've covered on this bar,

499
00:31:00.241 --> 00:31:03.030
many of the books that we cover on this podcast and give you a mentor better

500
00:31:03.031 --> 00:31:07.380
than anyone could possibly hope for.
Yeah.
So you can get it there,
but,
and,

501
00:31:07.381 --> 00:31:08.700
and we mostly cover war books,

502
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:13.701
but there's books about all kinds of people that can be virtual mentors.

503
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.740
So read,
study,
Do,
do,

504
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.640
that's my advice on that one.
Yeah.
That physically strong thing is,
uh,

505
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.900
in my opinion,
a big deal because especially what with um,

506
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:29.790
you know,

507
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:34.560
<v 2>intellectual types and that kind of environment since that's not really a</v>

508
00:31:34.561 --> 00:31:37.930
priority,
a lot of the time
youth tend to,
you know,

509
00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:42.040
how like you're not into something,
so you kind of shun it as adults.

510
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.880
And I've seen this,
I'm not saying all the time,
but you know,

511
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.100
sometimes the don't take downs so I'm not going to do them.

512
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:52.210
And then you think of all the reasons why you don't need to do it and how guys

513
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:55.480
focused.
True.
You know,
or whatever.
So in intellectual circle,

514
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.260
we'll see those circles.
Sometimes he'd be like,
Oh yeah,

515
00:31:59.261 --> 00:32:02.050
those meatheads or whatever,
you know,
they just,
they'll shun it.

516
00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:06.940
You said about that issue
there?
Yeah,
maybe.
No,

517
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.900
I don't think so actually.
Yeah.

518
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:12.820
But they'll do that and then there'll be these for physically frail people,

519
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.690
but since they,
they're in their mind smarter than everyone,

520
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:18.420
they feel like that the one up in there kind of,

521
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.380
there's an element of satisfaction there.
Yeah.

522
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.593
<v 3>But</v>

523
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.820
<v 2>at the end of the day,
you're physically weak when it comes down to it.</v>

524
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.910
And I think most of the time I think,
I don't know.

525
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.700
But it seems like most of the time they'll have these feelings.

526
00:32:32.701 --> 00:32:36.600
Like this guy asked right here,
like,
yeah,
man,
how can I develop?

527
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.530
Because I feel it.

528
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.060
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Unless they just want to be in denial.
That's what exactly what,</v>

529
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:46.220
but when you're in also,
and by the way,
the same thing happens in the reverse,

530
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.630
right?
Yeah.
A guy that's just a meat head,

531
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.740
he shuns and and disrespects or disregards the intellectual side of things and

532
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:59.720
that is the,
that is equally as bad because they're not,

533
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.840
they don't know what's going on.
They're not knowledgeable,
they're not learning,

534
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:04.460
they don't understand the world in a clear way.

535
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:07.140
So find the balance between those two things.
Yeah.

536
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.460
What's great is those things are not mutually exclusive.

537
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.530
Like you don't have to just be a meathead or just have to be a book warm.

538
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:18.770
Right.
You can do both.
There's plenty of time in the day to do both.

539
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:23.060
Be a smart ass guy with a big dead lift.

540
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.890
That's a good thing.
I'm trying to be that guy.
Not there yet,

541
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.980
but I'm working on it.
Yeah.
And then that one level up,

542
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.780
which is the Jujitsu part of it.
You did nothing to you.

543
00:33:33.781 --> 00:33:38.210
I'm thinking about who combines the intellectual piece with the physical piece

544
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.020
and in a way you can kind of,
I would,
I'm not recommending this at all.

545
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:45.200
In fact I'm against this,
but this is the nature of Jujitsu.

546
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.730
You don't have to be that.

547
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.300
Like you don't have to have a big dead lifted two dominate in for sure.

548
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:51.530
Don't have to do any of that.

549
00:33:51.531 --> 00:33:54.860
So you can essentially overcome the physical part of it even though just the

550
00:33:54.861 --> 00:33:56.270
physical,
but it's a,
you don't have to,

551
00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.140
you're going to overcome the physical part of it for it to a point.
Yeah.

552
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.250
In everyday life.
I mean you,
you're trying to,
you're trying to be the fill guy.

553
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.520
Like if someone's better than you at Jujitsu training room,

554
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.030
it really bothers you or he's talking about everyone or are you just talking

555
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:15.040
about me?
It doesn't bother me.
Well,
let's say it motivates me.
I don't know.

556
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.640
Like it doesn't bother me.
I mean,
like for instance,

557
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.940
I trained with Dean lister all the time.
Yeah.
He's better at me in Jujitsu.
Right?

558
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:27.490
I every day want to train with them so it doesn't bother me.
Says,
not bothered,

559
00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:31.160
but like what an no compels you like,
you know,
well maybe it does.

560
00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:35.360
Like I hate it at the end of the day.
Depends on what you mean by a lot of them.

561
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.520
I hate it.
I do.
I hate it and I love it.

562
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.870
And we were just joking about the other day cause we got new little scrap

563
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.510
yesterday,
you know,

564
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:46.340
kind of end the training and all of a sudden things got escalated and there was

565
00:34:46.341 --> 00:34:50.970
some shouting going on and shouting,
shouting,
you know,

566
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.300
he was saying what he says and I was saying what I say and uh,

567
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.070
but we had a know we had a mutual truce at the end.

568
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.360
I think he didn't really want any more.
I didn't really want any more.

569
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:06.970
So we just Kinda said let's,
let's laugh and call it good cause you're,

570
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.600
you're rolling the dice.
When I'm rolling with Dean,
there's a,

571
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.950
there's a dice roll happening.
Cause if he ends up in a good position on me,

572
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.440
there's going to be paid.
There's going to be pain.

573
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.650
If I ended up a good position on him,
there's going to be paid.

574
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.150
So I think both of us,
we got away a little bit of an escape.

575
00:35:23.151 --> 00:35:25.910
Neither one of us got a really good position and we,

576
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.650
I got back up to my feet and I,

577
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.580
and then we both kind of just had a mutual agreement,

578
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.220
an unspoken agreement that we were done for the day

579
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.160
that happened.
But

580
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.130
<v 1>the point there being is in a host,
like in this weird way,</v>

581
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.610
you know how like intellectually you can excel so you can kind of find it

582
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:46.800
justifiable to avoid the physical part of it.

583
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.920
It's almost like you could almost say the same thing about Jujitsu.

584
00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:54.510
You could still be effective in defending yourself without be physically strong

585
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:57.900
necessarily.
But,
but my point is that there's a limitation to that.

586
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:03.360
Ultimately you can be,
you can be unbelievable at Jujitsu,

587
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.150
but if you're really,

588
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:08.550
really weak and you go against someone that's really good at Jujitsu,

589
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:10.230
but there are a hell of a lot stronger than you,

590
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.280
you're going to have some issues.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
And that goes for everything.

591
00:36:13.281 --> 00:36:15.270
You've got to be both.
Yeah.
I ideally,

592
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:19.680
and that's ultimately the main point is just like how intellectually you can be,

593
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:20.191
you know,

594
00:36:20.191 --> 00:36:24.630
a black belt and you can sorta in a way get away with not necessarily being this

595
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:26.850
as a way of holding people and vice versa.

596
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.700
And then do you do things like that third element you didn't sort of get away

597
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:32.160
with not being super strong but still be effective in Jujitsu.

598
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:36.810
You know what I mean?
So yeah,
ideally just,
yeah,
get,
get that balance.

599
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.220
But being able to defend yourself is a whole nother thing than being physically

600
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:45.000
strong at,
you know,
seems obvious.
But when you go through life,

601
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:48.120
I think it's not because you get these like big Jack guys and it's like no one

602
00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:50.400
wants to mess with him.
Well Bro,

603
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:54.540
this medium to small guy who knows Jujitsu or knows these,
you know,

604
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:59.430
for real fighting stuff is way more of a,
I don't want to say dangerous,
but yeah,

605
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:03.390
ultimately way more dangerous than this big jacked guy who can lift a lot for

606
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:06.930
sure.
So it's that third element that are kind of like weird when your role with

607
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:10.630
somebody that's super jacked and they don't know Jujitsu.
Yes.

608
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:15.600
It's amazing.
It was amazing.
Yeah.
You just think to yourself,

609
00:37:15.601 --> 00:37:19.390
how was this happening?
Yeah.
This is the magical power.
Yeah.

610
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.480
Because you looking at a big Jack Guy,

611
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.190
your human instincts tell you look out,

612
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:31.020
he's going to fat person is stronger than you,
you know,
watch out.

613
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.560
But when you know Jujitsu you don't,

614
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.550
and eventually you realize you don't even have that anymore.
Yeah.

615
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.940
You know everyone you're looking at thinking,
wait,
you don't have,

616
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.390
oh you don't have
the instinct of fear.

617
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.730
Although you're still you,
you know,

618
00:37:47.731 --> 00:37:50.940
my first thought when I look at someone was like,
do they train or not?
Yeah.

619
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.450
Do they train or not?
If they train we,
we may have issues.

620
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.120
This could be a problem if they don't train.
No factor.
No train,
no factor.
Yeah.

621
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.120
If they train may have a factor.
That's why I got to work out harder,

622
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.600
so I'm going to be strong.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
you know,

623
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.620
cause they might be coming to take my lunch money maybe.
Right.
I don't want that.

624
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:14.640
Oh,
how's this last night?
Literally last night.

625
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.800
Do you even train last night?
I did not train last.

626
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.290
This is a real world experience.

627
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.980
So you know the five gallon jugs of water,

628
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.020
you know those big when you put it in the water cooler or whatever.

629
00:38:25.021 --> 00:38:28.230
So there's like a little refilling thing that I went too late.
It was like,
no,

630
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.750
I've told this story before.
Now there's another,
this happened last night.

631
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.630
Hey soul hazardous duty know refilling it.
Yeah,
I know.

632
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:37.900
Okay.
I mentioned I do that.
Okay.

633
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.230
So last night when I was doing now was refilling the jugs.
Um,
you know,

634
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:41.651
I go in the store,

635
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:45.640
I'm coming out walking to my truck to get the empty jugs to go to the little

636
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:47.740
thing.
As I'm walking to my truck,

637
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:52.420
a car pulls up right next to the water feeling thing.
There's a,

638
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:56.160
what's called a red box.
You know what that is?
It's a DVD rental thing.
Yeah.

639
00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.330
So carpals up a kid,
maybe 12 years old,
jumps out of the car,

640
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.510
he starts like he's a normal kid,

641
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.570
whatever and from in the car,

642
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.180
this male probably is dead,

643
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.270
someone maybe Stepdad really.

644
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.960
And immediately the dad starts yelling at him like just put it in the thing.

645
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:24.400
And just to the point where I thought it was kind of joking where cause all joke

646
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:27.670
in my daughter like that he kind of like how you'll do sometimes.
Yeah,

647
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.770
you'll get in.
It sounded like a joke,
but I was like probably this guy's serious.

648
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.910
And the kid is like,
you could tell he was kind of used to it.
He was like,
I am,

649
00:39:36.911 --> 00:39:38.620
I'm doing,
I'm trying,
you know,
whatever,
whatever.

650
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.470
And that kind of the whole parking lot could here,

651
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.540
and this is at nighttime just to give you the setting.

652
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.400
So I'm walking to my truck,
I'm like,
Bro,

653
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:49.270
if I get to this place and this guy still there,
not even yelling,

654
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:52.330
I'm sitting there,
I'm going to have to say something,
not be a Dick,
not be like,

655
00:39:52.331 --> 00:39:57.070
hey,
like that,
I'm going to try to solve this problem and be like,
Hey,
this kid,

656
00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:57.611
you know,
whatever.

657
00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:01.780
I had this little thing before I knew Jujitsu or anything like that,

658
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:05.440
I wouldn't have messed with it.
I would even been like big or whatever,
and Shawn,

659
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.610
I would've been like,
aw man,

660
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:10.000
that's all I've ever known that guys got going on here.
Yeah.
You know?
But man,

661
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:13.210
I was like,
man,
I'm going to do this.
So I grabbed it and they left.

662
00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:15.160
So I didn't get the opportunity.
But I'm just saying,

663
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.330
these are things that can happen on varying levels every day.

664
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.260
And if you're an intellectual tech,
and I'm not saying if you're an intellectual,

665
00:40:23.261 --> 00:40:28.030
but if you don't have these elements of whether it be skill or knowledge or

666
00:40:28.031 --> 00:40:31.420
whatever,
like those things mess with you.
You know,
you're like,

667
00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.920
I can't get to.
And when I figured out what did you do was when master chief,

668
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:40.300
Steve Bailey choked me.
And he was,
he was an old man at the time,

669
00:40:40.301 --> 00:40:43.870
probably three years younger than I am.
And I was thinking to myself,

670
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:47.620
this is how this guy just do this to me.
That's insane.
That's completely insane.

671
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.680
I need to learn whatever he knows,
teach to me,
whatever,
you know,

672
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.660
cause I don't want to feel that way ever.
Bra.

673
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.570
And then you're training it like let's say you train for five years,

674
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.630
for five years,
your training,
not against people who don't know.

675
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.130
You're training against people who do not dangerous people who do know how to

676
00:41:03.131 --> 00:41:06.950
defend your shit and then you go in the real world.
Yeah.

677
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:11.200
You have this guy has no idea how much control you have over and you didn't even

678
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:15.200
touch it.
Yeah,
I see.
Yeah,
that's totally.
So again,

679
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.090
this whole thing where,
I mean you're in,
you're thing about,
um,

680
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.620
some guy with the guy was,

681
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.350
his problem was like when people get in his face or whatever,

682
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.150
his problem wasn't getting beat up.

683
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.090
It was when people get in your face and how you react and how you feel and
stuff,

684
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.840
but that feeling gone.
Yeah,
because you're right,
you're,
you're 100% right.

685
00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:34.280
Because he said he wasn't scared

686
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.640
<v 0>of fighting.
He was saying like I might get in trouble.
He was,</v>

687
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.260
he didn't like how we felt.

688
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.320
He felt like he should do something and he felt like a wimp basically.

689
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.040
When you know that you can destroy someone and then it doesn't matter,

690
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.800
you just think they're an idiot.
Yeah.
You beat them.

691
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.120
You get the strength and the skills and you actually beat them on an

692
00:41:53.121 --> 00:41:57.650
intellectual level,
so it's like a dance.
Double Gravitational.

693
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.520
All right.
If you can get those three and an intellectual,
psychological,
whatever,

694
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:08.210
mental,
physical and skill wise,
defending yourself,

695
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.360
probably that's three right there.
It's good stuff.

696
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:16.100
Not just how hard you want to hit it.
Really.
You want to hit it hard?

697
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.740
I think so too.
You know,
it's very beneficial to hit it hard.

698
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.010
<v 3>Next question,
Jocko.</v>

699
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:30.820
<v 0>Could someone always be detached?
Okay.
Straight forward question.</v>

700
00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:32.493
The answer is no.

701
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.020
Someone shouldn't always be detached because otherwise you aren't enjoying

702
00:42:38.021 --> 00:42:43.000
anything
in your life.
So don't always be attached,

703
00:42:43.001 --> 00:42:47.440
detached.
No.
But at the same time that being shared,

704
00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.460
you should be all aware all the time.

705
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.110
If you are getting sucked into the emotional vortex,
right.

706
00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.590
You've gotta be aware of that.
Once you have that awareness,

707
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.530
you don't need to be attached all the time at all.
Yeah,
you can.

708
00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.250
I'm not always detached at all,
but,

709
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:11.730
but I've got clear warning signs when things start going sideways and I started

710
00:43:14.891 --> 00:43:19.390
going down some vortex.
I know immediately and I just detach.
So it's really easy.

711
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.160
It's,
but it's,
it does take practice and eventually you realize that you know,

712
00:43:24.161 --> 00:43:25.240
when you're feeling overwhelmed,

713
00:43:25.241 --> 00:43:27.850
when you're feeling emotional and you're feeling angry or you're feeling

714
00:43:27.851 --> 00:43:28.684
frustrated,

715
00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:32.380
when you start feeling those things and you've sent them really quickly and you

716
00:43:32.381 --> 00:43:35.800
recognize them,
you just attach,
boom,
you're done.

717
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.620
So that's what you gotta do.

718
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.440
Start recognizing those red flags so that you can enjoy the good things.

719
00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.640
And when something starts getting crazy,
you can detach.
Yes.

720
00:43:45.641 --> 00:43:50.641
So it's like an overall skill of being able to control when to detach and when

721
00:43:51.341 --> 00:43:52.150
you don't have to.

722
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:56.950
Being able to identify when you need to detach,

723
00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:00.550
then being able to detach then you're good.
Yeah.

724
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.600
So it's like it's a matter of being capable of making an accurate,

725
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:08.800
beneficial choice.
Yeah.
The identification is the hard part.

726
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:13.390
What happens to people when they talk to me is they go the after the fact they

727
00:44:13.391 --> 00:44:16.240
realized I lost my temper and I did this.
Okay.

728
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:20.120
You didn't detach it in time and that's why you ended up there.
So,

729
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.900
or I said some things to my,
you know,

730
00:44:22.901 --> 00:44:26.470
my ex girlfriend that I shouldn't have said because I got too emotional.
Exactly.

731
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.980
You didn't detach and tongue,
you got crazy and emotional.

732
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.260
So the skill that you're missing is identifying when you're starting to get too

733
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:38.950
emotional,
whatever that emotion might be.
Once you identify it,
boom.
Detach.
Yeah.

734
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:43.680
It's kind of like control.
Then you can take control.
Yes.
And make tactical moves,

735
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.830
not emotional moves.
Ultimately that the art,
you know,
to make the move.

736
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.790
You know how like did you two guys be,
if they never take anything?
No.

737
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:53.630
You know what,
the moves,
when you're emotionally detached,

738
00:44:53.631 --> 00:44:56.760
the moves actually aren't that hard.
They're actually usually pretty obvious.

739
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:01.530
Like you're,
you're in a fight with your girlfriend and,

740
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.980
and you're starting to go down the wrong lane.
As soon as you did that,
you go,
oh,

741
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:05.814
I know what I need to do.

742
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.150
I should say I'm sorry and tell her that we can go to the restaurant that she

743
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:11.660
wants to go to or whatever.
You know what I mean?
The,
the,

744
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.260
the moves are not actually that hard,

745
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:16.320
but we never make good moves when we're being emotional.
Instead we just go,
no,

746
00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:18.210
I don't want to go to that restaurant.
We went there three weeks duel.

747
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.600
I don't care if I'd said that to you.
You deserve me to say that to you.
Yeah,

748
00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:24.750
yeah,
yeah.
That you go down the wrong path.

749
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.540
But what if somebody like detached the whole time,

750
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:30.660
even when problems don't arise like that and then we don't have a relationship.

751
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.270
Right.
That's what I mean.
That's,
yeah,
that's what I'm saying.
So it's sort of,

752
00:45:33.271 --> 00:45:34.680
you're not being to detach fault all the time.

753
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:36.390
That's what I got to the answer to the question.
Right.

754
00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:39.420
So it's like you've reiterated it for everyone.
Yeah,
man.

755
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:42.990
That's what I'm here for.
I think a lot of times,
you know what guys will ask you,

756
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:46.140
Hey,
I want to learn to get to,
I want to learn to mess people up.
I think bro,

757
00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:48.240
that's not really what it is.
Did you get to,

758
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:51.660
is having the skills to quote unquote mess people up.

759
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:57.020
But what you learn ultimately is you put yourself in a position where you can

760
00:45:57.091 --> 00:46:00.070
make that decision.
Is it time to mess someone up or not?
You know,

761
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.000
and you just have control.

762
00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.250
So that's really what most people that start with the vision of,

763
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:09.300
I want to build a mess people up.
Most people continued that,

764
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:11.340
that do continue on the journey of Jujitsu,

765
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.730
arrive at a point where they realize that they don't want to abuse this power

766
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:16.880
that they now have.
Yeah.
Most people,
yeah,

767
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:19.800
there's a small percentage of people that don't,
that are bullies.

768
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.070
They were bullies when they started and they become more effective.
Bullies.

769
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:28.680
More fearful,
more,
more fear in posing beliefs.

770
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:31.860
Yeah.
Which sucks.
But Jujitsu is power.

771
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.230
That's where you're going to have some of it.
Yeah,
I agree.

772
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:35.640
But compare it to like a,

773
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.980
I dunno anything where it's like striking based or whatever.
It's like you,

774
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.790
like I've said this for,
I'm not going to go deep in it,

775
00:46:41.791 --> 00:46:46.370
but you go from zero to 10 when you throw a strike that's already at 10 know.

776
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.290
You can't just throw a light one and be like,
okay,
are we going now?
You know,

777
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:51.750
kind of thing goes.
They're not cool.
Nope.
You slap me in the face.

778
00:46:51.751 --> 00:46:54.450
We ain't cool at all.
He brought it to 10 where the duct amount of nuts.

779
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.880
It's funny because like I see,

780
00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:00.000
I see my kids and,

781
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:03.810
and what you're talking about can happen very easily when other people are in

782
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:07.200
the group.
With my kids,
I mean because they've been training Jujitsu,

783
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:12.090
so even like against any normal kid,

784
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:14.940
there's no factor.
Yeah.

785
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:17.700
Like I see me to my song will be wrestling around with some kid has no factor.

786
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:22.620
Yeah.
And it's,
you know,
it's kind of cool.
Kind of cool.
It's real cool.

787
00:47:22.621 --> 00:47:25.730
Yeah.
You know,
my kids aren't like Jujitsu,

788
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:29.350
like there's kids out there that are sick,
competitive Jujitsu all the time.
Yeah.

789
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.060
Right.
Huh.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Like just knowing Jujitsu

790
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:36.190
<v 2>a hundred percent correct.
Yes.</v>

791
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.460
And but when I see kids doing Jujitsu specially like,

792
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:43.230
I'm not saying it's necessarily even in a tournament,
I'm just saying in Jujitsu,

793
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.210
in class,
even at the beach or whatever.
When I see him,
I'm like,
man,

794
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:49.360
I wish I could have done Jujitsu when I was a little kid.

795
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:54.450
You don't find that would be men.
Make up for it now.
Try it.

796
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:57.370
Next question.
Jocko.

797
00:47:57.371 --> 00:48:01.600
I'd been offered a job as a deputy sheriff of a few months before the position

798
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:02.590
is actually open.

799
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:07.890
I really want slash need to get into some Jujitsu due to the nature of the job.

800
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.190
The closest place to me is over an hour.
Drive away.
Yeah.

801
00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:16.810
Harshel finances are an issue when it comes to that kind of drive plus fees to

802
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:21.490
attend.
My main question is how do you feel about Gracie's online school?

803
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.450
That's an option.
If I were to find others who want to learn,

804
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:27.340
would this be effective?

805
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.250
<v 0>Uh,
yes.
So here's what you need to do.
Get some mats.</v>

806
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:36.160
You can make mats,
you can get,

807
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:41.161
you can get a piece of canvas from home depot or a piece of vinyl and string it

808
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:44.920
between trees on the ground.
You just have mats.

809
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.400
You just made them all over grass.
That works.
I've done it.

810
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:51.370
I've trained on,

811
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:56.110
there's a truck called a six by in the military.
It's a big giant,

812
00:48:56.111 --> 00:49:00.310
like a truck.
And it has,
you've seen,
this isn't like your typical war movie.

813
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:02.710
The truck with the canvas tarp over the back.
Rambo.

814
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.540
I've taken that thing off and that was my mat on top of the truck.
No,
no,
no.

815
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:10.210
Taking it off the top of the tree.
You took the canvas and that canvas,

816
00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:13.150
I'll put it on the ground.
Guess what I got now?
Jujitsu,
Matt.

817
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:17.380
Strong wooden stakes in the ground.
We're going to go to canvas,

818
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:22.370
but it's good to go.
So you do that.
Then you get on youtube,
you know,

819
00:49:22.371 --> 00:49:27.190
Youtube,
you know Gracie Academy,
uh,
Marcello Garcia online.

820
00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:29.290
Those are really good.
I would actually start with youtube,

821
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:32.140
just like get some basics down and get some fundamentals get you'd need two,

822
00:49:32.141 --> 00:49:36.610
three,
four friends.
If you got a friend that wrestled,
get him in there.

823
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.570
If you got a friend that did judo,
get him in there.
Um,

824
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:44.950
and then you just start looking at the moves and fighting each other and trying

825
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:46.910
to see what works and don't go nuts on each other.

826
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.630
Trying to figure out what works,
what doesn't work,
learn the basic concepts.

827
00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.980
And then maybe Saturdays,

828
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:56.440
maybe every other Saturday,
maybe one Saturday a month,

829
00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.100
you drive an hour to the school with your buddies.
You go in there,
you say,

830
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:04.210
hey man,
we live up in wherever,
an hour away from here.
If we give you 10 bucks,

831
00:50:04.211 --> 00:50:08.170
can we get on the mat?
You know,
this weekend just for just for a couple hours,

832
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.470
can you,
can you look at what we're doing?
Maybe even say,
Hey,
look,

833
00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:14.800
in the four of us,
get a private,
we'll all give you 20 bucks.
That's 80 bucks.

834
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:16.330
You can make an an hour coach,
please.

835
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.740
So then you get some detailed training and that's going to give you a base.

836
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.390
You know,
that's I think your best option.

837
00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:27.590
<v 2>Yeah.
Fully these,
um,
online,
uh,
you know,</v>

838
00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:28.160
academies

839
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.110
<v 1>and stuff,
that's essentially what they're made for.</v>

840
00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:34.130
If you can't make it out of me,
you go to the academy.
Yeah,

841
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:38.870
yeah,
yeah.
And I think podcast number six,

842
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.320
we talk about what to look for in a Jujitsu Academy.
Yeah.

843
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.060
So go back to podcast number six.

844
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:46.310
If you're starting Jujitsu and you want to find a good academy,

845
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:51.030
go back to podcast number six.
Yeah,
it's in there.
Yeah,
fully in,

846
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.730
I think to start,
especially if you don't know,
do you do through it all?
I like,

847
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:58.040
I think a lot of us started,
you did too with watching UFC one,
two,
three,
four,

848
00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:01.190
you know,
so we kind of,
after watching that,
we kind of see,
okay,

849
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:06.740
I see if your mount,
if you have mount,
that's good.
If you're on the bottom card,

850
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.880
if you,
you know,
so you got to pick up.
I didn't,
I knew what Jujitsu was,

851
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.110
so I didn't get to experience trying to learn the basic moves from seeing owner

852
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:15.500
UFC.

853
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.500
So I'm taking what you're telling me as factual and it makes some sense.

854
00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:26.141
But so did you actually like compute that the positions you were like okay

855
00:51:26.841 --> 00:51:29.150
that's the guards.
So you must have watched in detail.

856
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.820
He wants to watch where you might be like,
okay that Guy Hoists Gracie,

857
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:34.400
that guy that's wearing that white thing,
that white uniform,

858
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.410
look what he's doing.
He's got his legs closed run like I,

859
00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:38.030
that's where you guys were doing essentially.

860
00:51:38.031 --> 00:51:41.300
But cause even the announcers weren't calling it guard back then where they uh,

861
00:51:41.301 --> 00:51:45.980
yes,
there was a guy who was real nerdy guy and he was those Yossi too.

862
00:51:45.981 --> 00:51:48.970
I want to say maybe even what,
I forget which one was which.
But yeah,
he,

863
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.660
he knew and you could tell he was like kind of prideful that would train with

864
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:53.900
and whatever.
But if you've got,

865
00:51:53.901 --> 00:51:56.150
so you know how he's going to pull them in between his guard,

866
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.050
but he knew and he go,
well,
okay,
he's going to mount.

867
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.780
And it was real repetitive because he'd do the same thing.
So yeah,
you,

868
00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:05.040
you essentially,
if you're paying attention,
you learn guard.

869
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:09.500
You don't learn how to do an Armbar.
How did you know?
Well,
when I teach kids,

870
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:12.110
sometimes I'll just say,
you want for like,

871
00:52:12.111 --> 00:52:13.970
let's say a kid has been training for a day.

872
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:17.930
So first day you want to keep your legs around them,
right?
Yeah.
That's guard.

873
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.240
They don't even know what they're doing.
And then you say the other kid,

874
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.930
you want to get away from there or get around their legs.
Yeah.

875
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:27.320
And so they just try and do it.
And that's a pretty cool way to start things off.

876
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:32.060
Very.
You'd be surprised at what kids will instinctively do to make things happen

877
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:36.080
there.
And you,
even at the muster,
you know how you explain it just real quick.

878
00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.480
Like you're okay,
this is amount is why it's important.
This guard,

879
00:52:38.481 --> 00:52:42.100
that's why it's important.
That's really like the other day,
um,

880
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.810
ad there was a new girl in there.
Her name's Sarah.

881
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.560
I remember that cause I know someone else named Sarah.
But anyway,
uh,

882
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.360
Adam,
it was time to roll round team and say,
hey there.
Adam was like,
hey,

883
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:58.160
you know,
there's some new people here.
Smash,
no days,
zero days,
whatever.

884
00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:02.450
Um,
experience,
can you,
I dunno,
teach or something,
you know,
as a rounds are on,

885
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:05.100
cause I didn't have a partner at the time,
came in late or whatever.

886
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.110
But so I went and I did essentially that just sort of crash course.

887
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:13.800
This is mount,
this is guard,
this is a side mouth,
you know,

888
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.160
and this is the importance of each one.

889
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.570
And then this is literally takes five minutes.
So let me,

890
00:53:20.571 --> 00:53:23.270
here's the importance of everyone.
And then I do a little quiz at the end.
I said,

891
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:26.340
okay,
boom,
boom,
we fight.
It's like half speed.
We fight,
boom,

892
00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:28.260
we fall to the ground.
Where do you want to be in the,
you know,

893
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:30.240
so it's like a little quiz and boom right there,

894
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:34.560
that five minutes you learn everything that I learned from watching UFC one,
two,

895
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.120
three but two,
we're studying them and you were trying to figure it out.
But yeah,

896
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:41.850
you can learn it in five minutes from somebody shown it here.
Exactly right.

897
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.990
If that's what they're teaching you.

898
00:53:42.991 --> 00:53:46.740
A lot of times people will go in on their first day and some,
some academies,

899
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:49.160
they're dope.
They'll have an introductory class class.

900
00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:51.930
It was just kind of have that,
it's called introductory class.
But if you're like,

901
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:53.580
hey,
this is my first day,
let me see what I can learn.

902
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:56.100
Then they'll learn like some,
um,
you know,

903
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:58.410
almost plot or something and they're like,
wait,
whoa.

904
00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:01.380
I don't know how this even make sense to me,
you know,

905
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.800
but if you learn that crash course,
um,
or you know,
even going to muster,

906
00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:08.160
that's why it's so cool.
You,
you go over that and I was like,
Dang,
this is cool.

907
00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:10.860
You can leave that and now you're way better off.

908
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.190
Everyone has heard us talk about Jujitsu,

909
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.320
so they have this anticipation of it being really cool and then when they

910
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:22.290
connect the dots between like,
okay,

911
00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.420
you learn the mount and then you learn the guard and then you learn the sit up

912
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:29.850
sweep and when you done with the setup sweep here,
you're from the guard,

913
00:54:29.851 --> 00:54:33.080
you're back in the mountain and people were like it.
It's a miracle.

914
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.750
It's a miracle man testers,
the magic,

915
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.980
you know it and it's essentially before the actual moves,

916
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.340
like doing the moves.
It's just you have to know what's important and what's not.

917
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.470
Like if you mount on someone just by happenstance,

918
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:48.000
you don't know what mountain is or the importance of pump,

919
00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:50.310
but if you wind up on the mound,
you're trying to punch the guy.

920
00:54:50.311 --> 00:54:52.640
I'm saying in a fight you're trying to punch the guy and try and do damage.

921
00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:53.490
Trying to win the fight,

922
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.630
but punching the guy is not what you should be focused on.
Primarily.

923
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.540
It should be keeping the mind the position.
Exactly right,

924
00:55:00.541 --> 00:55:02.470
but no one's going to automatically know that that's not,
you know,

925
00:55:02.471 --> 00:55:05.160
you're trying to beat up the guy.
I'm on top.
I can punch him,
let me punch them.

926
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.440
But no,
it's just one of the many examples.
Next question.

927
00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:13.323
Jocko.

928
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:18.990
My boss is incredibly controlling an eagle maniacal.

929
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.580
I like him already.
EGOMANIAC.

930
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:26.403
I have,

931
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:30.480
I have attempted to use extreme ownership in dealing with the people under me,

932
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:34.740
but my boss has reprimanded me for leading.
He has said he gets,

933
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:39.150
he gets to do all the leading because he's the one in charge,
quote unquote and,

934
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:43.740
and his job title is higher than mine.
I've had that happen to me before.

935
00:55:43.741 --> 00:55:46.590
By the way,
if I could continue to try to lead,

936
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:51.840
my responsibilities will be taken away.
If I stepped back into the shadows,

937
00:55:51.841 --> 00:55:54.450
I won't make an impact on the people under me.
What should I do?

938
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.800
So it's black and white.
Yeah.
Right.

939
00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:01.830
And his mind seems that either step up and lead and get fired or step in the

940
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:08.940
shadows and do nothing and everyone will suffer.
It's not,
it's not that way.

941
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:10.080
Right?
It's not.
It's not black.

942
00:56:10.081 --> 00:56:14.520
And White and actually start by putting your own ego in check because you're

943
00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:19.140
calling someone at ego maniacal,
but you're,
your ego is being,

944
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:23.650
being touched a little bit here,
rubbed the wrong way a little because

945
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.220
<v 0>you want to lead.
And when you get told don't lead,
you get paid and offends you.</v>

946
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.070
Guess what?
That is your heat.
That's your ego.

947
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:35.400
So what you need to do is maybe you like the,

948
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.050
you like the feeling of being in charge.
That's cool.

949
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:40.780
I liked the feeling of being charged.
It's,
it feels good to me.

950
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:43.330
It feels normal to me when I'm not in charge.
I don't like it.

951
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:46.720
I have to consciously suppress it,
which is fine.

952
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.440
Sometimes you have to do that like right in this situation here that this guy is

953
00:56:50.441 --> 00:56:51.274
talking about.

954
00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:56.610
And what you need to suppress is you need to not be so overt with your

955
00:56:58.241 --> 00:57:01.480
leadership.
He shouldn't even be able to sense that you're leading,

956
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:05.680
but you should be leading.
You gotta be under the radar.

957
00:57:05.681 --> 00:57:08.070
You gotta be covert with what you're doing.
And by the way,

958
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.360
while you're doing that,
you're massaging homeboys,
ego.

959
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.500
Make him feel good about it,
making them feel that he is running things

960
00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:16.691
and because,

961
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:21.691
because you can absolutely lead from the shadows if your ego allows it.

962
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:26.530
Because a lot of times when we want,
when we lead,

963
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.940
we want everyone to know that would lead him.

964
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:32.860
I want everyone to know that I'm in charge.
I don't want them to know that.
Right.

965
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:37.090
That's really hard when you're leading from the shadows,
a lot of times,

966
00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:42.091
not even the people that you're leading recognize overtly that you're leading.

967
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:44.523
Think about that.

968
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:48.160
So the people that are actually following you don't even know that they're

969
00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:51.130
following you.
They don't.
They don't consciously know it.

970
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:54.460
Maybe if they were to break down and you give,
gave him like,
Hey,

971
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:56.490
who do you think has actually given you instruct vehicle?
Well,

972
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.800
I think that might be probably,
that seems like it's echo.
Okay.
Okay.

973
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:04.390
But they don't like consciously think about it.
So that's what you need to do.

974
00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:07.720
You need to suppress your overt leadership.

975
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:09.910
Not Step on the boss's toes.

976
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:12.760
Massages leader who would massage his ego a little bit.

977
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.800
Because if you do get your response,
do you want to help?
Right?

978
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.520
You want to be helpful.
You want to lead these people in a great way.

979
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:22.330
If you don't,
if you get your responsibilities taken away or you get fired,

980
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:25.510
then you can't help anyone,
anybody.
You're not gonna help the team at all.

981
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:30.840
So you have to be smart and you have to play the game to win his confidence and

982
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:33.880
his trust.
So he does let you lead.

983
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:37.060
And what's going to do that when he realizes that you're going to not going to

984
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:37.751
step on his toes,

985
00:58:37.751 --> 00:58:40.300
that you're going to give him the credit because he wants a credit.

986
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.370
He's an EGOMANIAC,
right?
He's controlling.

987
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:48.310
So that's kind of what you need to do.

988
00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:50.890
Now,
this is the weird thing and this came up at the muster.

989
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:54.520
People don't want to hear me say that.

990
00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:59.380
People don't want to hear me say that.
People don't want to hear me say that.

991
00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:04.090
If I come up against a boss,
the big ego,
what you need to do is back down.

992
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:07.960
People don't want to hear me say that.
They say they want to hear me.

993
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:10.870
Say if you come up against someone with a big ego,

994
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:15.790
what you do is you go up to them and you show them that they ain't got nothing

995
00:59:15.791 --> 00:59:17.290
on you.
Yeah,
don't back down.

996
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:21.000
Don't back down to that guy with a big ego that's weak.
You'll it's,

997
00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.800
and what I said at the monster and I said,
I said,
listen,
because I could see it.

998
00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.110
Yeah,
I could see it.
People are like,
oh,

999
00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.710
the youngest Jocko isn't always as hardcore as I thought he was because he's

1000
00:59:30.711 --> 00:59:34.550
going to back down to somebody with a big ego.
And I said,
guess what people,

1001
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:36.350
this is why you feel that way.

1002
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:43.150
If there was a a machine gun nest on a hill and there was a bad guy in there and

1003
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:47.810
he's killing a bunch of people shooting that machine gun and everyone in the

1004
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:52.490
room wants to look at Jocko and say,
Jack was brave and jock was tough,

1005
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:56.930
and Jock,
who's going to charge that machine gun nest and take that guy out?

1006
00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.473
Well guess what?

1007
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:05.570
A machine gun belt fed weapon in an elevated position.
Bunkered in.

1008
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.900
I'm not going to take that guy out.
I can't,

1009
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.860
it's a heavily defended position.
I can't do that.

1010
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.910
So what Jocko does his backs down.

1011
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:21.320
I hide it.
I get behind cover so I don't die

1012
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:26.900
once I've gotten behind cover so I don't die.
I look at echo and I say,
echo,

1013
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.100
stay here.
Shoot some rounds at this guy.
Occasionally distract him.

1014
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:37.250
I'm going to flank him.
So that goes going to keep under cover himself.

1015
01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:39.530
He's going to playing some rounds up with a machine gun nest.

1016
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.650
While he's doing that,
I'm going to scurry away like a little baby,

1017
01:00:42.651 --> 01:00:44.120
like little sneaky little squirrel.

1018
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.710
And I'm going to go round to the flank cause the machine gun isn't a bunker,

1019
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.330
right?
So we can't see out the sides.
Um,
and coming up the side,

1020
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:57.830
I'm going to get right to the assignment to toss a grenade in there and kill
him.

1021
01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:02.190
I'm going to take out the ego,
but I didn't do it.
Go and head on.
Yeah.

1022
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.780
So what happens is people come and go up against this big ego and they want to

1023
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:11.210
be the hero and they want to be aggressive when they want to default aggressive

1024
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.050
Jocko,
you say,
be you.
You got a chapter in your book,
default aggressive,
man.

1025
01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:19.010
I'm going to be default aggressive against that ego.
Wrong answer.

1026
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.360
The right answer is indirect warfare.
The right answers,
maneuver warfare,

1027
01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:27.170
the right answers.
You flank these people,
and by the way,

1028
01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.040
if I do charge that machine gun nest or I do attack that guy's ego,
guess what?

1029
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:33.470
I die or I get fired and now I'm no good to anybody.

1030
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.400
So it's people have this desire to be the strong hero and you have to fight

1031
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:46.220
that.
That's your ego.
That's my ego charging the machine gun nest.

1032
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.150
I'm going to go do this on the man.
No,
I'm actually not the man.

1033
01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:53.630
It's a machine gun.
No position.
I'm going to die.
You have to be smart.

1034
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:57.590
Yeah,
like Glenn,
go attack that you go head on.

1035
01:01:57.591 --> 01:02:00.590
Don't attack heavily defended positions head on.
Period.

1036
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.570
Like you sit in training day,
your voice,
a movie training day.
No,
come on Ray,

1037
01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:09.950
you've watched it anyway.
He says,
the Shit is chess,
not checkers.

1038
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:14.840
He's not the first person that ever said,
but it was dealt when he said it.

1039
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:17.180
In my opinion.
Nonetheless,
yes.

1040
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:20.490
Default aggressive isn't default aggressive

1041
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.300
<v 2>it to head.
It's default.
Default aggressive in being effective.</v>

1042
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:27.440
<v 0>Yes.
Yes.
Really.
You're effective or ineffective.</v>

1043
01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:30.220
The end of the day muster up being,
you know,
I listen.

1044
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:34.640
Lafe knows what he's talking about it like that.
Yeah,
man,
it's good.

1045
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:37.543
Jocko

1046
01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:39.980
<v 2>question.
Yes.
Okay.</v>

1047
01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:45.370
How do you shift your mindset from individual contributor to manager growing a

1048
01:02:45.371 --> 01:02:48.820
company from nothing to something required being an individual contributor in

1049
01:02:48.821 --> 01:02:52.840
getting a lot done with a little,
but as we grow,

1050
01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.310
it's clear that I need to hire people for specific roles and except the,

1051
01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.260
except that I can't do everything.

1052
01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.770
I'm very used to getting stuff done and doing everything myself and it feels a

1053
01:03:02.771 --> 01:03:04.690
little weird trusting someone else to do it.

1054
01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:08.410
How can I shift my mindset to appreciate being a manager over an individual

1055
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.513
contributor?

1056
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.800
<v 0>So,
uh,
straight up out of the gate,</v>

1057
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:18.330
you are actually failing as a leader by doing what you're doing,

1058
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.950
but by Dubai,
by continuing to do things yourself,

1059
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.840
get in the weeds and not let people lead.

1060
01:03:24.841 --> 01:03:27.660
You're actually failing as a leader and therefore failing the team.

1061
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.730
So number one,
you have to watch out for that.

1062
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.790
And you know,
by the way,

1063
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:40.850
that means the more time that you spend in the weeds getting stuffed on yourself

1064
01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:42.180
because you're so perfect.

1065
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.130
That's the last time that you're thinking about strategy.

1066
01:03:44.131 --> 01:03:45.900
That's the last time that you're thinking about,
you know,

1067
01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:48.060
what's going to happen tomorrow in future operations.

1068
01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:53.061
And that's not good to be in that situation.

1069
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.190
So,
uh,
first of all,
you need to build the trust with these people.

1070
01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:03.090
You don't have to give 100% trust to someone out of the gate.
If,
if I,

1071
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:07.410
if we were in a company and I hire you and I'm going to have you doing some
task,

1072
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.650
that doesn't mean I say,
Hey,
echo,
here's the task.
Go do it.

1073
01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:13.800
And now I'm just going to walk away.
I don't even know you.

1074
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:17.820
I don't know how well you can do the task,
so I'm going to say,
Hey,
echo,

1075
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:21.300
here's the task.
Actually watch me do it.
Okay,

1076
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:25.050
you've seen me do it now I'm going to watch you do it.
Okay,
cool.

1077
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:26.520
You seem to be doing that pretty well.

1078
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.760
I'm going to come check on you in two hours.
See how it's going?

1079
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.240
Come back two hours.
Next day I check you once every five hours.

1080
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.880
Next day I check you in the morning.
I check he wants in the afternoon.

1081
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:40.410
Next day I just check you at lunchtime.
Maybe two,
three,
four days later.

1082
01:04:40.411 --> 01:04:43.800
I check you once every other day.
Pretty soon you're good to go.

1083
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.140
And guess what I'm doing?
I'm doing something else.

1084
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:48.840
Doing something that I should be doing.
I built the trust.

1085
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.700
I confirm that you know how to do it.

1086
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.600
I you trust me because now I trust you were building some team and some

1087
01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:58.320
relationship,
so that's all good.

1088
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:02.460
So to the original point though,

1089
01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:06.870
I think the way that you shift your mindset is to recognize that micromanagement

1090
01:05:06.871 --> 01:05:10.560
is actually failure.
No progress is made while you're micromanaging.

1091
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.290
The longer you are micromanaging someone,

1092
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:17.710
the longer it takes for them to develop as a human being and as a useful person

1093
01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:18.580
in your organization.

1094
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:23.140
<v 1>Every minute that you micromanage someone is a minute of them.</v>

1095
01:05:23.141 --> 01:05:26.500
Not Thinking for themselves is a minute for them not taking ownership of

1096
01:05:26.501 --> 01:05:28.780
something.
Because if I'm micromanaging your task,

1097
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:31.210
you're not taking ownership of it.
If you're not taking ownership of it,

1098
01:05:31.211 --> 01:05:34.780
we know where that leads.
So

1099
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.100
let people learn.
Let people lead and to not do that is failing.

1100
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.060
Don't fail.
One time one Otl in Hawaii,

1101
01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:49.960
you get your driver's license at 15 Dang,
I dunno know what it is now.

1102
01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:50.794
That was long time ago,

1103
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:56.290
but I learned to drive with my dad before that.
You know,
when we're young,

1104
01:05:56.291 --> 01:06:00.100
we get quite as dirt roads everywhere,
so he's like,
hey,
you know,

1105
01:06:00.101 --> 01:06:05.020
and it started with when we were young,
when were young,
young,
like seven,

1106
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:06.730
eight years old.
We'd sit on his lap,

1107
01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.720
so he'd do the shifting in the gas and the brake and stuff like that.
Dirt roads,

1108
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.150
we just do the steering.
That's what it kind of started with.

1109
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:17.900
Then after a while he's like,
okay,
now we're just going to learn how to do this.

1110
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:21.160
You know,
it was a manual stick shift.
So he was like,
okay,

1111
01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.120
now you just learn how to go right in.

1112
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:28.450
Now it's go and shift gears and all on the dirt road,
whatever.
And so what else?

1113
01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:33.110
Like fifth just turned 15 or maybe even 14 and he was like,
Hey,
um,

1114
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.820
he's like,
all right,
let's go drive.
You know?

1115
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:38.230
Usually it'd be like we were going to the beach,
so on the way home,
hey,

1116
01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:40.150
let's take this dirt road.
You can steer kind of thing.

1117
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.870
But this was actually like,
okay,
let's go drive.
So I'm like,
all right,
bye.

1118
01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:47.020
He popped,
he plops me in the front seat and he goes,
all right,
take us there.

1119
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.390
And we were going wherever we were going down to the beach.
It's like,
all right,

1120
01:06:49.391 --> 01:06:53.100
take us there.
I was like,
Dang,
I don't know.
I've steered before.
I've shifted.

1121
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.430
I haven't done the whole thing all at once,
but he was sitting right there.

1122
01:06:55.431 --> 01:06:59.500
He just said,
take us there.
I was like,
dope.
I took,
took them there,
whatever.

1123
01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:02.220
He didn't critique much,
you know.
Um,

1124
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:05.350
but I got there and he just kind of let it happen.

1125
01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:10.380
It was the same kind of thing where first he's checking my steering,

1126
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.970
they knees check.
This is over time then the years and yeah,

1127
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.370
after awhile it's like buoys doesn't I he's still managing these right there.

1128
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:21.220
If you could slide his foot over to the break if you need to do,

1129
01:07:21.221 --> 01:07:23.500
I guess if need to put his hand on the wheel,

1130
01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:26.470
steer you away from the oncoming truck if need be.

1131
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.700
And at the same time he's letting me make little micro mistakes.

1132
01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:34.360
I hit the curb a little bit and it was more like,
you know,
stick shift,

1133
01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.140
do too much or yeah.
Well and he let that happen.

1134
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:42.020
He cause that's my thing to figure out the field cause each car is different and

1135
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.510
it's cool because that's actually good.

1136
01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:48.740
All at one time we were going on an operation on my first deployment to Iraq and

1137
01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.780
we were driving a far distance is through cities we'd never been through before.

1138
01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:01.200
And we've got turned around in the city and we work had a far way to go to our

1139
01:08:03.521 --> 01:08:04.061
objective.

1140
01:08:04.061 --> 01:08:09.061
It was a kind of a high profile operation and work.

1141
01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:14.340
We stop and I hear the call on the radio like all stop and I say something

1142
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.630
<v 0>along the lines of,
you know,
what's up?
And you know the,
the,</v>

1143
01:08:20.730 --> 01:08:24.200
the point man,
which is the lead Nav in the vehicles,

1144
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:28.100
he comes up on the radio EXEC.
I'm trying to get my bearings,

1145
01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:32.360
a little stress voice,
how walk up.

1146
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:37.130
So I get out of my vehicle just to make sure this guy's one of my bros and I

1147
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:41.690
walk up to the vehicle and he's in there and I could see he's,

1148
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:46.520
he's flustered,
he's flustered and he's uh,
you know,
um,

1149
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:51.650
I don't want to say embarrassed,
but he's flustered and now I'm there,

1150
01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:57.410
you know what I mean?
Yes.
And I think his thoughts are Jockos,

1151
01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.970
you know,
Jack was going to be mad or whatever.
Yeah.

1152
01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.170
And I go up and he's,

1153
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.140
he's cracks open the door,
right.

1154
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.060
I opened the door on the Humvee and I go,
you know,
what's up,

1155
01:09:11.061 --> 01:09:15.650
man?
Does in the most mellow voice.
I thought I'd go,
Hey,
what's up man?

1156
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.430
He goes,
I don't know where we are.
And I was like,
cool man.

1157
01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:22.730
Well we'll set security,
let me know when you've got it dialed.
And he's like,

1158
01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.800
all right,
cool.
And that's what we did.
And you took like,
you could see his face,

1159
01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:29.720
like he just turned back to computer,
started working.

1160
01:09:29.721 --> 01:09:33.650
But when I walked up to me and he could see that he was panicking because you

1161
01:09:33.651 --> 01:09:35.390
know,
you got read a bunch of vehicles,

1162
01:09:35.391 --> 01:09:40.130
you know you've got seven vehicles with us and they're all driving around and

1163
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:44.330
now you've done two laps around.
The news is not fun and there's,
and you know,

1164
01:09:44.331 --> 01:09:47.840
you make it through like pass the enemy.
One time you got away with,

1165
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.700
now you went by him three times

1166
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:55.310
and everyone in the whole troop is sitting there in the vehicle.
It's going,

1167
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:59.510
hold on Jack Ass is gonna run us by this checkpoint again or I just think again.

1168
01:09:59.511 --> 01:10:02.840
Yeah,
all of us.
So,
but yeah,
I just went up,
hey bro,

1169
01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.550
what's going on that I'm just trying to find.
I don't know where we're at.
Okay.

1170
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:09.650
We're going to set security.
Let me know when you've got to figure it out.

1171
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.090
It'll be good.
It's so good,
man.
And that's bad.

1172
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.970
That's so good on you because you know everyone that feeling the stress of like

1173
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:18.530
what you're seeing for sure.
He was like,
Dang,
where's this guy leaning?

1174
01:10:18.531 --> 01:10:21.160
That's what the hell does he not know?
I'm sure everyone was feeling that.
Yeah.

1175
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:25.070
Then it's like,
all right,
I got to kind of detached from that feeling and goes,

1176
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:29.750
Dang.
And then,
you know,
I got on the radio because that was,
you know,
I just said,

1177
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:31.910
uh,
I said the guy's name.
I was like,
Hey,

1178
01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.470
he's just getting it sorted out right now.

1179
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.380
We're gonna be rolling here at about a few minutes when we,

1180
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:38.960
when we know where we're at and everyone's,
you know,
set security,
boom,
done.

1181
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:42.800
There was another time we got ambushed on that same deployment.
Sure.

1182
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:48.070
And I was in vehicle number two and we were in a big convoy and the ambush

1183
01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:51.830
pretty much was aimed at the center and then the back of the convoy.

1184
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:56.060
So a bunch of machine gun fire,
a bunch of RPGs and nothing really hit.

1185
01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.770
And in fact,
nothing did hit.
The RPGs went over us.
And,

1186
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.570
and I was,
I would never say much on the radio,
right?
Sure.

1187
01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:09.260
And the guy in the back vehicle,
uh,
these actually the platoon chief,

1188
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:14.220
but I say I didn't say much,
but clearly we just got ambushed.

1189
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.240
<v 1>I mean,
there was a massive fire and explosions going off and we power,
you know,</v>

1190
01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.071
we go through that,

1191
01:11:19.071 --> 01:11:23.400
we continue on and the platoon chief in the back,

1192
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.300
he says something on the radio,
something along the lines of,
he's like,
you know,

1193
01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.580
comes up on the road.
He's like,
Hey Jack,
who,
you know,

1194
01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:33.510
we just got hit with an ambush back here.
And I got on the radio and I was like,

1195
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:38.170
Roger.
And,
and you know,
it's like,

1196
01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.990
it's it,
you know,
whatever it goes.
Okay.
I guess we're all right.
You know,

1197
01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:44.490
it's like all good.
All good in the hood.

1198
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:50.340
He did me like that one day.
Yes.
In fact,
when I say I think,
I mean,

1199
01:11:50.341 --> 01:11:55.170
I remember the time you didn't mean gay,
so I was,
forgive me right now.

1200
01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:57.960
You just talked about an actual ambush or actually happened.

1201
01:11:57.961 --> 01:12:00.480
I'm talking about something the way less impactful.
Just barely.

1202
01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.390
At least you're asking for forgiveness before you tell a grocery store.

1203
01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:09.270
It was actually this pocket we had recorded like a week or something early.

1204
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.140
So it's was like boom,
let me finish the whole thing,

1205
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.200
get it ready to get pushed out.
All I need.
It was done.

1206
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.740
All I had to do is press the button to make it live.
That's all I had to do.

1207
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:22.920
And this was like a week.
I think it might have even been two weeks in advance.

1208
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:26.720
Wow.
Those were the good old days.
Yeah.
But um,

1209
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:29.730
and then the day came,
it was so done and out of my mind.

1210
01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:32.010
The day came and I was just like,
Hey,
I don't know.
I don't know.

1211
01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:36.450
This is not on my mind.
So long story short,
I,
I didn't do it,
so

1212
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.230
I didn't press publish.
She was ready to go anyway.

1213
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:45.260
So I wake up in the morning as he messaged a bunch of Twitter posts.

1214
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.990
Right.
I understand that.
But I got a text message,

1215
01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:51.060
I think there might even been a phone call.
Oh No,
no,
no.

1216
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.740
It was a phone call and a text message from you this,
you know,
this is,

1217
01:12:56.730 --> 01:13:00.730
this is something,
you know,
I'm like,
all right.
No,

1218
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.240
I had no idea it was out of my mind.
I was like,
oh,

1219
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:04.710
something that obviously is something,
you know,

1220
01:13:04.711 --> 01:13:09.390
I get this early in the morning by the way.
So I look at it.
Um,

1221
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:13.740
and also I listen to the voice message first.
It was,
you all call me like,
hey,

1222
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:18.720
how's it going?
Good morning.
So it was,

1223
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:22.740
he goes,
um,
just to sort of let you know,
it's Wednesday,
you know,

1224
01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:25.230
we have that put that podcast we recorded.
That's,
you know,

1225
01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:29.190
that's supposed to be going on right now.
So whenever you can,

1226
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.350
whenever you're ready,
go ahead and post that.

1227
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.400
But it wasn't like all the Twitter post,
where's,
where's the book?

1228
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:40.890
Which book is a slacker,
you know all that.
Okay,
whenever you're ready,

1229
01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.900
it's all good.
You know?
I didn't know what happened.

1230
01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:44.850
Maybe you're under more stress.
You never know.

1231
01:13:44.851 --> 01:13:46.950
You got to think when you're in a leadership position,

1232
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:50.520
not that I'm like the leader here,
but if you're in a leadership position,

1233
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:51.810
you don't know what someone else is going through.

1234
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.600
Maybe you had some technical issue and I'm like going to call you up and be
like,

1235
01:13:54.601 --> 01:13:57.040
well,
where's that thing?
And now you freak out.
You're making it worse.
Yeah.

1236
01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.230
I don't need to make it any worse.

1237
01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:02.370
There's something going on like you were sleeping or whatever.
I didn't want,

1238
01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:02.920
you know,

1239
01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.610
but you always think about the respective of the other person that you're

1240
01:14:05.611 --> 01:14:09.630
dealing with and you don't want to escalate things that's not going to help.

1241
01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.070
Just deescalate.
Hey man,
just

1242
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.740
<v 0>wondering what's up with new,
if you need anything from me on the podcast,</v>

1243
01:14:14.741 --> 01:14:18.940
maybe we need to rerecord it.
I don't know.
Let me know.
I'll be over.

1244
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:20.403
That's what we're here for.

1245
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:23.830
Like with two people shouting at each other and you chime in so he's still off

1246
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:28.470
drowning and you're three people shouting.
Yeah,
messing it up.

1247
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:31.030
Anyway.
Next question

1248
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:35.103
Jocko.

1249
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.440
I'm not sure I agree with your statements not to pursue belts in Jiu Jitsu.

1250
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:46.450
It doesn't seem wrong to me to benchmark success using a rise in rank as a

1251
01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:51.451
quantifiable measure of success as a person is working to master their craft.

1252
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.980
Any craft.
It's nice to have markers for accomplishment and engagement.

1253
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:58.143
Wive belts.

1254
01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:02.660
Why have belts if they're not to be strived for or why have them.
Right.

1255
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.790
And that's actually a little conversation I had that I,

1256
01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.950
as soon as he asked me this,
this is with Brandon,
you know,

1257
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:11.470
Brandon picked birth yet.
Uh,
he's,

1258
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:15.670
he's been around like since day one in the game here.

1259
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:18.850
And we were going back and forth on some and he said,

1260
01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.760
he actually sent me this random cause he sent me texts about stuff,
you know,

1261
01:15:21.761 --> 01:15:24.040
whatever,
we're doing some projects and,
and whatnot.

1262
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:28.540
And he sent me this random thing.
Well,

1263
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:31.210
I guess it's random to meet.
It was random to him.

1264
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.460
Maybe he just listened to a podcast where we were talking about this,

1265
01:15:33.461 --> 01:15:35.160
but he said,
you know,
hey,
I don't know,

1266
01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:39.910
you don't want to know what I agree with this stuff about belts.
Yeah.
And so,

1267
01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.940
and by the way Brandon is had a goal of doing a hundred burpees and 10 minutes.

1268
01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:48.790
Brandon is in good shape.
He's an athlete,
athletic dude.

1269
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:51.610
And for some reason he can't do a hundred burpees and 10 minutes.

1270
01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.840
I don't know where he's at right now.

1271
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:57.550
We are publicly calling him out to post his,
you know,

1272
01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:02.200
video video,
no cuts,
no cuts or maybe it doesn't have to post the whole thing.

1273
01:16:02.201 --> 01:16:05.020
I take his word for it cause he's owned it a bunch of times.

1274
01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:08.680
You'll put like he'll do a hundred in.

1275
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.180
Oh no I think of what he's been doing.

1276
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:13.000
He's been doing 10 minutes worth however many he can do.

1277
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:18.360
He gets like 84 yeah food and he'll post it like I did 84 in 10 minutes you can

1278
01:16:19.571 --> 01:16:24.430
do 10 that the 10 tens of one to 10 every within 30 10 every minute or
something.

1279
01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:28.380
It has to be less cause actual burpees.
We'll take a certain amount of time.
Yeah,

1280
01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.100
that's what I'm telling you.
10 in a minute is not that hard.

1281
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:34.180
Yeah.

1282
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:39.180
But plus your rest 10 burpee pull ups in a minute is harder but still a good

1283
01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:42.700
measure.
So just regular burpees

1284
01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.800
but back to the conversation.
I'm going to try that by the way.
Okay.

1285
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:50.650
So Brandon hit me up and,

1286
01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.340
and you know I understand belts,

1287
01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:57.190
you know and it's cause cause we've sent on here like don't worry about bells,

1288
01:16:57.191 --> 01:16:58.450
don't worry about the bells.
The bells are going to come.

1289
01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:04.140
I understand belts and I understand trying to earn a rank and that's cool.

1290
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.800
But I'm telling you at some point,

1291
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:11.540
and I think this will happen to everybody

1292
01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:18.090
at at some point Jujitsu becomes a lot more than just belts.

1293
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:21.530
And eventually the Jujitsu itself

1294
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:28.210
completely bypasses what the belts are and what the belts mean.

1295
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:32.790
Now I could,
you could say back to me like,
well that's because you're a backhoe.

1296
01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:35.600
And so that's why you feel that way because of course they don't matter to you.

1297
01:17:35.601 --> 01:17:37.010
You're already a black box.
You,
you know,

1298
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.670
but the fact is that that didn't happen to me.

1299
01:17:40.671 --> 01:17:43.040
A black belt that happened to me at like purple belt.

1300
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:47.450
I think about midway of my purple belt time.

1301
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.050
I had no care whatsoever of what bell color I was.

1302
01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:56.130
This is literally zero and I just wanted to get better.

1303
01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:57.770
I just wanted to know more.

1304
01:17:57.771 --> 01:18:00.320
I just wanted to keep training and it never even thought about it after that.

1305
01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:04.250
And like,
even like degrees on your PR,

1306
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.160
on your black belt,
the Pete,

1307
01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.080
I was talking to Pete Roberts the other day and he's like,

1308
01:18:09.081 --> 01:18:11.220
well what degree are you,
you know,
he's a black belt and blah blah blah.

1309
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:16.040
He's like,
what degree are you?
And I was like,
man,
I don't know.
I don't know.

1310
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.280
I got my black belt in 2005 what does that mean?
You know what I mean?

1311
01:18:19.281 --> 01:18:22.280
Like I don't have the tape on there with how many degrees I am.

1312
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.350
Not that I don't respect it,
but I just don't care for me personally.

1313
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:31.700
So,
and I think that this isn't like,

1314
01:18:31.701 --> 01:18:34.220
he's like Brandon talk about,
you know,
to master any craft.

1315
01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:37.270
I think it's the same with any craft that you're trying to master.
Yeah.

1316
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.600
If you're trying to master the craft,
yeah.
Hopefully.

1317
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:46.630
And eventually the craft itself becomes more important than the rank that comes

1318
01:18:48.531 --> 01:18:53.000
with being skilled at the craft.
Yeah.
That's what I would hope for.
That's what,

1319
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.080
by the way,

1320
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.670
that also makes it a lot easier to keep pursuing because I don't care.
My,

1321
01:18:58.671 --> 01:19:01.580
I'm not sitting there going,
Oh God,
I hope we get a stripe on my belt today.
No,

1322
01:19:01.581 --> 01:19:03.500
I don't care if I get to start my belt,
I want to go learn more.

1323
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.460
And guess what's going to propel you towards more stripes?
Wanting to learn more,

1324
01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.180
wanting more stripes does not propel you towards getting more stripes.

1325
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:15.380
What propels you towards getting more stripes and getting advanced in any craft

1326
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.370
is getting better at that craft.
So focus on getting better at the craft.
Yes sir.

1327
01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.390
The belts are going to come.
Yes sir.
Even your belt is going to come one day.

1328
01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:26.660
Preach it.
I'm not concerned with belts,

1329
01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:30.230
so we're glad you're not,
that you're going to go up much in your future

1330
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:36.590
nonetheless.
Yet.
And I think that this,

1331
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:38.420
it's like a matter of perspective.
The Kit,
first off,

1332
01:19:38.421 --> 01:19:41.300
you've been a black belt and thinking that or whatever and be like,
yeah,

1333
01:19:41.301 --> 01:19:44.150
that's easy.
It seems like that's obvious that,
oh,

1334
01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:45.620
it's easy for you to say because you're a black belt,

1335
01:19:45.621 --> 01:19:48.350
but at the same time it doesn't kind of go along with that detachment thing.

1336
01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.450
It's like,
Hey,
I'm not in the game.

1337
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.870
There's no reason for me to be striving for any belt right now so I can be

1338
01:19:53.871 --> 01:19:56.720
detached.
I'm not emotionally invested in the whole situation.

1339
01:19:56.721 --> 01:20:00.620
I can look back in and at the same time understand when I came up,

1340
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:04.270
me being focused on belts would not have gotten me here.
You know,

1341
01:20:04.271 --> 01:20:06.620
like you have that clear vision.
I that's natural.

1342
01:20:06.621 --> 01:20:09.590
It's a natural thing to be like a blue belt and Oh,

1343
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.630
I wish I could wear that purple belt and everyone would know me and respect me

1344
01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:15.870
as a purple belt and Abi calm.
It's tapping some of the purple belts right now.

1345
01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:20.310
Yeah.
In Bro d there's a side note,
I don't know if you know this,

1346
01:20:20.311 --> 01:20:25.311
but if you know the feeling of wanting that purple belt really bad and I just

1347
01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:29.130
want that purple belt and your skills from your,

1348
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:32.970
from your instructor standpoint don't match purple belt and promotion time comes

1349
01:20:32.971 --> 01:20:35.040
along and you're okay,
this is a damn.

1350
01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:36.810
I get my bread and you don't get that purple belt bring.

1351
01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:38.850
You know how sad you're going to be real.
So I had,

1352
01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:43.830
I have known people that quit the gym straight up cause they didn't get promoted

1353
01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:48.390
on a,
on a certain day.
And you know what that is?
That's really sad.
It is.

1354
01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:51.090
It's said from top to bottom for sure.
That's a side note.

1355
01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.350
But I guess sad wasn't even the right word.
Well it's sad for them.
Yes.

1356
01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.310
Because if you were here in that zone where you should be getting your purple

1357
01:20:59.311 --> 01:21:02.100
belt,
that sometime maybe this promotion,
maybe next promotion,

1358
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:03.060
maybe some other promotion,

1359
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:06.210
that means your dedicated Jujitsu and now you're just going to walk away because

1360
01:21:06.211 --> 01:21:10.200
you didn't get belch.
Yeah,
that's,
yeah,
it's rough.
And like I said,

1361
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:14.850
like that state of mind can really,
really gem.
UIC.
Yeah man.
True Story.

1362
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:18.570
And I've heard of people where they didn't get their belt and then maybe someone

1363
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:22.080
else did not,
maybe straight up other people did and it was their belt,
you know,

1364
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:26.370
like Super Mad to the point where they're vocal about it.
I tapped that guy out.

1365
01:21:26.371 --> 01:21:30.780
Why did he get his belt public openly saying that.
So yeah,
it,
it'll jam you up.

1366
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:31.680
Just that whole mindset.

1367
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.800
One thing I would say to those people that might be thinking that way for my

1368
01:21:37.051 --> 01:21:41.840
perspective and for many Jujitsu instructors,
the you're,

1369
01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:46.200
you're advancing and you're getting promoted based on your potential,

1370
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:51.590
not based on your skill level to like people because you might be,

1371
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:58.320
you might not have a lot of potential.
And so,
you know what,
hey man,

1372
01:21:58.321 --> 01:22:00.270
the guys,
you know,
he can't train.

1373
01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:05.280
He's 68 years old and he's been training for a year and a half.

1374
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.390
He's learned a lot of knowledge.
He's here all the time.
I mean,

1375
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:12.000
he can't tap out any other blue belts.

1376
01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:17.130
We're giving him his blue belt because for a potential of him as a 68 year old

1377
01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:19.620
man that never worked out before.
And now he's training Jujitsu.

1378
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:24.570
Do that guys a blue belt.
Yeah.
Um,
now the further you go up,
you know,

1379
01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:28.920
black belt is a little bit more serious.
Uh,
so it was brown,
so it was purple.

1380
01:22:28.921 --> 01:22:31.410
But I'm saying you're getting judged against yourself.

1381
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:35.310
And that's an extreme example by someone else.
By the way,
not by yourself.

1382
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.070
You're being judged by your instructor,
not yourself.
Yeah,
that's right.

1383
01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.680
That's right.
It's just like,
yeah,
man.
And that's the,

1384
01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:44.310
and that's an important thing.
What's your,
to your point,

1385
01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:48.990
everything that we're talking about right now makes Jujitsu suck.
Right?

1386
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:51.600
It makes sure to sees it.
Like it makes it a,
maybe it'll make you mad,

1387
01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:54.150
it'll make you frustrated,
it'll make you,
it'll make it political.

1388
01:22:54.151 --> 01:22:57.350
And this guy got an,
I didn't know.
That's not for me.
I just don't like it.

1389
01:22:57.351 --> 01:23:01.020
That stuff.
Yeah.
You know,
don't even like that stuff.
So,
uh,

1390
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.470
when you're ready,
your instructor's going to promote you until then.

1391
01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.910
Keep training.
Yeah.
And by the way,
also in your work skills,

1392
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.310
when you're ready to get promoted,
you'll get promoted.
Yeah.

1393
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.750
And if you're not ready,
you won't.
Or there's not an opening,
you won't,

1394
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:20.020
you know what you do to solve that.
Don't get frustrated,

1395
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.190
don't get all crazy.
Don't blame the guy that did get promoted.

1396
01:23:24.191 --> 01:23:28.000
Don't undermine him.
You know what you do?
Keep kicking ass.
Wait.

1397
01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:32.170
Next time it'll be your turn and enjoy what you're doing.
Master your craft.

1398
01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:35.260
Yes sir.
Don't let your craft become your master.

1399
01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:41.940
I just said that thing.
I liked it.
And that's what happens,
right?
Yeah.

1400
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.550
The thing control you instead of you controlling the thing,

1401
01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.810
instead of you mastering it,

1402
01:23:46.811 --> 01:23:48.970
it's starting to master you and getting your head back.
Yeah.

1403
01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.010
But he doesn't make a good point.

1404
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:55.620
And here's the thing is that this is a mix of perspective.
So where,

1405
01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:59.820
um,
or a clashing of perspectives where he was like,
aren't,
you know,

1406
01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:01.750
as a person working to master their craft,
any craft,

1407
01:24:01.751 --> 01:24:05.310
it's nice to have markers for accomplishment and engagement.
That's true.

1408
01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:08.080
And you know what?
I actually texted back to him.
I'm like,
hey man,

1409
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:11.230
I know I'm not normal.
I'm not normal.

1410
01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:16.090
And all I need is a rock and a hill.
That's when I texted to him and he laughed.

1411
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:18.520
Right.
But so,

1412
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:23.440
so there are normal people that need to have,
like I want a goal,
I want to see,

1413
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:26.800
I wanted to have a checkpoint and that's okay.
Yeah.
And that's why,
guess what,

1414
01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:30.320
there are belts in Jujitsu and you can get,
sir,
I don't,

1415
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:35.110
we don't really give a lot of stripes out at victory like me,
Jeff Glover,

1416
01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:37.840
rain lister,
Craig,
James.

1417
01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:42.430
I mean we will give out like occasional stripes,
you know,
for various reasons.

1418
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:46.000
But most of the time it's like,
oh,
the guys ready for his next belt.

1419
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.970
Just give it to them.
Yeah.
And you shall live stripes.

1420
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:49.710
That's a subtle thing in my opinion.

1421
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:54.720
Like I've stripes don't reflect much compared to bullet belts nonetheless.

1422
01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:00.030
Yeah.
Cool.
Blue Belt,
right.

1423
01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.250
That guy was the deal.

1424
01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:05.980
But he's saying,

1425
01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:10.540
and you know what to to degrade what you're saying and what Brandon is saying,

1426
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:14.410
you know,
when we do a lot of stripes and a lot of different colored belts kids,

1427
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:19.330
right.
And that's needs going to be the point yet as a grown ass adult Brandon

1428
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:24.350
now as a grown man,
you should be like,
I'm just here to learn.
Yeah.

1429
01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.270
Well to me what he's saying doesn't clash with what you're saying in my opinion,

1430
01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:32.980
no matter thing with Brandon is Brandon is,
you know,
I don't know him that well,

1431
01:25:32.981 --> 01:25:37.230
but you know,
we go back and forth a lot.
He's a guy that's like metric-driven,

1432
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:37.631
you know,

1433
01:25:37.631 --> 01:25:40.270
like I'm going to get somebody to get this and would get that and that's
awesome.

1434
01:25:40.271 --> 01:25:44.440
That's what makes him successful in what he does and the craft that he has

1435
01:25:44.441 --> 01:25:49.240
mastered.
Very successful.
But he likes to have those.
Yeah.

1436
01:25:49.241 --> 01:25:52.270
Those measurements have metrics to go off and say,
look,
I just crushed this,

1437
01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:55.690
this goal.
Boom.
Done.
Yeah.
So,
well,
yeah.

1438
01:25:55.691 --> 01:25:57.610
And so with belts is going to be a little bit different.

1439
01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:01.120
Just like with promotions that you know,
based on a skill.
So you,

1440
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:04.160
he says it's nice to have markers in your thing.

1441
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:09.050
It is nice of course after when you got your black belt for you to say,

1442
01:26:09.051 --> 01:26:13.010
I don't care the fact that I got this black belt,
I don't care about that at all.

1443
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:16.310
I don't know if I would believe no,
no,
no,
you're,
you'd be correct.
Yeah,

1444
01:26:16.311 --> 01:26:17.810
you'd be correct.
I was.
I was stoked.

1445
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:20.310
It's just a matter of what you're striving for.

1446
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.070
What kind of surprise me do like I wasn't expecting it.
Right.

1447
01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:24.930
Which should tell you something.
Yes.

1448
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:27.570
I wasn't in there like tonight's probably going to be big night.
No,

1449
01:26:27.610 --> 01:26:32.120
I like showed up at the gym and trained or whatever and then all of a sudden it

1450
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:35.550
was special ceremony time and we've got the black belts.
Yeah.

1451
01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.960
And I was stoked for sure.
Yeah.
I was stoked to putting,

1452
01:26:37.961 --> 01:26:40.520
you know what's funny is like at the team,

1453
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:46.430
like people,
people like,
I don't know who heard about it,
but people are like,

1454
01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:48.290
hey man,
I heard you got your black belt.
And I was like,
yeah,
yeah.

1455
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.900
But I didn't tell anyone.
I wasn't like,
hey everyone,
I got my black belt.
Yeah.

1456
01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:56.240
You know?
But you know,
you know what?

1457
01:26:56.241 --> 01:26:59.360
You know what belt I cared the most about was my purple belt.
Yeah.

1458
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:02.870
When I got my purple belt I was super pumped.
Yeah.

1459
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.620
At that time it was a big deal.
Getting your purple belt.

1460
01:27:06.670 --> 01:27:10.100
I got my purple belt from Fabio Santos.
Yeah.
I wasn't given away then.

1461
01:27:10.101 --> 01:27:14.690
Purple belts either know
you had that,
that thing.

1462
01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:16.940
Yeah.
And you know what with and I don't know,

1463
01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:18.860
cause obviously I wasn't there at that time,

1464
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:22.190
but I think it's always going to be like that.
Well,
if you get a purple belt,

1465
01:27:22.191 --> 01:27:23.240
that's a big deal.

1466
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:27.560
Even now it seems like is definitely a big deal because there's just so many

1467
01:27:27.561 --> 01:27:31.700
people now doing what you did to no purple belt.
Purple belt is a legitimate,

1468
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:36.410
when you're a purple belt,
you will not lose in a fight to a normal person.

1469
01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:41.570
No.
In my opinion.
Oh,
could you get caught with a punchy Asher,
but a normal,

1470
01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.160
you know,
you've got a very high,

1471
01:27:43.161 --> 01:27:46.040
high percentage of winning a fight against a normal person.

1472
01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:49.330
If you are a purple belt in Jujitsu,
a good purple belt.
Yeah.

1473
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:53.070
Meaning not someone that just like got a purple belt for no reason.
Right,
right.

1474
01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:57.080
Real real perpetrator Jujitsu.
I mean,
a purple belt.
You're rolling.

1475
01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.620
When I roll with a purple belt,
it's a good role.
You know,
it was a good role.

1476
01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:03.860
It's not like,
oh,
this guy's just a purple belt,
blue belt.

1477
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:09.410
Most blue belts,
you don't have to worry about much of anything.

1478
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:12.980
Yeah.
When you're at a higher level.
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.
I mean,

1479
01:28:12.981 --> 01:28:15.170
you're not worrying where you're rolling with most blue belts.
Right.

1480
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.800
I'm worried when I wrote with everybody.
No,
no,
no.
Worried.
Why?
No,

1481
01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:21.950
I'm just joking.
Yeah,
I dig it.

1482
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:25.550
He's not saying you're disrespectful,

1483
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:30.350
but I'm not saying you're disrespectful to a blue belt,
but,
but realistically,

1484
01:28:30.351 --> 01:28:35.351
you know that chances are there's no possible way for them to submit you very

1485
01:28:36.501 --> 01:28:39.210
small for both skill levels.
Don't match.

1486
01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:43.730
Slap a triangle on you or something and grab your arms somewhere.
Well,
yeah,
uh,

1487
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:47.960
yeah,
that can help.
Noah,
you rolled with Noah lately.
He tapped me out.
Oh Damn.

1488
01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.410
I mean not,
but yeah,
like within the last year,

1489
01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:55.880
he straighten my arm out real far.
Yeah.
I had to go into level nine,

1490
01:28:55.881 --> 01:29:00.470
defense mode agency escalate.
Oh,
I would be full.
And I,

1491
01:29:00.471 --> 01:29:02.040
and he me,
that was

1492
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.490
<v 1>the thing,
you know,
we're rolling and,
and all of a sudden,
and he's a purple belt.</v>

1493
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.400
That's,
there you have it.
There's a classic example in this.

1494
01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.750
I'm going to give him,
I'm going to give him a nickname right now.
Good.
Noah,

1495
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.040
because he's good and he's very handsome by the way.
He's better than your team.

1496
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.610
I'll let you judge that one.
But he's better than a typical purple belt though.

1497
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.510
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But nonetheless,
to your point,

1498
01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:26.820
that's exactly to your point though.
If you have a purple belt,
you're,

1499
01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:30.780
you're nuts.
You're not,
you don't have many holes.
No.
Maybe some timing things,

1500
01:29:30.781 --> 01:29:35.040
maybe some,
you know,
whatever.
Yeah.
He's a classic example.
Yeah.
No,

1501
01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:38.430
it was a good purple belt watch out.
But yeah,

1502
01:29:38.431 --> 01:29:42.840
you don't pursue will ask me all the time.
When do I get my brown belt?
No,

1503
01:29:42.841 --> 01:29:47.490
I'm just kidding.
No,
he doesn't care.
He's the type of dude that is like,
Hey,

1504
01:29:47.491 --> 01:29:49.170
I'll just get to sit around,
tap everyone out.

1505
01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:51.900
Maybe one day they'll give me a belt.
Maybe they won't.
I don't care.

1506
01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:56.160
Keep crushing it.
And that's how,
and tapping out Echo Charles.

1507
01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:57.960
No Bro.
What's up?

1508
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:59.940
Did you give him your brown belt once you got tapped out by him?

1509
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:03.780
I want it to do you know what's cool when you get tapped out by a lower belt?

1510
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:06.840
It's a guess what Jujitsu works.

1511
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:11.740
They should be able to wear your belt for this for the rest of your life.
No,

1512
01:30:12.230 --> 01:30:16.780
it works.
You do a Jujitsu move against me.
I'm going to tap out to it.
Yeah.

1513
01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:20.130
Like that's the way it works.
And you know,
you know,
I might try the defense,

1514
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:23.460
but the Jujitsu works.
Yes sir.

1515
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.500
I mean we just saw Roger Gracie Hodra Gracie against boot Chach yeah.

1516
01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:32.010
And people were a little bit freaked out and I was like,
yeah,
Jiu Jitsu works.

1517
01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:35.760
Yeah.
You know you get that choke on boot JETRO boutiques.

1518
01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.030
Is it animal?
Yeah.
Savage,
yes.

1519
01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.380
But get that Geek Color Sunken choke and you got,

1520
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:47.760
you got Hodrick Gracie x amount of times world champion.

1521
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:51.270
Can you imagine his grip strength or you rolled with them?
Grip strength.

1522
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.480
Grip strength.
It was really good.
But,

1523
01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:57.180
and I'm not to go into a whole thing about Hodges game,

1524
01:30:57.181 --> 01:30:59.760
but he has this thing where,

1525
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:02.820
this is weird if you don't know the depths of Jujitsu,

1526
01:31:02.821 --> 01:31:06.780
but he has this feeling that he has all bases covered.
So he's not necessarily,

1527
01:31:06.781 --> 01:31:10.290
his game isn't to out hustle you as not to out speed you.

1528
01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.930
And it's not that strength you for sure,
but it's like he,

1529
01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:14.970
it's like he has this whole base,

1530
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.440
like all his bases in the Jujitsu situation,
they're all covered.

1531
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:23.410
So he'll do this thing that,
and he was trying to do them.
We checked,

1532
01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:25.980
but you know,
it was just really,
really good.

1533
01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.610
He'll grab one sleeve with the opposite hand,

1534
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.280
grab the elbow from closed guard way.

1535
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:35.610
I know Paul and he'll just wind up on your back and there's nothing you can do

1536
01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:39.210
about it while you're a little defensive.
He's got those covered,
no problem.

1537
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:41.380
And it's just this thing that,
it just,
it's,

1538
01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:44.370
it's like this eventuality that you have no defense for it.

1539
01:31:44.371 --> 01:31:46.680
That's how it feels his whole game.
So yes.

1540
01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:50.870
I mean it's crazy that he was able to bring that same game to someone like we

1541
01:31:50.871 --> 01:31:55.080
Cheshire.
Yup.
He was leaving just as a beast.
Yeah.
He's,
yeah.

1542
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:58.170
It's just crazy.
But yeah,
that's how nonetheless,
back to the point,

1543
01:31:58.470 --> 01:32:02.350
don't pursue the belt.
That's not the pursuit.
The pursuit is getting better.

1544
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.020
The belts will come when the bill comes to the,

1545
01:32:05.021 --> 01:32:09.700
to to Brandon's 0.1,
the belt comes.
That is nice.
And to me,

1546
01:32:09.701 --> 01:32:14.470
when you get your belt from your instructor,
not from yourself,
when you get old,

1547
01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:18.680
if you're personal.
But if you're the guy who's getting mad,
yeah.

1548
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:21.790
If you're the guy that's getting mad and because you think you should've got

1549
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:24.460
your belt,
you're thinking you're getting your belt from yourself.

1550
01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:29.100
That's what you're thinking in your head.
Yes,
yes.
Exactly right,
so forget that.

1551
01:32:29.101 --> 01:32:32.440
I'm ready.
Yeah,
I'm ready.
Exactly.
It's not up to you.
It's not up to you.

1552
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:34.960
You can tap out all the black belts.
It's still not up to you.

1553
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.550
It's up to you instructor anyway,
when you get your purple belt.
Brown belt.

1554
01:32:39.551 --> 01:32:44.200
Black belt.
Yeah,
that's belt.
I would say this happens more times than not.

1555
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:46.120
If you're a blue belt,
you're rolling.
You're getting good.

1556
01:32:46.121 --> 01:32:48.850
You're learning a lot when you get a purple but purple belt that's going to

1557
01:32:48.851 --> 01:32:52.870
empower you so much to be like,
now my standard just mentally is higher now.

1558
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:57.610
I'm a purple belt now.
That's my minimum standard right now.
Well,

1559
01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:01.450
a purple belt is full on in the game.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.

1560
01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:05.740
You can't really be super casual and get a purple belt.
I'm saying.

1561
01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:10.190
Yeah,
I'm saying it is empowering and it is you.

1562
01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:13.360
You're going to have a lot of pride with that?
Well,
I wouldn't say empowering.

1563
01:33:13.450 --> 01:33:17.440
I would say it puts you,
um,
it,
it,

1564
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:21.640
it raises the bar on you.
Yeah.
Like once you're wearing a purple ball,

1565
01:33:21.641 --> 01:33:24.790
you can't be,
you know,
now you're like,
I can't tap to these blue belts anymore.

1566
01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:28.940
You might,
but I'm saying same thing to me.
Tomato,
tomato raises the bar.
Yeah.

1567
01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:33.460
What did you say?
It raises your standards.
Yeah,
a rolling like my own basically.

1568
01:33:33.461 --> 01:33:38.080
Exactly what you said was raised.
Yeah.
I got to represent all this stuff.

1569
01:33:38.081 --> 01:33:41.110
It's like,
it comes with a sense of pride.
So yes,
it's a huge,
it's a deal.

1570
01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.620
And that's good.
I also,
when you're a blue belt,
enjoy being a blue belt,

1571
01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:46.990
you didn't take more risks.
You can get tapped out.
Doesn't matter.

1572
01:33:46.991 --> 01:33:51.250
You let it flow.
Let it flow 100%.
But yeah,

1573
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:53.830
when you get that belt,
yeah.
Beat,
be happy,
be prideful,

1574
01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:58.030
posted on Facebook and thank your training partners,
all that stuff.

1575
01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:03.010
But don't just pursue the belt,
man.
It'll jam.
You don't pick Tim.
Next question.

1576
01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:06.340
I'm a 24 year old machinist.
I work CNC machines,

1577
01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:08.260
do setups in order tooling.

1578
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:11.800
Most of the people I work with have worked here for over 15 years.

1579
01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:15.850
The owner of my company wants to make me the shop manager and honestly I'm not

1580
01:34:15.851 --> 01:34:16.810
too tore up about it.

1581
01:34:17.170 --> 01:34:22.170
I feel like the older guys who've been around won't want to take scheduling and

1582
01:34:23.351 --> 01:34:25.450
Mac manufacturing advice from a young guy.

1583
01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.100
I have good relationships with all the shop guys put.

1584
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:32.770
I'm worried about stepping into this role so soon.

1585
01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:37.480
Only been with the company for three years.
Any advice?
Okay,

1586
01:34:37.570 --> 01:34:41.640
your boss isn't asking you to do this job if you're not ready for it.
That's,

1587
01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:44.950
that's number one and the fact that you don't think you're ready is a good sign.

1588
01:34:44.951 --> 01:34:48.380
I've said this before because it means that you're humble,
so you feel like that.

1589
01:34:48.381 --> 01:34:48.791
That's good.

1590
01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:50.710
That's probably one of the reasons why you're doing well and probably one of the

1591
01:34:50.711 --> 01:34:52.780
reasons that your boss thinks you're ready for the jobs because you're humble,

1592
01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:53.673
so that's good,

1593
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.070
but you also have to remember that being humble has to be balanced.
Dichotomy

1594
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.970
<v 0>of leadership with confidence and even with a little bit of aggression.</v>

1595
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:05.710
So there's a reason that you're getting asked to do this job and the boss needs

1596
01:35:05.711 --> 01:35:06.471
you to step up.

1597
01:35:06.471 --> 01:35:09.910
Now just because you become the manager or the boss doesn't mean yet.

1598
01:35:09.911 --> 01:35:13.310
You have to start bossing people around,
right?

1599
01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.590
It actually means that you should remain humble,

1600
01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:17.600
that you should take input from them,

1601
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:22.730
that you can still take advice from them as opposed to just giving them advice.

1602
01:35:22.731 --> 01:35:24.950
All those things are fine.

1603
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.190
And I just kind of asked this question the other day,
young,
uh,
uh,

1604
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.360
construction business and a kid and we were in a big meeting with a,

1605
01:35:34.821 --> 01:35:39.821
with a bunch of leadership from foreman to engineers all in the same room.

1606
01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:45.410
A bunch of great guys from a great company and one of the young engineers raised

1607
01:35:45.411 --> 01:35:46.071
his hand and said,
you know,

1608
01:35:46.071 --> 01:35:50.600
I'm young and I am going to be in charge of these guys.

1609
01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.920
You know,
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with these guys.

1610
01:35:53.921 --> 01:35:57.710
Had been doing it for a lot longer.
What can I do to,
you know,
gain their respect.

1611
01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:00.080
And I said,
okay,

1612
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:06.610
who in this room knows more than that engineer back there about construction and

1613
01:36:06.681 --> 01:36:11.600
all these salty constructs in foreman's raised their hands.
And I said,

1614
01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:14.180
who?
You know,
who's gonna think that this guy's got the best idea?

1615
01:36:14.181 --> 01:36:16.610
Raise your hands.
All the hands go down.
And I said,

1616
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:20.240
so this is what you're dealing with buddy.
I said,

1617
01:36:20.241 --> 01:36:23.240
now let me ask another question.
The group group,

1618
01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:27.410
if this kid comes in and says,
I know how to do this better than you.

1619
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:31.250
Listen to me and do it my way,
who's going to have respect for him?

1620
01:36:31.251 --> 01:36:36.080
Raise your hand.
No hands go up.
If this young kid comes in and says,

1621
01:36:36.081 --> 01:36:40.130
Hey,
I'm an engineer.
I've been educated,
but I haven't been doing this for a long,

1622
01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:44.210
can you give me some recommendations on how we do this so we can do the best job

1623
01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:46.970
possible?
Who's going to have respect for him?
Everyone raises their hand.

1624
01:36:47.630 --> 01:36:49.990
So there you have it.
You,

1625
01:36:50.170 --> 01:36:54.290
you don't have to know everything as a leader.
No one expects you to everything,

1626
01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.850
especially as a young leader.
That's okay.

1627
01:36:56.790 --> 01:37:00.020
And actually when you admit that you actually gain respect,

1628
01:37:00.230 --> 01:37:02.540
when you ask for people's input,
you actually gain respect.

1629
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:05.960
People get the paranoid feeling that if they don't know something,

1630
01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:09.290
they're going to be seen as weak.
It's not true.
So

1631
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:15.680
you can just step up to the position.
Still be humble,
still take advice.

1632
01:37:15.681 --> 01:37:18.710
Now this doesn't mean that you're a pushover,
right?

1633
01:37:18.711 --> 01:37:22.400
That doesn't mean that you just listen to what everyone says and you don't make

1634
01:37:22.401 --> 01:37:23.390
any decisions.
No.

1635
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.330
It actually means that you show respect to their experience and when it comes

1636
01:37:26.331 --> 01:37:27.320
time to make a decision,

1637
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:29.870
you get the best input and then you make a decision and you explain your

1638
01:37:29.871 --> 01:37:32.480
decision.
And if your decision is wrong,
you admit it.
And if it's not wrong,

1639
01:37:32.481 --> 01:37:36.110
you push forward.
So that's what you need to do.

1640
01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:38.150
You're getting asked to be put in this position for a reason.

1641
01:37:38.210 --> 01:37:43.070
So do it get some things like a common one?
Yeah,

1642
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:46.700
that one.
I'm 70 in the new role for sure.
Everyone asks that question.

1643
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:50.750
I answered it again.
There you go.
For everyone's benefit,
including my own,

1644
01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:55.380
I learned from it every time.
That's the ethos,
right?
Colin?
Humble.
Yeah.

1645
01:37:56.370 --> 01:38:01.320
<v 2>Be Open minded.
Take advice.
Yes,
yes,
yes.
Don't have to know everything.
Yes.</v>

1646
01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:04.463
Three days ago

1647
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:09.480
or neighbor young girl and one of my daughter's friends,

1648
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:13.560
12 years old and she comes over there messing around.
They're swimming,

1649
01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:19.920
she grabs my daughter's jump rope and she's jumping rope and she does the cross,

1650
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:23.310
you know,
you jump up and you cross crossover crossover.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1651
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.340
So he does that.
And Man,
I used to jump rope back in the day,

1652
01:38:26.341 --> 01:38:30.960
but I never really could do the crossovers.
Let's face it nonetheless.

1653
01:38:30.961 --> 01:38:35.040
So she's jump roping in jumping rope and I'm like,
Hey,

1654
01:38:35.041 --> 01:38:38.010
do that cross the crossover thing again.
She does it.
She's doing,
you know,

1655
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.380
she's 12 years old.
You've done.
I'm like,
Dang,
I never could do that.

1656
01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:43.230
And she's like,
well you just got to do it like this until that.
So I'm like,
okay.

1657
01:38:43.231 --> 01:38:48.210
I grabbed the rope and I try and the roasts do small,
so I go grab my rope.

1658
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:51.810
Yeah,
I've got to jump rope.
Uhm,
well I told my daughter grab it.
So she grabs it.

1659
01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:55.920
And this is,
this is like a kind of like one of those pro speed ropes,
you know,

1660
01:38:55.921 --> 01:38:59.220
so it's like kind of,
so if I make a mistake on this rope is going to hurt.

1661
01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:00.990
I didn't have any shoes on.
I was barefoot.

1662
01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:05.930
So Hawaiian itself for sure 100% and then so I go forward,

1663
01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:08.760
I'm dumb or I can jump rope still pretty good right now.
It's still,

1664
01:39:08.761 --> 01:39:12.810
I haven't done it in awhile.
And she goes,
okay,

1665
01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:16.360
so right here at the top,
you know,
you,
you cross you,

1666
01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:18.140
this is where you want to cross at the top of try it.
Ooh,

1667
01:39:18.141 --> 01:39:21.800
he hits my foot painful.
And she's like,
no,
you got to do more at the time.

1668
01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:27.210
No,
no,
no,
no.
Never showed the paint to the kids.
I try not to anyway.

1669
01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:32.040
So I was like,
okay,
boom,
fail.
She could,
she was like,
no more at the top.
You know,

1670
01:39:32.041 --> 01:39:35.520
it'll,
it'll just whatever.
So I'm like,
okay,
I do it.

1671
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:37.260
And it took me four times,

1672
01:39:37.261 --> 01:39:40.050
how my fourth time I did it for the first time in my life.
By the way,

1673
01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:44.400
their crossover with the painful speed rope,
some,

1674
01:39:44.690 --> 01:39:49.350
some mental fortitude,
right?
They're throwing in so hardcore.
I did it.

1675
01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:54.360
You should've seen them,
but you should've seen the look on her end,

1676
01:39:54.361 --> 01:39:57.720
my daughter's face.
They were like,
oh.
Like it was,
you know,

1677
01:39:57.990 --> 01:40:02.430
like I just got my purple belt of something nonetheless.
So boom,

1678
01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:05.580
what do we have right there?
This situation,
this is what I took from it too.

1679
01:40:06.690 --> 01:40:10.650
We have a situation,
a full grown athletic,

1680
01:40:10.651 --> 01:40:15.651
arguably person learning to do something that's really not that easy.

1681
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:18.240
Obviously,
if I've never done it in my life,

1682
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:23.760
learning to do something that takes a fair amount of skill from a 12 year old

1683
01:40:23.761 --> 01:40:25.830
girl in real time.

1684
01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.270
And you know what I did
to boot gave her the credit.

1685
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:38.190
I said,
Dang,
you are the the best teacher.
Yes,

1686
01:40:38.191 --> 01:40:41.820
exactly right.
So that's the thing,
the moral of your story,

1687
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:44.610
which was a long story.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Be Humble.

1688
01:40:44.730 --> 01:40:48.300
You can learn from anybody and when you do learn from someone,
boom.

1689
01:40:48.301 --> 01:40:51.150
That's what I did.
See,
I said that in 13 seconds.
I know brow,

1690
01:40:51.151 --> 01:40:55.210
but I'm just saying it was impactful and it reminded me of that story.
Anyway,

1691
01:40:55.270 --> 01:41:00.190
next question.
Jocko.
Just checked out.
Podcast 21 with Tim Kennedy.
Awesome.

1692
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.440
Raise the big time question though.

1693
01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:07.500
You and Tim agreed that cops who make controversial decisions slash mistakes do

1694
01:41:07.751 --> 01:41:11.860
so simply because they're not trained well enough.
That begs the question,

1695
01:41:11.861 --> 01:41:16.030
how much does the environment,
someone trains in impact their decision making?

1696
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:20.050
How much tactical decision making is innate versus learned?

1697
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:22.770
Could killing the ideology that,

1698
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:28.420
that the insurgents buy into be better than killing insurgents or can they

1699
01:41:28.421 --> 01:41:32.080
simply not be reasoned with at any level?

1700
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:35.680
There have been terrorist who flee their organizations and start new,

1701
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:38.260
peaceful lives in other locations.

1702
01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:42.510
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,
yes.
So the first part of the question,
yes,</v>

1703
01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:46.580
you train how you fight and the more you train the morgue,

1704
01:41:46.581 --> 01:41:49.830
you reprogram your instincts.
So that's important.

1705
01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:54.630
You're reprogramming your instincts when you train and you get better instincts.

1706
01:41:55.110 --> 01:41:58.190
So that's what you do.
And,

1707
01:41:58.210 --> 01:42:01.500
and now when cops make mistakes,

1708
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:06.060
oftentimes it's because of their lack of training.

1709
01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:08.550
Sometimes they make a mistake.

1710
01:42:09.150 --> 01:42:13.170
That is a mistake that got made.
You know it's,
it's a mistake.

1711
01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.780
That's all it is and they've been trained well and they still make a mistake.

1712
01:42:15.781 --> 01:42:19.320
I'm going to tell you the percentage of mistakes go down dramatically.

1713
01:42:19.321 --> 01:42:20.730
The more that you train in,

1714
01:42:20.731 --> 01:42:23.340
the more realistically trained and the more often you train,

1715
01:42:23.610 --> 01:42:28.110
you're going to get better.
No doubt about it.
But that's like an instinct.

1716
01:42:28.111 --> 01:42:30.930
You're training your instinct.
So that's so one thing,
this,

1717
01:42:31.290 --> 01:42:36.290
this idea that we could just attack an ideology of terrorists and then have some

1718
01:42:39.301 --> 01:42:40.140
of them convert.

1719
01:42:40.141 --> 01:42:43.650
That'd be a wonderful thing that you attack the ideology and then some of them

1720
01:42:43.651 --> 01:42:45.720
become peaceful,
productive members of society.

1721
01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:50.190
And if we did it like a full court press to try and make this happen,

1722
01:42:50.191 --> 01:42:51.210
we might be able to convert,

1723
01:42:52.530 --> 01:42:57.120
let's say we were really successful and be able to convert five or 10% a year.

1724
01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:00.470
Okay,
so that's great.

1725
01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:04.070
Then you have to remember that the enemy is also out there converting people,

1726
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:07.670
right?
Probably at at least equal rate,

1727
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:09.590
maybe even a little bit higher.

1728
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:16.030
So we still end up losing the fight cause to break even is to loose cause

1729
01:43:16.701 --> 01:43:21.230
they're still out there doing what they're doing,
the Dow.
Um,
and in the meantime,

1730
01:43:21.231 --> 01:43:22.220
by the way,
there still

1731
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:28.800
gaining territory or causing terror.
So it's not a good situation.

1732
01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.020
Now the examples that I use all the time obviously are Nazi Germany and imperial

1733
01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:34.890
Japan.

1734
01:43:34.890 --> 01:43:39.890
Both of those groups were like the current day jihadists they were looking to

1735
01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:42.924
take over the world.

1736
01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:48.090
And if we just tried to kill their ideas with our ideas,

1737
01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:52.340
we would be speaking German right now because we would not,

1738
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:57.320
we couldn't have changed their ideas fast enough.
And by the way,

1739
01:43:57.590 --> 01:44:00.770
they were playing a different game.
If we were playing the game of let's chat,

1740
01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:05.750
exchange ideas,
the enemy is playing a different game.
So for instance,

1741
01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:11.560
if someone is trying to assault you and you're a pacifist and so you decide that

1742
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:16.940
you're going to try and convince them of the virtues of nonviolence through,

1743
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:22.510
through debate and the Socratic method and critical analysis and the use of

1744
01:44:22.521 --> 01:44:25.550
various rhetorical devices and that's what you're going to do.

1745
01:44:25.551 --> 01:44:28.640
And you might be the best debater in the entire world,

1746
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:30.370
<v 3>okay?</v>

1747
01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:33.130
<v 0>But none of those things are going to stop that assault her from punching you in</v>

1748
01:44:33.131 --> 01:44:36.430
the face.
He's playing a different game and once you're on the ground,

1749
01:44:36.431 --> 01:44:39.790
he's going to start kicking you.
He's a violent person.
Now,

1750
01:44:39.791 --> 01:44:43.720
maybe if you were to be able to slow him down long enough to try and reason with

1751
01:44:43.721 --> 01:44:47.500
them,
he's not playing that game though.
He's there to attack you.

1752
01:44:47.770 --> 01:44:52.770
He's there to stab you so your ideas aren't going to defeat his ideas.

1753
01:44:52.811 --> 01:44:55.210
You don't have the opportunity to do that.

1754
01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.880
He's not playing debate.

1755
01:44:59.590 --> 01:45:02.110
So you have to know how to fight.

1756
01:45:02.230 --> 01:45:05.740
You have to understand a violence and you have to be prepared to use it.

1757
01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:10.450
And if you can,
if you can debate and you can win,
that's awesome.

1758
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:12.270
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1759
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:14.220
<v 0>that's awesome.
But if it doesn't work,</v>

1760
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:19.200
you need to be prepared to use violence as it's needed.

1761
01:45:19.201 --> 01:45:22.440
And it's the same thing on a larger scale.
Obviously we,

1762
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.180
we can do everything we can to try and help snuff out this extremist ideology.

1763
01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:31.260
Let's prop up reformist as much as we can.

1764
01:45:31.261 --> 01:45:35.850
Let's try and bring economic opportunities to these improv rushed in and

1765
01:45:35.851 --> 01:45:40.851
deprived regions so that they're less likely to come under the psychological

1766
01:45:41.911 --> 01:45:43.680
grips of a death cult.

1767
01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:48.540
But at the same time that we're doing those procedures,

1768
01:45:48.541 --> 01:45:51.390
let's attack their strongest a factories of hate.

1769
01:45:52.530 --> 01:45:57.240
Let's go after their centers of gravity and let's snuff out and destroy those

1770
01:45:57.570 --> 01:46:02.570
individuals that clearly have no hope of reform and exist only to spread this

1771
01:46:05.611 --> 01:46:10.200
cancer of hate and violence and terror and death.

1772
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:16.700
And if we attack on both those fronts,

1773
01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:22.960
hopefully one day where we can live in a world where we can solve problems,

1774
01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:31.060
not with physical force but with our intellectual power and that would be great.

1775
01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:33.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1776
01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:33.881
<v 0>And unfortunately,</v>

1777
01:46:33.881 --> 01:46:37.960
I don't think that day will ever come because there's always going to be someone

1778
01:46:37.961 --> 01:46:42.961
out there that's going to attack you regardless of your debating skills

1779
01:46:46.450 --> 01:46:47.283
and math.

1780
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:55.140
<v 2>Next question.
Yeah.
Long question here.
Yeah.</v>

1781
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:58.980
My general question is,

1782
01:46:59.190 --> 01:47:02.940
is there a point where it's no longer physically realistic to train Jujitsu?

1783
01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:07.350
Big Jujitsu today on the podcast?
Yeah,
Jujitsu heavy Jujitsu.
I'm okay.

1784
01:47:07.730 --> 01:47:11.160
Actually,
I noticed we were going back to Jujitsu a lot.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1785
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:13.680
We took some questions that weren't about Jujitsu.

1786
01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:17.240
We turned them into Jiu Jitsu questions.
Sometimes.
Yeah,

1787
01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:23.640
I'm a former competitive athlete but have experienced various injuries that I

1788
01:47:23.641 --> 01:47:27.000
still work through on a daily basis.
I really want to get into Jujitsu,

1789
01:47:27.001 --> 01:47:31.440
but my only hesitation on my lingering injuries,
I don't know anyone who trains,

1790
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:36.090
so I don't have any sense of how much is too much when it comes to physical

1791
01:47:36.091 --> 01:47:37.200
limitations and injuries.

1792
01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.290
I'm sure you must have had injuries over the years that hindered your training.

1793
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:44.850
Were you able to modify your training to accommodate them them?

1794
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:46.980
Although I have no experience,

1795
01:47:46.981 --> 01:47:51.420
I greatly respect the martial arts and the last thing that I would want to do is

1796
01:47:51.421 --> 01:47:54.390
waste the instructor or other students' time by not being able to fully

1797
01:47:54.391 --> 01:47:56.730
participate and or holding up the class.

1798
01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:00.750
I hope this question can benefit other podcasts listeners who may be wondering

1799
01:48:00.751 --> 01:48:03.360
the same thing.
However,
to give you the,

1800
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:06.060
give you full detail in reference to the question,

1801
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:11.270
I'm 26 and the injuries I'm dealing with are just the list left knee that I need

1802
01:48:12.661 --> 01:48:16.350
to work on daily to maintain full range of motion on my third ACL.

1803
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:21.350
Meaning he had surgery three times.
Well yeah,
he's had three actually.

1804
01:48:21.351 --> 01:48:25.050
He said he had heard surgery seven times but that's his third ACL ACL surgery.

1805
01:48:25.051 --> 01:48:28.030
Oh yeah.
Sort of ligament been put in there.
Dang.

1806
01:48:28.031 --> 01:48:29.880
Yeah cause they replaced the ligament.
Yes.

1807
01:48:29.881 --> 01:48:31.050
It doesn't grow back and it doesn't heal.

1808
01:48:31.051 --> 01:48:34.560
So they got to give you a cadaver or they either give you your own from your hip

1809
01:48:34.561 --> 01:48:39.120
or your from your head or hamstring or Patella string and they put that in there

1810
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:41.700
or they give you a cadaver one.
Yeah,
I had that.

1811
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:46.410
I had ACL back in the cadaver my own from my hamstring.

1812
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:50.850
Okay.
I've had said at seven surgeon,
well I haven't this back to the question.

1813
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:55.190
I've had seven surgeries,
most recent being a fee moral oss,

1814
01:48:55.450 --> 01:48:59.970
the autonomy and cadaver meniscus transplant.
There you go.

1815
01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:03.780
I'm told one more major injury to the joint and I'm looking at a full knee

1816
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:07.950
replacement.
Dang.
At 26 to less shoulder,
dislocated several times.

1817
01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.900
Torn ligament cartilage and label them.

1818
01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.480
Don't plan on having the surgery anytime soon.

1819
01:49:12.570 --> 01:49:17.370
And history and a history of multiple concussions.
I power lift,

1820
01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.200
jog,
metcon.
Hell yeah.
Regularly.
But all cutting sports.

1821
01:49:23.670 --> 01:49:26.160
But all cutting sports are pretty much out of the question.

1822
01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:29.280
Cutting all the sports.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Gotcha.
Nope,
he says,

1823
01:49:29.281 --> 01:49:34.080
but all cutting sports are pretty much meaning cutting yo when you know when you

1824
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:37.770
caught on the field.
Oh,
cutting.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Cutting left.
Cutting.
Right.

1825
01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:39.690
I'm pretty sure that's what he means.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.

1826
01:49:39.691 --> 01:49:43.830
I thought he meant you can jog.
He can do Matt Kahn's but he can't cut.
Gotcha.

1827
01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:49.150
Check.
Okay.
Either way,
I get,
I got you.
Um,
sports are pretty much on the question.

1828
01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:51.070
If Jujitsu isn't feasible,

1829
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:54.790
do you recommend any other martial art that would better fit my situation?

1830
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:58.660
Just getting tired of only tr trying to stay physically fit and would rather

1831
01:49:58.661 --> 01:50:00.790
incorporate a beneficial skill into my training.

1832
01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.380
Or is this all in my head and I should stop worrying and just get after it.

1833
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:08.110
Thank you for any advice you can offer a podcast.
Thank you for your service.

1834
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:09.830
Awesome.
Um,

1835
01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:13.020
<v 0>so I kind of broke these out was,
let me,
let me break these out of here.</v>

1836
01:50:13.021 --> 01:50:14.190
So his first general question,

1837
01:50:14.191 --> 01:50:17.050
is there a point where it's no longer physically realistic to train Jujitsu?

1838
01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.050
And the answer that really is yes.

1839
01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:24.140
But you can also train Jujitsu in a wide variety of levels of intensity of very

1840
01:50:24.961 --> 01:50:28.170
wide.
You could theoretically just go and learn the techniques.

1841
01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:32.250
You could just learn the techniques and never actually rolled to someone.

1842
01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:37.440
And if you couldn't do anything at all that would,

1843
01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:41.340
in my opinion,
I would still do that.
Yeah.
Just to,
just to know and understand it.

1844
01:50:41.341 --> 01:50:43.560
I would still do that.
Would you agree?
Yes.

1845
01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.920
And it now what you have to be watch out for is that you're going to want to try

1846
01:50:50.971 --> 01:50:54.210
them.
Yeah.
You're going to want to try it.
And it's so unreal and that's just,

1847
01:50:54.450 --> 01:50:58.410
that's what you're going to need,
want to do.
Now,
you know,
like I said,

1848
01:50:58.411 --> 01:51:00.750
you can do it from just from just learning the techniques,

1849
01:51:00.751 --> 01:51:05.370
only two all the way to competing in Jiu Jitsu.
And like I said,

1850
01:51:05.371 --> 01:51:06.330
you got to watch out that you,

1851
01:51:06.331 --> 01:51:09.990
if you can only learn them and maybe you can row light,

1852
01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:13.800
maybe you can find,
you can roll with light.
People are,

1853
01:51:13.801 --> 01:51:18.690
you can roll with really good brown belts that are light and that,

1854
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:22.900
that use tell him,
you know,
up front,
hey,
I got injuries.
I'm not here to,

1855
01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:24.810
for an ego trip,
I just want to try the moves.

1856
01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:27.480
You better freaking keep your ego in check though,

1857
01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:30.940
which is what's so hard because you're going to think,

1858
01:51:30.941 --> 01:51:33.600
well this guy's kind of skinny dude,
get out of this.

1859
01:51:33.601 --> 01:51:36.120
And then you end up getting hurt.
So you can't let that happen.

1860
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:38.610
So don't let your ego get in the way you might not want.

1861
01:51:38.610 --> 01:51:41.160
If you have all those series injuries like it sounds like you have,

1862
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:44.610
you may not want to roll with anybody for a long time until you really truly

1863
01:51:44.611 --> 01:51:48.570
understand Jujitsu.
So that's question number one.
Yes,

1864
01:51:48.571 --> 01:51:52.200
you can learn it without much risk.
Actually,

1865
01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.250
you're very limited risk if you're just looking to learn the techniques,

1866
01:51:56.251 --> 01:52:00.720
you could learn it with very limited risk.
Um,
now the next question,

1867
01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.040
have I had injuries over the years and was I able to modify my training to

1868
01:52:05.041 --> 01:52:06.480
accommodate them?
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1869
01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:11.400
I've had ankle sprained ankles,
high sprains,
all that stuff.

1870
01:52:11.401 --> 01:52:12.450
And when that happens,

1871
01:52:12.451 --> 01:52:15.630
you see me training my bottom game a bunch because I'm not going to be on top.

1872
01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:19.740
I hurt my back one time really bad and I couldn't do an Oba.

1873
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:23.130
This is what I was a blue belt,
couldn't do an Oompah,
couldn't do it.
Guess what?

1874
01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:27.540
I did elbow scraped.
My elbow scape got good because I could not do an Oba.
Uh,

1875
01:52:27.570 --> 01:52:32.130
I've had my MCL 80% tear,

1876
01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.760
get some guess what?
No factor.
Put It on and I,

1877
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:37.200
I couldn't train for like a couple of weeks,

1878
01:52:37.201 --> 01:52:41.250
but then I put it on one of those hinged metal braces.
Strap that thing on tight.

1879
01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:45.000
Could I do closed guard?
No.
Could I do a triangle on someone?
Know,

1880
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:49.550
did I have to be careful?
Yes.
Did I train?
Absolutely.
Uh,

1881
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:54.830
my neck.
I had neck surgery and you know,
my neck now does it hurt?
Yeah,

1882
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:57.680
go.
I end my whole game

1883
01:52:59.210 --> 01:53:01.910
is kind of based fundamentally around protecting my neck.

1884
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:06.380
So I don't do certain moves that I used to do that work that are high risk neck

1885
01:53:06.381 --> 01:53:10.640
moves.
Interesting.
Right?
Like uh,
yeah,

1886
01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:13.490
there's just certain moves that I just don't do anymore because it's high risk

1887
01:53:13.491 --> 01:53:17.900
neck move and I don't want to put my neck into just into jeopardy.
So yes,

1888
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:22.780
you do go through things now occasionally,
like I just got through,
uh,

1889
01:53:23.570 --> 01:53:28.570
a few weeks where I had three simultaneous injuries and it was a broken knuckle,

1890
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.910
uh,

1891
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:39.910
some kind of a knee issue and I had a gaping cut on my toe,

1892
01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:45.090
my big toe,
ripped half the skin off the monitor itself.

1893
01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:48.320
And so I said to myself,
okay,

1894
01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:51.740
I'll just tape up my entire body and still train.
No,
I didn't say that.
I said,

1895
01:53:51.741 --> 01:53:56.540
you know what,
this is,
you know,
my body telling me,
you know,

1896
01:53:56.541 --> 01:54:00.290
one injury you can get through two injuries.
Okay,
wait a second.

1897
01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:04.070
But when I finally tore my toe open,
I was like,
okay,

1898
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:06.980
maybe it's time to take some time away from the mat.

1899
01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:11.630
So I didn't train for a few weeks.
Right.
Probably the longest.

1900
01:54:11.631 --> 01:54:14.400
I haven't trained in in it since.
I can't remember.
Uh,

1901
01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:17.330
but that's three injury stacked on top of one another.

1902
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:20.900
And now I'm just thinking myself.
You gotta be kidding me.
Let them all heal.

1903
01:54:21.110 --> 01:54:24.920
And that's what I did.
Uh,
so that's that.

1904
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:29.150
The next sort of question was,
if Jujitsu isn't feasible,

1905
01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:32.450
do you recommend any other martial art that would be better fit your situation?

1906
01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:36.800
I think you can always learn Jujitsu.
I think you could learn to box.
Um,

1907
01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:39.900
you could learn more.
[inaudible] you gotta be careful.
Be careful with more.

1908
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.790
You got the knee surgeries you got,

1909
01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.590
I would say little to no sparring since you've had concussions.
Uh,

1910
01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:48.710
and like I said,
in all those cases,
you're going to learn to box and you're like,

1911
01:54:48.711 --> 01:54:50.240
well,
I don't think I want to try this out,
man.

1912
01:54:50.290 --> 01:54:54.500
Who looks pretty easy and that's powering ring.
I'm going to get in there.
Don't,

1913
01:54:54.650 --> 01:54:59.270
you've already have concussions.
You can't,
you got to keep your ego in check.

1914
01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:02.090
And then the last part of the question was,

1915
01:55:02.091 --> 01:55:06.710
or is this all in my head and I should just stop worrying and get after it.
Look,

1916
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:08.990
we all have got to know our limitations.

1917
01:55:08.991 --> 01:55:13.070
You got to also know that sometimes you're putting limitations on yourself that

1918
01:55:13.071 --> 01:55:13.904
are too tight.

1919
01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:18.320
And you also got to realize that sometimes you can push yourself too hard and

1920
01:55:18.321 --> 01:55:22.640
overdo it and end up in a really rough spot where you've got a permanent injury.

1921
01:55:22.641 --> 01:55:23.301
Like,
you know,

1922
01:55:23.301 --> 01:55:28.301
right now my knee is not fully healed and so instead of doing nine rounds of

1923
01:55:29.751 --> 01:55:33.890
Jujitsu,
I did like four yesterday,
five yesterday,

1924
01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:38.660
five today,
you know,
not and,
and avoiding a couple of positions.

1925
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:42.200
Right.
You know,
that's what I'm doing.
Yeah.
That's okay.
I can't go in there.

1926
01:55:42.210 --> 01:55:44.040
It happened the big and be like I'm

1927
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.320
<v 1>going to be on top right now.
No,
can't do it.</v>

1928
01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:50.640
And the more impactful part is it can't have the big ego of like somebody comes

1929
01:55:50.641 --> 01:55:52.650
up with like,
hey,
let's roll.
Right?
Like,
okay,

1930
01:55:52.651 --> 01:55:55.200
I'll roll with you cause I don't want to look like a Wuss.
No,
no,

1931
01:55:55.201 --> 01:55:58.650
actually I got an injured knee can roll right now,
which I hate saying.

1932
01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.720
I guess by saying that,
I despise saying that I despise it,

1933
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:08.880
but I know that I,
you know,
I got to heal up.
Yeah,
man.

1934
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.720
So part of the game.
Yeah,
that's the ego in check.

1935
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:15.360
But remembered Jerry Loudon.
Yeah.

1936
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:20.430
So he had jammed up knees and I'd thought of him while I'm reading this case

1937
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:25.200
question.
Yup.
Same Age maybe,
I don't know.
Do you ever do any,
might've been older.

1938
01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:29.910
Maybe like 32 or something.
Yeah.
So jammed up nice.
But you know,

1939
01:56:29.911 --> 01:56:34.320
he did some guy,
so he comes in and what he'd always do is he'd be like,
Hey,

1940
01:56:34.321 --> 01:56:37.800
let's,
he'd grabbed me because I've known him long time.
[inaudible]
he,
uh,

1941
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:40.110
he'd be like,
Hey,
let's he what he called it youth.
He's like,
Hey,

1942
01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:43.800
do you want to play?
Meaning?
Like,
we're just,
we're just rolling.
You know,

1943
01:56:43.801 --> 01:56:46.800
just like how you said,
how you like,
how I warm up with Andy.

1944
01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:51.480
He's big and he's really good for that to history.
Now Dean is not good for that.

1945
01:56:52.410 --> 01:56:54.720
Yes,
it all roll.
Dean Dean will literally say to me,
Hey,

1946
01:56:54.721 --> 01:56:57.730
let's just get warmed up and then he'll get across side and smashed me for,

1947
01:56:57.731 --> 01:57:01.770
for for four minutes and 38 seconds and torture me.

1948
01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:05.130
So I do not do warm up rounds with Dean Dean.
Wait,

1949
01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:07.350
if you can go to hell no one around you here.

1950
01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:11.940
Obviously Dean does that on purpose.
Like because we're going to do that.

1951
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:15.420
You wouldn't,
we do that.
Dean has two advantages.
Number one,

1952
01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:20.850
I'm not warm and that means there's no sweat yet.
So He's,

1953
01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:21.420
so there's,

1954
01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:26.420
there's like just friction and he can just secure positions and it sucks.

1955
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:31.800
And,
and psychologically we both,
oh and the other,

1956
01:57:31.801 --> 01:57:35.250
the other advantage that he has is he's fresh because the deeper we go into deep

1957
01:57:35.251 --> 01:57:38.640
waters,
the better I'm doing because I'm in better condition than him.

1958
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:41.940
I did get mad,
but he has those two advantages out of the gate.

1959
01:57:42.450 --> 01:57:44.440
He's going to make me pay.
So flooding.

1960
01:57:44.441 --> 01:57:49.080
You can tell him it's not like a little thing with a 20 something year thing

1961
01:57:49.081 --> 01:57:53.280
with dean.
Hey Man,
I dig it and that's probably going to continue to,
you know,

1962
01:57:53.281 --> 01:57:55.710
till you guys are both kind of,
we just had an incident yesterday,

1963
01:57:56.520 --> 01:58:01.420
man incident yesterday happened.
You know Ted talk about it.
No,
I already did.

1964
01:58:01.421 --> 01:58:05.580
Her words were exchanged loudly in the gym anyway.

1965
01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:08.670
Jerry is really good with that.

1966
01:58:08.671 --> 01:58:13.430
Where this is the guy and this guy situation more or less me wise anyway.
And um,

1967
01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:16.080
I think it was even both his knees.
Yeah it was,
you know,

1968
01:58:16.081 --> 01:58:20.340
so you can do that and you can get like a good movement.
Good Rolling.

1969
01:58:21.150 --> 01:58:22.770
Without that,
that impact,

1970
01:58:22.771 --> 01:58:25.770
you know when every once in a while you got to turn up the heat or whatever on a

1971
01:58:25.771 --> 01:58:27.780
guy.
Cause that comes from Eagle.
Yeah.

1972
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:31.440
It's more of like this competitive kind of spirit of rolling Jujitsu.

1973
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.350
That's kind of what it is.
So if you can avoid that,

1974
01:58:34.351 --> 01:58:37.470
you've got to actively avoided and still get that movement.

1975
01:58:37.471 --> 01:58:40.890
If you can find the right person and you can go and you can go,
you can learn,

1976
01:58:40.891 --> 01:58:42.040
you get more

1977
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.780
<v 0>or less live situations,
but you just can't be like,</v>

1978
01:58:44.890 --> 01:58:49.190
you can't find that little fight in the fight.
You,
you gotta let that go.
Okay,

1979
01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:53.860
I get great.
But yeah,
you can learn for sure.
You can learn,
don't do take downs.

1980
01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:57.480
If you've got a nice situation,
don't do take down,
take down situation.
That's,

1981
01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:02.290
that's going to be hard.
All right.
Okay.

1982
01:59:02.291 --> 01:59:06.250
Last question.
And you know this,
this last question,

1983
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:11.380
it's not really a question.
What would it look?

1984
01:59:11.381 --> 01:59:16.381
I get a lot of awesome emails and I get emails from people that have completely

1985
01:59:18.850 --> 01:59:23.590
turned
their lives around.
They've,
they've lost weight.

1986
01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:26.920
If they needed to lose weight or they've gained weight because they needed to

1987
01:59:26.921 --> 01:59:31.921
gain weight or they've gotten promoted or they've become a better parent or they

1988
01:59:33.071 --> 01:59:36.040
become a better spouse or they'd become a better kid.
Yeah.

1989
01:59:38.090 --> 01:59:43.090
And I get emails from people that have quit their addictions or they've,

1990
01:59:43.161 --> 01:59:47.090
or they've overcome their fear and I say what?

1991
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:52.390
I get letters and packages and notes about all this kind of stuff,

1992
01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.830
then it's awesome.
I get,

1993
01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:59.920
I get people send me books for the podcast and pictures and drawings and,

1994
02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:02.450
and,

1995
02:00:02.450 --> 02:00:07.450
and military memorabilia or unit patches and coins from police departments and

1996
02:00:10.911 --> 02:00:14.270
fire departments and,
and military units is just,

1997
02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:19.880
it's awesome.
And,
and I,
um,

1998
02:00:21.190 --> 02:00:23.980
I'm so thankful for all that feedback

1999
02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:30.550
and it,
it drives me bad feedback that I get,

2000
02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:35.940
drives me to work hard and keep pushing to do this to the best of my ability and

2001
02:00:39.581 --> 02:00:40.540
try and get better at it.

2002
02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:47.640
But,
you know,
I,

2003
02:00:47.641 --> 02:00:52.641
I hear from people that have used the podcast and the discipline and the,

2004
02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:54.060
the,

2005
02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:59.060
the mindset of looking at things that are problematic as being good.

2006
02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:06.540
I hear from people that have used those things to overcome,

2007
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:12.070
you know,
dark patches yeah.
In their lives,
you know,

2008
02:01:12.071 --> 02:01:17.071
whether it's depression or anxiety or even like full fledged despair.

2009
02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:23.790
And again,
when you hear from people that are turned that corner,

2010
02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:27.810
that's just incredibly rewarding.

2011
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2012
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:31.130
<v 0>To know that there's,
you know,</v>

2013
02:01:31.131 --> 02:01:34.430
there's people out there that are really changing for the better and turning

2014
02:01:34.431 --> 02:01:38.000
their lives from negative.

2015
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.530
<v 3>Okay to positive.</v>

2016
02:01:41.670 --> 02:01:45.330
<v 0>It's unbelievably rewarding.</v>

2017
02:01:49.390 --> 02:01:50.620
But I also get

2018
02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:56.830
some other emails and I get some other messages

2019
02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:01.940
from people that haven't been able

2020
02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:08.830
to dig out of that hole to overcome that,

2021
02:02:10.150 --> 02:02:13.270
that despair.
I,

2022
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:17.610
I hear from people sometimes that feel there's nowhere,

2023
02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:19.590
nowhere else to go.
There's no way out

2024
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:22.950
and they don't have any more options

2025
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:30.440
and they are considering

2026
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:37.340
taking the only way out that they can see.

2027
02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:39.740
And that is they want to take their own life.

2028
02:02:46.050 --> 02:02:46.883
And

2029
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:54.680
to anybody out there that's in that place,

2030
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.823
<v 3>you know,</v>

2031
02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:06.040
<v 0>I don't really know what exactly to tell you,</v>

2032
02:03:08.770 --> 02:03:13.270
but I can kind of tell you what I think.

2033
02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:19.130
I think.
No,

2034
02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:24.120
I think,
no,

2035
02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:29.360
I think don't save that last bullet for yourself.

2036
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.590
Don't save it for yourself.

2037
02:03:32.650 --> 02:03:37.650
You lock and load that last bullet and you shoot it at your enemy

2038
02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:44.700
and when you're out of bullets,
get out your knife and attack would that.

2039
02:03:47.730 --> 02:03:49.170
And if you lose your knife,

2040
02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:53.880
you grab your enemy by the fruit.

2041
02:03:53.881 --> 02:03:54.930
And You keep fighting

2042
02:03:57.190 --> 02:04:02.190
and you keep fighting and you keep fighting and you keep fighting no matter what

2043
02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:12.300
and you never quit.
Never,

2044
02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:14.770
never quit.

2045
02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:16.133
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2046
02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:23.140
<v 0>And if you feel like your wife is in a place where you can't get any lower</v>

2047
02:04:25.690 --> 02:04:30.550
and you don't think you can find any way out,

2048
02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:33.333
<v 3>good</v>

2049
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:40.560
<v 0>cause that means the ultimate challenge is ahead of you.</v>

2050
02:04:40.561 --> 02:04:42.330
It means you can only go up.

2051
02:04:45.670 --> 02:04:46.503
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2052
02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:51.230
<v 0>And it also means that things are going to be tough.</v>

2053
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:53.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2054
02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:58.220
<v 0>Things are going to be tougher than anything you can imagine.</v>

2055
02:04:58.670 --> 02:05:02.630
But that storm that you're in from,

2056
02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:04.400
from your perspective,

2057
02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:11.460
it seems like that storm is enveloping the whole world.

2058
02:05:15.250 --> 02:05:17.890
But I'm telling you,
it is not

2059
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:24.260
the storm that urine.

2060
02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:28.850
It is hard to see out of that storm.
It's a hard to see past it.

2061
02:05:28.851 --> 02:05:32.270
It seems like the storm,
it seems like a storm is everything

2062
02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:37.400
<v 3>okay?</v>

2063
02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.890
<v 0>But the storm is not everything.</v>

2064
02:05:42.850 --> 02:05:45.560
Andy old won't last forever.

2065
02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:55.520
You can get out of the storm and you will get out of the storm and when you get

2066
02:05:58.231 --> 02:05:59.064
out,

2067
02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:04.290
you're going to see this sauna.

2068
02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:06.733
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2069
02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:14.560
<v 0>But right now you're being tried.</v>

2070
02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:16.510
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2071
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:18.220
<v 0>You're being forge.</v>

2072
02:06:18.430 --> 02:06:23.430
You're being tested by fire and by pain.

2073
02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:28.570
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2074
02:06:28.570 --> 02:06:29.560
<v 0>That's the test.</v>

2075
02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:35.570
Don't fail the test.

2076
02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:43.430
Don't fail the test.
Don't give in.
Don't quit.

2077
02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:48.433
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2078
02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:52.790
<v 0>Don't ever quit.
Fight on</v>

2079
02:06:54.650 --> 02:06:55.760
fight through the storm.

2080
02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:01.910
Fight through the pain and come out the other side.

2081
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.830
Stronger and tougher and better.

2082
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:14.083
<v 3>A fighter.</v>

2083
02:07:17.290 --> 02:07:21.900
<v 0>A survivor.
Oh,</v>

2084
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:22.743
winter.

2085
02:07:25.890 --> 02:07:26.723
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2086
02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:29.010
<v 0>Victorious</v>

2087
02:07:32.410 --> 02:07:33.243
and

2088
02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:37.560
<v 2>free from that storm.</v>

2089
02:07:41.530 --> 02:07:44.170
Free from the darkness

2090
02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:50.833
free.

2091
02:07:59.850 --> 02:08:01.030
And I think that's

2092
02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:06.700
all I've got for tonight.

2093
02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:13.440
So
Echo Charles,

2094
02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:16.140
speaking of

2095
02:08:19.930 --> 02:08:23.910
being stronger and being better.
Yeah.

2096
02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:28.630
Maybe you could tell us some ways to

2097
02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:34.690
make ourselves a little stronger and a little better.
Yeah.
And at the same time,

2098
02:08:34.930 --> 02:08:38.890
sure.
Possibly support this podcast if they want to.
Yes.

2099
02:08:39.190 --> 02:08:41.470
You're under no obligation to support yourself.
Well,

2100
02:08:41.710 --> 02:08:45.640
I think as a human being you are,
but I'm just saying as far as the message here,

2101
02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:51.060
that's up to you.
But if you do want to,
what?

2102
02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:55.900
Pursue whatever you want to pursue,
your participation is required.

2103
02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.870
Does that make sense?
No.
Okay.
Anyway,

2104
02:09:00.130 --> 02:09:05.110
so I'm going to talk about on it.
So good fitness gear.
Good stuff.

2105
02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:09.580
I just got some fulvic minerals.
Hmm.
It's actually from that way.

2106
02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.710
Nonetheless.
They got some good stuff for any,
uh,

2107
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:17.910
area of getting after it that you need to or that you want supplementation with.

2108
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:21.260
So remember that jump rope story I told him right?

2109
02:09:23.110 --> 02:09:26.950
That wasn't on at jump rope.
Oh,
they're young.
Yeah.
Pro speed rope,

2110
02:09:26.951 --> 02:09:28.150
I think it's called.
It's like,
Bro,

2111
02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:32.990
there's a lot of technological advances in jump ropes back.
Yeah.

2112
02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.670
Back Elementary School for me.
Yeah.

2113
02:09:35.710 --> 02:09:39.010
He's just a piece of leather hide or what was mine like a row.

2114
02:09:39.011 --> 02:09:42.460
It was straight up a rope with a handle and another handle at the end.
That's it.

2115
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:47.410
This one has like a swivel and has a thing.
It has a police system.
I Dunno.
Maybe.

2116
02:09:47.411 --> 02:09:51.880
I Dunno what it's called.
It's made out of this stuff.
It's like,
yeah,
it's good.

2117
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:56.340
It's will's good.
Anyway.
Yeah,
that jumbo was good.
Um,
also kettlebells,

2118
02:09:57.970 --> 02:10:02.710
solid,
solid,
heavy,
heavy as you need varying weights.
Right.

2119
02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:07.120
I bought one for my daughter.
The,
what's the,
what is it?

2120
02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:09.410
The little monkeys Howler,
that's what it's called.

2121
02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:12.010
I think it's like 18 pounds or something like that.
She can lift it up.

2122
02:10:12.011 --> 02:10:14.660
She can't swing it.
She's for lifting it though,
right?
She's dead lifting it.

2123
02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:16.510
Good for me.
You'd be surprised,
man.

2124
02:10:16.511 --> 02:10:19.390
Little kids and my natural instinct for forming.
Exactly right.

2125
02:10:19.391 --> 02:10:22.270
Cause they're trying to find the perfect balance.
That's why they have no choice.

2126
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:26.500
They do off that and we're just going to fall down.
My son,
11 months old now,

2127
02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:27.970
she started walking at straight up.

2128
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:32.200
You'd kind of earlier than my other like nine almost 10 months.
That pour,
right?

2129
02:10:32.370 --> 02:10:34.040
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's to be outside.
That means he's

2130
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.430
<v 1>going to be an unbelievable athlete yourself repeating it.
Recruited right now.</v>

2131
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:39.620
That's what everybody thought.
That's what they say.

2132
02:10:39.710 --> 02:10:41.670
Everybody's kid is the best kid in the world.
Yeah.

2133
02:10:41.690 --> 02:10:44.630
That's what everybody thinks and by no means is that my message here,

2134
02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:49.580
but the message is you watch them do a squat to pick something out.
You're like,

2135
02:10:49.581 --> 02:10:52.310
Dang,
that's good for him.
So my daughter,

2136
02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:57.311
she's forced it picks up the the kettle bell little Holler and I'm like,

2137
02:10:58.070 --> 02:11:00.200
first I'm like,
oh shoot,
I don't know.
She should be picking it up.

2138
02:11:00.201 --> 02:11:00.950
She doesn't know what she's is.

2139
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:04.840
She picks it up as this perfect form deadlift form lakes.

2140
02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.810
When my youngest daughter was like six or seven,
I had her dead lifting

2141
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:12.540
pattern.
No,
no.

2142
02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:17.560
And I pushed her too hard and she was dead lifting and she liked our back.

2143
02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:22.610
Ah,
how old?
Like six or seven.
I mean she was just doing like double body weight

2144
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:30.790
but it was with kettlebells and so you're not going that low so it makes it a

2145
02:11:31.701 --> 02:11:32.534
little bit easier.

2146
02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:37.840
So I thought she was dead lifting and my son was in there too and I think my

2147
02:11:38.271 --> 02:11:42.370
other daughter,
we were all just getting afterwards.
Sure,
sure.
And you know,

2148
02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:43.700
so I'm like,
can you can do this,
you can do this.

2149
02:11:43.701 --> 02:11:46.520
And we're escalating weights and going heavier and heavier and finally we get to

2150
02:11:46.521 --> 02:11:50.150
like a pretty big way.
I forget what it was.
It might've been,
might've been

2151
02:11:51.770 --> 02:11:55.400
maybe the 32 kilogram or something like that comes up.

2152
02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:59.180
So she lifts it and like right as she gets almost the top,

2153
02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:01.070
she gets the look on her face and like,

2154
02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:05.990
like moves sharp and then s and then she like started to tear up.

2155
02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:07.340
She dropped,
she didn't drop it,

2156
02:12:07.341 --> 02:12:09.460
she put it back down and she started to tear up and she's like,

2157
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:13.170
I think something happened to me.
Baghdadi and I was like,
Oh God,

2158
02:12:13.171 --> 02:12:14.750
I'm the worst father ever.

2159
02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:19.040
Don't go with a heavy kettle bells for the kids or heavy dead lifting,

2160
02:12:19.230 --> 02:12:22.160
but they're not ready for it.
Yeah,
I'll go on record trade up and say,

2161
02:12:22.161 --> 02:12:26.930
don't buy kettle bells for your kids or program that you got sorted out for them

2162
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.290
and when they're four or 11 months or whatever,
wait till they're six.

2163
02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:35.590
I don't do it.
I bought the Kettlebell because when I go out there,

2164
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:41.840
that daughter dead lifting and like posted at one time people were all pumped

2165
02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:45.680
because it's pretty dope.
It's dope to see in a picture,
but man,

2166
02:12:45.681 --> 02:12:47.150
you can't get crazy with that.

2167
02:12:47.210 --> 02:12:51.620
I think if I'm lifting my kettle bells and they're cool,

2168
02:12:51.670 --> 02:12:54.320
they're the werewolf ones and you know all this stuff.
My daughter's out there,

2169
02:12:54.321 --> 02:12:56.600
she's cruising and she's watching.
She's like,
you know,
she obviously,

2170
02:12:56.601 --> 02:12:59.660
he let me try,
let me try it.
And she,
she wants,
she can't in the game.

2171
02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:03.560
I don't want her to pick up that where we'll fit.
We 62 pounds,
one of them.

2172
02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:09.350
You don't let her.
I don't,
I don't push her to put,
pick that up.

2173
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:13.550
No.
She'll grab it and try out.
She doesn't pick it up.
No,
it's too heavy for her,

2174
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:17.750
but she just wants to be like,
dad,
that's all it is.

2175
02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:20.900
So you got into the howler just has a little gift.
Do you know,
hey,

2176
02:13:20.901 --> 02:13:22.700
you got your own kettle bell.
You know how empowering that is.

2177
02:13:22.701 --> 02:13:26.690
I'm not saying that now.
Now let's lift Goodal bill's grow.
You're only for,

2178
02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:28.130
now you're on the pro.
It's not that.

2179
02:13:28.131 --> 02:13:30.440
It's for her to have her own little Kettlebell and beat,
you know,

2180
02:13:30.441 --> 02:13:32.010
it's like a cohesive thing,
you know?

2181
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:32.820
<v 2>No,
it's cool.</v>

2182
02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:36.890
Just like she likes to do pull ups but not really snap out of pullet routine.

2183
02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:40.600
She reads where your kid,
I read it to her and she sees me doing pull up.

2184
02:13:40.601 --> 02:13:41.490
She's like my turn,

2185
02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:45.660
I want to do pullups now when she's able to get on her own program or be more in

2186
02:13:45.661 --> 02:13:50.661
a position to facilitate a program imposed upon her as the case may be not too

2187
02:13:52.201 --> 02:13:54.890
early.
By the way,
she'll be familiar with pullups.

2188
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:58.350
She'll know the value of pullups plus dad does pull up,
so it's obviously cool,

2189
02:13:58.730 --> 02:13:59.980
you know,
and she's going to be down,

2190
02:14:00.010 --> 02:14:02.700
she's going to be kind of set for life in regards to pull ups,

2191
02:14:02.850 --> 02:14:07.500
kettle bells or whatever.
So I like salt back there.
Can you get those?
Oh,

2192
02:14:07.501 --> 02:14:10.950
the kettle balls on it.com with a jump rope or the jumper,

2193
02:14:10.951 --> 02:14:15.630
the jump ropes still nonetheless.
Don't,

2194
02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:20.500
I don't think actually,
I do think that those designer kettle bells,

2195
02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:22.490
those are kind of like the um,

2196
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:28.090
that's the kind of the pre Madonna one actually.
No.
Yeah,

2197
02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:32.070
that's a wrong word though.
Now I'm okay with it.
They're dope.
They're just good.

2198
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:33.330
Yeah.
You like them?

2199
02:14:33.450 --> 02:14:38.130
They're not like the hardcore dusty canon balls with handles your artistic,

2200
02:14:38.131 --> 02:14:41.130
not the ones I have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The ones I have.
Yeah.
They're not like that.

2201
02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:43.350
I got all the,
the decent ones,
but they are cool.

2202
02:14:45.150 --> 02:14:49.770
If you walk into a gym,
you know,
you go to the gym,

2203
02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:52.470
you're wherever and there's a bunch of kettle bells,
right?
And you're,

2204
02:14:52.471 --> 02:14:55.650
you're looking for a certain weight and let's say there's the werewolf ones and

2205
02:14:55.651 --> 02:14:59.670
then there's the regular ones.
Which ones are,
you can hear me.

2206
02:15:00.330 --> 02:15:02.550
Is this a serious question or just like a basic question?

2207
02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:08.490
What do you think I would use werewolf ones probably.
Well,

2208
02:15:08.910 --> 02:15:10.930
nonetheless,
I think they're cool.
And Go ahead,
check them out.

2209
02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.570
[inaudible] dot com slash Jocko that's where you get it.
Support yourself really.

2210
02:15:16.710 --> 02:15:20.550
And a sports.
This podcast also,
if you are into these books,

2211
02:15:20.551 --> 02:15:25.170
we didn't read any books,
but I mentioned a few books today.

2212
02:15:25.590 --> 02:15:28.800
Mentioned Hackworth books.
Yeah.
Emission Dick winters books.

2213
02:15:28.890 --> 02:15:32.810
Where can you find those books?
Well,
ultimately you get them from Amazon,

2214
02:15:32.811 --> 02:15:35.370
like everything else.
Um,
but if you want to go through the list,

2215
02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:37.560
the specific books,
go to the website Jocko,

2216
02:15:37.561 --> 02:15:42.561
podcast.com section on the top or menu item on the top boom cause you to the

2217
02:15:42.811 --> 02:15:45.000
page with all the books by episode.
By the way,

2218
02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:47.940
actually I don't think I put extreme ownership on there,

2219
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:51.900
but nonetheless click through there that's kind of jacked up.

2220
02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:56.040
Well actually exist over to the right,
so that's the thing.

2221
02:15:56.041 --> 02:15:59.040
Extreme ownership is covered it in the podcast,

2222
02:15:59.310 --> 02:16:02.280
so it's not going to be on the list of books covered either podcast because the

2223
02:16:02.281 --> 02:16:06.390
section is called books from the episodes unless maybe all of lay on and we'll

2224
02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:08.580
do extreme ownership.
Yeah,
that'd be cool.

2225
02:16:09.090 --> 02:16:12.660
That'd be like layers because you wrote the book,

2226
02:16:12.690 --> 02:16:14.980
you've experienced all the thing with life.

2227
02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:17.100
You do the audio book and now you're doing on the podcast,

2228
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:21.620
so it's like a the thing.
Anyway,
go do that.
Go to Jocko,

2229
02:16:21.621 --> 02:16:25.140
podcast.com boom.
Choose whatever book or books that you want.

2230
02:16:25.141 --> 02:16:29.740
Click through there to get them.
Boom.
Got You.
That's a good way to support.
Yup.

2231
02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:34.180
<v 1>Very good.
It's like I'm,
and it's what takes one,
one second,</v>

2232
02:16:34.181 --> 02:16:39.130
two seconds and big support,
small action.
Big reactions.

2233
02:16:40.270 --> 02:16:42.920
Just saying [inaudible] can we start what you're saying?
You know what,

2234
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.541
you know what I'm saying?

2235
02:16:43.541 --> 02:16:48.280
You understand also good with a support is to subscribe on Itunes,
stitcher,

2236
02:16:48.281 --> 02:16:51.760
Google play and all these other podcasting providing platforms.

2237
02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:55.810
Not to mention youtube.
If you liked the video format,

2238
02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:58.960
you want to see what Jocko looks like.
If you don't know already.
Uh,
you know,

2239
02:16:58.961 --> 02:17:00.220
I guess you can see what I looked like,

2240
02:17:00.221 --> 02:17:04.810
which I'm not saying to look at me to look at me because if you don't know what

2241
02:17:04.811 --> 02:17:06.820
echo looks like,
go look on Youtube.

2242
02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.470
You can see what it looks like cause he doesn't look like what you think he

2243
02:17:09.471 --> 02:17:11.980
looks like apparently.
Yeah.
Apparently evidence,

2244
02:17:12.010 --> 02:17:14.590
I've known him too long to understand the,

2245
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:18.610
what he appears to be via his voice.
Sure.

2246
02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.630
But apparently he doesn't sound like what he looks like,
so yeah,

2247
02:17:21.631 --> 02:17:23.050
you guys might want to check that out.
Yeah,

2248
02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:27.440
I guess they don't match my look and my voice,
apparently not.
But you know,

2249
02:17:27.460 --> 02:17:31.120
I live in a world where we're judged on the content of our character and the

2250
02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:34.060
contents of our hearts.
So,
oh,

2251
02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:36.640
I look doesn't matter quite as much as one might think,

2252
02:17:36.641 --> 02:17:40.840
but if you are less interested in seeing that go to youtube while you're at it,

2253
02:17:40.841 --> 02:17:44.380
subscribe.
That's a good way to support.
Plus we're going to,

2254
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:48.700
we do add other videos that are shorter in form.

2255
02:17:49.210 --> 02:17:51.640
We do have the video version and podcasts,
whole thing,
two hours,
three hours,

2256
02:17:51.641 --> 02:17:56.020
however long and echo is going to post a video of,

2257
02:17:56.290 --> 02:17:59.090
I think it's the most I've laughed,
uh,

2258
02:17:59.950 --> 02:18:03.410
captured on video and history.
So I was laughing at something that,

2259
02:18:03.430 --> 02:18:07.600
that was not in the podcast we were recording wasn't in the podcast.

2260
02:18:08.050 --> 02:18:12.830
I laughed.
It was really hard.
Is Pre podcasting pre podcast record sesh.
Sure.

2261
02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:15.940
And that happened.
So I'm looking forward to seeing that one.

2262
02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.140
You better get it up before this thing comes up
anyway.
Yeah.

2263
02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:24.580
Anyway,
that's a good way to support subscribe,
Youtube,

2264
02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.560
other ex ex small excerpts on there.

2265
02:18:26.561 --> 02:18:29.680
Anywhere from one minute to 12 minutes was the exception.

2266
02:18:29.681 --> 02:18:31.150
Usually it's between one and three minutes.

2267
02:18:31.151 --> 02:18:32.750
Little blessings that you can kind of straddle.

2268
02:18:32.751 --> 02:18:37.570
The one that thinks 12 minutes is an excerpt.
I Dunno.
I don't think that's right.

2269
02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:40.690
Technically it is.
Yeah,
I'd guess it is,
but technically less.

2270
02:18:40.691 --> 02:18:42.640
Make them three minutes.
Okay.
You got it.
You should.

2271
02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:45.690
You should put more effort into them and,
and,

2272
02:18:45.730 --> 02:18:50.530
and cut them down like the real critical parts.
That's what I think.
Okay.

2273
02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:55.930
Thank you for that out on the effort that at all.
No,
no,
no,
no.
All good.
Thank you.

2274
02:18:55.931 --> 02:18:58.660
Wreck your method.
No,
I'm going to try flank.
Hey,
you know what?

2275
02:18:59.290 --> 02:19:00.580
I think they're good,

2276
02:19:00.610 --> 02:19:03.810
but you think they'd be go over better if they were even a little bit shorter.

2277
02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:07.820
We think in the long ones.
Really pro with this stuff.
I'm just kind of over here.

2278
02:19:08.690 --> 02:19:13.660
See,
you got whatever you need.
You're the man.
But nonetheless,

2279
02:19:13.661 --> 02:19:17.420
that's a good way to support.
So you can make the excerpt 17 minutes long.
Yeah.

2280
02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:22.210
But maybe there's 17 minutes of complete beauty value.
Yeah,

2281
02:19:22.211 --> 02:19:27.130
exactly.
Right.
Also,

2282
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:28.280
Jocko has a store,

2283
02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:33.230
<v 2>it's called Jocko store,
Jacqueline [inaudible] dot com that's the website.</v>

2284
02:19:33.231 --> 02:19:36.800
So anyway on there,
there's what t shirts,
travel mugs,

2285
02:19:36.801 --> 02:19:38.690
some bumper stickers on there,
some patches.

2286
02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:45.020
These are velcro patches.
You can interchange them.
They're cool.

2287
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:48.050
They wound up being pretty cool.
Yeah,
I agree.
Yeah.

2288
02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:51.290
Guys that are deployed.
Yeah.

2289
02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:55.580
Representing those overseas.
Yeah.
It's so cool too.
Um,

2290
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:59.990
it's,
it's weird because
you know,

2291
02:19:59.991 --> 02:20:02.430
like you always say like we're sitting in this room,
you know,

2292
02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:07.100
and sure we've got some patches out there,
but to see him likable,
but you know,

2293
02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:10.400
they'll post it on social and they'll send it to you and they'll tag and stuff

2294
02:20:10.401 --> 02:20:13.010
like that.
And to see him like Dang,
guys are rolling around,

2295
02:20:13.011 --> 02:20:16.550
straight up representing.
It's like,
it's weird.
It's,
it's,
we're in a good way.

2296
02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:20.990
Yeah.
No,
it's awesome.
Yeah,
it's super awesome to see hope.
So yeah,

2297
02:20:21.050 --> 02:20:22.040
there's some stuff on there.
Hey,

2298
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:25.880
just got the docker store.com that's the website.
And Hey,

2299
02:20:26.390 --> 02:20:29.930
if you like what you see,
if you like an item,
get an item.

2300
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:33.560
Good way to support also on your journey.

2301
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:37.430
We all,
no matter what Jocko will ever say,

2302
02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:39.680
we all hit moments of weakness.

2303
02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:44.900
And just like if you're going to Max Bench,

2304
02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:48.500
I know I said this before,
I'm a say it again because it holds true.

2305
02:20:48.501 --> 02:20:53.210
If you're going to go one rep max or even to write Max whatever on bench.

2306
02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:55.250
What about three rep max,
three Rep Max as well.

2307
02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.250
It starts to get a little bit more safe I think in my opinion,

2308
02:20:58.251 --> 02:21:00.290
but let's say two rep backs,

2309
02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:05.500
you're going to have someone there to spot you just in case you fully intend to

2310
02:21:06.141 --> 02:21:10.250
get those two reps fully,
but when you're pushing it,

2311
02:21:10.490 --> 02:21:15.490
it's wise to have a spot because if for some reason maybe you didn't eat your,

2312
02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:20.120
you know a good whatever,
maybe didn't get enough sleep,
I don't know,

2313
02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.120
but you could hit a little roadblock.
Little moment of weakness.

2314
02:21:23.121 --> 02:21:24.860
You have that spot there,
boom gets do through,

2315
02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:28.190
get to that last inch on your rep or whatever keeps you on your path.

2316
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:33.130
This is the real world version of this is called psychological warfare and what

2317
02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:35.030
that is.
It's an album with tracks,

2318
02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:39.350
Jocko tracks and for any situation you might find yourself in that you have a

2319
02:21:39.351 --> 02:21:42.830
moment of weakness like getting up in the morning or skipping your workout when

2320
02:21:42.831 --> 02:21:45.470
you intended to work out or slacking on your diet.

2321
02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:51.170
Jocko will be there with a track that'll help you through it.

2322
02:21:51.470 --> 02:21:55.070
It's called psychological warfare.
Jocko Willink.
Do a search,
iTunes,

2323
02:21:56.540 --> 02:22:01.370
Amazon music,
other MP3,
providing,
what do you call it?
Outlets.

2324
02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:06.530
Outlets.
Yeah,
that's a good one.
Real good on.
Cool.

2325
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:09.950
Also,
you know we've got,

2326
02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:15.920
we've got kind of a kind of a big announcement coming,

2327
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:20.000
which we haven't really had any big announcements,
right?
I'm not a big,

2328
02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:23.710
you know what,
I'm not a big announcement kind of guy.
Right.
Plus,

2329
02:22:23.711 --> 02:22:26.070
so I guess I'm not going to do this whole thing.
The big amounts of things.
I

2330
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.420
<v 0>will,
I will say this.
This is it.
Okay.</v>

2331
02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:33.330
Just we'll say we're not going to hold back.
This is what's going on.

2332
02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:38.840
After many months of due diligence and conversations and relationship building

2333
02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:47.670
and growing understanding,

2334
02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:53.610
we are actually joining forces
with

2335
02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:59.790
a company called origin
origin,

2336
02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:03.180
Brazilian Jujitsu
in Maine.

2337
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:06.390
Now this actually occurred,

2338
02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:11.100
believe it or not do to this podcast,
this podcast,

2339
02:23:11.101 --> 02:23:15.720
I was doing a Facebook live.
I said something about,

2340
02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:19.910
this was months ago,
said something about origin day.

2341
02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:22.650
If you want to Geek giggy from origin,
they make them in America.

2342
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:28.050
They're well crafted,
special material woven up in Maine.
They're cool.

2343
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:32.310
Check 'em out.
And Sarah Armstrong,
you know Sarah,
I'm sorry.

2344
02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:35.490
Of course they do.
She motivated,

2345
02:23:36.210 --> 02:23:41.210
got after it and put me in touch with this guy p Roberts,

2346
02:23:41.701 --> 02:23:45.420
who's the founder and owner of origin.

2347
02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:49.350
And you know,
I knew about them.

2348
02:23:49.351 --> 02:23:51.840
That's why I was talking about them on the Facebook live cause I,

2349
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:55.420
cause I had seen him and I had known that like a,
uh,

2350
02:23:55.590 --> 02:24:00.180
like a possessed psychopath.
He wanted to make cheese in America.

2351
02:24:00.181 --> 02:24:05.181
So we went and found looms to weave material with that,

2352
02:24:05.671 --> 02:24:08.700
all that stuff.
And He,
and the thing is,

2353
02:24:08.701 --> 02:24:13.701
is he was basically alone with his team on his quest to make this happen.

2354
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:19.380
But the cool thing is he's not alone anymore.

2355
02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:26.190
He has a partner now.
In fact,
it is partners.

2356
02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:29.070
Now me,
you,
and,

2357
02:24:29.130 --> 02:24:32.580
and really all of us to help out,

2358
02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:36.580
to get in the game with what we're doing now and,

2359
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:38.430
and just say no origin.
Like I said,

2360
02:24:38.431 --> 02:24:42.330
it's not some brand that's throwing some graphics onto a tee shirt,
right?

2361
02:24:42.510 --> 02:24:44.130
That's not,
well,
that's not what's going on there.

2362
02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:49.800
You have a legitimate movement,
for lack of a better word,

2363
02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:55.020
of a guy that is up there.
And what we're trying to do is read,

2364
02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:00.280
read,
rebirth manufacturing in America.

2365
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:04.580
So that's it started with geese.
Um,

2366
02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:07.300
that's definitely a huge focus.
But we're going to make everything,

2367
02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:11.620
we're going to build the best gear in the world,
not just for Jujitsu,

2368
02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:14.860
but for everything you do in life.

2369
02:25:14.890 --> 02:25:19.890
We're going to make the best gear for being on the warpath.

2370
02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:24.280
That's what we're going to do.
So we'll come out with a bunch of details.

2371
02:25:24.281 --> 02:25:27.930
That's the big announcement that was going to come.
I just made it.
So,
Hey,

2372
02:25:27.931 --> 02:25:32.470
and you know what?
In the meantime,
a checkout origin,

2373
02:25:32.471 --> 02:25:36.820
main.com for geese,
for rash guards,
for whatever else you might need.

2374
02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:40.870
And if you want to see what this is all about,
by the way,

2375
02:25:42.610 --> 02:25:44.230
if you want to see what we're going to do,

2376
02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:48.190
come up to the camp that we're having with digit to camp up in Maine.

2377
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.580
Echo's going to be there.
I'm going to be there.

2378
02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:53.140
A bunch of black belts are going to be there.

2379
02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:58.380
We're going to be getting after it or cruising or both.

2380
02:25:59.590 --> 02:26:04.120
It's August 20th through the 27th two sessions are going to be their echo and I

2381
02:26:04.121 --> 02:26:08.320
are going to be there the last day of the first session in the first day of the

2382
02:26:08.321 --> 02:26:12.100
second session.
So that's when we're going to be up there.

2383
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:17.260
And people been asking what level of Jujitsu do you need to be?

2384
02:26:17.350 --> 02:26:20.230
You can be any level if you've never done it before.
That's cool.
Calm oil,

2385
02:26:20.231 --> 02:26:23.020
teach you,
we'll give you the base.
I will give you the basic,

2386
02:26:23.021 --> 02:26:25.930
that thing that echo talked about earlier.
Um,

2387
02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:29.680
but so of you've never done it.
Come learn.

2388
02:26:30.310 --> 02:26:32.380
It'll be the best introduction you're ever going to get in your life.

2389
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:33.783
Quite frankly.

2390
02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:39.280
Just to come and train immersion for either four days or seven days.

2391
02:26:39.730 --> 02:26:43.750
That's a,
it's a good way to start learning the language,
get immersed in it.
And,

2392
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.950
and by the way also if you're a black belt or a brown belt or a purple belt and

2393
02:26:47.951 --> 02:26:49.690
you want to come up and just train hard core with a bunch of good dudes,

2394
02:26:49.691 --> 02:26:51.520
come on up.
So that's that also,

2395
02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:54.880
this is cool on the 23rd of August,

2396
02:26:54.881 --> 02:26:59.260
so in the middle of that camp there is,
we are opening,

2397
02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:01.450
opening a new factory,

2398
02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:07.200
20,000 square feet of American manufacturing in Farmington,

2399
02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:11.650
Maine.
Uh,
come on up.
It's actually open to the public.

2400
02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:15.880
So come on up,
hang out.
We're going to be there,
you know,

2401
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:19.180
doing what we do,
cruising,
checking now.
And it's going to be,

2402
02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:23.980
it's like pretty historical in my mind.
This merging of bad,

2403
02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:29.760
bad ass Nis come into fruition after many months behind the scenes.

2404
02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:35.170
Um,
so yeah,
come and join us on that day.
The 23rd,
even if you're not the camp,

2405
02:27:35.171 --> 02:27:37.420
come on up.
Uh,

2406
02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:42.370
you know what else we're going to have at the camp Jocko white tea they get,

2407
02:27:43.530 --> 02:27:45.670

So,
uh,

if you,

2408
02:27:45.671 --> 02:27:47.380
if you're not coming to camp and you want to talk a white tea,

2409
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:49.000
you can go get it on Amazon.
If you're,

2410
02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:54.360
if you're sick and tired of dead lifting less than 8,000 pounds,

2411
02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:59.440
order some immediately.
Also weigh the warrior kid.

2412
02:27:59.710 --> 02:28:04.420
And thank you for all this awesome feedback that everyone's been giving me of

2413
02:28:04.421 --> 02:28:07.870
kids getting stronger and faster and smarter and better.

2414
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:13.930
That's awesome.
So if you have a kid or you know,

2415
02:28:13.931 --> 02:28:18.610

if you're wondering,

2416
02:28:18.611 --> 02:28:21.510
well to war your kid is that for girls,
believe me.
Well,

2417
02:28:21.511 --> 02:28:24.440
what is your girl think of it after does it doesn't matter.

2418
02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:29.450
So they need it.
We all need it.

2419
02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:33.410
So get one for yourself as as well.

2420
02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:38.720
There's lessons for everybody in there from Uncle Jake.
True.
Uh,

2421
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:42.260
the other one got another book coming out and discipline equals freedom field

2422
02:28:42.261 --> 02:28:45.950
manual.
Now.
If you want a feel good book,

2423
02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:49.190
if you want a book that's going to fill you with a bunch of fantasies,

2424
02:28:49.191 --> 02:28:53.780
don't get this book book is not for you.
This book is real.

2425
02:28:53.781 --> 02:28:57.320
This book is going to hit you hard and if you don't want to get hit hard,

2426
02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:01.250
then don't order it.
If you want to be coddled,
don't get this book.

2427
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:04.940
If you want to be lied to,
don't get this book,

2428
02:29:06.110 --> 02:29:10.940
but if you want the truth,
Andy,
if you want to get stronger,

2429
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:15.170
faster,
smarter and better,
then yes,
go ahead and order this book.

2430
02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:18.920
Order it from your local bookstore.

2431
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:23.810
Go into them and say,
ah,
you know,
can I order this book?

2432
02:29:24.410 --> 02:29:25.610
And when you get it in,

2433
02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:29.450
can you just put it in the get after its section for me so I can find it?

2434
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.860
So discipline equals freedom field manual.
Order it online,

2435
02:29:36.861 --> 02:29:41.660
Barnes and nobles,
Amazon,
your local bookstore.

2436
02:29:42.470 --> 02:29:46.700
Put the word out.
Of course,
you can also get extreme ownership.

2437
02:29:47.210 --> 02:29:50.240
Ownership is a key word there.
And I recommend you own it.

2438
02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:54.710
Get that book,
own it yourself and get it your team.

2439
02:29:55.340 --> 02:30:00.340
The copies as well so that you can go out and annihilate your enemy or your

2440
02:30:00.411 --> 02:30:04.970
competitor who,
whoever's offering you.
We also have echelon,

2441
02:30:04.971 --> 02:30:07.880
front leadership consulting.
No one else can do what we do.

2442
02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:13.490
And I'm saying that right now and the reason I'm saying that now it's cause

2443
02:30:13.491 --> 02:30:17.150
we've been doing it long enough and I've seen what other people do from a

2444
02:30:17.151 --> 02:30:20.630
leadership perspective and consulting.
No one else can do what we do.

2445
02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:25.690
So if you need leadership alignment so your team can win,

2446
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:31.190

September 14th and 15th in San Diego.

2452
02:30:52.700 --> 02:30:56.690
This is kind of crazy.
We've already sold more than half the tickets,

2453
02:30:57.200 --> 02:30:58.970
so this is absolutely going to sell out.

2454
02:30:58.971 --> 02:31:00.830
Just like it sold out the first time in San Diego,

2455
02:31:00.831 --> 02:31:04.640
just like it sold out in New York City.
Just like it sold out in Austin,
Texas.

2456
02:31:04.641 --> 02:31:06.020
Don't get left out in the cold.

2459
02:31:17.781 --> 02:31:18.614
monster,

2460
02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:24.400
we're not hard to find because we're rolling on the interwebs kind of hard,

2461
02:31:25.470 --> 02:31:29.870
actually extra hard,
something we're on Twitter.
Sure.

2462
02:31:31.410 --> 02:31:34.920
The Instagram and dad,
VC boy

2463
02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:41.760
echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2464
02:31:41.761 --> 02:31:46.590
And finally,
thanks to everyone that makes this podcast possible.

2465
02:31:46.591 --> 02:31:48.060

whether you're going through good times or bad times,

2475

whether you're winning the game or you're making a comeback,

2476
02:32:32.690 --> 02:32:36.830
whether you're building a house or a road,

2477
02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:39.980
or a bridge,
or a piece of software,

2478
02:32:40.100 --> 02:32:43.820
whether you're assembling a car or assembling a meeting,

2479
02:32:46.470 --> 02:32:48.720
or if you're in a diner,

2480
02:32:50.300 --> 02:32:54.740
pouring a cup of coffee for someone that's about to go out and pour concrete,

2481
02:32:57.210 --> 02:33:00.630
whether you're sowing seeds in a field

2482
02:33:02.650 --> 02:33:07.330
or sewing the stitches into a geek,
no matter what you're doing

2483
02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:13.380
and what you come up against,
fight hard.

2484
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:15.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2485
02:33:15.690 --> 02:33:19.620
