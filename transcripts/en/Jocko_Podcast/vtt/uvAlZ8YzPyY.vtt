00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.470
This is Jocko podcast number one 52 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.410
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.643
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.540
<v 0>These are men that would rather die than live with the shame that they didn't</v>

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
offer their last breath in service to the men,

6
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:24.540
to their left and to the right in battle.

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.580
Each man was shaped through immense trials,

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.290
personal fortitude and dedication,
giving all he had to offer

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.930
at times when only the great pride of walking in the path least traveled was

10
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:43.400
there to keep him company

11
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.850
through constant discipline,
drive and sacrifice.

12
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.030
They have risen to the top of their trade and embodied the ethos of the Marine

13
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.933
Raider.

14
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.570
A man who displays the very pinnacle of Soldiery Virtue and Unwavering Loyalty.

15
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.060
A man who will never quit or surrender and who,
uh,

16
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.100
who will at all times stand ready to sacrifice whatever is needed to accomplish

17
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:14.684
the mission.

18
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.680
They stand as shiny examples of what our nation in trusts.

19
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.660
It's freedom and respect too.

20
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.450
Nothing is more on inspiring.

21
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.850
Then the look on a fellow operators face as they are surrounded by death,

22
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.220
the casual smile of confidence as they acknowledge that things will be what

23
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:47.460
they'll be.
And if this is the way we die,

24
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.800
then let's do it right and honor our legacy.

25
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.400
<v 0>When surrounded on all sides,</v>

27
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.530
we faced what seemed the inevitability of death,

28
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.600
not a man before you skipped a beat and their commitment.

29
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.250
<v 0>All or nothing.
Death or glory.</v>

31
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.050
And those are some excerpts from a speech by Marine Raider Gunnery Sergeant

32
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.520
Brian.

33
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.520
See Jacqueline talking about a mission that he was on heroin.

34
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.870
I think in that speech he did a great job of explaining the type of man that

35
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:47.800
makes up the marine Raiders,

36
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.360
which is the marine core component of special operations.

37
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.180
And tonight we are lucky enough to be sitting with one of those men,

38
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.430
a United States

39
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.263
<v 2>marine,</v>

40
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.540
a special operations radar and a true Herro Derek Herrera.

41
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.660
<v 1>Okay,</v>

42
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.460
<v 2>Derek,
welcome man.
Thanks for coming on.
Thanks for having me.</v>

43
00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.440
It's a pleasure to be here.
It's awesome to have you on here,
man.

44
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:20.820
I know we got hooked up through some,
uh,
old mutual friends and I'm glad we did.

45
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:25.320
And I'm glad to sit down and be able to talk to you and hear a little bit about

46
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.750
you and your life and everything that you've done.

47
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.400
And as usual,
let's start in a,

48
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.470
let's start in Little Rock,
Arkansas.
Sounds good.
Yeah.

49
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.760
We're just where you were born,
right?
I was born in Little Rock,

50
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:42.600
Arkansas and Wah Wah Wah.
Like what was the family doing in Little Rock,
Arkansas?

51
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.300
My father was a pilot in the air force.
Okay.

52
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.290
And so we were stationed there and I was born there in 1984.
And,

53
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.250
and then how long were you guys moving around all the time?

54
00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:55.920
Typical military family?
Yes,
absolutely.

55
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.980
So moved about every two or three years.

56
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.120
So I lived in Arkansas for about two years,
moved to Illinois,

57
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.830
I think for a year or two.
And then,
uh,
Honduras,
uh,

58
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.980
for an overseas assignment to go see all the Honduras in the late eighties,

59
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.810
which was pretty interesting.
Do you speak Spanish then?
No,
I,

60
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.420
I did for a while and then tried to replace it with Arabic and then Pashto and

61
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.250
yeah,
I learned that it's not one of my gifts.

62
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.900
Let's just go with English and get a terp.
Exactly.
Uh,

63
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.170
so knew enough to be tactically conversing,
you know,
but um,
but now,

64
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.730
so live there for a few years.
And then,
uh,
my dad moved to Dover,

65
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:37.320
Delaware was stationed at Dover Air Force Base.

66
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.000
He was a c one 30 and c five pilot and uh,
continue to bounce around.

67
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.610
But at that time in elementary school,
my parents are divorced,

68
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:47.640
so my family still lives in Delaware today.

69
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.530
Also the opportunity to live in Colorado and a few other places.
But at what,

70
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.700
at what age were you when you got sorta like the military bug in your head?

71
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.680
It was always a family business.

72
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.740
So my grandfathers were both in the Air Force for 25 years and 28 years

73
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.000
respectively.
They were enlisted in the air force.
Um,

74
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.160
and my father was an air force for 22 years in active duty.

75
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.850
How did you get knocked?
Get Bit by the Air Force Bug was interesting.

76
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:19.170
So go through high school.
Uh,
I'd always knew I wanted to serve in the military,

77
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.270
um,
and started to get interested in the surface academy a option as well.

78
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.220
So when I lived in Colorado,
actually made,
I was,

79
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.480
I loved my dad when he was stationed at the Air Force Academy.

80
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:31.350
So we get on the Air Force Academy when I was there for seventh and eighth grade

81
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.080
and uh,

82
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.120
just always was drawn to that line of work and a desire to air force academy is,

83
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.080
that's a nice environment.
I really nice.
It's a really nice environment.

84
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.980
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,

85
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.030
and your dad was working there and that it seemed,
it was that not,
I mean,

86
00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:53.910
when you say you were thinking about the,
the military academies,

87
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:58.160
were you thinking of the Air Force Academy as your primary or no.
Uh,

88
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.670
<v 3>so after that experience,
um,
in ninth grade,</v>

89
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:05.900
I moved back with my mom in high school in Delaware and,
uh,

90
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.170
my senior year of high school,
um,

91
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.820
had been playing lacrosse up to that point and had the opportunity to go and

92
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.220
play for navy,
uh,
or try to walk on at least,

93
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.780
and had decent relationship with the coaches there.
Um,

94
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.010
and so I was applying to navy and air force and,
uh,

95
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.830
also want it to be a navy seal actually.
And so,
um,

96
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.620
at that time I wanted to go to the naval academy.

97
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.360
And so as soon as I got in and got accepted there,
uh,

98
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.220
stopped applying other places and just decided to go there.
Yeah,
right on.
Yeah.

99
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.220
<v 0>When did you visit the Naval Academy?</v>

100
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.590
Do you know what was going on at the Naval Academy?

101
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.760
The only reason I asked that is because like,
I mean,

102
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:46.250
I know I was not the most squared away kid.

103
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:49.880
I was kind of a rebellious kid and even though I love the military,

104
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:51.920
I think if I would have gone to,

105
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.860
and I went to west point when I was a little kid and that Kinda got me fired up,

106
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.070
you know,
I think my dad took me to some kind of game there.
I mean,

107
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:00.860
I was really young,
like maybe seven or eight or something like that,

108
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.410
but it was enough to make me go.
Yeah.
You know,
I kind of,

109
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.310
but I think if I saw it when I was a little bit older,
I dunno,

110
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.990
I think I would have just said like,

111
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:12.100
I don't know if I can put up with all that right now.
Yeah,

112
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.380
but you did.
You were like,
I'm,
I'm bringing it,
you know,

113
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.490
<v 3>17 year old young man,
uh,</v>

114
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.450
doesn't always have all the right motivations.
Uh,
and you know,

115
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.300
you have all the reasons why you go to a place like that.

116
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.110
And what I found after I had gone there was that,
uh,

117
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.610
those reasons change once you're there.
And so I entered in 2002,
uh,

118
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.510
shortly after September 11th.
Uh,

119
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.290
it wasn't solely out of patriotic duty and every,
you know,

120
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:44.120
and those sorts of things.
It was because,
you know,
I had already gotten in,
uh,

121
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.230
I'd wanted to play lacrosse there.
Uh,

122
00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:48.930
I was in love with my high school sweetheart from Delaware,

123
00:07:48.931 --> 00:07:53.100
who's now still my wife of almost 13 years.
Um,

124
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.190
and so those were the reasons why it initially,
you know,
decided,
yeah,

125
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.570
<v 0>how did that play?
How did you have in your high school sweetheart,</v>

126
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:01.280
how did that play in to want to go into the Naval Academy?

127
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:02.600
Because you would be close by.

128
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.330
<v 3>It was about an hour drive away so she could come and see me on the weekend and</v>

129
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.100
that kind of stuff.
And,
uh,

130
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.320
and so those were some of the initial reasons why I went there.
In addition,

131
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.700
all the,
the patriotic reasons as well.
But,
uh,
what I found when I was there,

132
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:19.780
and you're challenged and you're tested,
is those smaller,

133
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:21.910
superficial motivators often fade away,
right?

134
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:26.260
And what you're left with is those reasons why I initially went here aren't

135
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:29.710
going to continue to propel me through the rest of this trial.
Right?

136
00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:33.760
And so the motivation and the things that I learned from there at that point
was,

137
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.360
uh,
the seniors that,
uh,

138
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.740
we'd watched and,
and were led by,
uh,
who had just graduated.

139
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:46.360
We're literally going forward and leading marines and sailors in battle.

140
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.840
And we literally watch that on television with the invasion of Iraq and,
and the,

141
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.940
the things going on in Afghanistan and uh,

142
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.250
really bought into the entire leadership philosophy and,
and

143
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.160
<v 0>wanting to be a part of that and want it to be that and follow that example.</v>

144
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.940
So those are the reasons why I tried to stay and continue to move forward and

145
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:06.090
become a military officer.
I always,

146
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.610
lately I've been like apologizing to people because there's actually been a

147
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.140
pretty decent number of people that have joined the military because of

148
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:17.130
listening to,
you know,

149
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.610
all of us guys that bring on here talk about their experiences and they just

150
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.060
think that sounds pretty cool.
I always say,
hey,

151
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:27.530
just don't be mad at me like the first two weeks that you're going through boot

152
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:30.320
camp or whatever.
Don't be mad.
Cause it's just,
it's like not,

153
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.930
it's going to be a shock to your system when you lose all that freedom that

154
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:36.090
you've had.
And,
but I,

155
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:39.540
I totally agree with you in the fact that like once you get through that initial

156
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:43.080
shock and you realize that there's a longterm thing going on here and you want

157
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:46.200
to be a part of it,
that's,
yeah,
that's,
that's,
that's awesome.

158
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.370
And especially for you guys that came in after September 11th,
because that's a,

159
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:52.980
that's a,
I don't know if people can appreciate that,

160
00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:57.981
what the difference is between the pre September 11th and post September 11th.

161
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:02.610
I mean pre September 11th,
there was almost,
in fact,

162
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:07.380
my first deployment to Iraq,
my seal platoon had zero combat experience,

163
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.370
zero zero.
So no one had any combat experience at all.

164
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.560
The most things that anyone had done at that point was doing shit boardings in

165
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:20.840
the Persian Gulf,
which are not combat experience.
It's just,
uh,
it's just,
uh,
uh,

166
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.740
fairly administrative operation.
And now every single guy,

167
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.660
every single guy in the seal teams has combat expenses.
Every single guy.

168
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.370
Well,
I mean barring maybe a few outliers,
but basically every single guy,

169
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.060
you know,
the Marine Corps,
look at the Marine Corps right now.
I mean it's been,

170
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.410
it's been what,

171
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.440
17 years of fighting and the combat experience is just so incredible compared to

172
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.280
prior to September 11th which it was totally rare to have somebody at a seal

173
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:56.520
team that was in the first Gulf War that was in one of the three platoons that

174
00:10:56.521 --> 00:11:00.180
got to do something.
And,
and what they did,
you know,
God bless them,

175
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.080
they were doing their duty,

176
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:05.550
but it wasn't these big long sustained combat operations.
Yeah,

177
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.680
it's interesting.
And I think that's something that you know,

178
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.730
I think about a lot today,

179
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:11.850
especially when we talk about millennials and everything else and they get a bad

180
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:15.160
rep,
but everybody knows what they're joining the military to do.
Like,

181
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.900
and some men and women run to the sound of the gun and some don't.

182
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.810
And so the people that continue to stay,
and like there was no question of what,

183
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.350
what you were doing if you sign up to join the Marine Corps or the seals.
Right.

184
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.420
Like,
and then how did that selection process,

185
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.460
you said you wanted to possibly go in the seal teams.

186
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.360
How did that work out that you didn't go in the seal teams and that's gotta be a

187
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:38.100
tough decision to make.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
sometimes it's made for you,
right?
So,

188
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.540
uh,
naval academy is a very,
very humbling experience.
Um,

189
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:43.800
and so as I came out of high school,

190
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.210
I was kind of a very talented young athlete and you know,

191
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:53.230
uh,
was able to get in.
Um,
but I was also from a small town and,
you know,

192
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.070
it didn't have

193
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.500
<v 3>the humility and,
and ownership,
uh,</v>

194
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.870
needed to be a part of the teams.
And,
uh,
that became readily apparent.
Y'All,

195
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.350
I was physically capable,
but just wasn't mature enough,
honestly.
Uh,
and wasn't,

196
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.500
you know,
didn't have that right mindset.
So it was thoroughly humbled.

197
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:10.600
And then as I was kind of,
you know,

198
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.470
coming to the realization of what I wanted to do with my life,
what,
what now,
uh,

199
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.440
you know,
had a mentor of mine who I really respected,
uh,

200
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.350
who was a marine major and said,
you know,

201
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:24.610
Derek Lik I can help you try to get in the Marine Corps if you're still wanting

202
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:27.070
to do that.
And that's what you want to,
I think you'd make a great officer.
And,

203
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.361
um,
you know,

204
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:33.010
the Marine Corps that you see at the naval academy is not what is the reality,

205
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.180
right,
of what the fleet does.

206
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:38.250
Because I had a really bad taste for marines there because all the marines ever

207
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.640
drill instructors and it was their job to mess with you.
And,
uh,
so I was like,

208
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:45.600
man,
reigns are dumb.
I don't want to be like that.
Um,

209
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.080
but the more I got to know the reality of what it was like in the fleet and
what,

210
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.860
what real marines were doing,
uh,

211
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:53.620
decided to pursue it and absolutely loved it and it was the best thing for me.

212
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.030
And did you get,
so then you go from there too,
from the academy,

213
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.590
go to the basic school,
correct.
Yeah.
So we go to the basic school,

214
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.210
we go for the six months of,
of the basic school and,
uh,

215
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.970
with evergreen officer.
So every marine officer,
ground air,

216
00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:10.960
everybody goes through that same process.
And then during that time,

217
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:13.180
there's another selection.
Uh,
so,
you know,

218
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:17.980
literally rank every choice you have from the tanks,
supply,

219
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:21.280
logistics,
finance,
I like one through 21,

220
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.470
if you're a ground officer or if your pilot,

221
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:26.020
obviously you have a flight contract,
you don't have to do that,

222
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:30.290
but you rank it and then they do a quality spread to determine what you get.

223
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.090
So in some cases,
uh,
pre nine 11,
like you said,
it was,

224
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:37.270
it was really hard and competitive to become an infantry officer.
Uh,

225
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.160
and then when we were there,
um,

226
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.630
it was still pretty competitive until about halfway through the course,

227
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.520
or just give me like a month out from the end of the course because manpower

228
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:52.660
came down and was like,
we're standing up a new infantry regiment.
So boom.
Yeah.

229
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:57.210
And so,
uh,
so I think I would've gotten infantry regardless,
but,
uh,
either way.

230
00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:57.831
Got what I wanted.

231
00:13:57.831 --> 00:14:00.790
It was my first choice and that's exactly what I wanted to do and move forward.

232
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.520
And then where'd you,
where'd you go from from there?
Where'd you,

233
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.390
she's saying Quantico for a three month course called infantry officer's course

234
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.070
gets on and it's amazing.
Yeah.

235
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.410
One of the best training experiences there are.

236
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:18.580
And so you learn weapon systems,
you learn,
you know,
every,
all,

237
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.500
all different kinds of basic small unit tactics,

238
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:25.501
everything you need to be able to lead a rifle platoon in an infantry battalion.

239
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.490
Yeah.
I don't know if you,
yeah,

240
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:32.491
you said you listened to the podcast with Jim Webb on it and like his first of

241
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:36.910
all.
And so then you went to a battalion and then you started to work up.
Yeah.

242
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.750
And all that.

243
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.640
Jim Webb went from that school to Vietnam and they like brought him out in the

244
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:45.310
field and dropped him off and said,
there's your platoon over there.

245
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.600
The guy you're replacing is no longer with us and you're going to go take over

246
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:52.130
that battalion.
And he walked up on the side a hill and said,

247
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.990
<v 2>hey,
how you doing?
I'm Lieutenant Webb and here's what we're going to do.
And,</v>

248
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.860
and then that night they got a big firefight and he called in combined arms and

249
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.360
man,
but that school must be,
must be an awesome school,
but it's pretty amazing.

250
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.160
And by the time we were there,

251
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:11.600
we had really phenomenal leaders and instructors who are able to teach us

252
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:15.200
because they were fresh off the battlefield in Iraq and a rebel to teach us

253
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:16.610
exactly what we were going to do.
And so for me,

254
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.070
I went into a long workup prior to deploying,

255
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:21.980
but some of our guys were just like,
what happened to Jim Webb?
No kidding.

256
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.960
They had maybe a month or meeting their platoon at their final exercise as

257
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:30.920
they're stepping off to,
to go to Iraq.
And so that's no joke,
right?
There was,

258
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.960
yeah,
it was pretty interesting.
And so,

259
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.890
<v 3>um,
for me,
you know,</v>

260
00:15:34.891 --> 00:15:38.100
I ended up going to a new battalion that was standing up First Battalion Eighth

261
00:15:38.101 --> 00:15:42.030
Marines,
uh,
the walking dead and,
uh,

262
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.440
had about a year roughly to work in local tune in and to train before we ended

263
00:15:46.441 --> 00:15:48.290
up deploying to Iraq.
Yeah.

264
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:53.220
<v 2>And that was just a standard ground pounder,
infantry platoon initially.</v>

265
00:15:53.221 --> 00:15:54.090
Yes.
Yeah.

266
00:15:54.091 --> 00:15:59.091
And so we were a standard rifle tune and then about two months before deployment

267
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.770
based on the needs of the situation in

268
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.640
<v 3>Ramadi,
we're redeploying to,
uh,</v>

269
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.890
the decision was made to actually break us down into smaller training teams and

270
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:13.700
advisory teams.

271
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.700
And so my platoon of roughly 40 marines and sailors turned into two 12 man

272
00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:20.630
teams,
uh,

273
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.150
which I was in charge of wine and my platoon sergeant was in charge of another

274
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:23.540
one.

275
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.250
And so the reason they did that was because that was roughly the minimum size

276
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:32.750
required to partner with,
uh,
effectively for these police stations.

277
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.860
And so at that time,
due to the,
uh,

278
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:41.570
the successes of people like yourself and the other people that had fought in

279
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:46.220
Ramadi and turn the tide of the battle,
uh,
we were consolidating and basically,

280
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.930
you know,
withdrawing a lot of the combat power.

281
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:52.010
And so we took over for two different infantry battalions that,

282
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.370
another army unit with just one infantry retired.
So we had the entire

283
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.230
area of operations for just one time.

284
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.290
And so I had a initially one police station that I was partnered with,
you know,

285
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.270
as a young lieutenant in a 12 man team.
We were partnered with,
uh,

286
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.070
an Iraqi colonel and over 800 Iraqi police.
Um,

287
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.020
<v 2>whereabouts were you wearing his,
we were in a small neighborhood,</v>

288
00:17:16.021 --> 00:17:19.590
just south of Camper Monte called Tamim.
Okay.
So all of to meme,

289
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.490
we were managing with the police there because the police had done such a good

290
00:17:23.491 --> 00:17:24.660
job and taken over,

291
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.073
<v 3>uh,</v>

292
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.100
<v 2>yeah,
we were in the backseat.
Yeah,
totally.
Just to give everyone a tooth,</v>

293
00:17:30.101 --> 00:17:32.380
this is 2008,
right?
Correct.

294
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:37.270
So the major fighting kind of tapered off in,
in

295
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.430
Oh seven.
I mean,
early oh seven,
they were pretty,
it was pretty calm.

296
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.840
I know the guys that relieved us by the time they laughed,
it was very common.

297
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:50.250
Ramadi,
um,
you know,
obviously there's still always going to be a,
but like to me

298
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.850
<v 0>when we were there,
there was,
there was a lot,
there was a really bad,
big,</v>

299
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:57.900
gnarly iads into me when we were there.
And it was,
it was,
uh,

300
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.040
yeah,
it was awful.
Some of the,

301
00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:02.780
some of those Humvees would get hit and it would just be,
you know,

302
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.680
they'd lose three,
four,
five guys at a,
at a shot.
It was a,
it was horrible,
but,

303
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.490
you know,
that's awesome.
And that's,
I always tried to explain to people that,

304
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.160
that in Ramadi we actually won.
And you,
you know,

305
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.920
you're proof of that when you were over there and you guys were,

306
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.570
I'm sure doing the civil affairs and,
you know,
that type of thing.

307
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.620
Is that basically what you were doing?

308
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.970
<v 2>Yeah,
we were,
you know,
just really just trying to turn it over,
uh,</v>

309
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.070
to the police there.
And so got to sit on,
you know,

310
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.280
the weekly Sheroes and the council meetings and hang out and drink tea with the

311
00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:39.640
current hall.
Um,
and we try to try to do operations with them and everything,

312
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.060
but they lock the place down.
I mean,

313
00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.670
literally by the time we were there they had,
you know,
triple strand,

314
00:18:45.671 --> 00:18:48.130
concertina wire and check points all around the entire cities.

315
00:18:48.131 --> 00:18:51.670
They were controlling the flow of that prevented the flow of any,
you know,

316
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.290
any material or any fighters.
So that then it did such a good job that honestly,

317
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.680
um,
I don't think anybody shot at us the entire deployment.

318
00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.960
We've got a few different smaller ideas here and there.

319
00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:06.400
We had one major incident with a vehicle borne IED that killed a lot of our

320
00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:08.770
Iraqi policemen,
unfortunately.
Um,

321
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.830
but none of our Americans were involved or had gotten,

322
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.820
gotten injured at that time.
Um,

323
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.820
but they were very well trained,
uh,
fighting force and you know,

324
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.440
they did good work.

325
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:25.610
<v 0>How was it setting the expectations for your 19 year old marines that was,</v>

326
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.420
that were,
you know,

327
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:30.960
on deployment with you that we're expecting to go get some yeah,

328
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.280
that was interesting.
So you gotta you gotta

329
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.980
<v 2>deal with the missions that you're,
you're given,
right.
And so,
um,</v>

330
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.190
the average 19 year old lance corporal or 18 year old lance corporal at that

331
00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:48.050
time,
uh,
you know,
sign up to join to go fight.
Yeah.
That wasn't our mission.

332
00:19:48.051 --> 00:19:51.440
And so we were very cognizant of that.
And over the year,
the workup,

333
00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.210
we were well educated too.

334
00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:57.260
So we had direct comes with the teams we were turning over with over a

335
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.510
classified email network and those sorts of things.

336
00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:01.560
And we're able to find out exactly what we'd be going into.

337
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.330
<v 0>You were able to manage those expectations appropriately.
Yeah.</v>

338
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.980
And because of that we were,
we were successful.

339
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.510
I think our teams performed well.
You know,
they're obviously frustrated at times,

340
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:17.320
you know?
Yeah,
no,
I can kind of,
I would have guys ask me that,
you know,
guys,

341
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.090
once I was,
while I was back when I was still in,
but guys would say,
you know,

342
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:23.660
how am I supposed to get guys fired up to do this mission when it's all we're

343
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.600
going to be doing is drinking tea.
And you know,
I'd say,
listen,
that's,

344
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.840
that's still your mission and you have to do it to the best of your ability and

345
00:20:30.841 --> 00:20:33.720
get the Iraqi police train up as much as best you can.

346
00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:38.310
And you still have to just attack it with everything you've got regardless of

347
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:41.760
what that mission is.
And,
and that's,
hey man,
that's,
that's what,

348
00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:44.700
that's what the nation is calling on you to do is that right there.

349
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:47.980
And so go do to the best of your ability.
And that's again,
you know,

350
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:49.990
that's why I asked you that question because believe me,

351
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.830
you get these young kids,
man,
they don't want to have tea with anybody.

352
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.870
I just want to shoot their right.
Yeah,
no,
we're pretty fortunate.

353
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.820
And we did do some interesting things

354
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.650
<v 3>as well.
So,
uh,</v>

355
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.880
because we had access and placement within the neighborhood,
um,

356
00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:14.210
to me was kind of a pretty tightly packed urban area and a lot of people would

357
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.570
come and go.
Uh,
and so at that time we had great intelligence networks.

358
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.220
They would able,
we're able to help,
you know,

359
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.980
help us identify if somebody didn't belong.

360
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:26.770
And we were able to work with our counterparts to,

361
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.630
to try to intervene before they were able to,
uh,
cause any issues.

362
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:36.010
And so we rounded up for a few different,
uh,
raids,
which,
you know,

363
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.710
kept,
uh,
kept the guns motivated and things.
But,
um,

364
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.120
but it's kind of a good and bad thing,
right?
That,
you know,
there was no,

365
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.320
no fight going on in that regards.
A good in the sense that,
you know,

366
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.490
the guys are safe and came back and were able to have a successful deployment.

367
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:55.170
It's still do something really meaningful for the country,
but you know,

368
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:56.541
not as,

369
00:21:56.541 --> 00:22:00.040
as exciting as they would have wanted because that's what the 18 year old signs

370
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.530
up to join,
to go do,
you know,
volunteers to do.

371
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.433
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

372
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.530
I don't think too many guys walking in that recruiter's office thinking about,

373
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.960
you know,
police actions or anything like that.
But yeah,
but that's,

374
00:22:11.961 --> 00:22:13.970
but you have to set their expectations correctly.

375
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.190
And then it sounds like you were able to do that.

376
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:21.380
Now when you came home from that deployment,
you,
you deployed again,

377
00:22:21.381 --> 00:22:25.340
but it was like even more,
it was even more on a humanitarian side.

378
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.410
So what was that like?
Well,
tell us about that one

379
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.560
<v 3>other stuff too.
So before I had actually a deployed,</v>

380
00:22:30.561 --> 00:22:34.580
again when I came back at such a good experience and learned about Marsoc at

381
00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:38.080
that time,
the Marine Special Operations Command that did selection,
uh,

382
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.100
in between those two,
uh,
deployments was selected.
And so,
uh,

383
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.280
at that time,
the criteria to get into mar soc was you had to do two deployments.

384
00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.400
And so I had to go back and train and then deploy again.

385
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.200
<v 0>So wait,
so the s selection like buds for Marsoc,</v>

386
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.460
is that what it is?
Kind of.
It's more

387
00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:01.520
<v 3>w we follow more of a Greenbrae army model.
So it's modeled very,</v>

388
00:23:01.521 --> 00:23:06.050
very similarly to,
uh,
the special forces assessment selection process.

389
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.820
How long is the,
the training?
It's about six weeks.
Um,
and so,

390
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.220
uh,
you go there and you do,
you know,

391
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.030
the basic tasks associated with selection,
including,
you know,

392
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.750
hiking a lot and land nav and psychological screenings is more of like a weeding

393
00:23:23.031 --> 00:23:26.600
out.
Are they actually training you for anything?
Uh,
yeah,
there's no,

394
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.030
I wouldn't say there's really much of training.

395
00:23:29.031 --> 00:23:32.510
It's a lot of critical thinking and problem solving and,
and very similar to the,

396
00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:35.090
as fast as far as like,
you know,
here's problem set,

397
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.020
ethical problem set and physical problems said teamwork and you're continually

398
00:23:39.021 --> 00:23:40.640
being evaluated.
Um,

399
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:45.670
but that's just a basic evaluation to just get the at going to

400
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.000
<v 2>like go into our training course.
And so then we have a seven month law.
Okay,</v>

401
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:50.451
I got it.

402
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:54.650
So first can we go through is just a selection to see if you're going to be able

403
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:59.360
to go through the real course?
Yeah.
Okay.
Got It.

404
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.740
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bud's doesn't do that.
You just show up there.
And that's what,

405
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.620
that's one of the reasons the attrition rate's so high.
Maybe if we had them pre,

406
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.950
and actually I take that back now they do have like a pre,

407
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.780
you go to like a pre buds and you get prepared for it and all that.

408
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.080
But um,
so you go to that selection and you get picked up.

409
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.860
So you go through that thing and they pick you up but then you haven't done two

410
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:24.410
deployments.
They go,
no,
you still got to go on an appointment again.
Yeah.

411
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.220
And that deployment ends up being a humanitarian deployment for the most part.

412
00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:29.630
Yeah.
Yeah,
definitely.

413
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:34.631
So we did what was called the Marine Expeditionary Unit and so on the Marine

414
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.210
Expeditionary Unit there are marines and Bark and bark,

415
00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:43.700
the board naval vessels and so there's a battalion infantry battalion.

416
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.700
I come too.
I did too,
a mew,
our deployments back in the day.

417
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.060
So I was out there with all,
all the boys getting after it.

418
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.820
That's how I've developed a bunch of,
you know,

419
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.060
have a bunch of friends that were in the Marine Corps in recon and force recon

420
00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:03.510
from that time from doing arg deployments.
So yeah,
we,

421
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.200
we got our shipboard time,

422
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.140
but we used to conceal his uncle don't really do that too much anymore,
but no,

423
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.910
no.
And Yeah,
and I think that's a good thing.
Um,
it was tough.
That was,

424
00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:14.750
that was pretty tough,
you know,

425
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.350
it was to talk about motivating your team to stay motivated through seven months

426
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:22.940
of shaking hands and drinking tea and Iraq and now it's,
hey,

427
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.500
stay ready and just train on a ship where,
you know,
you have no room,

428
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:28.930
you don't have any real ability to train.

429
00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.200
The Gym holds six people and there's three treadmills and you can't get on the

430
00:25:33.201 --> 00:25:37.130
flight deck for,
you know,
whatever,
two hours a day and kind of ship were you on?

431
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.960
So I was on,
uh,
the LPD 19.
I was in Mesa Verde.

432
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:43.880
It was nicer.
It was newer ship.

433
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.540
So it was nice and it was good because we were on the,
it was a smaller ship,

434
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:52.430
so we weren't on the major,
the big flat top with the command.
And so,

435
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.160
um,
so it was pretty good.
And,

436
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.860
and I had a great deployment because I was the company executive officer and so

437
00:25:57.861 --> 00:25:59.960
I got to spend very little time on the ship,

438
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.820
which was a lot of fun because you got to go and a plan,
all the training.
And so,

439
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.690
uh,
you know,

440
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.190
we were bouncing around doing different bilateral training missions with,
uh,

441
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.150
Israel,
Jordan Amman,
uh,
trained in Kuwait,

442
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.990
had some liberty time and cut her by renting.
Uh,

443
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.710
all of the peaceful countries in Middle East said.
So it was,
it was good.

444
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.650
It was a really good experience.
Um,
but you know,

445
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.050
a lot of marines hate it because they were stuck on the ship.

446
00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:30.680
They didn't have the luxury that I did to go and get off the ship and,
and train.

447
00:26:30.681 --> 00:26:33.820
And so it was,
uh,
it was interesting deployment.
Yeah.

448
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.760
Those shipboard deployments are,
um,
very interesting.
They were like,

449
00:26:37.761 --> 00:26:39.620
we would do that really dumb stuff.
First of all,

450
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.010
when I was on shipboard deployments,
there was no internet,
there was nothing.
So

451
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.510
<v 0>we,
we was mailing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I mean we were just dumb and so we would watch,</v>

452
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.710
we had,
you know,
a big box full of video tapes.
Do you know what those are?
Yeah.

453
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.850
Yes.
Video cassettes.
Because there was no whatever,

454
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.480
streaming Netflix.
So we just add like auditor,

455
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.160
we probably watched 20 movies 5,000 times each.

456
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.720
So that era of movies I'm very familiar with.
But,

457
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.640
but yeah,
and it was like,
you know,

458
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:14.700
the big joke about seals is when you're on a ship is sleep,
eat and lift.

459
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.790
That's what it stands for,
to sleep,
eat and left.
Cause that's all there is to do.

460
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.560
And,
but we would,

461
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:23.970
we would PT every day out on the flight deck or somewhere on the ship.

462
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:27.510
And then we would try and set up where we'd go shoot skeet,

463
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.440
we brawn and pallets and pallets worth of skeet.
So we'd go on the back,

464
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.110
the fantail the ship and throw skeet,
shoot it.

465
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:39.240
Or We'd sit out there with grenade launchers and launch grenades at the sh the

466
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:42.290
trash as,
so we try and make it fun,
you know,

467
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.780
but still there's 24 hours in a day and there's not a lot to do on a ship.

468
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.830
Yeah.
So it's was very pretty boring.
And um,
yeah,

469
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:57.720
and for all the listeners to the,
that was the,
the reality pre nine 11,

470
00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:00.730
before there were all these deployments that was,
you know,
you're just so the,

471
00:28:00.731 --> 00:28:02.430
the mission for the [inaudible],
it was just a what

472
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.030
<v 3>to be prepared in a crisis.
It's crisis response force essentially.</v>

473
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.500
And so for us,

474
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:12.501
we actually had the opportunity to do one real world mission responding to the

475
00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:15.060
earthquake in Haiti,
which was like you said,

476
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:19.230
a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
And so,
um,

477
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.100
right off the bat,
as we were getting underway,
uh,

478
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.330
that had happened a couple of weeks before we were scheduled deployed.

479
00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:28.150
So we got on and went down and were able to,
uh,

480
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.490
get involved and help out.

481
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:34.550
So we just flew in with the company Marines and our company was tasked with just

482
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:37.960
helping provide an establish security for a forward staging base.

483
00:28:37.961 --> 00:28:42.630
So logistics area,
uh,
for some of the food and water that they were distributing.

484
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.020
So how bad was it down there?
Pretty terrible.
Uh,

485
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.900
it was really,
really bad.
Um,
we were fluid on a helicopter,

486
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.370
uh,
into the giant dirt field,
which,
you know,
we were bouncing,

487
00:28:56.371 --> 00:28:59.400
see wire and set on fire plants,
sketches and everything just to,

488
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.140
to get everything squared away.
But the level of poverty was pretty,

489
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.720
pretty striking for,
uh,
for us.
I mean,

490
00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:11.610
we had a marine standard post and San and guard and everything and you know,

491
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:16.790
you see for homeless kids between the age eight and 12 sleeping with,

492
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.240
you know,
everything they own and they're,

493
00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:22.500
they're sharing one blanket outside the wire just hanging out,
you know,
uh,

494
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.280
we see like a fist fight,
a drag knockout,
drag down,

495
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:29.040
fist fight between two girls that are age,
whatever,

496
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:33.570
12 and 14 over a piece of wood.
Because firewood is like gold.

497
00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:35.500
There is,
they just don't have wood.

498
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.120
And so that was really,

499
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.550
really eye opening experience for us.
And so what were you guys doing?

500
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.250
Are you guys bringing water?
You bring in medical care and what were you doing?

501
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.790
So,
uh,

502
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.170
the UN was administering all the food and water and so they basically dropped us

503
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:54.460
off and a typical marine corps fashion,
they said,
uh,
you know,

504
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.150
pack light,
you'll only be in there for 24 hours before we relieve you.
And then,

505
00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:01.660
uh,
as we get on the bird,
they're like,
okay,
it might be like 48,
and uh,

506
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.090
by the time we land.
And they were like,
we're not sure what you're getting out.

507
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.240
So,
um,
so you got to stand for about nine days.

508
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.900
And I had to beg,
borrow and steal things there,

509
00:30:10.901 --> 00:30:14.380
but our job was just to literally make sure that,
you know,

510
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.490
overnight they could drop off 60 shipping trailers,

511
00:30:18.491 --> 00:30:20.650
ISO containers of food and water,

512
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.800
and that people weren't gonna who distributed the food and water.

513
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.540
It was primarily the,
you enforced there.
So I think at that time it was a lot of,

514
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.000
uh,
I think it was a primary Brazilian force.

515
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.410
And so they would come in in the morning and his load up and go and distributed.

516
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.540
And I know that was different for a lot of other places,
but for us that was,

517
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.630
that was the mission that we had.
And that was the kind of the way it worked.

518
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.620
So it was a very short temporary stint and then got back on the ships and

519
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.000
steamed across the Atlantic
and then,

520
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.270
and then hit all a bunch of exercises and whatnot.
Like you sat over in the golf.

521
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.360
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

522
00:30:55.361 --> 00:30:59.830
unfortunately we didn't get to do the exercise we'd planned for Israel because

523
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:04.470
we're in Haiti instead.
So we went straight to,
I think it was Jordan.
Uh,

524
00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:08.430
we did,
uh,
infinite moonlight,
I think at that time.
Um,

525
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.650
and we're able to do some basic patrolling with Jordanian soldiers.

526
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:13.770
That was kind of cool actually because,
uh,

527
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.530
not only is Jordan just a amazing country to be in,
but,
um,

528
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.040
those people that were training with were some of the same units that we're

529
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:25.750
going to fight in Afghanistan.
Okay.
And so the Jordanians provided,
uh,

530
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.590
a good contingent of forces to go,
go forward in Afghanistan.
So that was,

531
00:31:29.591 --> 00:31:33.100
that was fun.
I'm getting to work with those guys in the train with those guys.

532
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.590
And then we trained with,
uh,

533
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:40.300
Omani and soldiers and that was pretty interesting as well.
Um,

534
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.980
the thing we learned,
which was really interesting was,
uh,

535
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.290
actual Omanis.
There's not three of a really small population,
so they have,
uh,

536
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.690
at least the units that we were working with had some,
some conscripts from uh,

537
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.940
Pakistan essentially Baluchistan.
Um,

538
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:02.970
and so the officers spoke Arabic and they were Omani but the rest of the platoon

539
00:32:03.191 --> 00:32:07.300
was all Bellucci and you know,
spoke,
uh,
Bellucci.

540
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.490
And so that was kinda interesting to see how that worked.
But,
uh,
you know,

541
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.610
very capable force had a good time no kid fight with those guys.
And so,
yeah,

542
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:21.370
Modern Day conscripts.
Yeah,
and I mean,
they all volunteer.
I mean,
they,
they,

543
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.650
I guess taking the concert might not be the right word.

544
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:24.640
They all volunteered to be there.

545
00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:27.130
And so we talked to girl platoon sergeant and he's like,
hey,

546
00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.790
so it's like a wave in here for money and get a better life for themselves.

547
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.690
So he's like,
Hey,
the deal is I've been here for 20 years,
I love doing this job.

548
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:36.910
I'm able to send money home back to my family and if I make it to 30,

549
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:40.190
they'll let me bring my family over here.
So again,
see his family

550
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.160
<v 2>and 20 years.
But he's,
you know,</v>

551
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.930
trying to better their lot in life by going forward to,
you know,

552
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:49.640
live and fight for another country watch.
You can't,
can't fault him for that.

553
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:53.360
Like,
that's not what I want to work with.
All right,
so you get home,

554
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.540
you get home from that deployment and now it's time to go to,
what's the,

555
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:59.630
what's the long course of Mar Soc?
What's that course called?

556
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.400
It's called individual training course.

557
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:07.210
And so it is a pretty similar to other special forces training courses.

558
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:12.260
So where is it?
It's in North Carolina.
Okay.
I can't believe June.
Uh,

559
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.440
and so we have a small,
uh,
portion of the base there.

560
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:18.890
Now we've established the a pretty sizable compound.

561
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:23.950
And so I'd say probably 80 to 90% of the Marine Special Operations Command as is

562
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:25.370
headquartered there.

563
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.040
And then they have a small west coast contingent out here at Camp Pendleton.

564
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.380
And so the entire school house is there and that's where every operator goes

565
00:33:33.381 --> 00:33:36.470
through training.
And how long is that course?
It's about seven,
eight months.

566
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:41.060
Now what are you doing in that course?
So that is of course,

567
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:44.840
that encompasses all of the basic fundamentals required to join a team and to be

568
00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:46.820
an operator.
So we do,

569
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:51.350
the first phase is some physical training.
Uh,
you know,

570
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:55.890
you do some basic fire support,
some medical training,
you do your sear,
uh,

571
00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:00.740
your full spectrum sere training there.
Uh,
and then you move into some basic,

572
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:04.760
uh,
Sr in patrolling special reconnaissance and basic,
you know,
uh,

573
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.980
reconnaissance skills,
our guys this,

574
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:09.500
so this isn't really a selection course then.
I mean,
you know,

575
00:34:09.501 --> 00:34:13.310
this is a training course,
but,
but like,
but it's pretty high stakes too.

576
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:17.750
And guys are quitting her quit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Plenty of guys quit real.
It's not easy.

577
00:34:17.751 --> 00:34:21.920
Uh,
so we kind of,
uh,
it just,
it the way,
you know,

578
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.170
it just seems like if someone was a marine already and then they made it through

579
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:30.950
that first course and now they show up at this course,
it seems like that's,

580
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:33.770
that's a lot of hoops to jump through to get to there and then quit.

581
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.460
That seems kind of a little bit crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

582
00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:40.280
Well we had some great instructors and,
uh,
they,
uh,

583
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.710
they pushed us hard ride to try to break us.
What did they do it,

584
00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:46.170
what is it like the same?
Is it like the buds type stuff be called beware,

585
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:49.380
be tired,
be measurable?
No sleep is just to get some of that.
Yeah,

586
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:54.950
for the most part,
uh,
kind of a mix of buds and SQT probably mixed together.

587
00:34:54.951 --> 00:34:56.540
And so,
um,

588
00:34:56.930 --> 00:35:00.380
one of the things that they are able to do with within Marsoc is to try to take

589
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.980
lessons learned and best practices from all of the other services.

590
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:05.720
And so whether it was,
you know,

591
00:35:05.721 --> 00:35:10.700
the Q course or bloods or SQT or OTC or anything else,

592
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:15.890
the instructors kind of looked at what was going on in other courses and looked

593
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:20.430
at the requirement for marine Raiders,
uh,
coming out the backside.
Um,

594
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:24.440
cause some of those guys will graduate and we had guys deploy within a month or

595
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:26.720
two later on,
hot fills up to go operate.

596
00:35:26.721 --> 00:35:31.640
So do they put you through like another like crucible type scenario?
Yeah.

597
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:35.540
So it was,
it kind of makes a,
it's called Raider Spirit and oh that's,

598
00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:37.980
that sounds real fun.
That's one

599
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.290
<v 0>of those things like we would get you with a little bit of that raider spirit</v>

600
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:42.380
come and get some,
yeah.
Yeah.

601
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.433
<v 3>It's a,</v>

602
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.370
a varying length depending upon the class and the size and the performance.

603
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:51.350
But uh,
at that point you're trained in,
uh,

604
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:55.410
your amphib package,
your basic small boat handling.
Uh,

605
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:59.400
you're trained in basic reconnaissance and in those principles,

606
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.870
all your comms and everything else.

607
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:05.800
So it's basically a full foot full mission profile for,
you know,

608
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:10.290
including an amphibious insert,
which for us was,
I think like January gets,

609
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:14.970
so maybe.
And so,
uh,
and then same thing,
you know,
limited sleep,

610
00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:18.150
limited water and limited food type thing.
So pretty,

611
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.910
pretty intense.

612
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.240
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
It just seems like a super,</v>

613
00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.840
a burnt the Marine Corps squared away and that's this whole thing.

614
00:36:26.841 --> 00:36:31.310
Sounds like a squared away way to do this because if you look at Budz,

615
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.320
you even have real guns,
most of buds,

616
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.360
you don't even have rifles you're carrying,

617
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.430
you're literally carrying a boat paddle.

618
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.820
They kind of make that your weapon because you can't lose it and you can't put

619
00:36:43.821 --> 00:36:47.900
it down all this stuff.
But it's a boat paddle I need,
you're just,

620
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:53.390
you're so,
you're just so young and untrained,
you know,

621
00:36:53.391 --> 00:36:58.090
you,
you have no skills and so there's no,
it's just,
and they teach you,
you know,

622
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.620
when you get to land warfare,
you teach,
you learn some basic dining,

623
00:37:00.621 --> 00:37:04.370
but the diving that you learn is just so,
so

624
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.990
easy.
Like looking back on it,

625
00:37:07.991 --> 00:37:11.210
it's just the easiest possible things you could possibly do.
Diving.

626
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.530
And the same thing with the land warfare pieces.
Like they're telling you,
hey,

627
00:37:15.531 --> 00:37:19.460
walk this far and they're telling you exactly where to go.
It's not even,

628
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:23.690
it's barely that you do land nav,
but it's barely land nav and it's,

629
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:27.980
and it's good because you know,
it weeds out a lot of people,

630
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.540
but then you have to go through,
like you said,

631
00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:31.640
SQT which comes afterwards and that's where you start learning,
okay,

632
00:37:31.641 --> 00:37:34.840
this is real land Nav.
Okay,
this is real shooting.
Okay,
this is,
you know,

633
00:37:34.841 --> 00:37:35.900
actual real mentorees.

634
00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:39.110
And then you get to a seal team where you go through more training.

635
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.160
But it seems like it,
that's why I was Kinda,

636
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.050
I guess I was kind of surprised that guys that had been through enough stuff

637
00:37:45.051 --> 00:37:49.070
already would get to that and still be like,
oh,
you know,
I don't want to do this.

638
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.180
That seems crazy to me.

639
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.400
<v 3>Yeah,
that's a gut check.
I mean,
um,</v>

640
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.590
and that's one of the things that,
uh,
is interesting.
You know,

641
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.740
bud's does a good job at weeding people out up front.
Uh,

642
00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.420
and so you have a pretty high quality care,
you know,

643
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:09.020
as far as the intangibles,
the ethical and character principles.
Um,

644
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:14.240
and then for us,
you know,
it's a kind of,
I would say more on a sustained

645
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:19.420
<v 0>[inaudible] beat down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so,
I mean,
we started,</v>

646
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:24.680
<v 3>I think we started the course with like 50 or 60 guys and 13 of the original guy</v>

647
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.640
finished,
you know,
and so that's changed a lot since then.

648
00:38:27.641 --> 00:38:30.450
So we've grown up a lot since then.
And just like Bod Taz,
right?
Yeah.

649
00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:34.850
<v 0>Oh yeah.
You know,
I bet back in the day those,
those new mar soc instructors,</v>

650
00:38:34.851 --> 00:38:36.760
like no one's getting through my course.

651
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:40.790
<v 3>Yeah.
And rightfully so.
Um,
but the cool thing about it,
no,</v>

652
00:38:40.791 --> 00:38:42.380
I see both sides of the token.
But,
uh,

653
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.830
the cool thing about it now is that we want more god,
we need more guns.
Yeah.

654
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.910
We don't wanna lower the standards,
so why don't we just be smarter about it,

655
00:38:49.911 --> 00:38:50.744
right.
Like,

656
00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.920
if we do a better job of selecting guides or get more guys starting or whatever

657
00:38:54.921 --> 00:38:59.750
else,
right.
Like if the output is a trained operator and we need,

658
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.900
need these guys then was there any part of that training that you thought was

659
00:39:02.901 --> 00:39:05.570
hard?
Yeah,
a lot of it was hard.

660
00:39:05.571 --> 00:39:10.250
Was there anything that you were in jeopardy on where it was like,
same thing,

661
00:39:10.251 --> 00:39:11.200
right?
So hum.
Yeah,

662
00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.220
Naval Academy was humbling be in the Marine Corps has been humbling.
And uh,

663
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.720
at that point I was a pretty humble guy.
Um,

664
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.790
and so I did really well throughout the majority of training.
And,
uh,

665
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:27.110
so in the last phase,
all feeling good about yourself,

666
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.510
I was okay.
But I said,
you know,

667
00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:33.830
so we were doing the unconventional warfare package,
very similar to,
uh,

668
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.030
very similar,
uh,

669
00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.700
with the green berets do with their final exercise and flowing with the g force

670
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.900
and everything else.
And so it was doing well.
And then,
uh,

671
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.920
had a bad meeting where somebody thought I came off a little bit arrogant with

672
00:39:45.921 --> 00:39:48.790
our g force commander and everything.
And so then they just Kinda,
you know,

673
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.940
put the spotlight on me and put me,
put me on the bubble.
Right.

674
00:39:52.941 --> 00:39:56.070
Cause like you fail anything and you're done.
And so,
yeah,

675
00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.400
that was one of the scarier times,
right?

676
00:39:58.401 --> 00:40:02.390
Cause I had committed years of my life to be able to be doing this successfully.

677
00:40:02.391 --> 00:40:04.660
And then in a moment,
you know,

678
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:08.810
if I can't figure out how to make this guy like me or this g force commander,

679
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.010
you know,
execute this mission with me,
like I'm on the bubble.
Right.
I think,

680
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.530
you know,
some of it's instructors mess around just they're,

681
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.760
they're just testing you,
right?
Like,
you know,
to see how are you going to,

682
00:40:17.761 --> 00:40:19.220
how do you deal with failure?
Right?

683
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:23.630
Because if you've been successful thus far in a,
a good number of things,
uh,

684
00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.880
let's push them beyond as limit.
Let's break them and see what happens.
Right.
And,

685
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.450
and I don't know if that was exactly the case.
I didn't see behind the curtain,

686
00:40:29.451 --> 00:40:30.740
but I survived.

687
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:34.060
<v 0>I failed something called pool competency.
Mm.</v>

688
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.860
And I failed pool competency,
which is they put,
they put your dive rig on,

689
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:41.140
which is an old school dive rig with a,

690
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.070
with an inhalation and exhalation tube.

691
00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:49.480
And it's this and this old thing from like the sixties or seventies or
something,

692
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.910
aqua lung.
And,
uh,

693
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.960
you have to do all this stuff that they tell you to do underwater and they're,

694
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.790
they're slapping you around and smashing you and ripping your mask off and rest,

695
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.560
ripping the regulator out in all this stuff and you have to stay calm and you

696
00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:03.910
have to go through all these procedures.

697
00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:09.040
And when I went through it was a 30 minute evolution.
And,

698
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.600
uh,
the first time I did it,

699
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:15.120
my instructor who ended up working for me in the future,
he was a,
well,

700
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.650
he was a first class at the time,
but he became a warrant officer.

701
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.280
Breeza Udt Vietnam Guy,
an awesome guy.
But he failed me.

702
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:26.100
And um,
yeah.
And so I failed them.

703
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.550
Years later I talked to him and was like,
Hey,

704
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:29.230
do you remember putting me through Paul Glazier?
Yeah,

705
00:41:29.231 --> 00:41:33.000
I was just messing with you.
I'm like,
oh,
you almost ruined my life.

706
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.450
Are you talking about your dismay?
He goes,
no,
I knew you do find next time.

707
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.400
Same thing.
Like it was a test of,
let's just see how this guy does,

708
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.720
but what we did over the weekend,
me and a couple buddies that were,

709
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.380
that had also failed.
We went in the dip tank,

710
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:53.410
which was just a square metal box and that was filled with water and we pool

711
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:56.540
comp to each other.
This,
I don't even,
I can't even believe we did this.

712
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:58.080
It was probably the most unsafe thing I've,

713
00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:03.310
I did or one of the top unsafe things I did was we drown each other and trashed

714
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:07.190
each other getting ready and we did it to each other over and over again until

715
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.160
we were like,
there's no way we're going to fail.
And so that's what we did.

716
00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:13.010
Like there's four of us or something who just spent the weekend in the,

717
00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:15.020
I don't even,
I can't even believe they let us do that.

718
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.510
They just gave us dive gear and so you're just gonna play with the dive gear.

719
00:42:17.511 --> 00:42:21.950
Cool.
We're in the dip tank link ads,
different time,
right?
Yeah.

720
00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.940
Yeah.
But it is humbling and it's one of those things,
you know,

721
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:30.290
there's no worse feeling for me then that feeling of like,
Oh,
if I fail this,

722
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:35.360
this is,
this is like my whole life dream done and destroyed.

723
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.200
So yeah,
they make,
they play those,
uh,

724
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.350
they play those games with you and I think they have to play those games with

725
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:46.190
you because you're going to fail in other situations once you get to the,

726
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.780
to the teams,
you know,
you want it,

727
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.850
you do want to see how people are going to deal with failure.

728
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.870
And they would do things like that in bud's where,
you know,
they would,

729
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.520
there would be seven people that would pass a swim and everyone else is a

730
00:42:58.521 --> 00:43:00.470
failure and they'd,
you know,
tell us needle,

731
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.530
they line us all up and make every single,

732
00:43:03.531 --> 00:43:07.820
make a hundred guys sign a chit that we were losing her failures on the swim.

733
00:43:07.821 --> 00:43:10.400
And if they fail,
if we fail again,
we're going to be dropped from training.

734
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.070
I don't think that was actually true.
I don't know.

735
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.040
But it didn't say looking back at the time,
I believed at the time I was like,

736
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:19.070
oh my God.
So they do a good job of that.

737
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:22.730
A psychological warfare on you when that training

738
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.650
before that too,
that you know another pretty intense phase.

739
00:43:27.651 --> 00:43:31.700
So we did the CQB initial CQB phase,
uh,
prior to that too.

740
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.440
And so that one was same thing that was pretty high stakes,
pretty high,
you know,

741
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:40.230
high stress.
Did you mess up?
No,
I,
I was,
I was okay there.
Yeah.

742
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:45.290
I didn't have any issues but thrown rounds.
He shoot me any hostages?
Nah,

743
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:49.640
I shot a hostage one time.
Oh yeah,
I shot a hot just in training.
But yeah,

744
00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:54.560
obviously just in training,
but this guy,
they had a target set up,
you know,
those,

745
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:58.020
those,
they look like a water color painting targets that,

746
00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.950
so there are different characters and you can take little,

747
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:05.720
you could take the person's hand and you could paste over like a pistol or a

748
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:09.050
cell phone or a badge or a whatever.

749
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.590
So I come into this room and it's,
it's kind of dusk and this was,

750
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.050
this was back in the day,
so we didn't even use night vision.

751
00:44:15.051 --> 00:44:16.310
This is just like day,
you know,

752
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:20.390
we just shooting with our eyesight or regular eyesight and I come in and there's

753
00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:25.391
a guy and I look at his hands and I see like a dark pipe pointed at me and I

754
00:44:26.511 --> 00:44:28.990
drilled this dude,
you know,
to,
to the chest warranted

755
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:35.040
and we get done with a run and the instructor,
he comes out and he's like,

756
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.610
he's holding the target in his hands and he's like,
he's like,
Hey Jocko,

757
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.020
look at this.
And I was like,
check.
And he goes,
what do you see?

758
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.010
And what it was was it was allegedly,

759
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:51.630
it was a rolled up newspaper that he was pointing at the,
at the,

760
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:52.890
at you,
you know,

761
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.660
at me and it looked like of the barrel of a gun.

762
00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:00.570
And I,
and I looked to the instructor,
I was like,
hey bro,

763
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:04.980
if I come into a room and someone's doing that,
they're going to die.
I'm sorry.

764
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:08.970
Maybe you can't do that.
Cause the guy looks all jacked.
He's this guy,

765
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:10.380
this guy with the green shirt.

766
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:12.840
I'm gonna find one of these and post it because I'm sure you can find them.

767
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.700
It's the guy with the green shirt,

768
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.730
super thick neck and looks all hostile and aggressive.

769
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.110
And he's pointing this pipe at me and I drilled him and I got in trouble.

770
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:25.110
That was my,
you know,
I had it,
whatever,
had to run a tire or something like that.

771
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:30.510
But um,
that was when I was in the teams that was,
you know,
hey,
yeah,

772
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:32.940
horrible.
Then you do,
you know,
even even though I was like,
Hey,

773
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:36.060
I'll do that anyways,
but inside and you know,
even though I was like,
man,
that,

774
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:38.310
you know,
you gotta be better than that.
And that was a,

775
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.010
that was jacked up for me to do that.
And so I had to check hands more carefully,

776
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.620
hadn't be more patient and taking that shot to make sure what I'm looking at is

777
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:51.150
what I'm looking at.
So yeah,
failure is a good teacher and it's very humbling.

778
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:56.910
And then,
so do you guys have like a full on graduation ceremony from that?

779
00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:01.190
Do you get a hint?
Do you get that,
that new raider pity?
Yeah,

780
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:02.370
and we didn't have one at the time.

781
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:06.590
<v 3>So we've,
uh,
we've grown up,
we weren't called Raiders and we didn't have a pen,</v>

782
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:10.460
so we just got a little certificate and handshake and sent on her way.

783
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:14.330
And then you went to where?
Uh,
and then I was assigned to Camp Pendleton,

784
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.110
California.

785
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:18.440
So I moved out here with my wife and enjoyed First Marine Raider Battalion.

786
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.730
And uh,
and that was your first time being out at Pendleton,
correct?
Yeah.

787
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:26.090
How he liked Penelton.
I love it.
It's awesome.
It's still live here.

788
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.330
I didn't make it far,
even though my wife's family,

789
00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:32.660
all her family is still in Delaware,
so we,
uh,
we love it here.

790
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.150
I hope to never lose its Pendleton.
Is,

791
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:40.790
is awesome training ground,
I mean,
really awesome training ground.

792
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:44.210
Yes.
Yeah,
it's great.
Great place to train.
Uh,

793
00:46:44.211 --> 00:46:47.900
we did a lot of our training there and a typical places out in the desert in

794
00:46:47.901 --> 00:46:51.170
Alec,
Fort Irwin and couple of other places.
But yeah,
it's,

795
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.890
it's good and it's massive.
I had no idea how big it was,
but just huge.

796
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:56.960
And then how long was that workup for?

797
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:02.840
We had saw arrived in August and I was in the three shop and the operations

798
00:47:02.841 --> 00:47:07.841
section before I went to a team for about two months and then we deployed in

799
00:47:08.391 --> 00:47:12.890
May,
so about nine months that I was with the team,
they had done their,

800
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.940
uh,

801
00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:18.620
the workup cycle I think was probably similar to what the seal teams had done

802
00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:20.150
where it's,
you know,
you come back,

803
00:47:20.151 --> 00:47:22.580
you go back and you immediately guys are shotgunned out to schools,

804
00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.580
individual training and then come back to collective training and then deploy.

805
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.320
So I had gotten there,
right one,

806
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.080
it was trickling back in from a lot of the individual schools that they were

807
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:35.500
going to.
And then how big is the team that you take over?

808
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.890
We had 20 total with attachments.

809
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.900
And so each team is about 14 or not about exactly 14.

810
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.350
Uh,
so there's,
you know,
small headquarters element and then,
uh,

811
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.490
two forming elements to a corpsman,

812
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.480
medics and,
um,
and then we plussed up with,
uh,

813
00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.910
our Intel assets and EOD and,
uh,
gotten country,

814
00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:03.460
got some dog antlers and some other stuff as well with our team.

815
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:06.460
<v 0>And then,
and that,
when you say got in country,
this is,
this is you to,</v>

816
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:10.700
you deployed to Afghanistan?
Yes.
Now it's 2012,

817
00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.480
<v 3>correct?
Yeah,
2012.</v>

818
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:17.630
So I'd gotten out of training 2011 and then deployed in May of 2012.

819
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.510
<v 0>And then what was that,
when you are going into that deployment,</v>

820
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:25.960
what was the atmosphere in Afghanistan at that time?

821
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.870
<v 3>The atmosphere was different depending upon the region you were in.
Very,</v>

822
00:48:30.871 --> 00:48:33.330
very different.
So,
uh,

823
00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:36.180
where we were going was highly Connecticut,

824
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:39.210
a bad guy that's running around all over the place,

825
00:48:39.211 --> 00:48:43.830
just kill or be killed and uh,
focusing a lot on security and combat operations.

826
00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:49.200
Um,
and so there were two mission sets that our teams would,

827
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:51.300
uh,
would perform.
Uh,

828
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.600
either they would be doing a program called village stability operations,

829
00:48:54.601 --> 00:48:55.381
which is what we were doing,

830
00:48:55.381 --> 00:48:58.690
where they would be assigned to a commando can deck battalion,

831
00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:03.600
which is more like Afghanistan's version of ranger regimen or anything else.

832
00:49:03.601 --> 00:49:06.930
And so when we deployed,
we deployed a with the company,

833
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.520
so we had three marine teams.

834
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.790
One of our teams took over a commando mission and then the other two were doing

835
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:16.250
village stability operations.
Um,
and then as we,
uh,
deployed,

836
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.580
we took over a couple of seal units and uh,

837
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.890
Greenbrae team as well that reported to our,
our company headquarters as well.

838
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:27.780
So specifically for our team where we went,
we were in very,

839
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:31.380
very primitive rural area in the middle of the Helmand province,
uh,

840
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:35.040
right in the Green Zone.
And,
uh,
so the,

841
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:38.780
<v 0>which Green Zone means something different in Afghanistan than it did in Iraq.</v>

842
00:49:38.781 --> 00:49:43.160
Green Zone in Iraq was an area in Baghdad actually that was,

843
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.200
that was controlled and safe and,

844
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:51.140
and all good to go for Americans.
And there was,
you know,

845
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.710
other people live in there and whatnot.
Is Exhibit a safe zone.

846
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.860
And the Green Zone in Afghanistan is not that.

847
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.490
<v 3>No.
So the Green Zone in Afghanistan literally is,
uh,
due to vegetation.</v>

848
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.740
And so the Green Zone,

849
00:50:05.741 --> 00:50:10.741
Afghanistan is mostly arid or desert climate and there's very little green areas

850
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:16.210
are good farmland to essentially,
and I'm think it was in the 60s,
uh,

851
00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:17.523
I think it was,
uh,

852
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.670
the USAID or another international development agency built another canal off of

853
00:50:21.671 --> 00:50:22.504
the Helmand river.

854
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.930
And so in between those two waterways was good farmland cause uh,

855
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.240
farmers there would,
you know,
cut out canals and everything else to grow crops.

856
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:37.100
And so this was like one of the only green areas in the entire country.

857
00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:38.570
Um,
it's,
that's what they,

858
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:42.070
they mean even the Afghanistan version of the green zone and sensitive

859
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.790
vegetation is also cover and concealment for fighters,

860
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.940
for enemy fighters.
Yeah.
And so where we were,
it was,

861
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:53.750
it was tough because guys would use those canals to sneak up and it was very

862
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:57.580
undulating,
are hilly terrain.
Um,
I would consider,

863
00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.470
and when I talked tried to explain it to most people too,
I consider it more,

864
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.220
more similar to trench warfare then just desert open warfare where you can see

865
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.160
other people,
um,
people are very able to,

866
00:51:10.161 --> 00:51:14.450
especially with some of the urban structures there as well.
Uh,

867
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.350
some of them he fires would be able to creep up and,
and you know,

868
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:22.520
try to get the drop on you and get close to your position.
So these V,

869
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:23.850
so you were doing VSL,

870
00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:28.580
you the v village stability operations and what did that,
what did kind of,

871
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:33.080
what was your standard VSL mission look like?
What was that deal?

872
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:37.700
So for the VSO mission,
we had three lines of effort.

873
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:43.030
So the first was to establish security and the second was to try to revive

874
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.420
economic development.
And then the third was to link political governance.

875
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.350
So the three lines of effort,

876
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.620
security development and governance for political governance

877
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.300
couldn't really focus on economic development or political governance if the

878
00:51:56.301 --> 00:51:59.720
villagers didn't have security.
And so one of the first things that we did,

879
00:51:59.721 --> 00:52:02.510
and we took over a pretty capable force because people had been doing this

880
00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:06.610
mission a lot before us in this region.
They would,
uh,

881
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.330
train and equip a small police force called the Afghan local police.

882
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:16.900
And so the idea was was if you take people in these small communities that are

883
00:52:17.331 --> 00:52:21.470
from there,
train them,
pay them to prod security,

884
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:24.440
that they would be more effective at providing security than any Americans would

885
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:29.390
be.
Um,
which is in most cases very true.
And so we took over,

886
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.020
uh,
this site and we had about,

887
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:38.150
I think probably a hundred or more Afghans that run our payrolls to help go and

888
00:52:38.151 --> 00:52:43.130
provide security for the area.
And so that was primarily what we focused on,

889
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:46.680
um,
because we were still trying to train them,

890
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.360
get them to a place where they could provide security for themselves.

891
00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:53.600
This multiple villages in like an area that you're,

892
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:56.300
that you're providing security for,
that these Afghans are providing security,

893
00:52:56.301 --> 00:53:00.260
or is it like one big,
you know,
like larger village?
For us,

894
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:04.370
it was just one village and it wasn't even,
I mean,
it wasn't even that big,

895
00:53:04.371 --> 00:53:07.870
honestly.
So we literally,
uh,
as far as,
uh,

896
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:13.200
operational areas and things,
I think ours was a few kilometers Max.
So we were,

897
00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:18.140
yeah,
because super focused where we were was,
um,

898
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.920
essentially a minefield to be right in the middle of this,
this contested region,

899
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.040
prime poppy,
growing,
uh,
area.

900
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.410
So Taliban wanted it and the farmers would grow poppy,

901
00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:31.680
and that was their economic,
you know,
that was there.
Their payday,

902
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.810
their paychecks.
Um,

903
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:37.610
and so very complex problem to try to change.
Uh,

904
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.030
and so we,

905
00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:42.840
<v 0>so did you live in the villages?
Did you live there?
Yeah.</v>

906
00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.370
So you took over some houses or whatever,
and then you set up your,

907
00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.410
your base of operations and you live there

908
00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.500
<v 3>essentially.
Yeah,
we took,
basically,</v>

909
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:55.540
we weren't able to really take over any houses because all the houses that run

910
00:53:55.541 --> 00:53:57.340
occupied world full of Ids.

911
00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:01.450
So the TTP and base of what we had done at that time was,
uh,

912
00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:03.460
wherever we were going to set up,

913
00:54:03.461 --> 00:54:07.600
we would bulldoze and just build structures on our own.
You know,
Hasko barriers,

914
00:54:07.601 --> 00:54:09.880
but it was very primitive.
We had no running water,

915
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:14.830
just living in a dust bowl essentially.
Um,
get some towers up for security.

916
00:54:14.831 --> 00:54:16.450
And then it was pretty much it.

917
00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.540
<v 0>And there's how many of you out in this remote location?</v>

918
00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.070
<v 3>We ended up having two sites.</v>

919
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.610
And so we had mutually supporting positions within our team.

920
00:54:25.611 --> 00:54:30.611
And I think we had probably 60 Americans.

921
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.230
So we had our 20 guys.
And then we actually had a trailer,

922
00:54:33.231 --> 00:54:36.950
platoon of army infantry guys out there as well.

923
00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:40.730
And so they would help provide security in San Posts and allow us to go out and

924
00:54:40.731 --> 00:54:41.564
do missions.

925
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:45.190
<v 0>So now you get into doing missions and what does that look like?</v>

926
00:54:45.191 --> 00:54:49.570
You're going out,
you,
you,
you have to take people,

927
00:54:49.571 --> 00:54:52.180
you have to move people,
you have to go and meet people.

928
00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:56.620
Like what was the kind of standard,
um,
when you,

929
00:54:56.621 --> 00:55:00.940
when you say mission to execute from those little forward operating basis,

930
00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.880
what was kind of the standard mission that you would execute?
Cute.

931
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:08.740
<v 3>Yeah.
So the mission is varied,
but for the most part,
uh,</v>

932
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.720
and I was only there for about two months before I had gotten injured in,

933
00:55:12.721 --> 00:55:14.520
came back.
But,
um,

934
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:18.570
the team we took over for had done a really good job and they had some very

935
00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:22.770
challenging human dynamics within the EO.

936
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:27.440
Um,
they're gonna attacked multiple times a day.
So,
uh,

937
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.330
when we got there,
we tried to do whatever we could to,

938
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:33.000
to proactively prevent that from happening.

939
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:37.710
And so the standard practice that we would do is,

940
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.990
uh,
we'd go outside of those patrols,

941
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:44.910
try to find guys who were coming to kill us and kill them before they got us.
So,

942
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:49.500
uh,
to do that is not an insignificant task,

943
00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.310
especially when you're going through a minefield.
Uh,

944
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.510
and so the TTPs that we kind of use at that time was we would go into the cover

945
00:55:57.511 --> 00:55:58.540
of darkness,
uh,

946
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:04.040
which will allow us time to slowly and methodically get to where we wanted to

947
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:08.490
go,
uh,
take over a compound or a building,
um,

948
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.340
and then just stay there all day and observe and see what happened.

949
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.450
And then that next night,
usually exfil under the cover of darkness again.

950
00:56:15.451 --> 00:56:19.890
And the Maine Mainers we did that was because a lot of the ideas that were out

951
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.070
and uh,
set up,
we're in positions

952
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.900
<v 4>where they're just so many of them and they're in positions that were</v>

953
00:56:28.901 --> 00:56:32.980
advantageous and it would be observed by the enemy.
And so if

954
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.320
an entire compound had a few different ads in it,
and we started to realize that,

955
00:56:38.321 --> 00:56:39.010
hey,
we,

956
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:42.220
we can't go on these compounds or we can't go near them because if there's

957
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:42.641
nobody in it,

958
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:46.240
most of the time they have [inaudible] the enemy would then wait until we were

959
00:56:46.241 --> 00:56:51.040
in a position and just fire a few shots at us trying to drive us into those

960
00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.800
positions and things.
And so just in general,

961
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:56.620
we just prefer to operate at night because,
uh,

962
00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:59.350
they didn't have night vision capabilities that weren't able to shoot at us at

963
00:56:59.351 --> 00:56:59.711
night.

964
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:04.711
And we were able to take our time and move very slowly and methodically through

965
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.210
the IED threat that we encountered.

966
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:12.070
And so that's how we were able to try to mitigate that.
Um,
and that was,

967
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.340
you know,
how we would usually conduct those missions and then

968
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:19.560
<v 2>there,
how often would you actually get contact and once you are out set up in an</v>

969
00:57:19.561 --> 00:57:20.394
ambush possession,

970
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:26.300
<v 4>I think almost almost a hundred percent of the time it felt like that at least.</v>

971
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:30.310
Um,
and so we wouldn't go out everyday.
Uh,

972
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.440
so we'd stagger the Edis and obviously with the operational,
you know,

973
00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:35.320
the number of people that we had.
Um,

974
00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.180
we're trying to maximize the bang for our buck and,

975
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:42.590
and to be very efficient with that while also running other operations and

976
00:57:42.591 --> 00:57:45.860
trying to build the police force and other types of,
you know,

977
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:51.110
upward lines of operation.
Um,
and so we'd go probably every few days.

978
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.930
<v 2>So this is a very aggressive VSO.
Meshan yeah,</v>

979
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:57.830
I mean this is more aggressive than I was thinking.

980
00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:03.020
The term that was thrown around by some of the guys was smash mouth VSO.

981
00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:04.790
Uh,
and so,
Oh,

982
00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:09.180
<v 4>if you look at the entire landscape of Afghanistan from the highest levels of</v>

983
00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:13.080
command and everything,
there were,
you know,
green,
yellow and red areas.

984
00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:18.090
And if you look at that based on enemy activity or friendliness to coalition

985
00:58:18.091 --> 00:58:21.540
forces,
the traditional model for VSO was,
hey,

986
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:26.250
put them in yellow areas that,
you know,
we're likely to be successful.

987
00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:30.090
We can make some progress,
not in red areas,
right,

988
00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:32.590
where people will just fight to the death and you know,

989
00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:36.000
there's no chance of this happening.
And so,
uh,

990
00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.350
different people have different thoughts of what's green,
yellow and red.
And so,

991
00:58:40.351 --> 00:58:41.184
uh,

992
00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:45.000
when we ended up there and that was our mission and we tried to make the most of

993
00:58:45.001 --> 00:58:48.000
it.
So,
but yeah,
very different.
And so that,
and we even had teams,

994
00:58:48.001 --> 00:58:51.120
other marines were out in the west and Herat province,
uh,

995
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:53.970
which was very different than the Helmand province.
And so out in Herat province,

996
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:56.070
guys are,
you know,

997
00:58:56.490 --> 00:59:00.280
walking around with just a pistol and driving on motorbikes and,
you know,

998
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:05.460
drinking tea and hanging out,
no helmets,
like,
you know,
not getting shot at very,

999
00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:10.170
very,
very different experience than,
than where we were.
Um,

1000
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:14.350
and that,
that was great cause,
you know,
we're just glad different places of,

1001
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.540
you know,
different portions of the country.

1002
00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:19.500
We were successful with that mission set.
And I think to a large degree,

1003
00:59:19.501 --> 00:59:22.040
most of the,
the special operations that conduct that mission,

1004
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:26.270
we're very successful.
Um,
and for us,
you know,

1005
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.980
it's debatable how successful we were,
but that was a very different environment.

1006
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:34.490
Yeah.
I know there were guys that were going over to do it and they would ask me

1007
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:35.051
about,
you know,

1008
00:59:35.051 --> 00:59:37.820
of what do you think of this and we're going to do this village civility thing.

1009
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.220
And I was like,
Oh,
you're going to go out into the middle of,
you know,

1010
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:43.160
Indian country with your platoon.

1011
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:47.330
That's going to be an awesome mission.
Like it's going to be great.
Go get some,

1012
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:51.140
go do a do good job.
I mean that's just a,
it's a cool mission.

1013
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:53.660
It's just to be out there on your own.
I mean,

1014
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:57.520
how much oversight did you have out there?
Not much.

1015
00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:58.941
I mean,
and that was,

1016
00:59:58.941 --> 01:00:02.840
that was one of the coolest things was having the freedom to go and execute.

1017
01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:03.501
And so,
you know,

1018
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:08.150
whether or not it was destined for success based on what the situation was,

1019
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:10.790
we were going to do the best we could to,
to make it success.

1020
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.390
And we had a lot of resources to do that.
Whether it was,
you know,

1021
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:18.770
the intelligence assets that we had at our disposal,
uh,
you know,

1022
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:23.180
as a captain in the Marine Corps had assets that were like more than a new

1023
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:27.680
commander.
Right.
Uh,
and same thing for casts and air support.

1024
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:33.050
Um,
Roe was a bit restrictive for conventional forces and for us,

1025
01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:37.010
you know,
we were able to,
as long as we met certain criteria and,
and you know,

1026
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:41.930
able to justify it,
we're able to drop cast where we needed to.
Um,

1027
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:43.730
you know,
which was very different.

1028
01:00:43.731 --> 01:00:46.430
And so we did the best we could and made the most of it.

1029
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:52.630
And then you're a couple months into deployment and that's when you got,

1030
01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.710
that's when you got wounded.
Yeah.
And what,
what happened on that op?
Yeah,

1031
01:00:57.711 --> 01:01:02.711
so we're starting to have some successes with the security bubble that we were

1032
01:01:03.321 --> 01:01:05.280
establishing.
And so,
uh,

1033
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:09.350
we pushed a little bit further from our base to try to see where we thought

1034
01:01:09.351 --> 01:01:11.180
there would be any activity.
And so we went about,

1035
01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.840
I think maybe a click and a half on foot from her base and found ourselves in

1036
01:01:17.391 --> 01:01:22.190
Indian country essentially.
So we occupied a compound a on the cover of darkness.

1037
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:27.370
And shortly after the sun rose immediately started seeing heavy activity around

1038
01:01:28.371 --> 01:01:32.930
us and started getting engaged from a multiple directions with,

1039
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.300
with different weapons systems.
And so,
uh,

1040
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:40.510
shortly after that happened,
there were three marines in,

1041
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:44.690
on the rooftop of the compound that we're in.
Uh,

1042
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:47.380
we have the rest of marines down,
surrounded,
protective,
or excuse me,

1043
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:49.900
protected by the rest of the compound walls.

1044
01:01:49.901 --> 01:01:53.810
So most of the construction in Afghanistan is mud,
mud huts.

1045
01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:57.890
Um,
and despite not having running water or electricity or anything,

1046
01:01:58.610 --> 01:02:01.820
they were able to build these massive fortifications around each house.

1047
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:05.210
And so the walls would protect you,
but you can't see anything.

1048
01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.000
So you also don't have situational awareness on what's going on.

1049
01:02:08.001 --> 01:02:10.320
And so as a commander,
as a leader of the patrol,
uh,

1050
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:12.650
swapped out with Brian Jacqueline,

1051
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:17.660
who was on the rooftop at that time to try to get awareness and so started

1052
01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:21.560
observing different things going on.
And,
and you know,
as I was up there,

1053
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:25.890
an enemy fighter head,
uh,
engage us from our flank.

1054
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:29.520
And so myself and another marine on the rooftop were shot.

1055
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.090
A third marine was able to roll off without getting shot.

1056
01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:36.960
And so immediately a bullet went into my shoulder and into my spine.

1057
01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:40.860
And so I just felt a pulsing sensation in my back and kind of slumped over.

1058
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:44.430
Saw Ricky,
who was the sergeant to my left.

1059
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.720
He had been shot through the neck and was facedown on the rooftop.
Uh,

1060
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:50.610
try to triage myself,

1061
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.000
pick myself up and realize that nothing below my chest was working.

1062
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:57.030
And so I immediately got on the radio,
called me,
guys,

1063
01:02:57.031 --> 01:02:59.960
told him that I'd been hit and that Rick had been hit and,
uh,

1064
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:00.930
they sprung into action.

1065
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:06.030
And so took the initiative to return fire,

1066
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:10.050
gain,
fire superiority and tree.
How Jocelyn and continue to fight.

1067
01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.370
And how long did that last?
It was a long time.

1068
01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.090
<v 0>I mean,</v>

1069
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:20.060
you're out there in the middle of nowhere and you're in a really hostile

1070
01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:23.330
situation.
How long did it take to get assets there?

1071
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:29.170
<v 4>Assets were pretty timely.
Um,
but it was also a very chaotic situation.</v>

1072
01:03:29.171 --> 01:03:34.171
So at that time we had 10 Americans out on the mission.

1073
01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:38.310
Uh,
we had 10 of our Afghan partner force with us.
Uh,

1074
01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:42.910
and so now we're down to eight Americans to are critically wounded.

1075
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.000
We'd pull guns off the line as well to treat us,
saw our medic,

1076
01:03:46.001 --> 01:03:49.270
immediately started treating Ricky and I,
another marine,

1077
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:51.940
start treating me as well as at least six.
Uh,

1078
01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:56.560
Brian Jacqueline immediately got on the radio and started to try to,

1079
01:03:57.170 --> 01:04:01.250
uh,
call in for Medivac and air support.
Um,

1080
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.630
at that same moment,
Murphy's law kicked in as well,

1081
01:04:04.631 --> 01:04:08.080
and the Satcom antenna came down and source that coming pen and came down.

1082
01:04:08.081 --> 01:04:08.890
So we're now,

1083
01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:13.540
Brian was relaying through our main position all the information that was going

1084
01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:17.100
on.
And so,
uh,
getting pretty chaotic,
um,

1085
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:22.030
and took about I think 30 minutes or so before the,

1086
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:26.380
uh,
Medivac helicopters are able to come in and get us out.

1087
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:35.150
<v 0>And,
and,
and how bad was that?
What was the other guy's name that was hit Rick.</v>

1088
01:04:35.151 --> 01:04:39.470
Ricky.
Yeah.
So he got shot in the neck.
Like what,
what was that all about?

1089
01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:44.930
Yeah,
and he was dead.
Yeah.
And,
um,
it turns out he

1090
01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.890
<v 4>was very,
very,
very lucky.
So missed everything important in his neck,</v>

1091
01:04:48.891 --> 01:04:51.500
missed his windpipe.
Mr Spine.
Uh,

1092
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:55.440
he was unconscious for a while and we were both off the rooftop and,
uh,

1093
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.280
our medic,
uh,
started working on him,

1094
01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:00.950
trying to bring him back to life while another marine was trying to keep me

1095
01:05:00.951 --> 01:05:03.260
stable.
And so,
uh,

1096
01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.760
put some click a lot and different clotting agents in his neck.

1097
01:05:07.761 --> 01:05:12.170
And all of a sudden Rick kind of woke up and made like a Zombie and it was like,

1098
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.920
ah,
he was like blinking and stuff.
And so it turned out fine.

1099
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:19.690
And Luckily today he's,
you know,
he's left the service,
but he just,

1100
01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:22.630
he's about to graduate from college.
He's in a bodybuilding and you know,

1101
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.390
he's doing great,
which is awesome.

1102
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:30.390
And so at that time he was pretty stable.
And,
uh,

1103
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.950
I started to take a little bit of a turn for the worst because the bullet went

1104
01:05:32.951 --> 01:05:33.784
in my shoulder.

1105
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:37.900
It also kind of punctured one of my lungs and sent her to have blood pooling in

1106
01:05:37.901 --> 01:05:42.130
my,
uh,
the left side of my chest cavity.
And so,
uh,

1107
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.900
guys were trying to get us out of there.
So he was conscious.
I was,
yeah,

1108
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.140
yeah,
for the most part until towards,
towards the end where I started to,

1109
01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.513
to fade a little bit.

1110
01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:55.920
<v 0>And then did you,
did you eventually just,
did you pass out,</v>

1111
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:57.750
they hit you with morphine?
Would they,
would they do,

1112
01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:00.150
<v 4>I didn't get any drugs until,</v>

1113
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.090
I don't think I got to get drugs until I got on the helicopter.
And then,
uh,

1114
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.830
while I was on the helicopter passed out and woke up in a hospital in

1115
01:06:07.831 --> 01:06:10.740
Afghanistan.
But I do remember the event.

1116
01:06:10.741 --> 01:06:14.640
And so I remember making the radio call to my teammates swallows on the rooftop,

1117
01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:19.080
remember getting pulled down,
remember talking to a huffys.
Uh,

1118
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:23.880
one of the Marines who was working on me,
uh,
talking him through a Needle d,
uh,

1119
01:06:23.881 --> 01:06:27.990
as he was giving me a needle,
trying to tell him and talked to him and stuff.

1120
01:06:27.991 --> 01:06:31.890
And he said,
uh,
you know,
he said some side,

1121
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:34.680
it said some interesting things while I was there too.
And uh,
you know,

1122
01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.530
<v 0>so just to give people a little bit of a visual on that,</v>

1123
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.680
a needle decompression is when you're,
when somebody is going to take a what,

1124
01:06:43.681 --> 01:06:48.681
like a 14 gauge needle or something like that and jam it in between your ribs

1125
01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:52.590
into your lung cavity to allow some pressure out.

1126
01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.830
And you had to talk him through that.

1127
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:57.950
<v 4>He knew what he was doing,
but I was just,
you know,</v>

1128
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:59.760
just trying to encourage them in different things.

1129
01:06:59.761 --> 01:07:03.930
And so at that time it was also trying to relay information to help them find

1130
01:07:03.931 --> 01:07:06.650
the bad guys.
And it was fine who they were trying to,
uh,

1131
01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:09.710
return fire for or against.
And so,
uh,

1132
01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:13.410
it was talking to him on try to talk them on initially and then after that it

1133
01:07:13.411 --> 01:07:16.440
was just trying to talk to them to make sure,
make you know,

1134
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.750
and then the helicopters and sat down in your compound.
No,
they couldn't.

1135
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.530
So that was a big challenge.
And so,
uh,

1136
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.390
what happened and what Brian Jacqueline was awarded the Navy Cross for a and a

1137
01:07:30.391 --> 01:07:35.391
lot of other guys who all risk their lives to save ours did was they had to call

1138
01:07:36.061 --> 01:07:40.710
him the helicopters out into an open field,
uh,
despite being under fire.

1139
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:43.830
And so they prepped the area with as much air support as they could call it in

1140
01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:46.370
the bird.
And the bird landed.
Uh,

1141
01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:49.890
Brian blew a breach in the compound wall through smoke.

1142
01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:53.310
And then literally what he said was,
if you get hit on the way to the chopper,

1143
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:57.120
jump in,
follow me.
And led the way.
And without hesitation,

1144
01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:02.460
the other guys carried this out to the open and not a small guy.

1145
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:06.060
You know what,
I'm 200 pounds of barrel chested freedom fighter,

1146
01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:10.860
just like most of us with an,
you know,
a lot of lot of kid on too.
And so,

1147
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:13.700
uh,
those guys carrying us out there,

1148
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:16.640
we're in a a polis and so to carry us,

1149
01:08:16.641 --> 01:08:18.530
it takes four guys and they can't return fire.

1150
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.340
They can't pick up their weapon and engage the enemy.

1151
01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.150
So they're totally exposed and without hesitation,

1152
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.970
ran out there and doing the bullet dance dodging bullets,

1153
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:30.740
trying to get us on the bird and get us out of there.

1154
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.550
And I'm alive today because of that.
And so that for me,

1155
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.960
what I tell people when I talk about this is,
is one of the best days of my life.

1156
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.060
And so I was one of the worst days of my life to cause I suffered a spinal cord

1157
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:48.860
injury and was paralyzed from the chest down for however long that may be.

1158
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:54.430
But I was one of the best days of my life because a team that I was fortunate

1159
01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:58.640
enough to lead a team that I was fortunate enough to be a part of display.

1160
01:08:58.641 --> 01:08:59.930
The highest levels of,

1161
01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:05.000
of selflessness and sacrifice and courage on the battlefield.
Uh,

1162
01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.230
and just to witness that and to be a part of that,
you know,

1163
01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.790
is something I'll never forget and it's up and I'll be proud of for the rest of

1164
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:12.430
my life.
So,
uh,

1165
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.350
<v 0>yeah.
And if in case anyone missed it,</v>

1166
01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:20.120
the opening for this was actually,
um,
those are,

1167
01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:23.420
those are a gunnery sergeant Jacqueline's words that he,

1168
01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:26.510
that he gave during a speech and I thought they were just so,
uh,

1169
01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:28.250
they were just awesome words,

1170
01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.690
so I figured I'd share them with some people and obviously the rest of the guys,

1171
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:36.140
you know,
a bunch of kick ass guys that like you said,
I mean,

1172
01:09:36.141 --> 01:09:40.370
just incredible heroism across the board from your,
from your team,

1173
01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:46.340
you now and,
and by the way,
and actually,

1174
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:49.970
and Jacqueline,
I mentioned this in the speech as well.
Um,
there was some,

1175
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.640
there was some seals like you said that I guess it was the guys that were under

1176
01:09:52.641 --> 01:09:56.120
their guys from seal team three that came in.
And,
um,

1177
01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:00.020
I actually talked to one of those guys today because,
uh,
I knew,
you know,

1178
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.390
because you were coming on and I just a it was,
um,

1179
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:07.220
I talked to him was Dan Crenshaw and,
and I just told him,

1180
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.910
I said,
Hey,
I'm,
I'm talking to Derek today.
And he's like,
oh,
that's awesome.

1181
01:10:10.911 --> 01:10:15.590
And it was just cool.
It was just cool to hear the praise coming from Jacqueline.

1182
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.950
And that's exactly the same thing that the Dan Crenshaw said.
He's like,
yeah,

1183
01:10:18.951 --> 01:10:21.740
those guys were awesome.
I mean,
that's just,
that's as he,
you know,
I said,

1184
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.500
I know you were on that mission,
right?
And he goes,
he goes,
oh yeah.
He goes,

1185
01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:26.420
those guys were awesome.
That,
that's what he said.

1186
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.740
And it was cool to hear Jacqueline saying the same thing.
And you know,

1187
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:30.770
a lot of times people get,

1188
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:36.590
I guess people get caught up in whatever it is interservice rivalry.

1189
01:10:36.591 --> 01:10:39.430
And I actually literally have zero of that.
I,

1190
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.510
especially after my deployment to Ramadi,

1191
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:45.710
I have zero interservice rivalry of any kind.
Like,

1192
01:10:45.711 --> 01:10:49.340
if you're on the battlefield and you have an American flag on your uniform,

1193
01:10:49.341 --> 01:10:50.600
you are my brother.

1194
01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:55.770
And it was awesome to hear that feedback from both those guys.
Um,

1195
01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:58.323
<v 4>you,</v>

1196
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:02.610
<v 0>he wake up in the hospital and you're an affricate year and a hospital in</v>

1197
01:11:02.611 --> 01:11:03.440
Afghanistan.

1198
01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.010
<v 4>Yup.
Yeah.
I wake up in camp bastion,
uh,</v>

1199
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.350
doctors there and a,
he's like a captain.
Uh,

1200
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.590
you got shot and you may,
you know,
you're paralyzed and you may never walk again.

1201
01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.830
And I just kind of stare at them and say,
yeah,

1202
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:24.570
I know I'm Kinda had this awkward stare off.
And I'm like,
hey,

1203
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:30.270
it'd be telling my wife yet.
He's like,
no,
he's got stares at me.
I'm like,

1204
01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.940
go get me a goddamn phone.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Got It.
And so,

1205
01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:39.750
uh,
brings over the phone and I wake my wife up in the middle of the night,

1206
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:44.450
you know?
So you knew immediately I knew.
Yeah,
I knew that that was the case.
Uh,

1207
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.080
literally the second I got shot,
you know,

1208
01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:50.370
cause I tried to pick myself up and it's hard to understand if you,

1209
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.400
you who've never experienced it,
but you know,

1210
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:58.530
if just your body is numb and nothing works then you know,
you know,

1211
01:11:58.531 --> 01:12:02.880
and so like totally knew that that was the case and uh,

1212
01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.480
didn't know how long it would last,
but I knew that that was what the issue was.

1213
01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.280
And so,
um,
called my wife and woke her up,
told her,
you know,
hey,

1214
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.390
I've been shot paralyzing,
may never walk again and I'm coming home.

1215
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.880
And so that was pretty tough time and you know,

1216
01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.160
brief on tough phone call to make,
but through it all,

1217
01:12:23.161 --> 01:12:25.200
we're just really happy that I was able to make that phone call,
you know,

1218
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:27.210
cause a lot of guys don't get to do that.

1219
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.100
And so then moved on.
Um,

1220
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.890
getting back to Germany,
spent a couple of days there.
They didn't do anything,
uh,

1221
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:39.950
for my condition.
Just kind of waited,
transport back to Bethesda,
uh,

1222
01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:41.860
where I checked in and,
and,
uh,

1223
01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:45.510
met my wife and family and they started to do some other surgeries to remove the

1224
01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:48.690
bullet from my spine and some other,
uh,
other things.

1225
01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.700
And so our guys at that time too were they,
uh,

1226
01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:58.310
they stayed put in the compound and fought for the rest of the day.
Uh,
rebelled,

1227
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.660
a few different enemy assaults.
And then as you mentioned,

1228
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:05.190
the seal team that had come in to be the quick reactionary force for them,

1229
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:09.990
uh,
came in at night and Jacqueline did the turnover with them.

1230
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.050
They came in to kind of reinforce the area and do some,

1231
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.960
some battle damage assessment.
Uh,

1232
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:20.300
and then that's when Dan had gotten injured.
And so,
um,

1233
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.110
so the guys had gotten out and you know,

1234
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:24.870
the rest of our guys made it out of that day without,

1235
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.840
without any further injuries.
Uh,

1236
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:32.570
and so was in Bethesda and started my recovery process there with my wife by my

1237
01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:34.350
side.
And moving forward.

1238
01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:38.540
<v 0>And that recovery process is,
uh,</v>

1239
01:13:38.541 --> 01:13:41.540
I heard you saying one of your other videos that you have out there,

1240
01:13:41.541 --> 01:13:45.170
you're just talking about the new normal,
like,
okay,
this is the new normal.

1241
01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.330
This is what it is and I'm going forward.

1242
01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:52.460
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
And,
um,
the doctors were pretty noncommittal.</v>

1243
01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.360
So when I was there,
they didn't say,
you'll never walk again.

1244
01:13:57.361 --> 01:14:01.550
And they didn't say,
you know,
what are you can or can't do?
They said,
you know,

1245
01:14:01.551 --> 01:14:05.060
hey,
you have a spinal cord injury.
It's very severe.
It's very,
you know,

1246
01:14:05.061 --> 01:14:08.630
it's a big deal,
but if you recover function,
you know,

1247
01:14:08.631 --> 01:14:11.150
the research shows that it might happen in the first two years,
most likely.

1248
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.990
And so that was good.
Uh,

1249
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:18.810
in some ways and bad in other ways it was good because it left me,
uh,

1250
01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:22.060
the opportunity to change,
you know,
to,
to control my mindset in,
to say,
hey,
like,

1251
01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:25.660
so what?
I'm going to get up in in six weeks and go run a marathon or,

1252
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:29.710
or whatever.
Um,
the challenge with that though was that was a little bit,

1253
01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:32.710
that was good for me to get through those initial stages,

1254
01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:37.711
but it was also naive of me to not let the reality sink in.

1255
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.070
And so,
you know,

1256
01:14:39.071 --> 01:14:42.070
when that didn't happen in six weeks and I didn't walk and I wasn't gaining

1257
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:46.000
control or function of anything below my chest,
uh,

1258
01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.130
that's when it started to get real.
And like,

1259
01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:52.510
it was really challenging for me to deal with,
uh,
because I didn't,
you know,

1260
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:57.130
it was out of my control,
the level of,
you know,
the permanence of my injury.

1261
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:59.710
And then what,
what,
what,

1262
01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:04.540
was there anything that helped you get through that transition of when you,

1263
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:07.090
all of a sudden six weeks goes by and at you,
you,

1264
01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.570
the reality starts to hit you that made you say,
okay,

1265
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:15.280
here's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.
It was,
it was bad for about,

1266
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.600
I think,
probably first four to six months.
Um,

1267
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.380
and the reason why,
the reason why,
it's probably the lowest point actually,

1268
01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:26.500
definitely the lowest point was,
uh,

1269
01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:30.100
August 10th of 2012 so about two months after I got injured,

1270
01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.120
I had transferred to a Va facility in Tampa,
Florida.
Uh,

1271
01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.430
cause that was a major spinal cord injury clinic.

1272
01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:40.900
And so the military dod side doesn't have spinal cord injury recovery.

1273
01:15:40.901 --> 01:15:45.070
They have it all in the Va.
So it was just me and the VA with my wife.

1274
01:15:45.071 --> 01:15:47.920
We relocated there.
And on that day,
actually,

1275
01:15:47.921 --> 01:15:50.920
that was the day that uh,

1276
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:55.000
three other marines in our company from a different team were killed in an

1277
01:15:55.001 --> 01:15:59.290
insider attack in Sangin.
Uh,
and so Captain Matthew Manoukian,

1278
01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:01.420
Gunnery Sergeant Ryan,
Jesse and Staff Sergeant Scott Mode,

1279
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.940
we're all three guys that weren't in my team,

1280
01:16:03.941 --> 01:16:07.840
but there were friends of mine that were killed and we're coming home.

1281
01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.060
And so it was hard to deal with that.

1282
01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.640
It was hard cause I was still in the hospital,

1283
01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:13.870
I couldn't go to any of the funerals.

1284
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:18.310
And then it was continued to be hard after that because,
uh,

1285
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:23.490
it just reinforced the fact that my guys are out there vulnerable and I wasn't

1286
01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:27.490
there to lead them and that was my job and I felt like it was failing them every

1287
01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:28.540
day,
you know?

1288
01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.480
And so all of my wife was there with me throughout this recovery process as

1289
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.510
lonely,
you know,
everything you do in the militaries and teams,

1290
01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:37.000
you're always from day one boot camp,
you have a buddy for everything.

1291
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:41.410
And now this was the first time in the military when I'm,
I'm alone.
And uh,

1292
01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:45.880
you know,
without any control over the outcome of what would happen to my guys.

1293
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:50.650
And so
that was tough.
That was like definitely,

1294
01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.470
definitely the toughest part of the recovery process.

1295
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:58.471
And so luckily I was able to fly back to California and see them touch down in

1296
01:16:58.511 --> 01:17:01.390
December.
All the guys made it back safe and sound.

1297
01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:03.340
And then that was really what I was able to start to put the pieces back

1298
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:06.970
together and go forward and move on with my life.
What did that look like?

1299
01:17:06.971 --> 01:17:08.970
Picking up the pieces and putting them back together.

1300
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:10.040
And the reason I'm asking this

1301
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.960
<v 0>is just because,
you know,</v>

1302
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:16.760
I'm looking at where you're at right now and if there's any buddy that could be

1303
01:17:16.761 --> 01:17:18.410
listening that could say,
okay,

1304
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:23.150
let me hear what he did so I can emulate that.
Yeah.

1305
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:25.003
The,

1306
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.670
<v 4>uh,
the key things.
There's,</v>

1307
01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.910
there's a couple things that I did that I think are,
um,

1308
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:32.600
very similar to some of the stuff that you've,

1309
01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:36.230
you've talked about before and one is mission and purpose.

1310
01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:38.720
And so recovering in the hospital,

1311
01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:42.560
sitting there by herself wasn't the mission that,
that I signed up for.

1312
01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:46.160
And so as soon as I possibly could,
I was back at work.

1313
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:49.340
And so I was back in the ops section in January,
you know,

1314
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:52.820
as a future operations officer trying to do powerpoints and slides and all the

1315
01:17:52.821 --> 01:17:57.440
other stuff that,
you know,
that officers are our tasks to do.

1316
01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:00.590
And it was great cause nobody else wanted to do that,
that stuff.

1317
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:03.790
So I was happy to take it on and do it.
Um,

1318
01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:08.540
and so being around the team,
providing something meaningful for them and,

1319
01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:13.310
uh,
having an impact was more important for my psyche than anything else.

1320
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:18.140
Um,
other two things I've kind of looked at were like very stoic philosophy,

1321
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.860
stoic mindset,
and realizing that,
you know,

1322
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:23.840
somethings are out of my control,

1323
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.400
but I do have control over the way I choose to react to things,

1324
01:18:28.401 --> 01:18:30.860
the way I choose to move forward with my life and that I have opportunities,

1325
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:34.670
opportunities that guys like Matt Ryan and sky don't have.

1326
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.110
And so for me to squander that,

1327
01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:39.890
for me not to take advantage of every day and move forward in a way that they

1328
01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:42.230
would be proud of is a complete waste.

1329
01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:47.260
And so that makes it really easy to stop feeling sorry for yourself and to keep

1330
01:18:47.691 --> 01:18:49.400
pushing and to keep doing whatever you want to do.

1331
01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.700
And so those were the two things.
I think that every day,
even to this day,

1332
01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:56.150
continue to push me forward is like,
you know,
uh,

1333
01:18:57.170 --> 01:19:00.470
setting out on the mission and the vision that I want to achieve and the purpose

1334
01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.910
for my life and taken advantage of every day because,
you know,

1335
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:08.510
it's an opportunity.
I have something that,
that every day I wake up,

1336
01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:10.100
I can go and create or do or,

1337
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.160
or build or make something meaningful and to not take advantage of that as is

1338
01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:19.130
to,
to squander an opportunity that,
that anyone of those guys would love to have.

1339
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:21.590
So it makes it real simple and easy for me to do.

1340
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:25.470
<v 0>Oh man,
brother.
Um,</v>

1341
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:30.140
yeah.
That's awesome man.
That's,
that's awesome.

1342
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:34.970
As an awesome attitude.
How long did you stay,

1343
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:37.670
how long did you keep working in,
in the Marine Corp for

1344
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:43.480
<v 4>sit for about another two years after that.
So Marine Corps is pretty cool.</v>

1345
01:19:43.481 --> 01:19:47.710
They have some programs in place for guys who were injured in the line of duty

1346
01:19:47.711 --> 01:19:50.470
where you can stay in essentially as long as you want,

1347
01:19:50.471 --> 01:19:54.100
as long as you keep getting promoted and keep contributing.
And so for me,

1348
01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:58.710
I didn't pursue those longer term programs,
um,

1349
01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:01.570
because I started to find some other opportunities that was,

1350
01:20:01.571 --> 01:20:05.110
was as passionate about and wanted to pursue outside the military.

1351
01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:08.890
And so I continued to work for about two as a staff officer,
um,

1352
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:10.710
working with first,
you know,

1353
01:20:10.711 --> 01:20:15.150
the operations section as we were transitioning and trying to assign to mission

1354
01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:18.700
sets and supporting all those different types of operation,
uh,

1355
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.960
operational planning efforts.
And,
uh,

1356
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:26.940
I'd gone back to business school part time to try to learn about business and to

1357
01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:29.520
go get more education.
Um,

1358
01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:34.140
and then I became really passionate about a new opportunity and medical

1359
01:20:34.141 --> 01:20:39.141
technology and medical research and thought that that was where my next big

1360
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:40.733
impact would be.

1361
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:46.070
And so decided to officially retire from the military in November of 2014 and

1362
01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:53.460
have been out since then.
And what was the,
uh,
what was the new opportunity and,

1363
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.410
and where did that lead?

1364
01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:00.860
So the opportunity that arose was to start a company and try to address issues

1365
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:04.680
and unmet needs,
socio spinal cord injury.

1366
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:09.950
And so I learned firsthand how many challenges and how many issues there are in

1367
01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:13.590
addition to just being in a wheelchair that a lot of people don't see.

1368
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:18.600
And so everything from bowels,
bladder management,

1369
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:22.890
sexual function,
physical training,
osteopenic,
bone density and muscle mass,

1370
01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:27.891
there's so many different things that are challenges that are unmet needs of the

1371
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.050
people like me and the patient population of which I'm a part of.

1372
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:35.730
And so the idea and the company that we started is called spinal singularity,

1373
01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:38.340
and that's what we're working to solve.
And so our first product,

1374
01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:40.790
the first thing we're working on,
which is in clinical studies now,
is a,

1375
01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:43.590
a smart catheter for bladder management.

1376
01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:46.960
And so it allows people to push a button and empty their bladder,
uh,

1377
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.500
which is currently,
you know,

1378
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.760
much more advanced and much more useful and functional than the current method

1379
01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:54.470
of management.

1380
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:58.170
And so that's what we've been working on for the past past few years.

1381
01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.150
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
it's,
um,</v>

1382
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.310
as I was kind of reading about the stuff that you've been working on,
and,

1383
01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:06.450
and even on that,
uh,
item right there,

1384
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.940
he reminded me of when,
uh,

1385
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:13.110
when my buddy Jody Mitic came down to be on the podcast and he's,
you know,

1386
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:16.320
he's a double amputee and,
but,
you know,

1387
01:22:16.321 --> 01:22:18.720
I would see pictures of him walking around and he would do,
like,

1388
01:22:18.721 --> 01:22:21.870
he did some big race up in Canada.
I forget what the race was called,

1389
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:23.670
the amazing race.

1390
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:28.380
And he would do all this like really badass stuff that I would think,
hey,

1391
01:22:28.381 --> 01:22:32.470
you know,
it's,
it's all good.
And,
and um,

1392
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:34.890
when he came down here,
um,

1393
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:37.890
I think it might've been the second time he came down here.

1394
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.370
So there was a second time he came down here and we like hung out more because,

1395
01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:42.061
you know,

1396
01:22:42.061 --> 01:22:45.630
he came down for a little bit more time and we were a little bit tighter.
But,
um,

1397
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:51.420
he,
well first of all,
I got him a hotel room and he called me and he said,

1398
01:22:51.421 --> 01:22:53.430
hey,
I'm not going to stay at that hotel because a,

1399
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:57.570
they don't have a handicap stuff there.
And I was like,
kind of,
I was like,
okay,

1400
01:22:57.571 --> 01:23:00.660
yeah man,
cool.
You know,
whatever.
But in my mind,

1401
01:23:00.661 --> 01:23:04.150
I was kinda thinking to myself like,
why,
why does he need that?

1402
01:23:04.151 --> 01:23:07.690
Because I see him walking around and he's running the damn amazing race.
Right.

1403
01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.050
And then,
so I asked him,
I was like,
Whoa,
you know,

1404
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:12.800
like later I didn't ask them on the phone.
I said,
yeah,

1405
01:23:12.801 --> 01:23:16.490
the cool whatever you want.
And then later I talked to him,
I was like,
why do you,

1406
01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:20.870
why do you need that?
I wasn't trying to be a jerk,
I was just honestly asking.

1407
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:24.310
And he was like,
yeah,
well,
you know,
like at night,
I mean,
I,

1408
01:23:24.330 --> 01:23:28.300
I take my legs off and I got to crawl around and if I got to pull myself up on

1409
01:23:28.301 --> 01:23:30.520
the toilet,
I got to pull myself in the shower and like,

1410
01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:33.250
if there's not handles and stuff,
uh,
you know,
it sucks.

1411
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.570
And so that was like part one of this story.

1412
01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:42.290
Part two was we,
he wanted to walk around San Diego,
um,
you know,

1413
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:44.920
see what I lived and go to the ocean and all this kind of stuff.

1414
01:23:44.921 --> 01:23:49.921
And so we did that and we had gone to the mid way aircraft carrier and walked

1415
01:23:51.611 --> 01:23:54.160
around there and then we walked downtown and we walked.
We were,

1416
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:57.820
then we went to where I live and we were kind of like walking in the beach area

1417
01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.670
and I could see he was kind of like slowing down.

1418
01:24:00.671 --> 01:24:04.130
I could see his face getting a little bit,
you know,
like,
like a little bit of a,

1419
01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:07.240
a little bit of strain in his face.
And he's like,
Hey man,

1420
01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:10.730
let me sit down for a minute.
And then he,
he'd sit down and we talk a little bit,

1421
01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.780
then he'd say,
okay,
let's go.
And then he'd say,
look,
lay,

1422
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:16.930
let's sit down and findings that came in.
Can we just go back to your house?
Like,

1423
01:24:16.931 --> 01:24:20.500
my legs are really hurting.
And you know,
like,
yeah,
guess what?
You're,

1424
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.240
you're putting all that pressure on,
on their stumps and,

1425
01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.820
and it wears away the skin and it's,
it's,

1426
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:32.680
you know,
it's hard and it sucks.
And um,
I guess,

1427
01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:33.850
so that's part number two.

1428
01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:38.590
And what these two things reinforced to me is,

1429
01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.850
you know what,
like,

1430
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:44.690
there's so much going on that week that I don't see that that did,

1431
01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.310
cause,
you know,
I hadn't been injured like that.
There's so many things going on.

1432
01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:51.820
They don't like all,
you know,
he's doing okay.
It's like,
yeah,
he's doing okay.

1433
01:24:51.821 --> 01:24:54.070
You're seeing him for like two hours,
three hours.

1434
01:24:54.190 --> 01:24:55.900
He's living like that 24 hours a day.

1435
01:24:55.901 --> 01:24:59.500
And he's got all these things to contend with that haven't even remotely crossed

1436
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:03.310
my mind.
And so when I,
when I saw the,
yeah,

1437
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:08.230
I mean straight up the first time I ever it ever entered my mind,

1438
01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.760
how you take a Piss,

1439
01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.440
how you would take a piss and the first time it ever entered my mind when I was

1440
01:25:14.441 --> 01:25:18.340
researching what your medical devices are.
And I was like,
you know,
how,

1441
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:23.470
how ignorant m I,
you know,
to be sitting here in net,
never even thought of that.

1442
01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:28.560
And then that's one of all these other problems that you have to contend with on

1443
01:25:28.721 --> 01:25:33.020
a daily basis.
And it's,
uh,
you know,
it's a daily,
it's a daily struggle.

1444
01:25:33.021 --> 01:25:36.780
And you know,
something,
something Jim Webb brought up as well.
Um,
he,

1445
01:25:36.781 --> 01:25:40.390
he was talking about different types of courage and he brought up something

1446
01:25:40.391 --> 01:25:43.960
called daily courage and he's talked about one of his friends that was wounded

1447
01:25:43.961 --> 01:25:47.170
and he's like,
every day it takes him 20 minutes to get out of bed.

1448
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:50.830
It takes him 15 minutes to get here and you know,
to the other side of his room,

1449
01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.240
he's like,
that's daily courage that he has to show.
And I'm thinking to myself,

1450
01:25:55.241 --> 01:26:00.220
Yelp,
and you know,
it just makes me feel like there's so much,

1451
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:02.500
there's so much more that you know,

1452
01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:07.190
you through on a daily basis that we and me,

1453
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:10.580
I completely take for granted a completely take it for granted.

1454
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.540
And so for me to sit here and talk to you and,

1455
01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:17.570
and realize we know how hard it is for you on a daily basis,

1456
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:20.330
the things you have to go through and then to hear you say like,
yeah,

1457
01:26:20.331 --> 01:26:24.770
but I'm glad I'm here on like my brothers who didn't come home.

1458
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.940
Yeah.
I don't think anyone has any excuses,
really none.
So,
um,

1459
01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:35.230
<v 3>yeah,
totally agree.
And uh,</v>

1460
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:41.680
just makes you that much more
creative with your mindset,
right?

1461
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:46.480
Like you look at all the challenges but also look at the opportunities,
right?

1462
01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:50.700
So I can sprint through airports much faster than you can with that.

1463
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:54.630
I can't even stress,
I got good parking most of the time,
you know,

1464
01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:57.010
so he's got to make up time where you can write.

1465
01:26:57.011 --> 01:26:59.650
It takes me a little bit longer to get off the airplane but kill you on the

1466
01:26:59.651 --> 01:27:04.390
straightaways any day.
And so,
uh,
you know,

1467
01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.520
you just got to take,
take the go to the bed,
but you know,
it's,

1468
01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:11.460
it's not a choice.
So that was the,

1469
01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:13.810
that was the,

1470
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:16.000
<v 0>you got your MBA</v>

1471
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:18.700
<v 3>add as is that while you were still in,</v>

1472
01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:22.450
you went and got your Mba or did you get out?
I got out about halfway through,

1473
01:27:22.451 --> 01:27:26.200
so I did a part time program at Ucla.
It's an executive Mba,

1474
01:27:26.201 --> 01:27:28.600
so it's on the weekends every other weekend.

1475
01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.050
And so as I was leaving the military,

1476
01:27:32.051 --> 01:27:35.140
so I did the first year I was still a full on active duty and then retired

1477
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:39.670
shortly at in the second year,
uh,
took another job at another medical device,

1478
01:27:39.690 --> 01:27:42.010
start up to get some experience.
And then as soon as I graduated,

1479
01:27:42.011 --> 01:27:46.150
started full time,
uh,
working on spinal singularity in my company.
And so,

1480
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:50.620
um,
one of the experiences too that was really cool that,
uh,

1481
01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.710
I had as part of their retirement,
I think about it now,
was,
uh,

1482
01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.990
being able to use and be involved in as a user exoskeleton technology.

1483
01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:03.280
And so there's robotic exoskeleton technology that allows parallel paraplegics

1484
01:28:03.281 --> 01:28:05.650
to stand and walk.
So,
um,

1485
01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:10.770
because of a lot of generous donors and the Brain Raider Foundation,
uh,

1486
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:14.030
I was able to be,
to use that device into,

1487
01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:18.550
to obtain that device even before FDA approval.
And so I had a really,

1488
01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:22.510
really a great set up within our,

1489
01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.460
our battalion headquarters and our office.

1490
01:28:24.461 --> 01:28:27.910
And so we had a physical therapist downstairs.
My office was upstairs.

1491
01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:32.230
I was fully accessible,
which is not like most buildings in the military.
Um,

1492
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:36.220
and so I was able to use this device to stand and walk and to do therapy.
And,
uh,

1493
01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.580
when I retired I was able to use that device and not use my wheelchair to all to

1494
01:28:39.581 --> 01:28:43.090
leave on my own two feet,
which was a goal that I'd set for myself.

1495
01:28:43.091 --> 01:28:47.180
And so that was great.
Um,

1496
01:28:47.290 --> 01:28:49.960
but it still didn't address a lot of these other unmet needs that we had for the

1497
01:28:49.961 --> 01:28:50.380
community.

1498
01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:55.360
And so that was what inspired me to try to move forward on my own path and start

1499
01:28:55.361 --> 01:29:00.220
my own company and build this product to,
to solve these issues.
So,
um,
so yeah,

1500
01:29:00.230 --> 01:29:02.670
so very thankful for all the donors and the,
the,

1501
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.750
the foundation to help support that.
Um,
and I was also very fortunate,

1502
01:29:06.751 --> 01:29:10.800
so like you said,
a lot of other people had gone before me.

1503
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:15.420
And so one of my classmates at the Naval Academy,
a guy named Matt Lampert,
uh,

1504
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:18.960
got to First Marine Raider Battalion about two years before I did because he was

1505
01:29:18.961 --> 01:29:22.680
on the quick cycle of deployments.
And in 2010,

1506
01:29:22.681 --> 01:29:27.681
he was a bilateral amputee above the knee as I was going through the training

1507
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:30.630
pipeline.
And so I went up and saw him in,

1508
01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:35.040
in a Bethesda hospital and just checked in with them real briefly as a,

1509
01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:38.640
as he was coming back and I'm starting his rehab.
And you know,

1510
01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:42.090
this is maybe a week after he'd gotten off the battlefield or less.
And he says,

1511
01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:45.150
you know,
like,
so what are you going to do?
And he's like,
I'm gonna go back,

1512
01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.870
like go back to California.
He's like,
no,
I'm going back to Afghanistan.
Like,
okay,

1513
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.680
Gotcha.
And I'm thinking like,
man,
Dallas,
how's he going to do that?

1514
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:55.710
And sure enough,
as I graduated from training,

1515
01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.930
he was my company executive officer.

1516
01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.960
They checked me in and then we deployed again.

1517
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:05.540
So when I had gotten injured and deployed,
he was there as their company X.
So,
um,

1518
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:07.500
and then after my friend Matt had gotten killed,

1519
01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:10.740
he went down and took over his team as a bilateral amputee above the knees.

1520
01:30:10.741 --> 01:30:15.390
And so,
you know,
he had come back,
he had done that.
He had tried that path.

1521
01:30:15.391 --> 01:30:19.620
And so for me,
you know,
going back and recovering,
uh,
our building was accessible,

1522
01:30:19.621 --> 01:30:22.170
you know,
it's wheelchair accessible.
There was a lot of other things.

1523
01:30:22.171 --> 01:30:25.260
And then just that example that he said as well was,
uh,

1524
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:29.640
was really helpful and inspiring for me to follow.
And so,
um,

1525
01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.930
so yeah,
so really,
really fortunate in the Rehab Environment,

1526
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:37.290
especially because of all the assets that SOCOM has.

1527
01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:39.900
And so if I had been in the ground's been a totally,

1528
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:43.940
totally different story for how the recovery would have gone.
Um,
you know,

1529
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:46.000
my entire command was super supportive of,

1530
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:49.080
of me coming back and working and doing,
I said,
whatever you need,

1531
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:53.310
whatever you want,
you want to go to ops,
like,
sure,
let's do it giddy up.
And so,

1532
01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:56.940
uh,
yeah.
So it was a good place to recover.

1533
01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.600
<v 0>When you hear about like when you say broadly,
like if I was a grunt,</v>

1534
01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:05.170
I would've gotten that kind of support.
I mean,
I get that because,
you know,

1535
01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.850
in the seal teams we have the same thing.
Like,

1536
01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.110
like people will rally around and make stuff happen.
Um,

1537
01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.570
is there any organizations that you know of that sort of support,
like the,

1538
01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:21.550
the front line soldier marine that gets,
that gets a catastrophic?

1539
01:31:21.551 --> 01:31:22.384
We wounded?

1540
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:26.300
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
there's a lot of different nonprofits out there.</v>

1541
01:31:26.301 --> 01:31:28.700
Semper fi fund is a big one.
Um,

1542
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:31.820
there's a lot of different groups of support them and,
and,
and it's different.

1543
01:31:31.821 --> 01:31:34.020
It's not that they don't have the assets,
um,

1544
01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.170
it's just the location of those assets.

1545
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:41.410
And so an infantry battalion has a very different operational mission and leeway

1546
01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:44.270
than a special operations battalion.
Um,

1547
01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:48.350
and so for all of the guys that were injured in the conventional forces,

1548
01:31:48.351 --> 01:31:48.981
when they come back,

1549
01:31:48.981 --> 01:31:52.430
they're immediately sent to wounded warrior battalion at the hospital.

1550
01:31:53.150 --> 01:31:55.880
And so their job is now show up to your appointments,

1551
01:31:55.881 --> 01:31:59.440
into your rehab until you get separated from the military.
Yeah.
Um,

1552
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.060
<v 2>that's a very different way to recover with a bunch of other people who are</v>

1553
01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:07.510
injured or on their way out or whatever else versus,
you know,
and,

1554
01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:11.800
and without an operational purpose,
then what I was able to do,

1555
01:32:11.801 --> 01:32:15.490
and I was very fortunate to do where I went back to an operational goal with an

1556
01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:19.240
Italian and I was the only one of the only injured guys,
you know,

1557
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:23.090
recovering around normal people because I wanted to be like that.
Yeah.

1558
01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.510
I don't know if you ever know a guy named Jake Schick,

1559
01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:28.870
but he was on here and he told his story and that's like,
that's what it was.

1560
01:32:28.871 --> 01:32:32.980
He was there.
He was like,
his job was just to kind of recover,

1561
01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:35.920
but you could see and talking to him,
he,

1562
01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:41.220
he would have loved to have had some kind of a higher purpose than just that,

1563
01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:43.780
which eventually he made.
He made it for himself.

1564
01:32:43.781 --> 01:32:48.280
He made his own organization to help wounded vets and,

1565
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:53.440
and,
uh,
help suicide prevention with 22 kill.
Um,
but yeah,

1566
01:32:53.441 --> 01:32:56.770
so I think that that's a,
that's a good comparison,
you know,

1567
01:32:56.771 --> 01:33:00.200
just from hearing him tell his story about,
you know,

1568
01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.400
what his recovery was.
I can,
it was,
it was geared towards,
okay,

1569
01:33:03.401 --> 01:33:06.730
you're going to do this until you get out of the Marine Corps.
I guarantee,

1570
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:07.180
you know,

1571
01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:10.270
you've talked to Jake Schick for three minutes and you're gonna realize if,

1572
01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:13.330
if you could have told him,
hey,
we want you to do this for the Marine Corps,

1573
01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:16.570
he would have been all over it.
He would have gone and done anything.
You know,

1574
01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:21.550
cause he's a bad ass.
Uh,
but,
but yeah,
no,
that's a,
that's a good point.
And that's,

1575
01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:26.590
well you've heard me say it cause you kind of referenced it a little bit.

1576
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:28.360
You know,
I always tell guys that need to find a new mission,

1577
01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.630
whatever that new mission is,
you got to find a new mission.

1578
01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:34.180
You can't be sitting around with no mission man.
You've had a mission for,
for,

1579
01:33:34.181 --> 01:33:38.770
for whatever,
eight years,
seven years,
20 years,
however long it's been.
You had,

1580
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:43.190
you had a mission,
you had a goal and if that goes away,
you,

1581
01:33:43.191 --> 01:33:46.360
you got to find a new one.
And it doesn't really matter what it is.

1582
01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:49.370
I mean pick something good.
Right?
I mean your mission shouldn't be,

1583
01:33:49.371 --> 01:33:53.970
it shouldn't involve whiskey,
but pick something positive and something good.

1584
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:55.920
Move in the right direction.
How is,

1585
01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:59.860
how is s a spinal singularity doing right now?
Like what's the,

1586
01:33:59.890 --> 01:34:04.720
what's the status we're doing really well?
So,
uh,
it's been a good three years.

1587
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:08.560
Um,
I learned a ton and just the fact that we're still in business today is,

1588
01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.950
it was pretty amazing because I had zero experience,
right?

1589
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:13.570
I had no clue what I was doing cause I,

1590
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:16.750
no experience in the medical device industry had no network.
Um,

1591
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:20.880
and so the first year it was a lot of,
lot of faith,
a lot of ups and downs,
right.

1592
01:34:20.881 --> 01:34:22.570
And,
uh,
just like starting any business,

1593
01:34:22.571 --> 01:34:24.850
but especially in the medical device industry,
uh,

1594
01:34:24.851 --> 01:34:29.730
I learned a ton and then was fortunate enough to find people to bring in that

1595
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:34.330
are experienced and then a trust.
And so,
um,
we've raised money from investors.

1596
01:34:34.331 --> 01:34:39.200
We've raised money from grants and non dilutive sources.
Um,

1597
01:34:39.210 --> 01:34:43.060
and we're retina and we have a small team of six employees in,
in San Clemente.

1598
01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:47.200
And,
uh,
we're running a large clinical study across the u s right now.

1599
01:34:47.230 --> 01:34:51.280
And so we have sites all over everywhere from Minnesota,

1600
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:53.420
New Jersey to,
you know,
uh,

1601
01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:58.130
all over in California and Arizona were,
those

1602
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:01.160
<v 3>sites are actively enrolling people interested in,
in supporting our trial.</v>

1603
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.880
And so how long has that trial need to last before it gets approval?
Uh,

1604
01:35:04.881 --> 01:35:06.870
so the goal is to have approval,
um,

1605
01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:10.650
internationally next year and then hopefully by the end of the year,
uh,

1606
01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.270
we can have FDA approval for the product as well.
Uh,

1607
01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.220
we're in 100% certain that does happen,
but that's uh,

1608
01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:18.840
that's the goal and hopefully we can collect the data we need as quickly as

1609
01:35:18.841 --> 01:35:20.220
possible to,
to accomplish that.

1610
01:35:20.610 --> 01:35:24.270
And then do you have your next device in mind after this one?
One goes live.

1611
01:35:24.490 --> 01:35:28.260
Got Ideas.
Regret.
Yeah.
But,
uh,
I'm always,

1612
01:35:28.261 --> 01:35:32.280
I've always been like a versatile guy,
not like the execution,

1613
01:35:32.281 --> 01:35:34.800
like the a hundred percent of the zero to 90% guy,

1614
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:36.870
not the 90 to 100% and bring it home.
Got It.

1615
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.690
And so I know that's how everybody else that we were,
you know,

1616
01:35:39.691 --> 01:35:44.610
everybody else in our team now or like the 90 to 100% guys.
And so,
um,

1617
01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.890
I'm trying to be more like that,
but not even think about it.
Cause if,

1618
01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:49.350
if this doesn't work,
got it.
You know,
there is no business,
right?
Like,

1619
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:54.060
we've put all of our,
you know,
this is what we raise money to do.
You know,

1620
01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:55.020
we haven't,
we don't,

1621
01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:59.340
we can't knowingly devote a minute of time to anything else until this is

1622
01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.560
successful.
So you'll get hit with that,

1623
01:36:01.561 --> 01:36:03.570
then we can kind of go back to the drawing board.
Thanks sense.
But,

1624
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:06.720
and once it's approved here,
then it just,
then it's just a sailing it,

1625
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:11.670
selling it and getting it out there and it's going into the,
into the world.

1626
01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:15.180
And then what about the,
uh,
what about the Marine Raider Foundation,

1627
01:36:15.181 --> 01:36:19.890
which is another thing you were involved with?
Yeah.
So,
um,
after I was injured,

1628
01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:21.203
I was very ignorant.

1629
01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:26.220
The realities of the way things work and what the needs would be a for me.

1630
01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:28.140
And so,
um,

1631
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:31.800
a lot of nonprofits out there do all kinds of great work and different things.

1632
01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:36.750
As a Marine Raider,
uh,
in this situation,
without knowing anything,
you know,

1633
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.840
I didn't want to talk to anybody that I was very hesitant to reach out for help

1634
01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:45.120
to anybody.
Um,
and so as these things arose,
you know,

1635
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:50.430
one of the guys who is,
or was,
is it employee of the organization now and then,

1636
01:36:50.431 --> 01:36:52.800
so it wasn't currently an active duty rate or at that time it was like,
hey man,

1637
01:36:52.801 --> 01:36:56.460
like we're starting this nonprofit to help guys.
Like if you need anything,

1638
01:36:56.461 --> 01:37:00.050
just say,
say so.
And so I was like,
all right,
cool.
Um,

1639
01:37:00.210 --> 01:37:04.470
and so they helped pay for my wife to move out to Tampa so she can be there for

1640
01:37:04.471 --> 01:37:06.870
my recovery,
helped,
uh,
you know,

1641
01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:11.010
get her car out there so she could drive around and help transport me around to

1642
01:37:11.011 --> 01:37:12.780
different things.
Um,

1643
01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.560
they helped us raise money for the exoskeleton cause it was still not covered by

1644
01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:20.500
insurance or the Va.
It was still experimental at that time.
Um,

1645
01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.100
and helps do all of these things.
And so,
you know,

1646
01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:26.160
my wife and I are eternally grateful for all the support we received from them.

1647
01:37:26.730 --> 01:37:31.470
And so as soon as I got out of the military,
uh,
that organization said,
Hey,

1648
01:37:31.471 --> 01:37:34.530
do you want to be a board member?
Do you want to help?
And I'm like,
yes,

1649
01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:35.370
absolutely.

1650
01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:40.050
And so that was 2014 and so I've been on the board since then and I think it was

1651
01:37:40.051 --> 01:37:42.090
2015 I took over as the board president.

1652
01:37:42.091 --> 01:37:46.170
And so I've been trying to devote my spare time to help that organization,

1653
01:37:46.171 --> 01:37:49.740
but the missions that we serve and ultimately,
uh,

1654
01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:54.770
what we do at the foundation is just to support unmet needs of the community and

1655
01:37:55.081 --> 01:37:55.914
their families.

1656
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.980
And so the government's really good at supporting injured veterans and,

1657
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:05.540
and they have so many different programs that,
that help people.
But,
uh,

1658
01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.330
every situation is unique.
And so,
um,

1659
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.270
Congress isn't going to change a law to appropriate money for you to not do

1660
01:38:12.271 --> 01:38:14.940
something that doesn't fall into the black and white letter of the law.

1661
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.340
And that's fine.
Um,

1662
01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:20.940
but that's where we step in and are able to help things to help people and,
uh,

1663
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:23.260
you know,
take the stress off of them in their times of need.

1664
01:38:23.261 --> 01:38:27.790
So at four real major areas,
one is support to the,
the marine Raiders,
uh,

1665
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:29.160
and others,
family resiliency.

1666
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:32.040
Third one is tragedy assistance and survivor support.

1667
01:38:32.041 --> 01:38:37.020
And then the last one is a raider legacy and preservation.
And so,
um,

1668
01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:41.580
obviously the raider support and the family support are pretty broad,
uh,

1669
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:44.610
ways to work.
And they can be anything from,
you know,

1670
01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:49.340
just anything under the sun that,
that will help marines and their families.
Um,

1671
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:53.070
tragedy assistance or survivor support,
even though,
uh,
you know,

1672
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.840
we're engaged in varying levels of combat.

1673
01:38:54.841 --> 01:38:58.230
There's still guys out there putting their lives on the line every day.

1674
01:38:58.470 --> 01:39:03.390
And that's evidenced by a recent training incident that we had about two years

1675
01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:06.180
ago.
Less than two years ago in 2017,

1676
01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:11.790
there was a c one 30 crash that claimed the lives of seven marine Raiders.

1677
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:15.780
Um,
and then two years before that helicopter crash in,
uh,

1678
01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:19.720
another training mission out off the coast of Florida that took another lodge

1679
01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:24.450
and other seven guys.
And so,
um,
being able to support their,
their,

1680
01:39:24.610 --> 01:39:29.590
uh,
families and family members that had,
had survived those incidences is a,

1681
01:39:29.591 --> 01:39:31.890
a big part of the mission that we,
we fulfill.

1682
01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:35.700
And then read her legacy in preservation just

1683
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.010
<v 0>cause they want one thing.
When you hit on this a little bit,</v>

1684
01:39:39.011 --> 01:39:42.400
but I'm just going to expand a little bit so people can kind of understand when

1685
01:39:42.401 --> 01:39:46.570
you talked about like congress isn't going to change a law to give a family that

1686
01:39:46.571 --> 01:39:49.150
what they needed a certain time cause it's too specific or whatever.

1687
01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:54.220
And the reality is,
let let's say a kid,
you know,

1688
01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:57.440
needs a new bicycle and there's,
there's,
you know,

1689
01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:01.180
the dad can't go and get it because he's wounded,
he's in the hospital.

1690
01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:04.870
Like that's the kind of things that the foundation could do.
Go Out,
buy the bike,

1691
01:40:04.871 --> 01:40:07.510
get it built and deliver.
You know,
like little things like that,

1692
01:40:07.511 --> 01:40:10.570
that really matter.
Um,
and it can be bigger things too.
Like you said,

1693
01:40:10.571 --> 01:40:13.390
like moving a family,
helping to pay for the movement of a family,

1694
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:16.840
helping had read deck,
get furniture for the new apartment,
whatever it is.

1695
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:20.140
There's no law that takes care of those situations.

1696
01:40:20.141 --> 01:40:25.110
But these types of organizations do that and it,
and it does have a big deal,
uh,

1697
01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:29.350
has a huge impact for those,
for those families that are there.
And believe me,

1698
01:40:29.351 --> 01:40:31.330
when those families are going the most tough situations,

1699
01:40:32.290 --> 01:40:37.290
these little things to be able to not have them think about it,

1700
01:40:37.451 --> 01:40:41.470
not have them think about,
hey,
the,
the cost of a flight to fly,
you know,

1701
01:40:41.471 --> 01:40:45.460
dad out to come and visit his song or whatever.
Any,
any of those little things,

1702
01:40:45.461 --> 01:40:46.720
they don't seem like a big deal.

1703
01:40:46.721 --> 01:40:50.680
But there are a huge deal when families are going through these traumatic times.

1704
01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:54.040
Yeah.
So another example,
uh,
when

1705
01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:58.990
<v 4>my friend Matt was killed and his family went to go pick him up at Dover,
uh,</v>

1706
01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:01.230
one of the last,
you know,

1707
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.080
things that his mother wanted was her whole family to fly home with them.

1708
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:10.600
And the government only pay for the father and mother,
I think it was.
And so,
uh,

1709
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:13.360
the other two brothers and some other family friends,

1710
01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.720
they wanted to all be on the same flight.

1711
01:41:14.721 --> 01:41:17.920
And it was one thing that she wanted you to know and she didn't want anything

1712
01:41:17.921 --> 01:41:21.690
else.
Just said,
hey,
I want us all to be on the same plane going home while we're,

1713
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:24.700
we're grieving with my son.
Yeah,
no,
that's,

1714
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:28.620
so instead of having to deal with that and the insanity of it to you,

1715
01:41:28.621 --> 01:41:31.060
I'll just tell her,
hey,
we got your life where you're like,
you're on the plane.

1716
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:34.330
You're good.
Perfect example.
Such a small,

1717
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:36.280
seemingly small gesture,

1718
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:41.281
but with a timely injection of support can have a really lifelong impact on,

1719
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:45.010
on people.
And so,
um,
those are some of the,

1720
01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:48.100
the different experiences and I can go on and on about different ways that we've

1721
01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:48.761
been able to help people.

1722
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:53.170
But bottom line is guys are going out and doing these different things and for

1723
01:41:53.171 --> 01:41:57.280
them to be able to go forward and,
and to,
to fight with a happy heart,
uh,

1724
01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.710
they want to know their families are taken care of on the back side and the

1725
01:41:59.711 --> 01:42:03.590
community will support them.
And so that's,
that's letter.
It is.
We just,
you know,

1726
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.451
we're five,

1727
01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:07.780
one c three that raises money to support the community members in their time of

1728
01:42:07.781 --> 01:42:11.980
need.
And then the last one is legacy.
Yeah.
So,

1729
01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:14.320
which is legit because you guys,

1730
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:19.270
I mean you guys kind of are saving the legacy of the original World War II

1731
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:22.480
Raiders,
right?
Yes.
We're trying to,
and so,
um,

1732
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:27.150
can you explain how that,
how you guys adopted the name?
Cause it's been nice.

1733
01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:32.020
It's awesome.
It's a good history.
So,
uh,
so the marine Raiders,

1734
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.620
the World War II marine Raiders were one of the first special operations units

1735
01:42:35.621 --> 01:42:40.330
formed a period and they were formed in World War II and their mission was to

1736
01:42:40.331 --> 01:42:43.730
conduct enemy,
uh,
deeper connoisseur.
It's essentially,
um,

1737
01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.880
prior to invasions in the Pacific.

1738
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:48.940
And so these guys would mount up and rubber boats.

1739
01:42:48.941 --> 01:42:52.390
They were the first ones to do submarine lockouts and uh,
you know,

1740
01:42:52.391 --> 01:42:56.680
and some of the things that they did were just insane even by today's standards.

1741
01:42:57.050 --> 01:43:00.730
Um,
and so these guys were very well trained,
uh,

1742
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:06.130
and basically provided the lineage of,
of who we are,
who we are today.

1743
01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:10.170
And so those,
that group and then,
uh,

1744
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:13.270
other members also joined the Oss,
uh,
at that time,

1745
01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:16.270
which was the precursor to the CIA.
Uh,
there was a lot of marines at that,

1746
01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:19.380
that unit as well.
And those are the two kind of,
uh,

1747
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:21.520
units that we draw our lineage from as,

1748
01:43:21.521 --> 01:43:23.500
as the marine special operations units today.

1749
01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:28.510
And so these guys were disbanded in 1946 after they came back,

1750
01:43:28.511 --> 01:43:32.560
or maybe it was even 1945 after the war.
Um,
and so,

1751
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:38.260
uh,
we've been very active in connecting with these guys.

1752
01:43:38.261 --> 01:43:41.820
They have an association,
uh,
that actually Colonel Kaczynski is,

1753
01:43:41.821 --> 01:43:44.440
is in charge of now.
He's the president of the Marine Raider Association,

1754
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:50.140
which is a social organization,
not,
not an un,
no,
not as,
not a five,
one c three.

1755
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:51.920
Um,
and so

1756
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:56.990
<v 3>one of these guys are still alive today,
a World War II veterans.
Um,</v>

1757
01:43:56.991 --> 01:43:59.900
and so we get to go and meet with them and talk with them and hear these stories

1758
01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:01.630
of these amazing missions they did and,

1759
01:44:01.650 --> 01:44:06.570
and conducting a month long and patrols behind enemy lines,
um,

1760
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:10.580
you know,
sabotaging the Japanese and,
and different,
uh,

1761
01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:15.560
different battles.
Um,
and so these guys were very,

1762
01:44:15.561 --> 01:44:19.790
very vocal and outspoken to different leadership within the Marine Corps as

1763
01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:22.430
they're all in their nineties and passing away.
And I said,
Hey,

1764
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.210
one way to honor our legacy is to have a marine raider.

1765
01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.950
You don't have a Marine Raider unit today.

1766
01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:33.730
And that went over terribly with any leadership because if you don't know,

1767
01:44:36.441 --> 01:44:36.711
there's,

1768
01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:41.711
there's a pretty strong culture and brainwashing done within the Marine Corps

1769
01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.820
and it's from day one.
There's only one title that matters.

1770
01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.490
It's that you're a marine here,
it's one or a zero.
You're a marine,

1771
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.980
you already elite.
No one has special or everyone,

1772
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:55.430
everyone is special and no one is special.
You know,
you're all replaceable,

1773
01:44:55.431 --> 01:44:58.430
but you're all special.
Um,
which is the weirdest conundrum,

1774
01:44:58.431 --> 01:45:01.610
but all of us believe it.
And at the highest levels,
uh,

1775
01:45:01.611 --> 01:45:06.230
title of any unit you know,
that thinks you're special,
you know,

1776
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:08.240
is against the entire culture.

1777
01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:11.870
And so since formation,

1778
01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:16.900
since the marine special operations command was officially formed in 2006 from

1779
01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.480
the force reconnaissance units,
overnight,

1780
01:45:20.481 --> 01:45:22.730
they became the marine special operations command.

1781
01:45:22.731 --> 01:45:24.830
So literally changed the guide.
On a,

1782
01:45:24.831 --> 01:45:29.600
at a ceremony and then they're officially socom assets.
Um,

1783
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:35.270
there was this undercurrent,
this push from the lowest levels,
uh,

1784
01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:39.020
and guys were really strongly pushing this and saw the Raiders symbol.

1785
01:45:39.021 --> 01:45:41.410
The Raider logo from World War II was a,
you know,

1786
01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:45.470
a shield with the southern cross and a skull and a dagger in it.
Um,

1787
01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.840
and so are assuming the dagger sign there.

1788
01:45:47.841 --> 01:45:50.390
We have the dagger for some of our units now it's just the skull in the southern

1789
01:45:50.391 --> 01:45:51.590
cross.
Um,

1790
01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:56.780
and so guys would wear patches and patches are and other things that the Marine

1791
01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:59.030
Corps,
oh,
I know.
Beards.

1792
01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:04.250
Anything that is not in strict adherence with the uniform policy is not

1793
01:46:04.610 --> 01:46:09.380
tolerated.
And so,
you know,
that's a quick way to get,
get hammered.
Right.

1794
01:46:09.381 --> 01:46:11.720
It's just like,
you're not special.
What do you think you're doing?

1795
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:14.300
This is an authorized,
all that kind of stuff.
Whereas the army is like,
you know,

1796
01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:19.460
the army about,
hey,
I'm in the seal teams.
We have our points for flare.
Right?

1797
01:46:19.461 --> 01:46:22.760
Yeah.
So you guys aren't adding back.
So embarrassing.

1798
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.650
Expected to have like to look cool.
Right.
Um,

1799
01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:28.160
more than the Marine Corps.

1800
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:32.200
It was this consistent undercurrent pushing and pushing and pushing until it's

1801
01:46:32.210 --> 01:46:35.030
patches.
And then it became tattoos.

1802
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:37.700
So guys would get the Raider,

1803
01:46:37.701 --> 01:46:41.740
I'm blown just tattooed on their chest and then not wear skinny shirts.

1804
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:42.980
So you just see,
so like,
you know,

1805
01:46:42.981 --> 01:46:44.570
you're going into your first sergeant and they're like,

1806
01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:50.030
where's your skinny shirt?
Devil done.
Let's give a shirt on you.
Excuse

1807
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:54.930
<v 2>me.
Um,
and so it wasn't official until he was about two years ago,</v>

1808
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:59.960
year and a half ago after a decade of insurgency from the units that,

1809
01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:04.710
uh,
that we have a name and I think it's directly attributed to a album rec.

1810
01:47:04.711 --> 01:47:08.780
Raven actually.
So within SOCOM,
um,
he's a really smart guy,

1811
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:11.070
phenomenal commander obviously.
And uh,

1812
01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:16.020
he gets marketing and branding and just the basic,
you know,
title,
right?

1813
01:47:16.021 --> 01:47:19.530
Like you've earned the title of marine and within the special operations

1814
01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:23.520
community you are in the title of seal and Greenbrae.
And so he said,
hey,
my,

1815
01:47:23.521 --> 01:47:24.690
one of my last things I want to do,

1816
01:47:24.691 --> 01:47:27.570
like I want to work with the common on the Marine Corps.

1817
01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:31.000
I want you guys to get a title and yeah,
and it's,

1818
01:47:31.670 --> 01:47:36.630
it's not even about marketing and branding,
it's about heritage and unit pride.

1819
01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.320
I mean,
what,

1820
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:43.760
what more awesome thing then to take and keep alive that tradition from World

1821
01:47:43.801 --> 01:47:47.190
War Two of those guys in the service and sacrifice that they had.
It's,

1822
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:52.410
it's bad ass,
man.
It's awesome.
It's awesome.
Yeah.
As part of that too,

1823
01:47:52.411 --> 01:47:54.390
you know,
there's just like everything growing up,
right?

1824
01:47:54.391 --> 01:47:57.580
Like we're growing up as an organization,
so we're new to SOCOM,
so we're,

1825
01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:00.480
we're trying to figure it out as quick as we can.
Uh,

1826
01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:04.050
so we'd have our military special occupational specialty code.

1827
01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:07.500
So that took a while til we had to stay in the Raiders now for their whole

1828
01:48:07.501 --> 01:48:10.920
career.
Yes.
Oh,
that's awesome.
Yeah,
because initially when they started,

1829
01:48:10.921 --> 01:48:15.150
it wasn't the case,
right?
It was like,
well,
we'll let socom use you guys,

1830
01:48:15.151 --> 01:48:16.230
but then we want to use you to,

1831
01:48:16.231 --> 01:48:19.950
so every five years you're coming back to the fleet and you're going to be in an

1832
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:24.000
infantry company or a rifle platoon and stuff.
And they were like,
guys,

1833
01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.310
when I first joined the navy,
I've talked about this before,

1834
01:48:26.311 --> 01:48:27.450
when I first joined the navy,

1835
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:32.370
the Marines didn't have names on their uniforms because they didn't need them

1836
01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.570
because your name was lance corporal,
your name was staff sergeant.
And that's it.

1837
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:39.950
It was legit.
I always had a lot of respect for that.

1838
01:48:39.951 --> 01:48:41.660
But of course now they have them.
But uh,

1839
01:48:41.850 --> 01:48:46.080
I always thought that that that shows you,
there's like less slow,

1840
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:50.100
you know,
there's a slow change in the Marine Corps.

1841
01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:54.480
I'm sure some people would say that it's not good.
But,
uh,
yeah,

1842
01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:57.610
it just is,
it's just the Marine Corps be Green Weenie then

1843
01:48:59.130 --> 01:49:03.440
here it comes again.
Yeah.
It's uh,
it's good.
And so,
so we haven't,

1844
01:49:03.441 --> 01:49:07.770
I'm less guys can stick around.
We have,
uh,
a name,

1845
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:10.880
we have a badge now.
We have,
uh,
like a,
you know,

1846
01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:12.330
just like you guys have to try it out.
And we have a,

1847
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.530
a war eagle and using some of their gums,

1848
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:20.170
which is like a big eagle on a giant sword.
And uh,
so,
well the cool thing,

1849
01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:21.060
the cool thing,

1850
01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:26.060
the cool thing about the marine Raiders and about the marine special operations

1851
01:49:27.150 --> 01:49:31.360
is if you were in the navy,
in urine,

1852
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:35.020
the seal teams,
like you have nothing.
There's no crowd,

1853
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:39.320
there's almost no crossover.
There's almost no crime.

1854
01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:40.290
There's one,

1855
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:45.350
there's 3% crossover from the B U s navy to a seal team in terms of your skills,

1856
01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:48.100
right?
You're a guy

1857
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:53.100
<v 0>driving a shipper working a big 16 inch gun or working on a missile technology.</v>

1858
01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:55.540
That's what you do in the navy,
the seal teams,

1859
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:59.950
you're in a field with a machine gun,
there's zero crossover and that's horrible.

1860
01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:04.000
And in the Marine Corps it's like,
Oh,
you're an infantry man.
That totally,

1861
01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:09.060
I mean every skill is applicable and that is such an advantage to the marine

1862
01:50:09.071 --> 01:50:14.071
corps and it's such an advantage to the Raiders because you get guys that have

1863
01:50:14.261 --> 01:50:16.960
fundamental infantry skills when they roll in.

1864
01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:19.480
We have to teach guys infantry skills.

1865
01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:23.890
Once we've taught them sort of fundamental special operations type,

1866
01:50:23.891 --> 01:50:27.040
small unit tactics,
then we have to teach them conventional,
more,

1867
01:50:27.041 --> 01:50:30.670
more conventional movements just to get them up to speed.

1868
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:32.080
Because you got to know those things.

1869
01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:36.880
If you're out working with 140 Iraqi soldiers,
you can't,
that's,

1870
01:50:36.881 --> 01:50:38.380
that's not a small unit anymore.
You know,

1871
01:50:38.381 --> 01:50:42.100
you've got to go to think a little bit differently.
So you guys have that,

1872
01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:45.790
that advantage.
And that's an awesome and awesome thing.
I mean,

1873
01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:48.670
I remember the guys used to kind of complain about it when I was friends with a

1874
01:50:48.671 --> 01:50:50.620
bunch of force recon guys poking the do.

1875
01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:54.220
They would always complain about going to be billets like,
Hey,
I got to go,

1876
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:56.500
well not to be built,
but they'd have to go back to an infantry platoon.

1877
01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:00.010
And I would always think to myself,
man,
I'd go to an infantry platoon.

1878
01:51:00.011 --> 01:51:04.000
Are you kidding me?
Like,
it's awesome.
It's awesome.

1879
01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.520
And so I think that's a,
as an advantage.

1880
01:51:06.521 --> 01:51:09.850
So if there's any young ones out there that are thinking about your future,

1881
01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:15.090
think about the Marine Corps because you get that full spectrum of kind of land

1882
01:51:17.081 --> 01:51:19.180
warfare.
You get the amphibious side too,

1883
01:51:19.181 --> 01:51:23.410
but you get the full spectrum of infantry and yeah,
and that's awesome.

1884
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.530
And you don't want you,
it's hard to get that in the seal teams.

1885
01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:29.800
You get it over time.
But I got to where I got it from,

1886
01:51:29.801 --> 01:51:33.970
I got it from working with marines on our deployments and I got to see what a

1887
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.390
company movement looked like.
And that's where I learned it from.
Thank God.

1888
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:40.870
Cause by the time I was older and in Iraq working with the army and Marine
Corps,

1889
01:51:40.871 --> 01:51:43.270
I kind of had at least some semblance of knowledge about it.

1890
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:45.750
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
Couldn't agree more.</v>

1891
01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:50.060
And one of the good things about that as well for us as an organization is,
um,

1892
01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:56.040
we don't have street to sof,
right.
There's a period of time.
And so,
you know,

1893
01:51:56.041 --> 01:52:01.041
like you get to assess people and one of the best assessments you can make for

1894
01:52:02.851 --> 01:52:04.530
future performances of past performance.

1895
01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:07.200
And so if you've already got two to four years of observation in the Marine

1896
01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:07.210
Corps,

1897
01:52:07.210 --> 01:52:10.410
if you couldn't hack it in and if triple t and then you don't really deserve to

1898
01:52:10.411 --> 01:52:13.260
try out or make it to the special libraries committee,
but those lessons learned,

1899
01:52:13.261 --> 01:52:16.860
you're absolutely right.
It's,
it's exactly the same stuff.
So if you,
you know,

1900
01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:19.140
like for all those young motivators out there,

1901
01:52:19.141 --> 01:52:21.420
they want to become a marine or become the mar soc like first,

1902
01:52:21.570 --> 01:52:25.830
first step is just become marine,
be good,
great marina at whatever you do.

1903
01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:29.510
You be an entry,
like be great,
like be the best rifle,
then you can be,

1904
01:52:29.511 --> 01:52:34.230
be the best motorman machine gunner or whatever else it is.
Any Mos.
Yes.
Okay.

1905
01:52:34.231 --> 01:52:36.900
So that's awesome.
So you don't have to worry about what your mom says.

1906
01:52:36.901 --> 01:52:40.830
You won't get withheld.
No.
It's becoming more and more competitive and,

1907
01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.180
and uh,
if you're smart,
obviously,

1908
01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:46.080
I mean I always tell people just going infantry or

1909
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.990
<v 2>reconnaissance units because you know,</v>

1910
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:51.320
if you want to be a raider and you want to go do those sorts of things,

1911
01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:54.710
those skillsets are much more applicable.
It's better,

1912
01:52:54.711 --> 01:52:59.711
learn them early and become a master of those as opposed to a master of Admin or

1913
01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.210
supply or anything else.

1914
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:07.240
So what's Mos military operational specialty things.

1915
01:53:07.670 --> 01:53:10.880
So occupational specialty,
military.
So it's like what your job is,

1916
01:53:11.050 --> 01:53:14.240
got to be a rifleman.
You can be a machine gunner,
you can be a mortar men,

1917
01:53:14.241 --> 01:53:18.440
but you can also be an a mechanic.
You can be an it guy and you can be,

1918
01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.810
I mean there's marines that are due every job,

1919
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:24.530
every job that you can have in a same thing in the army.

1920
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:25.910
It's the same thing in the navy,
you know?

1921
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.290
And so that's why it used to be in the navy,

1922
01:53:30.291 --> 01:53:33.440
you had to have certain ratings if you were going to go in the seal teams.

1923
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:35.750
And so I was wondering if they did the same thing.

1924
01:53:35.751 --> 01:53:38.980
Like we only take guys from infantry.
Um,

1925
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:43.750
last thing I'll ask you about,
because I know we've been here for awhile.

1926
01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:48.470
You got to go.
You've got two sons and how's that gone?
It's awesome.

1927
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:53.720
How old are they?
Are Awesome.
They're almost 16 months old or 16 yeah,

1928
01:53:53.721 --> 01:53:57.230
16 months old.
Unless you're just in the full get some stage.
Yeah,

1929
01:53:57.410 --> 01:53:58.490
my wife is awesome.

1930
01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.570
So they can do a few things so they can run,

1931
01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:07.850
they can yell and they can throw things.
When I come home,

1932
01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.480
I just know that like she's been just getting run around getting thrown out and

1933
01:54:14.201 --> 01:54:18.920
I like yelled at cried diaper,
like the little thing.
And they're twins.
Yeah,

1934
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:23.750
giants too.
He's got a twin brother.
Yeah.
Yeah,
they're giants.
They're huge.

1935
01:54:24.010 --> 01:54:28.490
Isn't there like psychological things to watch out for with twins?
Like wa?

1936
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:32.630
I don't know.
Aren't they like hyper competitive?
Ah,
yeah.

1937
01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.970
Living away.
Let me give you one piece of advice.
I don't even,
I don't,
not a twin.

1938
01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:41.750
He's a twin.
Get your kids training Jujitsu when they're really young.

1939
01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:46.100
Because if you have a twin brother or even a brother that's close in age,

1940
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:49.310
you're going to be really good at Jujitsu because you have a natural training

1941
01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:51.800
partner,
youtube with all the time.
They're the same size as you.

1942
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:57.370
And there's some kids out there that are just sick and it's because they have

1943
01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:01.520
twins.
I mean,
I'm not just that,
I'm not trying to take away from them,

1944
01:55:01.521 --> 01:55:04.250
but it's a huge advantage if you've got a twin brother,

1945
01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.390
they should be grappling all lot.
I fully intend on that.

1946
01:55:08.391 --> 01:55:13.070
So that's one thing we didn't talk about,
but I love Jujitsu.
So I,

1947
01:55:13.071 --> 01:55:16.730
uh,
I got involved when I was a senior in high school.

1948
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:20.480
It just became like a in Jujitsu.
Yeah.
Like did you wrestle?

1949
01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:23.960
I did a little bit of wrestling and then I played mostly football and Lacrosse

1950
01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:27.080
and uh,
one of the guys,
I was a lifeguard too.

1951
01:55:27.081 --> 01:55:30.200
And so one of the guys that came by pool,
uh,
he was,
uh,

1952
01:55:30.230 --> 01:55:33.300
like a correctional officer and got hooked up with Ah,

1953
01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:37.190
some guys up in Philadelphia and uh,
started training.
So it was like me,

1954
01:55:37.191 --> 01:55:41.320
him and a couple other guys turn it in like a,
a church gym and um,

1955
01:55:41.530 --> 01:55:42.860
it's a train there and then went to the naval.

1956
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:46.190
One of the things that I did too was tried to start a Jujitsu club,

1957
01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:49.560
traveling club there.
Cause it was,
it was just coming up,
right.
I was like 2000,

1958
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:53.430
two,
2000,
three,
2004 and so trained and then did uh,

1959
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.950
did boxing dilemma May and um,

1960
01:55:56.350 --> 01:55:59.400
had a couple of fights and then like when it gradually became a marine and was

1961
01:55:59.401 --> 01:56:03.590
married was like put that on hold because I don't have time.
But yeah,
absolutely.

1962
01:56:03.730 --> 01:56:07.990
I going to have to walk up four kids.
I didn't put it on hold.
I got after it

1963
01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.860
fighting MMA fights on it.
No,
that's how I always have guys go,
well,
you know,
I,

1964
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:16.890
once I had kids,
I got two kids and then they kind of give me the look.

1965
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:20.970
The look for approval from my answer is I got four kids

1966
01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:26.940
get,
so you're already training anymore?
I'm not,
no,
no I haven't.
So I,
I uh,

1967
01:56:27.570 --> 01:56:28.530
I tried a little bit the marine corps,
you know,

1968
01:56:28.531 --> 01:56:30.330
we did some competitors and stuff and I did all that,

1969
01:56:30.331 --> 01:56:35.040
but I'm just focused on trying to do great infantry officer and so yeah.

1970
01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:39.630
Yeah.
Not going a friend Max Max Max is paralyzed.
Um,

1971
01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:43.830
chest down,
I would say.
Yeah.
He trains,

1972
01:56:44.970 --> 01:56:49.050
he trains,
had to come down and hook up with them sometime.
Yeah.
He's,
he's,

1973
01:56:49.051 --> 01:56:51.000
his grip has gotten a lot stronger.

1974
01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:58.050
Doing is all tight.
You know,
his grip is super strong now,
but um,
it's awesome.

1975
01:56:58.410 --> 01:57:01.170
But yeah.
Yeah.
No,
Jujitsu is a is good.

1976
01:57:01.171 --> 01:57:05.940
And with your twin boys it's going to be real good.
Um,
yeah man.

1977
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.840
Look.
Aye.
I,
we've been here,
we've been at it for awhile and a man,
just,

1978
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:11.220
just awesome.

1979
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:16.790
Awesome to hear you and talk to you a w where can people find you?

1980
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:23.340
So where should they look?
Twitter,
I'm on,

1981
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:28.320
on Facebook,
Instagram,
Linkedin,
the usual,
uh,
Twitter,

1982
01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:30.780
all that stuff.
Derek.
Derek Herrera.

1983
01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:36.840
That's [inaudible] dot com there's two r's in a row in Herrera and there's a

1984
01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:41.040
third.
So there's a total of three rs in there and available.

1985
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:46.020
Had had uh,
yeah,
but only one in your first name,
right?
Yeah,
first game.

1986
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:50.040
Each GRE or a dotcom.
And so that's a website.
Uh,

1987
01:57:50.370 --> 01:57:52.440
I haven't updated the blog in a while.
Been focused on,

1988
01:57:52.770 --> 01:57:53.940
on work and just doing that.

1989
01:57:53.941 --> 01:57:57.450
And so spinal singularity.com has some of the other stuff we're doing.
But,
um,

1990
01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.600
Facebook,
Instagram,
all the stuff's public and put anything out that's not,
yeah,

1991
01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:04.350
that's not private and,
uh,
really to define me.

1992
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:08.250
So I try to answer all the emails and messages and whatever else,

1993
01:58:08.251 --> 01:58:12.060
if anybody sends me notes.
So not hard to,
to track me down.

1994
01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:14.070
Awesome man.

you want to give time.

2001

Yeah.
Uh,
thanks for having me.

2005
01:58:50.110 --> 01:58:53.320
It's a pleasure to be here and share my story with you.

2006
01:58:53.470 --> 01:58:56.170
I'm not here doing this to seek the limelight for anything.

2007
01:58:56.171 --> 01:58:58.960
I'm doing it to try to be a good ambassador of the guys that are continue to go

2008
01:58:58.961 --> 01:59:02.370
forward and put their,
their lives on the line on a daily basis,
um,

2009
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:05.710
who can't talk about what they do or advocate for themselves.
Um,

2010
01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:07.210
a lot of people to think,

2011
01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:10.960
my wife in particular who's been there for me every step of the way.
Um,

2012
01:59:11.230 --> 01:59:14.170
the foundation,
the Marine Raider Foundation,
and all the people associated with,

2013
01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:16.040
with the organization,
uh,

2014
01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:20.890
my team who saved my life and wouldn't be here without them.
And uh,
you know,

2015
01:59:21.130 --> 01:59:23.890
all the guys that are out there continue to lay it down on a daily basis.

2016
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:25.743
Awesome,
man.

2017
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:28.080
<v 0>Well,
like I said,
it's,</v>

2018
01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:32.460
it's been an honor to sit here and talk to you and hear your story and what

2019
01:59:32.461 --> 01:59:35.970
you've been through and your sacrifice being be even beyond what you did in the

2020
01:59:35.970 --> 01:59:38.940
Marine Corps,
what you're still doing,
building your business and with the,

2021
01:59:39.930 --> 01:59:44.930
with the foundation and most important I think is just to set this incredible

2022
01:59:47.101 --> 01:59:52.101
example to this day of what it means to never surrender of what it means to

2023
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:58.980
never quit and what it means to never give up regardless of the challenge that

2024
01:59:58.981 --> 02:00:01.590
you're facing.
Man,
that's awesome.

2025
02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:06.860
So I appreciate the example you set for me and for everyone and thanks for

2026
02:00:07.141 --> 02:00:11.970
coming on and sharing it a little bit.
Thank you.
Pleasure's all mine.
Awesome.

2027
02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:18.810
And Derek has left the building,
obviously.

2028
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:23.870
Awesome to have him on and hear about his story.

2029
02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:28.050
So
Echo.
Yes.

2030
02:00:28.230 --> 02:00:30.390
If somebody wants to support this podcast,
how can they do it

2031
02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:34.750
<v 5>anyways?
We will.
Well,
actually,</v>

2032
02:00:35.370 --> 02:00:38.260
and I meant to kind of,
I didn't want to interrupt,
but you know,
the,

2033
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:43.430
what do you call it?
The something d,
The decompression.
Needle down decompression.

2034
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:47.650
Yeah.
Okay.
I guess I should ask him that,

2035
02:00:47.651 --> 02:00:48.610
but is that like,

2036
02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:52.360
can you feel that you know like when you know when it goes in because they can a

2037
02:00:52.361 --> 02:00:57.350
damn needle into you through your rib cage and into your lungs?
Yeah.

2038
02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:00.550
Yeah.
Remember you want to see if you can feel it.

2039
02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.300
I'll stick a needle through your chest.
Yeah,
no,
no,
no.

2040
02:01:04.301 --> 02:01:09.260
I remember that movie three kings when they did that.
Mark Wahlberg.
Yes.
No,

2041
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:14.890
they did that.
I'm pretty sure.
Okay.
Anyway.
All right.

2042
02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:19.570
You don't want to do like that movie.
Hey.
Yeah.
All right,
cool.
Anyway,

2043
02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.170
yes.
How can we support,
how can we support ourselves?
That's the question.

2044
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:28.990
First way is to stay on the path.
Keep working out,
keep eating healthy.

2045
02:01:28.991 --> 02:01:31.540
That's the hardest one.
I mean,
Derek,

2046
02:01:31.541 --> 02:01:35.260
we're talking on a side note like eating healthy is kind of the hardest part

2047
02:01:35.261 --> 02:01:40.030
about this whole stain on the path page.
Could be.
Yeah,
I cause it's like the,

2048
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.820
well then again,
working out can,
it depends on who you are.

2049
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:45.260
Either way you want to stay on the path.

2050
02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:48.970
One of those elements of the path it's required now is Jujitsu.

2051
02:01:50.110 --> 02:01:53.180
True.
You agree,
right?
Yup.
Would anyway,

2052
02:01:53.210 --> 02:01:54.590
when you did you just say you're going to need a g,

2053
02:01:54.591 --> 02:01:58.730
go to origin main.com get whatever g you want.
Doesn't matter the color.
Oh,
no,
no,

2054
02:01:58.731 --> 02:02:02.100
no.
Check with your instructor.
Getting ahead of myself.
Hey,
hey.

2055
02:02:02.170 --> 02:02:06.860
Check with your personal moral compass.
You W G that's not white.

2056
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:12.050
Yeah.
So what do you mean tradition?
The tradition,
like,
yeah.

2057
02:02:12.051 --> 02:02:14.870
You know,
Pete consciously tries to,

2058
02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:20.110
like you serp my personality by,

2059
02:02:20.190 --> 02:02:23.840
he always,
he won't give me a white g.
He only gives me a blue g,

2060
02:02:23.850 --> 02:02:28.400
a black gay or whatever.
He wants to try and break me out of this tradition,

2061
02:02:29.210 --> 02:02:32.250
which he successfully done because now I have all different colored gies.
Yeah,

2062
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:33.343
there you go.

2063
02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:37.640
But I wouldn't say that violates your moral situation.

2064
02:02:37.670 --> 02:02:42.500
That's more of a style thing.
Okay.
Which violates my,
yeah,
I guess so.
Yeah,

2065
02:02:42.501 --> 02:02:46.130
a little bit,
Huh?
Either way.
Yeah,
but I guess I can,

2066
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:49.370
I can claim a small victory because I can be like,
oh,

2067
02:02:49.371 --> 02:02:52.450
I don't care what color it is.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
That's true.
Little,

2068
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:55.090
little moral victory back in my direction,
cause nothing,

2069
02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:56.870
let it not like you're sitting around being like,
hey,

2070
02:02:56.871 --> 02:03:00.290
maybe I should grab up green gate cause that would make me like that.

2071
02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.200
That'd be awesome.
Just opening the package from Pete going,
Oh yeah,

2072
02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:07.610
he's going to be a blue Geek.
Whatever.
It's still on wearing.
Cool.
Thanks man.

2073
02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.970
Oh,
so yeah.
Get a gay man.
Whatever color you want.

2074
02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:14.930
After you checked with the instructor and your moral compass compass,

2075
02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:20.840
I guess I'm also rash guards.
Biggest selling g color is,

2076
02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:25.900
do you know white?
Nope.
Black.
Yes.
Dan,
come on.

2077
02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.620
We had this conference.
We had that conversation with Pete.

2078
02:03:27.621 --> 02:03:28.700
Everybody wants to be a Ninja.

2079
02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:30.700
Everybody wanted it to be an intern when they were little.
Oh,

2080
02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:32.660
I didn't know you were saying.
That's about the most selling.

2081
02:03:32.661 --> 02:03:36.710
I thought that that was like everybody wants to be a Ninja and it makes the
gete.

2082
02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:39.950
The Ninjas had a black geese apparently from what we know,

2083
02:03:40.930 --> 02:03:45.930
they had special shoes with the toe the night she goes

2084
02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:48.860
either way,

2085
02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:52.610
rash guards as you've got to swing rash guards for Nogi or for whatever kind of

2086
02:03:52.611 --> 02:03:53.444
activity.

2087
02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:58.480
You can get tee shirts there and you can get supplements Giacosa those

2088
02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.870
supplements during warfare for your joints.
Krill oil for your all around

2089
02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:09.530
hell discipline get you to get you in the zone.

2090
02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:13.610
Which JP,
I sent me a text and he's like,

2091
02:04:13.670 --> 02:04:16.910
how are you still saying Dave Burke is the rep?
Oh,

2092
02:04:16.911 --> 02:04:21.911
you're going to discipline these more because JP is more disciplined and he's on

2093
02:04:22.371 --> 02:04:24.020
discipline.
Go,
okay,

2094
02:04:24.021 --> 02:04:29.021
yeah that will go pill the discipline go pill and he's all,

2095
02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:31.460
he sent a picture of uh,

2096
02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:37.560
some like super high speed thing and he's like,
this is me on discipline.

2097
02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:42.660
Go
Jp is what he called jockeying for.

2098
02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:47.680
He wasn't playing goal representative position and he thinks Dave Burke cause

2099
02:04:47.881 --> 02:04:51.710
day Burke has sort of the Oji disciplined player.
Good deal.
Guilty.
Yeah,

2100
02:04:52.930 --> 02:04:55.970
he is.
Well,
it,
let's face it,
Dave Burke,
he's pretty,

2101
02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:59.190
he's going to be perfect regardless because he's such a like boom,

2102
02:04:59.191 --> 02:05:02.490
high achiever dude from day one,
you know,

2103
02:05:02.610 --> 02:05:06.480
so you know JP is a loose cannon so he can be the representative.

2104
02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.740
Well he can't be a loose cannon.
He's not.

2105
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:11.580
He can be the representative discipline goal because he's disciplined.

2106
02:05:11.581 --> 02:05:15.930
But he'd go eat.
He goes,
I think the funny thing you don't mean loose cannon.

2107
02:05:15.931 --> 02:05:19.200
What you mean to say Jay about JP is JP.
He's fired up.
He's fired up.

2108
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:22.190
And what's funny is JP does need though disciplines.

2109
02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:25.410
That's why he's not the best representative.
Cause I'm like JP,

2110
02:05:25.890 --> 02:05:30.520
we're going to get more in the game.
He's in the game.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2111
02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:32.820
You need to.
So JP,

2112
02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:37.880
well we'll just give them a mutual support supporting assets behind the

2113
02:05:39.991 --> 02:05:44.040
discipline.
So yeah,
you can discipline,
you can also get milk,
milk,
chocolate,

2114
02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:46.230
peanut butter,
chocolate,
vanilla gorilla,

2115
02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:51.000
which is supposedly named after Leif Babin from what I understand.

2116
02:05:52.290 --> 02:05:56.250
And the darkness and other than the warrior kid milk,
strawberry and chocolate.

2117
02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:59.010
Try those out.
Even if you're an adult.

2118
02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.620
I hate to say it but I was thinking about this.

2119
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:06.360
Have you ever as an adult drink a strawberry quick?
Yes.
Yes.
You have.

2120
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:08.360
I have big time.
Yeah.

2121
02:06:09.090 --> 02:06:12.390
Well now we don't have to do that anymore because now you can get something

2122
02:06:12.391 --> 02:06:14.550
that's literally completely healthy.

2123
02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:18.690
What was the one there was like that wasn't quick that they tried to skew or

2124
02:06:18.691 --> 02:06:22.320
angle is healthy,
right?
That was,
they couldn't do that.
Some other ones,

2125
02:06:22.321 --> 02:06:25.030
some other chocolate.
I know onto that.
Yeah.

2126
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:29.510
I forget it had vitamin and then the only tried the work in multi level team.

2127
02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:32.270
They might try and skew.
That's all.

2128
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:36.960
Come on and go look at the ingredients and then we'll compare that to two Malke.

2129
02:06:37.410 --> 02:06:39.630
Yeah.
You know what that stuff has in it.
A bunch of sugar.

2130
02:06:39.631 --> 02:06:44.180
You know mark hasn't it?
Moke
direct from bulk.

2131
02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.190
I dig it.
So yeah,

2132
02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:51.670
get all that stuff from origin may not come.
Yeah.

2133
02:06:52.050 --> 02:06:54.690
Also if you want to represent Jocko has a store.

2134
02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:59.070
Everybody Christmas is coming up.
This is what I'm doing.

2135
02:06:59.790 --> 02:07:04.450
I'm going to activate.
It's funny cause I'm saying it like this is new thing.

2136
02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.840
It's just like such an old think a gift card

2137
02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:11.870
gift card on Jocko store.com.
So it's like,
you know,

2138
02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:16.840
like okay your brother or whoever doesn't,
it's like in the game,
I don't know.

2139
02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:21.630
Well you know,
whatever your cousin,
whoever,
and they're in the game,
they want,

2140
02:07:21.631 --> 02:07:23.490
you know,
and you say,
Hey,
you know what?

2141
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:27.800
I can't pick out what I want for you from here.
You just pick out what you want.

2142
02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:30.690
Bolton.
There you go.
Gift Card.
Boom.
Nonetheless.
You know what?

2143
02:07:30.691 --> 02:07:34.230
I'm leaving this completely in your hands.
You know why I don't give gifts,

2144
02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:37.090
I don't like gifts and gift cards just aren't a thing for me.

2145
02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:39.220
I've never given anyone a gift card ever.

2146
02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:42.820
And so that's going to be your deal over there on your side of the tracks.

2147
02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:46.080
That's exactly what I was thinking when I was making it.
I was like,
okay,

2148
02:07:46.290 --> 02:07:49.630
this goes against kind of Jocko thinks that you don't want me to do on the gift

2149
02:07:49.631 --> 02:07:51.640
card.
Uh,
virtual representation.

2150
02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:55.120
I'm going to put your face right in the middle of it.
Boom.
That's what I did.

2151
02:07:55.450 --> 02:07:58.690
So there you go on it.
So it's Kinda like,
yeah,
it's a gift card,

2152
02:07:58.691 --> 02:08:01.600
but it's kind of from Jocko.
Since you don't give gifts,
boom.

2153
02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:06.850
There you go.
Anyway,
on there there's some good shirts you want to represent.

2154
02:08:06.851 --> 02:08:10.120
Discipline equals freedom,
you know,
any kind of,
how should I say,

2155
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:14.980
philosophy and the path.
Some good stuff on there.
Some rash guards as well.

2156
02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:19.090
And hoodies,
tank tops.
I know it's winter,
I dig it.

2157
02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:21.670
But if you're in Honolulu,
Pearl Harbor,

2158
02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:27.160
wherever you can still represent the tank top this time of year.
Um,
but yeah,

2159
02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:29.320
a lot of good stuff on there.
Jocko store,
Dotcom,

2160
02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:31.990
deaf of course stuff to the core.

2161
02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:37.570
Also subscribe to subscribe to the podcast.

2162

iTunes,
Google play and

2163
02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:48.520
Spotify.
And I listen to Spotify,
I barely know what it is,

2164
02:08:48.521 --> 02:08:50.480
but I hear good things and you know,

2165
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:55.420
we're on there and you know what it Spotify play like mixed tapes kind of.

2166
02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:59.350
Is that the theory behind it?
I don't know man.
Yeah.
I don't know either.

2167
02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.280
You can get the podcast there as well.
He can,
yeah,

2168
02:09:02.710 --> 02:09:07.240
you can ask Alexa for the podcast.
A Lek.
Okay.

2169
02:09:07.241 --> 02:09:09.700
And don't be confused with that.
I think we went over this before.

2170
02:09:09.770 --> 02:09:14.500
Some people think that it's an Alexa,
not Alexa.
That's like saying I have,

2171
02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:16.670
it's not an iPhone,
it's a Siri.
No,

2172
02:09:16.690 --> 02:09:20.700
Siri is the the girl inside Alexis,

2173
02:09:20.710 --> 02:09:25.240
the girl inside the device called Amazon Echo check later.

2174
02:09:26.110 --> 02:09:28.660
Anyway.
Yes.
I'm the five to see if you haven't already and leave a review.

2175
02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:32.440
If you're in the mood.
Don't forget about the warrior kid podcast,

2176
02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:37.250
which I just posted a new one last week and got a lot of really cool uh,

2177
02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:41.740
feedback on that one.
And
Yeah,

2178
02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:44.740
I think once people got that one,
cause I don't talk about it,

2179
02:09:44.770 --> 02:09:46.530
I don't post very much about it.
But anyways,

2180
02:09:46.690 --> 02:09:50.100
a bunch of people downloaded all of them because they're,

2181
02:09:50.101 --> 02:09:52.510
they're cool and they're good.

2182
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:58.270
I believe the word is conversation starters with your children.

2183
02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:00.160
That's what a lot of people said.
Like,
oh,

2184
02:10:00.161 --> 02:10:05.161
I finally had the conversation that I needed to have with my kids about,

2185
02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:08.440
well in that case,

2186
02:10:08.530 --> 02:10:13.530
warrior kid podcast number 19 about making good decisions and making bad

2187
02:10:14.261 --> 02:10:16.900
decisions and how if you make some bad decisions along the way,

2188
02:10:17.410 --> 02:10:21.010
you could ruin everything.
Yeah,
yeah,
totally.
And you,

2189
02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:26.160
what's interesting about that one too is I have the supreme luxury of being able

2190
02:10:26.201 --> 02:10:29.140
to listen to all of these wild,
they happen,
right?
These podcasts.

2191
02:10:29.141 --> 02:10:32.170
But on top of that,
if I have a specific question for myself,

2192
02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:33.590
I can just ask you do you know?

2193
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:37.820
But like even though I might already kind of know the answer,

2194
02:10:38.150 --> 02:10:39.320
but when you deal with kids,

2195
02:10:39.321 --> 02:10:44.200
you can't just deliver certain information the same way you would as an adult,

2196
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:48.620
like your friends.
So I'm like,
man,
how do I approach this specific situation?

2197
02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:53.810
And the way that,
and the way you do it in warrior kid is the same way.
Like you,

2198
02:10:53.811 --> 02:10:55.190
you kind of tell it to me or whatever.

2199
02:10:55.490 --> 02:11:00.140
It's that alleviates so much stress when like when you need to approach your

2200
02:11:00.141 --> 02:11:01.160
kids with this skin stuff.

2201
02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:06.180
Or one thing that everyone says is this is what I try and tell my kids.

2202
02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:09.020
They don't listen to me,
which is exactly what I'm talking about.

2203
02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:11.840
They listened to uncle did no one listen to me that this not uncle Jake.

2204
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:16.820
Let Uncle Jake tell him what's what Uncle Jake speaks the truth and they and

2205
02:11:16.821 --> 02:11:20.690
they accept it from Uncle Jake.
Yeah.
Oddly enough.
Yes sir.

2206
02:11:21.110 --> 02:11:23.610
Also youtube if you like,

2207
02:11:23.630 --> 02:11:27.440
if you were interested in the video version of this podcast,

2208
02:11:27.441 --> 02:11:29.570
you to see what [inaudible] looks like.
You got to do with Derek,
looks like,

2209
02:11:30.150 --> 02:11:32.330
let me see what I look like.
If that's your thing.

2210
02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.010
If you haven't seen the two minute trailer for the Mikey and the dragons book,

2211
02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:38.510
you can get that on youtube,

2212
02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:43.660
which by the way is epic and I don't use that term lightly.
It's cool.

2213
02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:48.700
Echo sent me the for approval text with that radio in it and I watched it and I

2214
02:11:51.471 --> 02:11:54.710
wrote back,
this is the best video I've ever seen in my entire life.

2215
02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:01.730
All caps.
Yeah.
Good.
And then I went and read youtube comments so far.

2216
02:12:01.731 --> 02:12:05.210
No one has said echoes Jack,
cause you're not in the video.
Yeah.
Which is,

2217
02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:09.480
which is Supreme Lee.
Cool.
But no,
what's cool is people are,

2218
02:12:09.590 --> 02:12:12.800
are saying about a two minute video,
a cartoon video about a kid's book.

2219
02:12:12.801 --> 02:12:16.610
People are saying that they got tears in her eyes that they got chills.

2220
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:20.270
It's a legit video.
Yeah,
it's awesome.
So yeah,

2221
02:12:20.271 --> 02:12:24.620
you can get that if you go to the youtube channel and then while you're doing

2222
02:12:24.621 --> 02:12:28.960
that you can subscribe to it to,
to the youtube channel if you want.

2223
02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:33.500
Get the big,
you know,
subscriptions.

2224
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:39.920
And then you can also,
you can get,
you can get psychological warfare from iTunes,

2225
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:41.870
Google play,
MP three,
whatever.

2226
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:46.610
And that's me telling you to do the right thing and making you do it.
Yeah.

2227
02:12:46.611 --> 02:12:49.940
So just give it a shot through it.
True.
Also,

2228
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:51.520
when you want to vary up your workout,

2229
02:12:51.540 --> 02:12:54.050
you want to add kettle bells to your workout,
get on at kettle bells,

2230
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:58.370
go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko some good stuff on their workout stuff.

2231
02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:01.010
A lot of good stuff on it.
Good information too,
by the way.

2232
02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:07.010
So go in there on it.com/jocko Jocko white tea.

2233
02:13:08.090 --> 02:13:08.780
Yes,

2234
02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:13.780
tastes delicious and is very good for you and it gives you an 8,000 pound dead

2235
02:13:15.051 --> 02:13:18.650
lift.
So give that one a try.
I also got some books.
We got

2236
02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:24.170
Mike in the dragons.
Okay,
update.
I am printing them as fast as I can.

2237
02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.640
There's a bunch of printers that are printing new copies of Mike and the
dragons.

2238
02:13:28.670 --> 02:13:31.250
Some of them are already been shipped.
There'll be going to Amazon.

2239
02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:34.980
We are going to be cutting it close right now.
Actually.

2240
02:13:35.010 --> 02:13:37.050
We should be good people that are ordering well.

2241
02:13:37.050 --> 02:13:39.660
It's going to be cutting costs depending on when you exactly order,

2242
02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:43.560
whether it gets you by Christmas or not.
But the faster you order,

2243
02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:45.510
the better chance you will have of getting it before Christmas.

2244
02:13:45.511 --> 02:13:50.511
I apologize that I did not order enough books to be printed and that is my fault

2245
02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:54.540
and I should have done better.
And as Sarah Armstrong pointed out to me,

2246
02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:55.980
she's like,
Oh yeah,

2247
02:13:56.070 --> 02:13:58.650
well you know why you didn't order enough books cause you thought,

2248
02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:01.020
oh well Sarah will get a book.
And Andrew Paul,

2249
02:14:01.021 --> 02:14:04.140
we'll get a book and I also get a book and then everyone posts with,
they got,

2250
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:08.070
Andrew got 20 copies.
Sarah got 10 copies of Iris,
got 10 cops.

2251
02:14:08.071 --> 02:14:11.580
So everyone's buying multiple copies because it's the ultimate Christmas gift

2252
02:14:11.581 --> 02:14:16.581
for anyone between the ages of zero and 10 or 12 anyways,

2253
02:14:18.451 --> 02:14:19.380
Mike in the dragons,

2254
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:24.360
order it as quick as you can and we will try and get it to you by Christmas.

2255
02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:28.740
If not,
hey,
uh,
what's the next holiday after Christmas?
New Years.
Okay.

2256
02:14:28.741 --> 02:14:32.820
Maybe they'll get a new kid and here's gift and or what's after that Easter?

2257
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:37.920
Well,
technically the Easter.
Oh,
well technically,

2258
02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:43.000
okay.
You get Valentine's Day gift for your children,
I guess.
Do.

2259
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:47.240
You should do that and if not,
you know,
just get it for him.
Yeah.

2260
02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:51.750
Yeah.
That's a good one.
That's a fun one that you mentioned,
that video,

2261
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:57.480
the goal there was to kind of sent,
try to capture what it's like,
like reading,

2262
02:14:57.481 --> 02:15:00.660
you know how long you would read a book he goes on in your head and so you

2263
02:15:00.661 --> 02:15:02.970
capture what's going on in that book in your head.

2264
02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:06.300
How you're reading it to your key.
Kind of capture that in a little summary.

2265
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:07.223
That's what it was.

2266
02:15:07.230 --> 02:15:10.200
I think it did because that's really how I felt when I read that book to my

2267
02:15:10.201 --> 02:15:13.110
daughter.
It's good that you do voices.
When you'd read that book.

2268
02:15:13.111 --> 02:15:17.070
Let me hear the king voice.
Come on man.

2269
02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:20.670
I'm not going to hurt mine to my song Yak cause it really is,

2270
02:15:20.671 --> 02:15:24.390
but rather is classified so you got to at least just give us a to my son.

2271
02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:29.450
Too Much Sun.
That was all fine.

2272
02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:35.320
It sounds way better when I read a terror.
Understand that.
Wow.
I also,

2273
02:15:35.321 --> 02:15:40.090
and I feel like a voice actor over here compared to that one.
You kind of,

2274
02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:44.490
Oh hey,
moving on.
Yeah.
Mike and the dragons.
Awesome book.

2275
02:15:44.491 --> 02:15:46.200
Also way of the warrior kid.

2276
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:52.430
One end to from wimpy to warrior kid and then Mark's mission.

2277
02:15:53.911 --> 02:15:55.140
That's number one.
Number two,

2278
02:15:56.490 --> 02:16:00.840
also important critical books.
I personally think,

2279
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:05.870
or the one that my daughter requests me to read again and again and again is

2280
02:16:06.301 --> 02:16:10.170
part to mark Mark's mission.
That's interesting.
She really likes Nathan,

2281
02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:11.641
Nathan James.

2282
02:16:11.641 --> 02:16:16.260
She likes that idea of that irritating person because that's how kids are.

2283
02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:19.530
They always talking,
you know,
wait until she meets Danny Reinhart,

2284
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:23.730
Danny Reinhardt book three.
I'm in the process of writing right now.

2285
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:28.740
10 chapters deep.
Danny Reinhart shows up.
So yeah,
she'll,

2286
02:16:28.770 --> 02:16:32.170
she'll any Reinhart even though my youngest daughter,
we're not,

2287
02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:36.190
when she found out about the character Danny Reinhardt and who he was,

2288
02:16:36.191 --> 02:16:40.420
and now she goes,
Tanny Reinhart
cause the character,

2289
02:16:40.421 --> 02:16:45.040
he's like good at everything.
That's the premise of warrior kid three the,

2290
02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:50.080
there's no bully per se.
There's actually a kid that's a good kid.

2291
02:16:50.170 --> 02:16:53.500
He's good at Jujitsu,
he's good at pull ups,
he's good at running,

2292
02:16:53.501 --> 02:16:55.780
he's good at everything and he's nice.

2293
02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:59.050
And that Rob's marked the wrong way because all of a sudden he's got someone

2294
02:16:59.051 --> 02:17:02.260
that he's jealous of it and his ego.
And what's that guy's name?

2295
02:17:02.261 --> 02:17:06.640
His name is Danny Ryan.
How awesome is that?
So like,

2296
02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:10.600
what am I told my daughter that she was like Danny Reinhardt and she says,
oh,

2297
02:17:10.690 --> 02:17:13.090
she says what a Danny Reinhardt do today.

2298
02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:18.160
But at well you kind of can anticipate that your son or daughter that you're

2299
02:17:18.161 --> 02:17:22.480
reading it to,
or the person reading the,
you know,
if they're of a reading age,

2300
02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:25.780
they're going to like Danny Reinhardt.
They are,
but they're,

2301
02:17:25.810 --> 02:17:29.350
I don't know if they're going to,
they might,
they might side with Mark A.

2302
02:17:29.350 --> 02:17:32.260
Little bit.
Cause you can hear Mark's getting annoyed cause Danny just heal.

2303
02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:36.760
He does this,
he taps heel,
tap someone out and say like,
ah,
you know,

2304
02:17:36.761 --> 02:17:40.180
I must have got lucky.
He's one of those kind of guys were like,

2305
02:17:40.330 --> 02:17:42.960
he beats him in a running race and he's like,
Oh yeah,
you know,
I was,

2306
02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:47.380
I was feeling pretty good today.
I guess guys,
he won't take credit for anything,

2307
02:17:47.381 --> 02:17:50.530
which is,
and,
and since it's already bothers mark that he lost,

2308
02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:55.110
he said yeah.
And plus we all been on the mission since,
you know,

2309
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:58.150
be since before mark could even do pullups we've been with them the whole time,

2310
02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:01.870
so we're feeling his pain with them.
So now this guy,
Danny,

2311
02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:06.160
he hasn't felt any pain.
Forget,
they just naturally good at everything.

2312
02:18:06.161 --> 02:18:07.110
I screw that guy.
Yeah.

2313
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:10.240
So that's Danny Reinhart and that's going to be coming out in the spring.

2314
02:18:10.241 --> 02:18:11.890
Hopefully if I finish it in time,

2315
02:18:11.891 --> 02:18:15.430
but which I will discipline equals freedom field manual.

2316
02:18:15.670 --> 02:18:16.810
You can get that book too.

2317
02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:20.620
That's another book that you can get for the holiday season is,

2318
02:18:20.621 --> 02:18:23.590
let's just say that if it,

2319
02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:28.660
it might kind of mess up like jam up someone's New Year a little bit if they try

2320
02:18:28.661 --> 02:18:30.940
and get on the path.
Like for Christmas,

2321
02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.600
like what pre New Year's resolutions scenario.
Yeah.
Oh,
maybe they,

2322
02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:37.530
maybe they use that to kick off the new year's resolution.

2323
02:18:37.550 --> 02:18:40.480
They get a little deathcore.
Yeah,
but here's the thing though.

2324
02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:46.030
I think you might even say it in that book.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I've said,
oh,

2325
02:18:46.031 --> 02:18:47.890
new years now.

2326
02:18:48.670 --> 02:18:52.770
I've said that many times and I believe it's to this moment.
Yeah.
So yeah,

2327
02:18:52.810 --> 02:18:55.070
that's the district was greenfield manual.
The,

2328
02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:59.770
the audio version of that is not an audible,
it is on,
it's an MP.
Three thing.

2329
02:18:59.830 --> 02:19:03.130
Itunes,
Amazon music,
Google play,
extreme ownership.

2330
02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:07.240
That's the first leadership I wrote book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin.

2331
02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:10.570
We followed that up with the dichotomy of leadership,

2332
02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:16.440
which is possibly better anyways.

2333
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:19.240
You should check it out.

2334
02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:24.300
It will teach you how to pragmatically apply the policies,

2335
02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:28.100
put forth in extreme ownership into your

2336
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:29.083
<v 0>world.</v>

2337
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:35.810
We also have a leadership consultant company.
We saw prompts to leadership.

2338
02:19:35.811 --> 02:19:39.380
That's what we do.
It's me,
Lafe,
Bab and JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,
Flynn Cochran,

2339
02:19:39.381 --> 02:19:43.970
Mike's Rally,
Mike,
bye Ma and if you want to find out about that,

2361
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:15.050
on Instagram or on Facebook,

2362
02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:20.660
d Baja Echo is an echo.

2363
02:21:20.661 --> 02:21:23.360
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2364
02:21:23.390 --> 02:21:27.440
And thanks to all our military personnel out there holding the line,

2365
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:33.790
we can do what we do because you are doing what you do and we will never forget

2366
02:21:34.911 --> 02:21:35.744
that.

2367
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:40.830
And special thanks to the Marine Raiders for your legacy of bravery that will

2368
02:21:43.461 --> 02:21:44.870
never be forgotten.

2369
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:49.820
And obviously Derek Herrera for his service,

2370
02:21:49.850 --> 02:21:52.250
his sacrifice.
And like I said to him,

2371
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:57.670
the incredible example that he sets thanks to policing,

2372
02:21:58.490 --> 02:22:00.260
law enforcement,
firefighters,
paramedics,

2373
02:22:00.261 --> 02:22:03.860
EMT is correctional officer's border patrol,
all first responders.

2374
02:22:04.730 --> 02:22:06.920
Thank you for keeping us safe here at home.

2375
02:22:06.921 --> 02:22:09.620
And the rest of you that are out there listening,

2376
02:22:14.130 --> 02:22:17.760
I know things don't always go the way we want them to go,

2377
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:24.530
but I think just listening to Derek today,

2378
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:31.040
<v 5>I think there's no doubt that that is the attitude you take.</v>

2379
02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:34.560
You don't focus on what is wrong.
You focus on what is right.

2380
02:22:34.561 --> 02:22:38.310
You don't focus on what you can't do.
You focus on what you can do.

2381
02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:41.580
You're thankful that you have these opportunities.

2382
02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:45.120
That's so many didn't get.

2383
02:22:46.770 --> 02:22:51.570
Then you take that attitude and then you go out there and get after it.

2384
02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:58.070
And until next time,
this is echo and Jocko out.
