00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.720
This is Jocko podcast number 28 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.810
Jocko Willink.
He was a mate,

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.620
a real good mate.

4
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:18.621
He was a friendly sort of fella liked the joke and if it had to happen,

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.680
it's a shame it had to happen to such a decent bloke.

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.560
But Ah,
fair.

7
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:32.561
Dinkum don't it make you wonder what God and heavens thinking about up there,

8
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.580
the way he chooses who does sacrifice to me,

9
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.560
it doesn't quite seem fair.

10
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.900
<v 0>You'd think he'd want to blow to take a bloke like me could be no loss to no one</v>

12
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:50.660
here on earth.
But no,

13
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.150
he always seems to pick the best.

14
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.140
Whose life amounts to 10 times what mine's worth.

15
00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.340
<v 0>Now there's a sort of aching here inside.</v>

17
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.090
I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong,

18
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.300
but a soldier can afford to feel this way.

19
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.630
He's got a grit his teeth and carry on.

20
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.610
So how's a bloke supposed to deal with this?
I know they trained me well.

21
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.840
I can't complain.

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.480
But this is something you don't learn about when they teach you how to play the

23
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:28.560
soldiers game.

24
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.170
They teach you how to shoot and how to kill you.

25
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:36.940
Even learn which enemy to hate,

26
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.050
but nowhere in their training do you learn

27
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.270
how to live with the loss of a real good mate.

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.453
<v 1>Hm.</v>

29
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.320
<v 0>Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.
Good [inaudible].</v>

30
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.600
That is an excerpt from a poem called,

31
00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:02.890
he was a made by a man named Lackland Irvine,

32
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.940
who's an Australian guy served in Vietnam as part of the three Ra are the Third

33
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.330
Battalion Royal Australian Regiment.

34
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.531
<v 0>And you know,</v>

36
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:22.330
you look at the Vietnam War and there was definitely some major advances in

37
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:27.040
terms of technology because they had now things like helicopters and

38
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.500
better radios and they had the beginning of night vision and they had jets and

39
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:34.090
better communication.

40
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.650
But even with all those technological changes,

41
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:45.460
the basic principles of combat remained the same.

42
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.910
They always do cover,
move,
keep things simple,

43
00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:51.760
prioritize next cute decentralized command.

44
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.540
But in addition to those technological changes,

45
00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:59.950
there was different says now with the people,

46
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.220
obviously in Vietnam there was a massive antiwar movement in America and around

47
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:12.381
the world and in America a lot of the troops were draftees.

48
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.771
<v 0>Now,</v>

50
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:22.530
this is something I have to explain all the time and I have explained it on here

51
00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:27.531
before and that is that seals and soldiers and marines are not robots.

52
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.870
There are people,
and even though seals for instance,

53
00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:35.550
have always been a volunteer force,

54
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.880
and today all the military in the u s is all volunteers.

55
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.640
You're still free thinking individuals.
They're people,

56
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.980
they're humans and you have to lead them.

57
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.030
But what's interesting is when you look at the leadership principles used to

58
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.970
effectively lead troops today,

59
00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:03.971
it's the same leadership principles to effectively lead the draftees in Vietnam.

60
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.890
Draftees or volunteers,

61
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.920
conventional forces or special operators or civilian teams and companies in

62
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:16.701
organization,

63
00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:21.080
the fundamental leadership principles use to actually lead.

64
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.990
They do not change at their core.

65
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.630
And there's a great example of this,
and again,

66
00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:36.800
we're going back to a guy by the name of Colonel David Hackworth who wrote about

67
00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:40.340
face.
We've talked about them before in this podcast.
That book is,

68
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.610
it's actually my favorite book of any category,

69
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.140
but definitely within the realm of combat and combat leadership about face by

70
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.700
David Hackworth.
Colonel David Hackworth is at the top of my list,

71
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.590
but he actually went into even more detail about one particular episode of his

72
00:05:02.991 --> 00:05:07.730
career and that was when he took over a battalion in Vietnam that was in pretty

73
00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:08.600
rough shape

74
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.220
and he wrote about that particular experience in more detail in a book called

75
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:18.890
the steel my soldiers hearts.

76
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.240
Right.
It is about the,

77
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.590
the subtitle is the hopeless to hardcore transformation of U s army.

78
00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:34.130
Fourth Battalion,
39th infantry in Vietnam.

79
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.270
<v 0>Then let's go ahead and jump on in.</v>

81
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.990
<v 0>Three times before 1969 I had made the same 18 hour trip across the Pacific to</v>

83
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.870
Southeast Asia and nothing had changed.

84
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.230
The plane was full of fngs fucking new guys,

85
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.700
19 and 20 year olds,
pink chick,
cheeked,
dry mouth,

86
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.820
wide eyed,
eager but scared.

87
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.470
One more load of fresh meat for the Vietnam Grinder.

88
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.190
I couldn't help wondering which one of them,

89
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.320
the Kiaa travel bureau would be bagging up for their return trip home.

90
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.080
Even the lucky ones,

91
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.610
the ones who made it out alive would never be the same.

92
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.150
<v 0>And he talks about arriving.</v>

94
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:39.620
So it gets to Vietnam and he talks about arriving in in in the headquarters guy

95
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.420
named general Ewells headquarters,

96
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.870
and you've heard me talk about this before about how some of the bases on Iraq

97
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:49.220
there were really,
really nice.
All built up.
They had Starbucks on them,

98
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:52.040
they had swimming pools,
they had nice gyms,
they had movie theaters.

99
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

100
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.080
<v 0>On basis in Iraq.
I know it sounds crazy for people that didn't go there,</v>

101
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.580
but that's what America does.
We have awesome logistics.
We have awesome support.

102
00:07:02.581 --> 00:07:06.090
We have a really well funded,
and you know what?

103
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.450
We're going to build a big base over there.
We're going to make it pretty nice.

104
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.430
Hey,

105
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.430
it's the same thing here that Hackworth rolls into an in Vietnam and here we go.

106
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.243
Back to the book.

107
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.030
I walked off the pad and jumped into a jeep with a kid behind its wheel waiting

108
00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:25.740
to run me over to general you'lls headquarters.
The ride was an eye opener,

109
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.280
nearly 10,000 rear echelon mother fuckers ramps to the grunts out on the line.

110
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.830
We're stationed in Dong Tam surrounded by all the creature comforts.

111
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.610
I saw a miniature golf course and a swimming pool.

112
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.680
I caught a glimpse inside of barracks decked out with clean beds under mosquito

113
00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:47.514
nets.

114
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.140
These guys pulled down the same combat pay as the soldiers and the Bush who

115
00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:54.740
lived in the mud,
washed their feet,
rot,

116
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.280
burning leaches out of their crotches and laying down their lives.

117
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.300
So that's a common term is Renfe comes from Vietnam.
Irrational on mother Fucker,

118
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:11.301
obviously Lafe and I named our business echelon front because we want it to be

119
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.660
that we want to be perfectly here and everybody that we were not talking about

120
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.720
leadership from the rear,
right?
What you're talking about,

121
00:08:18.721 --> 00:08:19.800
leadership from the front.

122
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.860
So Hackworth goes and he spends a half an hour with a general Ewell and he kinda

123
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.300
gets told what's what.

124
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.990
And then he kind of gives his assessment of what he's heard.
He says,

125
00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:31.890
pragmatically,

126
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.340
I could do nothing about the chain of command and the tactical operational

127
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:37.020
stupidity of Dong Tam.

128
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.410
I'd be out of fuels and Hans eyesight soon enough and worrying about how to con

129
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.380
how combat operations were being handled from above was a waste of time.

130
00:08:46.381 --> 00:08:49.110
At best and got men killed at worst.

131
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.140
There be ways around that.

132
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.960
The reason I highlighted that is cause a lot of times I get asked questions
from,

133
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.470
from troopers out there that say,
hey,
you know I got this issue with my boss.

134
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.850
My boss is doing this,
my boss is doing that.
This is what I try and tell them,

135
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.250
look,
it doesn't really matter.

136
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.210
Do you know you got to get out there in the field and you make some space and

137
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:15.780
then you execute how you execute.
You know,
I'm not saying you've got to disobey,

138
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.130
but people can't control you and as long as you're accomplishing the mission,

139
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.920
you're finding the best way to do it,
you're going to be fine.

140
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.600
So don't get all caught up in exactly what the boss is saying.

141
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.390
Let's figure out what the spirit of what the boss is saying.

142
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.100
Let's see what they want to get accomplished.

143
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.280
And then you go out and make it happen because no boss should be telling you

144
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:39.570
something that's completely out of sync with what your goals are.

145
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:42.390
I mean damn sure in the military you shouldn't be getting told something like,

146
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.190
Hey,
get your guys killed or give up sensitive information or lose the war.

147
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:48.300
No one's going to tell you to do that.

148
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:49.910
They're going to tell you to keep your guy's alive.

149
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.810
You're going to tell you to make progress on the battlefield.

150
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:54.870
So when you get that sort of,
when you,

151
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.010
when you pull that commander's intent out of people and you know what it is that

152
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:02.190
they want you to accomplish,
go forward and accomplish it,

153
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.820
don't get all caught up in the little details that you might not agree with.

154
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.540
They're not going to make that big of a difference out there.

155
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.173
<v 2>Now,</v>

156
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.710
<v 0>as I,
as I said this,</v>

157
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:20.400
this book is actually about the transformation of the fourth battalion,

158
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:24.000
39th infantry.
So he,
he's flying out and he talked about this,
about in,

159
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:25.980
about facing,
we actually covered on the podcast.

160
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.960
This is a little bit more detail.
So it,
I find it,
I find it to be more,
uh,

161
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.670
cover some details that's needed,

162
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.890
but he's flying out to this battalion,
which really was having a hard time.

163
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.770
And the guy brought him in,

164
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:44.610
the general broad him in because they knew that that Hackworth was a hard ass

165
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.560
and that he was a good performer,
that he,

166
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:49.530
if anyone could get this battalion turned around,
it would be him.

167
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:50.520
So they brought him out there.

168
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.400
So now he flies out and this is his first impression of the base where he's

169
00:10:56.401 --> 00:11:01.170
heading.
When I landed,
I couldn't believe my eyes or nose.

170
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.330
The whole base smelled of raw shit and rotting morale.
Toilet paper,

171
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:08.850
blue across the chopper pad,
machine gun.

172
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:13.020
The ammo was buried in the mud and troops wandered around like zombies.

173
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.480
They're weapons gone red with rust.

174
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.340
These were the sloppiest American soldiers I'd ever seen a bar,

175
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:25.341
none on camped on washed unshaven their uniforms,

176
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:29.970
ragged and dirty hippy beads dangling alongside their dog tags,

177
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.920
their helmets covered with graffiti,

178
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.700
not exactly what you're looking for in a good squared away military
organization.

179
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

180
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.230
<v 0>Now one of the guys that he brings in,</v>

181
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.220
he brings in one of his guys to be the senior enlisted there to be as his

182
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.480
command sergeant major.
And it's a guy named Robert Press.

183
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.720
And here's what he says about,
about Robert Press.

184
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.190
We'd also served together in the states as well as in Vietnam and our

185
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:03.220
partnership went all the way back to the same unit during Korea.

186
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.330
Lean and mean press would be my new battalion sergeant major,

187
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.290
that non coms chief ass kicker and new role model.

188
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.910
You get it,
you get a good impression of what that guy's like.
This is a,

189
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.580
this is a gunny highway scenario

190
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.070
and here's what press had to say about the local,
about,

191
00:12:25.071 --> 00:12:27.800
about the troops I is,
this is from pressing,

192
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.090
I looked around and seen no one wearing helmets,
no one caring their weapons.

193
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.710
Everybody in the CP,
that's a command post group was sleeping above ground.

194
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.770
Sleeping above ground means if they get bombed,
they're going to get killed.

195
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.890
I didn't see a Fox foxhole anywhere,
sir.

196
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.350
This outfit stinks worse than we thought.

197
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:48.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

198
00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.620
<v 0>So that's their first impression going into this obviously bad,</v>

199
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.480
bad situation

200
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.340
getting these are draftees and it's even,
I got to keep reminding me,

201
00:12:58.341 --> 00:12:59.480
sell myself that too,

202
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.560
because the whole time I was in the military is an all volunteer military and

203
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:05.610
sure you get some slackers and some knuckleheads,

204
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.540
but at least people had volunteered at some point to be there.

205
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.390
These people are being pulled against their will.
I mean,
I think you're a better,

206
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.900
better example of this than me.
Echo,
Echo.
Imagine when you were 18 years old,

207
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.160
I mean,
when I was 18 years old,
I was already signed up.
I was Ian.

208
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.340
Imagine when you were 18 years old and them coming at you.

209
00:13:25.341 --> 00:13:28.220
Where were you when you were 18 in the University of Hawaii?
Yes.

210
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.680
Playing football.
Yes.
Now what if they came to you and said,
hey,
echo.
Got It.

211
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.260
Do you have to go in the military?
You're going to Vietnam?
How,

212
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.750
how would you feel about that?
Yeah,
no.
Yeah,
it'd be rough.
Yeah,
and,

213
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.400
and you as a discipline,
football player,
that's an athlete,

214
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.420
you are going to be 10 steps above someone.
That's,
you know,

215
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.850
out on the streets of,
you know,
Haight Ashbury smoking dope.
Yeah.

216
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.190
But that's who these people were.
It's a cross section of America.

217
00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.220
So sure you would get some kids that were getting drafted from Iowa,

218
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.320
a farm kid that's like,
hey,
it's my turn to fight.
I'm going to go do it.

219
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.320
And then you're going to get,
you know,
you're gonna get every cross section.

220
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.423
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

221
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.590
<v 0>So worth when you just don't want to be there.
Then every word out of it,</v>

222
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.680
like someone telling you what to do or something that you know that you got to

223
00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:22.820
go do everything.
Every little thing.
Yes.
And you can't have that attitude.

224
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.871
You have to shift that.

225
00:14:23.871 --> 00:14:26.600
Like when I went through officer candidate school officer candidate school is

226
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:29.960
like bootcamp,
but it's a little longer.
And I had already been in the,

227
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.870
in the military for eight years when I went to officer candidate school.

228
00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:33.201
And you know,

229
00:14:33.201 --> 00:14:37.040
they're yelling at me about the way my underwears folded and yelling at me about

230
00:14:37.041 --> 00:14:41.180
looking at my food when I'm eating and yelling at me about my,
about my socks,

231
00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:42.530
not be enrolled upright.

232
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:47.830
So I'm a grown man then in the seal teams for like eight years this point and

233
00:14:47.871 --> 00:14:51.110
this happened and you know what I did loved it,
said,
Oh really?

234
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.680
My underwears not measured four by four inches when it's folded up,

235
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:58.160
I will correct that now and make it four by four inches because deep down could

236
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:00.380
you kind of recognize the value that this is,

237
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.800
this is somehow valuable in my goal.
But man,

238
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:06.470
if you're there against your will and they're like do this or whatever,

239
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.160
I don't even want to be you also let you like I made it into a game,
right?

240
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:16.070
I made it into a game that I played with my full intention of winning.
You know,

241
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.113
for instance,

242
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.800
they make you yell everything at officer candidate school you have to yell every

243
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:24.980
word that you say with the Joel instructors or where your friends or whoever,

244
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:27.860
we are not your friends,
but with the other candidates we had to yell everything.

245
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.600
They call it a ballistic tone.

246
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.610
And so I made everyone yell one cause I was the class president.

247
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.500
I made everybody yell 100% of the time.
So,
for instance,

248
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:44.210
the upperclassmen had a little closet that they would sell food out of,

249
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.630
you know,
candy bars and sodas.
Right.

250
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:53.030
And we had to line up if we wanted to buy something.
So I told all my people,

251
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.820
you know,
you,
when you go in there,
you met,

252
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:59.120
you maintain your ballistic voice at all times.
So they're there.

253
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.410
So my whole class lines up and they're going in and everyone is yelling at the

254
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:08.060
top of their lungs.
Like I will take one coca cola and one snickers bar,

255
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:08.894
please star.

256
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.360
And it took about 10 people going through and finally the upperclassmen came out

257
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.020
and they said,
hey you guys,
when you come in here,
don't be ballistic.

258
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.220
And of course I said request permission to speak.

259
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.930
You guys are not maintaining the standard of officer candidate school.

260
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.620
We are supposed to maintain ballistic tone at all times.

261
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.060
And they just were looking at me like they wanted to kill me but they couldn't

262
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:36.680
say anything because I was correct.

263
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.180
So that's the kind of thing [inaudible] that was a victory for my class,

264
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:42.620
you know,
cause that was the upperclassmen.

265
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.580
I was like a cool victory for the class and everyone was all laughing at and

266
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:47.510
fired up.
You know,

267
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:52.511
like we're going to be so perfect that people are going to get angry with us.

268
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.670
So that,
that's what I did.
Uh,
now going back to the book here,

269
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.390
he kicks this one off.
This is directly out of about phase two there.

270
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.900
And it's also,
well this one says there are no bad troops,

271
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:09.240
just bad officers in the,

272
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.300
in the book extreme ownership by Lafe and I,

273
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:14.630
we have a little chapter in there called no bad teams,
only bad leaders.

274
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.640
So it's the same thing.
And that axiom goes back to Napoleon who said,

275
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.330
you know,
no bad regimens,
only bad kernels or something along those lines.

276
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.030
So then he talks a little bit about the guy who was previously in command,

277
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.650
a guy by the name of Colonel Lark and that's a pseudonym.
So,
but here we go.

278
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.260
After six months under Colonel Lark,

279
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.290
the four 39th had suffered the equivalent of nearly 40% casualties without ever

280
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.690
meeting a significant enemy force in open combat rockets,

281
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:52.020
mortars,
booby traps,
friendly fire had done most of the damage.

282
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.843
<v 2>That's</v>

283
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.800
<v 0>same thing in Iraq.
That's what most people were facing in Iraq.
Rockers,
rockets,</v>

284
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:05.040
mortars,
booby traps,
which is ids friendly fire.

285
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.290
That's where you're getting most of your casualties from.
Of course,

286
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:10.350
in Iraq it was mostly iads,
but then mortars,
rockets,

287
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:12.270
and then you get your gun fights.
I don't,
you know,

288
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:16.170
blue on blue definitely makes up a section,
not a huge section

289
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:23.090
and of course obviously it's something that we experienced back to the book

290
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:24.480
here.

291
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.340
All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.

292
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.790
Sun Tzu wrote over 2,500 years ago.

293
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.390
Low ground is not only damp and unhealthy,

294
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.480
but also disadvantages for fighting.

295
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.900
If you are careful of your men and camp on hard ground,

296
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:45.990
your army will be free from disease of every con,
every kind,

297
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.970
and this will spelled victory.

298
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.680
I don't think General Westmoreland or the u s commanders running the warm

299
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.390
Vietnam New Sun Su from Sonny and Cher.

300
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.250
Then here he talks about what the damaging effects were of being in the low

301
00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:07.160
ground in just 48 hours and soaking jungle boots,

302
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:12.220
foot rot set in mosquito zap them with malaria leeches sucked onto their balls

303
00:19:12.981 --> 00:19:17.981
and even up Dick's and morale vaporize before Charlie fired one shot.

304
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.310
Luckily we've covered sown sue on here,
so no,

305
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.370
nobody that's listen to the podcast is ever going to be out there.

306
00:19:25.371 --> 00:19:29.660
Thinking of without thinking about the basic principles that sun suit taught,

307
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.940
most of the four 39 soldiers knew that each time they took a step,

308
00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:39.030
they risked the ugliest of wounds.
A bullet makes a hole.

309
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.870
A chunk of shrapnel may take off an arm,

310
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.320
but a mind turns a soldier into a splattered shrapnel punctured basket case.

311
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.940
Many troopers in the battalion had concluded that waging war consistent of

312
00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:57.650
crossing a field,
hitting a mind,
calling for a medic,
patching up the wounded,

313
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.760
getting a medivac,
then moving out again and hating another mine.

314
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.320
They also did the math and figured out that not many of them would be lucky

315
00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:10.220
enough to make it through 365 days it took to rotate home.

316
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.240
It's a horrible view of war.
You don't,
we're going to do,

317
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.580
we're going to walk around in the Bush until we hit a mine.

318
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.870
Some of us are going to get blown up.

319
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:21.240
We're going to call it a matter of Akron and get 'em out of there the best we

320
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:23.760
can if they're not dead and then we're going to keep walking until it happens

321
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:28.290
again.
Back to the book,
the wounds were vicious.

322
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.270
Young men,
blinded legs and arms and dicks and balls ripped off.

323
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.680
Bodies,
punctured with dozens of bleeding holes for the VC.

324
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.450
Mines and booby traps were economy of force weapons,
easy to deploy,

325
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.740
cheap to produce besides causing heavy casualties.

326
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.660
They presume produced a lot of psychological stress.

327
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.670
Soldiers never knew when they would lose a foot,

328
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:58.950
a leg or a life and the frustrating part was there were a few ways to fight back

329
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.240
cause who are you going to fight against?
The bomb goes off.
There's no one there.

330
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.660
It's it's,
it's a victim activated IED,

331
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:16.090
which means you stepped on a pressure plate.
Oh,
you pulled the trip wire,

332
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.570
something that you did,
made it blow up.
There's no one,

333
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.500
there's no one to fight against.
No one to shoot.
Back at

334
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.310
the tally of back to the book,

335
00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:29.311
the tally of needless death in the four 39th was a well established before

336
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:34.300
Colonel Lark took command,
larks immediate predecessor,

337
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.330
a gung Ho lieutenant colonel drove the troops like endured indentured servants.

338
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.520
One Steamy Day,
a company working it's way across the rice.

339
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:49.420
Patty was plotting through several feet of water and muck while overhead in the

340
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:53.710
command and control chopper.
The colonel kept screaming faster,
go faster.

341
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.960
It was never going to happen.

342
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:59.470
The troops were already moving at Max speed in a lather.

343
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.020
The colonel landed jumping out of his Birdie,

344
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.470
spread to a patty dyke and then leapt on top of it to make his point.

345
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.860
A Supreme Mekong Delta.
No,
no.

346
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:14.380
And when the almost instantaneous explosion blew him 20 feet in the air and he

347
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:18.220
died immediately.
It needlessly the ultimate ego trip.

348
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.160
I was told the grunts cheered.

349
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.890
So the reason I highlighted that is because when we start talking about

350
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.980
Hackworth and what he does,
you're going to see that he's going to like you.

351
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.840
The terms he uses here is a gung Ho lieutenant drove the troops,

352
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.580
right?
You're gonna hear,
you're gonna hear Hackworth doing the same thing.

353
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:44.650
But there's a difference in the way that he does it.

354
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.200
He understands what he's doing.

355
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:52.390
He's not just doing it out of ego and not oppressing the guys for no particular

356
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:56.950
reason.
And then the other side of the spectrum,

357
00:22:56.951 --> 00:23:00.040
you get this Guy Lark.
When lark took command,

358
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.730
he knew that he had to turn things around and he worked hard to do so.

359
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.210
But with zero combat experience and not enough time with the troops,

360
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:09.700
has good intentions,
meant less than nothing.

361
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.460
Even the basics were ignored.

362
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.020
He wore an army green baseball cap instead of a steel pot.

363
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.400
Really Cool,

364
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.110
except that the troops who followed his model and neglected their helmets wound

365
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:27.460
up in doc Holly surgery with their brain's running down their necks.

366
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.590
He was,
uh,
he was into good guy.
Fraternizing to build morale,

367
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.390
a well intentioned notion,
but it made for bad news in the field.

368
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.070
So you see the two extremes.

369
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.830
You get the super hardcore guy that's just a maniac pushing hard.

370
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:48.650
You must do what I say.
And then you,
then the next guy comes in,

371
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:52.820
he's on the other end of the spectrum.
Hey,
I'm everybody's buddy.
Let's,
you know,

372
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:55.970
don't worry about wearing a helmet.
Hey,
I know,
I know that things uncomfortable.

373
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.913
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

374
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.300
<v 0>LARC sent his a company on a three day sweep of a woodline completely empty of</v>

375
00:24:06.091 --> 00:24:06.924
VC,

376
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.880
but a Ho Ci Minh wet dream of booby traps and minds.

377
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.810
That was the day sergeant Tom Aiken lost 17 of the 29 in his platoon without

378
00:24:19.831 --> 00:24:21.390
hearing a single shot.

379
00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.340
All we were doing was tripping booby traps.

380
00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:29.740
He recalls his voice trembling slightly.

381
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.170
There wasn't any me and there wasn't any enemy in there,
no books at all.

382
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.820
We knew it.
But Colonel Lark kept saying,
sweep the woodline,

383
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:44.830
sweep the look Woodbine
more than 30 years later,

384
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.940
a can made a list of the men in his platoon killed under LARCs command.

385
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.810
When he finished writing it,
his wife asked him,

386
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.200
how could you remember all those names after all these years?

387
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.750
His answer was simple.
How could I forget them?

388
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.020
Now here's another incident that takes place just before Hackworth arrives and

389
00:25:16.021 --> 00:25:20.820
takes over.
The VC had planted in an American,

390
00:25:20.821 --> 00:25:23.700
made claymore mine alongside the road.

391
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.020
The world blew up suddenly in smoke and fire.

392
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:32.250
Evan's recalls in doc platoon medic.
That's another book.

393
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.120
His blood and guts memoir of life with the Ford 39th a wall of superstar Anik

394
00:25:39.661 --> 00:25:44.661
steel balls blasted the passengers shredding metal and flesh from the Bush

395
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:51.350
rockets squished down lifting the jeep and trailer up into an expanding fireball

396
00:25:52.261 --> 00:25:55.200
that tossed mangled soldiers all over the road.

397
00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:01.440
Automatic gunfire stitched every square foot of the road.

398
00:26:01.441 --> 00:26:04.230
As those few gis still able to make,

399
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.710
made a run for an adjacent Waterfield ditch.

400
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.260
Those left behind screamed and wailed and cried out.

401
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.280
They crawled and pulled themselves around in the middle of the road,

402
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.940
like crushed bugs with limbs and pieces of their bodies missing.

403
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:27.360
Teddy Creech used his elbows to claw his way across the road like a mangled,

404
00:26:27.361 --> 00:26:31.590
warm.
His hands were mutilated beyond recognition.

405
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.020
His leg had been severed from the hip except for a tether of bloody skin and

406
00:26:37.021 --> 00:26:37.854
flesh.

407
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.060
The jagged end of the detached bone kept digging into the road and him in place.

408
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:51.050
He fumbled out his knife and in the way that a trapped animal will NOFX his own

409
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:52.680
foot in order to escape,

410
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.520
cut himself free of his own leg.

411
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:05.110
Richard Forte lay with a bullet hole in his belly is bloated.

412
00:27:05.111 --> 00:27:10.111
Guts signaled heavy internal bleeding he's faced was the color of old ivory.

413
00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.940
And that's something I've seen before where someone's gut shot and there's not a

414
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:16.210
lot of blood coming out of them,

415
00:27:16.211 --> 00:27:19.450
but you can see there their stomach starts to fill up cause they're internally

416
00:27:19.451 --> 00:27:21.970
bleeding and they turned super pale cause it's like they're bleeding out,

417
00:27:21.971 --> 00:27:25.210
but there's bleeding inside of their own stomach and it's really obvious what's

418
00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:29.720
happening to them
back to the book.
It's all right.

419
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:34.130
I'm okay doc.
He groaned,
doc.
The others,

420
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.580
they need you.
Go help my buddies.
Doc,

421
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.930
where did the army gets such men?
Evan's wondered,

422
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.790
thinking of over others when they themselves were dying

423
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.210
and what did they get in return?
The VC picked us off one by one.

424
00:27:53.211 --> 00:27:58.211
He recalls one by one day after day before 39th was helpless and demoralized

425
00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:05.711
against a superior army of ghosts that could do to us what it wished.

426
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.560
So that's the situation that the four 39th was in

427
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.630
just an absolute disaster.

428
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.830
And you can you imagine what the morale is like day after day.
You're going out,

429
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.080
as we just said,
going out,

430
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.930
walking through the Bush just in order to get blown up.

431
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.493
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

432
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:39.310
<v 0>So that is when Hackworth comes in to take over.</v>

433
00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:43.790
And here's the,
here's the situation.

434
00:28:43.791 --> 00:28:44.990
When he comes to take command,

435
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.800
a scraggly bunch of battalion soldiers assembled for the change of command

436
00:28:50.801 --> 00:28:54.100
ceremony on disciplined and dispirited,

437
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.170
wondering what was going to happen to them next.

438
00:28:56.171 --> 00:29:00.610
They stood like characters in a police lineup where every participant was a perp

439
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.110
with silver blades gleaming in the sun,
a flock of brightly Simonides,

440
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.700
Hueys dropped from the skies over.
Dizzy.

441
00:29:09.701 --> 00:29:14.230
Dizzy is the the area where they're staying.
One by one,

442
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.100
starched army brass with an entourage of photographers.

443
00:29:18.101 --> 00:29:22.330
Strutted across the Lz.
General Ewell leading the way.

444
00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.330
Their fatigues pressed their sleeves precisely rolled up above their elbows into

445
00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.480
four-inch folds,

446
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.600
their shoes polished to per grade ground perfection to the grunts.

447
00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:37.630
They must have looked like aliens from outer space.

448
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.630
I stood soldier straight and watched those from on high pay.

449
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:47.170
Absolutely no attention to the assembled troops,

450
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:52.180
the men from their battalion,
their division for them,

451
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.940
the boys on the line.
We're beside the point,

452
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.160
more pawns to be ignored.
It disgusted me

453
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.090
in the ninth division.

454
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:07.790
That gap between the brass and the grunts looked unbridgeable.

455
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:10.863
<v 2>Okay,</v>

456
00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.030
<v 0>so if you remember,
Hackworth was a grunt.</v>

457
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.220
He came as an enlisted guy.

458
00:30:16.221 --> 00:30:21.050
He was a junior RMP person and he came up through the ranks.

459
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.700
So when he sees this behavior of these senior leaders,

460
00:30:25.701 --> 00:30:29.330
which he already knows that they're back with miniature golf courses and pools

461
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.840
that now he sees him show up there and their starched cammies,

462
00:30:32.841 --> 00:30:37.790
they're looking all perfect and they don't even pay attention to these troopers.

463
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.600
Even if they were to say,
look,
you guys look like crap.
What is wrong with you?

464
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.580
Get it together.
Even if they were to say that,

465
00:30:43.581 --> 00:30:48.080
at least it be it'd be recognition.
Yeah.
What did just ignored them.

466
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.530
So he takes over and he says,
time for shock therapy

467
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.770
as I as planned,

468
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:06.830
I fired the incompetent s three that's the operations officer and the heavy drop

469
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:12.180
battalion sergeant on the spot and replace them with Bumstead and press those.

470
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.920
One of the guys I talked about earlier,
press and bumps that one of Hackworth,

471
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.000
other kind of prodigies,

472
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.060
thousand other changes needed to be made,

473
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:25.590
but I didn't want to bury the company commanders or our staff on the first day

474
00:31:25.591 --> 00:31:29.640
together.
If I ordered all shortcomings squared away,

475
00:31:29.641 --> 00:31:32.790
immediately I'd have sent these leaders into overload,

476
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.960
blown all their circuits.
No one would have gotten to anything.
Right.

477
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.400
So I approached this conversation from slackness to soldiering the same way I

478
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.950
train a pop.
Just a few tricks at a time.

479
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

480
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.830
<v 0>Starting now,
starting now,</v>

481
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:50.980
we're going to follow the two rule plan.
I said,

482
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.910
I'll tell you what the two new rules are and you make them happen.

483
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.460
Once your troops have mastered the first two rules,

484
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.270
we'll add two more and we'll keep doing that until we're squared away.

485
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.050
First we'll crawl,
then we'll walk and then we'll run.

486
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:10.530
Just stay with me because we're going to run faster and faster every day they

487
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:13.420
shot me approve it.
Look.

488
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.660
<v 2>Okay,</v>

489
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.410
<v 0>so you can see hack.
He's going into a little prioritize and execute,
right?</v>

490
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:21.780
He knows that people can't do,
he's not going to change everything immediately.

491
00:32:21.781 --> 00:32:24.690
He's got to do it and some steps,
hey,
that's the same thing you do with any,

492
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.780
any situation that you face.
You got multiple problems that are,

493
00:32:27.781 --> 00:32:30.480
that you're looking at.
You can't or you can't change them all at once.

494
00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:32.560
You can't fix them all at once.
You pick the biggest problems.

495
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.480
You start with those.

496
00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.170
And here he's starting to establish and his men and his and his leadership team

497
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.650
as to what their attitude was with the troops.

498
00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:49.520
A few days later after finding a very small soldier who told me his feet were

499
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:53.180
killing him because he couldn't get any boots to fit him,
they were all too big.

500
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.710
I had a little conversation with the good s four s four as the supply elements,

501
00:32:57.711 --> 00:33:02.120
uh,
uh,
in the military,
in the army.
Hack went ballistic.

502
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.350
Johnson recalls.

503
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.680
He chewed out his chain of command from his squad leader to his company

504
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:08.540
commander,
and then he got a hold of me.

505
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.280
He made it very clear that I better get that man a pair of boots or all kinds of

506
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:14.960
horrible things were going to happen to me.

507
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.920
The army did not make a men's boot small enough to fit this little guy.

508
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.640
We scavenged the country and found a pair of women's boots that fit the bill.

509
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.280
This taught us all an important lesson.

510
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.350
That hack cared for the lowest of soldiers and he expected his commanders and

511
00:33:30.351 --> 00:33:32.540
staff to damn well look after them.

512
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.800
This is how hack goes on a campaign to change people.

513
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.140
The little things build up.

514
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.140
Now he's continuing.
You starting to tighten things up more.

515
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.640
I finished my first session with a set of orders that stunned the commanders.

516
00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.990
Here's the drill.
I told him,
we're shrinking the perimeter tonight.

517
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.070
I want you to recon your new positions.
When it gets dark,

518
00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.750
each company will pull back.

519
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:10.010
You'll maintain your old positions with half your force and by midnight.

520
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:14.360
I want those holes filled in.
I want nothing left that the enemy can use,

521
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:16.760
particularly holes at the VC can hop into.

522
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:21.761
If they attack all your people will be at 100% stand to ready to fight in the

523
00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:26.750
new positions by midnight.
I expect total light and noise disciplined.

524
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:32.120
Remember,
nothing happens other than reconning until after dark.

525
00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:34.010
You've got,

526
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.250
you've got to always remember that the enemies out there in the Bush watching

527
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:42.110
our every move and he's always looking for a weak spot to knock your cock stiff

528
00:34:42.111 --> 00:34:43.520
and closed down the show.

529
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.070
You call me at midnight from the new positions.
Midnight understood.

530
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.100
The commanders went out to brief their troops.

531
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.950
My orders went down like an iron kite.

532
00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.940
Preparing a fighting position is hard,
sweaty work.

533
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.300
Moving a fighting position is even more of a bitch because you have to fill in

534
00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:06.740
the old hole before digging in again.
It sucks in any circumstances.

535
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.370
They hated my guts
and now he does.

536
00:35:13.371 --> 00:35:16.820
The same thing with is with the,
with the leadership element,

537
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.470
which works in the,
what's called the Toc,
the tactical operations center.
He says,

538
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.270
and all the talk personnel,

539
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.380
regardless of rank or ordered a dig in individual foxholes around it,

540
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.380
they'd lived there when not on duty.

541
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.650
My Tok order had a two fold purpose.

542
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.320
Having a bunkered command post made it much harder for Charlie to take out the

543
00:35:37.321 --> 00:35:41.370
battalion ops center with a one well directed round,
which were markedly,

544
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.140
he hadn't already done.

545
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:48.450
And if Charlie hammered the battalion with incoming fire or penetrated our outer

546
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:50.850
line,
we'd have an inner perimeter of staff.

547
00:35:50.851 --> 00:35:54.300
We need to hold off the enemy while we fought the good fight and calling

548
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:55.380
supporting fires.

549
00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:01.220
Plus the staff would be setting a positive example for all of the line soldiers.

550
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.470
We'd live exactly like the grunts.

551
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.610
We'd sleep on the ground like stonewall Jackson did during the civil war.

552
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:14.190
No one would have a plush deal anymore.
Common theme,

553
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:15.300
we've heard that one before.

554
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.360
Then that night,
so after they pull their perimeter back and they've changed,

555
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.410
basically changed their positions to what the enemy saw during the day.

556
00:36:26.411 --> 00:36:29.110
During the day,
the enemy star where they were once the,
once it got dark,

557
00:36:29.111 --> 00:36:32.140
they moved to new positions.
They dug and they filled in their old holes.

558
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:36.460
Night comes and guess what?
They get attacked.
Mortar rounds.

559
00:36:36.461 --> 00:36:41.310
Recoilless rifle,
rifle,
fire machine gun fire and RPG rounds,

560
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:46.210
screamed in,
Chum Roberts or calls.
Then all hell broke loose strobe lights.

561
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.780
They just become an sop at Hax commander's meeting that afternoon,

562
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.470
flipped on around the perimeter.
The VC were hitting us hard,

563
00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.560
but we were ready now.
Wow.
I thought,

564
00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.500
stay close to this guy and you'll be all right.

565
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.140
Hit another guy.

566
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.750
That hack overheard as they're getting this attack and they survive it and they

567
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.600
do well.
No one gets injured.

568
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.100
He hears a guy say he's a mean son of a bitch,
but he knows what he's doing.

569
00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.800
Getting this is part of the campaign.

570
00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:19.180
<v 2>Okay,</v>

571
00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.110
<v 0>dawn,
back to the book.
Dawn was breaking and press walked the perimeter.</v>

572
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.430
Sir,
some of the troops are saying that you have your shit together.

573
00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.450
He reported they're talking about how you pulled them back.

574
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.270
Maybe I'd made a few converts that night,

575
00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.230
but I knew I was a long way from convincing the grunts that they could hit

576
00:37:38.231 --> 00:37:40.300
Charlie harder than he was hitting them.

577
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:41.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

578
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:45.520
<v 0>Over the next four weeks,
I talked to every swinging Dick in the battalion.</v>

579
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.280
I told all the soldiers,
all the sergeants,

580
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:51.220
all the lieutenants and captains in each platoon and company,

581
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:55.240
what was expected of them and why we were going to be the best.

582
00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:59.980
So,
so just to reiterate what he just did,

583
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:05.200
he's going around in personally talking to all the leadership and all the

584
00:38:05.201 --> 00:38:05.650
soldiers,

585
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:09.790
everyone personally talking to the mall and telling them what was expected of

586
00:38:09.791 --> 00:38:12.790
them and why they were going to be the best.

587
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.140
This stuff just doesn't happen.

588
00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.740
You have to make it happen when you're in a leadership position.

589
00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.410
Back to the bucket.
When I spoke to the troops,

590
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.100
I promised I'd take care of their butts and be right out there with them.

591
00:38:27.101 --> 00:38:28.210
When things got hot,

592
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.220
I wanted to get into their heads that by stealing a page from the enemy's book,

593
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:37.390
we could take the war to Charlie rather than waiting for him to strike.

594
00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

595
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.040
<v 0>Now he talks a little bit about the VC.</v>

596
00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:45.980
He says the VC were very detailed planners,

597
00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:50.600
but strict adherence to their plan was also their Achilles heel.

598
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:55.940
They almost always stuck to this scenario even when things turned to shit,

599
00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.520
so that's great.
You're a good planner.
That's great.

600
00:39:01.521 --> 00:39:03.200
You came up with a really solid plan,

601
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:07.010
but when things start going sideways and you maintain that and plan,

602
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.560
you don't make any adaptations,

603
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.920
you're going to get crushed and that was he saying the vcs biggest weakness.

604
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.813
Weakness.

605
00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.720
I also had all our,

606
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.900
all our leaders read a pamphlet of combat rules and tips from articles I'd

607
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.110
written that I put together as the battalion combat leaders guide.

608
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.690
I wanted them to get in their heads,

609
00:39:30.691 --> 00:39:35.490
both how Charlie fought and an end thought and how I fought and fought.

610
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.290
I wanted to build an offensive team to make Charlie react to us instead of

611
00:39:40.291 --> 00:39:42.930
calling the shots as he was doing all over Vietnam.

612
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:48.710
I stressed how we'd find him by being hardcore and agile using stealth and

613
00:39:49.651 --> 00:39:52.920
Connie and how we could turn his very own tactics against him.

614
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:56.870
<v 1>Then that's,
I</v>

615
00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.360
<v 0>breezed over this,
but the other things that he had,</v>

616
00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:05.590
all this people read was Mao's little red book,
which was the,

617
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:10.630
the communist sort of manifesto about fighting and then Vietnam Primer,

618
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:15.820
which is another book that Hackworth put together so he'd have everybody.
He was,

619
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:20.170
he was educating the troops.
He was educating the leadership,

620
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.980
not just on how he was going to do things,
but I don't have the enemy thought,

621
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:25.003
<v 1>hmm,</v>

622
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.190
<v 0>and this is a rehash from about face,
but let's just go ahead and rehash it.</v>

623
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:37.830
I brought back saluting a sign of military discipline that had been swallowed up

624
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.260
by the rice patty mud.

625
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.130
Then I added a twist when a soldier saluted.

626
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.150
I required him to sound off with a loud,
hardcore Reccondo sir,

627
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.410
to which the officer would reply,
no fucking slack.

628
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.870
The salute discipline aside also built unit pride.

629
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.190
The name Rick Condo,
a combination of reconnaissance and infantry.

630
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:05.060
Doughboy came from the rugged hands on training.

631
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:09.870
The hundred and first Airborne Division practiced at Fort Campbell training

632
00:41:09.871 --> 00:41:13.020
modeled after the British commando and American ranger courses.

633
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.960
Hank Emerson had named the First Brigade,

634
00:41:15.961 --> 00:41:20.520
the RUC Condo Brigade to make the unit feel elite like an airborne outfit.

635
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.860
Hitchhiking on this idea,

636
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.730
I named the four 39th the hardcore raw condos.

637
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:32.270
Bob Press hired a machine shop in Saigon to make small black metal ricondo

638
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.110
arrowhead pins,
which the men quickly began wearing.

639
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:41.300
We painted the rock condo insignia on the sides of our helmets and on all of our

640
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:45.980
vehicles just below the windshield,
along with a large white hardcore.

641
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.050
We painted the same insignia on company and battalion signs at the fire bases

642
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.050
and back at our rear area in Dome Tam.

643
00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.380
We also had sharp looking hardcore Reccondo stationary printed up and gave it to

644
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:04.820
the troops and all outgoing mail was stamped with the rock condo logo.

645
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.900
All of this said,
we're different.

646
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:14.420
We're not just plain old infantry where the best hardcore raw condos.

647
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.680
We drove the point home that an infantry combat the team,

648
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.660
the squad platoon and company was the primary instrument and inspiration.

649
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.450
We stress pride in itself.

650
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:31.880
Pride in unit it never let a buddy down.

651
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:36.950
Rifle company designations were changed from the Conventional Alpha,
Bravo,

652
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:41.951
Charlie and Delta to alert battle claim more and dagger which went down his

653
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:48.401
Mickey mouse until the troops got into it again to think it was very cool.

654
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.153
<v 2>Okay,</v>

655
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.120
<v 0>well that's something that I completely</v>

656
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.670
ripped off,
emulated stole from Hackworth.

657
00:42:59.671 --> 00:43:04.671
When when I was a task unit commander and the,

658
00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:08.460
you know the,
the designations for the task units are Alpha,
Bravo,

659
00:43:08.461 --> 00:43:11.340
Charlie Delta sometimes,
sometimes delta.

660
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.030
Usually when I was in it was Alpha Bravo,
Charlie.
And so obviously I said,
ah,

661
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:19.020
we're not going to be Bravo.
We were assigned the name Bravo,

662
00:43:19.021 --> 00:43:21.570
but we immediately changed that to bruiser

663
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.150
and then we lived that way

664
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:34.250
back to the book.
Hardcore soldiers wouldn't look like bums anymore either.

665
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.640
They'd shave every day,
wear their gear properly,

666
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.760
and always be in camouflage to went on ops and the leaders made it happen by

667
00:43:43.161 --> 00:43:46.070
setting the example and being hard but fair,

668
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.270
this was all viewed as chicken shit at first.

669
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.330
And I was considered to quote doc Holly,

670
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:58.570
the original Gi Joe Lifer sent from hell the burn their hides with fire and

671
00:43:59.301 --> 00:44:03.290
brimstone.
So if you don't know this lifer,

672
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:06.260
the term lifer in the military,
especially during Vietnam,

673
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.860
you know that's the opposite of a draft.
You know,

674
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:12.350
a draftee that does just wants to do his time and get out.

675
00:44:12.351 --> 00:44:16.580
The opposite of that is a lifer.
Someone that's totally into it,

676
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:21.581
someone that's totally Gung Ho and fired up and they call him the original Gi

677
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.480
Joe Lifer
as claymore companies.

678
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:30.530
Jim Robertson put it in the February letter to his parents.

679
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.540
Our new kernel is nuts.

680
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:37.020
It would take a week to tell you all the nutty things he's done.

681
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.420
So I'll make it short line.

682
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:43.260
Companies are offering $1,600 for his dead body.

683
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:47.940
He won't last long.
He'll get zapped.
He stark raving mad.

684
00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:51.003
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

685
00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:55.720
<v 0>Nobody liked hack alert companies.
Tom Ake and recalls.</v>

686
00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.530
I remember the guys from B Company talking about we're going to kill the son of

687
00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:03.040
a bitch and we're going to put a bounty on them,
and I'm telling you the truth,

688
00:45:03.041 --> 00:45:04.510
if I've ever told it in my life,

689
00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.040
I turned around and glanced at one of them said I,
one of them,
and I said,

690
00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:11.080
I'll throw in the first $20

691
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.290
but each time they saluted,

692
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.300
they gave themselves a little subconscious commercial,

693
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:23.210
a brainwashing that they were hardcore and after awhile I knew they'd begin to

694
00:45:23.211 --> 00:45:25.550
believe they were the meanest mothers in Vietnam.

695
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.750
The men of soon to be hardcore battalion hadn't seen anything yet.

696
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.130
Threats are no threats.
I continued to issue them a d daily,

697
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.720
Basic Brown shoe,

698
00:45:35.721 --> 00:45:40.721
army ass kicking and tighten both the discipline and standards more and more of

699
00:45:41.991 --> 00:45:45.200
all the many traits needed to survive and win on the battlefield.

700
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.610
Discipline is number one without absolute disciplined,

701
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:54.010
you lose.
And these guys still had virtually none

702
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.190
in.
Again,
I got to point out that the original,

703
00:46:03.191 --> 00:46:08.191
remember the original guy that were super hardcore and trying to impose this

704
00:46:08.861 --> 00:46:12.700
discipline,
it's very similar to what hacks doing.
Very similar.

705
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.700
The difference being number one,

706
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:20.910
he cares about that guys and they just haven't seen that yet.

707
00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.980
They don't understand that the discipline that he's teaching them is going to

708
00:46:26.531 --> 00:46:30.250
keep them alive and when they recognize that mentally he knows he's got to push

709
00:46:30.251 --> 00:46:34.030
that through that point.
He's not making them do things just to make them do not,

710
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:34.840
he's not me.

711
00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.250
He's not using discipline just to be a four or a Tarion and prove that he can

712
00:46:39.251 --> 00:46:43.120
make them do it.
That's not his goal.
That's not what he's doing.
He truly is.

713
00:46:43.121 --> 00:46:47.470
He's the reason he's trying to impose discipline on them is to keep them alive

714
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:52.150
because he cares about those guys and it's going to take a little bit of time

715
00:46:52.151 --> 00:46:54.490
for them to recognize it,
but once they recognize it,

716
00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:56.230
they're going to be on board.

717
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.180
<v 1>Okay,</v>

718
00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.240
<v 0>here's what he told his a battalion leaders.</v>

719
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

720
00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.270
<v 0>The leadership inside the battalion.
If you take care of your soldiers,</v>

721
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.230
they'll take care of you.
According to battle companies,

722
00:47:12.231 --> 00:47:17.231
Lieutenant Carl Olsen and ocs grow drafty who is sharp as a Hinson custom knife.

723
00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:23.030
The rules were simple check weapons,
check feet,

724
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:27.770
show that you care and let the troops know.
If we get into deep shit,

725
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.650
help will be the way

726
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:36.540
I used every second every day to train and instill discipline beginning with

727
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:41.710
something as basic as making sure every man wore has steel pot and carried his

728
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:42.970
weapons at all times.

729
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:44.500
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

730
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.830
<v 0>we trained in the fire base.
We trained on the ambush patrol.</v>

731
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.060
We trained sweeping a large patch of jungle.
We trained searching for Charlie.

732
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:57.450
I stressed all the unit leaders that all of the drills must be executed over and

733
00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:00.490
over again until they become automatic.

734
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.990
I wanted these soldiers to roll into a firing position or take counter ambush

735
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:06.490
action even in their sleep.

736
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.060
Close combat allows little time to think,

737
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:15.920
do it right and training and you'll do it right when the incoming slugs flash

738
00:48:15.921 --> 00:48:16.754
by.

739
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

740
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.400
<v 0>Training and discipline.
Discipline in trading.</v>

741
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.443
<v 2>Okay.</v>

742
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:27.310
<v 0>The men groaned and moaned,</v>

743
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:32.790
but sacrificing and suffering together gave them pride in taking all that crazy

744
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:37.630
bastard could throw at us as a tenant.
Taller described it.

745
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.090
So now you're starting to get them unified a little bit just in fighting against

746
00:48:45.091 --> 00:48:47.350
the man,
you know,
against Hackworth.
I'll will,

747
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:53.050
that's very similar to what happens in the bootcamp or in officer candidate

748
00:48:54.271 --> 00:48:56.680
school.
The,

749
00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:01.470
the drill instructor or the drill sergeant sort of becomes the enemy that you're

750
00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:05.970
fighting against.
You know,
you want it but you want to,
you want to beat him.

751
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:10.350
You don't want them to find dirt.
You want,
you want your room to be squared away,

752
00:49:10.351 --> 00:49:12.570
you want the,
the platoon to be squared away.

753
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.510
And so you start to unify as a team.

754
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.780
But the only reason you're unifying as a team is because there's someone to

755
00:49:18.781 --> 00:49:23.160
unify against.
Right.
On purpose kind of.
Yeah.
Yeah.

756
00:49:23.161 --> 00:49:25.590
And then eventually you realize that he's doing,

757
00:49:25.591 --> 00:49:27.810
it's the same thing that he taught me to talk about here.

758
00:49:27.811 --> 00:49:32.070
Eventually you realize that he's doing this to make you a better person and make

759
00:49:32.071 --> 00:49:33.540
your unit stronger.
Yeah.

760
00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.313
<v 2>Okay.</v>

761
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:41.370
<v 0>Hot Chow routine under lark was now a blurred memory from softer days.</v>

762
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:47.650
My idea of looking after the troops is not to spoon feed them,

763
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:52.000
but to make them as hard as forged steel deadly in there.

764
00:49:52.001 --> 00:49:54.040
Kill or be killed.
Trade

765
00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:00.100
eating c rations everyone knew could easily eat.

766
00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:03.520
Everyone knew hot food could easily be flown in,

767
00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:08.740
made the point better than 10 lectures.
The ways of the past were over.

768
00:50:08.741 --> 00:50:10.760
That's something that I didn't talk about.
LARC would flow,

769
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:15.400
would have hot food delivered on a daily basis and there's risk and there'd be

770
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:20.080
convoys that would get blown up and Hackworth.
No,
we're going to eat field food.

771
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.450
The ways of the past were over.
Stay alert and stay alive.

772
00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:31.890
You make a unit proud by praising it and you can't make a soldier proud by

773
00:50:31.971 --> 00:50:34.940
telling him how tough or good he is.

774
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:39.920
That's superficial stuff.
No pain,
no gain.

775
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.460
They had to earn it.

776
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:47.870
The standard was perfection and not just for the grunts.

777
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.110
All the battalion support personnel,
cooks,
corks,

778
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.820
supply drivers were to be soldiers.
First

779
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:00.390
important stuff.

780
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:04.470
Your unit doesn't become good just by you telling them that they're good.

781
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:09.330
In fact,
I always think that sets them back.
You're good to go.
Oh,

782
00:51:09.331 --> 00:51:12.420
you're doing great.
But they get that little bit of satisfaction.

783
00:51:12.421 --> 00:51:15.660
They get the satisfaction of their ego starts to think,
I'm doing great.

784
00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:19.830
I'm doing great.
Yeah,
I don't.
You train as hard,
right?

785
00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:23.040
Even just for one day,
you don't think I'm doing great.
Yeah,

786
00:51:23.041 --> 00:51:25.980
I'm ahead of the game,
but whatever little day off over there.
Yeah.

787
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.233
Not Good at plan.

788
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:28.403
<v 1>Nope.</v>

789
00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.570
<v 0>Regardless of my heavy schedule,
I made sure to talk to every replacement,</v>

790
00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.140
to welcome them to the hardcore before they went out to their units at night.

791
00:51:39.141 --> 00:51:42.100
I'd come back from operations late and sergeant major press would have the

792
00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:43.750
replacements assembled and waiting.

793
00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.800
I stretched to each new man how important he was,

794
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:51.550
how important it was to follow the basic fundamentals of the infantry man's

795
00:51:51.551 --> 00:51:54.520
trade.
With the zeal of evangelist,

796
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:59.290
all hardcore leaders drilled into new guys that when they joined the hardcore,

797
00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.510
they were joining a special brotherhood.

798
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:06.430
I made the code for the these leaders.
Simple and clear.

799
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:12.250
Fight Smart.
Never be in a hurry.
Lead from up front.

800
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:17.380
Set the examples.
Take care of the truth the for you.
Take care of yourself.

801
00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.660
Keep the good camo going.

802
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:24.370
Follow the Vietnam Primer and the battalion combat leaders guide.

803
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.773
<v 1>That's it.</v>

804
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.430
<v 0>Simple,
clearer instructions for his leadership.</v>

805
00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:40.530
Many combat vets come to think they know it all and start taking shortcuts.

806
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.760
They blow off the basics and neglect the little things that keep them alive

807
00:52:45.761 --> 00:52:49.180
because they get cocky or think it's better for their men's morale.

808
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.150
They build a fire at dusk,
smoke at night,
walk on trails.

809
00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:59.090
Don't carry their weapons.
Goof off on security.

810
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.010
Don't save their grenades or weapons.

811
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.160
Where mosquito repellent on ambush or patrol don't send out flank security on

812
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:10.250
operations.
Shortcuts get you killed.

813
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.010
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

814
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:14.750
<v 0>the troops continued to bitch,</v>

815
00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.990
but that changed when they saw the tough love was for real.

816
00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:21.950
One day murder,
one of his leadership,

817
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.830
one day murder saw soldier wearing jungle boots with the toes out and

818
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:28.380
immediately gave him his own,
a pair of his own,

819
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.270
which happened to be the right size.
The story spread like wildfire.
Finally,

820
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.300
someone cared not long afterward Merton or went down in the CNC chopper to pick

821
00:53:39.461 --> 00:53:44.370
up a wounded soldier,
a soldier wounded by a mine as the medic slip,

822
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:48.450
the wounded man on the chopper floor,
he looked up at murder,
grinned,

823
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:49.403
saluted,

824
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:55.280
and said hardcore Reccondo Sir or new Gung Ho attitude started to take hold

825
00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:08.920
and that's
the opening of the book.

826
00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.720
And then you get into the combat that they went through,
which was

827
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.400
just a great,

828
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:21.410
great stories and lessons you can learn from understanding the tactics that they

829
00:54:21.411 --> 00:54:24.200
use,
the leadership,
the pressure situations that they went through.

830
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:32.370
And it's definitely a book that you should get and read so you can absorb all

831
00:54:34.781 --> 00:54:35.650
that information.

832
00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:40.150
But I'm going to go to the end of the book,

833
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.280
did he afterward?

834
00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:48.210
And it's something that hack war wrote basically right after he had got done.

835
00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:51.920
Right.

836
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.670
Right after he got done being the battalion commander and he'd led them through

837
00:54:54.671 --> 00:54:59.650
a bunch of combat.
He changed them from the hopeless to the hardcore fan track.

838
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.850
Fantastic display of leadership.

839
00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>

840
00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:08.390
<v 0>Then it's,
you know,
it's like the boat crew story.
And in our book,</v>

841
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:11.930
you know when the,
when they changed the boat crews from the boat crew,

842
00:55:11.931 --> 00:55:16.040
six team is in the last place in all the races and in broke or two's winning all

843
00:55:16.041 --> 00:55:19.280
the races and they just switched the leaders and all of a sudden boat crew six

844
00:55:19.281 --> 00:55:20.240
starts winning the races.

845
00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.970
It's the same thing here you have a battalion that's horrible,

846
00:55:22.971 --> 00:55:25.610
that's the one of the worst that's got the worst record in Vietnam.

847
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:26.900
And sure enough,

848
00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:31.040
you put in a new leader and they become the best battalion in Vietnam.

849
00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.820
Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

850
00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.013
<v 2>Okay,</v>

851
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:43.230
<v 0>so from those,
from that experience,
he goes into this,</v>

852
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.290
I could never figure out army logic.

853
00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:52.790
The command of an infantry or tank platoon is the most demanding and dangerous

854
00:55:52.791 --> 00:55:54.170
job in the armed forces.

855
00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:58.520
Yet the army senior brass consistently failed to recognize this reality and

856
00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:02.540
provide lieutenants which practical hands on training they need.

857
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.251
As a result,

858
00:56:04.251 --> 00:56:08.840
platoons too frequently wind up under their command of under the command of the

859
00:56:08.841 --> 00:56:13.070
least qualified,
most inexperienced leaders in the military.

860
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:18.770
The average infantry lieutenant who joined hardcore in 1969 was simply not

861
00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:23.680
prepared to lead a rifle platoon because the army's approach to training failed

862
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.860
to ready him for the reality of combat Vietnam.

863
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:29.200
He was extremely weak in true bleeding,

864
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:34.320
practical knowledge and small unit combat operations and was almost without

865
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:36.550
actual field experience.

866
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:42.900
The old saying good judgment comes from experience and experienced is gained

867
00:56:43.271 --> 00:56:47.500
from bad judgement was certainly applicable in the hardcore,

868
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:51.700
and this is something that if you're a leader in a leadership position,

869
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:56.350
you have to let your subordinates lead and you have to let them exercise their

870
00:56:56.351 --> 00:56:59.260
judgment and you've got to let them see the consequences of bad judgment.

871
00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.770
If you don't,
they're never gonna learn

872
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.790
back to the book.
Besides technical and tactical incompetence,

873
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:14.820
the next biggest shortcomings of new infantry leader replacements were a failure

874
00:57:14.891 --> 00:57:19.630
to be demanding and a reluctance to ensure that their men carried out the basics

875
00:57:19.631 --> 00:57:24.470
that would keep them alive on the battlefield.
Lack of discipline.

876
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:29.570
One of the reasons for these deficiencies was that many of the social values

877
00:57:29.571 --> 00:57:33.320
were diametrically opposed to what's expected of a combat leader.

878
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.890
To take a single case in point.

879
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:41.930
I had to constantly deal with a civilian instilled value that drastically

880
00:57:41.931 --> 00:57:46.040
conflicts with the combat leadership principle.

881
00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:47.810
Popularity.

882
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

883
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.040
<v 0>By the time these young men entered the army,</v>

884
00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:56.330
they'd been brainwashed for at least 20 years about the importance of being a

885
00:57:56.331 --> 00:58:01.060
nice guy.
After four years of college ROTC,

886
00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:05.300
your military academy training or about a year of basic infantry and ocs,

887
00:58:05.301 --> 00:58:09.440
they were supposed to be well prepared leaders who always placed the welfare of

888
00:58:09.441 --> 00:58:13.040
their troops just below the accomplishment of the mission wrong.

889
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:18.340
The average new lieutenant who joined the hardcore had an almost Pavlovian

890
00:58:18.651 --> 00:58:20.630
instinct for being popular,

891
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:26.170
so the definition of welfare was up for grabs because he had to be a good guy.

892
00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:31.460
He'd become a joiner instead of an enforcer.

893
00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.180
Instead of a leader,
become part of the pack.

894
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.140
Need to step up and be a leader

895
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.080
in Vietnam.
Good guys,

896
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.520
let their people smoke at night and take portable radios to the field.

897
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:53.470
Good guys allowed night ambushes to be set up an abandoned hooches so they

898
00:58:53.471 --> 00:58:55.090
wouldn't get wet and left.

899
00:58:55.091 --> 00:58:59.230
Only one guard by the door so everyone else could get a good night's rest.

900
00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:03.550
I let their men leaves their boots on for several days and didn't inspect their

901
00:59:03.551 --> 00:59:07.810
feet,
resulting in immersion foot.
They didn't make sure they're men,

902
00:59:07.811 --> 00:59:12.040
kept their weapons and magazines perfectly clean or protected themselves against

903
00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:16.210
mosquitoes or took the required material,
uh,
malaria pills,

904
00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:21.920
good guy.
Lieutenants ended up killing their men with kindness.

905
00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:30.190
And you got to ask yourself,
even,
I mean,
this is,
you know,

906
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.400
we're talking about combat here,

907
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:36.140
but if you're in a leadership position in a business and you're not helping your

908
00:59:36.141 --> 00:59:40.790
troops by enforcing,
by teaching,
by holding the line,
by disciplining them.

909
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:45.330
If you're in charge of a group of people and you're not doing that,
you're,

910
00:59:45.331 --> 00:59:47.420
they're not going to perform the way they're supposed to perform.

911
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.100
They're not going to,

912
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.770
then that means your business isn't going to perform the way your business is

913
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:54.470
supposed to perform.
That means your business is going to go down.

914
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.010
So you're actually going to take the job away from the person,

915
00:59:58.011 --> 00:59:59.510
cause you're not gonna be able to afford to pay him anymore.

916
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:03.200
So because you didn't hold the line because you want it to be nice cause you

917
01:00:03.201 --> 01:00:06.860
wanted to be a good guy.
You're,

918
01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.170
you're actually doing the worst thing for them.

919
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:13.370
You're killing them with kindness.
Right.
Is that kind of like,
Whoa,
how you said,

920
01:00:13.371 --> 01:00:15.700
um,
something about your kids.
Like if I'm helping them on the,

921
01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.000
I'm helping them iron vertigo.
Right,
right.
That's very similar.
Cause if you're,

922
01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:22.940
if you're letting your,
let's say you've got salespeople and you say,

923
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:25.340
Oh you know what?
Don't worry about making some phone calls today.
Right?

924
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:27.020
You know what?
I don't want to push you too hard.

925
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.780
What would you rather just go for lunch with me?
Would that be nice?

926
01:00:29.781 --> 01:00:32.510
Would that make me a good guy?
What should they,
what should you be doing?

927
01:00:32.511 --> 01:00:34.580
If you're a good leader?
Should be saying,
look,
get on the phone.

928
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.970
You got bills to pay,
you've got a mortgage to pay,

929
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.390
you got kids you want to send to college,
get on the phone and start dialing.

930
01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:45.470
Make it happen.
Let's go,
let's do this.
Are you,

931
01:00:45.471 --> 01:00:47.900
are you a better leader if you do that?
If you're going,
well,
that's their school.

932
01:00:47.901 --> 01:00:51.710
I hadn't gone to lunch and understand you're not in the mood.
I know that field.

933
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:56.450
Let's go eat lunch and have them.
That's a great,

934
01:00:57.050 --> 01:01:01.190
a great twist on that term of killing people with kindness because I actually

935
01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:03.500
use that.
You know when someone's being a jerk,
how,
what should you do?

936
01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:06.020
I always say,
oh yeah,
I know.
Kill them with kindness and I literally mean it,

937
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:07.960
but this is a different way of doing it.
Yeah,

938
01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.220
it's obviously a whole different thing.
It's just the same phrase

939
01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.140
while the back to the book,

940
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:18.740
while the run of the mill lieutenants had a vague idea of what was required,

941
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:22.610
he didn't have the experience or good sense to enforce the rules.

942
01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.740
When push came to shove,

943
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:28.460
he preferred to turn his head the other way rather than come down hard on

944
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:29.390
slackers.

945
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.280
He overlooked efficiencies such as dirty weapons and ammunition,

946
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.630
improperly safe weapons and grenade,
incorrect camouflage technique,

947
01:01:38.631 --> 01:01:40.550
and the improper use of terrain,

948
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.820
not using natural cover to provide protection from small arms fire and without

949
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.490
an ass kicking company,
skipper or demanding NCO,

950
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:53.900
the soldiers habits became sloppier and sloppier,

951
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.150
carelessness ruled,

952
01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:59.990
and of course the result was casualties that could have been prevented had the

953
01:01:59.991 --> 01:02:03.200
lieutenant demanded the small things be done well.

954
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:09.560
My own experience has been that soldiers in combat will do only what's required

955
01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:13.880
of them under week.
Nice guy leadership.

956
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.890
They'll try to get away with everything.

957
01:02:15.891 --> 01:02:20.891
They can violate every basic rule in the at the same time because they know

958
01:02:23.011 --> 01:02:27.450
they're wrong and that this behavior is placing their lives in jeopardy.

959
01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:31.530
They'll respond to the demands of a positive ass kicking leader.

960
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:36.690
The result will be fewer casualties and developing respect for the leader who

961
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:39.540
cares enough roos men to make them do it right.

962
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.170
So that's important to think about.
This is not,

963
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.440
some people hear this kind of talk that I'm saying and all of a sudden they want

964
01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:49.710
to turn into a super hyper aggressive person.

965
01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:53.880
That's going berserk on everybody and trying to enforce every little,

966
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:59.060
every little order and every little discipline so hard that it,

967
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.310
it breaks the guys down and again,
that's why.

968
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:03.270
That's why I focused on that in the beginning.
That guy,

969
01:03:03.271 --> 01:03:04.530
the first guy was super hardcore.

970
01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:07.350
You could imagine that he would probably had people saluting him in the field

971
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:09.780
too.
He probably,
you know was,
hey,

972
01:03:09.781 --> 01:03:13.320
you come to attention when I walk in the room and he was probably super hardcore

973
01:03:13.321 --> 01:03:17.580
on stuff,
but it was stuff that didn't matter.
It wasn't the important stuff.

974
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.640
And so there's a fine line and he makes a great,

975
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:25.320
a great point here of pointing out that your troops,

976
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.190
they know what's right.
They know that you're there to help them.

977
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.870
They're going to take the easiest way possible.

978
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.250
But when you actually step up and lead and you explain to them why this is

979
01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:35.731
important to you,

980
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:39.000
explain to them why this is why this is going to keep them alive and why it's

981
01:03:39.001 --> 01:03:40.710
going to make the company more successful.

982
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:46.670
Then you will actually get traction and you will get loyalty.

983
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.550
Because when you keep these guys alive,
they become loyalty.

984
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:53.940
When you get your salesperson to to sell more and do more,

985
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.260
they're going to be loyal to you.

986
01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.280
When you get your manufacturing team to produce more and do it faster there

987
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:04.890
because you pushed them a little bit harder,
they're going to respect you.

988
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:06.900
They're going to thank you.

989
01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.940
<v 3>Yup.
They're going to follow you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's uh,</v>

990
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:17.600
that's real clear.
There were,
when you show them some results,
they'll,

991
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:21.580
you know,
they'll back to it.
Remember that movie,
the boiler room I brought up?

992
01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.880
[inaudible] so he said he'd mentioned something along those lines where he's

993
01:04:24.881 --> 01:04:29.620
like,
show them a small return and they'll on and on.
I forget what he said.

994
01:04:29.621 --> 01:04:33.280
Like they'll give you their first born.
If something like that same thing,

995
01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:37.990
you show them just a little bit of results like,
um,
like karate kid.

996
01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.200
Remember karate kid when he's making them.
So yeah,
wax on,
wax off.

997
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.980
He's making him do that.
He's making them sand the floor,
paint the fence,

998
01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:49.120
all this stuff.
He's mad,
but he starts off with a little bit of trust in him.

999
01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:51.410
You know,
cause he,
he saw him,
you know,

1000
01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.970
he's a credit guy and then when he saw the results he was like,
Oh man,
Mr

1001
01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:01.900
Miyagi,
Mr Miyagi was real.
He's a real loyal to him.
Exactly.
Same thing.

1002
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:06.980
<v 0>Another SPEC to book.</v>

1003
01:05:06.981 --> 01:05:11.060
Another serious shortcoming was the failure to teach leaders the importance of

1004
01:05:11.061 --> 01:05:15.940
supervision and the techniques of supervising the average small unit leader in

1005
01:05:15.941 --> 01:05:20.941
1969 to take for granted that is a will would be done and that he didn't have to

1006
01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:22.054
follow up.

1007
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:30.350
You kind of follow up.
You got to inspect,
especially in the beginning.

1008
01:05:30.351 --> 01:05:34.790
Do you get the tone right to people understand what it's about,

1009
01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:36.260
what you're about as a leader?

1010
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:37.203
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1011
01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.710
<v 0>The nature of combat and the Mekong Delta and how we operate in the hardcore</v>

1012
01:05:43.711 --> 01:05:48.150
greatly extended this problem because small units normally operate on a wildly

1013
01:05:48.151 --> 01:05:50.970
decentralized basis in bitching terrain.

1014
01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.380
This restricted regular visits from the company in Battalion leaders prohibiting

1015
01:05:55.381 --> 01:05:59.670
more experienced senior officers and in Ceos from checking the platoons and

1016
01:05:59.671 --> 01:06:04.490
passing along tips of the trade without an experienced,

1017
01:06:04.491 --> 01:06:05.820
demanding leader.

1018
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:11.150
These carelessly lead platoons were headed for a world of hurt the infrequency

1019
01:06:12.061 --> 01:06:17.061
of heavy combat compared to World War II or Korea in 1950 and 51 and the

1020
01:06:18.211 --> 01:06:19.044
prevalent,

1021
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:24.110
all his cool attitude had a tendency to low soldiers and leaders into a false

1022
01:06:24.991 --> 01:06:26.160
sense of safety.

1023
01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:30.270
The more alertness and security went slack,

1024
01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:33.750
the greater the danger of an enemy attack became.

1025
01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:39.740
We played right into the enemy's hands as sun sue put it so well when the enemy

1026
01:06:41.491 --> 01:06:43.590
is weak attack.

1027
01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:49.300
So when World War II and Korea and you know,
50 and 51 in Korea,
they,

1028
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.860
they were fighting so often that everyone knew they had to be squared away.

1029
01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:56.190
But here you might go some time.
You know,

1030
01:06:56.191 --> 01:06:59.060
nothing happened yesterday and nothing happened the day before and nothing's

1031
01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:01.950
happened for the last week.
Maybe I don't need to clean my weapon tonight.

1032
01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:04.560
Maybe I don't need to dig into a new fighting position.

1033
01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:09.090
Maybe I don't need to wear my body armor.
You do.

1034
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:17.700
I had to inculcate the hardcore leaders with the burning need to keep their

1035
01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:20.310
people are alert and never let down their guard.

1036
01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:26.090
I had to instill in them the need to supervise the troops 24 hours a day to make

1037
01:07:26.401 --> 01:07:29.670
sure that the fighting positions were adequate.
Soldiers knew the mission,

1038
01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:32.840
the situation and where the LPS were.
Proper fields.

1039
01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:34.410
Sanitation was being practiced.

1040
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:39.330
All battlefield debris was destroyed to deny the enemy a source of supply.

1041
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:41.790
The troops were all sleeping,

1042
01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:46.850
undercover and protected from first round hits and fire support bases or camps.

1043
01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:52.290
Subordinate leaders were heads up and demanding that their men were alert and

1044
01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:57.291
tightly controlled and never ending list of the little things.

1045
01:07:58.230 --> 01:08:01.860
Rifle magazines,
cleaned weapons test fired grenades,

1046
01:08:01.861 --> 01:08:06.480
safe to lps and claymores out sectors of fire,
known salt tablets,

1047
01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:08.250
malaria pills,
jungle rot,

1048
01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.080
all monitored by the medics stand twos frequently conducted.

1049
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:14.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1050
01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:19.250
<v 0>I to get every leader to follow this adage,</v>

1051
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:23.900
the best fertilizer in the world is the bosses footsteps.

1052
01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:28.520
They make things grow.
So it's just,

1053
01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:32.480
I mean that that was just a giant list of all the little things and you know we

1054
01:08:32.481 --> 01:08:34.280
talked about this when we talked about Chechnya,

1055
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:37.940
but some of the lessons learned there and how it all started to fall apart for

1056
01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:38.780
the Russians when the,

1057
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:43.910
when the guys stopped shaving and this is the same thing that Hackworth is

1058
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:48.710
saying.
You got to hold the line on the little things and I will tell you this,

1059
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.290
you need to hold the line and you need to hold the line by explaining to the

1060
01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:58.130
troops why it's important.
You can't expect just to say,
Hey,

1061
01:08:58.131 --> 01:09:02.360
I told you to clean your weapon because if I'm not coming back for another week,

1062
01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:07.580
you know that you're going to clean it on the sixth day one time.

1063
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:11.630
What happens if you get contacted on the fifth day and your weapons not working

1064
01:09:11.631 --> 01:09:14.180
now.
So I get explained to you,
hey look,
this is what's going on.

1065
01:09:14.181 --> 01:09:16.910
This is why it's important.
You can get contacted at any time.

1066
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:20.930
You need to have your weapon ready to all time.
Most important thing to me.
Echo.

1067
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.060
Look,
I want to take you home.

1068
01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:28.061
I want you to get home to your family and the only thing that's gonna keep you

1069
01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:31.190
alive in a firefight is this weapon you have right here.

1070
01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:34.970
And although we may go two days,
three days,
five days,

1071
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.760
five weeks without getting in a firefight,

1072
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:40.910
we don't know if it's going to happen in the next 30 seconds.

1073
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.480
So you got to keep that weapon ready so you're ready at the moment of truth.

1074
01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:45.860
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

1075
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.910
That's when you explain people why they're doing what they're doing.

1076
01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.350
Because now you say that's going to be back in the back of your head.

1077
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:58.100
You're going to be thinking like,
you know what Jack told me,

1078
01:09:58.101 --> 01:10:01.550
I better get this thing cleaned.
This is important.
If I want to stay alive,

1079
01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:04.580
I need to keep this weapon clean.
Boom.
Guess what you're going to do?

1080
01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.280
Break out your field cleaning kit and you're going to get it done.
Yup.

1081
01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.110
Clean your room.
Why?
Because I said so.
I'm not going to work.

1082
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:16.820
I'm not going to work.
Yeah,
not going to work.

1083
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.010
You know what it'll work for for two days.
You know,
maybe,

1084
01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.660
maybe I can do the bare minimum.
Yeah,
you might do the bare minimum slack.

1085
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.970
Just do a little bit.
But if you explain to people why,
I mean in your room,

1086
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.640
why you got to clean your room?
You know what?

1087
01:10:34.641 --> 01:10:39.080
I have guests coming over the our family.
It needs to be represented well.

1088
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.640
If you're looking like a Slob,

1089
01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:44.270
and I have one of my clients come by and they see that my own kids can't be

1090
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:48.470
disciplined enough to clean the room and you think they're going to hire me to

1091
01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:51.650
come straighten out their company?
No.
Wrong answer.

1092
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:54.830
Brush your teeth.
That's a big one to get out.

1093
01:10:54.831 --> 01:10:58.100
The rug can get out the vacuum and get that thing cleaned.

1094
01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.310
When you till you get to go brush your teeth when they're young,
you know,

1095
01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:06.380
go brush your teeth.
Oh they don't want to price it.
Like why you teeth fall out?

1096
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:09.260
Yeah.
You got to show them that the nasty dental pictures,

1097
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:13.270
people that don't brush their teeth and see how that turns out for.
Yup.

1098
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.760
And then you tell him,
you know,

1099
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:18.600
that's what you're going to look like when they're five years old and they

1100
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:22.080
didn't.
They turn into like a obsessive compulsive teeth.

1101
01:11:22.081 --> 01:11:26.250
Brushers so we use caution.
Use the medium level of uh,

1102
01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:30.030
of nasty looking teeth rot.
Just the medium level.

1103
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.960
Don't find the crystal meth people that,
that have their teeth falling out.

1104
01:11:33.961 --> 01:11:35.740
Don't show him that it's a little too extreme.
They'll,

1105
01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:39.330
they'll brush their teeth too much.
Just find the cavity situations

1106
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:43.200
or just tell him,
you know,
I dunno,

1107
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.900
just tell him what that their teeth are going to rot out if the kids are visual

1108
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:53.790
most of the time,
do you want your teeth throughout out?
They'll say,

1109
01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:56.880
no.
Yeah,
boom.
Maybe that could work.

1110
01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.120
We'll check out the dental hygienists here in a few years on the,

1111
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:01.170
on the children's,

1112
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.560
make a decision back to the book the principal was to learn so that we didn't

1113
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:12.180
keep making the same mistakes again and again to do this,

1114
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:17.210
we can't be the VC technique of ruthlessly examining every operation and

1115
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:18.600
exercise.

1116
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.740
That was a lot easier for the VC because they weren't as rigid about rank as we

1117
01:12:22.741 --> 01:12:25.470
were.
When rank rules,

1118
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:30.060
people say yes or when they should say no fucking way.

1119
01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:36.180
I wanted to instill a particular cert of insubordination,

1120
01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.320
don't get me wrong,
when I told the men to do something,
I wanted it done,

1121
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:45.470
but I also wanted an atmosphere where no one would be afraid to sound off and

1122
01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:51.600
speak the truth.
This is the dichotomy.

1123
01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:54.960
This is the balance you don't want,
and even Hackworth,

1124
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:57.540
as strict as he was and he wanted everyone to do all these,

1125
01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:58.500
we'll keep all these small things.

1126
01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:03.210
He wanted them to have a rebellious snus in them to say,
you know what?

1127
01:13:03.211 --> 01:13:05.080
Heck out of it.
We're doing this wrong,
or you know what hack?

1128
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.810
I think that's the wrong way to do.
Or you know what hack?

1129
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:11.730
I think you should have pushed us over there or left us back over here or we're

1130
01:13:11.731 --> 01:13:15.540
not going to do this.
It's stupid.
That's what he wants.

1131
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:20.430
And that's something that a lot of military people have a hard time with because

1132
01:13:20.431 --> 01:13:25.431
they get offended by someone of junior rank stepping up to them and saying,

1133
01:13:26.581 --> 01:13:28.920
Hey boss,
this is wrong and you can't have that attitude.

1134
01:13:28.921 --> 01:13:33.921
You've got to welcome and encourage people to check you and test you and

1135
01:13:34.771 --> 01:13:39.030
question you.
That's what you want.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's when they take it personal.

1136
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.600
Oh yeah.
That's pretty much it.
And they take your person.
Yeah,

1137
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:47.010
like he stepped to me.
He didn't step to like the order or the,
you know,

1138
01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:51.900
the little scenario that I painted,
he's east up to me with it.
Unacceptable.
Yo,

1139
01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.490
check your ego back to the book.
After every operation,

1140
01:13:56.491 --> 01:14:00.900
we'd sit down at the squad platoon and company level and work up a detailed

1141
01:14:00.901 --> 01:14:05.370
critique that spared no harsh words.
It was,
Tom,

1142
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.600
you had your machine gun in the wrong firing position.
Bill.
You're right.
You're,

1143
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:13.450
you triggered the ambush early.
Hank,
you're go to hell.
Plants sucked.

1144
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.180
War is so simple.

1145
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:20.710
Yet the military school system tries to make it so damn complicated.

1146
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:26.370
Probably they need to propagate a mystique in order to protect their turf,

1147
01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:32.800
but the bare bones bottom line to winning in battle is simply to sneak up on

1148
01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:36.640
your opponent and belt the shit out of him from behind as hard and quickly as

1149
01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:40.750
you can before he figures out you're in the neighborhood and then beat it the

1150
01:14:40.751 --> 01:14:44.830
hell out of there.
We should train our small units in,

1151
01:14:44.831 --> 01:14:46.330
not in the classroom,

1152
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:51.600
but in the Bush where warriors can be taught the gut fundamentals of infantry

1153
01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:52.954
combat.

1154
01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:58.890
Raw Mill said the best form of welfare for the troops is first class training

1155
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:03.070
for this saves unnecessary casualties.

1156
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:07.870
Class training means hard work and sacrifice.

1157
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:12.310
General Bruce Clark's adage,

1158
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:15.460
the more we sweat all know training field,

1159
01:15:15.461 --> 01:15:19.270
the less we bleed on the battlefield is one of followed.

1160
01:15:19.271 --> 01:15:24.271
Ever since I was a teenager and I'm convinced it keeps the casualty list short.

1161
01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:29.980
Everybody knows those two.
Does everybody follow him?

1162
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:33.700
Not always.
Not always.

1163
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:38.890
You see it with the military,
with police,
with fire,

1164
01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:42.040
with salespeople.

1165
01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:47.650
Are you putting your troops to realistic training that's hard and making them

1166
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:50.770
sweat and making them think,
are you doing that?

1167
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:53.140
You need to know

1168
01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.520
cadets and new leaders who show ineptitude and little leadership ability such as

1169
01:16:00.711 --> 01:16:02.330
that walking atrocity,

1170
01:16:02.331 --> 01:16:07.331
Lieutenant William Calley of the my Lai massacre infamy should be immediately

1171
01:16:07.761 --> 01:16:10.790
eliminated.
And I left this in here because this is an important port.

1172
01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.710
If you W uh,
William Calley,

1173
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:16.940
he's a guy that did horrible massacre at my light in Vietnam,

1174
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:19.550
murdered a bunch of civilians.

1175
01:16:20.210 --> 01:16:23.690
Kelly was recycled three times at infantry,

1176
01:16:23.691 --> 01:16:28.691
ocs after being found wanting in leadership before finally being commissioned in

1177
01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:32.240
order to show a low attrition rate to higher headquarters.

1178
01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:34.930
A bad mistake with big consequences.

1179
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:36.860
They had a guy they knew he was a weak leader,

1180
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:42.850
he was showing weak leadership in his position going through officer candidate

1181
01:16:44.661 --> 01:16:48.500
school.
And what do they do?
They recycle them three times.

1182
01:16:48.501 --> 01:16:51.230
So we failed three times.
They keep pushing them through,
keep pushing through,

1183
01:16:51.231 --> 01:16:52.610
keep pushing through.
They finally makes it through.

1184
01:16:52.611 --> 01:16:56.700
He goes out and commits a horrible atrocity cause he's a weak leader.
Hmm,

1185
01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:58.620
<v 1>okay.</v>

1186
01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.960
<v 0>You cannot lower the standards</v>

1187
01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.040
more than any major enemy victory.

1188
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:12.100
The shame and horror of my lay because the American people to withdraw their

1189
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:17.450
support from the war effort.
Once they saw what Kelly had wrought,

1190
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:19.970
they said enough is enough.

1191
01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.013
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1192
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.070
<v 0>In small unit leaders confidence like fear is contagious.</v>

1193
01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:30.480
Troopers can feel it,

1194
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:34.800
see it and smell it and it will rub off on shoulders from a platoon to a

1195
01:17:34.801 --> 01:17:38.130
division as quickly as a good rumor rumbles out of the latrine.

1196
01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.070
Confidence produces courage.

1197
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.400
Most leaders or soldiers aren't born with a double basic load of guts.

1198
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:52.550
The average leaders are scared as the next guy in their first or 100 firefight.

1199
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.610
But if they are confident that they're tactically proficient,

1200
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:58.380
that their units squared away.

1201
01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:02.160
Team motivated by a strong sense of duty to accomplish the mission,

1202
01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:06.870
the courage that's needed to do what many will view as impossible will be.

1203
01:18:06.871 --> 01:18:10.260
Their mouth's may go dry.

1204
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:15.390
Guts may churn and handshake,
but when the slug starts snapping,

1205
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:18.270
that prepared leader will be as cool.
On the outside,

1206
01:18:18.271 --> 01:18:23.070
it's Clint Eastwood and no one will know he's really scared out of his brain.

1207
01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:25.923
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1208
01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:28.680
<v 0>So if you're going into combat and you've never been there,</v>

1209
01:18:28.681 --> 01:18:32.130
you're in a leadership position or not,
you're nervous.

1210
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:37.200
It's okay.
No big deal.
Be Nervous.

1211
01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:38.400
Do your job.

1212
01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.990
Besides being one hell of a job.

1213
01:18:43.991 --> 01:18:48.970
Leading men into battle is the ultimate responsibility on the battlefield.

1214
01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:53.560
Decisions such as go left or go right or go straight ahead or made in a split

1215
01:18:53.561 --> 01:18:58.150
second and right or wrong,
good or bad.
People get killed.

1216
01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:04.300
Leaders carry the scars of those decisions for the rest of their lives.

1217
01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.680
Later battle scenes play back deep into the night like an old movie.

1218
01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:16.750
Why didn't I wait?
Why didn't that bring in more fire?
Why didn't I go myself?

1219
01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:18.160
Why didn't I go to the left?

1220
01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:24.450
Questions that will haunt the blooded combat leader until he's six feet under

1221
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:31.370
good preparation training.
Knowing your job and attention to detail.

1222
01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:36.371
We'll keep the nightmares and any casualties to a minimum.

1223
01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:43.230
To be a combat leader in the profession of arms is one of the most noble,

1224
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.330
most deadly jobs going.

1225
01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.010
It's rough and tough and its rewards are few.

1226
01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:57.080
But if at the end of the day the troops say he's a good man as opposed to he was

1227
01:19:58.591 --> 01:19:59.610
a nice guy,

1228
01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:04.450
that's pretty much as good as it gets.

1229
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:15.690
And I know that's something that
something that I definitely felt

1230
01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:17.483
<v 2>okay</v>

1231
01:20:17.690 --> 01:20:18.890
<v 0>through my whole career,</v>

1232
01:20:18.891 --> 01:20:23.630
especially once the war started was I always felt like everything I need to do,

1233
01:20:23.631 --> 01:20:25.520
everything I can to have these guys ready,

1234
01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.100
everything I can to have these guys ready.

1235
01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.630
And when I was in charge of training and I was sending bill tunes overseas,

1236
01:20:32.631 --> 01:20:33.890
I felt the same way.

1237
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:37.700
This training is what they are relying on to keep them alive.

1238
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:43.460
And do you sit there and look back and say,
oh well you know,

1239
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:48.110
why didn't I wait?
Why it bring more fire?
Why didn't it go myself?

1240
01:20:48.111 --> 01:20:50.510
Why didn't I go to the left?
All those questions.
Yeah,

1241
01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:55.010
you're going to have those questions.
But those questions are quieter.

1242
01:20:56.550 --> 01:21:01.550
If you know that you did everything you can to prepare the guys for the

1243
01:21:02.911 --> 01:21:04.470
situations that they're going into

1244
01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:10.980
this book.
Obviously like,
like most of the books we bring on here,

1245
01:21:10.981 --> 01:21:14.460
I mean there's just so many lessons to learn,
so much knowledge to gain.

1246
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.260
And
I mean,
I wish,

1247
01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:24.640
I wish I would have learned them.
And you know,
I think part of it,

1248
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:27.310
and you,
you've talked about this the other day,

1249
01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:31.480
you were talking about how when you know Jujitsu,

1250
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.910
if you know Jujitsu,
then you can,

1251
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:39.510
you have a certain context that you can learn Jujitsu.

1252
01:21:39.511 --> 01:21:42.660
So if you know Jujitsu already,
you can make sense out of things.

1253
01:21:42.661 --> 01:21:46.080
Like you can watch a youtube video or you can read a book and you can look at
it,

1254
01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:50.120
you can say,
oh,
okay,
I,
I can do that.
Or you can go,
you can apply it.
Yeah.

1255
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.870
But if you have no experience,
would you Jitsu,

1256
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:58.440
it's very difficult just to look at a youtube.
You can do it,

1257
01:21:58.441 --> 01:22:03.300
but it's gonna take a lot longer because you don't have the context of the

1258
01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:06.690
moves.
And so you're going to need somebody to show you.

1259
01:22:06.691 --> 01:22:11.640
You're going to need to experience it yourself so that you can understand it in.

1260
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.100
And that's one of the things that I kind of think

1261
01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:20.630
of why people like this podcast and had sort of like what I have to offer is

1262
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:26.130
I've seen a lot of these things from a leadership perspective,

1263
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.990
from being simple tunes myself from growing up in the teams and then going into

1264
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.650
combat and then training platoons and then going into the corporate world and

1265
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:39.060
seeing what leadership is like.
There are in the context of that.
And I think,

1266
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:45.320
I think one of the reasons that people like this is because I can just sort of

1267
01:22:45.631 --> 01:22:50.631
help them put these things into context a little bit better and then they can

1268
01:22:50.881 --> 01:22:53.070
take them and put them into context in their own lives.

1269
01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:58.170
But it's nice to have that little bit of help,
but you can do it yourself.

1270
01:22:58.171 --> 01:23:02.220
Everybody has been led,
you've been led by people.

1271
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:07.360
Most people are,
have been in some kind of a leadership position,

1272
01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:10.870
even if they're in charge of one other person or five other people or a hundred

1273
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:11.704
other people,

1274
01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:16.740
but you've either led or you're being led and so you do have the contexts to put

1275
01:23:18.671 --> 01:23:19.510
these things in,

1276
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:25.090
but you just have to first of all,
do the work,

1277
01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:31.540
get the books out,
open them and read them.
And then when you read them,

1278
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:36.720
try and read them from a perspective of balancing or,

1279
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:41.020
or not balancing,

1280
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:45.940
but try and read them from the perspective of overlaying your own experiences on

1281
01:23:45.941 --> 01:23:49.330
top of them.
And that will,
that's what I do.

1282
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.530
I'm trying to kind of explain my process and what my process has been over the

1283
01:23:53.531 --> 01:23:57.550
past 20 years.
When I see something,
I see a leadership situation,

1284
01:23:58.150 --> 01:24:03.150
I overlay my own experiences on top of it and compare and contrast to it so that

1285
01:24:03.551 --> 01:24:05.290
way I can learn something from it.

1286
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:08.830
I just don't sit there and blindly watch a youtube video about Jujitsu without

1287
01:24:08.831 --> 01:24:10.210
putting context over it.
Right?

1288
01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.570
So that's what you got to do with leadership in my opinion.

1289
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:17.710
So great book.
Steal my soldiers,

1290
01:24:17.711 --> 01:24:21.700
our hearts by Colonel David Hackworth.

1291
01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:25.083
And

1292
01:24:26.730 --> 01:24:31.730
I think we can roll on two questions before we get it all into the interwebs and

1293
01:24:34.591 --> 01:24:36.000
the questions they're in.

1294
01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:41.040
Why don't you talk about how the interwebs can actually support this podcast?

1295
01:24:41.041 --> 01:24:41.970
Cheap Ball,
Huh?

1296
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.100
<v 3>Okay.
Uh,</v>

1297
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.860
where's he can can support this podcast and at the same time support yourself,

1298
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.220
which is Justin just as important in my opinion.

1299
01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:59.860
Supplementation on it.
Supplements are the,
are the best ones by far.

1300
01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:04.300
The only ones I take.
Yeah.
Only ones I take.

1301
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:07.360
Only one did you take,
I recommend Alpha brain.

1302
01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:10.840
I'm taking some Alpha brain right this second.
There you go.

1303
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:15.310
Proof is in the pudding.
Alpha,
Braden d,
The instant,
instant,
right.

1304
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:19.690
Fast results are better than slow results.
No,

1305
01:25:19.691 --> 01:25:24.370
but sometimes you need delayed results for,
you know,
anyway.
Um,

1306
01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.780
where are your bars as well?
I would recommend do yourself that favor big favor.

1307
01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:29.860
Um,

1308
01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:34.000
you can get 10% off half a box of warrior bars in your house because when you're

1309
01:25:34.001 --> 01:25:36.760
hungry and you don't want to eat something junk,

1310
01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:41.620
he just opened up a worry bar and you're basically eating a snickers bar.

1311
01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:46.330
It's as good as a snickers bar,
if not better.
And it's got protein in it.

1312
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:49.870
Yeah.
It's good for you.
It's different though.
It's different than a snickers bar.

1313
01:25:49.871 --> 01:25:53.350
It's not a dessert.
Oh,
that's not,
this is not disgustingly sweet.

1314
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:56.980
Sweet though.
Yeah,
but it's like a meal suite.

1315
01:25:56.981 --> 01:26:00.950
You know how I can eat like a teriyaki chicken?
How that's sweet.
Yeah,
but it's,

1316
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:05.180
it's good alliance.
Well,
I'll tell you what you do.
You know,
he's the EEC.

1317
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:07.730
He just keep a box of where you are on.

1318
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:10.740
It has this thing called stay on it and it's like,
uh,
you know,

1319
01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:15.710
they're recurring with a warrior bars.
That's a good call.
That's a good car.

1320
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:20.630
Did you say on att.com/jocko?
Yeah.
Yeah.
For the day.
For the 10% off.

1321
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:25.990
Because why pay 0% off when you can pay to pay 10 with 10% off the price anyway.

1322
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:30.110
[inaudible]
dot com slash Jocko also,

1323
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:35.111
another way you can support this podcast is by at times when you're about to do

1324
01:26:35.661 --> 01:26:37.310
amazon.com shopping,

1325
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:42.680
go to Jocko podcast.com first click on the Amazon link,

1326
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:46.880
then go to Amazon and then do some shopping.

1327
01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:50.810
Then Amazon will give us like a little percentage,
like a referral fee.

1328
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:55.910
So when you buy what you actually need and you support the podcast.

1329
01:26:56.330 --> 01:27:00.320
Yeah,
and also at [inaudible] dot com there's an Amazon link.
So boom.
Yeah,

1330
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.870
by what you are going to buy anyway.
Uh,
just click through there first.

1331
01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.770
You can support that way.
And of course

1332
01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.390
I would say arguably the best way.
Nah,
that's not the best way,

1333
01:27:11.391 --> 01:27:15.950
but a really good way to support this podcast is going to Jocko store.com and

1334
01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:19.940
get a shirt or two or a coffee mug or a bumper sticker

1335
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:25.280
if you'd like.
Yup.
There you go.
Boom.

1336
01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:29.000
Abort in one of those ways to appreciate the ceiling.
Get

1337
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:33.290
yes,
very much so.
Okay.
Question number one,

1338
01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:38.720
how do you relate between sop,

1339
01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:42.140
which is standard operating procedures and Jujitsu training?

1340
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.020
Could you say that the basics and fundamentals are the sop of grappling or

1341
01:27:48.021 --> 01:27:51.230
something like drilling your specific game?
Well,

1342
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:57.430
<v 4>so yeah,
this is uh,
this is a pretty actually an obvious question,</v>

1343
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:58.210
right?

1344
01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:00.730
The standard operating procedures and when you're talking about those with me,

1345
01:28:00.731 --> 01:28:04.060
yes,
they exist in business.
Yes,
they exist in companies.

1346
01:28:04.061 --> 01:28:06.670
The way companies handle situations for me,

1347
01:28:06.671 --> 01:28:08.710
I'm just going to bring it back to my roots.

1348
01:28:08.711 --> 01:28:11.320
In the military you have standard operating procedures for things,

1349
01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:12.940
your standard operating procedures.

1350
01:28:12.941 --> 01:28:17.470
For many of the things that you do as a unit or as a team,

1351
01:28:17.471 --> 01:28:19.300
you have the standard way of doing them.

1352
01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:24.520
And what's good is you drill and just like Hackworth just talked about this,

1353
01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:28.540
you drill those standard operating procedures on you train.

1354
01:28:28.541 --> 01:28:31.180
He's talking about how you train,
you train this,
you train this,
you train that,

1355
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:34.420
you train the other thing and you keep training until he says they're going to

1356
01:28:34.421 --> 01:28:38.590
roll out of bed in her and be able to react to a combat,
uh,
to uh,

1357
01:28:38.650 --> 01:28:42.340
to an ambush that's you react with standard operating procedures.

1358
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:45.790
So how do you get good at them?
You train them and you drill them.

1359
01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:49.510
Now they're same thing exists inside of grappling.

1360
01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.940
Someone starts to mount you.

1361
01:28:51.941 --> 01:28:55.330
You have a standard operating procedures to begin to escape them out.

1362
01:28:55.331 --> 01:28:58.630
Someone starts passing the guard.
You have or gets past the guard.

1363
01:28:58.631 --> 01:29:00.880
You have a standard operating procedure of the procedure that you're going to

1364
01:29:00.881 --> 01:29:02.370
take to get out of there.
You're gonna get the under rock.

1365
01:29:02.371 --> 01:29:04.650
You're going to come up to a single,
you know,
if someone mounts,

1366
01:29:04.670 --> 01:29:08.610
you're going to you,
you immediately put your elbows in tight,

1367
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.820
maybe try and shift her weight a little bit,
shift their weight a little bit,

1368
01:29:11.821 --> 01:29:14.310
get their knee light,
you're going to try and put them in back into half guard.

1369
01:29:14.311 --> 01:29:16.920
So these are all little state.
If someone starts to arm lock you,

1370
01:29:16.921 --> 01:29:18.420
what are you going to your put your weight down on them.

1371
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.130
If they're trying to army locking from the guard,

1372
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:21.990
you're going to have standard operating procedures.

1373
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:24.450
Just like when you're on the battlefield,

1374
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:26.460
you want your team to have standard operating procedures.

1375
01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.080
Definitely in grappling,

1376
01:29:28.081 --> 01:29:30.260
you're going to have standard operating procedures as well that you're going to

1377
01:29:30.261 --> 01:29:34.800
use.
Now,
the way you get there is by doing repetition.

1378
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:39.210
That's through drilling,
but in both situations,

1379
01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:45.770
you don't want to have people so strict in drilling that they lose the ability

1380
01:29:47.461 --> 01:29:49.260
to think you.

1381
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:53.550
If you have a person that all they ever do is drill in Jujitsu,

1382
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:56.910
they actually won't be able to apply it in real life.

1383
01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:58.570
When someone is trying to resist or when the,

1384
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.550
the technique isn't exactly what they expected or it's with a person that has a

1385
01:30:02.551 --> 01:30:06.900
different body size than what you're used to dealing with.
You have to

1386
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:13.590
encourage and you have to train for creativity and adaptation.

1387
01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:18.090
Again,
something that the military can sometimes overlook.

1388
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:20.490
Jujitsu people can sometimes overlook it.

1389
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:24.240
You have to train for creativity and adaptation.

1390
01:30:24.241 --> 01:30:25.890
So if you're going to drill,

1391
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:28.710
don't just drill the way you think it's going to be drilled,

1392
01:30:28.711 --> 01:30:32.740
a strange variations that it could possibly be.
You know you're,

1393
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:33.660
what else is a good way to do this?

1394
01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:37.860
You fight using an imposed restrictions on yourself.
So Hey,

1395
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.940
the only thing I'm going to submit you in is a Omoplata.

1396
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:45.330
So even if the guillotines wide open,

1397
01:30:45.331 --> 01:30:48.810
I've got to give that up and throw in a little pot on you.
It's going to make me,

1398
01:30:48.811 --> 01:30:53.100
it's going to force me to be creative to bring about the different position

1399
01:30:53.101 --> 01:30:57.750
that's not so obvious.
Rolling with different people.
Better than you,

1400
01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:03.090
worse than you.
The same as you,
bigger than you,
or smaller than you.

1401
01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:06.840
Taller than you.
Shorter than you.
Every different variation.

1402
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.440
When you're working standard operating procedures in the field,
guess what?

1403
01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:14.190
You want to put yourselves in different positions.
Mix the squat up.

1404
01:31:14.191 --> 01:31:16.980
Mix The platoon up,
put guys in different locations.

1405
01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:21.900
Then you want to get contacted.
You know what?
Contact Front,
contact,
left contact,

1406
01:31:21.901 --> 01:31:23.670
right,
contact rare.
Those are the basics.

1407
01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.710
Guess where you're actually getting your contacted from,

1408
01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:30.690
you're going to get contacted from the right rear and at the same time another

1409
01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:35.070
guy over on the left a little bit.
So that's what you want to Joe.

1410
01:31:35.071 --> 01:31:38.850
You want to get that creativity working because things are not going to go as

1411
01:31:38.851 --> 01:31:43.620
you expect them to go.
So yes,

1412
01:31:43.650 --> 01:31:47.070
standard operating procedures are important in anything that you do in a

1413
01:31:47.071 --> 01:31:49.710
business.
But in a business like you have a,
again,

1414
01:31:49.711 --> 01:31:51.030
we've been talking about sales today,
you have a,

1415
01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:55.320
you have a standard thing that customers are going to say when they call you and

1416
01:31:55.321 --> 01:31:58.440
you can drill through all the standard responses that you're going to give them,

1417
01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:03.520
but you also have to drill your people against a customer that you have no idea

1418
01:32:03.521 --> 01:32:06.670
that's acting crazy or that has a point that you've never dealt with before.

1419
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:11.650
You know any of those responses.
That's what you want to deal with your,

1420
01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:13.420
you're in any business,

1421
01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:17.260
things are not always going to go perfect the way you want them to go.

1422
01:32:17.261 --> 01:32:21.640
So you got to drill your leadership so they can handle the adaptations that they

1423
01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:24.130
can be creative and still figure out solutions.

1424
01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.720
So it seems like get good at the sop stuff.

1425
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.220
Like I know in Jujitsu you just get really good at it at the sop stuff,

1426
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.910
but instead of practicing sop in Jujitsu,

1427
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:41.770
just be mindful of of Sop re a lot all the time.

1428
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:45.520
Be Mindful of it.
Yeah,
and I had a guy on Twitter ask the other day,
you know,
hey,

1429
01:32:45.521 --> 01:32:49.120
I'm,
I'm in the basic,
I can't make it to the beginners classes,

1430
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.840
so I'm only in the advanced classes and now we're not drilling anything.

1431
01:32:52.841 --> 01:32:56.950
I'm not making progress.
And he's saying,
should I keep training

1432
01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.490
brother?
Keep training.
Definitely keep training.

1433
01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.530
But I think more important is just you don't have to,

1434
01:33:05.531 --> 01:33:07.150
you can,
you can find the time to Joel and your own.

1435
01:33:07.151 --> 01:33:10.600
I mean that's a mountain scape.
Look it up on Google,
look it up on Youtube,

1436
01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:11.613
see the mount escape.

1437
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:16.150
If that's a basic that you want to work on and then grab your girlfriend and
say,

1438
01:33:16.151 --> 01:33:19.540
here is shit on me like this.
I'm going to do some movements with my hips.

1439
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.330
It might seem awkward at first,
but I'm going to do it anyways,
honey,

1440
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:25.840
and then do it.
That's drilling,
you know?
Or once you get to class,

1441
01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:28.960
show up to class or stay class a little bit later.
Spend 10 minutes,

1442
01:33:28.961 --> 01:33:32.280
Jill and amount of scape 10 spend five minutes doing an arm lock.

1443
01:33:32.281 --> 01:33:35.710
Such a how many on walks can you do in five minutes?
I mean,

1444
01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:38.860
you can do enough to drill.
Trust me,
you don't need to drill for half an hour.

1445
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.740
So just know the movements,

1446
01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:45.580
learned to movements and then just go in and do a little bit of drilling and

1447
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:46.414
you'll get there.

1448
01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.020
But even if you didn't do that and you just rolled and you took the advanced

1449
01:33:50.021 --> 01:33:51.400
class and you learn the advanced moves,

1450
01:33:51.401 --> 01:33:53.510
eventually you're going to figure out the other stuff too.
It's,

1451
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.900
it's like being immersed in a language,
you know?

1452
01:33:56.050 --> 01:33:59.860
Just because you went and got immersed in a kindergarten class doesn't mean you

1453
01:33:59.861 --> 01:34:02.860
would learn faster than if you got immersed in a,

1454
01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:05.200
in a real life college,
you know,

1455
01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:09.950
or open just normal life situation.
Yeah,

1456
01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:11.740
yeah,
that's true.

1457
01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.140
So if you get good at these standard operating procedures and you can remind

1458
01:34:17.141 --> 01:34:20.860
them all the time and at the same time like how you were saying you exercise

1459
01:34:20.861 --> 01:34:24.910
your creativity,
then you can,
you can stick to them.

1460
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:29.680
But at the same time you can know when to break the rules so to speak.

1461
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.500
You know?

1462
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:35.230
Well Dean Dean is really good with some of the basic movements,

1463
01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.330
you know,
like he's really,

1464
01:34:37.331 --> 01:34:40.570
really good in them and he can almost forced them.

1465
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:44.830
Whereas Jeffy Glover,
he's really good at the basics too,
but he,

1466
01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:48.970
he's more in my mind,
he's more apt to do something creative.

1467
01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:54.540
Whereas Dean is like so good with the fundamentals that he doesn't even have to

1468
01:34:55.391 --> 01:34:59.420
be creative sometimes.
Of course he is also very creative.
That's why he's uh,

1469
01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.460
you know,
done so well in the world.
But both those guys have crazy,

1470
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:06.170
I mean any dentist,
Dean and Jeff,

1471
01:35:06.171 --> 01:35:11.171
but any really good Jujitsu player is going to be awesome at the basics and then

1472
01:35:11.541 --> 01:35:14.210
they're going to be creative.
That's what makes a Jujitsu champion.

1473
01:35:14.410 --> 01:35:18.730
<v 3>Yup.
Yup.
I actually,
Jeff has this,</v>

1474
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:23.410
this drill that he,
he got crazy drills.
He just thought it up on the spot too.

1475
01:35:23.411 --> 01:35:27.220
It seemed like he did,
but I don't know.
But it's,
it's basically you,
he'll be,

1476
01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:28.930
he'll be like,
he'll,
he'll yell out of position.

1477
01:35:28.931 --> 01:35:31.570
Then you've got to get to that position.
Kind of the,
not the fastest,

1478
01:35:31.571 --> 01:35:34.990
like oh the quickest you can do it physically it's more like the,
the,

1479
01:35:34.991 --> 01:35:37.660
with the least steps,
you know?
So if you're like,
hey,

1480
01:35:37.661 --> 01:35:41.590
half guard now do a knee bar now do,
or he'll say a submission,
he'll say a,

1481
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.280
I'm a different position and it'd be like half guard now.
Take us back now.

1482
01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:49.180
You know?
And you have to like,
well how do I take you guys back from half guard?

1483
01:35:49.181 --> 01:35:50.530
And you have to kind of,
you know,

1484
01:35:50.531 --> 01:35:54.310
so it exercises not only your creativity but thinking fast with this,
you know.

1485
01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:56.530
So after a while you start to be like,
oh,

1486
01:35:56.710 --> 01:36:00.100
I didn't know there was a knee bar from here with only like two steps,
you know,

1487
01:36:00.101 --> 01:36:03.190
that kind of thing.
And I was like,
Dang,
I really like that drill.
And he was like,

1488
01:36:03.191 --> 01:36:04.000
Hey,

1489
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.500
<v 4>yeah,
and dean,
one Dean's trolls.
Dean,
we'll have,
Dean does this same thing.</v>

1490
01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:10.750
He'll just call out,
but he'll call out like a leg.

1491
01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.990
He does it with me with leg positions.
Yeah.
He'll be like,
you know,

1492
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:18.820
for 11 didn't outside then Cochrane Aiko and he'll just go through and we'll

1493
01:36:18.821 --> 01:36:20.110
just sit there and do them.
Right.

1494
01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:23.890
And what's cool about it too is you get to learn like little defenses.
Oh yeah,

1495
01:36:23.891 --> 01:36:27.430
yeah.
Oh,
so you're doing it depending,
not,
not hardcore defense,

1496
01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:31.300
but you're making that little adjusting,
being mindful.
Yes.
Yes.

1497
01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:37.210
So yes,
slps learn them drill,
but be creative.

1498
01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:41.780
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah man,
it seems like that's a 100% translation right there.</v>

1499
01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:46.070
Like you know that kind of like hundred bro and go to the sop when in doubt,

1500
01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:50.570
if you're in someone's garden,
he's a wild,
it's like go to sop,
mind your base,

1501
01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.670
mind,
your posture,
mind your,
your elbows or whatever.

1502
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:56.100
There's like all these things that went into it.
You do it.

1503
01:36:56.130 --> 01:37:00.860
It is a 100% translation.
Yeah,
it's 100% yeah.

1504
01:37:00.861 --> 01:37:03.590
That's crazy.
Next question Jocko.

1505
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:09.020
When does asking for input up and down the chain of command as discussed in

1506
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:13.040
episode 26 hinder the leader's ability to make timely decisions,

1507
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:15.590
especially when gaining the initiative is critical.

1508
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.901
<v 4>So yeah,</v>

1509
01:37:18.901 --> 01:37:23.901
this is a question that I asked and I got an answer for you Tj who asked the

1510
01:37:24.631 --> 01:37:28.410
question when you are you okay?

1511
01:37:28.411 --> 01:37:30.840
So the situation is a little bit different.

1512
01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:35.160
If you're in an administrative situation or you're on a planning situation,

1513
01:37:35.161 --> 01:37:38.160
meaning neither one of those are restricted by time.

1514
01:37:38.610 --> 01:37:43.610
Then of course get the input and by getting the input of course your first of

1515
01:37:45.451 --> 01:37:48.570
all,
your plan becomes better because you're getting input from people,

1516
01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:51.720
you have more brains working on it.
You also,
when you get input,

1517
01:37:51.721 --> 01:37:55.650
you're building a little bit of a relationship.
You're building relationship,

1518
01:37:56.850 --> 01:37:58.230
the relationship,
what,
what?

1519
01:37:58.231 --> 01:38:03.231
Our relationships are based on trust and so trust is a requirement inside of

1520
01:38:03.241 --> 01:38:07.500
leadership.
So
that's what you want to do.

1521
01:38:07.530 --> 01:38:12.240
If you have the time and it's administrative scenario or you got the time to

1522
01:38:12.241 --> 01:38:15.030
plan,
then just go ahead and take the time to plant,

1523
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.190
take the time to get the input.

1524
01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:22.580
Now there are situations where you don't have time to discuss or debate a

1525
01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:28.080
decision and there's,
you know,
or times where maybe you have time,

1526
01:38:28.081 --> 01:38:33.081
but it's going to affect or impact the ability to make an immediate execution,

1527
01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:37.590
which is what oftentimes you're looking for.

1528
01:38:37.710 --> 01:38:41.070
You want to gain the initiative and sometimes gaining the initiative takes

1529
01:38:41.071 --> 01:38:46.071
precedence over gaining consensus from everybody and,

1530
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:52.920
and it takes precedence over coming up with the best possible plan cause we want

1531
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:53.940
to do the best possible plan,

1532
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:57.810
but sometimes fast action is going to take precedence over that.
And,

1533
01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:03.080
and patents said something along the lines of a good plan executed now is better

1534
01:39:05.371 --> 01:39:09.210
than a perfect plan executed sometime next week.

1535
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:14.610
So what happens is in those situations,
yeah,

1536
01:39:14.611 --> 01:39:16.470
you're going to have to make the call,
you're going to have to be decisive.

1537
01:39:16.471 --> 01:39:17.940
You're going to have to make the decision.

1538
01:39:18.150 --> 01:39:23.150
And because you've built trust with your team,

1539
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:28.350
then when you do need to make that call,

1540
01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:32.340
it won't be that big of a deal and people will execute it.
Now,

1541
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:34.630
I've told this,
I've said this before,
you know,

1542
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:37.100
Lafe and I were having a conversation with,
with some of our clients and,

1543
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.950
and as they were kind of talking about the same thing about,
you know,

1544
01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:45.320
giving people orders and they're not listening and what do you do?
And,
and,

1545
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:47.510
and I asked leaf in the middle of thing,
I said,
hey,
leave,

1546
01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.400
how many times did I tell you,
hey leaf,
this is a command.

1547
01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:54.210
I'm telling you to do it.
I'm ordering you because you work for me.
Do it now.

1548
01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:57.780
And Lafe was like zero times.

1549
01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:01.740
Now that being said,

1550
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:08.070
that being said,
although I never in an administrative warrant,

1551
01:40:08.071 --> 01:40:10.290
a planning situation ever said late,

1552
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:13.740
you will do this now I'm ordering you because I am the senior man and the

1553
01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:14.574
situation

1554
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:21.080
in tactical situations where we were in the field and we had to do things,

1555
01:40:21.211 --> 01:40:25.980
we had to make things happen quickly.
I definitely said things to him and said,

1556
01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:30.030
hey,
go do this now.
Like I would said,
you know,

1557
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:34.380
take that building down over there.
Hey,
move the Humvees over here or whatever.

1558
01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.590
And he would do it because he knew we didn't have time to discuss it.

1559
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:41.340
Now what's interesting about that is it didn't just,

1560
01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:45.570
it wasn't just me that was telling Lafe sometimes Lafe was saying to me,
Jocko,

1561
01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:47.400
get the Humvees moved over here,
or Jocko,

1562
01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:50.190
you need to get the element up on that high ground over there.
And you know what?

1563
01:40:50.191 --> 01:40:52.860
We had trust,
we had a relationship and I did it.

1564
01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:55.720
Even though I was senior to him.

1565
01:40:56.830 --> 01:41:00.550
We didn't care who was senior to who.
That wasn't the important thing.

1566
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:03.760
He saw something.
He was making a tactical decision.

1567
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:07.750
I knew he wouldn't be telling me to do something unless he needed to have it

1568
01:41:07.751 --> 01:41:11.590
happen.
Right?
So if he told me,
hey,
move the vehicles down the road,
I'd be like,

1569
01:41:11.591 --> 01:41:15.840
Roger Moving.
And,

1570
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:17.860
and that doesn't mean that we're,

1571
01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:21.640
if you take us to a situation where we have the time to debate,

1572
01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:24.760
like he would call me up and say,
Hey Jocko,

1573
01:41:24.761 --> 01:41:27.250
I think it might be a good idea to push the vehicles down the road.
Oh,
why?

1574
01:41:27.251 --> 01:41:28.300
What's going on?
Well,

1575
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:31.150
we're starting to see some movement out in the hinterland over there.
Okay,

1576
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:34.090
got it.
I'm going to track it.
I'm going to push two vehicles down there.
Cool.

1577
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:36.190
Right?
That's a normal conversation.

1578
01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.740
But if all of sudden there was gunfire and life was like pushed the vehicles

1579
01:41:38.741 --> 01:41:42.190
down the road to the north,
I'd say doing it.
You know what I mean?

1580
01:41:42.250 --> 01:41:47.250
So there are definitely times where you don't want to sit there and sit around

1581
01:41:47.891 --> 01:41:51.820
and debate and figure out what the best plan is that at the time where the

1582
01:41:51.821 --> 01:41:55.900
leader or the follower or the person who has the most vision of the situation,

1583
01:41:55.901 --> 01:41:59.740
it needs to make a call and make it happen.
So again,

1584
01:41:59.741 --> 01:42:02.860
the more the better relationship you have,
the easier this is going to be.

1585
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:06.730
Cause you're going to have that little mental unification of the commander's

1586
01:42:06.731 --> 01:42:09.130
intent and of the task and purpose.
And you're going to,

1587
01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:14.350
you're going to be able to be thinking along the same path.

1588
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:18.970
And when you're doing that,
everything gets a lot a hell of a lot easier.

1589
01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:24.640
So when you got the time to take the input,
take the input,
have the debate,

1590
01:42:24.641 --> 01:42:28.870
have the discussion that builds the relationships so that when it comes time to

1591
01:42:28.871 --> 01:42:33.460
be decisive and give a command and you can give it and people react up and down

1592
01:42:33.461 --> 01:42:37.090
the chain of command without a bunch of hesitation and you can go back in later

1593
01:42:37.091 --> 01:42:40.240
and say,
hey,
here's what I was talking about,
here's why we needed to do this.

1594
01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:45.700
Nope,
that's it.
And then that trust is so critical.

1595
01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:50.310
Yeah.
Like so are you saying build that relationship or whatever.
You know,

1596
01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:53.620
even at the time where it seems valuable shirt trust,

1597
01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:57.790
but it's times like this where that trust is going to shine even more.
You know,

1598
01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:59.220
when you can just say do it.

1599
01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:02.050
You don't even have to say why didn't do it cause you just know.

1600
01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:05.050
You know it's a good reason.
You know?
You know,
while we're on this subject,

1601
01:43:05.051 --> 01:43:08.950
I will tell you this as well because the more time you spent,
if you,

1602
01:43:08.951 --> 01:43:11.860
if I was always giving orders to everyone and not actually discussing,

1603
01:43:11.861 --> 01:43:15.400
I was just ordering everyone to do everything all the time.
You're,

1604
01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:20.410
you're burning up your leadership capital.
Like when I,
we,
you know,
when we're,

1605
01:43:20.411 --> 01:43:24.100
when we're out in the field and when I was out in the field with a bill tunes,

1606
01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.370
I sell them,
gave an order over the radio because I wanted my guys to lead.

1607
01:43:30.850 --> 01:43:33.100
When I did say something,

1608
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.190
that guys would just do it because it was me.

1609
01:43:36.191 --> 01:43:38.680
And they knew that if I was saying it was something had to be done,
right.

1610
01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:42.790
So if I said,
hey,
everyone getting building fort 34 now,
Gosh,
to be okay,

1611
01:43:42.791 --> 01:43:44.430
we're going to it for everyone,
we'll get there.
Right?

1612
01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:48.340
Whereas if I was trying to give orders the whole time on every operation,

1613
01:43:48.341 --> 01:43:51.230
on every little thing and every little detail,
eventually you're just there.

1614
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:52.581
What is it,

1615
01:43:52.581 --> 01:43:55.550
the boy that cried wolf and you want to give every order and people stop

1616
01:43:55.551 --> 01:43:56.384
listening to you.
Yeah.

1617
01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:59.150
Even though we're in the military and even though there's a chain of command and

1618
01:43:59.151 --> 01:44:00.410
even though they're supposed to listen to me,

1619
01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:04.850
you abused that thing and people will stop listening to you.
The less you,

1620
01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.200
the,
the more you talk,
the less people listen and the less you talk,

1621
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:10.070
the more people listen.

1622
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.760
So I reserved my actual directives in the field to be the most important things

1623
01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:18.560
that I needed.
And if I didn't have to say it,
I wouldn't,

1624
01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:22.400
I would let my troopers lead,
let my leaders,
my subordinate leadership lead.

1625
01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:26.720
I wanted them to
quality,
not quantity.

1626
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:29.690
Affirmative.
Next question.

1627
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:33.920
Many vets are getting out of the military and going back to college,

1628
01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:37.220
myself included or to college for the first time.

1629
01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:39.110
What advice do you have?

1630
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:45.530
I like how you're doing sort of like the newscasters thing when you get done

1631
01:44:45.531 --> 01:44:48.290
with the question,
keeping it too.
I liked that.
I liked that.

1632
01:44:48.291 --> 01:44:50.510
So you're going to college for the either back to college.

1633
01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:55.520
You're had been in the military.
Okay.
Number one out of the gate.
Crush it.

1634
01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:58.280
That's what you should do in college.
You should crush it.

1635
01:44:58.281 --> 01:45:00.800
You should study hard and you should crush it.

1636
01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:07.460
Now,
in order to do that,
you got to get a mindset because guess what?

1637
01:45:07.461 --> 01:45:09.260
You're going to think when you get out of the military.
You'd be like,
oh,

1638
01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:12.350
this is no big deal and all of this does.
This.
Doesn't matter.
You can be like,

1639
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:16.760
Hey,
I was in,
I was in Iraq eight months ago,

1640
01:45:16.761 --> 01:45:20.840
or I was in Afghanistan six months ago and now you're sitting here,

1641
01:45:20.841 --> 01:45:24.650
tell me to read a book and write down words on a piece of paper.

1642
01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:29.060
This doesn't matter.
That's an easy,

1643
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:34.730
that's an easy path to go down.
It's pretty easy said.
You know why?

1644
01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:40.120
Because it's actually true and what you did in combat has more gravity and more

1645
01:45:40.731 --> 01:45:44.420
consequence than anything you're going to do in college,

1646
01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:49.070
and if you want to go down that path and be,
this stuff doesn't matter.

1647
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:53.360
This isn't important compared to what I've done,
so I'm going to blow it off.

1648
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.080
That's a path you can go down if you want to.
I don't recommend it.

1649
01:45:57.081 --> 01:46:01.850
What I recommend you doing is straight up crushing college.
That's what I meant.

1650
01:46:01.851 --> 01:46:05.300
Recommend you doing?
How do you do that?
Because everybody,

1651
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.310
if you make that decision that you want to crush it,

1652
01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:11.300
if you want to make the decision that you're going to prove to people that,

1653
01:46:11.301 --> 01:46:14.540
you know what?
Yeah,
I was overseas,
I was in combat.

1654
01:46:14.541 --> 01:46:16.790
Now I'm coming back and your little games that you're playing,

1655
01:46:16.791 --> 01:46:21.290
I'm going to beat you in your own games.
So how do you do that?
Number one,

1656
01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:28.070
do the reading that you get assigned to do the assignments that you get tasked

1657
01:46:28.071 --> 01:46:31.550
with.
Do everything.
Let that be your new job.

1658
01:46:33.050 --> 01:46:36.290
These silly little games that they're putting.
Let that be your job.

1659
01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.600
Just like I was talking about ocs when I went to ocs,

1660
01:46:38.630 --> 01:46:41.900
I made that like a game for me that I was going to win.

1661
01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.530
So do that with college and then on top of that,
make it a game.

1662
01:46:48.531 --> 01:46:53.520
Yes,
but on top of that as a deeper commander's intent,

1663
01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:56.520
make it that you're going to not just do well there as a game,

1664
01:46:56.521 --> 01:46:58.290
but you're going to do well so you can get smarter.

1665
01:46:59.610 --> 01:47:04.610
So you can really actually learn information that's going to make you a better

1666
01:47:05.251 --> 01:47:07.410
person and give you better

1667
01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:13.830
ability to dominate in the world of,
that's what you should be doing in college.

1668
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:15.870
Now,
these kids that you're going to be going to college with,

1669
01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.740
they're not going to have this attitude.
They're going to be,
you know,
hey,

1670
01:47:19.741 --> 01:47:23.820
what do I need to do to get by?
What's Sally doing tonight?

1671
01:47:23.821 --> 01:47:27.810
I'm more concerned about that than I am about going out dominating this course

1672
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:32.610
so that I can get an a so that I have knowledge so I can go and crush some,

1673
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:35.460
some vocation later on in life.

1674
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:40.440
So don't just do it as a game.
You gotta play the game a little bit.
I mean,

1675
01:47:40.441 --> 01:47:43.760
you've got to go.
For me,
I get the game mentality going,
but I'm,

1676
01:47:43.761 --> 01:47:47.890
the game mentality is a rooted in something deeper and what it's rooted,

1677
01:47:47.891 --> 01:47:51.930
it is gaining knowledge to be smarter and better as a human.

1678
01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:57.030
Now a couple things about college and the actual tactics,

1679
01:47:57.031 --> 01:48:00.750
techniques and procedures to dominate.
Because when I went to college,

1680
01:48:00.930 --> 01:48:04.770
I did dominate and when I went to high school,

1681
01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:08.130
I did not dominate,
went on to high school.
I didn't care about high school.

1682
01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.920
I was like,
whatever,
I've waiting,
can I go in the military?

1683
01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:17.070
Like can I go now?
So,
but when I went to college,
I had a new attitude,

1684
01:48:17.071 --> 01:48:19.130
which was,
I'm going to dominate.
I'm an almond,

1685
01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:22.500
a battle against these people here,
I'm going to meet them.

1686
01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:25.400
So there's some of the things that are important.
Number one,

1687
01:48:25.410 --> 01:48:26.970
college is all about time management.

1688
01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.420
Getting ahead of the curve because it's so easy.

1689
01:48:31.050 --> 01:48:32.730
That's what happens with kids in college.

1690
01:48:32.731 --> 01:48:36.840
That's why they don't do well because for the first time there's no one tracking

1691
01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:39.300
them.
No one's imposing discipline on them.

1692
01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.280
You have to have in order to do well in college,

1693
01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:44.460
you have to have self discipline because no one's going to tell you to start

1694
01:48:44.461 --> 01:48:46.140
that paper that's doing six weeks.

1695
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:51.240
No one's going to tell you to start it tomorrow.
You can just blow it off.

1696
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:55.110
You can blow it off for five and a half weeks and then you've got to write a 30

1697
01:48:55.111 --> 01:48:58.080
page paper in two days and it's going to,
it's not going to be quality.

1698
01:48:58.470 --> 01:49:00.630
No one's going to ask do you,
have you done your homework before dinner?

1699
01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:04.290
That's right.
So you need to get the time management going.

1700
01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:06.780
You need to get a discipline time management schedule.

1701
01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:11.190
You need to get ahead of the curve as early as possible.
Right.

1702
01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.550
You know when you want to ruin a paper's due,
a 30 page paper due,

1703
01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:17.430
you need to write it in chunks and it makes it so easy.

1704
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:19.500
I mean it was a joke when I was going to college,

1705
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.570
I would have my papers completely done like a week out,

1706
01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:26.161
like a week out.

1707
01:49:26.161 --> 01:49:30.510
I would be done with a 30 page paper and then I would just be reviewing it and

1708
01:49:30.511 --> 01:49:35.360
getting it all completely dialed and I'd turn it in two days early and then move

1709
01:49:35.361 --> 01:49:39.230
on to the next one.
Same thing with studying.
You don't want to study you.

1710
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:42.150
You do want to study hard right before the day of the test,

1711
01:49:42.151 --> 01:49:45.330
but you want to have knowledge already absorbed in there so you wanna,

1712
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:47.070
you wanna study leading up to that.

1713
01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:51.700
When you do reading that I talked about highlight,
breakout,
the highlighters.

1714
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:54.730
That's what I do in all these books that were hammering through right now,

1715
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:56.430
we don't always,
I always send out pictures.
Some,

1716
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:58.030
they're all highlighted and marked up.

1717
01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:00.430
That's how I'm getting the good information out of them.

1718
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:05.920
So highlight and then another little trick is to make the flashcards I used to

1719
01:50:05.921 --> 01:50:08.410
highlight and then I would make flashcards about what I highlighted.

1720
01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:13.630
Turn everything into a question and then you go through the flashcards and

1721
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.460
you're going to,
you're going to memorize stuff.
Hmm.
Oh,

1722
01:50:18.461 --> 01:50:22.120
here's the big one.
This is really obvious,
but guess what?

1723
01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:26.140
People don't ask questions.
Ask questions.

1724
01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:30.400
I used to raise my hand.
I would sit in the front row.
First of all in college,

1725
01:50:30.401 --> 01:50:35.200
I sat in the front row.
I was 20 what was I 20 I think it was 27 or 28 years old.

1726
01:50:35.201 --> 01:50:36.034
Going to college,

1727
01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:41.190
I would sit in the front row in the little desk and I looked like Arnold

1728
01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:42.370
Schwarzenegger and like a Little Kid's desk.

1729
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Then I'd raise my hand all the way up like all the way up over my head and

1730
01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:50.100
they'd be looking at me,
you know,

1731
01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:52.060
cause in college they kind of stopped raising their hand.

1732
01:50:52.061 --> 01:50:57.061
But I did it anyways just to be be you just to be,

1733
01:50:57.770 --> 01:51:02.140
just to do it.
So I'd raise my hand.
But you ask questions cause guess what?

1734
01:51:02.141 --> 01:51:04.270
The college kids,
they don't ask questions and,
and guess what?

1735
01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:07.330
Adults don't ask questions,
why don't ask questions cause they got an equal.

1736
01:51:07.331 --> 01:51:12.220
They don't want to look stupid.
I don't care.
I'm here to win.

1737
01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:17.080
Exactly.
Oh you don't think I'm smart?
Let's check out the GPA homeboy.

1738
01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:17.973
You know what I'm saying?

1739
01:51:18.130 --> 01:51:22.330
So ask questions if I need and ask questions.

1740
01:51:22.331 --> 01:51:25.000
As soon as that,
as soon as the knowledge,

1741
01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:28.450
as soon as the understanding train starts to get derailed a little bit,

1742
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:30.790
ask the question right then maybe give it,

1743
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:33.820
maybe give it a minute to see if you can get it back on track by yourself.

1744
01:51:33.850 --> 01:51:37.210
But the minute you realize you're not understanding,
raise your hand and say,
Hey,

1745
01:51:37.211 --> 01:51:40.510
you know what teacher,
I don't understand that.
Can you reexplain that?

1746
01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.120
Because I'm not understanding.
Yeah,
you don't want to miss that train.

1747
01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.140
I don't want to miss the train.

1748
01:51:44.141 --> 01:51:47.670
You don't want it to go too far off course and then you're just lost.
You know?

1749
01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:51.290
So when you feel it coming off,
try and catch up real quick cause you,

1750
01:51:51.291 --> 01:51:52.810
we'll take a look and then just raise your hand.

1751
01:51:52.811 --> 01:51:54.700
Put your hand all the way up in the air.
Sit in the front row,

1752
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:59.150
put your hand all the way up in the air and look at the teacher with,

1753
01:51:59.190 --> 01:52:00.370
with a dead serious face.

1754
01:52:00.371 --> 01:52:02.500
And they're going to look at you all nervous and be like,
yes,

1755
01:52:03.250 --> 01:52:06.610
that's the only one.
I went to college,
they called me John Because,

1756
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:08.650
because that's what the attendance sheet said,

1757
01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:11.320
because my real name is John and that's what the attendance sheet said.

1758
01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:16.270
And so they'd,
yeah,
I'd be sitting there and they'd say,
yes,
John.
And I'd say,

1759
01:52:16.271 --> 01:52:20.890
yeah,
I don't understand that.
Could you reexplain it please?
Hey,

1760
01:52:20.891 --> 01:52:23.650
when they called you John,
did that fuel the fire?
No,
not at all.

1761
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:27.250
It doesn't matter to me,
but it's the only time,

1762
01:52:27.251 --> 01:52:30.550
cause I didn't know these people because normally if I'm going to work with

1763
01:52:30.551 --> 01:52:33.640
someone,
when I introduced myself,
I'd be like,
Hey,
my name is [inaudible].

1764
01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:34.870
Cause that's what everyone always calls me.

1765
01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:38.230
But these people would call my name and the tenants and I didn't want to have

1766
01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:42.250
this,
you know,
adversarial relationship.
Oh yes,
John.
That's me.

1767
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.120
The other thing is,
you know,
do some psychological warfare.
You know,

1768
01:52:47.121 --> 01:52:50.930
I would line up my pencils.
I do it on the podcast.
You boy right here,

1769
01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:55.140
I lied up pencils.
It's,
uh,
it's,
uh,
it's also getting into character.
Right?

1770
01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:56.780
You're priming.
Priming myself,

1771
01:52:56.781 --> 01:52:59.990
I'm looking at the teacher like I am so ready to take notes that if I have a

1772
01:52:59.991 --> 01:53:04.940
downed pencil it will not cost me a single letter.
I'll be back in the game.

1773
01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.020
All your contingency.
Yeah,

1774
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:12.150
contingency passes a standing by it and then so they sit in the front row,

1775
01:53:12.151 --> 01:53:13.970
line up your pencils,
have you know,
books ready,

1776
01:53:13.971 --> 01:53:17.290
personally challenged the teacher you want it to.

1777
01:53:17.410 --> 01:53:19.640
You want your personal challenge to be the pole,

1778
01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:24.440
every piece of knowledge out of them and then go beyond what they know.

1779
01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:28.880
I was,
I was,
I was competing with the teachers.

1780
01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:31.670
I was trying to learn more than they actually knew.

1781
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:35.330
And then they bring their little tests are a little exams you and you're just

1782
01:53:35.331 --> 01:53:37.800
crushed them and smash them.
Now the,

1783
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:41.330
the thing you've gotta be careful of here is this can get political,

1784
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:43.130
this can get political.

1785
01:53:43.131 --> 01:53:47.450
And if you start being offensive with the way you act,

1786
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:50.990
if you start to rubbing it in their face,
then guess what?

1787
01:53:50.991 --> 01:53:54.980
That can affect your grade.
And part of the game here is to get a good grade.

1788
01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:58.490
So you actually,
it's a time for you to start building your relationship,

1789
01:53:58.491 --> 01:53:59.720
building skills,

1790
01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:03.080
time to start building your leadership skills because you're gonna start

1791
01:54:03.081 --> 01:54:05.390
manipulating the teacher,
right?

1792
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:10.640
You want to make them think that you're actually super interested in no stupid

1793
01:54:10.641 --> 01:54:14.870
crap class that they're teaching.
I want them to think that not all.
Now,

1794
01:54:14.871 --> 01:54:16.250
some classes you're gonna love and they're going to,

1795
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:21.430
you're going to learn a lot from like if you're into English and you get to take

1796
01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:25.400
advanced grammar and syntax,
you're going to be sitting in there like,
yes,

1797
01:54:25.401 --> 01:54:28.220
this is rocks,
but there's gonna be some classes you don't want to take.

1798
01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.730
But you've got to get in there and make your teacher think that you're super

1799
01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:32.391
interested in,

1800
01:54:32.391 --> 01:54:36.080
super fired up to learn that thing and that you're not just interested in the

1801
01:54:36.081 --> 01:54:39.650
grade,
but at the same time they got to know that grades important to you do.

1802
01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:43.010
So you want to get along with them and again,

1803
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.050
go into college and if you're a veteran,
you're representing all of us out there.

1804
01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.590
So you should be going in there and just smashing college.

1805
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:55.460
And that way we have a better reputation,

1806
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:58.640
not just for being tough on the battlefield,

1807
01:54:58.641 --> 01:55:03.340
but for being smart and academically sound as well.
Yeah.
And,

1808
01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:07.100
and in a way,
if you go to college later,

1809
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:10.730
you kind of in in this weird way have an advantage.
Oh,
not even a weird way.

1810
01:55:10.731 --> 01:55:12.440
You straight up having an advantage.
Yeah.

1811
01:55:12.441 --> 01:55:15.650
Especially after you've been in the military.
Yeah.
Film much van.

1812
01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.330
Cause you've got the discipline.
Yeah.

1813
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:21.380
But the only thing that'll screw you is if you have the discipline,

1814
01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:23.870
but you don't apply it because you think all this doesn't matter.

1815
01:55:23.871 --> 01:55:26.990
This is nothing compared to combat.
That's what I started off by addressing.

1816
01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:31.330
This is important.
You just have to make an important yeah.

1817
01:55:31.590 --> 01:55:35.570
It because you pay for college and this is the part that I think,

1818
01:55:35.571 --> 01:55:38.540
well I know I just couldn't connect the dots on this.

1819
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:39.990
Even no matter how many people said,

1820
01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:44.280
I just couldn't connect the dots that you're going to,
it's worth,

1821
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:47.520
<v 3>you know,
this is,
it's all up to you.</v>

1822
01:55:47.521 --> 01:55:49.950
These people are here to give you an education and all this stuff.

1823
01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:51.240
You can do whatever you want to do.

1824
01:55:51.450 --> 01:55:52.980
You don't even have to choose a major right away.

1825
01:55:52.981 --> 01:55:55.170
You can do whatever you want to do,
you're going to have an educated occasion.

1826
01:55:55.171 --> 01:55:58.320
They do it and then to me it just didn't register.

1827
01:55:58.321 --> 01:56:02.790
It just seemed like the same thing as high school except no one was monitoring

1828
01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:06.240
your grades and there was a way a lot more going on.

1829
01:56:06.270 --> 01:56:10.830
So really it was the same thing.
You play football,
you're one of the cool kids,

1830
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.980
the cool parties on the,
you know and you,

1831
01:56:13.130 --> 01:56:16.620
but the different thing which was better than high school is you had your own

1832
01:56:16.621 --> 01:56:17.454
place to stay.

1833
01:56:18.450 --> 01:56:22.170
Other people were staying around you that were your peers that were hanging out

1834
01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:24.270
and didn't have to go to bed at a certain time.

1835
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:29.370
So if you're not that into grades and stuff in high school and you don't see

1836
01:56:29.371 --> 01:56:32.640
that clearly,
like how you would,
if you're like 27 28 years old,

1837
01:56:32.641 --> 01:56:36.630
coming back and seeing like the real value of education and college and stuff,

1838
01:56:36.930 --> 01:56:38.940
all that's going to look like is just one big party.

1839
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:42.450
Then maybe have some class or something going on during the day,
I don't know.

1840
01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:45.450
And then the,
and you make your own schedule.
You're like,
hey,

1841
01:56:45.451 --> 01:56:49.110
choose this class at this time and this side.
And you're like,
you almost,

1842
01:56:49.111 --> 01:56:49.944
it's almost like

1843
01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:55.200
<v 4>one of the biggest tests in college is if you can pass everything that you just</v>

1844
01:56:55.201 --> 01:56:58.680
talked about.
Yeah.
If you can go and you can get the discipline,

1845
01:56:58.681 --> 01:57:00.810
you can get the time management,
you can go to the classes,

1846
01:57:00.811 --> 01:57:03.510
you can study this stuff.
That's one of the tests in college.

1847
01:57:03.511 --> 01:57:06.570
And military personnel shouldn't fail that test.

1848
01:57:06.571 --> 01:57:10.140
The only reason that I'm telling you no,
no,
no.
I'm sure there's all the reasons,

1849
01:57:10.410 --> 01:57:11.870
but definitely the,

1850
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.410
the fact that they're not taking it seriously is what's going to cost like what

1851
01:57:16.411 --> 01:57:19.680
they've been through.
It's like way more impact,
more practice.
And you know what,

1852
01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:23.730
that's true.
But again,
we're not trying to,

1853
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:28.130
we want to win.
You know,
I want you,
if you're a veteran,
your listeners,

1854
01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:32.520
I want you to dominate.
And it shouldn't even be fair.
I mean,
honestly,

1855
01:57:32.521 --> 01:57:37.200
when I was going to college,
it wasn't even fair.
I mean,
because I was just ahead,

1856
01:57:37.230 --> 01:57:39.030
I was just working,
I was concentrating,

1857
01:57:39.031 --> 01:57:43.260
I was focused and I was making myself focus.
Yeah.

1858
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:46.740
And yeah,
so that's what you gotta do.
Do

1859
01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:49.730
<v 3>I remember I had this and you know what you h there's like,
you know,
there's,</v>

1860
01:57:49.731 --> 01:57:51.950
there's a smaller classes in this lecture classes.

1861
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:55.750
So I remember in the lecture class who's like criminology or something that

1862
01:57:55.751 --> 01:57:57.810
happened to be taking and there was this guy from,

1863
01:57:57.850 --> 01:58:01.070
he was basically you except a real,
like more nerdy type guy.

1864
01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:05.780
And he'd be right in the front,
not like just in the front row,

1865
01:58:05.781 --> 01:58:07.250
right here in front of the teacher.

1866
01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:10.910
And there's like a projector thing that he'd kind of,
he's right next to that.

1867
01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:13.280
And Man,
this guy,
if he had a question,
boom,
he was on it,

1868
01:58:13.281 --> 01:58:16.910
he would monopolize the whole class.
You didn't care.
And I'm in there like,
man,

1869
01:58:16.911 --> 01:58:20.240
this guy is motivated.
I don't know why,
because this is major,

1870
01:58:20.241 --> 01:58:24.710
but he's not ashamed or nothing.
And so one day we had these,
um,

1871
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:29.000
like speeches,
like you have to like read up on something and then present.
Yeah.

1872
01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:33.450
I don't remember.
I think I did it.
Maybe I did it.
I don't know.
I forget,

1873
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:36.050
but I remember when it was his turn into the auditorium.

1874
01:58:36.051 --> 01:58:38.240
So you have a little mic,
you know a teacher out of Mike,

1875
01:58:38.241 --> 01:58:40.990
he gives you the Mikey say your speech so that this,

1876
01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:46.020
it's this guy's turned to go up and the teacher gives them a my,

1877
01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:48.670
he's like,
I don't need that.
It goes,
can you guys hear me in the back?

1878
01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:53.340
And I was like,
damn,
this guy knows,
you know,
he's into this.

1879
01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:56.920
He gives his speech and he,
he might as well have been the teacher,
this guy,

1880
01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:59.950
and he was an older guy.
He was maybe like,
you know,
I'm like 18 years old.

1881
01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:04.220
It's guys like probably 25 or so.
He was a veteran,
actual or maybe men.

1882
01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:07.010
It wouldn't surprise me because this guy was there and he was there to win.

1883
01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:11.050
And thinking as an older guy,
man,

1884
01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:15.300
I wish I just had that attitude because I had the capability man,

1885
01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:17.050
the classes that I liked,
like I had,

1886
01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:20.980
I took a musculoskeletal anatomy class and I got an a and that one,

1887
01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:26.070
I think I got like 97% and I was pissed like last 3% but it's so thinking like

1888
01:59:26.411 --> 01:59:29.320
really my whole just outlook on that class,
like I was there,

1889
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:32.260
but it was a little bit different than your,
I'll straight up interested in it.

1890
01:59:32.610 --> 01:59:35.480
No.
And there was classes and I was straight up interested in too.
You know?

1891
01:59:35.490 --> 01:59:38.860
And those classes are easier to get through because you like them,

1892
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:42.910
you enjoy them.
Yeah.
But man,
that attitude of like,
I'm going,
I'm gonna win.

1893
01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:43.690
Like whatever.

1894
01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:48.190
Like the test was like this almost a way to just show off how powerful I am,

1895
01:59:48.730 --> 01:59:52.900
this little thing.
And then boom,
that was my attitude.

1896
01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:54.960
<v 4>You know?
I want one thing,</v>

1897
01:59:54.961 --> 01:59:58.050
one more thing I want to add is when I talk about concentrating me focused,

1898
01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:02.880
I would set up the time management.
You don't want to try in,

1899
02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:07.290
cause I know everybody,
everybody that's,
you know,
been overseas.
It's like,

1900
02:00:07.291 --> 02:00:10.840
oh I got trouble.
I have trouble concentrating.
Right?
So,
so,

1901
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:15.950
so what you want to do is you want to chunk down your time so you're not trying

1902
02:00:16.081 --> 02:00:20.190
to force yourself to concentrate for six straight hours.
You know,
you want to,

1903
02:00:20.191 --> 02:00:22.890
hey mom,
own a bang out an hour and a half right now.

1904
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:25.740
And I'm going to get into this,
but never going to go roll Jujitsu.

1905
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:28.320
And when I come back and we'll do another hour and a half and I'm going to do a

1906
02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:30.600
workout and I'm gonna come back,
I'm gonna do another hour,

1907
02:00:30.810 --> 02:00:33.000
they're going to hang out for a little bit,
eat some dinner,

1908
02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:37.630
and then I'm going to go and you know,
finish up and review stuff then tonight.

1909
02:00:37.650 --> 02:00:42.650
So that's one way to overcome the attention span disorder that we all have a VA

1910
02:00:46.561 --> 02:00:48.030
I can't concentrate on.
That's right out.

1911
02:00:48.210 --> 02:00:51.810
One way to overcome that is to try and do stuff for short periods of time.

1912
02:00:51.811 --> 02:00:56.760
Even when I was writing the book,
I didn't write for 10 hours at a time.

1913
02:00:57.210 --> 02:01:01.530
I wrote for an hour,
you know,
50 minutes.
But I did it every day consistently.

1914
02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:02.813
And that's how you,

1915
02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:07.050
so you want to chunk this stuff down so you don't have to sit there and focus.

1916
02:01:07.110 --> 02:01:08.010
Sometimes you have to,

1917
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:13.200
but you don't want to have to sit there and focus on something for six straight

1918
02:01:13.201 --> 02:01:18.190
hours.
It's difficult.
Yeah,
man.
Give yourself the rest.
How are you saying like,
um,

1919
02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:21.730
<v 3>and this comes from a lack of perspective.
I mean,</v>

1920
02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:24.700
to not be able to do this or to choose not to do it or whatever it comes from.

1921
02:01:24.701 --> 02:01:27.790
Again,
a lack of perspective that an 18 year old would have.

1922
02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:32.530
But going back how you can get smarter and understand that you're using that to

1923
02:01:32.531 --> 02:01:37.330
be more educated,
better person.
So if you're kind of call it gamification,

1924
02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:41.240
what you're doing is going to make this into a game,
right?
So use that like,
okay,

1925
02:01:41.241 --> 02:01:43.850
let's say I learned about whatever x,
y,
Z.
I'm going to use that.

1926
02:01:43.851 --> 02:01:44.541
What we learned today,

1927
02:01:44.541 --> 02:01:47.540
I mean he's that like on a like back to a video game where you know,

1928
02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:49.610
you choose your guy or your kid.

1929
02:01:49.611 --> 02:01:52.250
There's this game called super users trying to use it in a real scenario.

1930
02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:56.210
You had to apply in real life fully.
But I'm like,
okay,

1931
02:01:56.211 --> 02:01:57.770
there's this game called super off road.

1932
02:01:57.770 --> 02:02:01.580
You get a truck and you race and if you win you get these points to add

1933
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.400
acceleration.
You get to add turbo boost,

1934
02:02:04.401 --> 02:02:05.930
you get whatever you got to add and you only have look.

1935
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:09.990
So basically you're doing that.
So now you learn x,
Y,
Z and pick up my bone.

1936
02:02:09.991 --> 02:02:11.080
I'm an og,
got x,
Y,

1937
02:02:11.081 --> 02:02:15.290
Z in my little brain and I can take on the world with this Xyz.
I just learn.

1938
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:18.920
And you just keep it like that.
That's actually how I feel when I read now.

1939
02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.770
Not like I just learned about that like boom,
boom,
playing to,

1940
02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:24.860
and then now when I get up or whatever,
I'm like,
oh shoot,

1941
02:02:24.861 --> 02:02:27.980
I'm kinda like an upgraded person now.
Now that I know about this.

1942
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:29.630
That's what caught,
that's where,
that's great.

1943
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.800
That's a great way of thinking about it.

1944
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:35.180
College should upgrade you mentally so you have more firepower to use against

1945
02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:39.460
the world and whether they,
yeah,
and for the next class.
Yeah man.

1946
02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:44.720
And that lack of perspective.
Then when you're 18 got parties going on,

1947
02:02:44.721 --> 02:02:46.960
you're the,
you know,
you can see,

1948
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:49.220
I think you could probably follow fall into that too,

1949
02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.830
but just less likely cause after come from the military,
if you had,

1950
02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:54.860
it's like when you're 18 you're pressured to go to college this way.

1951
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.770
After high school,
everyone's stocks in the military.

1952
02:02:57.771 --> 02:03:02.060
Guys could fall into the trap of like,
okay,
but thinking about it,

1953
02:03:02.090 --> 02:03:06.290
not as likely parties of like partying and course new environment.

1954
02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.500
So seductive.
Oh absolutely.
Cause you,

1955
02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:13.020
these military guys are going to have to GI bill.
They're like roll.

1956
02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:14.390
They got a nice car.

1957
02:03:14.391 --> 02:03:17.660
Everyone else is struggling students and they're pretty much set,
right.
Popular.

1958
02:03:17.661 --> 02:03:20.410
And all of a sudden they're like,
oh yeah,
well you know,

1959
02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:22.640
they know about the world.
They've been around the world,

1960
02:03:22.641 --> 02:03:27.641
they know how to drink and they know how to party really well and so they can

1961
02:03:27.681 --> 02:03:30.650
take a leadership role in partnering with other people and they can have a great

1962
02:03:30.651 --> 02:03:32.420
time and that's cool.

1963
02:03:33.230 --> 02:03:37.160
But make sure you don't make sure you upgrade your,

1964
02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:42.060
your truck while you're there too.
It's like you're more likely when,

1965
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:45.230
especially when you make the decision kind of on your own to go back.
Yeah.

1966
02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:48.560
Like I said,
when you're 18 coming out of high school,
everyone's talking to,

1967
02:03:48.561 --> 02:03:51.710
your parents are talking about it.
Most likely kids around,
you're like,
Hey,

1968
02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:55.070
I got into this college.
Huh?
And if you're the guy who was in a college,

1969
02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:57.970
unless you have some cool other cool plan or whatever,
unless you,

1970
02:03:58.030 --> 02:04:01.010
unless you just joined the military.
Right.
But that's like another thing,

1971
02:04:01.011 --> 02:04:02.330
you know,
they,
they went to the military,

1972
02:04:02.331 --> 02:04:05.330
but what are you doing and go to college then you know,

1973
02:04:05.331 --> 02:04:08.720
unless you're going to know.
So you kind of go because you're expected to go,

1974
02:04:08.721 --> 02:04:11.760
but you don't have that clarity.
Like if you go back,

1975
02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:14.570
go back and then you hear like some people nowadays it's populated.

1976
02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:17.750
I do think though,
a lot of military guys that once they're getting out,

1977
02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:21.040
people say,
what are you going to do now?
Oh and go.
They go,
oh,

1978
02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:24.260
well I'm going to go to college and he's my Gi bill and I go,
okay,
yeah.

1979
02:04:24.261 --> 02:04:26.720
See you're going to without a,
without a focusing,
without a plan.

1980
02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:31.160
So military guys can fall into that trap as well and that's why I'm hoping that

1981
02:04:31.161 --> 02:04:32.840
they're listening to this going,
hey,
you know what?

1982
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:36.920
Absolutely take advantage of that fact that you're with a bunch of people and

1983
02:04:36.921 --> 02:04:38.250
you can hang out.
You can party

1984
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:42.980
<v 0>and have a good time,
but have the discipline that you win.
Yeah.</v>

1985
02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:47.670
None of it matters that partying doesn't mean anything if you don't win every

1986
02:04:47.671 --> 02:04:52.560
day and make yourself better and come out of there with the ability now to set

1987
02:04:52.561 --> 02:04:55.260
yourself up for a good life because that's what college is supposed to do.

1988
02:04:55.261 --> 02:04:57.440
It's supposed to give you opportunity.
Yeah.

1989
02:04:57.870 --> 02:04:59.940
That's what you want is opportunities that you can take it.

1990
02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:03.730
<v 3>Vantage of it and still a true and it's like I,</v>

1991
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:08.420
I'm thinking back to any party hangout situation.

1992
02:05:08.421 --> 02:05:11.950
It's not serving me at all right now at all.
Not One.

1993
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:16.700
And I think that was like that's what really got in the way and not partying.

1994
02:05:16.701 --> 02:05:18.800
Like I was in this big party here cause it wasn't the case.

1995
02:05:19.730 --> 02:05:24.410
The social scene we'll just pulled,
had way more of a draw than making it too.

1996
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:28.490
<v 0>Of course.
You know,
you're a human being.
You like social activity.</v>

1997
02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.830
Most human beings like that.
Yeah man.

1998
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:33.500
Not all of us considered around and be like,
no I do not.

1999
02:05:33.501 --> 02:05:34.910
Negative one is speak to other

2000
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:38.840
<v 3>people.
If I went to college for,
you know,</v>

2001
02:05:38.841 --> 02:05:42.950
if I found myself in that situation it would be just like how you said you bring

2002
02:05:42.951 --> 02:05:46.550
your a game.
Bring me every single day.
I wouldn't literally,
it'd be,

2003
02:05:46.551 --> 02:05:49.800
you know how like when you train for a tournament and you're here,
yeah,

2004
02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:52.610
guys are going at it.
That's the last thing I want to do.
I want to eat right now.

2005
02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:55.820
I'm going to rest and I can't wait to get back to training so I can learn some

2006
02:05:55.821 --> 02:06:00.240
new stuff getting better shape,
you know?
So it's like laser focus,
you know?
Yeah.

2007
02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.480
And even if it's not like focusing on the goal the whole time,

2008
02:06:02.481 --> 02:06:06.140
you're focusing on winning that day and winning the next day,
winning this week,

2009
02:06:06.170 --> 02:06:10.610
you know,
man that that's a valuable tool.
Men,
valuable advice as well.

2010
02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:15.050
Dig It.
Next question.

2011
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:21.250
Can you discuss peer leadership a bit such as during the Bolc,

2012
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:26.480
which is basic officer leader course than the army,

2013
02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:30.950
an army ranger school or other training environments without a command
structure.

2014
02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:35.270
I know you've touched on it before and said that it's probably probably the

2015
02:06:35.271 --> 02:06:36.500
toughest form of leadership,

2016
02:06:38.210 --> 02:06:41.210
but if you could discuss things that have worked well for you in any tips and

2017
02:06:41.211 --> 02:06:42.170
these environments.

2018
02:06:43.570 --> 02:06:47.230
<v 0>So pure leadership and actually whether that's harder than leading up the chain</v>

2019
02:06:47.231 --> 02:06:47.651
of command,

2020
02:06:47.651 --> 02:06:52.651
which takes the most amount of nuance and technique and savvy as opposed to pure

2021
02:06:55.991 --> 02:06:59.650
leadership,
which definitely takes a lot as well.
And there's nothing new here.

2022
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.950
Yeah.
Nothing new.
And you're trying to lead peers.

2023
02:07:02.951 --> 02:07:04.530
Just like when you're trying to lead up the chain of command,

2024
02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:06.250
who was trying to lead down the chain of command?
What are you gonna do?

2025
02:07:06.430 --> 02:07:09.040
Number one,
you gotta be humble.
You're going to listen.
You're going to lead.

2026
02:07:09.041 --> 02:07:11.500
When it's time to lead,
you're going to follow when it's time to follow.

2027
02:07:11.710 --> 02:07:13.810
Take the hard jobs.
Work hard.

2028
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:17.710
Put the priority on the team instead of yourself.

2029
02:07:17.970 --> 02:07:20.620
Accept the blame when things go wrong.

2030
02:07:20.621 --> 02:07:25.210
Give credit away to the team when things go right.
Keep your ego in check.

2031
02:07:25.630 --> 02:07:28.180
And keeping your ego in check is very important because when it comes to pure

2032
02:07:28.181 --> 02:07:31.450
leadership,
this turns into like there's a little ego struggle going on.

2033
02:07:31.451 --> 02:07:34.090
There's actually a big ego struggle coming on over the top of the whole time

2034
02:07:34.091 --> 02:07:36.280
because eat what are actually competing

2035
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.090
<v 4>with each other in some form for promotion,</v>

2036
02:07:40.091 --> 02:07:42.610
for authority,
for recognition.

2037
02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:46.870
So you're going to want that credit.
You're going to want to be recognized,

2038
02:07:46.871 --> 02:07:48.850
and those little things inside your brain.

2039
02:07:48.851 --> 02:07:51.580
If you really want to be a good peer leader,
you got to let him go.

2040
02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:55.960
You gotta let them go.
You got to stay humble.

2041
02:07:58.210 --> 02:08:00.970
Now,
for instance,
when you come up with a plan,

2042
02:08:00.971 --> 02:08:04.810
you can't get addicted to your plan.
You can't think that your plan,

2043
02:08:04.811 --> 02:08:08.500
you can't impose your plan on your peers.
You don't want to do that.

2044
02:08:08.501 --> 02:08:12.010
You want to hear other people out that in fact,

2045
02:08:12.011 --> 02:08:16.720
one way to build leadership credibility is when you become champions of other

2046
02:08:16.721 --> 02:08:19.990
people's plants and you call it,
man,
that's awesome.
I'll run with it.

2047
02:08:20.530 --> 02:08:24.580
And you take a leadership role with someone else's planned.
How cool is that?

2048
02:08:24.581 --> 02:08:28.570
They actually love you.
Then they say,
man,
Jocko doesn't have any ego.

2049
02:08:28.571 --> 02:08:31.120
He's running with the plan.
I pull it out and he's given me credit for it.

2050
02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:34.450
Of course you're building leadership,
leadership,
uh,

2051
02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:40.690
credited with that person now.
So those are all,

2052
02:08:40.691 --> 02:08:44.950
those are challenges,
right?
A lot of that,
again,
boils back to ego.

2053
02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:50.260
But the other thing is you gotta be Mentally Nimble when you're doing pure

2054
02:08:50.261 --> 02:08:54.250
leadership because you're going to be constantly shifting back and forth and

2055
02:08:54.251 --> 02:08:58.090
back and forth and back and forth between the dichotomies of leadership,

2056
02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:04.060
the things of being aggressive.
But not being overbearing,

2057
02:09:04.061 --> 02:09:05.890
being a leader and being a follower,

2058
02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:11.100
stepping up and yet not stepping on people's toes.

2059
02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:14.970
So you got to,
you got to balance those and you've got to,

2060
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.400
to be going back and forth between those all the time.
And that's what makes,

2061
02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:23.200
that's what makes peer leadership hard because if you and I are peers,

2062
02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:28.420
if I'm in charge,
you then,
then we know that.
And so I can kind of,

2063
02:09:28.690 --> 02:09:30.400
I can be a little bit more

2064
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:36.340
inactive in my balancing act because I'm in charge.
So Hey,
echo,

2065
02:09:36.341 --> 02:09:37.780
this is what we're gonna do.
You know,

2066
02:09:37.781 --> 02:09:42.760
I can be less active and balancing and eve eat.
Same thing if you work for me,

2067
02:09:42.761 --> 02:09:47.390
we know what the roles are,
your leader,
I'm following it.

2068
02:09:47.391 --> 02:09:51.250
It's that the other way around.
Um,
I'm leading in your following.

2069
02:09:51.251 --> 02:09:56.140
We know what the roles are.
We the appear.
It's just constantly balancing.

2070
02:09:56.740 --> 02:10:00.070
And if I go too strong in one direction,
I'm going to affect your,

2071
02:10:00.071 --> 02:10:03.280
I'm going to Uf,
I'm a new offend your ego,

2072
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:05.530
which is going to make you turn against me,

2073
02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:06.940
which is where all these problems come from.

2074
02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:13.840
So the,
and the biggest thing about that,

2075
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:18.870
about that balance is what makes you good at balancing it is knowing that it's

2076
02:10:19.721 --> 02:10:24.160
there.
That's what gives you the ability to balance is that you know,

2077
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:29.110
that you are balancing.
When people don't know that they're balancing,

2078
02:10:29.111 --> 02:10:31.120
that's when they're just like,
Hey,
I'm,
I'm leading,
I'm stepping up.

2079
02:10:31.121 --> 02:10:34.220
So they just lead and everyone goes,
man,
this guy's a,
he has a big ego care.

2080
02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:38.180
That's what you don't want to do.
But when you know that,
hey,

2081
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:39.980
if I'm stepping up to lead right now,

2082
02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:45.040
I need to pay attention to look around and see how people are taking it and make

2083
02:10:46.131 --> 02:10:48.710
sure that I'm getting the support to people.
And if I'm not,
then I'll go,
hey,

2084
02:10:48.711 --> 02:10:50.960
echo,
you know,
you seem to have really good important how this,

2085
02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:54.980
why don't you take this section and lead it so that people see,
oh,

2086
02:10:54.981 --> 02:10:58.370
Jockos is not trying to take control everything.
He's not a control freak.

2087
02:10:59.270 --> 02:11:00.920
That's what you want to make happen.

2088
02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:07.450
So that is in a nutshell some advice on how to lead in the peer situations fully

2089
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:13.550
in the when when you first meet someone's up here,

2090
02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:19.240
especially guys guys have this a lot where if they're even close to being you

2091
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:24.020
identity wise,
like you know within a certain age of view,

2092
02:11:24.021 --> 02:11:25.640
within a certain build of you or whatever,

2093
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:30.080
your brain goes into this like real focus mode.
S small,

2094
02:11:30.081 --> 02:11:33.230
pretty bright and it,
it wants to make a decision.

2095
02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:37.550
Is this guy my enemy?
Well my friend,
I want one of them.

2096
02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:40.940
I don't care which one,
but I just got to figure out what it is.

2097
02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:45.710
So automatically you feel sense of competition when you see a guy near you in

2098
02:11:45.711 --> 02:11:48.300
your environment.
You know like if you're,
you get,

2099
02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:49.990
you go to the gym or you go to Jujitsu.

2100
02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:55.020
Like what happens if a new guy walks in and he's about your size and he walks

2101
02:11:55.101 --> 02:11:59.910
into the Jujitsu?
Yeah,
there's arena.
There is competition assessment.

2102
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:03.500
Oh don't let them be wearing a black belt.
Oh that's even close to you.
You know?

2103
02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:06.500
Now it's like,
okay,
what does this guy,
you know,
who is this guy?

2104
02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:11.410
And then we've got something to settle,
but let's say he rolls up to,

2105
02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:15.480
and he's just so nice to you and you and then you guys roll.
He's good,

2106
02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:19.520
he gets you whatever to me.
But he's really nice.

2107
02:12:19.521 --> 02:12:22.130
He likes the same football team you like I'm saying,

2108
02:12:22.131 --> 02:12:25.870
he disarmed me by saying,
hey man,
what's going on here?

2109
02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:27.740
It's really good to meet you.
I've heard of you.

2110
02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:30.110
I know you trying with Dean lister,
Dean lister listers,

2111
02:12:30.111 --> 02:12:32.950
like one of the main guys I've always liked.
It's great to meet you Jocko.

2112
02:12:33.230 --> 02:12:35.480
I appreciate you guys letting me come to the gym,
man.

2113
02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:39.200
Love to roll with you sometime.
You know,
if you get the chance,
just,
you know,

2114
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:43.820
I know a really respect y'alls game,
right?
Yes,
exactly right.
So boom.

2115
02:12:43.821 --> 02:12:48.330
Now that decision that you like on this primal level have to make,
I made.

2116
02:12:48.331 --> 02:12:51.020
You're like,
okay,
I got you.
I mean,
you're my friend,
you're my ally.

2117
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:55.040
But you get a guy who only mad dogs,
you,
but with other calculations,

2118
02:12:55.041 --> 02:12:57.740
he's kind of the same as you.
More or less.
Yeah.
If he's mad.

2119
02:12:58.110 --> 02:13:01.850
So now this is the thing to take what you're saying,
which is 100% right.

2120
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:06.380
And folks,
this isn't just about Jujitsu,
obviously,
this is about at life.

2121
02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.610
And when you meet a person that comes into your office and they're a,

2122
02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.060
they have a role at their company or within your company or when I had another

2123
02:13:14.061 --> 02:13:16.460
company and you're meeting them for the first time and you know that there's

2124
02:13:16.461 --> 02:13:20.270
somewhere equivalent of what you're there in the EVP or they're an SVP or

2125
02:13:20.271 --> 02:13:23.320
they're a VP and you know that you are to where they are,

2126
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:25.940
a regional manager or whatever the case may be,

2127
02:13:26.150 --> 02:13:28.670
you're automatically doing an assessment.
So what do you want to do?

2128
02:13:28.671 --> 02:13:29.220
Do you want to,

2129
02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:34.040
do you want to bring them to make the friend decision or foe decision?
Right?

2130
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:37.430
Let's be leaders.
And that's the key right there.

2131
02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:41.830
Create relationships.
Not adversaries.
Yes.

2132
02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:45.910
Boar,
not adversarial relationship.
Yes.
Um,

2133
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:49.170
plant words obviously.
But yeah,
and the key there,

2134
02:13:49.171 --> 02:13:52.920
how you were saying is you want them to make the decision that you're their

2135
02:13:52.930 --> 02:13:53.763
friend.

2136
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:58.620
You're not saying you make the decision that that's your friend and you know

2137
02:13:58.621 --> 02:14:02.340
what else?
Just going to ego and insecurities.

2138
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:04.890
The more secure you are as a person,

2139
02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:08.370
the easier it is to be nice to him.
Right?

2140
02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:10.770
Like when someone comes into the gym and they're mad dog in me,

2141
02:14:11.070 --> 02:14:14.220
it's not hard for me to be like,
hey man,
what's going on?
Hey,
where are you from?

2142
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:16.650
Because I know I've been training for a long time.

2143
02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:19.560
I know that they're not gonna mop the map up with me.

2144
02:14:19.561 --> 02:14:23.180
That's not as not going to happen.
All right mate.
Thank cause I'm,
I'm confident,

2145
02:14:23.590 --> 02:14:26.700
I'm secure.
I know I've been training for a long time.

2146
02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:30.840
If I'm in a business world and I meet someone and I know that there might be

2147
02:14:30.841 --> 02:14:31.980
close to my equivalent,

2148
02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:36.270
am I insecure where I got to bow up to them and act like a tough guy?
No,

2149
02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:39.690
I'm actually confident that what I do as well,
what I do is good.

2150
02:14:39.691 --> 02:14:41.610
I know I need a good team.
I know that I'm solid.

2151
02:14:41.611 --> 02:14:44.730
I know I know my information well.
I know I'm a hard worker,

2152
02:14:44.731 --> 02:14:47.850
so why am I going to go up to him?
I got,
I'm not threatened by them.

2153
02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:51.990
It's no big deal to me.
Let's do this.
Right.
And Yeah,

2154
02:14:51.991 --> 02:14:56.580
and even if you feel though you're compelled to kind of have those feelings or

2155
02:14:56.581 --> 02:14:59.250
to do something to blow up or whatever,
cause maybe you are insecure,

2156
02:14:59.251 --> 02:15:03.360
not everyone's secure,
whatever.
Um,
just keep it on the inside,
you know,

2157
02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:06.930
don't behave like that.
Yeah.
Just know that okay,
I'm feeling this,

2158
02:15:06.931 --> 02:15:11.340
but I'm going to cause like,
because when somebody bows up to you,

2159
02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:12.780
when somebody goes up to me,

2160
02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:15.990
I don't get the feeling that they're secure and confident and I don't even get

2161
02:15:15.991 --> 02:15:18.690
the feeling that they're good.
I get the feeling like,
oh,

2162
02:15:18.691 --> 02:15:21.120
this guy's protecting something.
This guy is hiding something.

2163
02:15:21.450 --> 02:15:23.940
He must not be that good because he's intimidated by me.

2164
02:15:23.941 --> 02:15:26.730
That's why he's balling up to me.
If he wasn't intimidated by me,

2165
02:15:26.731 --> 02:15:29.640
he'd be treated me cool.
But he isn't intimidated by me.

2166
02:15:29.850 --> 02:15:31.590
So the tougher you trying to act,

2167
02:15:31.591 --> 02:15:36.450
that's actually at to a skilled kind of person that can read people.

2168
02:15:36.570 --> 02:15:40.230
The tougher you try and act,
the weaker you actually appear.

2169
02:15:41.190 --> 02:15:44.760
Now if you're running around intimidating white belts either in the business

2170
02:15:44.761 --> 02:15:48.760
world or on the g two mad,
that doesn't matter because you can wait anyways.
Yup.

2171
02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:54.060
So be intimidating the white belt.
Yeah.

2172
02:15:55.620 --> 02:16:00.240
All right.
Well yeah,
make them want to be friends with you.
That's a good one.

2173
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:03.510
I'm gonna read out me though.
Okay,
next question Jocko.

2174
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:07.980
How would you have handled the leadership role in the first world war trench in

2175
02:16:07.981 --> 02:16:12.880
the trenches?
In other words,
seemingly helpless situation.
This is,

2176
02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:17.100
this is a question that I didn't even want to answer cause it's just such a

2177
02:16:17.101 --> 02:16:22.101
brutal question and that's why I did answer it because I want to have some

2178
02:16:22.501 --> 02:16:27.480
brutal questions and I would love to think that I would have stood up like a man

2179
02:16:27.481 --> 02:16:30.100
and like I hero and donut everything in my

2180
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:35.100
<v 0>power to stop the madness and to come up with a new way and protest the few</v>

2181
02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:40.330
title tactics and raise my hand and say,
we're not doing this,
sir.

2182
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:42.970
I will not send my men to their deaths.

2183
02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:48.060
I would love to think that that's what I would have done.

2184
02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:51.180
And I can tell you when,
when,

2185
02:16:51.181 --> 02:16:55.930
when I was told to do things in Iraq that I fought,
we shouldn't be doing.

2186
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:58.900
I said,
hey,
you know what?
That's not a good idea.
Let's find another way.

2187
02:16:58.901 --> 02:17:03.220
Let's do some different.
So I know I've done that before,
but we got,

2188
02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:07.030
we got,
we had operations that we looked at and said,
you know what?

2189
02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:09.520
This is not a smart operation.

2190
02:17:09.730 --> 02:17:13.960
There's a really high risk and there's very low reward.
Let's,
let's,

2191
02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:17.350
let's not do that one.
Let's find another way to do it.
So I know I've done that,

2192
02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.080
but you take me in,
you put me in a world war one trench.

2193
02:17:23.081 --> 02:17:24.550
Now we have a different mind.

2194
02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:27.670
I have a different brain and the thing that I'm scared of,

2195
02:17:27.671 --> 02:17:32.671
the thing that haunts me is what if my mind was trapped?

2196
02:17:36.090 --> 02:17:40.920
What if I couldn't see the futility of the situation?

2197
02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:44.790
Because everyone's saying no.
You know what?
When we do this attack,

2198
02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:48.540
we've done these things and we've prepared for it and we've got more bombs.

2199
02:17:48.541 --> 02:17:52.050
We're going to drop,
we've got more artillery.
This is going to be the one

2200
02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:58.050
you just need to go over the top one more time.
Or what if I believe that?

2201
02:17:59.310 --> 02:18:04.310
What if I couldn't see this solutions in front of me?

2202
02:18:05.250 --> 02:18:09.480
And that's what scares me
is

2203
02:18:12.050 --> 02:18:17.050
what if you become so brainwashed and close minded that you cannot see any more

2204
02:18:22.521 --> 02:18:24.590
and you lose your ability to think.

2205
02:18:24.860 --> 02:18:25.693
<v 1>Mm.</v>

2206
02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.560
<v 0>And that's why all the time you're going to hear me say free your mind.</v>

2207
02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:34.150
That's what I'm talking about for your mind.

2208
02:18:34.170 --> 02:18:38.880
That is the situation that I am talking about.
Question,

2209
02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:40.380
what is around you?

2210
02:18:40.381 --> 02:18:45.381
Question the status quo and question the authority and the leadership and your

2211
02:18:45.691 --> 02:18:47.900
subordinates.
Question everything

2212
02:18:50.410 --> 02:18:55.410
in order to make sure that you're not the wing a a well worn path.

2213
02:18:58.880 --> 02:18:59.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2214
02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:05.380
<v 0>Oh well worn path that other people have gone by.</v>

2215
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:10.690
Maybe it's a path that you've walked before but it's a well worn path and it's a

2216
02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:16.780
path that leads to suffering in pain and tragedy and you can't get off the path

2217
02:19:19.011 --> 02:19:22.100
because your mind is not free.

2218
02:19:26.670 --> 02:19:27.503
So

2219
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.690
<v 1>how would I have handled the leadership situation in World War One?</v>

2220
02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:37.720
I cannot honestly answer that question but the way I try and live and the way I

2221
02:19:40.791 --> 02:19:41.900
try and think

2222
02:19:45.390 --> 02:19:48.150
<v 0>is one with an open mind,</v>

2223
02:19:48.151 --> 02:19:50.400
a free mind that can see,

2224
02:19:50.850 --> 02:19:55.850
that can see different perspectives that can detach from what's being told to me

2225
02:19:57.721 --> 02:20:00.870
and I can question it and I can come up with a diff different solution.

2226
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:05.583
Free your mind.

2227
02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:12.950
<v 1>Sound Nice to tough question.</v>

2228
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:18.470
Next question.
Jocko.
Echo.

2229
02:20:19.610 --> 02:20:24.200
Tough versus smart.
So wait,
what is this

2230
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:25.380
<v 0>do you think?
Is this like,</v>

2231
02:20:25.410 --> 02:20:29.610
is it better to be tough than smart or just in general?
Well,

2232
02:20:29.611 --> 02:20:31.650
you just read the question as it was stated.

2233
02:20:31.651 --> 02:20:36.480
It just said tough topic for podcasts.
Tough versus smart.

2234
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:39.660
And in my opinion,

2235
02:20:39.690 --> 02:20:43.500
I don't think you need to be tough versus smarter and you don't think it needs

2236
02:20:43.501 --> 02:20:47.710
to be tough or smart.
I think you need to be tough and smart,
right?

2237
02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:51.360
I don't think those two traits are mutually exclusive at all.

2238
02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:57.360
And being tough and being smart is actually what we want.
We,

2239
02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:03.000
you know,
so when we think of tough,
I think we think of using,
for instance,

2240
02:21:03.001 --> 02:21:05.460
using blunt force to solve a problem,

2241
02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:08.630
right?

2242
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:12.710
And and you might think that using blunt force to solve a problem is stupid.

2243
02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:19.170
And at the same time you might think that stepping back from a problem and

2244
02:21:19.171 --> 02:21:22.920
taking a look or stepping back away from it might be giving up.

2245
02:21:24.730 --> 02:21:29.450
So your week
or you're not tough.

2246
02:21:31.130 --> 02:21:35.030
But there are times when those options are the best options.

2247
02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:39.470
There's some times when blunt force is the best option and you just got to power

2248
02:21:39.471 --> 02:21:43.130
through and you got to be tough and you got to get over the hurdle or over the

2249
02:21:43.131 --> 02:21:46.430
obstacle or through the obstacle through blunt force trauma

2250
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:52.760
and there's other times where the best possible thing you could do is step back

2251
02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:57.230
and quit beating your head against the wall and trying to blunt force through

2252
02:21:57.231 --> 02:22:00.710
something.
You want to step back and find another way.
You want to be smarter,

2253
02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:05.030
not harder
and I think again,

2254
02:22:05.031 --> 02:22:09.590
this comes out to balance and people pushing

2255
02:22:11.130 --> 02:22:15.960
when it's a good time to push in a good time to be tough and at the same time

2256
02:22:16.050 --> 02:22:21.030
knowing that you need to balance that with being smart and the only way you're

2257
02:22:21.031 --> 02:22:22.140
going to be able to do that,

2258
02:22:22.740 --> 02:22:27.740
the only way you're going to be able to figure if you're just being too smart or

2259
02:22:28.201 --> 02:22:32.310
not smart enough or too tough or not tough enough is to be able to detach and

2260
02:22:32.311 --> 02:22:34.650
step back and look and see,
assess the situation.

2261
02:22:35.010 --> 02:22:39.450
If you get too in the weeds on it,
you won't be able to see that,
hey,

2262
02:22:39.451 --> 02:22:42.630
you've beat your head against the wall 47 times.
That's enough.

2263
02:22:42.631 --> 02:22:45.240
Stop step back and find another way.

2264
02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:51.750
Just like if you're so engrossed in solving the problem and finding the perfect

2265
02:22:51.751 --> 02:22:53.550
solution and finding the least impact,

2266
02:22:53.551 --> 02:22:58.200
wave through the smartest resolution you don't.

2267
02:22:58.230 --> 02:23:00.180
If you don't step back from that,
you might not see that.

2268
02:23:00.181 --> 02:23:02.580
If you wait any longer on your brilliant plan,

2269
02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:06.840
you're going to be overrun by the problem itself.

2270
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:12.510
So being smart and being tough or not mutually exclusive,

2271
02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:16.640
you need to be both and the way that you balance them is by stepping back and

2272
02:23:16.641 --> 02:23:20.130
detaching and doing.
Always doing an assessment of what's happening.

2273
02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:25.220
<v 3>So what if you had to choose,</v>

2274
02:23:25.970 --> 02:23:30.410
and I'm going to make the question even harder.
No specific scenario.

2275
02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:31.580
What if you had to choose?

2276
02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:36.640
You got to be either really smart but not tough or really smart or really tough

2277
02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:40.080
and not smart.
What?
What would the tooth,

2278
02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:47.620
<v 0>yeah.
Unfortunately you have to go with being smarter.
It's not unfortunate,</v>

2279
02:23:47.621 --> 02:23:48.341
but it's just the,
the,

2280
02:23:48.341 --> 02:23:52.510
the reality is being smarter is better because being smarter means you can find

2281
02:23:52.511 --> 02:23:55.280
another solution.
But you know,
the,

2282
02:23:55.310 --> 02:23:59.170
the wall that you might be banging your head against might literally be

2283
02:23:59.171 --> 02:24:02.470
impassable through that,
through that section.

2284
02:24:03.010 --> 02:24:04.900
And if all you're going to do is beat your head against it,

2285
02:24:05.020 --> 02:24:07.480
eventually you're going to,
you're going to not make and you're going to die.

2286
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:10.180
So being smart is always better.

2287
02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:14.850
<v 3>Yeah.
And a,
I guess I should add it just in life,
let's say,
you know,
the really,</v>

2288
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:19.140
the question I was wondering is like in life,
you know,
God was there and he said,

2289
02:24:19.141 --> 02:24:22.080
okay,
I'm going to be still one of these on you in just in your life.

2290
02:24:22.081 --> 02:24:26.430
You can either have a knack for being really smart,
but not tough at all.

2291
02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:30.040
Or really tough and not be as fun smart because he,

2292
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:31.360
<v 0>it's,
it's,
it's,
um,</v>

2293
02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:34.500
I shouldn't even be like making this like this is a hard decision,
right?

2294
02:24:34.501 --> 02:24:37.870
Being smarter is better beings.
Being smarter is better.

2295
02:24:38.590 --> 02:24:42.370
There's no doubt about it.
That's being smarter is better.
But by the way,

2296
02:24:42.730 --> 02:24:47.710
being smarter,
look at the human race.
Why do we rule the world over the animals?

2297
02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:51.040
I mean,
you tell me that you're tougher than a,
than a chimpanzee.

2298
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:52.280
<v 3>Well,
yeah,</v>

2299
02:24:52.281 --> 02:24:56.950
but I'm just saying the only reason that the thing that wins his intellect and

2300
02:24:56.951 --> 02:25:01.460
it will win every single time.
Well at a win a lot of the time,
a lot of the time.

2301
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:06.010
And if you're smart,
you can figure out a way to overcome the toughness.
Be Tough.

2302
02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:09.020
Yeah.
And not even that's it's called [inaudible].
Yeah,
exactly.
Right,

2303
02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:12.500
exactly right.
Like when you say,
are you to,
am I tougher than a gorilla?

2304
02:25:12.501 --> 02:25:15.310
We'll say,
well,
in a way,
yeah.
You know,

2305
02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:19.250
I mean I'm a shotgun or if I have a,
yeah.
Anything,
you know,

2306
02:25:19.251 --> 02:25:21.920
anything that I think up to build or buy,
you know,

2307
02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:24.150
because of other people like thought it up and I used

2308
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:25.900
<v 4>their knowledge,
you know,
cause I was that smart to do it.</v>

2309
02:25:25.901 --> 02:25:27.460
Which goes back to the original question to,

2310
02:25:27.461 --> 02:25:29.710
or what question we answered a little while ago about college.

2311
02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:34.340
Like go to college and improve your smartness.
Get smarter.
Yup.
Yeah.
That's why.

2312
02:25:34.341 --> 02:25:36.680
That's why we say that on the podcast.
I'm not album,

2313
02:25:36.730 --> 02:25:40.120
I'm not always talking about being stronger and faster and bigger and tougher.

2314
02:25:40.121 --> 02:25:43.150
I'm always talking about you gotta be smarter to no doubt about it.

2315
02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.370
The success I've had from my life is zero of it just about zero,

2316
02:25:48.371 --> 02:25:51.130
but has come from anything physical or being tough.

2317
02:25:51.340 --> 02:25:54.640
Now there is a mental toughness that does help you when you are doing

2318
02:25:54.641 --> 02:25:56.640
intellectual things.
I mean,

2319
02:25:56.710 --> 02:26:01.710
I can force myself to do some intellectual goals or some intellectual challenges

2320
02:26:03.250 --> 02:26:06.370
that if I wasn't,
if I didn't,
I didn't Tufts and the best word,

2321
02:26:06.371 --> 02:26:09.520
but if I wasn't mentally tough,
I won't be able to do it.
Right?
Yeah.

2322
02:26:09.550 --> 02:26:13.180
But if you're smart enough,
you're smart.
Figure out ways to get mentally tough.

2323
02:26:13.210 --> 02:26:14.080
Like if you're like,
Hey,

2324
02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:18.060
I know I'm not mentally tough and smart enough to know I'm not mentally tough or

2325
02:26:18.061 --> 02:26:20.710
I'm enough is again,
let me figure out a way to get meant.

2326
02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:23.530
I'll figure out a good workout.
Who would you rather be?

2327
02:26:23.531 --> 02:26:28.531
The guy that is really tough and can stay in cold water for 45 minutes or the

2328
02:26:28.991 --> 02:26:33.440
guy that invents a wetsuit like Jacko Neal and I can stay in the water for an

2329
02:26:33.441 --> 02:26:37.270
unlimited amount of time.
Now there you go.
Case in point,
Jack O'Neill,

2330
02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:39.720
keeping it real name dropper.

2331
02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:44.740
Next question.
I didn't say I knew

2332
02:26:46.750 --> 02:26:48.310
me and Jack,
we go way back

2333
02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:55.960
for one more maybe.
Maybe.
Uh,
okay.

2334
02:26:56.350 --> 02:27:01.060
Jocko.
As far as self improvement and getting after it goes,

2335
02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:04.990
who's standard should one measure themselves?
But

2336
02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:11.840
so who do I use as a standard to measure myself by?

2337
02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:18.260
It's,
it's really everyone

2338
02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.650
and no one

2339
02:27:23.890 --> 02:27:28.890
because there's people in the world that have skills and strength and talent

2340
02:27:29.681 --> 02:27:31.450
that I will never have.

2341
02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:33.673
<v 2>Oh,</v>

2342
02:27:35.130 --> 02:27:40.050
<v 4>bring some of these notions that you can be whatever you want to be as,</v>

2343
02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:41.880
as long as you want it bad enough.

2344
02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:47.610
Those that are not true.
There are fairy tales.

2345
02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:48.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2346
02:27:48.930 --> 02:27:51.420
<v 4>We all have limitations</v>

2347
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:57.950
and I don't have the right genes to be an Olympic weightlifting champion.

2348
02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:05.600
I don't have the right genetics to be in the Olympic champion sprinter or a

2349
02:28:07.890 --> 02:28:12.750
gymnast or whatever sport you want a name.

2350
02:28:12.751 --> 02:28:15.150
Now,
I'm sure if I trained my whole life,

2351
02:28:15.151 --> 02:28:19.710
perhaps I could have achieved some high level in those sports,

2352
02:28:19.950 --> 02:28:22.040
but I can tell you I

2353
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:27.040
<v 0>do not have the DNA to be the best in the world in those categories.</v>

2354
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:29.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2355
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:32.450
<v 0>So what does that mean?</v>

2356
02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:34.210
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2357
02:28:34.210 --> 02:28:38.530
<v 0>Does that mean that I give up?
Does that mean they're like quit?
Of course not.</v>

2358
02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:40.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2359
02:28:40.340 --> 02:28:41.173
<v 0>Not at all.</v>

2360
02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:46.910
It means that I'm going to try to be the best that I can be.

2361
02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:50.900
The strongest,
the fastest,
the smartest,

2362
02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:55.280
the smartest human that I can become.

2363
02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:00.950
That's what I'm going to go for and I will,

2364
02:29:01.010 --> 02:29:06.010
I will compare myself to others in and look at them and see what they're doing

2365
02:29:06.261 --> 02:29:09.770
and I'll say that it is possible.

2366
02:29:09.771 --> 02:29:13.130
How close can I get to that greatness?

2367
02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:16.760
How close can I get to that glory.

2368
02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:24.720
But the reality is
that my glory,

2369
02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:31.460
it doesn't happen in front of a crowd.
It doesn't happen in a stadium.

2370
02:29:31.461 --> 02:29:33.620
It doesn't happen on a stage.

2371
02:29:35.250 --> 02:29:35.920
<v 2>Okay?</v>

2372
02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:37.870
<v 0>There's no metals handed out.</v>

2373
02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:46.510
My glory happens in the darkness of the early morning

2374
02:29:48.430 --> 02:29:50.350
in solitude alone.

2375
02:29:51.940 --> 02:29:52.773
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2376
02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:53.850
<v 0>Where I try</v>

2377
02:29:55.500 --> 02:30:00.500
and I try and I try again to be everything that I possibly can be the best that

2378
02:30:03.811 --> 02:30:08.811
I possibly can be better than I was yesterday

2379
02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:16.710
in better than other people thought I could be

2380
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:24.590
faster and stronger and smarter and with one victory that no one can ever take

2381
02:30:27.661 --> 02:30:28.680
away from me.

2382
02:30:31.860 --> 02:30:36.630
A victory that is earned every single day,

2383
02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:44.760
a victory of determination and will and discipline

2384
02:30:49.140 --> 02:30:54.140
and a victory that is achieved because I will not stop.

2385
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:07.660
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2386
02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:10.080
So once again,

2387
02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:14.460
thanks to everyone for listening and downloading and supporting the podcast

2388
02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:18.400
through the various options that we have to do.
So Echo,

2389
02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:19.980
what are those options?

2390
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:22.860
<v 3>Options,
if you care about supplementation,</v>

2391
02:31:22.890 --> 02:31:27.090
the good kind that work I'm go to on it on it.
Supplements,

2392
02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:31.680
Alpha brain for your brain,
make you smarter,
make quicker decisions,
memory,

2393
02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:35.100
all that stuff.
Proven to work.
By the way,
I don't know if you knew that.
You know,

2394
02:31:35.101 --> 02:31:39.270
some,
some supplements they don't prove,
they just say,
hey,
this is what's in it.

2395
02:31:39.271 --> 02:31:42.570
That's it.
These ones are proven.
And you can even go on the website,

2396
02:31:42.571 --> 02:31:47.310
look@alltheirresearchiscoolanywayonit.com slash Jocko 10% off,

2400
02:31:56.370 --> 02:32:00.510

Like passive supporting.
It's like easy,

2401
02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:03.330
you know,
but it costs you nothing plus you.
Nothing.

2402
02:32:03.810 --> 02:32:08.760
You're actually just getting after it,
but you're,

2403
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:12.660
but you're supporting the podcast for free.
Yup.

2404
02:32:13.490 --> 02:32:15.880
Dig it yet.
That is legit.
Um,

2405
02:32:16.170 --> 02:32:21.000
or if if you like to shirts and mugs and stuff,
you know,
if you're into that,

2406
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:22.860
which I know I am.

2407
02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:27.300
Um,
they're pretty cool.
We do,

2408
02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:31.980
I do add like layers to the shirts,
you know,

2409
02:32:31.981 --> 02:32:35.820
they're not just look cool saying or discipline equals freedom.
That's it.

2410
02:32:35.821 --> 02:32:39.050
There's like more to it.
You know,
it's like you're saying need,
I don't know,

2411
02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:44.540
you know,
church to cool in my opinion,
if that's your opinion as well.
Look at it.

2412
02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:48.510
You're saying there's a whole nother level of cool to the shirts that you make.

2413
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:53.550
I think they're cool but I don't want to make it,
there you go.

2414
02:32:53.610 --> 02:32:56.820
But I don't want to be like,
hey,
they're cool.
And then people will be like,

2415
02:32:56.821 --> 02:32:58.680
you know,
they have a different opinion and not cool.

2416
02:32:58.681 --> 02:33:01.440
I don't want to be the guy pushing not cool stuff.
I think they're cool.

2417
02:33:01.470 --> 02:33:05.520
Go to chocolate store.com if you think they're cool,
good,

2418
02:33:05.521 --> 02:33:09.820
get one or two and that's also supporting the podcast and you're getting cool

2419
02:33:09.821 --> 02:33:12.930
shirt.
That's cool.
We did that.
Yeah.
And I used the,

2420
02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:15.300
actually people ask me this so it is relevant where,

2421
02:33:15.301 --> 02:33:19.740
what kind of shirts do I use?
I use the blended one,
poly poly cotton blend.

2422
02:33:19.741 --> 02:33:22.760
So they're like softer does,
there's a bunch of different kinds of,

2423
02:33:22.761 --> 02:33:26.340
is a really light one and then there's like a medium but still soft.

2424
02:33:26.341 --> 02:33:30.450
And you know,
that's the one I chose because the light one,
it's good.

2425
02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:35.250
And I liked those a lot,
but some people might not,
you know,
too late maybe.

2426
02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:39.350
Yeah,
maybe.
I Dunno,
but um,
I figured that out in,

2427
02:33:39.390 --> 02:33:42.030
but it's their dope anyway.
They're the high quality ones.

2428
02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:46.800
They're not the ballpark giveaway shirts,
you know?
Yeah,
they're good.

2429
02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:52.890
Anyway,
there you go.
Jocko,
store.com check them out for yourself and then,

2430
02:33:52.891 --> 02:33:54.000
um,
yeah,
there you go.

2431
02:33:55.470 --> 02:34:00.470
Well also you can support the podcast by reviewing it on iTunes or stitcher or

2432
02:34:00.691 --> 02:34:03.540
Google play or whatever you listen to it on.

2433
02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:06.570
And that helps promote the podcast and spread the word.

2434
02:34:06.571 --> 02:34:09.330
So take a couple minutes and write a review and I read them.

2435
02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.080
So say something cool in there and say something cool and then I'll,

2436
02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:18.040
I'll talk about it.
It'll be in my brain.

2437
02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:22.770
<v 4>So I liked that.
They don't let you respond to them on iTunes zone.
You're like,</v>

2438
02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:27.190
I can't say like,
hey man,
thanks.
Yeah.
Cause it essentially it's,
it's a review.

2439
02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:29.860
It's not like a conversation.
I know,
but it shouldn't be.

2440
02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:34.860
It should be a conversation.
So I can be like,
hey man,
thanks.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

2441
02:34:34.930 --> 02:34:37.750
yeah.
There is that,
that will be cool.
Well,
but then again,
if,

2442
02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:40.750
if people think that you're going to like respond to it,
they might not

2443
02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:45.900
say something cool.
You know what some people have done,
they've,
they've,
uh,

2444
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.090
like taking a screenshot of it and then put it on Twitter and that way I can be

2445
02:34:49.091 --> 02:34:53.320
like,
oh,
that's cool man.
That's awesome.
Appreciate it.
Or I can say,
hey,

2446
02:34:53.321 --> 02:34:57.700
good point.
Yup.
We'll,
we'll,
we'll think about that.
Yeah.

2447
02:34:57.910 --> 02:35:01.780
We'll make some adaptations,
adaptations,
perhaps,
perhaps not,

2448
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:05.290
but getting a screenshot of their iTunes review that that's a message in and of

2449
02:35:05.291 --> 02:35:09.040
itself that saying,
Hey,
I put a review on iTunes.

2450
02:35:09.130 --> 02:35:13.570
It's not necessarily,
hey,
you know,
your audio is too quiet.
You know,

2451
02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:17.920
it's not that if they wanted to tell you that,
they tell you that in Twitter.

2452
02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:23.410
Yeah.
At least they're showing,
right.
Right.
That,

2453
02:35:23.411 --> 02:35:27.430
hey this is,
this is,
this is funny cause I would like to see like some reviews,

2454
02:35:27.431 --> 02:35:31.660
like there's some people that write reviews that I laugh at because they're fun.

2455
02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:36.610
They're like,
I am definitely getting after it.
10 Nate,

2456

2458
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:51.430
That's awesome man.
So that's cool.
Appreciate that.

2459
02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:52.990
And also of course,

2460
02:35:52.991 --> 02:35:55.930
if you want to continue this conversation like we just talked about or you want

2461
02:35:55.931 --> 02:35:58.600
to ask questions or you want to give us feedback or you want to send us a

2462
02:35:58.601 --> 02:36:03.280
screenshot of your Amazon purchase or you just want to kick it with us,

2463
02:36:03.281 --> 02:36:08.170

Echo Charles is at Echo,

2464
02:36:08.171 --> 02:36:11.590
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2465
02:36:11.591 --> 02:36:15.160
We're also there with Facebook and the Instagram.

2466
02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:21.340
And we do appreciate what you do for us,
the questions or support,
the comments,

2467
02:36:21.341 --> 02:36:24.670
the fact that all of you are out there getting better,

2468
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:30.630
putting these principles to work on the battlefield in your business and your

2469
02:36:31.091 --> 02:36:34.750
personal life.
I'd seen a bunch of seal buddies that I have and they're,

2470
02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:36.070
they're into it,

2471
02:36:36.071 --> 02:36:40.140
they're listening and they're giving me feedback and that,

2472
02:36:40.330 --> 02:36:44.620
that is worth everything to me to know.

2473
02:36:44.621 --> 02:36:47.140
And I'll get a bunch of emails from marines,
from cops,

2474
02:36:47.141 --> 02:36:49.930
from firefighters that they tell me that they are putting this stuff to work.

2475
02:36:49.931 --> 02:36:53.830
I get emails from business people that they're putting this stuff to work and

2476
02:36:53.831 --> 02:36:56.450
that's what we're doing this for,
you know?

2477
02:36:56.530 --> 02:37:01.530
And so that's what inspires me to do this and keep doing this and for me to push

2478
02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:08.580
myself because you are pushing yourself out there earning that victory every

2479
02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:15.980
single day by going out there
and getting after it.

2480
02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:20.510
And so until next time,

2481
02:37:21.890 --> 02:37:25.180
this is echo and Jocko out.
