WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.180
In extreme ownership.
You talk about being close with the team,

2
00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:08.380
but not so close that they forget who's in charge or that the good of the team

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.670
suffers.
How do you overcome the isolation of leadership?

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.750
What strategies did or do you employ to avoid the isolation becoming an issue?

5
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.840
This is an example of,
I'm going to take this to the extreme.

6
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.870
Hey,
I'm not going to be too close to my people.
Guess what?

7
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.480
I'm not talking to them,
right?
I'm not going to speak to them.
I'm going to,

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.070
I gotta maintain a distance.
I got up and it's,
it's obviously not true.

9
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.830
It's obviously not true.
And I think,
you know,

10
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.850
the relationship that you and me and Seth and the,
that we all had was clearly,

11
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.600
uh,
this,
right?
I wasn't alone.

12
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.740
I wasn't isolated as the leader because we were all bros and hanging out.

13
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.310
And now did it start off like,
oh no,
you know,
I,

14
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.620
as we always talk about like our come across Hackworth style of like,
Hey,

15
00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:58.540
we're not going to joke around for at least whatever,

16
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:02.170
six to eight weeks to make sure that these dudes are good to go and that,

17
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.820
that they understand where I'm coming from and,
and that's cool.

18
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.510
But once we get through that,
okay,
like,
then it's like open up a little bit,

19
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:11.660
then it's like open up a little bit more.

20
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:14.170
And then as I've grown up a little bit more so that you're not isolated at the

21
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:17.740
top because not only is it important that you're not isolated,
that's like,

22
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.390
that's like a marginal thing.

23
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.100
What's more important is what I talked about earlier is if you,

24
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:28.750
if Lafe can't come to me and say,
hey man,
hey,
I don't agree with this plan.

25
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.650
Or more importantly,
Hey Jocko,
here's what's going on with the troops right now.

26
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.570
Here's what's going on with the mentality.

27
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:35.950
Here's what's going on with the morale.

28
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.650
If he can't knock on my door and say that to me,

29
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.230
then that's a real problem.
Because now,
um,
you know,
um,
um,

30
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.010
in the dark on what's happening inside inside with the troops,

31
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.660
which is problematic.
Yeah.
I think it's,

32
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.440
this to me sounds like a,

33
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.060
I was thinking about this question and it sounds to me like a maybe a junior

34
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:59.580
leader that was promoted at the shame cause that cause that's where you really

35
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:00.840
feel like when I go from,
you know,

36
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.780
the assistant platoon commander where I'm like kind of one of the boys and um,

37
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.170
you know,
we're,
we can,
you know,
it's kind of a,

38
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.440
I can kind of play interference with it with the officer in charge and the

39
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:12.270
platoon commander now all of a sudden I get promoted.

40
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.180
You recognize instantly there's a little bit of difference.

41
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.930
You've got to maybe kind of distance yourself slightly from where you were

42
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.940
previously and recognize when you took over.
Yeah.

43
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.460
Charlie Patina as a platoon commander,

44
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:26.000
when did you realize that you needed to transition from being one of the boys

45
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.270
until being the OIC and that there was,

46
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.240
that the gap was going to open up a little bit?
Was it as soon as you took over?

47
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.970
It was pretty quick because I'd been to buds and,

48
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:38.320
and a seal qualification training,
you know,
escuchar advanced training with a,

49
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:41.980
with several guys.
And I knew these guys very well and you know,

50
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.390
I think we had a big house party hanging out,
you know,
having a good time and,

51
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.390
and uh,

52
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.120
everybody's over at my house and all of a sudden I realized some I did all the

53
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:52.750
time,
you know,
as an assistant platoon commander and all of a sudden,
uh,

54
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.010
we're in at work,
you know,
the next week and I got to get to,
uh,
make some,

55
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.570
some tough calls and we've got to get,
you know,

56
00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:00.610
drive the a little bit higher where we're at.

57
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.970
And there's some pushback and you realize like,
okay,
when it's,

58
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.010
when it's time to give people some bad news or say,
hey,

59
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.440
we're not doing as good as we should.
We need to fix that.

60
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.350
And they kind of give you the leg,
hey bro,
you know,
what are you doing on Friday?

61
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.680
Then it's,
then you're like,
okay,
I'm going to have to,

62
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.310
I'm going to have to distance a little bit.
But he did the isolation.

63
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.370
You should never be isolated.
I think that's one thing that,
you know,

64
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.510
I remember coming into your office and,
uh,

65
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:28.090
I would come in and hang on all the time and your office,
you know,
you,
you,

66
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.900
you'd come in and hang out in the platoon space.
I mean,
I've come,
you know,
we'd,

67
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.320
we'd see each other in the gym was like,

68
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:36.340
we were always trying to find a way to like hang out and talk and,
and,
um,

69
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.320
it was even when,
you know,

70
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.740
Seth stone was all the way across the other side of the city.
I mean,
I,
you know,

71
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.590
we'd still connect with them and talk to him on the phone and once,
well,
yeah,

72
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.000
well,
I talked to him all the time on the A and DVT.
Yeah,

73
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.970
you guys do you guys talk.
But having,
but even me,
you know,

74
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.980
we'd always w he came by,
like,

75
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.470
we'd always try to try to get together and talk to each other and catch up,

76
00:03:56.471 --> 00:04:01.330
whether it's in the Chow Hall or are,
uh,
you know,
in a platoon space.
And,

77
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.420
uh,
you know,
guys,
like I've ever,
Tony would come in there,
I'd come in,

78
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.310
I'd walk in and I'd see the wind plan written up on Tacos,

79
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.740
whiteboard and tasking at bruiser or Tony had written down all the things that

80
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:16.090
we needed to do to win and robotics,
which were pretty harsh.
Yes.

81
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.480
Probably on the level like Ganga Eskom and certainly there's the con Red Planet,

82
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.490
which,
you know,
hey man,
we are as it's mirror.
We are,

83
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.180
we are joking and laughing about it.
That this is the relationship Jocko hat,

84
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.810
you know,
not only with me but with,
with other leaders in the task unit.
And uh,

85
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.330
and I think you have to have that.
I mean,
you've got to have a,

86
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.130
you've got to have a relationship with your people.

87
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.520
You can't think that I can't talk to anyone.
I can't interact with anyone.

88
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:43.570
And I think this,
you're going to be unsuccessful as a leader.
Um,
you know,
if,

89
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.940
if you try to roll that way,
it's just not gonna work.
Yeah.

90
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.750
I think where you might feel what might feel like a isolation,

91
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.900
which is definitely true.
And this is the burden of command,
right?

92
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.920
Like guess what?
You're friends with Lafe,
you're friends with Seth,

93
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:00.550
you're friends with Tony,
you're friends with these guys.
But at the same time,

94
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.000
like,
oh,
the burden of command is on you and it's going to be,

95
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.630
it's going to be you.
You're going to,
you're going to bear that,

96
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.180
right in your platoon.
It's like,
Hey,
you got your assistant platoon commanders,

97
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.460
you got your opportunity if you've got your Lpo.
But when something goes wrong,

98
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.860
if something goes wrong,
if you,
if there's a bad,

99
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.320
if something happens on a mission and it goes bad,
I'm not talking,
I'm not,

100
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.880
I'm not looking at the assistant platoon commander.
I'm,
I'm looking at you.

101
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:31.020
That's the burden of command.
That's so that thing.
Yeah,
that's,

102
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.590
that there's one man that stands on the carpet,
right?
That's,

103
00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:37.540
that's the way it works.
And sometimes being one man,
that's,

104
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.100
that's a little bit of an isolating feeling.

105
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.310
And to help help you understand that our leading petty officer Charlop tune,

106
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.960
awesome,
awesome,
amazing seal,
but love the guy.
And uh,

107
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.100
hopefully it can be on here one of these days.
But after,

108
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.360
maybe they're heroes as retirement cups when one of these days.
But,
uh,

109
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.380
he was,
I remember we were,
we were up in Nevada training and,

110
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:02.270
uh,
we took a couple of days to go snowboarding,
which was a,

111
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.810
an awesome,
good deal.
And he's like,
oh,
we're in the van.
He looks around,

112
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.430
he sees me.
He's like,
I'm not the senior guy.
And she,

113
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.410
and uh,

114
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.720
so he's screaming and laughing about how awesome it is to not be the senior guy

115
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.260
cause he knows the burden of command is now with me,
not with him.

116
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.760
If fuck guys get in trouble or do something stupid,
they should have done,

117
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.930
which is,
while you're in Tahoe guys getting in trouble and doing stuff,

118
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:31.520
stupid is probably a fairly likely thing to happen.
Highly probable.

119
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.170
That's one of my favorite trips that I did multiple times.
Yeah.

120
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.250
So that's it,
man.
Build relationships.
And at the same time you are,

121
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.100
when you're in charge,
you're in charge and there's a little bit of a,

122
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.590
that's called the burden of command.
Embrace it.
