This is Jocko podcast number 102 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.520
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.100
And we are rolling into some Q and a from the interwebs.
Sure.

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.090
So let's go right to it.
Jocko.

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.590
Is there ever a good time to use an ultimatum?

6
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.290
That's a great question.
And I think the answer's actually,

7
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.410
I think what everyone thinks about the answer,
I think it's pretty

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.490
self evident and I think a lot of people will agree with it.
Okay.

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.020
So is there ever a good time to use an ultimatum?
I think sometimes there is,

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.620
but it's seldom.
It's actually very seldom.

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.600
But when enough is truly enough,

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.040
then you've got to draw the line and you've got to hold the line,
right?

13
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:54.970
So you've got to make an ultimatum.
Uh,

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.450
one thing that is extremely critical is that you should never make an ultimatum

15
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:05.451
that you won't or can't keep right off the blow off if you say it.

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.533
Do it.

17
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.200
And what's interesting from a job perspective,

18
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.180
so like in the workplace perspective,

19
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.330
let's say up the chain of command up the chain of command,
it's not good.
Right?

20
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.890
So,
so let's say you're my boss and I come in and say,
Echo,
I want to raise,

21
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.670
I want to buy this Friday or I'm Outta here,
right?

22
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.630
That's an ultimatum.
And that means I'm trying to hold you hostage.

23
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.810
Most people do not like being held hostage.

24
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.050
So my chances of actually supporting what you're trying to make happen are very

25
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:49.190
small because I'm actually mad at you.
I don't want to support you.
Ooh,

26
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:50.160
you're a big critical guy.

27
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.910
Cause you press record and you made some videos for me.
You know what I mean?

28
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:57.000
Like it's like that.
But you're throwing an ultimatum at me.

29
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.600
That's where we're at.
We couldn't have a conversation.

30
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:03.570
We couldn't come to an agreement.
So you're going to walk into me.
I'm the boss.

31
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.730
I just reversed roles.
You're walking to me.
I'm the boss.

32
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:08.400
So you're going to say Jocko,

33
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.110
I wore raise and I want it now or I am out of here on Friday.

34
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.990
That's my ultimatum.
What?
What are you doing it right?

35
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.720
Are you building a relationship with me?
No.

36
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.830
Are you giving any room to negotiate or money?

37
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.650
Are you giving yourself any room to maneuver?
No.
No,
you're not.

38
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.450
You're not giving yourself any room to maneuver.

39
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.680
So that one generally doesn't work very well.
Now.

40
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.310
Now if you have another job offer that someone has put in front of you that's

41
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:40.140
legit and it's good and it's solid,
and,
and you come in to me and say,
Hey Jocko,

42
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:42.750
I got another job offer.
They want an answer by Friday,

43
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.780
here's what they're going to pay me.
I'm not,
this isn't a threat.

44
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.820
I'm not trying to be a jerk.
I'm being straight up with you.

45
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.970
But if you don't give me what I want by Friday,

46
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:53.550
I'm going to have to leave and go cause I gotta I gotta improve my future.

47
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.970
And I'd say,
hey man,
that sounds like a great deal of working for them.
Go

48
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.340
Right?

49
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 1>But that,
so that's,
that's an ultimatum.
But it's a rational one,
right?</v>

50
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.890
Because you actually have a backup and you actually are trying to be

51
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.150
straightforward with me.
Yeah.
So,
so that's an ultimatum.
But it's,

52
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.400
it's like a logical one now down the chain of command,

53
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.910
people don't like it.
Ultimatums either.
For instance,
you know,
uh,

54
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.440
Echo,
if you don't have this project done by Friday,

55
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.760
you're fired.

56
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.980
So now I put a big ultimatum on you and you don't like that anymore than the

57
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.800
Boston people don't like having ultimatums put on them.

58
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.460
So what really do if you have to use ultimatums down the chain of command,

59
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.950
and you should check your leadership real real quick because you've made some

60
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:43.990
mistakes,
right?
People don't understand the deadlines.

61
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.910
People don't understand what it is you want them to do.

62
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:47.620
People don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.

63
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.940
There's all kinds of things that they don't understand.

64
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.880
If you have to start throwing ultimatums around as a boss.
Yeah,

65
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.980
so really if you find yourself using ultimatums,

66
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.180
then you need to check your leadership.
Now,

67
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.350
that being said,
if you,

68
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.620
if I've talked to you,
if I've coached you,
if I've counseled you,

69
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.520
if I've done a written statement on you and told you exactly what it is I need

70
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.150
echo to do and now we've,

71
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.600
we've passed the point of no return.
I go,
okay,
Echo.

72
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.300
Here's what I asked you to do.
You didn't do it.
This is the ultimatum.

73
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.630
If you don't start making three videos a week,

74
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.580
you are not going to be here anymore.
And you'd say,
you'd either say,
okay,

75
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:35.230
well I'm going to do it,
or screw Jocko,

76
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.350
he's a jerk,
I'm outta here.
And either way,

77
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.360
W I've moved forward because you weren't doing it before.
And that's sort,

78
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:47.890
I know that that example is,
you know,
of hits close to home.

79
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.520
So ultimatums be very,
very careful.
Make sure if you're going to use it,

80
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.410
it's gotta be real.

81
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.270
You've got to enforce it and check yourself.
Don't,

82
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.420
don't,
don't get yourself in a position where you can't maneuver anymore.

83
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.090
That's the biggest that to me,
that's the biggest point.

84
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.450
You never want to take away your ability to move,
maneuver.

85
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.230
You don't want to do that.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
And it,
or it feels like,

86
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.360
you know,
just how you kind of said it to me.

87
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:19.210
Well that first one where the tone has like a lot to do with it.
Yeah.

88
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:22.900
Like how you were like,
you know,
you're legitimate,
logical ultimately.
Right.

89
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.400
It seemed like it wasn't like the first one leave.
We'll look,

90
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.430
give me this or I'm outta here kind of thing.
And then the second year,

91
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:33.730
second example,
it's sort of like,
hey,
you know,
see what's going on.
And yeah,

92
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.960
it feels like if someone did that to me either way up or down,

93
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.980
I feel like it would still maintain the relationship,
you know,

94
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.160
like let's say let's say it worked out and it was like,
okay,
you know,

95
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:46.660
whatever you got the raise or whatever.

96
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.680
And if you sit in that crazy tone or whatever,
when that real fed up tone,

97
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.600
you're still like,
okay,
cool.
We,
we worked it out,
I got what I want,
but,
but,
um,

98
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.610
but we know,
dinged the relationship,

99
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.460
it's deemed and we don't want to be digging or relationships.

100
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:05.210
We want to be building those things.
And I think a lot of times people,

101
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:08.900
like they'll ding the relationship and then they'll just move on like nothing.

102
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.550
But meanwhile the other person's like,
Hey,

103
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.660
don't forget what you said to me and how you said that last week.

104
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:17.470
Time heals the wounds,
but it doesn't remove the scars.

105
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.890
Yeah,
yeah.
By the way.
Slapshot okay.

106
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.830
All alright.
Next question.

107
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.120
Graduated high school,
crushed it.
Straight A's,
boom.

108
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.920
Help my classmates with kindness kind and helpful and expected them to be.

109
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.020
Meanwhile,
they put me down,
mocked me,

110
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.490
never loved me in a room with 30 people.
I was always alone.

111
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.300
Inner voice tells me to go after the past.
Seek revenge.

112
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.560
Keep looking at their profiles.
Profiles,
like online profiles on social media.

113
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:55.940
Yeah.
Yeah.
Should I go now?
He's got a series of questions here.

114
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.090
Should I go after them and try to fix the past,

115
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.170
either by revenge or else should I,

116
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.970
should I remove them from social media and leave the Facebook group?

117
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.470
Should I attend the reunion?
Why have they even been in my life?
Okay,

118
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:15.560
so let's break those down.
Number one,

119
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.060
should I go after them and try to fix the past either by revenge or something

120
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:26.720
else to answer that,
in my opinion is no man,

121
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.060
who cares?
They're high school kids.
Move on.
Get on with your life.
Disagree.

122
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:35.300
Agree,
agree.
Okay.
That one's me is pretty straight forward.

123
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.730
Don't worry about these Germans.

124
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.710
I actually had a couple conversations with,
with uh,

125
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.130
my oldest daughters haven't had this one with my son yet,
but my older daughters,

126
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.300
which is,
hey look,

127
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:50.510
these people that are around right now that you think are so important in high

128
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:54.620
school,
they're not,
you know,
some of them might be,

129
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:56.840
you might have some lifelong friends from high school.
I get that.

130
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.440
But these people that are not nice to you,
you won't be thinking about them.

131
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.470
So I don't,
I'm not sure how old this individual is,

132
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.980
but she's got a couple more years before he won't be thinking about these people

133
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:10.250
anymore.
So just get there earlier question too.

134
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.360
Should I remove them from social media and leave this Facebook group?
Okay.

135
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:18.620
This is a little bit tricky in my opinion.
Uh,
first of all,

136
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.030
if you can,
if you can stay,
if you can keep them on social media,

137
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.920
but ignore them completely,
just leave me alone.

138
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.400
Just leave it and just totally ignore them because when you leave them or

139
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:34.790
whatever,
you're kind of,
aren't you kind of making a scene?

140
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.790
I just want to make sure.
Do you want to make a scene?
Well,
yeah,

141
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.340
like when you unfriend them or whatever,
which it didn't.

142
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:45.110
You and I have some situation with the we did.
Yeah,
actually.
Okay,
so

143
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.620
I know that I,
wait,
wait,
who unfriended you?
My wife.
Yup.

144
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.140
Okay,
so you did it well,
no,
no,
no.
I didn't even know how to do it.

145
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.480
Now you figured it out?
No,
I didn't.

146
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.720
So I didn't ever have social media until two years ago,

147
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.780
but all of a sudden I saw echo friends with my wife and I said,

148
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:09.330
well wait,
wait.
She's showing me something.
And she says,
and I see echo.

149
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.580
And I said,
well why are you friends with people that,

150
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.110
why are you friends with people that I know a or click on the friend on that?

151
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.810
And I didn't even know it was a big deal.
I just thought,
you know,
hey,
that means,

152
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.910
and,
and then I didn't realize a big deal.

153
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.330
It's a big deal,
man.
Unfriended him messed up.

154
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.560
I thought you did it per purposefully knowing it's a big deal,

155
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:35.490
but not understanding that it's even a bigger deal than you know.
Okay.

156
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.380
Where you're like unfriend him as a joke.
That was like,

157
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.650
it was totally your personality at that thought.
I did that to you.
Yeah.

158
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:41.990
Like as a joke,
like I'm afraid them,

159
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.560
you don't say something to me like immediately or was it,

160
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.360
did it did a month go by where I didn't make a joke about it.
I forget.
So,

161
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.580
so it is kind of making a scene.
If you,

162
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.380
if you unfriend this person or you leave the group,

163
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.880
then you're just creating a little firestorm.
But I will say this,
if you can't,

164
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.470
if you can't keep yourself from checking on them,
then you might have to do that.

165
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.600
So try it for a couple of weeks just so I'm not looking at them.
Yeah,

166
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.790
let them go.
Just leave him.

167
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.790
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.090
<v 1>If you can't do that,
then delete them and leave the group or whatever.</v>

169
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.380
So the number three,
should I attend the reunion?

170
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.780
My answer to that is negative.
Don't.
Why would you?
These people are negative.

171
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.350
They have,
they bring back negative memories.

172
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.690
They didn't treat you well,
they,

173
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.610
but why would you?
You don't need to move on again.
Key Word I think.
Move on.

174
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.103
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.700
<v 1>And then the last question is why have they even been in my life?</v>

176
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:54.591
Well,

177
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:59.591
I think just like anything else bad that happens in life,

178
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.390
the things that are bad that happened in life

179
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.720
can either teach you or break you and you got to decide what you want them to

180
00:11:10.751 --> 00:11:14.570
do.
I vote that you,
you allow it to teach you.
I,
I,
I vote.

181
00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:18.760
Did you learn from these people that you learn how to forget about the past?

182
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:21.940
That you learn how to ignore people that are negative,

183
00:11:21.941 --> 00:11:26.941
that you learn to control your vengeful ideas and that you learn to move on into

184
00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:30.370
the future where you're going to meet better people and better times are to be

185
00:11:30.371 --> 00:11:34.690
had.
That's what I would recommend.
Don't worry about these people from the past.

186
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.790
They're caught up in this weird world.
Yeah.
High School.

187
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.820
This is high school,
right?

188
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.870
There were caught up in high school world or worried about high school.

189
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.270
Get into the world.
Yeah.
Right.
Big Time.
Well,

190
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.270
I've had one daughter that now graduated from high school.

191
00:11:52.271 --> 00:11:55.330
I got two kids in high right now.
Yeah.
Drama.
There's drama,

192
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.870
but actually believe it or not,
there hasn't been a lot of drama with my kids.

193
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.330
Not a lot of high school drama.
That doesn't surprise me,
but,
but I see it,

194
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.760
it does happen.
And I remember the drama.
I'd say my guess,
I don't know.

195
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.810
It's been a long time since high school for me personally.
But yeah,
man,

196
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:16.030
I think that's life.
You know,
high school is drama.

197
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.460
A bunch of kids not knowing nothing.

198
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.880
Is there more drama in high school than there is in life?

199
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.880
Maybe it's because it's stuck together.
Yeah,
it seems like a,
you're stuck there.

200
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:31.720
It depends on your life.

201
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.900
Like if you just consider it a typical high school versus my life.
Yeah.

202
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:38.380
Way More in high school drama and my I in your drama,
that's it.

203
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.100
And you're not even really that job.
Really.
Yeah.

204
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.760
They're all high school.
Although even this guy obviously,
you know,

205
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:50.170
so it's gonna feel like way more than it is for sure.
But you know,
when you,

206
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.030
when you the,
the further you go along in life,

207
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.000
the more you realize that this means less and less,
these types of things anyway,

208
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.900
when you consider it high school was really just for learning.
Sure.

209
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:04.010
You learn things too.

210
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.280
You know what I just thought of is what's interesting about this is if you're

211
00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:10.660
looking back on high school,

212
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.280
either with fond memories or with negative memories that way,

213
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:18.970
it's not a great thing because you could be like uncle Rico from Napoleon

214
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:21.090
dynamite.
Right.

215
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.450
Just constantly living back his high school football games and he's wishing he

216
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:28.780
made that pass and you know what I mean?
One the state championship or whatever.

217
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.930
Yeah.
You get to,
that's not good.
Right.
That means you're stuck in high school.

218
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.370
You peaked in high school.
Yeah.
If you're looking back at the negative things,

219
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.060
same thing.
Yes and no move forward.
Yeah.

220
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:45.550
In his defense though,
obviously he just graduated.
That's what life really is.

221
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.500
This really,
you know,
it's still new.
It's like,
you know,

222
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.460
someone more good stuff's going to happen,
brother.

223
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.500
You just move on and get after it.
Yeah.
Probably the social media thing.

224
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:55.570
Now I'll say this cause there's,

225
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.410
there's little levels of like unfriending what are,
you can unfollow someone.

226
00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.220
I'm assuming this is Facebook.
I don't know.
There's so many.

227
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.420
He could be talking about other stuff,
but on Facebook you can still remain,

228
00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.440
remain friends,
but just unfollow them so you won't get all their stuff.

229
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.840
Do they know that?
I don't think so.

230
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:19.070
I'm sure many people have unfollowed me and I don't know that I've never gotten

231
00:14:19.071 --> 00:14:23.380
in the alert or whatever.
Um,
I would say leave the group fully.
Oh,

232
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.330
I always listen to your advice more than me because I don't understand it as

233
00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:31.530
much as you do.
I,
I don't,
I don't understand the Facebook group thing.
Yeah.

234
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.360
I mean,
depends how many people are going to make a scene.

235
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.330
I don't like to make a scene.
Yeah.
So I'd be like,
well no,

236
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:38.260
I'm just gonna ignore it.
Yeah.

237
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:40.210
I don't think leaving the group as a scene if it is,

238
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:42.640
I mean obviously it depends on how many people in the group is less people in

239
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:45.460
the group.
Don't worry of a scene it's going to be,
or if he's always posting,

240
00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:48.430
if he's the head of the group or something like this,
then yeah.

241
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:53.150
You know how in the past there was etiquette schools I went to,

242
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.410
I went to etiquette classes when I went to officer candidate school in
Pensacola,

243
00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:00.560
Florida.
And they teach you which knife to use,
all that stuff,

244
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:04.940
and they teach you things.
For instance,
you might not know this.

245
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.380
If you take a bite of food and there's something in that bite of food that you

246
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:12.890
don't want to eat a bone of,
whatever.

247
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.460
The way to properly get it out of your mouth is to use your fork,

248
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:22.130
put it on the fork and put it back down on the plate.
So like,
yeah.
Okay,
Gotcha.

249
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.600
They would say the same.
So that's the type of thing.
There should be a class

250
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.120
or we're going to a point where people are gonna need a class on social media

251
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:36.440
etiquette.
Actually,
that's not a bad idea.
You should teach it.
All right,

252
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.030
let's move on.
I sorry.
Yeah,
the high school.
Move on.

253
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:46.510
Move on,
brother.
Move on.
Let's move on from that question.
There it is.

254
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.270
We don't,
you know,
that's like,
that's like,
you know,
that's,

255
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.300
we focused on social media,
but that's just about everything,
right?

256
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.610
Anything that you're caught up in,
anything that you're caught up in.
Yeah.

257
00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.530
That's dragging you down.
Just move on.
Whether it's a girl,

258
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.150
whether it's the job you should have had,

259
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:04.480
whether it's the investment you should have made,
whether it's the,

260
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.230
the house you didn't buy that you should have all those things move on man.

261
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.090
It's gone.
Move on.
Yeah,
it seems like high school is,
it's really common one,

262
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:14.301
you know,

263
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:19.130
like the old classic story of the person who got bullied in high school and then

264
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.750
going back to the finish [inaudible] you know,
like that kind of stuff.
But yeah,

265
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:28.250
the more,
and this is what it feels like to,
I don't know,
I'm not everyone,

266
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.960
but the more you do for yourself after high school,
for sure.

267
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.750
The last high school is going to mean for sure.
Like this isn't gonna end.

268
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:38.570
You know how they say Uncle Rico,
man,
he,

269
00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:42.220
you sell in Tupperware and it wasn't working out good for him.
Yeah.

270
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.430
He high school is still a big deal to yeah.
You know guys who were like,

271
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.970
they always talk about high school football or whatever and there's guys like

272
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:54.690
that for sure.
Um,
then you can,
it's kind of an indicator,
you know,
that Oh,

273
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.620
you know,
he might not be doing much now,
so shit,

274
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.520
they're like 40 or something like that.
Check.

275
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:07.280
I next wish.
I'm thinking about starting Jujitsu in my MMA gym,

276
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.140
but the instructor is a brown belt.

277
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:14.270
Should I go train with him or look for a black belt
for,

278
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.330
well,
if you're at an MMA gym,
they have brown belt.
That's awesome.

279
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.240
God turned with a brown belt.
I think he's probably really,
really good.

280
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.930
I think it's probably fight oriented because it's in a fight to fight gym,

281
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.960
which is good in my opinion.
And you know,

282
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:32.450
the fact of matter is,
and we've said this before,
Brown belt,
purple belt,

283
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:37.040
black belt,
there's good teachers in all of those blue belt,

284
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.140
you know,
borderline.
Really,
you can learn some good fundamentals from work.

285
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:45.320
Solid blue belt though.
I agree.
But,
um,

286
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.380
and also there's some black belts that are not good teachers and there's some

287
00:17:51.061 --> 00:17:55.140
purple belts that are phenomenal teachers.
So yeah.

288
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.600
Gautrain yeah,
I think that's pretty simple question.
Yup.
Yeah.
The

289
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:05.610
DPA,
you know how you just said like some,
some purple belts are great teachers.

290
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:11.070
So the,
the belt usually for the most part just indicates the vast,

291
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:14.940
like the knowledge,
you know,
so it's given that they're a good teacher.
So yeah,

292
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:15.930
if it's a brown belt shoot,

293
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:19.680
that's a lot of knowledge and just given that he's all right or better teacher

294
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.580
that's going to be legit.
And there is actually blue belts as well,

295
00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.690
said that there's some blue belts that are really good teachers.
Yeah.

296
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.140
Although it does,
you know,
you get a purple belt teacher,

297
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.350
whereas the blue belt teacher and they're good teachers,
both of them.

298
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.720
Of course you're gonna want the party cause he's going to have more knowledge.

299
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:42.060
You so you know,
blue belt,
in most cases it is in most cases,
cases.
Yeah.

300
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.670
But if you're just starting your own,
you can pray.

301
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:47.940
You're just going to be like a sponge.
If someone you don't even know what you,

302
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.670
you know what's interesting,
you could probably barely tell.

303
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.690
If you're a white belt and you roll with the purple belt and a black belt,

304
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:58.900
you wouldn't be able to delegate.
Yes.
All you know is you got your ass whooped.

305
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.020
That's what you know.
That's all you know.

306
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:04.110
You don't know how easy it was for them because this is the same level for both.

307
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:07.530
Neither one of those people's try and hard against white belt.
Yeah.
And yeah,

308
00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:10.680
and if they know how to teach,
like I said,
he's an instructor.

309
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:13.740
He's the instructor brown belt.
Yeah.
He's going to be fine.
In fact,

310
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:16.350
that's way more common than you think.
I mean,
we're in San Diego,

311
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.920
even in San Diego though.
There's a brown belt instructors for sure.

312
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.270
And they're good too.
Yeah.
And especially if you're just starting.
Yeah,
man.
Good.

313
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.600
Do that.
And Yeah,
just like how you said though,

314
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.300
sometimes the black belt instructor,
he'll be good at rolling,

315
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.880
he'll be good at Jujitsu and he can win tournaments when he can't really

316
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:36.090
instruct that good or they or you get like situations where,

317
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.820
I mean I wouldn't say it's super common but it's there for sure is,

318
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.140
you know,
you heard the expression [inaudible] knowledge,
right?

319
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.120
It's like you've been a black belt for so long or anything right.

320
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.360
It just so good at something that you forget what it's like to be a beginner.

321
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.150
So you Kinda,
you know,

322
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.120
you might skip over some details that are kind of critical if you're a beginner,

323
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.040
you know,
you just kind of,

324
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.980
your subconscious just assumes that this person knows a certain amount of
things.

325
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:05.270
You know,
you can get that like that's I think a lot of times what gems are.

326
00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:09.780
But really advanced teachers watching Andy and Noah role,

327
00:20:09.781 --> 00:20:14.781
we are doing some rounds of Andy and Noah tucked his foot underneath the far arm

328
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.640
on an arm walk from across like cross side,
like a regular arm lock.

329
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:28.530
And Noah's talking his foot under there and dean says,
know,
hey,

330
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:32.160
that's a really good detail to who taught you that.
And I was like,

331
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.820
I taught him and he was like,
I taught him and nobody that,

332
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.900
that's something that Dean taught me.
And I don't know who taught.
No,

333
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.660
but it's just,

334
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.680
that's the type of detail that you're talking about where that is a small thing.

335
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.890
You gotta be in Jujitsu for it.

336
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.430
You got to get a lot of other things right before someone says when your arm

337
00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:50.920
walking,
someone on the far side,
put your,

338
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.540
put your toes basically underneath their arm to secure their shoulder a little

339
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:59.680
bit better.
That's deep.
There's so there's those kinds of details.

340
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.780
There was another thing where I had a,
uh,

341
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.030
a finish for Dean or dean was teaching me an arm lock finish and I would try it

342
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:10.600
and I was trying and we're trying,
I would try it and it would never work.

343
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.500
I tried it on him 50 times and finally one day he says,
Hey,

344
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.400
when you do that move,
put the pressure here instead of here.
The next time.

345
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.990
I did it to him worked.
Do you know what I mean?
And then one little detail

346
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.170
it.
Same thing happened the other day with Andy.

347
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.690
I was going with Andy and we were doing the arm lock escapes and he said,

348
00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:33.160
Hey,
you're putting your pressure here.

349
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.450
He showed me where I was putting the pressure.

350
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.170
He said put it here and I was like,
hmm,
next time I did it to him he's like,

351
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:41.200
that hurts so bad.
So it's weird.

352
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:44.380
It's the little details that again,

353
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:49.381
the better the instructor is the the more detailed too you're going to get and

354
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.150
most,
well,
what's important about this is until you are,

355
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:57.340
get to a certain level you,

356
00:21:57.341 --> 00:21:59.870
those details don't even mean anything to you because you,

357
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:04.120
you can't worry about where you're putting some little detail on an arm lock

358
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:06.190
when you don't even know how to do the Armagnac and that'd be pretty damn good

359
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:09.310
at the arm lock before you started looking at the little tiny details and then

360
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:10.144
they,
and that's it.

361
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.920
That was actually going to be part of the point where you get a black belt,

362
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:18.190
super advanced level instructor.

363
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:20.860
But he's not necessarily that good at being a teacher.

364
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.520
He'll start teaching those details and all stuff.
Whoa.

365
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:28.420
You just skipped over the part to teach them how to do the actual Armbar,

366
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.600
but he's like kind of subconsciously there'll be like heal the crystal of

367
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:36.670
knowledge says that.
It's kind of just assumed this is,

368
00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:40.820
and this is good for the Jujitsu journey.
I used to say this when,

369
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.460
when I'm teaching you a Jujitsu move,

370
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.640
let's say there's 10 things that you have to do to make the Jujitsu move work.

371
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.190
I can teach you five of them.

372
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.420
The other five you have to figure out because it's where you're putting your

373
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:56.770
weight and it's where you're putting your balance.

374
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.330
Dean might be able to teach you seven
maybe.

375
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.840
Maybe if you take a different class,
Andy,
we'll teach you an eight to one,

376
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.200
but there's things that you have to figure out on your own on top of the things

377
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:15.400
that you can be shown.
Yeah.
That's why you got a roll.
Yeah.
Big Time.

378
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.780
You got a role because that's the only way you figure out if it actually works

379
00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:23.710
or not and what little adjustments you have to make.
Yeah,
yeah,
fully.

380
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.920
And especially if you have a good instructor,
they can see it too.
You know,

381
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:30.790
like you know when you drill something or when you're doing the technique just

382
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:32.740
with your partner and stuff,
you're like,
okay,
yeah,
good.

383
00:23:32.741 --> 00:23:35.560
That's good technique and no one will like us moving and trying to defend or

384
00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:37.900
whatever.
It's like I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
It's not working.

385
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.650
And really the obvious answer is yeah,
because he's not letting you do it,

386
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:44.920
but you know,
someone like an instructor can look and see like,
oh,

387
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.980
you're letting him do

388
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.330
<v 3>this or what or whatever you're forgetting to do this check.
But nonetheless,</v>

389
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:55.030
yeah,
I agree with you.
Go train with the brown belt guy,
see how it go train.
Yeah.

390
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.610
But if you're not learning nothing,
then you can make that evaluation.

391
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:01.280
But the fact that he's a brown belt,
you'll be learning a ton.

392
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.820
It'd be learning a ton given that for sure.
Next question.

393
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.560
You talk about playing the game,
quote unquote to win,

394
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.900
but what about people that play the game to win for themselves and how do I

395
00:24:14.901 --> 00:24:18.520
defeat them?
That's a good,
good question and it,

396
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.580
it hit me when I saw that question.
I was like,
Ooh,
that's a good

397
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:23.740
<v 0>point.
And that's a good,</v>

398
00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:26.890
there's a very important distinction there because I'm always saying play the

399
00:24:26.891 --> 00:24:30.970
game right here.
You got to play the game,
you got to,

400
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.970
you got to build the relationships with the boss and you got to learn what they

401
00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:36.460
like and you got to toe the party line.
You kind of do the little things.

402
00:24:36.461 --> 00:24:41.461
You got to support the corporate headquarters or the boss or the man,

403
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:47.020
right?
Or whatever entity is up in that ivory tower.

404
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.910
I want you to play the game,
get them on your side.

405
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:57.570
And the reason I saved to do those things is that so you can get more control so

406
00:24:58.661 --> 00:25:03.661
that people ask your opinion so that you get listened to so that perhaps you get

407
00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:04.684
promoted,

408
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.993
<v 3>which is good.</v>

409
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:13.390
<v 0>But the reason you're doing all those things,</v>

410
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:18.470
the reason that you're playing the game is to help your team accomplished the

411
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:21.500
mission.
That's what you are trying to do.

412
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.770
It's to help your team accomplish the mission.

413
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.530
Now the,
the other side of that is what this question is about.

414
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.810
People that are playing the game for personal gain,

415
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.600
they,
they play the games that they can get listened to so they can drive their

416
00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:42.920
personal agenda.

417
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.140
So they so vague can get promoted and they want to get promoted so that they can

418
00:25:48.141 --> 00:25:51.500
abuse their power.
And maybe that abuse of power is just,

419
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.990
is just working less.
Maybe it's making other people do the crap jobs,

420
00:25:56.991 --> 00:25:58.220
whatever the,
whatever the case may be.

421
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:00.680
But they've got an agenda and they're going to try and get promoted so they can

422
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:02.360
take care of themselves.

423
00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.530
And that is not why I tell you to play the game.

424
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.190
And that's not why I played the game and I definitely played the game and I

425
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:11.024
played to win,

426
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:16.150
but I played because I wanted my my squad or my platoon or my task unit or my

427
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:21.350
training command to be able to better accomplish our mission.

428
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.790
That's what I played the game.

429
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.283
<v 3>Now.</v>

430
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:31.340
<v 0>Well there is a secondary benefit of playing the game and that is that you could</v>

431
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.090
possibly get promoted earlier.

432
00:26:34.091 --> 00:26:37.950
You could get praise from the boss that looks good on your record and,

433
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.480
and all those things can happen when you're playing the game.

434
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.360
But that's just like collateral sort of fringe benefits.

435
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.980
But that's not why you're playing the game.

436
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:52.250
You play the game to help the team win and when the team wins you win,

437
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.740
which also makes the team win again.

438
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:58.830
So it's like a positive cycle cause you start developing a good reputation.

439
00:26:58.831 --> 00:27:01.530
Now you get more leeway from the Boston,
have more leeway you get from the boss.

440
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.900
The more you have the ability to make maneuvers on the battlefield,

441
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:06.330
but more you can maneuver on the battlefield,
the more offensive you can be,

442
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:07.980
the more offensive you can be,
the more you win,

443
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.610
and then you get more ability to move more because your boss is giving you even

444
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:15.180
more room to maneuver.
So it's a,
it's a cycle.
It's a good positive cycle.

445
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.880
Now when you have someone that's on the team that's playing the game for

446
00:27:20.881 --> 00:27:25.460
themselves,
first of all,
no one likes that person,
right?

447
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.340
Everyone can see that person.
Yeah.
No one likes them and there's,
believe me,

448
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:30.174
the military,

449
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.830
the military has unbelievable people that play the game for the best possible

450
00:27:34.831 --> 00:27:38.010
reasons to help their platoon and help the mission to help succeed.

451
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.460
There's also plenty of people in the military and in every,

452
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.940
every different line of work.

453
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.910
There's plenty of people that play the game because they want to,
they want them.

454
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.720
They want to look out for themselves.
Looking out for number one right?

455
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.420
Isn't that the expression they're looking out for?
Number one,

456
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.740
there's plenty of people.
And I dealt with people like that all the time.

457
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.463
And what did I do?

458
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.070
<v 4>Okay.</v>

459
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.700
<v 0>I used it to my advantage and I'll tell you what I would get in their head.</v>

460
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.120
And what I would do is I would make them think that the best way for them to win

461
00:28:13.601 --> 00:28:16.480
for themselves personally was for the team to win.

462
00:28:16.481 --> 00:28:18.190
That I would get that into their head cause let's talk.

463
00:28:18.191 --> 00:28:20.410
A lot of times they missed that point.
They're looking out for themselves,

464
00:28:20.411 --> 00:28:21.310
they're not worried about the team.

465
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.660
And I would get them thinking that they're going to look the best if the team

466
00:28:25.661 --> 00:28:27.850
wins.
Hey,
if you really want to look good,

467
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.320
the best way you can get promoted as if we look good.
You know,

468
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.600
if there's a team does great.
If you get us the gear,
we want the equipment,

469
00:28:34.601 --> 00:28:35.890
we want their training that we need,

470
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.980
that's the best way you're going to look awesome cause we're going to succeed

471
00:28:38.981 --> 00:28:41.200
more than that's going to make you look good.
And I'm,

472
00:28:41.201 --> 00:28:44.200
of course I'm going to be more tactful and I'm not saying it like that,

473
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.680
but I'm saying it right.
Right.
Getting them to get the messaging.

474
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.800
Is there going to be saying,
hey,
you know,

475
00:28:50.801 --> 00:28:54.970
our boss doesn't like our boss doesn't like leaders that complain.
Right.

476
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.440
You know a kid,
you can tell the boss,
he doesn't like complainers,

477
00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.420
you know what I mean?
Little blue things like that,
right?
Yeah.
Hey,
the boss,

478
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.970
the boss likes to hear the truth about stuff he wants to know.

479
00:29:03.971 --> 00:29:08.740
You know what I mean?
Little things like that.
And you know what?

480
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.760
Here's the thing,
that person,
that person might get the promotion.

481
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.570
<v 4>Okay.</v>

482
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.840
<v 0>Because what you've done is you've helped them act correctly actually,</v>

483
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:21.020
and there's a chance,
a decent chance,

484
00:29:21.021 --> 00:29:24.290
a good chance even that they carry that forward.
They realize that,
hey,

485
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.510
the best way to play the game is to help the team.

486
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.820
And the best way to look good is to help,

487
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.280
is to make the team good and succeed at the mission.

488
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.293
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

489
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:38.090
<v 0>And it's really,
well,
you know,
one of the classic cases,</v>

490
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.030
then we'll know we'll,
we'll get into ownership a little,

491
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.930
but if something goes wrong,
right,

492
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.120
the person that's looking out for themselves blames everyone else.

493
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.060
And so that's a challenge,
right?
Because once you start blaming,

494
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.630
once that ball starts blaming everyone,

495
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:57.280
then the whole team starts blaming each other.
So how do you fix that?
Well it's,

496
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:00.340
we've talked about this a million times.
You step up and say,
hey,

497
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.430
you know what boss is my fault and loss.
Cause that's right.
It's your fault.

498
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.213
And there's a,

499
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:12.030
there's a good chance that they recognize how positive that is.

500
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.680
And it may take a while and it may never happen because some people are just

501
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:22.330
savages,
right?
Some people are just complete.
They only care about themselves.

502
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:27.220
They only care about the next promotion and getting the next award and getting

503
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:30.810
the next bit of recognition.
There's people like that,
there's the,

504
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:34.840
they're horrible,
they're horrible,
they exist.

505
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.200
But they're pretty small.
Most people,
if they see,
hey this,

506
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:42.100
this is working for this guy,
it can work for me too.

507
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:46.660
And that starts to spread.
And the other thing that happens,

508
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:50.920
I think is if someone's just a flagrant self promoter,

509
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.150
that you might get them one promotion because you were there to kind of make

510
00:30:57.151 --> 00:31:00.060
them look good,
but the next time around they're going to get seen.

511
00:31:00.061 --> 00:31:01.670
They're going to get found out.
They're gonna.

512
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.540
People are gonna realize what kind of person they are and that's,

513
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.660
that's where it catches up with them.

514
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.820
So you keep playing the game,
you keep,
you keep working hard,

515
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.240
don't worry about them and actually do your best to help them out.

516
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.880
The person that's like self promoting,
do your best to help them out.

517
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.750
They're the boss.
Make them look good.
Oh,

518
00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:26.450
how was wanting to make my boss look good?
Yup.

519
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.540
It's going to help you in the long run.
It can hurt sometimes.
It's hard to do.

520
00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:32.670
Sometimes our ego gets in the way.

521
00:31:32.671 --> 00:31:35.910
Sometimes you got to put that ego in check because what's more important?

522
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.990
Because if you're my boss Echo and you're doing this just to make yourself look

523
00:31:39.991 --> 00:31:43.860
good,
if I then undermine you will,

524
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.050
and now we don't accomplish the mission as well.

525
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.500
I'm actually a bad person because I didn't do my best to accomplish the mission.

526
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.130
We didn't look good.
I'm not worried about how we look,

527
00:31:53.131 --> 00:31:55.530
but we failed in our mission and we didn't do our mission to the best of our

528
00:31:55.531 --> 00:31:59.520
ability.
So No,
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You want to look great.
Cool.

529
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.490
I want to make you look great because I want us to look great doing our mission

530
00:32:02.491 --> 00:32:03.840
because that's what's important to me.

531
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:09.230
And it's so some of the collateral damage of that is that you look great even

532
00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:11.370
though you're a jerk and I get you promoted,

533
00:32:11.371 --> 00:32:14.340
that's okay because eventually you're going to get found out or you're going to

534
00:32:14.341 --> 00:32:18.930
learn to be a better person and to support the team and that's how you got

535
00:32:18.931 --> 00:32:20.910
promoted and you're gonna realize that and you'll become a good leader.

536
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.190
<v 3>Yeah,
I agree with that one.</v>

537
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:32.030
<v 0>Like I always have where people can see that too.
You know,
they can see,
you know,</v>

538
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.160
like if your boss is like a self promoter or whatever and you have it in your

539
00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:40.400
head.
I understand.
I understand this because I've been in a situation

540
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.840
<v 3>where I'm like,
shoot,</v>

541
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.860
I kind of feel inside like I don't want to like make an effort to make them look

542
00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:46.730
good kind of thing.

543
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:51.030
Cause it's like he doesn't deserve it and the thing and what like what,

544
00:32:51.031 --> 00:32:53.450
I'm going to make them look good and now everyone's going to think that he looks

545
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:58.430
good kind of thing.
But then when you really think about it another not,
yeah,

546
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.800
you're right.
And the same goes though for you.
Like if you,
if you're like,

547
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.920
you know,
if you're just focusing on the positive stuff,

548
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.670
you know and you know how like your shit,
if you don't have anything nice to say,

549
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:14.540
don't say it at all.
If you're really doing that,
like people notice that too.

550
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.480
I was like man that guy is like really positive focusing on this,
you know,

551
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.040
kind of thing.

552
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.820
Like people see it and this doesn't mean you're just Mr positive sugar coat and

553
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:25.490
everything.
No it's not.
We're not talking about that.

554
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.980
But you are not focusing on the negative.
Instead of saying,

555
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.140
oh we're horrible at this.
You said,
you know what,

556
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.730
we've got some deficiencies here.
Here's what I'm gonna do to fix them.
Yeah.
Yeah.

557
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.850
How simple is that?
Just get better.
The point is people they see,
they see,

558
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.230
don't think that,
you know,
like you're going to help,
you know,

559
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:46.790
make this guy look good in.
They're just gonna.

560
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.790
They're going to not see it and they're just going to fall for that.

561
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.330
He is trick or something bad.
They see that most of the time.
Most of the time.

562
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.660
That example that you said about Tim,
uh,
playing to their ego or whatever,

563
00:33:59.661 --> 00:34:03.040
where you're like,
hey,
you're going to look really good if we were dumping.

564
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.210
So you ever seen the movie Milana?
I saw three minutes on it.
Oh,
see,

565
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:11.990
there you go.
She does.
Uh,
so the guy,
the main guy,
his name,
the Demi God,

566
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.720
his name is Molly and played by the Rock,
by the way.
20 Johnson.

567
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.330
Great movie by the way.
Um,
she does him like that.
She's like,
Hey,
let's,

568
00:34:20.331 --> 00:34:24.290
they got to go do this mission,
you know,
for restore the heart,
you know,
whatever.

569
00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:27.860
It's a long story,
but,
and he's like,
you know,
whatever reluctant.
And he's like,

570
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.300
she's like,
hey,
you'll be a hero again.
And he's like,
I'm already a hero.

571
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:36.650
She was like,
well go for a while.
You know,
you haven't done anything lately,

572
00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:41.480
but if you do this and you'll be the hero to everyone.
And Yeah,

573
00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.430
and of course he does it of course.
But yeah,
man,

574
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.660
it's good to get a quick example.
It works there it is.
Proof on Amada

575
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.413
trash.

576
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:58.460
I have to say that in a very competitive environment,

577
00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.430
extreme ownership can be used by your enemies

578
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.760
or the people that want your position.

579
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:10.100
When you take ownership over all faults of your team members,
you guys become,

580
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.340
you guys become better and get healthier,
a healthier attitude.

581
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.930
But that takes time.
So until your team improves and start to get better results,

582
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.530
your opponents will take those tens of it was my fault.

583
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.980
And present them to your boss as proof that,
yeah,

584
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.040
this guy is not good or at least not confident enough and looks weak is not my

585
00:35:30.051 --> 00:35:32.270
case.
For me,
it worked great,

586
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.090
but I've seen it happening too.

587
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:38.310
Few colleagues who just didn't have good team members

588
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:43.290
<v 0>and they took their extreme ownership for weakness and just took advantage of</v>

589
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:44.011
that.
Okay.

590
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:48.390
So what we've got here is what he's saying is extreme ownership.

591
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.310
If you're taking extreme ownership of things,

592
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.960
your enemies can actually take advantage of that.
And in this guy's case,
right?

593
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:57.990
Like in the like in the earlier stages of it.
Yeah.
And he said,

594
00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:59.790
well actually he says that for him it's worked great,

595
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:04.860
but that he's seen some of his compadres who have started to take ownership and

596
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:09.300
they're,
they've got weak team and the team,
what does he say here?

597
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:10.530
What's the words he uses?

598
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.370
They didn't have good team members and they took their extreme ownership for

599
00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:17.580
weakness and took advantage of it.
Okay.
So first of all,

600
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.493
out of the gate,

601
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.750
if you have weak or bad team members,

602
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.670
that is the first thing the leader needs to take ownership of.
Right.

603
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.370
If you have truly weak and bad team members,

604
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.310
then you need to either train them or coach them or get rid of them.

605
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:37.330
<v 4>Okay.</v>

606
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:41.790
<v 0>That's the first thing.
So if you've got backstabbing,</v>

607
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.470
bad team members that are looking to call you down as the leader,

608
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.970
you got a problem with those people and you need to fix that problem number one.

609
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:56.820
So let's just start with that.
Number two,
and this is,

610
00:36:56.821 --> 00:37:00.270
this is there's two,
two kind of parts of this.
There's an insecurity,

611
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.410
a level of insecurity,
and there's a level of,
or a,
uh,

612
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.530
uh,
a matter of perception.
The insecurity is the thing that says,

613
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.320
if I say this is my fault and everyone up and down,

614
00:37:13.321 --> 00:37:18.180
the chain of command is going to say,
fire him,
fire him.
It's his fault.

615
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.830
But I want you to think about how that's actually perceived.

616
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.380
If what you do is,

617
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:28.860
let's take the other example is what you do is you blame everyone else.

618
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.030
If that's your attitude,
if your attitude is,
it wasn't my fault,
it was his fault,

619
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:34.680
it was her fault.
It was their fault.
It was not me.

620
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:37.530
I'm just the person in charge is not me.
Think about that statement.

621
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.040
It's not my fault.
It's,
it's my team's fault.

622
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.910
I'm just the person in charge.
It's not my fault.
Think about that.

623
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.340
Whenever you're placing blame,

624
00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:49.380
if your leader and your placing blame on your team,

625
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.230
<v 4>okay,</v>

626
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.860
<v 0>what you're saying is,
hey,
it's not my fault.
It's my team's fault.</v>

627
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.870
I'm just the leader here.
I'm not the one out there in the field doing the work.

628
00:37:59.871 --> 00:38:02.720
I'm not the one that's making those decisions.
I'm not the one that's,

629
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:08.510
I'm not the one that's,
you know,
uh,
interacting with customers.

630
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.070
I'm not the one that's doing that.
So this isn't my fault.

631
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.690
It's my team's fault.
Well,
meanwhile,
guess who's in charge of the team?

632
00:38:17.691 --> 00:38:18.524
You are.

633
00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.930
So the minute that you start saying it wasn't my fault in his swirly,

634
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.080
everyone else's fault did that.
If you think about how you look to your boss,

635
00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:29.690
it's laughable.
You look like an idiot,

636
00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.420
<v 4>okay?</v>

637
00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.650
<v 0>You don't look like a good leader.
So don't fall for,
and you know what?</v>

638
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.250
I'm actually not saying that you'll never get fired if you take ownership

639
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.760
because you only,
if you do something that's really bad,

640
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.850
there's absolutely a chance you'd get fired.

641
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:50.800
If you do something that costs a bunch of money or was immoral or illegal,

642
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:54.520
or you covered something up and,
or your team covered something up,

643
00:38:54.521 --> 00:38:58.570
or you did something that was truly wrong and you take ownership of it,
yeah,

644
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.020
use might still get fired.
You know what that happens in the navy and the navy.

645
00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:05.680
If your ship runs aground or like lately there's been some collisions on the

646
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:06.540
ships and all that.

647
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.150
I think Lafe and I might talk about those at some point on the podcast,

648
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.570
but the captain of the ship is done.

649
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.130
It doesn't matter if he was on the ship or not.
Hmm.

650
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.080
He could be because just because the ships at sea,

651
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.290
the captain might have had to flown to another ship to talk to the admiral.

652
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.010
If his ship crashes,
he's done.
It doesn't matter if he's there or not.

653
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:29.470
He's responsible for the training.
He's responsible for the actions.

654
00:39:29.471 --> 00:39:31.180
He's responsible for everything that's happened on that ship.

655
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:37.030
And he's getting fired.
And He,
and,
and also if he did do something wrong,
well,

656
00:39:37.031 --> 00:39:39.550
yeah,
he's,
and he takes ownership of it doesn't matter.
He's getting fired.

657
00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.690
So I'm not saying you're never gonna get fired.
Um,
but generally,

658
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.461
generally,

659
00:39:45.461 --> 00:39:48.520
and this is when I say generally this is the vast majority of the time,

660
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:54.040
this is 99% of the time.
If you take ownership,
you don't look like a weak boss.

661
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:56.740
You look like a strong boss that is taking ownership of problems that is going

662
00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:59.080
to get the problem solved.
I say this over and over again.

663
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.880
<v 4>[inaudible]
Andy</v>

664
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.940
<v 0>as always,
you don't just have to own the problems.</v>

665
00:40:04.941 --> 00:40:06.920
You have to own the solutions to the problems too.
So

666
00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:12.680
this is the situation here.
We got this guy,
people,

667
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:16.790
if you're in charge of a bad team and you're taking ownership,

668
00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.530
the bad team is what you have to fix.
You have to fix it.
You have to train them,

669
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.010
you have to curve,
you have to coach them,
you have to mentor them.

670
00:40:25.011 --> 00:40:26.300
You have to do all those things.

671
00:40:26.301 --> 00:40:28.520
And if you can't get them to get on board with the program,

672
00:40:28.521 --> 00:40:32.600
then you've got to get rid of them or get rid of that one or two bad people that

673
00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:36.830
are causing the infraction and causing that cancer to spread.
Get rid of them.

674
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:38.121
Set the example.

675
00:40:38.121 --> 00:40:40.940
Promote somebody that's hungry and young and wants to get after it.

676
00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.153
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

677
00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.710
<v 0>So you got to take ownership of the team,</v>

678
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.370
the problems,
the weak people on the team.

679
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:55.550
You got to take ownership of the solutions and get them solved it seems like,

680
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.770
and it kind of notices from the beginning go that when you take,

681
00:41:01.771 --> 00:41:05.280
he was going to cut you off with,
I have to talk about this before.

682
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:09.060
Sometimes people say they think if they say,
I'll take ownership of this,

683
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.430
then the problems,
then it's like there had been,
they're safe.

684
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:15.270
That's exactly what you're saying.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That is not the case.

685
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.390
Just because you say,
Hey,
this is my fault.
It's my fault.

686
00:41:18.391 --> 00:41:21.450
I'm taking ownership with this.
That doesn't mean the problem's solved.

687
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:25.860
There's a problem.
Yeah.
You have to say,
yes,
there's a problem here.

688
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.150
I'm taking ownership of,

689
00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:30.510
it's my fault because I'm in charge and this is what we're going to do to fix
it.

690
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.070
And then you have to actually go and fix it.
There's the part right

691
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.990
<v 3>there.
Yeah,
that scene.
Because if you come to meet 12 times and you say,</v>

692
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:43.280
hey Jo Koy we didn't get the podcast out cause I forgot to hit record.

693
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.700
Hey that's my boss.
That's my boss.
Okay,
well hey from now on,

694
00:41:46.701 --> 00:41:47.540
here's when we're do,

695
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.670
I'm going to make sure that we have this things in place and I hooked up the

696
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:52.200
light and it's gonna if,
if the thing isn't recording the,

697
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:53.780
the studio is going to go dark.

698
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:58.880
I Dunno if you remember this because this might be just the way you are,

699
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:03.560
but when we went to remember
where do we go?

700
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:08.110
We went like last trip we went on driving,
we went to,
oh Charlie plumb.
Yeah,

701
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.250
I'm pretty sure it's really hard.
And we were looking for,

702
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.540
I can't remember what we were looking for either the hotel or the place or

703
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:16.820
wherever.
A house.

704
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.001
That was a good,

705
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:24.140
so we're going and I was kind of navigating and you were kind of navigating,

706
00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:26.300
kind of trying to help,
not trying to help,

707
00:42:26.301 --> 00:42:28.070
but you were kind of navigating but kind of nuts.

708
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.950
It really seemed like to me anyway,
you were like,
okay,

709
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:35.090
I'll let you kind of navigate and we uh,

710
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.970
we took a wrong turn,
whatever,
you know,
we're off track or whatever.
And

711
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.130
I was like,
okay,
I got to take extreme ownership right now.

712
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.330
Cause it's like right now it's like the perfect time to take action on it or it

713
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:53.870
should I say the worst time not to take a chain monitor.
Right.
So I'm like,
oh no,

714
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:56.420
that's my bad.
Like I'm gonna,
you know,
I'm going to do this kind of thing.

715
00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:01.580
But at the same time you like really aggressively took ownership.

716
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.640
Like you're almost to the point where at,
at first I was like,
are you joking?

717
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.160
But you weren't joking.
You were like,
take,

718
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.230
take the next turn right here and then we'd come close to it.

719
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:13.210
You'd be like this turn right here.
Turn around acute at all around.

720
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.660
You were not letting me,
you know,
make a mistake again,
but,
which is funny though,

721
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.710
but it is a good example because not only,

722
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.330
I mean in your mind you,
you put forward the more important part.

723
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.160
You were like,
okay,
I'm going to take,

724
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.310
it's like your actions said that it's your fault,

725
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:36.530
but you're the solutions that that you had even though they're really extreme or

726
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:37.280
whatever.

727
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.490
Like that was the part that you were imposing a jerk about it though was,

728
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.650
I don't know,
just,
okay.
All right.
Do you know what?
Here's the deal.

729
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.420
Next term's going to be 0.5 miles.
Here's coming up on the right.
All right.

730
00:43:46.421 --> 00:43:51.270
Right hand turn right here.
That's how,
that's how we navigate in the,

731
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:56.380
it's actually good.
I mean,
it's really squared away.
Yeah.

732
00:43:56.450 --> 00:44:01.370
You're in a convoy of military vehicles.
Yeah.
It's awesome.
And you know,

733
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:05.810
it's bad.
It's really on.
My part is that at first I thought you're joking,

734
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:08.120
like patronizing me,
you know?
No,
I'm don't do that.

735
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:12.410
But that's really kind of my ego.
You know,
as if this say like Duh.
I,

736
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:16.010
you said the next turn this the next to her and I can figure that out.
You know,

737
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.220
I'm smart enough to figure that out kind of thing.
But if I'm like,
okay,

738
00:44:19.221 --> 00:44:22.010
this is the system and you know,
Jack was going to,
you know,

739
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.760
tell me and he's going to be detailed about it and make absolutely sure we don't

740
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:29.000
miss the turn kind of thing,
then you're right.
Dang,

741
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:32.070
that's a good way to navigate,
you know,
but two people

742
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.700
<v 1>got to be on board,
but none the less like,
Dang,
you had the solution,
you know.</v>

743
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.450
So it goes back to it like it seems like back to this question,
um,

744
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.900
your enemies could take advantage early on,
right.
As it's,

745
00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:46.550
as the extreme ownership culture is trying to take hold kind of is what it kind

746
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.970
of get from it.
Um,
like even early on,
that's what I think

747
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.510
even early on you don't look like an idiot.

748
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.280
You actually look squared away because you go,

749
00:44:59.281 --> 00:45:02.460
here are the problems that we're having that I've identified.

750
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.380
Here's what we're going to do to fix them.
Yeah.

751
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.900
No one knows where we're driving right now.

752
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.270
You're kind of half driving and half paying attention.

753
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:13.350
I'm over here talking or doing whatever.
Guess what?
We made a mistake.

754
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.510
It's not going to happen again.
I got this.
Hey,
yeah,
right.

755
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:20.210
Turn coming up 500 meters,
right turn getting the left hand lane,
prepare to go.

756
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.030
You know what I mean?
That's what,

757
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:25.680
that's how we solved the problem and to think in the beginning,

758
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.590
you know,
you get there and you say,
hey,
here's the problem.

759
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:32.310
Here's what we're going to fix it.
It's not,
hey,
everything's my fault.

760
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:36.390
That's not extra.
Every extreme ownership isn't,
hey,
everything's my fault.

761
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.710
Everything's my fault

762
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.360
and how can you just leave me alone?
No,

763
00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:47.361
especially not in that actually have to take ownership of the problems.

764
00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.820
Said that over and over again,
but hey,
you know what?
Just like Jujitsu,

765
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.950
you got to see a move a bunch of different times,
a bunch of different ways.
Yeah.

766
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.500
Bunch of different ways before you start to truly understand it.
Yeah.

767
00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:06.060
Think that's everything.
Do you ever,
do you ever hear yourself make an excuse?
No.

768
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.380
I knew him or not anymore.
I know like,
you know,

769
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:13.200
like how you say you like you can feel it
coming out,

770
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.380
excuses coming a mile away.
And here's the thing,
you have them in your head,

771
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:21.930
excuse,
complaining,
um,
uh,
complain about like how you feel,
you know,

772
00:46:21.931 --> 00:46:24.060
like when there's something to be done.
I'm not saying,
you know,

773
00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:26.190
in every single case,
but when there's something to be done and be like,

774
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.460
I'm tired of doing this or I don't know,
whatever.
That was just a random example.

775
00:46:29.461 --> 00:46:32.650
But man,
I can see that stuff coming a mile away.
Yeah,

776
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:38.330
it's definitely something that you get used to and you get good at.

777
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:43.500
Right.
You get good at,
you're good at saying,
you get good at not saying,

778
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.180
well,
you know,

779
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:52.830
one of my assistant platoon commanders,
who's an awesome guy,

780
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.520
and he had this thing,
if he was going to disagree with me,

781
00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:02.070
he would say the word well meaning,
you know,

782
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:06.360
well let's think about it.
But he had a funny way of saying it.
He would say,
Whoa,

783
00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:11.230
like that.
And so I'd say,
Hey,
we,

784
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.970
you know,
how you going to do this?
And he'd come up with his plan and,

785
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:17.720
and I'd say,
Hey,
what about this on the plan?
You will,

786
00:47:17.721 --> 00:47:20.010
you might want to come in from the north and said from the West.
And he'd go,

787
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:20.844
well,

788
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:27.020
and then I'd say after a while that became a code word for you're about to get

789
00:47:27.781 --> 00:47:28.614
chills.

790
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:36.430
<v 0>But he's a total,
he's an awesome guy.
Check.
Well,</v>

791
00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.410
tell me yours next west

792
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:47.920
Jocko have had discipline equals freedom audio on repeat since its release.

793
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.580
And I love it.
Question,
if our greatest strength is our greatest weakness,

794
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.940
then how is discipline,
which is obviously your,
your strength,

795
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:02.110
your greatest weakness.
Uh,
first of all,

796
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:03.840
<v 2>okay.</v>

797
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.920
<v 0>I don't even know what,
I don't know if discipline would be my greatest strength.</v>

798
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:11.580
I don't know.
I mean,
I'm a disciplined person.
Yeah,
no doubt.

799
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.180
But I think it,
I think that,

800
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:16.800
<v 2>okay.</v>

801
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.460
<v 0>I think that one of the things that people would find interesting is that</v>

802
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.350
I'm not overly orderly

803
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:26.603
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

804
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.740
<v 0>So if you think about those like psychological characteristics,</v>

805
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:32.930
one of them is extreme orderliness,

806
00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.200
which normally goes hand in hand with highly disciplined to people.

807
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:39.120
None of those people that are,
um,

808
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:44.000
they're just old tra.
Highly disciplined,

809
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:47.690
but they have to have everything there.
They're OCD,

810
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.560
they're OCD orderly,
right?
Yeah.
And I,

811
00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:56.540
I'm not like that about a lot of things.
I am about some things,

812
00:48:56.541 --> 00:48:58.550
but like it's pretty funny actually.

813
00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:03.610
My floor in my garage where I work out isn't,

814
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.090
is not clean.
Right?
It's got salt stains on it from sweat soft.

815
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:14.290
Oh yeah.
And it's dirty.
Right?
And occasionally we'll get someone say,

816
00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:18.620
you should clean that floor or a man,
you screwed the poor man.
That's nasty.

817
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:20.960
But it totally functional.
Right.

818
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:25.580
And my point is that I don't,
I don't freak out about it.

819
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:30.320
It's functional.
It doesn't bother me at all.
That's not perfectly orderly.

820
00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.580
This also means that I don't mind when things don't go as planned,
right?

821
00:49:34.581 --> 00:49:37.970
So a lot of times you get people that are the high end of disciplined.
Yeah,

822
00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:40.130
they're too,
they're too far.
They're not balanced.

823
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:42.350
So now when things don't go the way that they're,

824
00:49:42.351 --> 00:49:45.590
that they've planned things to go,
the the,
they start to lose it a little bit.

825
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.450
They can't deal with it.
They want,

826
00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.450
they want to have everything in order all the time.

827
00:49:50.451 --> 00:49:51.860
And I'll tell you that's not the way life works.

828
00:49:51.861 --> 00:49:56.030
That's certainly not the way combat works,
but that's not the way life works.

829
00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.480
And I don't really mind that.
I don't mind chaos.

830
00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:03.920
So I would say probably if,

831
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:08.540
if you look at discipline as a strength,
I don't think,

832
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:13.040
I think that would be generally considered the weaknesses of,

833
00:50:13.041 --> 00:50:16.010
of being hyper disciplined is that you,

834
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:20.690
you can't stand when things are not going to order.
You can't stand like,

835
00:50:20.691 --> 00:50:25.000
I missed a workout.
This is our,
they'll grow.
You freak out completely.
Like,

836
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.220
did you know,
okay,
I don't like missing a workout,
but I don't lose

837
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.660
<v 1>my mind over it.
Yeah.
Now.
All that being said,</v>

838
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:38.830
I would say that I am a very much a creature of habit and I do like to do the

839
00:50:38.991 --> 00:50:40.910
same things over and over again.
I like to travel,

840
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.130
even though I have to travel all the time.
I don't lecture.
I'd rather stay home.

841
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.770
I pretty much eat the same food all the time and go to the same three or four

842
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:51.500
restaurants all the time.
Right.

843
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.930
I like to follow routine as much as I can.
You know,
it's even in Jujitsu,

844
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:02.060
I do the same basic movements all the time.
I have the same,
you know,

845
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:05.720
I've talked about like a funnel,
like everywhere that you go with me,

846
00:51:05.721 --> 00:51:09.020
it's going to lead to where I want you to be because I'm going to use those same

847
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:13.790
moves,
surf the same spots all the time.
So I guess,

848
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.130
I guess for me,

849
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.610
the way that discipline is weakness or whatever for me is that it may,

850
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:21.463
I think I'm,

851
00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:26.210
I can be fairly boring and predictable for other people.

852
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:30.980
Yeah,
yeah.
You know,
people say,
Hey,

853
00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:35.440
you want to go try this thing?
And I'm like,
oh no,
not really.
Not really.
Yeah.

854
00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.610
Don't really want to.
I think you're right about that though.

855
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:42.440
Cause I'm the same thing even are you the same way?
Exact same way,
bro.

856
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:46.970
Like I,
I'm not highly disciplined.
Echo Charles,
highly disciplined.
I mean,

857
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:50.510
but like the same stuff over and over again.
The,

858
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:56.300
it's funny I go to,
I don't even like new movies.
Oh Dang.

859
00:51:56.301 --> 00:51:59.000
Okay.
Like,
Oh,
you know what?

860
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.830
I haven't had time to watch movies for a long time,
but,

861
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.480
but when I used to watch movies and be like,
okay,

862
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:08.600
I'm going to watch the big Lebowski again.
Yeah,
we'll have that kind of to,

863
00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:12.410
I think big Lebowski is the kind of move you then,
okay,
so movies are different.

864
00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:14.030
I'm going to go into a whole thing about this,

865
00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:18.920
but there's two types of different mu two types of movies in this situation.

866
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:22.010
There's movies that are like,
oh awesome,
good storyline,

867
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.430
maybe a great reveal at the end or twist or whatever.
And it's like,
good,

868
00:52:25.431 --> 00:52:26.264
good story.

869
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:30.410
And then there's like the type of movie that's just a series of good parts where

870
00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:32.570
the story,
it doesn't really matter that much.
Some of that was good,

871
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:33.890
some of the junk,
but it's less about that.

872
00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:36.840
It's more about like the good parts is like,
oh,
this part in this way.

873
00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:40.340
That's how the big Lebowski is like it's just a series of really good parts.

874
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.130
Yeah,
and it's awesome.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I mean.

875
00:52:43.131 --> 00:52:45.410
I think they're both awesome,
but the,
the ones that have,

876
00:52:45.411 --> 00:52:49.030
what was the other one that just the storylines awesome.
Like you know,
like,
um,

877
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.040
I can't think of anything off top of my head,

878
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:54.560
but big Lebowski is one of those ones you'd like Napoleon dynamite.

879
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.620
Like that's another one.
It's just a bunch of good parts.

880
00:52:57.621 --> 00:53:00.590
Who cares about what happens within,
in fact,
you probably forget really.

881
00:53:00.591 --> 00:53:02.910
I mean you remember what happened at the end of this for the storyline.

882
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:03.763
You don't really care,

883
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:07.040
but you'll watch it over and over because all the parts are funny or good or

884
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:11.520
whatever.
And then like point break for example.
I know we talked about the first,

885
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.690
yeah.
Yeah,
that's a good,
that's a series of great parts.

886
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:18.130
Like I certainly more the skydiving part that we'll give him of the all the
part.

887
00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:21.500
They're just really fun.
I mean sure the story is good.
It's cool.
It's fine.

888
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:26.100
We'll say that,
but that's not the point.
The point is like,
you know,
anyway,
Jack,

889
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:30.420
<v 3>back to the point though is oh,
when we were talking about like being repetitive,</v>

890
00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:34.230
like,
like in the same thing over and over.
It's boring.
Boring,
boring,
boring.
Yeah.

891
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.150
Cause I,
okay,
so I'm like that right?

892
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:39.120
Where I eat a lot of Sushi all the time and there's a Sushi restaurant within

893
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:41.780
walking distance of my house.
Like it's like borderline drive,

894
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:45.600
but I go there like not as much as I probably go like maybe three times a week

895
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:49.800
now.
But there is a point where I was going five to six days a week for real and

896
00:53:49.801 --> 00:53:52.630
there'd be times where I'd go more than once in a day.
Yeah.
Day.

897
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:57.450
So of course they just love me and,
and my brother goes to,

898
00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:01.370
so yeah,
they just love me in there.
Who's like,
oh,
again,
again,
we're just pretty,

899
00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:03.780
no,
probably responsible for a significant portion of their revenue.

900
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.610
My wife,
she's not like that.
Oh,
she likes the different minister,

901
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:12.710
the same variety and whatever.
And so my wife will say,
you know,
well,

902
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:15.690
let's say we're going to go out for dinner.
Yeah.
That's try something different.

903
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:21.200
I said,
okay,
tell me where.
Yes,

904
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:24.690
when we just go to old faithfuls.
Yeah,
yeah.

905
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:27.950
At least you have a few like different spots I have,

906
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.040
I have two and they're both Sushi places.
So it's like,
I mean,

907
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.770
and it goes for like what we do too during the weekend.

908
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.240
It's like really repetitive.

909
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:40.320
My wife uses the word groundhog day planning like a lot too.

910
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:44.730
If he can have great movies,
great parts,
a bunch of great parts.

911
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.760
But really who cares at the end,
you know,
like the story.
What's that?

912
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.170
What's that movie really about though?

913
00:54:49.171 --> 00:54:52.950
What's the story about that movie you didn't know?
Yeah,
I totally know.

914
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.530
I've seen it look fun.
You gotta be nice to the girls.

915
00:54:55.531 --> 00:54:58.730
So the ground hall outdate stops like,
well,
I don't know what the,

916
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.260
it doesn't even make sense what I did,
but it's a good movie anyway.

917
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.650
So that was the point of the makeup with the loose fitting.
But,
um,
but yeah,

918
00:55:07.651 --> 00:55:10.620
so the point is with this is that yeah,

919
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:14.430
you will be boring because my wife thinks I'm born in that way where it's like,

920
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:16.590
it's just the same old,
same old every single time.
I'm like,

921
00:55:16.591 --> 00:55:17.780
probably I love the same old thing.

922
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:21.030
I want to travel home to go onto this all inclusive thing or whatever.

923
00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.830
This is just the whole like,
wait,
this is like way better,
you know?
And Yeah.
So,

924
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.450
yeah,
I think you're right.
I think that might be,

925
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:31.050
but so if you think discipline isn't your biggest strength,
what is,

926
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.990
what do you think your biggest strength is?
I don't know.

927
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.670
I don't think I have any real big strength.
You know what I think it is?

928
00:55:35.671 --> 00:55:39.630
I think it's arguable.
Maybe discipline.
Yeah.
Maybe,
maybe not.

929
00:55:39.631 --> 00:55:43.980
But you know what actually balance.
Yep.
Oh man,
you're imbalanced.

930
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:49.140
Nope.
You're pretty balanced.
Yeah.
You know,
I think it is,

931
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:54.060
you told it to me too.
Oh,
your durable.
Oh,

932
00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:57.420
in terms of physical,
I think even mental too though.
That's the thing.

933
00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:00.960
Like you're,
you're like a durable pro.
You know how like people like you,

934
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.600
you've told me stories,
obviously what I'm going to them.

935
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:07.110
But you told me stories about someone who made like huge mistakes,
you know,

936
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:12.140
with you and you like handle it and it doesn't seem like it bothers you.

937
00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:17.210
You don't like that can stuff stuff that like,
yeah,
no I do well and you know,

938
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:21.690
to me,
I guess that's,
that's balanced to me,
but to me balances,
I don't,

939
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:26.370
I don't,
it's,
it's,
it's also boring,
right?

940
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.170
Cause I don't go far in one direction the other direction.

941
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:33.330
I don't get extreme about this or extreme about that.
I just,
I,

942
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:38.450
I think that's what has been good for me was I never freak out about stuff much,

943
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:42.520
much.
Yeah.
Some stuff.

944
00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.130
<v 2>Yeah.
That,
yeah.
That makes sense.</v>

945
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:53.220
<v 3>Nick's question,
what's your biggest strength?
My biggest strength.</v>

946
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:56.890
I'll tell you what I think you're,
his biggest strength is one.
You're humble,

947
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:00.010
you're super humble.
Yeah.
That can get help.

948
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.940
Just the other day you were telling me you are the most humble guys in the
world.

949
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.710
Nobody's more humble than me.
That was

950
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:13.090
so funny though.
I forget who said that joke,
but yeah.
Yeah.
Me,

951
00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:13.590
I had a,

952
00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:18.280
I had one of the most egotistical persons that I've ever known.

953
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:23.530
Like I am not kidding about this.
Yeah.
Straight up.
Tell me.

954
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:27.760
I have no ego.
I mean it was,
it was like,

955
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:32.050
it was completely insane.
I couldn't believe that,

956
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.620
that this individual was saying it and I was just thinking to myself,
man,

957
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.720
that's crazy.
Ego Is,
here's the thing.
I don't know who you're talking about,

958
00:57:40.721 --> 00:57:45.690
but specifically,
but um,
I will say this where obviously I wasn't all,

959
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.593
I don't,

960
00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:51.400
and this may even go along with the idea that you think that humble is like,

961
00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:52.510
I don't even know if,

962
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:57.690
if I'm humble or not because I know before I wasn't humble before at all.

963
00:57:57.821 --> 00:58:02.210
I thought the world revolved around,
not necessarily like a bad way,
but just,

964
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:06.400
just,
just how.
Yeah.
It's Kinda like if I had certain feelings,

965
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:09.430
like they were just more important than what was kinda going on.

966
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.460
And it wasn't like necessarily like errr like walking,
you know,

967
00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:14.740
like a dick or nothing like that.
It was just,

968
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:19.720
that's kind of how I felt or whatever.
And um,
you know,
complete immaturity.

969
00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:23.940
But at the same time,
when you,

970
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.060
when you kind of pointed out that humility is like a super important thing,

971
00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:30.030
I was like,
okay,
how can I,
how can I,
I mean,
okay,

972
00:58:30.031 --> 00:58:32.640
I'm going to assume that's true because you know what you're talking about.

973
00:58:32.641 --> 00:58:36.150
So what does that even mean?
And then what I realized is a big,

974
00:58:36.151 --> 00:58:40.950
like a way to exemplify humility is to,
to,
I dunno,

975
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:45.450
the ability to learn things from someone who might not necessarily be an expert,

976
00:58:45.451 --> 00:58:46.284
for example.

977
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

978
00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:52.330
<v 3>I think you can learn stuff from a kid,
from a blue belt.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

979
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.010
And so from a white belt,
yeah.
So that kind of stuff.

980
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:59.420
But someone with ego or we'll be like,
hey,
I'm a black belt,

981
00:58:59.421 --> 00:59:02.600
so for sure.
What do you have to say to me?
You know,
gee,
you know,
that concept,

982
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.381
that idea.
Well,

983
00:59:03.381 --> 00:59:06.800
interestingly in Jujitsu you could take it to the extreme of where there was

984
00:59:06.801 --> 00:59:10.220
times where people fought.
You can't learn anything from wrestlers.

985
00:59:10.221 --> 00:59:13.360
You can't learn anything from judo.
You can't learn anything from samba.
You,

986
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:17.090
you know,
that's,
that's,
that's crazy talk,
you know?
And,
and the good,

987
00:59:17.091 --> 00:59:20.420
you did two players take it something from wrestling and take something from

988
00:59:20.421 --> 00:59:22.070
Judah,
take a,
from wrestling a bunch from

989
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:23.920
<v 1>general bonds from sambal or,
but,</v>

990
00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.400
and then create their own stuff and watch on youtube somebody that does other

991
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:31.370
stuff from a different academy at different school.
Yeah.

992
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.480
So it's almost like there's two different types of humility where,
you know,

993
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:38.750
how like someone who's really outwardly like,
um,
you actually,

994
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:42.150
you had this example where like Conor McGregor for example,
we're out,

995
00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:44.870
like to hear them talk and stuff like that,
you'd be like,
Oh,

996
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:47.240
this guy has a huge ego and there's no humble,

997
00:59:47.241 --> 00:59:48.710
there's no humility with them whenever,

998
00:59:48.711 --> 00:59:51.390
but like he's learning all this stuff from like people you'd be like,
oh,

999
00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:55.700
he's training hard.
Yeah.
Because he knows he's,

1000
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.190
he's humble.
Yeah.
So what does that,
you know,

1001
00:59:58.191 --> 01:00:02.180
like is there two kinds of humbleness and your humility?
I think they're kind of,

1002
01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:06.350
and even if we were to look at it,
there's some level of showmanship with Connor,

1003
01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:08.600
right?
There's some level of selling fights with Connor,

1004
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.230
but even at the same time like let's say that because there's such thing as

1005
01:00:12.231 --> 01:00:12.770
people,

1006
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:16.310
probably pretty common that people are legitimately like into themselves in that

1007
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:17.150
way.
Which category?

1008
01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:20.670
We're going to have coach cabin on this podcast at some point.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1009
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:24.540
Cause I've gone back and forth with him on social media.
Yeah,

1010
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.080
that'd be awesome.
Yeah.

1011
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.010
But he could answer that question very well.
Yeah.

1012
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.900
Just in general or about Connor?
Yeah,
about Connor.

1013
01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:37.550
He goes Connor product better than anybody.

1014
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:43.020
But you get people who are legitimately cocky outwardly,
you know,
Kinda like er,

1015
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.140
but,
but at the same time they can learn from,

1016
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.770
they have the humility to learn from everyone kind of thing.

1017
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.530
And you know what it is almost even,

1018
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.220
it might not even be necessarily specifically being able to learn from everyone.

1019
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.580
It's more about what you said long time ago.

1020
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.780
It's like admitting to yourself that you don't know everything yet and you don't

1021
01:01:02.781 --> 01:01:05.240
necessarily know more than everyone at every single time.

1022
01:01:05.241 --> 01:01:07.820
It's like you have to be humble enough to know that you don't know everything.

1023
01:01:07.821 --> 01:01:11.420
So listen up kind of fat is the type of thing where even

1024
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:18.190
so I will catch myself and I used to catch myself doing that,

1025
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.480
let's say once a day and then,

1026
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.630
and then it was once a week and there's once a month and,
and,
and,

1027
01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:30.680
and it's pretty,
it's a less now,
but sometimes I'll,
I'll,

1028
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:34.760
I'll catch myself listening to someone and I'll catch myself thinking,
oh,

1029
01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:36.350
this guy does know what he's talking about.
You know what I mean?

1030
01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.940
And as soon as I hear myself sounding and wait a second,

1031
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.750
take a different perspective because you,
what can you not,

1032
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.740
not this guy doesn't know anything.
It's what can you learn from this person?

1033
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.980
That's the question.
Yeah.
What can you learn from it?

1034
01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:52.610
You can learn something from him,
even if he's a white belt.

1035
01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.480
Even if he's inexperienced,
even if he seems completely arrogant and crazy.

1036
01:01:56.990 --> 01:02:01.940
Even if you're learning how not to act.
Yeah.
That's better than just saying,

1037
01:02:01.941 --> 01:02:06.140
oh this person,
oh no listeners person,
I've got nothing to learn.
No you do.
I do.

1038
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:10.190
So I,
it's interesting as we talked about how you make excuses,

1039
01:02:10.191 --> 01:02:13.640
you personally make excuses last.
Now I personally make excuses.

1040
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:15.450
I might be a little ahead of you.
I'm happy cause I can,

1041
01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.500
I figured that out maybe a little bit earlier and I'm older than you,

1042
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:24.120
but it's,
you know,
I used to probably make excuses once,

1043
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.560
once a day.
Yeah.

1044
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:30.770
And then once every three days and then once a week and it comes in plenty,

1045
01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:35.010
many forms to the home making excuses cause it doesn't necessarily only mean

1046
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:39.480
making excuses to others.
It's like to yourself.
For sure.
For sure.

1047
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:42.540
That's the primary.
Yeah.
That's the primary,

1048
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:45.300
the easy one to overcome is making excuses to other people.

1049
01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:50.340
The hard one overcome is making excuses to yourself.
That's the hard one.

1050
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:54.180
Overcome.
Cause it hurts more.
Yeah.
Because the minute you say,
well,
you know,

1051
01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:59.181
I didn't get to the thing I wanted because of all these external forces,

1052
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.090
external forces,

1053
01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:07.440
the minute you start saying that is the minute that you stop working hard for

1054
01:03:07.441 --> 01:03:08.250
that thing,

1055
01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:11.850
when maneuvering for that thing or adjusting for that thing or getting up early

1056
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:16.140
and chasing that thing down,
it becomes an excuse,
an excuse.

1057
01:03:16.141 --> 01:03:18.890
It becomes an excuse like meaning who just excused you.

1058
01:03:18.891 --> 01:03:22.860
So who did you just excuse yourself from that workout?
Um,
yeah,

1059
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.310
but how would say back to the humility thing,
and I don't know,

1060
01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:30.180
I'm just listening to you at this point where maybe I am,

1061
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:34.770
because I've always had had at least a little bit of that where it'd be like

1062
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.950
maybe this person right now,
even though I hate what they're saying to me,

1063
01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:42.240
like they could be right,
it could be right about me right now.

1064
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.290
And I think always had that.
I think that's why,
you know,
some people,
they just,

1065
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.110
you talk to me Norman,
whatever,
and you're like,

1066
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.300
the chance of this person changing how they are is very low.
Most people,

1067
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.800
most most people,
right?
And most people start to change my experience too.

1068
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.080
But yeah,

1069
01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:03.690
something either really big or something really small has to happen over and

1070
01:04:03.691 --> 01:04:05.880
over and over.
Don't do this in a different for sure.

1071
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.030
But I would say legitimately,

1072
01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:11.400
and I'm trying to look at it as honestly as possible.

1073
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:14.100
Where me 10 years ago is like,

1074
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.600
like if let's say I know someone I knew someone 10 years ago and I haven't seen

1075
01:04:18.601 --> 01:04:23.370
him or heard from him or whatever in 10 years and they like hung out with me for

1076
01:04:23.371 --> 01:04:26.910
a week,
they would be blown away.
They'd be like,
you're just way different.

1077
01:04:26.911 --> 01:04:30.870
There's like a whole different person.
It's the same with me.
I mean,
so,

1078
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.750
so this is funny.
There's a bar in San Diego sure.

1079
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.320
That I used to go to when I was back in the teams and of course,

1080
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:44.330
yes.
And I was a wild,
yeah,
I was a wild.
Yeah.

1081
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.040
And there was a guy that was,
uh,

1082
01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.910
a Dj there and I didn't even know.
It didn't record.
I was,

1083
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:56.220
I was usually not in a state to even be paying attention to those kind of things

1084
01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.020
anyways.
To make a long story short,

1085
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:03.410
I decided I was going to put it in an officer package and I put together the

1086
01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:08.631
package and I went into the administrative office at seal team one and I talked

1087
01:05:08.911 --> 01:05:12.510
to the chief that was in there and I said,
hey,
how are you doing chief?
You know,

1088
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.620
I'm putting in this package.

1089
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.590
And I was just wanting you to take a look at it and you know,

1090
01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:18.190
if there's anything you see I should add.

1091
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:22.840
<v 0>And he looked at me,
he goes,
I hear putting in a package,
Huh?
And I said,
yeah.</v>

1092
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:26.410
And he goes,
oh that's,
I wouldn't expect that for me it's the phrasing.

1093
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:30.040
And I was kind of why not?
He goes,
w usually know I'm the,

1094
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:34.300
I'm the DJ on this bar on,

1095
01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:39.070
on these nights.
And I've been that for five years.
And I said,

1096
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.840
I was not aware of that.
And you know,

1097
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.510
in his mind he was thinking that's what he knew me as.

1098
01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:48.670
He didn't really know me cause he's in the admin office.

1099
01:05:48.671 --> 01:05:51.250
He wouldn't really know me from anything else.

1100
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.080
And that was a little bit of a wakeup call,
but that,
so my point is

1101
01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:02.650
I want to,
I should not,
I should never come off as a saint

1102
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.570
for sure,
for sure.
Not at all.
And even,
you know,

1103
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.710
to this day still working and still trying to figure things out.
But,

1104
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:17.260
but definitely back in the day I was an idiot.
I had fun,

1105
01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:22.870
I had fun,
but I was did a lot of dumb stuff.
But you're,
I mean,

1106
01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.490
and I,

1107
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:29.670
I believe you 100% where you were probably a certain way back then and you know,

1108
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:33.640
whatever it fit,
it was fun.
It was all this or whatever and,

1109
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:38.670
but you legitimately changed a bunch or a big part of fundamentally who you are

1110
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:44.100
with being open to like critique and criticism and learn and whatever.

1111
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.220
And I think,
yeah,

1112
01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:52.960
I think the biggest thing is I had open eyes,
you know what I mean?

1113
01:06:52.961 --> 01:06:55.360
And as I moved into leadership positions,
when I saw,

1114
01:06:55.390 --> 01:07:00.390
I saw how other people perceived me and I saw the importance of leadership and

1115
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:06.040
yeah,
I mean you just,
you just have to change.

1116
01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:10.570
And that's something that as a leader you,
you see this all the time.

1117
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:15.310
What got you here isn't necessarily what's going to get you there.
Right?

1118
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.110
And so if you have leaders that

1119
01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:22.330
if they were aggressive golden cowboy when they were out in the field,

1120
01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.930
that's great,
but will you,
can you,
you have to,
you don't have to stop that,

1121
01:07:25.931 --> 01:07:27.880
but you have to put some rains on it.
You have to,

1122
01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:30.220
you have to reign it in a little bit.
The more senior you get,

1123
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:32.830
the more you become accountable to a board,

1124
01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:36.970
the more you become accountable to being a publicly traded company.

1125
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:38.260
Those are the things that were real.

1126
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:42.400
And the more you become accountable to the actions.

1127
01:07:42.401 --> 01:07:45.370
If you're in the military still in Wa,
the way you're going to be seen,
the way,

1128
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:50.371
the way your unit is going to be seen and perceived by other senior leaders.

1129
01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:52.960
Those are real things.
And if you don't grow up,

1130
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:56.020
you don't make the progress that you need to make.
Yeah.

1131
01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:58.540
And I was lucky enough to see that.
You know,

1132
01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:01.690
I had some great examples along the way.
Great leaders that I worked for,

1133
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.760
but it can be hard to see that.
Yeah,
that's a good like expression.

1134
01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:11.170
When you said I,
I opened my eyes or I went in with open eyes,

1135
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:16.100
I don't even know how to describe it,
but

1136
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:21.400
<v 1>I just was aware of what was happening a little bit more of than normal or a</v>

1137
01:08:23.961 --> 01:08:28.670
little bit enough to make the changes,
I guess.
Yeah.
And that's the hard part,

1138
01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:32.780
right?
And I think it is because of,
like I said,
like your,
your ego.

1139
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:35.850
And it's hard for me to even really say that because like even when I say the

1140
01:08:35.851 --> 01:08:37.610
word ego,
it really like it,

1141
01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:41.720
it registers as like this external at the guy walking around with his chest out

1142
01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:44.480
and I dunno his Mohawk,
I dunno,
whatever.

1143
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:47.360
It's like that it's an external expression,
but it's not,
it's like,

1144
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:54.580
it's like being able to kind of shed the blinders on self critique.

1145
01:08:55.851 --> 01:08:58.070
And so,
you know,
when someone sells you,
hey,
like you're,

1146
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:02.510
you're kind of acting this way or you're kind of this way and to be able to be,

1147
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:08.390
to figure to yourself that this person could be right first and then be mad at

1148
01:09:08.391 --> 01:09:11.000
the fact that they just insulted you second of course.

1149
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.120
Cause that's gonna be part of it.
I understand.
But most times for,

1150
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:18.800
I think most people and me included sometimes where the fact that you stepped to

1151
01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:23.480
me like that impacts me more than what you're actually saying can.
I mean,

1152
01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:27.380
but if you don't have the,
the ego in the way that you describe it,
you'll,

1153
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.080
you'll hear what they're saying first and then decide whether or not to be mad

1154
01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:37.550
at it.
You know what else is weird too,
is like,
as I talk about this stuff,
like,

1155
01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:41.510
like when I talk about detachment now,
I used to,

1156
01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:46.700
I used to not know that word when I would tell guys to do it.
This is even,

1157
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:49.370
you know,
not that long ago,
you know,

1158
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:54.430
but I was still in the teams but it took me a while and the teams while I was

1159
01:09:54.741 --> 01:09:58.580
trying to tell guys that,
but I didn't figure out the words yet,

1160
01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.580
you know,
you got you.
And that's just one example.

1161
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.250
There's a bunch of examples like that where I was trying to convey him,

1162
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:07.910
I would convey the message,

1163
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:12.410
but I didn't just have like a concise way to do it or a clear way to do it.

1164
01:10:12.411 --> 01:10:17.411
But I was still conveying the same message and maybe it,

1165
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:20.840
and that's another thing that happens is as you get older and you get more

1166
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:24.560
experienced,
you understand the message yourself better.

1167
01:10:24.561 --> 01:10:27.680
Just like when you teach Jiu Jitsu or you teach anything,
the more you teach it,

1168
01:10:27.681 --> 01:10:31.880
the better you understand it.
And so as I taught things,
I understood it better.

1169
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.460
And so that's one thing that I think helps out a lot.

1170
01:10:34.461 --> 01:10:35.640
And this is why it's an exam,

1171
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.280
an answer from me on so many different things with leadership.
People say,
well,

1172
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:41.600
what do I do with this young person that doesn't listen to what do I do?

1173
01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:44.060
This person that isn't reaching their potential and was like,

1174
01:10:44.061 --> 01:10:46.180
well put them in charge of stuff.
Cause that's what I,

1175
01:10:46.181 --> 01:10:51.181
that's what I think helped me a lot was even in my first platoon when I was the

1176
01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:54.830
youngest guy and I was the most junior guy in my first platoon,
I was the,

1177
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:58.760
I was the head radio man,

1178
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:01.470
which meant I was responsible for stuff I,

1179
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:04.090
which meant I sat through the briefs and I had to help with the planning.

1180
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:09.130
I had to do like stuff that was outside my realm of experience and I had to step

1181
01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:12.980
up and do it.
And it seems like a little thing right now,

1182
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.950
but it will tell you what,

1183
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 0>when you're 19 years old and you're in charge of the communications for some</v>

1184
01:11:18.181 --> 01:11:21.450
training exercise and you don't know what the hell you're doing,

1185
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.770
step up and figure that stuff out.
Yeah.
And that's,
that's very,
very impactful.

1186
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:28.620
So that's what you do with your junior leaders that you want to have them step

1187
01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:30.540
up and lead.
You put them in charge of things.

1188
01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:34.860
You put that and that was very lucky that I had leaders that I worked for that

1189
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:36.480
did that and I've talked about him before.

1190
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:39.960
I mean they had leaders that that put myself and the other junior guys and

1191
01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.490
platoons in charge of things.

1192
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:45.030
Not just not just saying what but actually putting us in charge of things and

1193
01:11:45.031 --> 01:11:46.660
that that's a quick way to grow leaders.

1194
01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:50.310
So I was very lucky that I had that and I think that was one of the things that

1195
01:11:50.311 --> 01:11:55.311
help me to see the light right was being put in Georgia things even at a young,

1196
01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.060
younger age.
When do you think like how you,

1197
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:01.980
how you just talk about detaching right?

1198
01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:05.130
Where you were trying to convey that message before you even called it detaching

1199
01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:05.964
or whatever.

1200
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:10.200
When did you understand the importance of,

1201
01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:12.000
I've told the story before and here is I was,

1202
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:17.030
I was doing oil rigs training and we came up on a platform and have an oil rig

1203
01:12:17.311 --> 01:12:20.170
there.
There are different platforms or different levels I should say.
Yeah,

1204
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.370
and we came up on this one platform.
I was,
I think this was,
this was in my,

1205
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:28.110
I'm trying to think of was my first or second platoon.

1206
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:32.940
I'm pretty sure it was my second platoon.
And as we came up on this,

1207
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:33.923
this level,

1208
01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:34.720
<v 2>okay.</v>

1209
01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.240
<v 0>It was,
it was a little confusing.</v>

1210
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.970
And did the whole platoon gets online and no one does anything.
I,

1211
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:44.380
I basically stood there for a second and then I kind of stepped back off the

1212
01:12:44.381 --> 01:12:48.070
line of,
but when I looked around and I said,
okay,
I see what we should do.

1213
01:12:48.071 --> 01:12:52.120
And I actually said,
hold left clear,
right.
Or whatever this little call was,

1214
01:12:52.121 --> 01:12:53.050
and everyone did it.

1215
01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:57.580
And the only reason I understood that was because I stepped back like a foot and

1216
01:12:57.581 --> 01:13:01.000
looked around and that's all you,
that's,
and I realized right then,
Oh,

1217
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:05.080
if I'm not staring down my gun,
if I take a step back,
if I look around,

1218
01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:08.140
if I detach,
I didn't use that word because I didn't know that word.
Right,
right.

1219
01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.050
But I said,
Oh,
if you just step back and you high port,
you're gunning,

1220
01:13:11.051 --> 01:13:13.540
you look around,
you're going to know way more than anybody else.

1221
01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:18.130
That staring down,
they're gone.
And that right there changed my world.

1222
01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:18.911
It really did.

1223
01:13:18.911 --> 01:13:21.580
It changed my world and at the time I didn't think that changed my world.

1224
01:13:21.581 --> 01:13:25.810
I just said,
oh cool.
You know what?
When we,
yeah,
when people are are frozen,

1225
01:13:25.811 --> 01:13:28.480
take a step back and look around and make a call.
Okay,
that's cool.

1226
01:13:28.481 --> 01:13:31.120
That's what I started doing.
I didn't think it was a big deal at the time.

1227
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:35.290
I didn't think it was a big deal until I was an instructor position and I would

1228
01:13:35.291 --> 01:13:40.090
see everyone staring down their gun and no one making decision and all I'd have

1229
01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:42.040
to do is tell someone,
hey,
you take a step back with me right here.

1230
01:13:42.041 --> 01:13:45.160
One foot back off the firing line and look around and they'd go,
okay,

1231
01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:47.560
we can go to this burn right here and we'll be out.
Okay.
Yeah,
that's right.

1232
01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.870
Then I started to realize how important it was and I started to put words around

1233
01:13:52.871 --> 01:13:57.220
it and put,
put messaging around it that it was important.
And there's an,

1234
01:13:57.221 --> 01:14:02.110
every lesson that I talk about was all kind of learned in that method.

1235
01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:02.620
Yeah.

1236
01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:06.940
All that was kind of learned by being put in situations where I had to figure

1237
01:14:06.941 --> 01:14:08.440
something out or something occurred or,

1238
01:14:08.441 --> 01:14:11.920
or I you and that's the same thing with my life will go put in some situations.

1239
01:14:11.921 --> 01:14:14.970
I said,
okay,
you know what and what,

1240
01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:19.980
what I think might be kind of key about that particular idea of detaching is

1241
01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.800
when you can detach in life,
right?

1242
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:30.850
It gives you this incredible ability to see yourself.

1243
01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:33.870
And I think that if we go down to the core of,

1244
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:38.890
of myself improving as a leader and continuing to try and improve as a leader,

1245
01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:44.670
it's because if you can detach and see yourself,

1246
01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:49.030
cause that's the same exact thing.
Like I mentioned this earlier,
I said,
you know,

1247
01:14:49.031 --> 01:14:52.180
I kind of saw myself and saw how other guys were seeing me.
Well,

1248
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:55.750
you've got to detach from.
But in order to see how other people are seeing you,

1249
01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.840
you've got to be able to detach a little bit and understand it.

1250
01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:04.170
And so that ability to step back and see myself from other people's,

1251
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:11.740
to see myself in situations and see how other people were interacting with me

1252
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:13.570
was very,
very helpful.
Now,

1253
01:15:13.571 --> 01:15:18.571
this does not mean that I was able to just correct course overnight,

1254
01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:21.460
and I don't want to make that,
you know,
anyone think that,

1255
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.860
and I did dumb stuff when I was,
uh,

1256
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:26.800
when I was a assistant platoon commander and I did dumb stuff when I was a

1257
01:15:26.801 --> 01:15:29.410
platoon commander and I did dumb stuff when I was a task and a commander and I

1258
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:31.270
did dumb stuff when I was a training commander.
And I do,

1259
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.880
I'm going to do something dumb tomorrow,
watch me.

1260
01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:38.290
But I think I will recognize it.

1261
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.010
Most of the time I look at it and say,
you know what,

1262
01:15:42.011 --> 01:15:45.520
that was dumb and don't do that again.
Or here's how you can avoid it.

1263
01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:47.860
And I think that's what will help people.

1264
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:53.100
If people can can adapt that little skill of stepping back off the off the line

1265
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:58.720
and taking a look around.
Let taking a look at yourself,

1266
01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:02.640
look at how you're being perceived.
What else is important is,

1267
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:07.360
is how to actually think about how echo is perceiving me.

1268
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.220
Right?
Because if I'm in my own head,
I can't,

1269
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.120
I can never see how you're seeing me.
But sometimes if you're acting,
look,

1270
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:16.660
the first thing I do when someone's acting weird to me or I don't understand why

1271
01:16:16.661 --> 01:16:18.910
someone's acting a certain way as I put myself in their shoes,

1272
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.420
it's hard to do that.
And if you don't do that,

1273
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.800
you don't make real,
you can't understand them.

1274
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:31.090
So if my boss is doing something crazy to me and all I do is get pissed at him

1275
01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:33.450
for doing something crazy,
that's what we've just created,

1276
01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:36.370
created an antagonistic relationship and now things are going sideways and it's

1277
01:16:36.371 --> 01:16:39.010
not good.
If my boss is doing something crazy me and I said,
wait a second,

1278
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:42.250
why is he doing this?
Let me think about what he's saying.
Oh,

1279
01:16:42.251 --> 01:16:44.050
he's seeing Jocko,

1280
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:49.080
the caveman looking guy that wants to go out and he seems crazy and okay,

1281
01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:52.960
I need to,
I need to correct that.
I needed to correct that thing.

1282
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:56.320
I need to let him see that I'm thinking about the big picture and that I

1283
01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:57.370
understand this.
Right.
Okay.

1284
01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:02.460
Let me make those adjustments as opposed to real stupid using good screw him.

1285
01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.300
No detach,
check other people's perspectives.

1286
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:10.130
And that's a big key

1287
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.080
<v 3>right there where you were,
like you said,</v>

1288
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.470
the moment you kind of made me realized the importance of this significance of

1289
01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:23.380
detaching,
right?
The oil rig campaign and then campaign.

1290
01:17:23.381 --> 01:17:26.680
It was a training off,
not that big of a deal.
To me that's a campaign,

1291
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:32.260
the and then how you understood at whatever point that that applies to life ism

1292
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.430
because I man,
that's,
I'd say those two things.

1293
01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:44.750
Understanding that you don't know everything and being able to detach with just

1294
01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:49.260
borderline impossible by the way.
Under most circumstances.
Yeah.

1295
01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.020
And as far as applying it to like,

1296
01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.800
like because like even in the military it's like that's a very specific

1297
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:58.940
environment.
Military,
like unlike most environments seeming

1298
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:03.730
like if you come,
you know,
like I was talking about like,
well I don't know,

1299
01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:07.130
go into the post office or going to the grocery store or dealing with my wife or

1300
01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:09.380
something like that.
But like when you go deep enough,

1301
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:14.110
detaching is going to serve the exact same significance.
Good in all situations.

1302
01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.650
You know,
your,
your wife comes home,
you know,
pissed because,

1303
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:23.300
I dunno,
whatever,
you know how you said the first reaction,

1304
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:26.060
what you feel like doing,
which you,
not you,

1305
01:18:26.061 --> 01:18:31.061
but which one may typically do is react accordingly according to how I feel

1306
01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:34.700
about what you're saying to me.
You shouldn't be saying this stuff to me.

1307
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:38.660
I didn't do anything to do.
Why are you doing this to me?
You know,

1308
01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:43.160
they're only dishes or whatever.
Escalate,
escalate,
escalate,
escalate.

1309
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.330
That's what was happening is that,
that's all,
that's not what you're thinking.

1310
01:18:47.331 --> 01:18:51.440
You're just thinking,
Hey,
this isn't fair.
This is wrong what you're doing to me,

1311
01:18:51.441 --> 01:18:53.270
so I'm going to,
you know,
express that or whatever.

1312
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.800
But that's cause you're not detached like you just did.

1313
01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:01.040
And when you're able to do it again,
borderline impossible.

1314
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:05.180
But when you find a borderline impossible,
have you made progress in that arena?

1315
01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:09.620
Hugely.
Here's the,
here's the snow boarder line.
If possible.
That's an expression.

1316
01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:12.400
It's me possible.
It's word landing.

1317
01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:16.400
I say it's borderline impossible because that's the last thing you feel like

1318
01:19:16.401 --> 01:19:18.740
doing.
So if you operate in your life,

1319
01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:21.680
which isn't natural by the way with how you feel,
you know,
like,

1320
01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:25.160
I'm just going to stress on myself.
You know what it's like.
It's like this.

1321
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:29.900
Um,
it,
it's like you're doing something

1322
01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.490
<v 0>and you have to do something completely different.
Yeah,
right.</v>

1323
01:19:33.491 --> 01:19:37.450
Just imagine that you're walking down the road and now all of a sudden you're

1324
01:19:37.451 --> 01:19:40.360
walking down the road.
Maybe you're even jogging,
you're jogging down the road.

1325
01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:42.940
Now all of a sudden in a split second,

1326
01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:46.960
you've got to like go read a book.

1327
01:19:46.961 --> 01:19:50.470
Like right at that moment in time while your running lights like that radical of

1328
01:19:50.471 --> 01:19:52.510
a change.
Like it's something totally,

1329
01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.680
that's what it feels like when you detach from the current situation.

1330
01:19:56.890 --> 01:19:58.390
You're in this,
you're in this thing,

1331
01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.540
you're in this thing and you have to completely go and do something completely

1332
01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:04.750
different.
That's what it feel.
It feels like that radical of a thing when you,

1333
01:20:04.751 --> 01:20:08.040
when you really do it.
And when you do it,
like when you're in a,
you

1334
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.670
<v 1>know,
let's say an argument with someone,
he did a heated argument.
Yeah.</v>

1335
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:16.790
It feels like you're going from running a thousand miles an hour to,

1336
01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:22.440
uh,
to like putting your face in the snow and reciting the alphabet backwards.

1337
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:27.190
That's helpful.
It just totally different.
And so the,
you know,
that's why,

1338
01:20:27.191 --> 01:20:30.290
and people are going to ask any,
they've asked us before,
well how do you detach?

1339
01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:30.901
And then we'll,
the,

1340
01:20:30.901 --> 01:20:33.660
the biggest thing I think you have to do is you have to figure out what your red

1341
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:34.171
flags are.

1342
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:39.171
What are the things that show you that you're too engulfed in the situation and

1343
01:20:39.451 --> 01:20:41.910
then recognize those things and then go put your face in the snow and started

1344
01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.640
reciting the alphabet backwards.
Cause that's what it feels like to detach.

1345
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:48.130
But if you think about the advantage that you have,
and,

1346
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:51.710
and I know you're a football player,
I'm not,
but you know,

1347
01:20:51.711 --> 01:20:55.410
you can watch everybody that's watching the football game on TV can see every

1348
01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:58.940
mistake that's being made as it's happening.
And everyone else on the field is,

1349
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:02.340
they're trying to,
they can't compensate for him fast enough.
They're in the game.

1350
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:05.150
Yeah.
And usually it's on the quarterback,
by the way,
nick,

1351
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:08.610
I was wide open when you go to that.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.

1352
01:21:08.611 --> 01:21:12.090
100% so you have that advantage if you can do that.
Yeah.

1353
01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:16.440
If you can manage to do that in like another cool thing about the situation is

1354
01:21:16.441 --> 01:21:17.820
yet I say borderline impossible,

1355
01:21:17.821 --> 01:21:21.990
but the more you can actually pull through and do it,
the more you can do that,

1356
01:21:21.991 --> 01:21:26.670
the easier it becomes.
And when it becomes like habit,
it really all it is.

1357
01:21:26.671 --> 01:21:28.050
And you can do weird like metal,

1358
01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:32.730
which I'm kind of a fan of doing little metaphors with yourself,
you know?

1359
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:35.280
So if it's like you ever watched those movies?
No.

1360
01:21:37.530 --> 01:21:42.060
Where the movie's going on and then the person that,
what do you call him?

1361
01:21:42.061 --> 01:21:42.894
The protagonist,

1362
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.600
like he pauses the movie and everyone in the movie positive and then he starts

1363
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.990
explaining that is it you?
So it's like you do that to yourself though.

1364
01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:55.710
So yourself as audience.
So you go boom,
wife comes home pissed you didn't,

1365
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.650
I don't know,
clean up the dogs,
whatever or I dunno,
whatever.

1366
01:21:58.651 --> 01:22:01.190
You didn't move along.
How about that?
She's pissed,
right?

1367
01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:05.940
You can easily move along tonight.
You can easily mold on tomorrow whenever.

1368
01:22:05.941 --> 01:22:07.560
Right.
But she's pissed,
right?
You don't think so.

1369
01:22:07.561 --> 01:22:11.100
So what you do is right when you feel yourself or right when you get her yelling

1370
01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:14.430
at you,
boom,
pause the movie.
What do we have here?
What do we have here?

1371
01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:18.930
We have myself,
we have life.
She's mad at something.

1372
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:21.750
Doesn't make sense.
What would make,
you know?

1373
01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:25.150
It's like then you just detach at that point if you can't make sense.
Yeah.

1374
01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:28.860
How are we going to solve the problem?
Like,

1375
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:31.230
you know how you said like the football game,
when you,

1376
01:22:31.231 --> 01:22:33.630
if you can pause the movie at that,
at that point,

1377
01:22:33.631 --> 01:22:37.560
step back you will easily make sense of because you'll be like,
oh,
guess what?

1378
01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.240
My wife,
I haven't been home for four days.
Yeah.

1379
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:44.110
I left a bunch of laundry out.
Yeah,

1380
01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.930
the baby was diaper was dirty and I forgot to throw it away.
Um,
um,
okay.

1381
01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.550
I see where she's not mad about the law and specifically as opposed to things I

1382
01:22:51.551 --> 01:22:55.740
did wrong.
And so you say,
Hey,
you know what?
I totally should have mowed the lawn.

1383
01:22:55.741 --> 01:23:00.360
And by the way,
the diapers,
that was,
that was completely out of hand.

1384
01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:03.480
You know what I mean?
And,
and you diffuse and you deescalate the situation.

1385
01:23:03.481 --> 01:23:05.870
You're detached and that's how you,
that's how you roll.
Yeah.
That's how you

1386
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.590
<v 3>make it through it.
And here's a little side tip</v>

1387
01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.633
<v 2>on</v>

1388
01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.890
<v 3>that situation.
Alon.
The diapers or whatever.</v>

1389
01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:19.730
It's not that that the grass is long and she wants it short and the fact that

1390
01:23:19.741 --> 01:23:23.430
it's long is making her mat,
that's not the situation.
The situation is.

1391
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.630
She said something.

1392
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:27.990
She thought that that meant something that she said something she thought it

1393
01:23:27.991 --> 01:23:31.830
meant something to you when it came time to prove whether or not that meant

1394
01:23:31.831 --> 01:23:36.140
something to you,
you've proved it,
did it.
That's what you're dealing with.

1395
01:23:36.141 --> 01:23:38.970
That's what you guys are dealing with and that's easy to figure out when you

1396
01:23:38.971 --> 01:23:41.020
detach.
It's hard to what I figured out.
Yeah.

1397
01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:44.030
When you're in the heat of the moment,
when you're in the game,

1398
01:23:44.050 --> 01:23:47.670
it's hard to see who's open and who's not.
Some of the time,
most of the time.

1399
01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:51.390
Pretty sure all of the time in my case.
All right,
next one.

1400
01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.960
Next question.
I think this question is a good,
good lead.

1401
01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:58.200
That last answer was a good lead into this next question.
Yeah.

1402
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.320
How do you think,

1403
01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:02.450
<v 2>okay</v>

1404
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:05.180
<v 3>young Jocko would've performed under commander</v>

1405
01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:10.080
<v 0>willing,
all young joc on their old job.
They see that reaction that you just had?</v>

1406
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:15.090
Yeah.
It is what I expected because it seems like it should be like a really

1407
01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.730
interesting question with like a really interesting answer,

1408
01:24:17.731 --> 01:24:20.250
but it actually isn't that interesting to me to be quite honest with you.

1409
01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:24.750
If Young Jocko was working for old Jocko,
it would have been good to go.

1410
01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:30.560
I would have liked me as a young guy and as a young guy would have liked me as a

1411
01:24:31.411 --> 01:24:33.120
boss.
I was a young,

1412
01:24:33.121 --> 01:24:37.140
hard worker with a good attitude and sometimes it got a little bit wild as I,

1413
01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:38.790
as I mentioned a little bit earlier.

1414
01:24:38.970 --> 01:24:41.970
But I could have been tightened up by the right leader.
And I wasn't like,

1415
01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:43.643
<v 2>okay,</v>

1416
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:48.020
<v 0>I wasn't,
I wasn't,
um,</v>

1417
01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:52.770
it wasn't ever interfering with work and all your wild shit.

1418
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.700
Wild.
My wildness,
you know,
we're getting wild.
We were young,

1419
01:24:55.850 --> 01:25:00.850
young guys with a fist full of money and young guys and the bear this and we're

1420
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:05.780
just getting after it and you know,
the guys.
But,

1421
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:08.930
but we weren't like causing major trouble.
Right.

1422
01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:13.280
We weren't getting arrested much.
Yeah.
We weren't getting in fights all the time.

1423
01:25:13.281 --> 01:25:16.370
You know,
we were causing some problems,
but it wasn't nothing major.

1424
01:25:16.371 --> 01:25:18.920
So we do been tighten up and we got tightened up sometimes,

1425
01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:24.290
but it would have been no factor.
And
as a young guy,

1426
01:25:24.570 --> 01:25:25.403
<v 2>mmm.</v>

1427
01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:28.020
<v 0>You know,
I,
I think I would've,</v>

1428
01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:31.090
I would've liked working for me because I would have looked at myself and didn't

1429
01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.080
like,
oh that guys fired up.
You want to get after it?

1430
01:25:33.081 --> 01:25:36.460
And then that would have been cool with me.
So,
so again,
I don't think it's,

1431
01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:40.780
I don't think it's like,
uh,
uh,
it sounds like a really interesting question,

1432
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:42.460
but it's not really that interesting.

1433
01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:46.090
And the cool thing is there's a lot of young team guys that are like,

1434
01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:49.540
I was when I was young team guy.
Yeah.
It's,
so I was like,

1435
01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:52.840
I was looked at old young team guys like,
Oh yeah,
I remembered.
I was like that.

1436
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:55.780
Good for him.
Hey,
good for him.
He's fired up.

1437
01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:00.480
<v 3>Would there be any issues though?
You know,
like as young Jocko,</v>

1438
01:26:00.481 --> 01:26:03.980
who do you think,
or not who,
but what you think would be your

1439
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.640
<v 1>major struggle,
you know,
any,
even</v>

1440
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:13.910
with my,
with the boss.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nah,
no,

1441
01:26:13.911 --> 01:26:18.830
we would have been cool.
We've been cool.
Yeah.
And the fact of matter is,

1442
01:26:18.831 --> 01:26:23.831
I mean like 95% of the young buck team guys that worked for me.

1443
01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:30.380
I love those guys.
They were awesome and no issues.
Yeah.
So you're,
you were like,

1444
01:26:30.381 --> 01:26:34.340
you essentially on the path then really,
you know,
with some loose ends.
For sure.

1445
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:39.230
For sure.
Yeah.
It was on the path.
And you know,
my,
my,

1446
01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:43.290
the guys that I got went to buds with that showed up and she'll team one

1447
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.290
old Jocko would have loved all those guys.
Yeah.
They were all fired up.

1448
01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:49.700
I was nothing special.
I don't know.

1449
01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:51.320
I'm not trying to say I was special because I wasn't,

1450
01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:54.140
there was guys that were way better than me.
And you know,
that's,

1451
01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:57.560
to go back to your question earlier when I described myself like as my good

1452
01:26:57.561 --> 01:26:58.700
quality being durable,

1453
01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:02.300
the reason I say that is cause like there's guys that were better at me than

1454
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:06.080
that just about everything like faster than me,
stronger than me,

1455
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:10.820
better shots than me,
whatever.
I was pretty durable though.
Like I was pretty,

1456
01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.980
I was good at being average and a lot of different things.

1457
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.380
So I was a strong average and a lot of different things,

1458
01:27:15.381 --> 01:27:17.390
which is good and I was durable like I could,

1459
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:21.010
I could take some abuse and mental and physical abuse,
which is,

1460
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:24.580
which is a cool quality to have,
you know?
Very much so.

1461
01:27:24.581 --> 01:27:27.650
You're like a tank that just can't,
yeah,
and again,
I'm not trying to,

1462
01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.660
I'm no superman,
but I'm durable.
You know that that makes sense.
You know the,

1463
01:27:32.661 --> 01:27:36.140
you know like the,
the Toyota High Lux,
you know Toyota,

1464
01:27:36.141 --> 01:27:40.190
I'll have Alexis who is,
it's a,
it's a Toyota truck.

1465
01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:44.390
They have him overseas,
their diesel and they're really,

1466
01:27:44.391 --> 01:27:49.040
really durable.
Really?
There's a,
there's a show from England,

1467
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:52.400
my wife's from England.
There's a show in England.
It's called top gear.

1468
01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.260
My son watches the show top gear.

1469
01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.650
They tried to destroy it to a Toyota High Lux.

1470
01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:02.150
They were doing just crazy things to it.
It's a really durable,

1471
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:06.410
it's not the fastest,
it's not the strongest,
but it's durable.

1472
01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:10.100
Durable is a good quality to have just continued.
I got asked the other day,

1473
01:28:10.101 --> 01:28:13.220
you sweats.
Okay,
you should do Olympic lifting.
I went,
Bro,

1474
01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:17.090
I'm not even in the Ballpark,
you know,
compete with Olympic,

1475
01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.910
just crazy talk.
Crazy Deb.
I'm sorry.
That's anything.
Then you start competing.

1476
01:28:22.911 --> 01:28:26.930
You better.
Yeah.
Crazy talk check.

1477
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.710
So yeah,
young,
young,
young buck Jocko,

1478
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:34.430
he would had a good time and old Jocko.
Like I say,
man,
there's,

1479
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:37.670
there's a ton of young team guys fired up.
I was,

1480
01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:40.370
I was out with some young teen,

1481
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:44.570
I was out with some team guys and there were some young young team guys there

1482
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:49.610
and some of these young guys are
awesome and like,

1483
01:28:49.611 --> 01:28:53.620
yeah,
you know what?
You know people say like,
oh,
millennials and the SNLP,
oh,

1484
01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.720
America's getting weak.
I'm like,
I'm gonna go hang out with some of those guys.

1485
01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:00.830
They're 20 years old.
I'm like,
you know what?
We're going to go,
we're good to go.

1486
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:05.320
We got snow guys that are beasts solid.
Yeah.

1487
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:09.390
Beyond solid freaking awesome.
Yeah.
My,

1488
01:29:09.490 --> 01:29:13.710
my two friends that are in the d Jeremy cake nuts.
Think talking to them now,

1489
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:18.740
like the maturity level is just really like really impressive maturity levels,

1490
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:20.340
especially for both of them.

1491
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:24.660
But at the same time thinking back on them and how they kind of,

1492
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:27.270
when they started,
when they were like,
yeah,
we're going in the seal teams,

1493
01:29:27.271 --> 01:29:30.870
all this stuff.
Considering that and then considering where they are now,

1494
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:31.351
it makes,

1495
01:29:31.351 --> 01:29:36.351
it seems the same to me where the older them wouldn't have a problem really with

1496
01:29:36.841 --> 01:29:40.020
no longer then it's like they were on the path.
Oh sure.
Path for sure.

1497
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.850
Those kind of guys I'm talking about like those guys,

1498
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:44.160
I would love to have those guys working for me when I was,

1499
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:48.270
when I was a commander and I would love to have those guys as my chief when I

1500
01:29:48.271 --> 01:29:52.710
was a young guy.
Yeah,
no,
no factor.
Yeah.
So like I said,

1501
01:29:52.711 --> 01:29:56.590
I think people thought that sounded like an interesting question.
But yeah,

1502
01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.260
unfortunately like you're in a meeting.
All these

1503
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:05.400
crazy was some crazy stuff.
What about socially though?
No,
not socially,

1504
01:30:05.401 --> 01:30:09.440
but what did he say?
Like in like outside of the military,
you know,
chat all,

1505
01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:13.770
I mean I was a young kid and as an older guy you look at the young kids and you

1506
01:30:13.771 --> 01:30:17.250
go,
yeah,
you know he's young,
he's getting after it.
God bless him.

1507
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:20.370
Let's rock and roll.
I got to let me keep them out of trouble.
Yeah,

1508
01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:25.470
that's all good.
All good.
I think I might have some problems with myself.

1509
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:31.260
Young Echo.
Oh cause younger echo wasn't on the path yet.
No,
I don't know.

1510
01:30:31.261 --> 01:30:36.130
Yeah,
there was no path.
I didn't even see a path really.
I Dunno.

1511
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:38.970
Maybe
next question.

1512
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:45.330
What advice would Jocko give his 17 year old self regarding school,

1513
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:50.310
social relationships,
parents,
peer pressure,
et Cetera.

1514
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:53.250
Yes,
exactly.
The actual Jocko podcast tonight is like,

1515
01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:56.370
all these questions are about Daca actually.
That's kind of what I was asking.

1516
01:30:56.371 --> 01:31:00.170
Like outside of the military,
you know,
if I was going to tell myself something,

1517
01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:03.110
here's a couple of things,
you know,
I would tell myself to detach.
I tell him,

1518
01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.350
tell him myself to learn that.

1519
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:10.310
I would tell myself that that girl isn't the whole world and those friends

1520
01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:14.310
aren't the last friends are ever going to have and the party isn't going to be

1521
01:31:14.311 --> 01:31:17.820
the best party of all time and all those things that you've think it,

1522
01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:18.870
this is what we talked about earlier.

1523
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:21.630
All of those things that you think are a huge deal when you're young,

1524
01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:26.430
they're not a big deal.
And I know that's Kinda messed up,
but it's true,
man.

1525
01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:30.270
It's true.
The things that you think are a big deal when you're 17 years old,

1526
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:31.860
I'm not that big of a deal.

1527
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.650
And it's really hard to convince someone that's 17 years old yeah.
Of that,

1528
01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:40.290
right?
Oh yeah.
They also also,

1529
01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:45.030
what they don't recognize is things that are a big deal.
They don't recognize.

1530
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:48.950
They think they're a little deal.
So they,
they're doing stupid things,
right?
Yeah.

1531
01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:51.810
Whether it's drinking and driving weather,

1532
01:31:51.811 --> 01:31:56.220
I mean kids still drink and drive now.
Like how dumb is,
that?

1533
01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:59.860
Seems crazy.
And just so people don't think,
you know,

1534
01:31:59.861 --> 01:32:01.900
nowadays we've talked about social media or a two,

1535
01:32:01.901 --> 01:32:06.280
but people post stuff on social media and you cool man,
what is wrong with you?

1536
01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:08.920
And I guess,
you know,
I've heard now,
you know,

1537
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:11.650
we work with a lot of different companies.
When you apply for a job,

1538
01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:15.640
they go and look at your social media and see what kind of an idiot you might
be.

1539
01:32:15.641 --> 01:32:20.410
Yeah,
that's a good move.
But no,
it's a great move.
It's a great move.
So,
um,

1540
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:21.550
yeah,
just,

1541
01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:25.720
just recognize that some of the little things are actually big and some of the

1542
01:32:25.721 --> 01:32:29.810
big things are actually a little,
and I'd square those things away.
And the,

1543
01:32:29.811 --> 01:32:31.780
I've said this before,
when you're young,

1544
01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:36.930
you've got to realize that how you act now is directly related to your future

1545
01:32:37.421 --> 01:32:41.440
success,
to your future happiness,
to your future financial situation,

1546
01:32:41.441 --> 01:32:46.180
to everything.
So,
so it's hard to make that connection,
right?
We were young,

1547
01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.040
might be impossible.
Some kids get it though.
I'm telling you,
some kids get it.

1548
01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:56.020
I think they're just,
no,
some kids get it.
Some of my oldest daughter's friends,

1549
01:32:56.050 --> 01:33:00.250
they get it,
like they're on track,
they're on track,

1550
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:04.300
they're there.
They're like,
Hey,
I'm doing this.
I'm doing that.
They're on track.

1551
01:33:04.301 --> 01:33:07.240
They're 16 years old.
They're studying for the sats,

1552
01:33:07.241 --> 01:33:10.360
they're taking the AP classes.
My daughter included,

1553
01:33:10.361 --> 01:33:13.400
like they're on track to make stuff happen.
Yeah.

1554
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:17.140
But I think,
and I'm not thinking this is the case,

1555
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:22.000
but this is probably the case one way or another.
That could be wrong.

1556
01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:25.760
I understand.
But okay,
so we talked about this before.
You know,

1557
01:33:25.761 --> 01:33:28.270
that part of your brain that understands all that that you're talking about

1558
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:31.180
isn't either developed or developed.
So this is,
uh,
you know,

1559
01:33:31.181 --> 01:33:34.780
and this is from what I understand how you kind of influence people.

1560
01:33:34.781 --> 01:33:37.270
You just put them on a routine,
kind of like,
okay.

1561
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:41.160
So it's the difference between understanding like what I'm doing now and having

1562
01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:45.660
a tangible no,
until I know where you're going with us and your,

1563
01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:49.000
I believe that there are definitely some kids like that that are just,

1564
01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:49.840
they're just like,
hey,
okay,

1565
01:33:49.841 --> 01:33:51.980
I'm supposed to get good grades and maybe he could grants I'm supposed to get,

1566
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.600
they get on that track.
I know for a fact kids that are like,
no,

1567
01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.470
I am going to do this,
this,
this and it's going to lead me here.
Actually,

1568
01:33:59.471 --> 01:34:01.720
you know what,
you're right cause this is good.
Blake,
you know,

1569
01:34:01.721 --> 01:34:04.770
remember Blake and he used to do videos for yeah,
so he,

1570
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:08.280
we did like a thing where it was,
I think he was like a Q and a or something,

1571
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:09.640
something like that.
And he was,

1572
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:12.790
he was talking about that were in elementary school.

1573
01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:17.791
He remembers feeling like if I don't have perfect attendance and have perfect

1574
01:34:19.661 --> 01:34:22.770
straight A's,
I won't pass this.
Not passed,

1575
01:34:22.771 --> 01:34:27.540
but I won't like be the perfect guy or whatever.
And he said that he would,
um,

1576
01:34:27.650 --> 01:34:31.630
it would like create like this track to his whole future in his life would be

1577
01:34:31.631 --> 01:34:34.590
ruined.
That's how he felt.
He goes like,
Whoa,
no,

1578
01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:38.680
I'm living like literally minute to minute and third grade.

1579
01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:42.880
It'd be like,
the reason I wanted to do my homework and get good grades,

1580
01:34:42.930 --> 01:34:44.740
it's so I wouldn't get in trouble straight,
straight.

1581
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.370
It was not to get into college,
none of that stuff for sure.

1582
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:53.260
And then eat some way.
Most kids are,
in my opinion,
most kids are,
hey,

1583
01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:57.320
I don't want to get in trouble.
Some immediate repercussions,
myself included,
hey,

1584
01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:01.630
I got a pass this so I can go to the next grade.
You know what I mean?

1585
01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:04.730
Stuff or I don't want to be the guy in class who didn't do his homework,

1586
01:35:04.731 --> 01:35:05.564
you know,
kind of thing.

1587
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:13.310
But yeah,
I guess so.
Yeah,
I guess so that's,
that's me trying to,

1588
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:17.450
I got to step outside of myself on that one.
And I guess the final thing,

1589
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.430
obviously I'd tell myself discipline equals freedom,

1590
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.160
which is basically what we're saying.
Yeah.

1591
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:24.770
So get disciplined in how you live your life.

1592
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:31.070
And that I think the biggest one there is two to whether they totally understand

1593
01:35:31.701 --> 01:35:34.340
it or not.
Say like what you're doing right,

1594
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.120
right now is the important things in life.

1595
01:35:38.121 --> 01:35:40.760
The things that you think are important or not are not important.

1596
01:35:40.761 --> 01:35:44.390
And then things that aren't that you think are not in [inaudible] are important.

1597
01:35:44.391 --> 01:35:47.170
So it's kind of like a,
like an iceberg,
you know,
I'll be old PR,

1598
01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.670
you know the people that are more not to over that little statement.

1599
01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:52.130
You don't why?
Because people really like the way you say important.

1600
01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:55.250
You just said it eight times.
So yeah.

1601
01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:59.570
Well Flurry of glory and rainbows.
Emojis.

1602
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.770
All right,
well hey,
I agree with you.
So like the iceberg thing,
you know,

1603
01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:06.200
you know the iceberg metaphor where it's like people only see the top of the

1604
01:36:06.201 --> 01:36:09.560
iceberg,
but below that is like this huge iceberg.
So that's what,

1605
01:36:09.561 --> 01:36:12.110
that's what important things are in life,
right?

1606
01:36:12.111 --> 01:36:14.450
So you think it's just this little small little iceberg.

1607
01:36:14.451 --> 01:36:17.660
But when you think of the whole scope of life,
which you have no access to,

1608
01:36:17.661 --> 01:36:21.410
by the way,
as a kid,
it's that whole iceberg,
you know?

1609
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:25.310
So if you're not focusing on that important part of the iceberg,

1610
01:36:25.311 --> 01:36:29.240
well I guess an iceberg situation,
it's not that important,
but another metaphor.

1611
01:36:29.241 --> 01:36:34.040
But it will sink your ship.
Yeah.
You know,
like in that kind of situation.
Um,
but,

1612
01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:37.220
and then at the same time,
the things that aren't really important,

1613
01:36:37.221 --> 01:36:39.170
meaning they don't have an iceberg under there.

1614
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.780
They're just a little floaty thing.
You think that's so important.

1615
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:44.870
Nothing's going to melt or get cra or whatever,
you know,
not going to send,

1616
01:36:44.871 --> 01:36:47.330
you know,
it's not going to think you're just going to kind of,

1617
01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:50.000
it's a fleeting check.

1618
01:36:50.050 --> 01:36:54.980
A one thing before we closed out tonight cause I think that's good for

1619
01:36:54.981 --> 01:36:58.430
questions.
I wanted to hit a couple of quick Tim Ferriss' new book.

1620
01:36:58.431 --> 01:37:00.770
I want to hit a couple quick things from it.

1621
01:37:01.570 --> 01:37:05.210
Tribe of mentors is what it's called and um,

1622
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:09.860
a lot of good info in it.
And it's written in really short little sections.

1623
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:12.650
If he didn't know the shit,
I mean you can read him in like five or 10 minutes.

1624
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:16.970
And what he did in this book as you took and asked the same,

1625
01:37:16.971 --> 01:37:21.230
I think it's 10 or 11 questions to all these different,

1626
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:24.530
I would say random,
but they're not random because they're all kind of

1627
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:30.650
successful in whatever realm they're going to be successful in.

1628
01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:35.420
Cause I guess successful is a very open term,

1629
01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:38.280
right?
Whatever realm they're in,
they're successful.

1630
01:37:38.281 --> 01:37:40.220
There's all kinds of people in here and I just,

1631
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:45.290
I read like the first couple of 150 pages or so and I just wanted to do pull out

1632
01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:47.000
a couple of the

1633
01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:52.370
couple of ones that I thought were pretty cool that I thought people could take

1634
01:37:52.371 --> 01:37:54.710
a little something away from.
And I was like,
Tim,

1635
01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:55.850
can I read couple of these things?

1636
01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:59.870
<v 0>He's like,
yeah,
go ahead.
Whatever.</v>

1637
01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.380
Hopefully it doesn't sue me.
Uh,
anyways,

1638
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:06.540
so here we go.

1639
01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:11.541
The first one is a little section from some excerpts and I'm not reading the

1640
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:15.570
whole like everything in each person's section,

1641
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.510
but just some of the highlights.
Steven Pressfield.

1642
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:20.120
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1643
01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:21.620
<v 0>The guy.
He's an author,
he's in the Marine Corps.</v>

1644
01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:25.400
You know who Steven Pressfield is?
Sorry,
Dude.
Yeah.
He wrote the art of war.

1645
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:29.690
He wrote the legend of Bagger Vance.
That's a movie war of art.
Yeah.
Sorry.

1646
01:38:29.691 --> 01:38:33.320
He wrote the war of art.
Yeah.
Which is obviously a play on words for,

1647
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:38.350
for the art of war and the war of art is like how to be creative and how to

1648
01:38:38.511 --> 01:38:41.260
overcome those things to overcome the resistance and all that.
Yes,
yes.

1649
01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:44.960
Through Joe Rogan actually told me he used to have a stack of those books and

1650
01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:48.290
you just give them to people that came to,
uh,
meet him.
Yeah.
That's why I read it.

1651
01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:53.300
Joe Rogan.
Oh,
there you go.
And he also wrote gates of fire,

1652
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:56.900
which is a freaking awesome book actually.

1653
01:38:57.050 --> 01:39:02.050
And it's about the Spartans at the battle of Thermopylae and they actually teach

1654
01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:05.060
the gates of fire,

1655
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:09.920
like at the basic school for the Marine Corps and at the Naval Academy at least

1656
01:39:09.921 --> 01:39:13.430
I've heard that they've teach it.
So that's pretty,
that's pretty awesome.
Anyways,

1657
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:15.420
<v 4>okay.</v>

1658
01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:19.110
<v 0>Here's a question for Steven Pressfield.
The question is,</v>

1659
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:23.160
what advice would you give to a smart driven college student about to enter the

1660
01:39:23.161 --> 01:39:26.700
real world?
What advice should they ignore?
Here's what he said.

1661
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:29.460
I'm probably hopelessly out of date,

1662
01:39:29.461 --> 01:39:33.450
but my advice is get real world experience.
Be a cowboy,

1663
01:39:33.810 --> 01:39:36.330
drive a truck,
join the Marine Corps,

1664
01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:40.470
get out of the hyper competitive life hack frame of mind.

1665
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.770
I'm 74 believe me,
you've got all the time in the world.

1666
01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:45.570
You've got 10 lifetimes ahead of you.

1667
01:39:45.690 --> 01:39:49.260
Don't worry about your friends beating you or getting somewhere ahead of you.

1668
01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:54.540
Get out and get into the real dirt world and start failing.

1669
01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:59.040
Why do I say that?
Because the goal is to connect with your own self,

1670
01:39:59.041 --> 01:40:01.770
your own soul adversity.

1671
01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:06.630
Everybody spends their life trying to avoid it.
Me Too,

1672
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:11.790
but the best things that ever happened to me came during the times when the shit

1673
01:40:11.791 --> 01:40:14.760
hit the fan and I had nothing and nobody to help me.

1674
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.860
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1675
01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:19.040
<v 0>who are you really?
What do you really want?</v>

1676
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.790
Get out there and fail and find out.

1677
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:28.190
Very interesting.
Pretty,
what's funny,
I was talking to jade last night,

1678
01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:33.100
literally last night and he told me the same thing.
Get out there and fail.
What?

1679
01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:37.310
What part?
That,
whoa.
That thing.
It's like,
you know live.

1680
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:40.160
So me,
when I step outside of my comfort zone,

1681
01:40:40.161 --> 01:40:45.050
I take one tiny step and here's the thing told you to jump.
He told me the,
yeah,

1682
01:40:45.051 --> 01:40:48.380
like take a bigger jump kind of thing.
He didn't tell me to do it.

1683
01:40:48.381 --> 01:40:51.500
He just recommended it because,
well,
you know,
my whole,

1684
01:40:51.501 --> 01:40:54.010
and this is probably half by the

1685
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.930
<v 3>way,
I have a comfort zone.</v>

1686
01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:01.020
I'll take one tiny step and then I'll take the,
you know,
when you suppose I,

1687
01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.520
you get burned or whatever you get,
you know the whatever,

1688
01:41:03.521 --> 01:41:07.060
and then you grow from it.
That's what happens.
That's the whole idea.
Right?

1689
01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:11.260
So I take a tiny step that I take the tiny hit and then I get the tiny growth.

1690
01:41:11.261 --> 01:41:14.530
But I tried to do it all the time.
All the time.
All the time.
But it's still safe,

1691
01:41:14.531 --> 01:41:14.920
man.

1692
01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:18.310
That's still safe because that's just like one pinky outside the comfort zone.

1693
01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:21.520
That's what he was saying.
He was like,
you like,

1694
01:41:21.521 --> 01:41:25.990
you gotta step outside because just the fact that you can endure a big fail,

1695
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.520
you know,
he didn't go out there and fail,
right.
It's field.

1696
01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.800
So if you can endure like a big fail are too big fails or major fails,

1697
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:37.270
now you have the ability to endure major failure.
You know,

1698
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:41.320
that kind of thing.
That was his whole thing.
I was like,
yeah,
that makes sense.

1699
01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:44.500
I didn't tell him that at the time.
Oh Man,
I'm doing it perfectly.

1700
01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:50.650
Truck.
Uh,
next question for Steven Pressfield.

1701
01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:54.880
When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused,
what do you do?

1702
01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:01.980
<v 0>Here's his answer.
I have a friend at the gym who knew Jack Lalaine.
Google him.</v>

1703
01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:03.540
If the name is unfamiliar,

1704
01:42:03.541 --> 01:42:07.800
Jack used to say it's okay to take a day off from working out,

1705
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:10.920
but on that day,
you're not allowed to eat.

1706
01:42:13.230 --> 01:42:17.760
That's the short way of saying you're not really allowed to get unfocused.

1707
01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.580
Take a vacation,
gather yourself,

1708
01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:24.900
but know that the only reason you're here on this planet is to follow your star

1709
01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:25.431
and do it.

1710
01:42:25.431 --> 01:42:30.431
The Muse tells you it's amazing how a good days work will get you right back to

1711
01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:34.650
feeling like yourself.
That's good info right there.
Hmm.

1712
01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:39.730
When I realized this,
um,

1713
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:41.500
<v 4>okay,</v>

1714
01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:46.500
<v 0>it's so easy to go down the downward spiral of eat bad food.</v>

1715
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:52.600
Feel bad,
not get good workouts,
sleep late,
sleep like crap.

1716
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:53.683
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1717
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:56.980
<v 0>And,
and then what do you do when you feel like crap?</v>

1718
01:42:58.770 --> 01:43:02.940
<v 3>You want to feel better as soon as possible.</v>

1719
01:43:02.941 --> 01:43:05.160
So you do some immediate gratification,

1720
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:07.530
<v 0>right?
You,
you go,
Oh,
you know what?</v>

1721
01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.110
I don't feel like working out so I'm not going to work out.
Yeah.

1722
01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:13.110
And then you say,
you know what?
I don't feel good.

1723
01:43:13.210 --> 01:43:15.750
And the reason you don't feel good,
it's because you didn't work out.
That's a,

1724
01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.600
now what you do is you like,
well,
you know what's going to make me feel better?

1725
01:43:18.630 --> 01:43:20.910
A donut got a beer in a beer.

1726
01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:25.740
And so you get the donut and the beer and then now you really don't feel like

1727
01:43:25.741 --> 01:43:30.630
working out.
So that's the downward spiral.
Yeah.
Break the spiral.
Break it.

1728
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.411
Break.

1729
01:43:31.411 --> 01:43:34.800
What'd you call him at the other day when Jordan Peterson was on break the loop.

1730
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:36.480
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
So it's the same thing.

1731
01:43:36.481 --> 01:43:38.100
You got to break the loop and that's what he's talking about.

1732
01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:41.160
When you're feeling like crap,
get after it.

1733
01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:43.950
That's how I translate it.

1734
01:43:44.370 --> 01:43:48.450
And it makes you feel better and it gets you right back on the path.
Yeah.

1735
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:51.330
And that's why actually fasting is a good thing.
Yeah.

1736
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:53.690
Fasting is a good way to get yourself read.

1737
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:59.060
Reacquainted with the path real quick.
You fill your body with a bunch of junk.

1738
01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:03.230
Yeah.
It makes you not want to perform.
It makes you not want to work out.

1739
01:44:03.231 --> 01:44:08.000
It makes you not want to work.
When you're clean,
you feel good.

1740
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:10.310
So hit a fast 24 hours,

1741
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:16.400
you know rock and roll.
Yeah.
And I liked that.
You want to take a day off?

1742
01:44:16.401 --> 01:44:21.140
That's cool.
No evening.
How legit is that?
It's a real legit,

1743
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:26.030
it's a real legit cause now.
Yes.
What?
At lunchtime you're like,
man,

1744
01:44:26.031 --> 01:44:29.750
I just want to eat something cool.
Go Bank and then you can get your grub on

1745
01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.170
or you can just work out and still muddy.

1746
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:40.640
All right,
getting into the next cat here.

1747
01:44:41.630 --> 01:44:46.630
This guy's name is Jersey Gregorich and this guy emigrated from Poland,

1748
01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:52.481
the United States as a political refugee with his wife in 1986 and he won,

1749
01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.190
subsequently won four world weightlifting championships and established one

1750
01:44:59.191 --> 01:45:03.440
world record record,
founded the Ucla weight lifting team.

1751
01:45:03.441 --> 01:45:05.990
And by the way,
this guy has been on,

1752
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:10.160
this guy's been on Tim's podcast as well.
This Guy Jersey,

1753
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:15.530
also writer write poem,
wrote poems and had a ward winning poems.

1754
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:19.870
But this is kind of a cool little statement that he wrote in here.
Uh,

1755
01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.750
he kind of goes on a little bit of a tangent,

1756
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:26.990
but this isn't related to the question,
but I'm going to jump into it.
He says,

1757
01:45:26.991 --> 01:45:31.250
five years ago I decided to eliminate my reactive behavior to irritations,

1758
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:34.100
but at first,
none of my tricks worked.

1759
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:38.840
I placed philosophical and inspirational quotes on my iPhone wallpaper and wrote

1760
01:45:38.841 --> 01:45:42.500
in my journal,
but the proverbs always lost it effectiveness over time.

1761
01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:48.220
Then one day I told one of my clients who blamed her husband for everything to

1762
01:45:48.501 --> 01:45:53.501
take 100% responsibility for her part in the interactions this way.

1763
01:45:54.621 --> 01:45:58.940
I said,
you will be free of trying to control him and you will be able to find

1764
01:45:58.941 --> 01:46:03.140
constructive solutions in your relationship.
When she left,

1765
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:05.810
I realized that the same advice could help me as well.

1766
01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:10.900
Taking 100% personal responsibility would help me to stop blaming or complaining

1767
01:46:11.151 --> 01:46:12.830
and achieve a sense of flow.

1768
01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:16.820
It would also give me the clarity in any conversation to locate the right words

1769
01:46:16.821 --> 01:46:18.680
to help a person except a hard choice.

1770
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:23.210
So he's talking about extreme ownership and,
and we talk about that.

1771
01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.640
We're in,
take it out,

1772
01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.370
take an extreme ownership in a relationship with another human being.

1773
01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:31.310
Don't blame them.
Figured out how you're going to solve the problem yourself.

1774
01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:34.550
You know what this reminded me of was when captain plump was on and he was,

1775
01:46:34.551 --> 01:46:37.690
had his cell mate and what they do,

1776
01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:40.130
you remember Captain Plumb and we touched on it,

1777
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:44.870
but he was saying that if their cellmate was annoying them,

1778
01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:46.070
because believe you know,
they're,

1779
01:46:46.071 --> 01:46:50.160
they're living with one other or two other or three other people for months on

1780
01:46:50.161 --> 01:46:53.730
end in a little freaking Hanoi Hilton cell.

1781
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:56.430
And he said,
if that person,

1782
01:46:56.431 --> 01:47:00.450
because you can imagine how you get on each other's nerves and they all took the

1783
01:47:00.451 --> 01:47:04.890
APP to date if they allowed themselves.
If,
if echo is getting on my nerves,

1784
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:08.790
it wasn't [inaudible] fault.
It was my fault.
Yeah,
yeah.
Mindful.
Yeah.

1785
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:12.390
And that's what he's talking about here.
Then you can actually fix it.

1786
01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:13.593
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1787
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:18.690
<v 0>That the next question that Jersey answered is this one.</v>

1788
01:47:18.691 --> 01:47:21.390
If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it,

1789
01:47:21.391 --> 01:47:25.980
what would it say and why?
And here we go.
Here's what his answer was.

1790
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:29.760
Hard choices,
easy life,
easy choices,
hard life,

1791
01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.380
nothing truly meaningful or lasting has ever been created in a short period of

1792
01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:39.090
time.
If you learn the story behind any great success,

1793
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.290
you realize how many years went by and how many hard choices were made to

1794
01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:47.280
achieve it.
Reaching for more is not only an act of ambition,

1795
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:50.730
it also be comes.
It also comes from passion and love.

1796
01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.090
Nothing is achieved because of easy choices.

1797
01:47:55.050 --> 01:47:59.940
I believe that people can endure any hardship if it is sensible and
constructive.

1798
01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:05.430
Hard choices means never retiring because the brain has to be engaged and

1799
01:48:05.431 --> 01:48:09.750
finding new solutions in the moment,
not just remembering old formulas.

1800
01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.400
Hard choices make us wiser,
smarter,

1801
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:18.390
stronger and wealthier and easy choices.

1802
01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.700
Reverse our progress,

1803
01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:26.300
focusing our energies on a comfort or entertainment in every difficult moment.

1804
01:48:28.650 --> 01:48:29.610
Ask Yourself,

1805
01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:34.830
what is a hard choice and what is an easy choice and you will know instantly

1806
01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.060
what is right.

1807
01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:44.130
That's good.
What does that even need?
Commentary,
not really

1808
01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:49.590
make sense.
That's a great thing to think about.
Yeah,

1809
01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:53.910
it's a discipline equals freedom.
Yes.
Is Hard,
man.
Yeah.

1810
01:48:53.911 --> 01:48:57.130
You know how he said like pay now or pay later kind of thing.

1811
01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:01.380
You know if you want to pay later or if you want.

1812
01:49:01.381 --> 01:49:04.100
A lot of people they try to pay later.
You know,

1813
01:49:05.530 --> 01:49:06.630
I heard one the other day.

1814
01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:10.090
You can either suffer the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.
Right?

1815
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.400
Same thing.
Same thing.
Same exact thing.

1816
01:49:11.490 --> 01:49:15.810
People saying the same thing must mean something.
It must mean something.

1817
01:49:15.811 --> 01:49:20.550
Pay attention to it.
Yeah.
All right.

1818
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:23.910
Moving to the next section here.

1819
01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:27.870
Page one 27 from tribal mentors.

1820
01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:30.120
Emilia Boon.

1821
01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:31.660
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1822
01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:35.740
<v 0>And she wakes up at like three o'clock in the morning.</v>

1823
01:49:38.050 --> 01:49:42.790
She's here and she's four time world champion in the sport of obstacle course

1824
01:49:42.791 --> 01:49:47.410
racing.
I met her a couple times.
You met her too?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1825
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:48.993
She's a beast.

1826
01:49:49.210 --> 01:49:54.210
And what's cool about her is she beats like she did the 2012 world's toughest

1827
01:49:57.341 --> 01:50:01.420
mudder competition.
It's 24 hours,
90 miles,

1828
01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.800
300 obstacles.

1829
01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:08.490
She finished second overall out of more than a thousand competitors,

1830
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:14.710
including 80% of which are male.
Second overall.

1831
01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:17.560
Did I have to say something about being durable earlier?

1832
01:50:19.450 --> 01:50:24.250
That's adorable.
So Emilia,
awesome human.

1833
01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:29.730
And
last one we'll do here,
but she,

1834
01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:31.510
she got asked the same question.

1835
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:35.860
If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it,

1836
01:50:35.861 --> 01:50:37.990
what would you say and why it?

1837
01:50:37.991 --> 01:50:42.430
Emilia says no one owes you anything.

1838
01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:46.870
We live in a world that's rampant with entitlement,

1839
01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:50.170
with many people believing that they deserve to be given more.

1840
01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:54.910
My parents raised me to be self sufficient and impressed upon me that the only

1841
01:50:54.911 --> 01:50:57.970
person you can really depend on them in life is you.

1842
01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.570
If you want something,
you work for it.

1843
01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:06.220
You don't expect it to be given.
If others help you along the way,

1844
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:08.200
that's fantastic,
but it's not a given.

1845
01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:14.290
I believe that the key to self sufficiency is breaking free of the mindset that

1846
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:19.291
someone somewhere owes you something or we'll come to your rescue.

1847
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:24.703
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:30.150
<v 0>No one owes you anything.
No one's coming to your rescue.</v>

1849
01:51:30.151 --> 01:51:34.590
It's on you.
Obviously I couldn't agree more.

1850
01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:38.900
It's funny because
as she said,
I mean we,

1851
01:51:38.901 --> 01:51:40.680
we know the importance of a team

1852
01:51:42.450 --> 01:51:44.580
and you always hear people say,
you know,

1853
01:51:44.581 --> 01:51:46.710
you can't do it by yourself and I'm not here.

1854
01:51:46.711 --> 01:51:49.290
I'm here because of so many different people and that's true,

1855
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000
but that doesn't mean that you can sit around and rely on other people to save

1856
01:51:57.151 --> 01:52:00.570
you or to do the heavy lifting or even help you out in any other way.

1857
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:05.130
Help from other people is a luxury.

1858
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:07.220
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1859
01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:10.880
<v 0>It's a luxury that you shouldn't count on,</v>

1860
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.160
so step up and own it and make it happen because no one owes you anything.

1861
01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:25.220
That book is tribe of Mentors,
Timothy Ferriss,
he's got Timothy,

1862
01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:29.200
not Timothy,
more
Timothy Ferris.

1863
01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:33.290
Good short life advice from the best in the world.

1864
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:40.160
All right.
Speaking of helping people echo Charles.
Yeah.

1865
01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:42.350
Maybe you can help people

1866
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:46.850
learn how support themselves.

1867
01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:47.750
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1868
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:52.490
and maybe if they want to also simultaneously support this podcast.

1869
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:57.020
If they were to that,
that would be fantastic,
but we're not relying on it.

1870
01:52:57.170 --> 01:53:01.190
Is that kind of the theme?
I'm hoping they flop.
Hey,
I got this.

1871
01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:05.810
I'll run with it.
Sure.
Oh yeah,
sure.
Of course.
Sure.

1872
01:53:05.811 --> 01:53:09.740
You want me to run with it cause I'll be done with it and like four minutes
here.

1873
01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:13.700
What's interesting is that kind of depend on you and rely on you to kind of help

1874
01:53:13.701 --> 01:53:17.570
bail me out in this podcast.
Otherwise they'd just be kind of talking to myself.

1875
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:19.460
Okay.
Check.

1876
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:22.640
Actually I wouldn't be talking because I typically talk after you t like in

1877
01:53:22.641 --> 01:53:26.300
reaction to you.
So if it was the echo podcast,

1878
01:53:26.301 --> 01:53:30.760
it would just be silence.
Yeah.
It wouldn't even be good evening because you sick,

1879
01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:35.030
you know,
eh,
no podcast check.
It's all good.

1880
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:39.410
So yeah,
support yourself.
Right.
All right.
We'll talk about Krill oil.

1881
01:53:39.411 --> 01:53:44.270
Jocko is Krill Oil Jocko.
Super Krill oil.
Super Super Grill.

1882
01:53:44.290 --> 01:53:49.040
Yeah.
And also Jocko Joint Warfare,
glucose.
We can join.

1883
01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.760
This is all for your joints.
Best type of supplement in my opinion.

1884
01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:58.770
You don't,
when have you been into other supplements?

1885
01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:02.030
Not in a long time.
Yeah.
So I've,

1886
01:54:02.090 --> 01:54:05.210
I have like in my younger days where I'll take like kind of no protein powder

1887
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.330
like this thing does this,
you know,

1888
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:14.950
I can say with full on honesty that when I stopped taking it there a difference.

1889
01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:20.780
You know what happens when you stop digging dirt warfare.
That's a thing.
Yeah.

1890
01:54:20.781 --> 01:54:23.780
So there is a difference.
And especially,
I mean,
I don't know,
I'm,

1891
01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:28.490
I'm whatever age I am now,
you don't have to go into that part,

1892
01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.710
but so I don't know.

1893
01:54:30.711 --> 01:54:34.370
I don't know how it is to take Krill oil when I was like in my twenties so I

1894
01:54:34.371 --> 01:54:36.530
don't know.
But I know now,

1895
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:39.590
and I'll tell you this and I have gotten off it for like a,

1896
01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:44.960
it was like maybe a week,
little,
little bit more than a week.
And yeah,
they could,

1897
01:54:44.961 --> 01:54:49.820
they came back man.
The joint situations,
you know what I think,
you know what?

1898
01:54:49.821 --> 01:54:54.740
I think the Krill oil and the joint warfare do make you durable.

1899
01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:56.810
Yeah,
they do.

1900
01:54:57.650 --> 01:55:02.210
I believe they contribute greatly to my durability.
Yeah.
And that's,

1901
01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:05.960
and it's actually saying a lot for me cause and for youtube big time because

1902
01:55:05.961 --> 01:55:10.430
you're,
you're not like a small guy and a smart person.
And let's face it,

1903
01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:11.960
we're older than we were before.

1904
01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:17.380
That is a true statement for you.

1905
01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.760
You,
we,
you actually more so than me.

1906
01:55:19.761 --> 01:55:24.761
You do like hard stuff like lifting Jujitsu like hard stuff.

1907
01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:30.920
Harder than the normal person.
Maybe some people,

1908
01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:35.440
not Emilia Boon 9,300 obstacle course,

1909
01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:40.400
90 miles.
Awesome.
Yeah.

1910
01:55:40.401 --> 01:55:44.610
See what up if she's not already on it or something like it.
Nonetheless,

1911
01:55:44.611 --> 01:55:47.520
the joint situation is like that saying a lot.

1912
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:52.550
If you can do the stuff that you do and I just kind of doing some introspection

1913
01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:58.200
kind of detaching,
whatever I'm looking at,
stuff that I do,
it's like men,

1914
01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:02.670
it helps a lot.
I don't think I'd be able to go as hard.
Oh No.

1915
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:06.140
When you definitely want him to like just daily my shoulder healed.
Yeah.

1916
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:07.910
My elbow straight of them.
Yeah.

1917
01:56:09.150 --> 01:56:11.760
And my knees probably put abuse so my knees with,

1918
01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:15.780
with like working out and Jiu cause they're kind of loose,
skinny.

1919
01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.510
I thought you said there but um,
like they're super loose.

1920
01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:26.340
Where when I blew out my knee in college,
the doctor,

1921
01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:29.040
when he,
you know,
they do the test tests,
I'm like okay.
Before they do the MRI,

1922
01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:30.960
they do the tests.
All of these tests,

1923
01:56:30.961 --> 01:56:33.840
they just kind of wiggle them and do all this stuff from different positions and

1924
01:56:33.841 --> 01:56:38.310
they wiggled both of them and they're like,
Bro,
your knees are loose.
Genetically,

1925
01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:39.960
they were skinny too.

1926
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:47.880
Anyway,
they were loose.
And then do,
you said you had skinny?
I do.

1927
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:49.343
And skinny ankles.

1928
01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.340
I,
um,

1929
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:59.340
then I hurt my knee when I was running with Greg and I went to the doctor who

1930
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:03.210
performed the surgeon bicep and he did,
he was like,
Oh yeah,
you have a blown ACL.

1931
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:06.330
And I was like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
I only have,

1932
01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:10.860
I heard the outside of my knee or the inside of any,
not the outside or not my,

1933
01:57:10.861 --> 01:57:13.770
I didn't blow out my knee.
It's like,
no,
you blew out your knee.
I was like,
Dang.

1934
01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:17.130
That was like,
oh.
But,
but he didn't run any comprehensive tests.

1935
01:57:17.131 --> 01:57:19.920
He just did it real quick,
like wiggled it.
And then I was like,
whoa.

1936
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:22.980
My doctor in college said I have really loose needs,
so check this one.

1937
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:23.460
And there is,

1938
01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:26.770
he had like another person there and he goes and he checks the other and he was

1939
01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:28.100
like,
Whoa,
whoa.

1940
01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:33.560
But the difference is when you wiggle a no ACL knee,

1941
01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:38.610
it doesn't like abruptly stop even if it's loose.
So what I'm saying,

1942
01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:41.310
so like if you have no ACL,
it's like,
it's like a blunt.

1943
01:57:41.311 --> 01:57:44.730
Like it's like if you had a,
a big a cord in there,

1944
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:47.280
like a real like attention chord or something that didn't,

1945
01:57:47.281 --> 01:57:50.460
didn't stretch at all and mine are just a little bit longer.

1946
01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.220
You see what I'm saying?
So I have at least needs nonetheless.
So the point is,

1947
01:57:53.221 --> 01:57:54.570
I know long explanation,
I understand

1948
01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:01.160
when I rolled you just so they'll pop out sometimes loose ends and then if,

1949
01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:06.180
if they pop out and then I like Kik or straighten out real quick or whatever,

1950
01:58:06.181 --> 01:58:09.270
it'll pop out.
And you know how your bones,
there's kind of shaped like this.

1951
01:58:09.271 --> 01:58:13.410
They'll do this and then they'll get like caught on each other and when they get

1952
01:58:13.411 --> 01:58:16.110
caught at each other and you press it,
it'll mess up the cartilage.
Yeah.

1953
01:58:16.590 --> 01:58:18.330
So they'll get swollen on the inside.

1954
01:58:18.331 --> 01:58:22.320
At the end of the day they get swollen for like some days I'm going to like warm

1955
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:26.130
up more or whatever.
But yeah,
I take,
I just take the Krill oil.
I don't,

1956
01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:29.160
I just ignore the swelling,
no factor,

1957
01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:33.210
and I'm pretty flexible to nonetheless.
Anyway.

1958
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:36.000
You want to support yourself.
There you go.
Jocko.

1959
01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.640
Super crude oil and joint warfare.
Boom.

1960
01:58:38.670 --> 01:58:42.970
Physical support on your supportive structures.
Also if you're in,

1961
01:58:42.971 --> 01:58:45.190
did you get to origin?

1962
01:58:45.930 --> 01:58:46.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:50.550
<v 3>Has a new key.
What is it?
Your signature g,</v>

1964
01:58:50.551 --> 01:58:55.290
is that what you call it and all about all that.
The it says cool stuff on it.

1965
01:58:55.291 --> 01:58:57.480
Yeah,
because freedom get accurate.
Yeah.

1966
01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:02.010
So I guess technically as far as what a signature something we'd be,
yeah,

1967
01:59:02.011 --> 01:59:06.020
that's the Jocko.
Gee,
it's not called the Jocko Homo.
We wouldn't be having,

1968
01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:08.600
I guess we have a chocolate potty.
Yeah,

1969
01:59:08.610 --> 01:59:12.210
but that's just for a lack of a better name is really true.
This one.
Yeah.
No.

1970
01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:15.790
Well anyway,
they see the deaf [inaudible].
Yup.
Disciplining closer.

1971
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:20.820
Edo g good on kind of lighter weight.
It's,
I'm Pete told DC.
Pete.

1972
01:59:20.821 --> 01:59:24.790
Pete said that the,
the we've athletic,
we've,

1973
01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:28.800
it's a real meal.
We've,
yeah.
It's not just taking cotton,

1974
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:30.143
which is what,

1975
01:59:30.810 --> 01:59:35.040
which is what they just make pants from 1908 from,

1976
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:38.000
it's an athletic and when you put it in the Dryer,
oh,

1977
01:59:38.030 --> 01:59:40.020
you put it in the washing machine.
When you get down,
it's almost dry.

1978
01:59:40.021 --> 01:59:44.460
It's got cotton in it,
but it's also got a poly blend.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1979
01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:45.353
The good stuff.

1980
01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:50.220
And it's all made here in America from the seed of the cotton,

1981
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:52.140
the very seed that you plant the seed.

1982
01:59:52.141 --> 01:59:54.160
I wonder if where they get the seeds from Charlie here.

1983
01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:59.760
Either Tennessee or South Carolina.
Yeah.
So we'll find out.
Yeah.

1984
01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:01.320
You've been buying the seeds or,

1985
02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:05.040
or acquiring the seeds in whatever capacity is here in America.

1986
02:00:05.130 --> 02:00:08.130
Planted in America.
Cotton grows in American harvest did in America,

1987
02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:12.690
obviously died in America,
died in America.
It's up to Maine.

1988
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:17.400
Repeat weaves it in a bunch of loans into fabric.

1989
02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:23.270
Any diggies boom,
right on your back to start rolling on.
Made in America.

1990
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:27.200
That's all the stuff at the origin,
by the way,
if you don't know already.
Yeah,

1991
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:29.540
they got some good rash guards and compression gear,

1992
02:00:29.541 --> 02:00:34.541
which is what the same thing the rash guards I've noticed cause I didn't use to

1993
02:00:35.631 --> 02:00:39.180
use rash guards other than for surfing.
Yeah.

1994
02:00:39.890 --> 02:00:40.880
Do you notice,

1995
02:00:42.150 --> 02:00:42.730
<v 2>okay,</v>

1996
02:00:42.730 --> 02:00:44.380
<v 3>you feel a little bit,
uh,</v>

1997
02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:50.350
like the compression helps you athletically.
Do you feel that?
I don't feel that.

1998
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:54.890
No,
but the,
no,
I don't think I'm paying attention to be honest with you.
Placebo,

1999
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:55.910
I'm just trying to apps.

2000
02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:59.900
What about people that get 19% improvement in their Jujitsu skills?
That's real.

2001
02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:04.440
That's 100% real but me,
what,
you know,
as far as I,

2002
02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:06.610
but I hear good things about compression.

2003
02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:11.470
Like I see the links to articles that say all the performance benefits and all

2004
02:01:11.471 --> 02:01:14.020
this stuff.
Here's the thing,
I don't read them.
I don't know.

2005
02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:18.010
So I wear knee pads when I roll.
Yeah.

2006
02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:22.510
And I wear them for two reasons.
Well I wear them for three reasons.
Number one,

2007
02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:26.830
just uh,
abrasions on the knee.
Right,
right.
Whatever.

2008
02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:30.100
Matt Byrne on your knee,
which is cool.
You get it.
Maybe you get it.

2009
02:01:30.490 --> 02:01:34.690
Maybe you get it once every three days.
That's once every three days.

2010
02:01:34.691 --> 02:01:38.080
You got Matt Byrne on your knee and you've got blood and you got people that are

2011
02:01:38.081 --> 02:01:40.280
like,
Hey,
I don't want to roll with you cause you're bleeding or whatever.

2012
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.380
<v 1>So that's just a pain number two.</v>

2013
02:01:44.850 --> 02:01:48.720
It for me keeps them warm.
Right?
The ordinary sleeve.

2014
02:01:48.930 --> 02:01:50.820
It just warms up your knees.
And number three,

2015
02:01:50.821 --> 02:01:53.250
it provides a little bit of compression.
That makes me feel good.

2016
02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:56.160
Now I feel when I put on a rash guard,

2017
02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:01.320
I feel like that on my body,
which is good.
I don't know.

2018
02:02:01.410 --> 02:02:06.240
I think it feels good.
Yeah.
So I can't speak really on it,

2019
02:02:06.241 --> 02:02:10.290
but I for damn sure can't speak against it.
And it's all made in America,

2020
02:02:10.410 --> 02:02:15.300
in America,
and they're dope.
Do some research if that even matters.
You don't,

2021
02:02:15.301 --> 02:02:18.930
does that matter that much?
Well,

2022
02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:24.440
well you wear it because it's efficient to roll in for sure.

2023
02:02:24.930 --> 02:02:27.870
The most efficient thing you can roll in is a rash guard.
Yeah,

2024
02:02:27.871 --> 02:02:32.300
I feel like like a,
that's the uniform B.
All the,

2025
02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:36.360
the woody call it Ergonomic,
Ergonomic.
It's like,

2026
02:02:36.361 --> 02:02:38.010
you know how like you said the mat burning,

2027
02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:40.080
you don't give mapper and like all day every day.
Yeah.

2028
02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:44.730
If you're going super hard and your knee or your elbow or whatever it happens to

2029
02:02:44.731 --> 02:02:48.150
be against the mat at it,
you know,
it's like,
it's a happenstance situation.

2030
02:02:48.151 --> 02:02:52.370
Unless you knew,
unless you're new,
you're getting back burner lines,

2031
02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:54.960
proprioception to keep you from getting,
hey,

2032
02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:58.140
notice if you haven't enrolled for a long time,
you'll get your feet,

2033
02:02:58.141 --> 02:03:01.890
get all of mat burned up,
your knees,
get all Matt burned up.

2034
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:06.870
You know when you're,
when you know when you're in the role mode,

2035
02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:10.890
you barely get Matt Byrne get it like once every three or four roles.

2036
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:13.800
They'll the once every three or four days you'll get a little map burn on the

2037
02:03:13.801 --> 02:03:16.560
top of your toes.
Or Bro,
I haven't had met Brendan told him.

2038
02:03:16.561 --> 02:03:20.700
I told him like long time.
Oh,
it's like,
yeah,
it's like your skin gets smart.

2039
02:03:20.730 --> 02:03:23.070
You're like,
oh,
what are we doing?
Rolling.
Okay.
We gotta toughen up right now.

2040
02:03:23.130 --> 02:03:24.800
Have you ever rolled on like a resume,
right?

2041
02:03:24.801 --> 02:03:28.980
Wrestling Mat Barefoot after you've been rolling on a hard to Tommy Matt for

2042
02:03:28.981 --> 02:03:32.890
awhile.
It takes like a week to get used to it.
Why?

2043
02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:37.080
Because you will stub your toe a bunch cause your toes won't know where to go

2044
02:03:37.110 --> 02:03:38.370
cause they're deeper and softer.

2045
02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:41.370
It's like when you play football on grass and then you go to our artificial

2046
02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:43.430
material,
you've got to get used to that.
Yeah,
it's weird.
Yeah.

2047
02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:48.210
<v 3>Well that's true.
Anyway.
Cool.
Compression gear.
Good.</v>

2048
02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:52.020
I'm glad that it's compression because some people do care about that and I

2049
02:03:52.021 --> 02:03:55.530
think that if you know one of those people well if you know the benefits and

2050
02:03:55.531 --> 02:03:58.520
you're benefiting from it,
there you go.
Boom.
I just,

2051
02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:01.140
I don't think I just been paying attention but after this,

2052
02:04:01.141 --> 02:04:05.490
guess what I will because I'm not always right about things as far as the way I

2053
02:04:05.491 --> 02:04:07.310
look at them.
Also

2054
02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:11.700
also I want to talk about on it.

2055
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:17.520
So I would go into my whole kettle bell routine,

2056
02:04:17.521 --> 02:04:20.250
which I smashed yesterday.
By the way.

2057
02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:25.550
I got a new cyclops one by the way.
Um,

2058
02:04:26.670 --> 02:04:30.810
so again,
cool.

2059
02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.120
<v 1>If you there are regular kettle bells,</v>

2060
02:04:32.121 --> 02:04:35.330
the regular ones that's good cause doing kettle bells is way better than not

2061
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:38.010
doing Kettlebell is one I recommend is you get

2062
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:42.870
<v 3>the good ones.
The Dope uh,
decorative artistic deck.</v>

2063
02:04:42.871 --> 02:04:45.330
I don't like decorative.
You liked decorative the word Decca?
No,

2064
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:50.360
I'm here to win artistic artistic kettlebells.

2065
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:52.920
I say get those ones.
They're just way cool.

2066
02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:56.730
Especially if you're into Instagram stuff.
That's what I think.

2067
02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.890
It's my opinion nonetheless.
They got regular ones as well.

2068
02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:01.680
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko they have a bunch of fitness stuff I

2069
02:05:01.681 --> 02:05:06.681
noticed Jockos Mace that he recommended I use for like other stuff which is

2070
02:05:09.121 --> 02:05:12.540
actually part of a big point that you can use a lot of this stuff for like

2071
02:05:12.570 --> 02:05:17.400
various different sorts of exercise activities and they have like a bunch of

2072
02:05:17.401 --> 02:05:22.401
cool stuff on there like gum stuff that's different from your traditional bench

2073
02:05:23.970 --> 02:05:26.340
squat.
You know like functional stuff.

2074
02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.700
Check unless audit.com/ [inaudible] go there,
boom.

2075
02:05:30.701 --> 02:05:34.500
Support Yourself,
expand your workout man.
If you want,

2076
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:39.830
you can be like Jocko does the same thing over and over and over and over and

2077
02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:42.580
over and over and over again.
Very.
Yeah,

2078
02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:47.580
but they vary over and over and they also have some strong,
actually,

2079
02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:50.790
to be honest with myself,

2080
02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:53.910
I do the same exact workout all the time with variations,

2081
02:05:53.911 --> 02:05:57.060
but those variations will come in cycles.
They go over it.

2082
02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:59.670
But that's kind of the whole point of a workout though.

2083
02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:02.430
It's like your body gets used to certain activities.

2084
02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:06.000
You can't let it get too used to it.
Right.
That's why they say,
you know,

2085
02:06:06.001 --> 02:06:08.040
you gotta switch it up,
all the shock,
your body,
all this stuff.

2086
02:06:08.041 --> 02:06:10.670
But if you're constantly just shocking your body,
it's like,
okay,
where do we,

2087
02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:14.070
your buddies kind of saying this to you.
It's like,
okay,
what are we doing?

2088
02:06:14.130 --> 02:06:16.440
I'm going to get as good at it as possible.
Okay,

2089
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:19.950
so however many times we got to do this thing,
I'm going to try my best.

2090
02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:23.100
As long as you feed me and arrest me,
I'm gonna try my best to accommodate you.

2091
02:06:23.370 --> 02:06:26.370
As far as you know,
getting better at this thing.
No.

2092
02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:29.640
If you give me one thing to do and say get good at that,

2093
02:06:29.641 --> 02:06:31.800
we're never doing it again.
You're not there.

2094
02:06:31.810 --> 02:06:36.060
There's no real results except for maybe the underlying system,
you know,

2095
02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:40.530
maybe like your heart rate or your,
you know,
those types of things.
Maybe your um,

2096
02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:42.900
what do you call your,
you know,

2097
02:06:42.901 --> 02:06:47.010
when you can endure like hard stuff meant durable.
Yeah,
like mental durability.

2098
02:06:47.011 --> 02:06:49.920
Maybe that,
but no,
if you do like one exercise,

2099
02:06:49.921 --> 02:06:53.460
sure you'll be sore and then that's kind of hit the benefits of that program

2100
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:56.070
won't really,
then again,
I don't know,
I could be wrong.

2101
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:59.700
It could be missing like some new science on whole deal.
Nonetheless,

2102
02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:04.380
research it,
get a good workout routine and if you want to expand it,

2103
02:07:04.890 --> 02:07:08.670
got on it cause they have the good stuff.

2104
02:07:09.690 --> 02:07:10.523
Also,

2105
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:16.350
if you want to get Timothy Ferriss book that Jocko was quoting,

2106
02:07:16.650 --> 02:07:21.420
jock was in there by the way.
How many,
how many coats do you have in there?

2107
02:07:21.630 --> 02:07:26.120
I Dunno.
11 disaster persons,
Jocko.

2108
02:07:26.121 --> 02:07:30.690
So these,
and they're the same,
right?
They're the same as the one,

2109
02:07:30.691 --> 02:07:32.580
all this stuff.
Yeah.
And here's the thing,

2110
02:07:32.581 --> 02:07:36.790
like Tim will post like little excerpts of like just little quotes,
you know?

2111
02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:40.420
And that's really interesting thing that he did there where he asked everyone

2112
02:07:40.421 --> 02:07:43.480
the same question because that's the kind of person,
Tim's personality.

2113
02:07:43.481 --> 02:07:45.810
He looks for patterns and yeah,
that's when,

2114
02:07:45.811 --> 02:07:48.580
that's how you find patterns that super cyber like it's,

2115
02:07:48.581 --> 02:07:53.581
so it's basically you have 11 categories of advice that you can get from these

2116
02:07:54.041 --> 02:07:58.630
top level people in different industries,
different.
And then he's got like,
uh,

2117
02:07:58.810 --> 02:07:58.991
he's,

2118
02:07:58.991 --> 02:08:03.820
he's kind of sorts them in the back so you can see what everyone,

2119
02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:08.530
he,
he kind of assembles the information in some various ways in the back of the

2120
02:08:08.531 --> 02:08:13.370
book.
So you can sort of pull pool the knowledge.
You haven't,

2121
02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:17.800
it's a quicker,
that's good.
Yeah,
man,
I actually liked that kind of.
Um,

2122
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:20.500
but that is smart though.
So that's essentially what you have.

2123
02:08:20.501 --> 02:08:24.960
You have this big book of advice from all these complete complete experts.

2124
02:08:25.050 --> 02:08:29.530
That is exactly what it is.
Eh,
so there you go.

2125
02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:33.190
When you get that and just go here,
look,
we'll offer it Jocko,

2126
02:08:33.191 --> 02:08:37.360
podcast.com go on the top,
top menu books from the episodes.
Boom,

2127
02:08:37.361 --> 02:08:41.800
I got you right there.
Tribe of mentors by Timothy Ferriss.
Click through.

2128
02:08:41.801 --> 02:08:45.310
There is a good way to support if you want to shop for anything else.
Good.

2129
02:08:45.311 --> 02:08:47.980
Do that.
Carry on.
Men support away.

2130
02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:54.070
Some people think that that's not a big deal.
It is a big deal.

2131
02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:59.260
Just clicking through there.
I mean it is a big deal.
It's hard to do.
Easy to do.

2132
02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:03.860
Small action,
small action.
Big Reaction.
Yup.

2133
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:07.090
Just like sodium when you throw it into water.
Anyway,

2134
02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:11.170
subscribe to the podcast.
Youtube.

2135
02:09:12.370 --> 02:09:17.020
That's for the video version,
but on iTunes and Google,
play,
stitcher,

2136
02:09:17.021 --> 02:09:18.160
all on podcasting,

2137
02:09:18.730 --> 02:09:22.900
providing platforms seems seems obvious,
but you know,

2138
02:09:22.930 --> 02:09:25.690
if you haven't already subscribed,
it's good way to support also youtube,

2139
02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:28.480
like I said,
video version of this podcast.
Also excerpts.

2140
02:09:28.481 --> 02:09:33.481
If you want to share a little ideas that have emerged from the podcast,

2141
02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:37.030
you want to share them individually.
They're on there.
Most of them,

2142
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:41.980
I'll work on them every week.
Put them on there,
you can share them.

2143
02:09:42.210 --> 02:09:46.330
It's a good reason to subscribe to the Youtube.
Also put some,
uh,

2144
02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:49.000
you know how people,
what what's called?
There's like Mashups,

2145
02:09:49.001 --> 02:09:53.320
they're called mashups.
When you put like an excerpt of your voice,

2146
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:56.180
they put music videos.
Yes.
They put some video so that,

2147
02:09:56.190 --> 02:09:59.850
you know from visual aid is what it's called.
Where do you make mash make?

2148
02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:04.030
I don't,
here's the thing though.
So a Mashup is like you just take various clips,

2149
02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:05.770
you know,
whatever,
you know,

2150
02:10:05.771 --> 02:10:09.280
like they're just visually and you do like a whole sematic thing and that's kind

2151
02:10:09.281 --> 02:10:13.150
of the thing.
So I don't know,
maybe a while though says and it really kind of,

2152
02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:17.510
I don't know,
sometimes they get hard.
Um,
yeah.

2153
02:10:17.570 --> 02:10:22.570
Kinda no block read the war of art or I might be just working diligently and

2154
02:10:24.161 --> 02:10:24.791
obsessive.

2155
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:29.020
Lee On may be new approaches and methods put the war of art on their part on our

2156
02:10:29.230 --> 02:10:33.530
site too so people can get that.
The war of art.
Yeah.
I read down this is good.

2157
02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:34.370
Yeah.

2158
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:38.660
I need to maybe revisit it for this video production standpoint.

2159
02:10:39.170 --> 02:10:43.040
Nonetheless,
when I do make those videos,

2160
02:10:43.041 --> 02:10:47.210
I put them on youtube and that's yet another reason to subscribe on top of the

2161
02:10:47.211 --> 02:10:51.680
fact that it does support the podcast,
so it's like a big circle loop of support.

2162
02:10:51.681 --> 02:10:56.390
You see what I'm saying?
Also Daca has a store,
it was called Jocko store.

2163
02:10:56.490 --> 02:11:01.430
[inaudible] dot com is where you can get your discipline equals freedom shirt

2164
02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:02.600
get after it,

2165
02:11:02.601 --> 02:11:07.400
shirt and other shirts of that tight.

2166
02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:10.130
Also rash guards on their new rash guards on there.

2167
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:17.570
Two new rash guards on there,
I don't know,
two or three.

2168
02:11:17.571 --> 02:11:21.320
You got to look Jocko pot or Jacqueline store.com the rash guard is sodium.

2169
02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:27.110
Small action reaction.
That's a rash guard.
I Dunno.
I got to take the pictures.

2170
02:11:27.111 --> 02:11:30.650
I got to list them,
you know.
So during that process,

2171
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:36.310
hopefully sound like that's real hard to get pictures and lists.

2172
02:11:36.371 --> 02:11:37.090
I'm,
I'm trying to,

2173
02:11:37.090 --> 02:11:41.150
anyone want a job out there in the world and he was a hard time taking pictures

2174
02:11:41.151 --> 02:11:42.180
of a rash guard warrior.

2175
02:11:42.181 --> 02:11:47.181
Your kid rash guards for youth for the war.

2176
02:11:47.431 --> 02:11:51.140
Your kids themselves.
So look out for that.

2177
02:11:51.170 --> 02:11:56.150
My little daughter was sporting hers today.
I know.
It looks good.
It looks very,

2178
02:11:56.151 --> 02:11:58.160
very,
very,
very good.
Nonetheless,

2179
02:11:58.161 --> 02:12:01.220
they're on their drugstore.com cuts some hats on their beanies coming as well.

2180
02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:06.080
Um,
and you know,
other stuff on there.
I'm not saying go buy a beanie.

2181
02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:09.290
I'm not saying that you might not need one.
Maybe you're in Hawaii,
eh,

2182
02:12:09.390 --> 02:12:11.210
but you were being in Hawaii just for the deck,

2183
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:16.750
but maybe you're in shy town and you need to be in Michigan somewhere.

2184
02:12:17.330 --> 02:12:20.750
Dang.
Nonetheless.
Go in there.
If he like something,

2185
02:12:20.751 --> 02:12:24.320
get something good way to support also psychological warfare on your campaign

2186
02:12:24.321 --> 02:12:26.360
against weakness.
That's where we're going with right now.

2187
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:30.440
Campaign against weakness.
Improving yourself.

2188
02:12:31.190 --> 02:12:35.810
You're going from a person who with,
who is incapable of detaching,

2189
02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:40.920
who is incapable of understanding the message rather than your feeling about the

2190
02:12:41.151 --> 02:12:42.890
message.
You're,
if you're that person,

2191
02:12:42.891 --> 02:12:45.380
yet you're on the path to become a different person.

2192
02:12:45.381 --> 02:12:48.830
Someone who can understand the message first,
feeling second,

2193
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:50.390
the ability to detach.

2194
02:12:50.391 --> 02:12:52.880
We're always working on and if you're working on that as well,

2195
02:12:53.330 --> 02:12:56.150
this is what you do.
You hit those moments of weakness.

2196
02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:58.550
You have this album with tracks.

2197
02:12:58.610 --> 02:13:01.670
Jocko track's called psychological warfare.

2198
02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:07.160
What it does is it takes any little element of your campaigning.
It's weakness.

2199
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:09.790
Any little element that you might slip on the,

2200
02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:13.810
you might see that I sounded like you were at Thursday.
That might slip on it.
Oh,

2201
02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:16.280
may feel a little weak

2202
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:21.200
when you wake up or when you're about to wake up,
when you're about to get up,

2203
02:13:21.201 --> 02:13:24.050
when you wake up,
you're about to get up.
It's four 30 and you're like,
Dang,

2204
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:27.500
I'm going to press the snooze dory.
There's a track for that.
You play that track.

2205
02:13:27.501 --> 02:13:32.070
Jocko,
give you pragmatic advice on why you hit this news.

2206
02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:34.080
<v 1>Same thing goes for skipping your workout.</v>

2207
02:13:34.081 --> 02:13:38.770
Same thing goes for skimping on your diet,
slipping on your day.
Um,

2208
02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:40.200
creative,
blah,
procrastinate.

2209
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:43.470
All these things is like tracks for where Jack was telling you why you shouldn't

2210
02:13:43.471 --> 02:13:45.450
do that.
It's like,
Hey,
don't do that.
You know,

2211
02:13:45.451 --> 02:13:49.410
this is why this is why it's beneficial for you to continue.
All that stuff.

2212
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.921
It's a good one.

2213
02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:54.921
It helps hundred percent effective in spotting people when they need a little

2214
02:13:57.811 --> 02:14:00.780
spot.
If then if you need a spot,
sometimes you don't need a spot.

2215
02:14:00.781 --> 02:14:03.570
Sometimes you just get an afternoon,
hundred percent,

2216
02:14:04.230 --> 02:14:05.190
but that's a good one for that.

2217
02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:09.540
You also on Amazon can get Jocko white tea,

2218
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:12.600
which is good.
If you don't believe me,

2219
02:14:12.601 --> 02:14:16.590
go read the reviews on there are read some of them.
I've,
again,

2220
02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:20.280
I read a couple of them on here,
but you can read them yourself.
The reviews.

2221
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:23.250
Explain that when you drink Jocko white tea,

2222
02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:28.320
you can deadlift 8,000 pounds at a minimum.

2223
02:14:28.770 --> 02:14:32.580
So that's a guarantee.
People don't understand guaranteed.

2224
02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.550
If you don't think,
if you can't,
I'll give you your money back to the team.

2225
02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.580
Uh,
also got some books.
You can get them anywhere.

2226
02:14:42.610 --> 02:14:47.460
Really weigh the warrior kid.
Thank you everyone.

2227
02:14:47.461 --> 02:14:49.470
It gives me feedback all the time.

2228
02:14:50.010 --> 02:14:55.010
Kids that are doing various things like studying,

2229
02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:00.120
like reading the book,
studying,
doing Jujitsu,
doing pull ups,

2230
02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:03.120
swimming,
competing,
just all kinds of awesome stuff.

2231
02:15:03.121 --> 02:15:04.980
Everything from figure skating.

2232
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:08.580
It's a ballet to wrestling scene at all.

2233
02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:11.670
Little warrior kids getting after it.

2234
02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:17.370
That's a book for any kid that you want to put on the proper path

2235
02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:23.520
of discipline of hard work.
The next book,

2236
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:28.790
the next Warrior Kid book is coming out April 28th I'll let you know when it

2237
02:15:29.401 --> 02:15:34.230
pops up for preorder
extreme ownership.
The new edition is out.

2238
02:15:34.231 --> 02:15:37.590
It's longer.
It has a little new forward in it.
It's got some new pictures,

2239
02:15:37.591 --> 02:15:42.450
color pictures by the way.
Color stepping it up.
No,
I don't like that.
I was like,

2240
02:15:42.451 --> 02:15:45.210
no.
Make them black and white.
Black and white only.
That's how I roll.

2241
02:15:46.170 --> 02:15:50.290
There's also some Q and a on there.
Witches,

2242
02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:55.320
the Q and a that's in the new version is from this podcast,

2243
02:15:56.491 --> 02:15:58.230
which means it's from you listeners,

2244
02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:01.980
so thank you for the questions and also the new version.
It's black

2245
02:16:03.570 --> 02:16:07.640
and it's flat black.
Did you notice that?
Flat Black?
Did you notice that?
Yeah.

2246
02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:10.980
That makes it even better than just regular black.
Well,

2247
02:16:11.130 --> 02:16:14.940
what's the regular black glossy.
Oh,
glossy.
You hear that dog barking?

2248
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:22.410
Yeah.
There must be somebody invading the podcast space.

2249
02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:26.160
Uh,
yeah.
You can get the new version of extreme ownership right now.

2250
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:29.980
Flat black questions from the podcast,
all that.
Also

2251
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:34.240
<v 0>discipline equals freedom field manual.
So,
um,</v>

2252
02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:38.530
this book is not a normal book,
right?

2253
02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:42.910
We know that it's a book that when you,

2254
02:16:42.930 --> 02:16:46.350
if you give it to somebody,
they don't feel like all,

2255
02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:47.440
he just went to grab me a book.

2256
02:16:47.470 --> 02:16:51.130
They don't feel like that Dang cause it's not normal.

2257
02:16:51.610 --> 02:16:54.490
So the publisher knows that.
Right.

2258
02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:58.390
So they wanted a little tagline and they sent me some,

2259
02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:03.490
hey we come up with some taglines and they gave me this tagline.

2260
02:17:03.940 --> 02:17:06.760
Sure.
Can I make fun of my publisher?
Yes.

2261
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:11.380
Sounds like I'm going to do that right now.
So my publisher,

2262
02:17:11.710 --> 02:17:15.850
they say we got to make a little tag line.
You can tell your buck.

2263
02:17:17.170 --> 02:17:19.270
And they said well you know,
here's our tagline.

2264
02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:22.190
This book makes it makes a great gift for the holiday season.

2265
02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:27.550
Something like that.
Right.
And they send me,
cause cause I always say like,

2266
02:17:27.551 --> 02:17:31.720
hey don't be saying stuff about my stuff without asking me first.

2267
02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:35.110
Cause you guys will say dumb stuff about my cool stuff.
And I'm like that.

2268
02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:41.500
So they said this book makes a great holiday gift or whatever,

2269
02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:42.520
and I said,
no,
we,

2270
02:17:42.550 --> 02:17:46.570
I thought about it for four seconds and I wrote them back and I said,

2271
02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:47.620
use this.

2272
02:17:49.290 --> 02:17:53.980
There is no better gift than the gift of discipline.
Boom.
Factually,

2273
02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:55.060
there's your tagline.

2274
02:17:55.540 --> 02:18:00.540
So for your people in your life that you don't want to get them a stupid gift

2275
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:07.230
like a neck tie or a belt or something else that they don't want or need.

2276
02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:11.140
They need this book.

2277
02:18:11.890 --> 02:18:15.580
The best gift you can give the gift of discipline.

2278
02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:18.370
So there you go.
That's a hey by the way,

2279
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:21.730
people keep asking me and I keep telling everyone,

2280
02:18:21.731 --> 02:18:24.320
everyone wants the audio version of this book and they say,

2281
02:18:24.321 --> 02:18:27.280
when is it coming out?
It's out.
It's out.

2282
02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:31.720
The audio version of discipline equals freedom field manual.

2283
02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:35.800
It's outright now it's on iTunes,

It's on Google play.

2284

It's on all the MP three platforms.

2285
02:18:38.051 --> 02:18:41.170
The reason we did that is because of you got put it on all the bull,

2286
02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:42.550
all the bull.

2287
02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:47.580
You can't pull it out as tracks and use it for alarm or use it to spot yourself.

2288
02:18:48.521 --> 02:18:50.740
If you get a moment of weakness,
which this book is good for,

2289
02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:56.080
so that's where you can get the audio version of beyond the books beyond the

Thank you for your sacrifice day to day.

2304

It is much appreciated.
And to the police,

2311
02:20:31.251 --> 02:20:34.430
great,
but don't count on them.

2312
02:20:35.970 --> 02:20:40.800
Don't wait for them.
Don't assume that they are coming to the rescue.

2313
02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:42.930
<v 2>Okay?</v>

2314
