This is Jocko podcast number 71 with Echo Charles and me,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.560
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.873
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.240
<v 0>A helmet for my pillow,
a Poncho for my bed.</v>

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.940
My rifle rests across my chest.

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.630
The stars swing overhead into your holes and gun pits.

7
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.580
Kill them with rifles and knives.

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.910
Feed them with led until they are dead and widowed are their wives.

9
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.170
Sons of the mothers who gave you honoring gift of birth.

10
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.650
Strike with the knife till blood and life run out upon the earth.

11
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.770
Marines.
Keep faith with your glory.

12
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.290
Keep to you're trembling.

13
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:59.190
Whole intruder fuel of Nippon Steel.

14
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.320
Can't penetrate your soul.

15
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.630
<v 1>Okay,</v>

16
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.380
<v 0>closing.
They charge all howling their breasts.</v>

17
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:08.090
All targets large.

18
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.450
The gun must shake the bullets make a slaughter of their charge.

19
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.790
<v 1>Okay,</v>

20
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.500
<v 0>red are the flashing tracers.
Yellow,
the bursting shells.</v>

21
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.440
Horses.
The cry of men who die shrill are the wound.

22
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:26.620
It's yells.

23
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.560
<v 1>Okay</v>

24
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.041
<v 0>God.</v>

25
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:34.041
How the night real stricken she streaks with orange spark.

26
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.101
The mortars,

27
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:39.780
Lash and the canons crash have crucified the dark

28
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.600
Saint Michael Angel of battle.
We praise you to God on high.

29
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.940
The fo you gave was strong and brave and on afraid to die.

30
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

31
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.690
<v 0>speak to the Lord for our comrades killed when the battle seemed lost,</v>

32
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.570
they went to meet a bright defeat.

33
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.200
The hero's holocaust false is the vault of the victor MTR living pride for those

34
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:13.370
who fell.

35
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.170
There is no hell not for the brave who died.

36
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.203
That's

37
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.490
a excerpt from a poem that opens a book called Helmet for my pillow.

38
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.700
Then the book was written by a guy named Robert Lucky.

39
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.190
<v 0>Otherwise no one is lucky.</v>

41
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.370
Everybody called him lucky and he was a machine gunner and then a scout with the

42
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:55.831
first marine division in World War II and he's up decent part of the HBO series,

43
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.300
the Pacific,
which is,
if you haven't watched that,

44
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.880
just buy it right now and watch it.

45
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.030
It's awesome and it's based on a bunch of different books and a bunch of

46
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.610
different events from the Pacific and a lot of them.
Eugene sledge,

47
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.110
that's another one with the old breed.
There's a lot that he plays a main role.

48
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.860
John Basilone plays,
plays a large role in that series.

49
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.030
And there's other,
a bunch of other books we've bought.

50
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:33.031
We've done a bunch of them on this podcast and this one is another one.

51
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.570
And you think to your,
and I was thinking to myself like,
well,
you know,

52
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.700
should I do helmet for my pillow?

53
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.640
I'd read it a long time ago and I thought to myself,
you know,

54
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:45.010
we've kind of covered,
you know,

55
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:48.640
the Pacific pretty well and I'm just straight up wrong.

56
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.790
So wrong because everyone's experience is different.

57
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.750
There's things that are the same.
And his viewpoint on things is,

58
00:03:55.751 --> 00:04:00.751
is just a different viewpoint and equally important to understanding not only

59
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.660
the war,
not only what they experienced in war,

60
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.220
but also a whole nother side of human nature that we need to learn about.

61
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.723
<v 1>And</v>

62
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.620
<v 0>yeah,
there's,
there are a lot to go over.
So a little,</v>

63
00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:22.640
there's a little introduction here and just to give you a little background on,

64
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.560
on Lucky,
lucky he enlisted on January 5th,

65
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.860
1942 he tried to join up the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor,

66
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.740
but a surgically correctable condition.
Disqualified him.

67
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

68
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.080
<v 0>Now he was back and acceptable.
Just that tells us a lot.</v>

69
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.980
He was a civilian,
not a professional fighting man,

70
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.950
but he became a warrior.

71
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.450
<v 0>The author was one of those young men,</v>

73
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.870
many not yet 20 who were gentle human beings that were transformed by training

74
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.450
hardship and the war into fighting marines.

75
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.860
These were the boys who became men that stood against and then beat back two of

76
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:14.620
the world's most vicious fighting machines.

77
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.600
They left behind them a heritage of decency.

78
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.670
<v 0>That hopefully will live
forever.</v>

80
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.200
Then that's from the introduction and,

81
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.673
<v 1>okay,</v>

82
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.830
<v 0>so again,
after World War,
after Pearl Harbor,
there was so many,</v>

83
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.960
you've seen pictures using seen pictures of guys wrapped around the block

84
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.720
waiting to go to the recruiting office and he goes,
the recruiting office,

85
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.760
he'd can't go in at first.
Eventually it gets in,

86
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:53.530
it takes them a month to get in and then he's off to boot camp and we've seen

87
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:58.531
all kinds of representations in books and movies of Marine Corps bootcamp and in

88
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:00.230
bootcamp of jet in general.

89
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.130
But I just had to hit on this one a little bit because it's just another

90
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.400
perspective that shows you,
shows you his son,

91
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.610
his view of it and gave me a,

92
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.890
not even a bedroom understanding a clearer understanding of what,

93
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.910
what people are going through when they're going through boot camp.

94
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.600
And I remember actually I remember this about bootcamp.

95
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.650
I they,
they wrote,
we had to write something when I was going through bootcamp,

96
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.070
and I don't know if I've talked about this before,

97
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.690
but we're going through bootcamp.
They said,
hey,
write down,
you know,

98
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.730
the top three things you're learning,
right?
You had to,
we all had to,
okay,

99
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.760
this is Navy boot camp and I wrote down something along the lines of,

100
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.550
I wrote something along the lines of the brainwashing seems very effective.

101
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.710
Right?
I'll hold you.

102
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.770
I was 1818 or nine I think I just turned 19 and that's cause I was a rebellious

103
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:59.770
kid.
Right.
And so I'm thinking they're brainwashing us and I wasn't against it.
I,

104
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.750
it was kind of one of those statements where I was saying I was kind of being

105
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.660
sarcastic,
but it's also kind of being true to form.

106
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.010
We call it cracking but FAC yet.
Okay,
we'll roll with that.

107
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.490
So that's what I was doing.
And,

108
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.350
and I remember they didn't say anything about anything anyone had written about

109
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:21.330
what we were learning or whatever they called that one out.
The,
the,

110
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.430
the chiefs that were running my bootcamp company,
they will,
you know,
say,

111
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.190
and if you think you're getting brainwashed,
do you know what this is,

112
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:31.250
what's going to save you?
And he went on this big thing to counter my,

113
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.780
my assessment.
So there's a little bit of that here.

114
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.130
In what,
what,
what lucky saying,

115
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.030
he says the same kind of thing and he gets the same kind of,

116
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.080
he gets to the same place,
but he,
we go going to the book,

117
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.970
they're at boot camp,

118
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.810
Marine Corps bootcamp in doc and here we go.

119
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.850
Sergeant bellow marched us to the quartermaster's.
It was there.

120
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:59.000
We stripped off all vestiges of personality.

121
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.480
It is the quarter.
So if you,
if you don't know,

122
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.050
a quarter master in the military is someone that basically run supply.

123
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.940
They'd give you gear.
That's what they are.

124
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.050
So it is the quarter masters who make soldiers,
sailors,

125
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.360
and marines in their presence.

126
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.290
One strips down with each divestment,

127
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.000
a trait is lost.

128
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.630
The discard of a garment marks the quiet death of an idiosyncrasy

129
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.180
I take off my socks.

130
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.690
Gone is a propensity for stripes or clocks or checks or even solids.

131
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.800
Ended is a tendency to combine purple socks with a brown tie.

132
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.310
My socks hence forth will be Tan.

133
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:48.110
They will neither be soiled nor rolled,
nor [inaudible] nor restrain nor holy.

134
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.090
They will be Tam.

135
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.320
The only other thing they may be is clean,

136
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.500
so it is with it all until one stands naked.

137
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.610
Struggling with an embarrassment that is entirely lost on the laconic shades who

138
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:09.060
work in the quarter.
Master sheds thus naked,

139
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.240
thus quivering on man is defenseless before the quartermaster character clings

140
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:20.721
to close that have gone into the discard as skin and hair stick to adhesive

141
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:23.760
tape.
It is torn from you.

142
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.930
Then the quartermasters shade swarm over you with measuring tape.

143
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.970
A cascade of close falls upon you,
washing you clean of personality.

144
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.510
When you have emerged from this,
you are,

145
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:41.460
but a number three five one tree niner,

146
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.820
one United States Marine Corps,

147
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.480
20 minutes before there had stood in your place,

148
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.590
a human being surrounded by some 60 other human beings.

149
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.430
But now there stood one number among 60 others,

150
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.640
the sum of all to be a training platoon.

151
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.520
But the parts have no meaning except in the context of the whole.

152
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.530
So there's a little psychological reason why they do that,
how they do it,

153
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.490
and you can see it works.
You know all those little things that you have,

154
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:19.830
all the little things that make you,
you were going to take them away.

155
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.730
That's what we're going to do.
And there's so,

156
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.720
there's this weird thing because when I went through bootcamp,

157
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.930
I wanted that take it away from me,

158
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.250
and I've said this before on the podcast,
you,
you,
it's a blank slate.

159
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:42.030
When you get,
when you go into bootcamp,
they shave your head,

160
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:44.700
they take your clothes,
they take all that personal stuff.

161
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.190
And you get a blank slate.
They tell you like,

162
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.900
this is all you need to do to succeed here.

163
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.080
All that stuff you've done in the past,
your knucklehead,
we don't care.

164
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.890
Here's what you gotta do now.
And,
and it's awesome.

165
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.300
And for a lot of people,
myself included,
you're now,

166
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.170
you're becoming part of something that's bigger than you.
That's a good feeling.

167
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.830
You know,
it's a good feeling.
I liked it.

168
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.710
I'd go so far as to say I loved it.

169
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.250
And they do the same thing.
By the way.
They do the same thing to you.

170
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:21.030
Like when you get to your seal training class,
do your buds class,

171
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.960
you get your head shaved again,
you get another set of uniforms,

172
00:11:24.961 --> 00:11:27.210
you're all gonna dress the same.
You're all going to look the same.

173
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.560
I think that head shaving thing would really do it for a lot of people.
For sure.

174
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.160
For sure.
Just cause that's some people's part,
whole personality.

175
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:37.860
You know their hair.
Dang.
They liked that hair.

176
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.350
Now,
of course,
fast forwarding a little bit,

177
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.780
but I found this interesting back to the book in six weeks of trading,

178
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:50.460
there seemed not to exist.

179
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.490
A single pattern apart from meals all seemed chaos.
Marching,

180
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:55.870
drilling and manual of arms.

181
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:58.450
Listening to lectures on military courtesy and saluting.

182
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:02.020
The right hand will strike the head at 45 degree angle midway from the right
eye,

183
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.150
listening to lectures on marine jargon from now on,
everything floor,
street,

184
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.980
ground,
everything is the deck.

185
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.120
Cleaning and polishing ones rifle until it's showing like an ornament.

186
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.350
Shaving daily,
whether Harry or beardless.
It was all a jumble.

187
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.460
What are we going to do?
Salute the jabs to death.
No,

188
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.630
we're going to blind them with spit and Polish.
Yeah,
or Barbara,
the bastards.

189
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.450
All the logic seem to be on our side.

190
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.020
The Marine Corps seemed a madness,
so they're thinking,

191
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:34.750
what are we getting out of this?
You want us to pause?

192
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:36.040
How would you teach us how to shoot the rifle?

193
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.070
<v 0>Continuing on.
It was a madness,</v>

195
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.380
but it was disciplined
apart from us.
Recruits,

196
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.160
no one in Paris island seem to care for anything but discipline.

197
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.100
There was absolutely no talk of war.

198
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:59.250
We heard no fiery lectures about killing Japs such as we were to hear later on

199
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.360
in new river,
which is a place where they go to train everything but discipline,

200
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.860
marine core discipline was steadfastly mocked and ridiculed,

201
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.100
be it holiness or high finance.

202
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.750
These drill instructors were dedicated Martin Nets like the sensualists who

203
00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:22.530
feels that if a thing cannot be eaten or drunk or taking a bed,

204
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.270
a did does not exist.
So were these Martin Nets in their outlook?

205
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.910
All was discipline.
There you go.

206
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.160
I actually,
that word struck me Martin Nets.

207
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.110
So I did a little,
you know,

208
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:44.111
I looked it up and the etymology of it is there was a French general that

209
00:13:45.381 --> 00:13:48.770
created a certain tie type of drill,

210
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.930
close order drill procedures,

211
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.490
and his name was General Jeanne Martin Net Joan Martin net.

212
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.770
So that's where he,
that's where that word comes from.

213
00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.200
And it means that you're a strict disciplinarian.

214
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.720
Wouldn't it be Martin a Martini?
I guess so for those that speak French,

215
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:11.320
French Canadian background
did not know her story.

216
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.300
Oh,
that's right.
Cause you were friends with jetty.
Jody Mitic,
you,

217
00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:17.200
you and him bonded.
We bonded over your Canadian roots.

218
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.793
Nice.

219
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.600
Another great example or a great paragraph about what this feels like back to

220
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:32.200
the book.
It is a process of surrender.
At every turn,

221
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.320
at every hour it seemed a habit or a preference had to be given up and

222
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.950
adjustment had to be made.
Even in the mess hall,

223
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:47.220
we learned that nothing mattered so little as a man's own likes or dislikes and

224
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:54.590
I think that's what is that?
That's what's so cool about,
that's what I loved,

225
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.640
right when he joined the military all,
it's all stripped away.

226
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.950
All these little comforts that you have,

227
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:05.450
they strip them away and you're left with the raw self,
right?

228
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.231
The raw self.

229
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:10.130
That's what you're left with you and you start putting everything else above

230
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:12.560
yourself.
It's a very humbling process.

231
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

232
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.120
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

233
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.120
Worst in all this process of surrender was the ruthless refusal to permit a man.

234
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.310
The slightest privacy.
Everything was done in the open,
rising,

235
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.170
waking,
writing letters,
receiving mails,
receiving mail,
making beds,

236
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.760
washing,
shaving,
combing one's hair,
emptying one's bowels,

237
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
all was done in public and shape to this style and structure of the sergeant.

238
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:47.890
So that that one right there going to the bathroom and you get to like in Navy

239
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:53.120
boot camp you,
the first time you go in the bathroom there's just toilets.

240
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.830
There's no doors,
there's no walls.
Just dissed 30 toilets in a row.

241
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.830
He prison style and you're actually prisons have,

242
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:04.010
you're only there with your little roommate.
And I even present.
So thank you.

243
00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:05.390
Sit down.
And by the way,

244
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.420
you can't say I'm going to wait until no one else is in there because they give

245
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:11.330
you,
you know,
you have to go from this to this,
to this and then,

246
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:14.420
okay we're back in the barracks.
You can go to the bathroom now.
So there you go.

247
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.480
You're going to sit down 18 inches from some other dude that's,

248
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.620
that's going to the bathroom,

249
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.680
that's emptying his bowels and there is no privacy and those,

250
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.840
I mean you may have never taken a crap in front of another human being.

251
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.460
Most people haven't.
Why would you,
so you have this,

252
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.370
you have this little sink sanctuary,
right?

253
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.090
Where are you going to get private gone?
Yeah,
it's gone.

254
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.570
All exposed.
Stripped away.
Yeah.

255
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.160
It's kind of a football is by the way thing is football and that's kind of like,

256
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:55.250
it's cool to do that.
You know,
like the coaches don't make you do that.

257
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.600
It's just like if you're shy,
you know,
or that kind of thing.

258
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:04.460
Like some guys they didn't have stalls.
They did,
but yeah,
they did.
They did.

259
00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:09.050
But the point is like it was kind of like the cool culture so guys wouldn't

260
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:12.170
close the stall.
If there was a shy guy who didn't want a shower,

261
00:17:12.171 --> 00:17:15.560
he'd go to his room and
he was like,

262
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.670
the more open and like whatever you were the cooler.
It kind of was.

263
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:24.500
But that's what it did.
Just the cohesiveness.
Yeah.
Well if you came in shy,

264
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.250
it's like you'd have that feeling,
you know?
Yeah,
but man,
I day it's true.

265
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.810
I actually remember that because I had never,
I was whatever.
I was

266
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.960
19 years old and sitting down next to a dude for the first time taking a crap.

267
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.760
I'd never done that before.
Why would you do that?
Yeah,
no.

268
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.260
You have your own little private world.
Do you have your own private space?

269
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:48.450
This is my little time.
As you know,
she's not not your

270
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.080
<v 2>back to the book.
If you are undone in Parris Island,</v>

271
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.750
which is where Marine Corps bootcamp is or where that one of them or there's

272
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:01.950
also one here in San Diego,
if you are undone in Parris Island,

273
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.510
taken apart in those first few weeks is that the rifle range that they start to

274
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:11.220
put you together again,
so that's,
and he goes into some pretty good,

275
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.600
he talks about now the rebuilding and finally in again,

276
00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:21.540
it's great details,
great information,
very cool.
Read,

277
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:23.430
very cool perspective.

278
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.760
That's why you get the book and read it back to the book.
In five weeks,

279
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.260
they had made us over another week of training remained,

280
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:37.140
but the desired change already had taken place.

281
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.990
Most important in this transformation was not the hardening of my flesh or the

282
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:46.980
sharpening of my eyes,
but the new attitude of mind.

283
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.410
I was a marine.

284
00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.240
Now that's the big transformation.
And now like I said,
they go,

285
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:05.160
they go to start their advanced training.
So in bootcamp you don't,

286
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:07.290
you're not learning,
you're learning some technical stuff,

287
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:09.720
but you're basically just learning a new attitude,
right?

288
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:12.180
You're learning to be a marine.
And then they go from there.

289
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.040
They go to a place called new river where they're going to do some more training

290
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.170
and they're going to start learning to be actual fighting marines.
So here we go,

291
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:25.170
back to the book and talking about New River here,

292
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:31.050
the only talent was that of the foot soldier,
the only tool,

293
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.770
the handgun here,
the cultivated,

294
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.980
the oblique and the delicate soon perished like Gardenias and desert.

295
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.820
So we're starting to get into some hard living and they form up into companies.

296
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:54.450
And he ends up in an h company,
second battalion,
First Marine regimen,

297
00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.100
and they get some other veterans that come to start,

298
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:06.390
help them prepare for combat.
And here's what he says about that.

299
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.630
The first,
and this is the first marine regimen,

300
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.780
the first also received a vital leavening of veteran NCOC.

301
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.140
That's noncommissioned officers.

302
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:20.670
So these are like the mid level enlisted guys that run the show.

303
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.090
They would teach us,
they would train us,

304
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.440
they would turn us into fighting troops from them.

305
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.320
We would learn our weapons from them.

306
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.320
We would take our character and temper.

307
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.260
They were the old breed and we were the new,

308
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.340
the volunteer youths who had come from the comfort of home to the hardship of

309
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:48.260
war
for the next three

310
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.920
<v 0>years.
All of these would be my comrades,</v>

311
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.650
the men of the First Marine Division.

312
00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.820
<v 0>And that's true.
They,
you know,</v>

314
00:20:58.821 --> 00:21:03.230
they always try and take veterans.

315
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.850
I shouldn't say always,

316
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.550
because actually in d day they wanted a bunch of new guys.

317
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.580
They wanted people that hadn't been in combat before.
But you know,

318
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.990
in the seal teams we do that.
Well,
I got back from Ramadi with my task unit.

319
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.690
They took my task in it,
we didn't and they split them up,

320
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.670
all put them in all different tasks,
units.

321
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.810
So we had all these guys with all the spirits go into these other tasks in.
It's,

322
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.020
this is pretty normal and that's where the true learning comes from,
right?

323
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.883
You're going to get that,

324
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:33.130
that face to face that that hands on and that true connection to what's going on

325
00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:38.540
overseas.
And here's some of the things that they did back to the book.

326
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.400
Drew Gun drill and nomenclature.
No your weapon.
Know it intimately.

327
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:47.540
Know it with almost the insight of its inventor.

328
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.410
Be able to take it apart blindfolded or in the dark to put it together.

329
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:56.570
Be able to recite mechanically a detailed description of the guns operation.
No,

330
00:21:56.571 --> 00:21:58.700
the part played by every member of the squad,

331
00:21:58.701 --> 00:22:01.220
from gunner down to the unfortunates who carried water,

332
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.880
the water can or the machine gun boxes as well as their own rifles.

333
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.190
<v 1>Okay,</v>

334
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:12.190
<v 0>so you're going to learn this weapon like better than better than the inventors.</v>

335
00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:17.840
What they're saying.
That's how well you need to know.
And you know what?

336
00:22:17.841 --> 00:22:22.400
I believe that that inventor doesn't do what these guys do with that machine
gun.

337
00:22:22.401 --> 00:22:25.520
I'll tell you if you,
if you like the guys that I,
the pig gunners,

338
00:22:25.521 --> 00:22:30.140
we call them guys that carried a mark 48 which is our big heavy weapon guys that

339
00:22:30.141 --> 00:22:33.500
carry that when you'd watch them,
it's beautiful.

340
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.330
It looks the more it's beautiful,

341
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.920
the how quick and how fast and how they combat load that thing and hit the

342
00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:44.900
ground and clear reloads.
It was like magic magic.

343
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.783
<v 1>Love that.</v>

344
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.580
<v 0>Now there's not just learning about weapons,
right?</v>

345
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.800
There's other things you gotta do.
You gotta get.

346
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.690
You still got to continue to live a hard life.

347
00:22:58.691 --> 00:23:02.620
You still got to get mentally and physically conditioned for combat and what

348
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:07.450
better way to do that?
Then some road marches,
some road marches,

349
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:12.010
which we've talked about many times here.
Back to the book.

350
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.450
A whole battalion was on the march and my poor squad was tucked away somewhere

351
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:21.190
at the center or center rear clouds of red dust settled upon us.

352
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.061
My helmet,

353
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:26.560
Bang irritably against the machine gun that was boring into my shoulder or else

354
00:23:26.561 --> 00:23:27.910
it was bumped forward.

355
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.780
Mattingly over my eyes by the movement of my pack,

356
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:36.640
mile or so out.
I dared not drink any more from my canteen.

357
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.050
I had no idea how far we had to go.
My dungarees,

358
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:45.190
we're saturated with sweat.
They're light green,
dark into by perspiration.

359
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.670
Dirt had been joking and even some singing the first mile out.

360
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.930
Now the only the bird saying,

361
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.530
but from us there was just the thud of feet,
the clank of canteens,

362
00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.570
the creak of leather rifle slings,

363
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.580
the occasional horse cracking of voice raised and breath wasted in a curse.

364
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.570
Every hour we got a 10 minute break.

365
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.420
Then came the command off and on.

366
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.370
It means off your behind and on your feet,
cursing,

367
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.790
hating both command and command.
In straining,

368
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.280
we rose to our feet and began again.

369
00:24:22.281 --> 00:24:25.520
The Dole plotting rhythm of the march

370
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.780
ye old Roadmarch

371
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.540
that's and so they're doing this type of hard training and they're going,

372
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.620
they're doing maneuvers,
they're preparing,
they're doing mock beach landings.

373
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:47.330
They're doing all those things and they're also getting some occasional liberty.

374
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.810
Do you guys know,
what do you want to liberty as as a civilian?
See,

375
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.230
it's an word that I throw out there.
Sometimes it means time off.

376
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:58.760
Liberty means time off and I don't,
it's,
it's,
it's from the navy,

377
00:24:58.761 --> 00:25:02.960
but the Marine Corps uses as well.
It means time off.

378
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.200
And so these guys,
even though they're working hard,
when boot camp,

379
00:25:06.201 --> 00:25:09.350
you don't get any liberty.
No,
you just stay in bootcamp for 13 weeks.

380
00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:12.280
You don't get any liberty in.
Once you're,
you know,

381
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.670
a fleet marine or you're in the regular navy,
you get liberty so you can go do,

382
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.500
you know,
go out and do some stuff.

383
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.150
And so these guys are going out and doing stuff.

384
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:23.930
And what do you think they're doing?
18 years old,
getting ready to go to war.

385
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.670
They're going to go out and get after it in a,
in the classic,

386
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.820
in the classic 18 year old sense of the word.
Actually.

387
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:36.140
That's when I got in that context is how I got turned onto the expression.

388
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:40.880
Get after it.
Oh from the context of of going out and partying.
Yes,
exactly.

389
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:43.910
And I don't know,
partying is what we're talking about.
That's a,

390
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:46.850
that's a term that it sounds pretty lame,
but that's what we're talking about.

391
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:51.620
I think everybody understands that term.
Drinking,
chasing girls,
partying.
That's,

392
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.670
that's what we're talking about.

393
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.360
I guess it's a commonly used term because you hear people say like,

394
00:25:56.361 --> 00:25:58.880
I remember seeing an article about some school,

395
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:02.810
some college being the number three ranked party school.

396
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:08.120
So party implies party doesn't imply birthday cake.
Hey,

397
00:26:08.121 --> 00:26:12.620
party party party implies drinking.
Getting crazy.

398
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:17.360
Yeah.
Which is different,
getting crazy different from getting nuts right now.

399
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:19.520
Getting nuts is fighting for you.
You're getting nuts.

400
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:24.260
Is Fighting Fisher in polite?
Yes.
Yes,
yes.
For sure.
All right,

401
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:27.560
so we're just talking about getting crazy and partying and that's what these

402
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:31.520
guys were doing getting after.
Yeah,
so here we go.
Back to the book.

403
00:26:31.521 --> 00:26:33.530
We were impatient.
We were wound up.

404
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.070
We could know more relaxed than we could think.
In those days.

405
00:26:37.071 --> 00:26:40.010
There was not an introspective person among us.

406
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.980
We seldom spoke of of the war,
except it might relate to

407
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.090
<v 2>ourselves and in an abstract way,
the ethics of Hitler,</v>

408
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.060
the extermination of the Jews,
the yellow peril.

409
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.590
These were matters for the gentleman of the editorial pages to discuss.

410
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.910
We lived for thrills,
not the thrills of the battlefield,

411
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:05.340
but if the speeding auto,
the dimly lighted cafe,
the drink racing,

412
00:27:05.341 --> 00:27:09.990
the blood,
the texture of a cheek,
the sheen of a silken calf,

413
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.360
nothing was permitted to last.
All had to be fluid.

414
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:19.350
We wanted not actuality but possibility.

415
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:20.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

416
00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.700
<v 2>That's pretty interesting statement.
Yeah.
We all had to be food we wanted,</v>

417
00:27:24.701 --> 00:27:28.010
not actually,
they don't actually want that.
They wanted to chase that.
Right,

418
00:27:28.011 --> 00:27:32.440
right.
The chief,
we could not be still always movement.

419
00:27:32.441 --> 00:27:33.520
Everything changing.

420
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:38.790
We were like shadows fleeing ever fleeing condemned men.

421
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.160
Souls in hell.

422
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:43.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

423
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.740
<v 2>Soon the spate of 62 our liberties was ended mid May of 1942 saw me go home for</v>

424
00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:50.970
the last time.

425
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:56.270
My family would not set eyes on me again for nearly three years.

426
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:01.563
<v 1>Okay.</v>

427
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.020
<v 2>And again,</v>

428
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.730
obviously there's some very important experiences in that section.

429
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

430
00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.800
<v 2>That's why you read the book.
Great.</v>

431
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.880
It's great to hear his perspective.
You're gonna see,
uh,
Robert Lucky.

432
00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.920
He's a very,
he's a very intelligent and he became a writer.

433
00:28:23.921 --> 00:28:24.850
I mean he became a writer.
He,

434
00:28:24.851 --> 00:28:27.730
this isn't the only book I think he wrote 40 plus books in his life.

435
00:28:27.731 --> 00:28:30.940
He worked for big newspapers and he's a,
he's a writer,

436
00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:34.360
so he's a very smart guy.
And,

437
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.300
and he talks about that and we'll get to that point in here,
but hit,

438
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.130
that's why his perspective is so interesting.

439
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.580
And he brings a lot of that in this book.

440
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:45.960
But eventually,

441
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:51.470
obviously they finish their training no more partying and now it's time to fight

442
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.133
back to the book.

443
00:28:55.530 --> 00:29:00.530
Fires flickered on the shores of Guadalcanal island when we came on the deck.

444
00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:02.660
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

445
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.500
<v 2>they were not great flaming leaping fires and we were disappointed.</v>

446
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.190
We had expected to see the world a light.
When we emerged from the hatches,

447
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.260
the bombardment had seemed fierce.
Our,

448
00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.930
our odd armada for such,
we judged it to be,

449
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.440
seemed capable of blasting Guadalcanal into production.

450
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.060
But in the dirty don't of August 7th,

451
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:30.530
1942 there were only a few fires flickering like the city dumps to light our

452
00:29:30.531 --> 00:29:31.880
path to history.

453
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

454
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.070
<v 2>We were apprehensive,
not frightened.</v>

455
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.640
So in case you haven't gathered,

456
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.880
these guys are about to the landing at Guadalcanal

457
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.310
and they get into the,

458
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.810
the little Higgins boats,
the little landing craft,
and here we go.

459
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:57.340
The assault began.
Now I was praying again.
I had prayed much the night before,

460
00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.070
carefully,
deliberately in,
in,

461
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.910
in betraying God and the Virgin to care for my family and friends.

462
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:08.530
Should I fall in the vanity of youth?
I was positive.

463
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.860
I would die in the same vanity.

464
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.100
I was turning my affairs over to the Almighty.

465
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.390
<v 3>Okay.</v>

466
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:21.710
<v 2>And I think what he means by vanity that he was sure he would die.
You'd Think,</v>

467
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.660
oh,
somebody that's vein will be like,
Hey,
I can't be killed.

468
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.640
But I think what he means by that is the vanity.

469
00:30:28.641 --> 00:30:31.370
That there's some determined outcome that,

470
00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:35.310
that you can control or that there's that it's that there's some way it's going

471
00:30:35.311 --> 00:30:39.660
to go right,
like he's going to die.
No,
you don't even know that.
Right,
right.

472
00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:42.740
It's that he knows,
you know.
I know.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
exactly.

473
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.330
I know what's going to happen.
I know I'm going to die.

474
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.640
That's vanity in its own right.
That's what he's saying.

475
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.110
So they hit the landing back to the book,
but there was no fight.

476
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:59.190
The Japanese had run from somewhere came the command move out.

477
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.730
We formed staggered squads and slogged off.

478
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.700
We left our innocence on Red Beach.
It would never be the same.

479
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.323
<v 3>Okay.</v>

480
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.400
<v 2>They spend a night there,
there,</v>

481
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:23.430
there now patrolling in and in the night there there Ian security positions and

482
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:27.550
they hear a little gunfire and we'll go to the book.
At dawn,

483
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:31.840
we learned the import of the gunfire.
Uh,
medical corpsman had been killed.

484
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:36.580
He had been shot by his own men when the century had challenged him.

485
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:41.020
As you returned from relieving himself,
he had boggled over the password.

486
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.740
Lilliputian
and so met death.

487
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.780
It turned a d at The mercy of a liquid consonant.

488
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.143
Now,

489
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:57.210
little heads up Lilliputian is not a good challenge and reply password for

490
00:31:57.941 --> 00:31:58.450
everyone.

491
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.200
You don't want me want me to come up with something that's not totally obvious,

492
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.890
but don't make a guy that's scared out in the middle of the jungle.

493
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.630
Remember the word Lilliputian.

494
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.853
<v 3>Okay.</v>

495
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.340
<v 2>And,
and you know we talk about blue on blue.
There you go.</v>

496
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.910
Like their first casualty is blue on blue.
Their first casualty is blue on blue.

497
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.700
Their first casualty is that got uh,
uh,

498
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.490
medical corpsman being killed by centuries.
That's a nightmare.

499
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.240
<v 3>Hmm.
And</v>

500
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.380
<v 2>I wasn't going to read this,
but I'm going to,
I peered at the captain.</v>

501
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:36.270
Anxiety was on his face as though carve there by the night's events.

502
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.000
It startled me.
Here was no warrior,
no veteran of a hundred battles.

503
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.870
He was only a civilian like myself.
He was a man,

504
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.730
hardly more confident than the trigger.

505
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:50.960
Happy Century who had killed the corpsman.
He was much older than I,

506
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.150
but the responsibility of his charge,

507
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:58.100
the unknown face of war had frightened him pass trusting the evidence of his

508
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:02.510
senses.
So imagine you're going into combat,
you're in charge,

509
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:03.344
you're civilian,

510
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.620
but now you're in charge and you're going out on your first combat patrol.

511
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:08.490
You lay up and your first thing you do is you kill when you're on you.

512
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.250
One of your own guys kills one of your other guys.

513
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:11.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

514
00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.550
<v 2>It's a nightmare.
And he can see it on his face.</v>

515
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.613
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

516
00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:22.900
<v 2>They spend the rest of the day out there.
Still no heavy enemy contact.</v>

517
00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:27.370
Back to the book.
That day was a dull last witness to the cycle.

518
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:31.150
The son of which I have neither memory,
no regret.

519
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.030
The night I shall never forget.

520
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.680
I awoke in the middle of it to see the sky on fire.
So it seemed,

521
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.270
it was like the red mist of my childhood dream when I imagined judgment to have

522
00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:46.600
calm while I played baseball on the castle grounds at home,

523
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.100
we were bathed in red light as though fixed in the eye of Satan.

524
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.920
Imagine a myriad of red traffic lights glowing in the rain and you will have a

525
00:33:56.921 --> 00:33:59.590
replica of the world in which I awoke.

526
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.770
The lights were the flares of the enemy.

527
00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.090
They hung above the jungle roof swing gently on their parachutes,

528
00:34:07.091 --> 00:34:11.380
casting their red glow about motors.
Throbbed above.

529
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.710
They were those of Japanese sea planes.
We learned later.

530
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.690
We thought they were hunting us,

531
00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.800
but they were actually the eyes of a mighty enemy.

532
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.610
Naval Armada that's swept into c Clark channel.

533
00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:30.420
Soon we heard the sound of cannons and they island trembled beneath us.

534
00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.740
There came flashes of light white and red and great rocking explosions.

535
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.440
The Japs were hammering out one of their greatest naval victories.

536
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.230
It was the battle of salvo island.

537
00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:49.060
What we learned to call more accurately the battle of four sitting ducks.

538
00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.450
They were sinking.
Three American cruisers,

539
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:57.310
the Quincy vinsons and a Storia and one Australian cruiser,

540
00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.593
the Canberra,

541
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:05.610
as well as damaging one other American cruiser and a US destroyer.

542
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.020
<v 3>Okay,</v>

543
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.470
<v 2>and so they then,
during this they move towards the beach</v>

544
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.470
and here we go.
It was dusk.
When we reached the beach,

545
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.080
we saw a wrecked and smoking ships,

546
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:24.230
a clean on shipped expanse of water between Guadalcanal and Florida island.

547
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.830
Our Navy was gone.
Gone.

548
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:30.700
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

549
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.533
<v 2>so</v>

550
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.340
if you don't know anything about the Pacific campaign,

551
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.160
you're taking down islands

552
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:42.840
<v 0>and your lifeline is the navy because that's who's going to bring you
ammunition,</v>

553
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.470
food,
water,
gun support,
fire support.

554
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.780
That's where you're going to take your casualties.

555
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.290
So you have total reliance on the navy.

556
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.120
And these guys wake up in the morning and the Navy's gone other than sunken

557
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:57.954
ships.

558
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.330
Horrible.
And what can they do?
There's nowhere to run to.

559
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.600
You can't back.
We can't.
There's nowhere to go.
But Navy is gone.

560
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:16.550
So they get ordered to take a position where they think an attack might come

561
00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:21.810
from.
And here we go.
Back to the book,
we were ordered up from the beach,

562
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:24.960
two new positions on the West Bank of the tenor rule river.

563
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.740
Our orders commanded us to urgency.

564
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.560
The enemy was expected.

565
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:37.910
The 10 rule river laid green and evil like a serpent across the palm.

566
00:36:38.151 --> 00:36:40.920
He coastal plain,
it was called a river,

567
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:45.630
but it was not a river like most of the streams of Oceana.
It was a creek,

568
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.310
not 30 yards wide.

569
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.760
So they're placed there to set security and they're there for a while.

570
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:58.340
And finally one night here we go back to the book a man says of the eruption of

571
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:04.920
battle,
all hell broke loose the first time he says it.

572
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:09.840
It is true,
wonderfully descriptive.
The millionth time.

573
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:13.140
It has said it has been worn into meaninglessness.

574
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:18.690
It has gone the way of all good phrasing.
It has become cliche,

575
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.500
but within five minutes of that first machine gun burst of the appearance of

576
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:30.150
that first enemy flare that suffused the battlefield and honestly Greenough

577
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:35.220
greenish light and by its dying accentuated the redeveloping night.

578
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.780
Within five minutes of this,
all hell broke loose.

579
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.860
Everyone was firing.
Every weapon was sounding voice,

580
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.480
but this was no orchestration,
no terribly beautiful symphony,

581
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.050
symphony of death as decadent rear echelon observers,

582
00:37:52.051 --> 00:37:56.310
right here was a cacophony.
Here was a cacophony.

583
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.550
Here was dissonance.
Here was wildness.

584
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:04.530
He was the absence of rhythm,
the loss of limit for fires.

585
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.893
What?

586
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:11.990
When and where he chooses here was booming sounding,

587
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:17.280
shrinking,
wailing,
hissing,
crashing,
shaking,

588
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.830
jibberish noise here was hell.

589
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Yet each weapon had its own sound and it is odd with what clarity.

590
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:32.130
The trained ear distinguishes each one and catalogs it plucks it out of the

591
00:38:32.131 --> 00:38:33.060
genital din.

592
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:37.690
Even though it is intermingled with coincidental with the voice of a dozen

593
00:38:37.691 --> 00:38:38.524
others,

594
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:44.100
even though one's own machine guns spits and coughs and dances and shakes and

595
00:38:44.501 --> 00:38:45.970
cleric fury.

596
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:52.230
So it was that our ears pricked prickled at strange new sounds,

597
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.610
the lighter shingles snapping crack of the Japanese rifle,

598
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.850
the gargle of,
they're extremely fast machine guns,

599
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.670
the hiccup of their light mortars.

600
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.050
And by the way,
the movie the Pacific or the,

601
00:39:10.051 --> 00:39:13.590
the series that Pacific shows the battle scenes of the tender we river and

602
00:39:13.591 --> 00:39:14.424
they're phenomenal.

603
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:18.780
They do a great job of representing what's just what he's talking about right

604
00:39:18.781 --> 00:39:23.310
there.
Back to the book,
we dive for our,
our holes and gun positions.

605
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.600
I jumped the gun,

606
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:29.930
I jumped the gun with which chocolate and I had left standing on the bank.

607
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:34.620
I unclamp the gun and fired spraying my shots as though air handling a hose.

608
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.330
All but one fell.

609
00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.600
The first fell as though his underpart had been cut from him by a Skype and the

610
00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:46.500
others fell tumbling,
screaming.
Once again,

611
00:39:46.501 --> 00:39:50.490
our gun collapsed and I grabbed a rifle.
I remember it had no sling,

612
00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:55.130
which had been left near the gun.
The jap who had survived,

613
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.270
who had survived was deep into the coconuts.

614
00:39:57.271 --> 00:39:59.370
By the time I found him in the rifle sites,

615
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:05.370
there was his back bobbing large and he seemed to be throwing his pack away.

616
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.940
Then I fired and he wasn't there anymore.

617
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.000
Perhaps it was not I who shot him,

618
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.210
but everyone had found their senses for,

619
00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:18.150
not everyone had found their senses and their weapons by then,

620
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.210
but I boasted that I had perhaps too,

621
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:26.520
it was a merciful bullet that pounded him between the shoulder blades for,

622
00:40:26.521 --> 00:40:31.521
he was fleeing to a certain and horrible end Black Knights hunger and slow

623
00:40:33.691 --> 00:40:38.460
dissolution in the rain forest,
but I had not thought of mercy.

624
00:40:38.461 --> 00:40:42.750
Then modern war went forward in the jungle.

625
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.850
Men of the first battalion were cleaning up.

626
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.000
Sometimes they drove a Japanese toward us.

627
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.370
He would cower on the river bank,

628
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:55.550
hiding on aware that opposite him where we already the victors.

629
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.580
Numerous,
heavily armed.
Lusting for more blood.

630
00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:00.970
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

631
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.650
<v 0>We killed a few more this way.</v>

632
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.070
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

633
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.140
<v 0>the fever was on us</v>

634
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:11.500
yet.

635
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:16.500
It's interesting in that he's looking back and thinking to himself that when he

636
00:41:16.521 --> 00:41:18.650
kills this Japanese soldier,

637
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.850
that that was a merciful thing to do because he,
they've been suffered yet.

638
00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.120
They've been on the island for a few days,
even though they're scared,

639
00:41:26.121 --> 00:41:27.110
even though they receive fire,

640
00:41:27.111 --> 00:41:30.350
they haven't gone to the full length of suffering that they're going to go

641
00:41:30.351 --> 00:41:33.800
through.
So when the over

642
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.760
<v 2>and Leckie gives everyone in the book,</v>

643
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:43.420
he just gives them these really kind of easy to understand nicknames based on

644
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.230
their personality.

645
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.870
So he talks about this guy here who he calls Lieutenant Ivy League,

646
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:54.770
which doesn't take a lot of explanation to picture what that guy is like.

647
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:58.880
So here we go back to the book Lieutenant Ivy League strode up to our pits in

648
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:01.460
the morning.
So this is the battle's over.

649
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.880
He sat on a coconut log and told us what had happened.

650
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.870
He smoked desperately and stared into the river.
As he talked,

651
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:13.820
the skin around his eyes was drawn tight with strain and with shock.

652
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:19.220
His eyes had already taken on that aspect.
Peculiar to Guadalcanal,

653
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:24.020
that constant stare of pupils that seemed darker,
larger,

654
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.450
rounder,
more.
Absolutely.

655
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:28.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

656
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.710
<v 2>Did he kind of gives them a debrief on what happened with the battle that where</v>

657
00:42:32.711 --> 00:42:36.760
the Japanese had come from and then he says,
when he spoke again,

658
00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.460
it was to tell us who had been killed.

659
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.480
There were more than a dozen from age company besides more than a score of

660
00:42:46.151 --> 00:42:50.260
wounded.
Four or five of the dead were from our platoon.

661
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.770
Tune with them had been hacked to death.

662
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:59.020
A Japanese scouting party had found them asleep in their whole on the river bank

663
00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.320
and slice them into pieces.

664
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:04.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

665
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.930
<v 2>Our regimen had killed something like 900 of them.</v>

666
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:13.840
Most of them lay in clusters or an heaps before the gun pits,

667
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.520
commanding the sand spit as though they had not died singly,

668
00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.080
but in groups,

669
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:26.140
one of the Marines went methodically among the dead.
Armed with a pair of pliers.

670
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:30.610
He had observed that the Japanese have a penchant for gold fillings in their

671
00:43:30.611 --> 00:43:35.200
teeth,
often for solid gold teeth.
He was looting.

672
00:43:35.201 --> 00:43:39.040
They're very mouth's.
He would kick their jaws,

673
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:44.050
agape peer into the mouth with all the solicitude of a park avenue dentist.

674
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.040
Careful,

675
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.040
always careful not to contaminate himself by touch and Yank out all the

676
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:55.110
glittered you kept the gold teeth and an empty bull.

677
00:43:55.111 --> 00:43:58.370
Durham Tobacco Sac,
which he wore around his neck.

678
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:00.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

679
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.500
<v 2>Souvenirs,
we called him.
That's another nickname he gives.
They get,</v>

680
00:44:04.501 --> 00:44:05.850
they called this guy souvenirs.

681
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.380
Now
they're holding in that position and,

682
00:44:13.381 --> 00:44:17.100
and for a few nights while they were holding this position on the river,

683
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.350
they would see,
they didn't know what it was.

684
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.130
They would see sort of a v in the calm water.

685
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.760
They would see like a v a disturbance in the water and they couldn't figure out

686
00:44:26.761 --> 00:44:29.370
what it was.
They were scared out of the couple of times they shot towards it.

687
00:44:29.371 --> 00:44:32.630
They didn't know what it was.
I thought it was a spy or,
or uh,

688
00:44:32.631 --> 00:44:37.080
a scout trying to check them out,
but they were crocodiles.

689
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

690
00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.061
<v 2>Back to the book.</v>

691
00:44:40.061 --> 00:44:44.100
I took the glasses from him and focused on the opposite shore where I saw a

692
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:47.110
crocodile eating the fat Japanese.

693
00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.770
I watched and debased fascination.

694
00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.710
But when the crocodile began to tug the intestines,

695
00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.180
I recalled my own presence in that very river hardly an hour ago,

696
00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:03.330
and my knees went weak and I relinquished the glasses that night.

697
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.770
The v reappeared in the wherever,

698
00:45:05.771 --> 00:45:10.330
so they could see that the little ripple in the river or everyone whooped and

699
00:45:10.331 --> 00:45:14.290
hollered,
no one fired.
We knew what it was.

700
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:19.210
It was the crocodile three smaller V's trailed afterwards,

701
00:45:19.211 --> 00:45:24.160
so there's even more crocodiles coming.
They kept us awake,

702
00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.970
crunching the smell kept us awake.

703
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:31.990
Even though we lay with our heads swath and a blanket,
which was now,

704
00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:36.700
which was how he kept off the mosquitoes.
The smell overpowered us,

705
00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.840
smell the sense which somehow seems a joke is the one most susceptible to

706
00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:47.500
outrage.
It will give you no rest.

707
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:52.780
One can close one's eyes to ugliness or shields the ears from sound,

708
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.550
but from a powerful smell,

709
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.530
there is no recourse but flight than since we could not flee,

710
00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:03.370
we could not escape this smell and we could not sleep.

711
00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.030
We never fired at the crocodiles.

712
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:12.210
They return to the repast day after day until the remains were removed to mass

713
00:46:12.701 --> 00:46:17.320
burning and burial,
which served as a funeral pyre for the enemy.

714
00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:18.930
We had denial dated

715
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.790
our victory in the fight,
which we called.

716
00:46:28.791 --> 00:46:33.020
The Battle of Hell's point was not so great as we had imagined it to be.

717
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.430
It was to be,
but one of the many fights for Guadalcanal and in the end,

718
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:43.330
not the foremost of them,
but being the first in our experience,

719
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:48.570
we took it for total triumph like those who take the present for the best of all

720
00:46:49.361 --> 00:46:53.770
worlds,
having no reference to the past nor regard for the future.

721
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.310
<v 1>Okay?</v>

722
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:57.600
<v 2>It's a mistake we all make.</v>

723
00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.830
You know something good happens and you think you think you're the victor

724
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:06.390
[inaudible] from the high plateau of triumph.

725
00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:10.440
We were about to descend into the depths of trial and tedium.

726
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.270
The Japanese attack was to be redoubled and prolonged in varied.

727
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:18.120
It would come from the sky,
the sea,
and the land.

728
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.490
In between every trial there would stretch out the tedium that sucks.

729
00:47:23.491 --> 00:47:28.491
A man dry drawing off the juice from body and soul as a native removes the

730
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.600
contents of a stick of sugar cane leaving.

731
00:47:31.601 --> 00:47:35.560
It spent cracked good for nothing but the flames.

732
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:42.790
And there is terror coming from the interaction of trial and tedium,

733
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:50.150
the first shaking a and as the wind and the tree tops the second eroding him as

734
00:47:51.961 --> 00:47:55.620
the flood at the roots.
So he's got these two things that are working on him.

735
00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:01.830
Trial,
which is the,
the actual fighting,
the actual attacks and tedium,

736
00:48:01.831 --> 00:48:05.850
which is the boredom and the waiting.
And again,

737
00:48:05.851 --> 00:48:10.380
if you watch the Pacific,
it does a great job of showing this in.

738
00:48:10.381 --> 00:48:14.040
One of the things that really got me when I watched that for the first time is

739
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.290
it shows this landing and there's nothing happening.

740
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.310
Then you're waiting for it to happen.
The new,

741
00:48:19.311 --> 00:48:23.370
you know what's going to happen and you're waiting for it.
And that was a real,

742
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:24.600
that that,

743
00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:29.550
that I remember that feeling of being in the streets and you're waiting for to

744
00:48:29.551 --> 00:48:31.800
happen and you're just waiting and it's a,

745
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:36.720
you want it to happen because then you can go,
let's get it over with.

746
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:41.460
Yeah,
but here's what he's describing it as like a tree being eroded.

747
00:48:41.461 --> 00:48:46.461
So the first shaking a man as the wind in the tree tops the second.

748
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.120
So that's,
that's what,
that's what the,
the actual thing does to chase you around.

749
00:48:51.121 --> 00:48:54.000
But the tedium,
the second,

750
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:58.230
that's the tedium eroding him as the flood at the roots.

751
00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:03.090
Each fresh trial leaves a man more shaken than the last and each period of

752
00:49:03.091 --> 00:49:06.930
tedium with it's time for speculative dread

753
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.650
leaves.
His foundations worn lower,

754
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.620
his woots less from for the next trial.

755
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.060
Sometimes there is a final shattering.

756
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:24.300
A man crouching in a pit beneath the bombardment of a battleship might put a

757
00:49:25.571 --> 00:49:29.020
pistol to his head and deliver himself.

758
00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:31.690
Sometimes it is partial,

759
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:37.280
but another man might break at the sound of a diving enemy plane and scream and

760
00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:41.650
shutter and wring his hands and rise to run.

761
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.630
This is the terror I meant.
This is the terror,

762
00:49:46.631 --> 00:49:51.040
that strangles reason with the clawing hands of panic.

763
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.410
I saw it twice.
I felt it pluck at me twice,
but it was rare.

764
00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.490
It claimed few victims,
so,

765
00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:02.840
so that's a really,

766
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:08.230
I think that's just a phenomenal way to understand what these guys were going

767
00:50:08.901 --> 00:50:09.734
through.

768
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:15.230
The waiting and then the trial and then the waiting and then the trial.

769
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.910
And that's a great description.
Speculative,
dread.

770
00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:24.290
Just just thinking about,
okay,
what's the next attack going to be like?

771
00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:25.850
Are we going to be able to get through it?

772
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.760
<v 4>Okay.</v>

773
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.170
<v 2>And you know,
he's talking about guys killed themselves.
Yeah.</v>

774
00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:34.150
Being so they just can't take it any more.

775
00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.760
They can't take it anymore and

776
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:39.390
<v 4>okay.</v>

777
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:43.830
<v 2>The only way out they can figure is to kill themselves,
which is just,</v>

778
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:48.180
it's horrible,
horrible,
thick love times criminals will do that.

779
00:50:48.181 --> 00:50:51.370
Like if they're on there,
like fugitive,
if they're on the run crew.
Yeah.

780
00:50:51.371 --> 00:50:55.010
And they're like,
when are they going to break down my door and find me?

781
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:58.860
And they get that speculative dread and they just turned themselves in.
Right.

782
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:02.640
Or I thought you were going to say that sometimes,
you know guys wants,

783
00:51:02.641 --> 00:51:05.640
they're surrounded by the Swat team.
Oh yeah,
that happens.
Then there's just no,

784
00:51:05.641 --> 00:51:08.130
there's,
they just can't take any more of that give themselves,
yeah,

785
00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:09.720
I feel like that's more of them.

786
00:51:09.721 --> 00:51:12.330
Like I'd rather die than go to jail almost sure thing.

787
00:51:12.331 --> 00:51:15.120
But true speculative tread there.
You're talking about it.
Yeah.

788
00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:16.640
Even in like did you the tournaments,

789
00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.740
you know when you're winning around like Oh am I up,
am I up?

790
00:51:19.741 --> 00:51:22.510
That's like can be part of the chat.
I mean waiting.
Yeah.

791
00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.810
I mean obviously way more lighthearted than this,

792
00:51:24.811 --> 00:51:28.440
but you know this and he,

793
00:51:28.441 --> 00:51:31.620
so he says this and he says it,
he claimed few victims,

794
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:36.090
meaning it didn't actually,
most guys sucked it up and you're going to hear him.

795
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.530
You know,
cause he says he felt it.
Yeah.
Twice.
It plucked at him twice

796
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.250
but it wasn't,
it was rare.
He says it but it was rare.

797
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:49.460
And then he says courage was commonplace.

798
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:50.260
<v 4>Okay.</v>

799
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.300
<v 2>Cause that was what was normal.
What was normal was courage.</v>

800
00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:59.510
And this is just such a good paragraph or two here.
Courage was,

801
00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:01.030
was a commonplace.

802
00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:06.420
It formed a club or corporation much as do those other common things upon which

803
00:52:08.381 --> 00:52:12.430
men for diverse reasons place so great.
A value like money,

804
00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.770
like charity four,

805
00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:19.940
it is in the common on which the exclusive rests.

806
00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:21.260
<v 4>Okay</v>

807
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.400
<v 2>are muddy machine.</v>

808
00:52:22.401 --> 00:52:27.401
Gun Pits were transformed into courage clubs when bombs fell or Japanese

809
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:31.160
warships pounded us from the sea.

810
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:36.960
There was protocol to be observed too and it was natural that the poor fellow

811
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:42.540
who might break into momentary terror should cause pain silences and embarrassed

812
00:52:43.901 --> 00:52:46.810
coughs.
Everyone looked the other way,

813
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:52.260
like millionaires confronted by the horrifying sight of a club member borrowing

814
00:52:53.231 --> 00:52:54.940
$5 from the waiter.

815
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:56.600
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

816
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.710
<v 2>and then he says this,</v>

817
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:01.670
but there was a bit more charity in our clubs I think.

818
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:02.670
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

819
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:07.670
<v 2>We were not quite so puffed up that we could not recognize the ugly thing on our</v>

820
00:53:08.881 --> 00:53:11.850
friend's face as the elder brother.

821
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:12.940
<v 4>Okay.</v>

822
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:17.180
<v 2>Of the thing fluttering within our own inner.</v>

823
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:18.860
<v 4>Okay,</v>

824
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.920
<v 2>you today?
Me Tomorrow.</v>

825
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:23.833
<v 4>Okay.</v>

826
00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:26.610
<v 2>And such a powerful</v>

827
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:31.610
<v 0>thing to think about when you see someone going through some trouble to be able</v>

828
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:33.930
to recognize like,
hey guys,
you know,

829
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.190
Echo's going through some issues right now and I'm not looking down at you.

830
00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:40.260
I'm not judging you.

831
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:44.970
I'm recognizing that what you're going through today could be what I go through

832
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:47.640
tomorrow.
And they all felt,
he felt that,
you know,

833
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:52.020
I see echo losing it and curling into a ball and not wanting to fight.

834
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:57.420
And I recognize that as the older brother of the thing that I actually feel too.

835
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:00.900
But I've got it under control today.
Tomorrow I might not,

836
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:05.040
but today I got under control.
That's why I'm not looking down my nose at you.

837
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:06.390
And that's why I'm not judging you.

838
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:11.370
And I think that forms such a tight bond that these guys had,

839
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:12.570
you know,

840
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:17.570
these guys had respect enough respect and enough mercy on each other to say,

841
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:22.230
look,
echoes goes having a hard time right now.
It's okay,

842
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.760
we're going to get him through today.

843
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:28.650
I'm not going to look down on him in tomorrow.
It might be me.

844
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:31.980
And he's not going to look down on me.
Yeah.
Powerful stuff.

845
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:36.420
We tend to judge.
Yeah.
Especially,
yeah,

846
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:38.810
it seems like they so they can relate,
you know,

847
00:54:38.811 --> 00:54:42.900
like echoes at level eight right now.
He's losing it.
I'm over here at level two.

848
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.560
Yep.
And Luckily I can keep the two inside,
you know?
Yeah.

849
00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.530
But I don't even know when two's going to be four tables at one,

850
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.010
so I could very well be it,
you know?

851
00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:56.610
But then why idea that when you're dealing with other people you try and have

852
00:54:57.451 --> 00:54:58.141
their perspective.

853
00:54:58.141 --> 00:55:01.440
You try and take their perspective and understand what they're going through and

854
00:55:01.441 --> 00:55:05.510
have empathy for what's happening to them.
Powerful.
Yeah,
man.

855
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.610
Instead we tend so often just did want to judge.

856
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:09.683
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

857
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.093
Judge,

858
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.470
<v 0>back to the book at night washing machine,</v>

859
00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:24.240
Charlie picked up the slack washing machine,
washing machine.

860
00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:29.241
Charlie so named for the sound of his motors was the nocturnal marauder who

861
00:55:29.821 --> 00:55:33.330
proud our skies.
So these are Japanese bombers,

862
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:38.200
like the dog who's bark is worse than its bite.

863
00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:42.820
The throb of Charlie's motors was more fearsome than thump of his bombs.

864
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:48.430
Charlie did not kill many people,
but like Macbeth,

865
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:54.150
he murdered sleep to these trials was added the worst ordeal,

866
00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:59.140
shelling from the sea enemy warships,
usually cruisers.

867
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.380
Sometimes battleships stand off your coast.

868
00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.490
It is night and you cannot see them,
nor could you.

869
00:56:06.491 --> 00:56:09.670
If it were day as they're miles and miles away,

870
00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.530
we could see the flashes of the guns far out to sea.

871
00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:19.330
We heard the soft papoose,
a boom of their salvos.

872
00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.740
Then rushing through the night,
straining an airy

873
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:26.890
<v 2>boxcar came the huge projectiles,</v>

874
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:32.170
the earth rocks and shakes upon the terrifying crash of the detonation.

875
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.420
Though it'd be hundreds of yards away.

876
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.140
Your stomach is squeezed as though a monster,

877
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:43.120
a monster hand.
We're needing it into dough.
You,

878
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:44.590
Greg,
gasp for breath.

879
00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:48.550
Like a football player who falls heavily and as the wind knocked out of him,

880
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:54.230
flash,
boom,
they're lowing their sites.

881
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:57.920
It's coming closer.
Oh,
that one was close.
The sandbags are falling.

882
00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:01.100
I can't hear it.
I can't hear the shell.
It's the one you don't hear.

883
00:57:01.101 --> 00:57:05.890
They say the one you don't hear.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Flash pop boob.

884
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:11.060
Thank God it's lifted.
It's going the other way.

885
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:17.890
It's daylight now and they're only the bombings to worry about and the heat and

886
00:57:18.411 --> 00:57:23.360
the mosquitoes and the rice line in our bellies like stones.

887
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:29.770
So again,

888
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:34.830
the the unknown and uncontrollable experience of getting hit with mortars or

889
00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:39.700
artillery or in this case naval gunfire.
And again,

890
00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:43.660
there's no u US navy out there.
They're just having their way.
It's a nightmare.

891
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:52.180
They continue to press on,
but things are not looking good.
Back to the book,

892
00:57:52.181 --> 00:57:53.050
everyone kept saying,

893
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:56.440
hopefully that the army was coming in next week to relieve us.

894
00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:59.110
Everyone was in despair.

895
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:05.160
We heard that the army relief force had been destroyed at see chocolate and I

896
00:58:06.011 --> 00:58:07.270
visited the cemetery.

897
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:12.640
It laid to the south off the coastal road that ran from east to west through the

898
00:58:12.641 --> 00:58:16.770
coconuts.
We knelt to pray before the graves of the men.

899
00:58:16.771 --> 00:58:21.150
We had known only palm fronds marked a place where they were buried,

900
00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.111
although here,

901
00:58:22.111 --> 00:58:26.880
and there were rude crosses on which were nailed.

902
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:31.890
The men's identification tags,
some of the crosses,

903
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.480
Bor mess gear,
tins of fixed to the wood,

904
00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:41.570
like rude medallions and on those the marines had lovingly carved they're

905
00:58:42.091 --> 00:58:42.930
epitaphs.

906
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:48.500
He died fighting a real marine,

907
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:54.690
a big guy with a bigger heart.
Our buddy,

908
00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:01.000
the harder the going,
the morph cheerful he was.

909
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:09.060
There was also this verse which I had seen countless times before and since the

910
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:12.880
direct and unpolished cry of a marine,

911
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:16.900
sardonic heart and when he gets to heaven,

912
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.950
so Saint Peter,
he will tell one more marine reporting,
sir,

913
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.650
I've served my time and hell

914
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:31.633
<v 3>yeah.</v>

915
00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:34.360
<v 2>Now part of that,
part of that,</v>

916
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.823
<v 3>okay,</v>

917
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:43.500
<v 2>despair that they felt came from the fact that they began to feel</v>

918
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.900
expendable.
Then he goes into that.

919
00:59:49.901 --> 00:59:54.901
Here all armies have expendable items that is a part or unit the destruction of

920
00:59:55.991 --> 00:59:59.230
which will not be fatal to the whole in some more deals,

921
00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:04.240
a man might consider his finger expendable,
but not his hand or extremity.

922
01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:06.490
His arm,
but not as hard.

923
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:11.710
There are expendable items which may be lost or destroyed in the field,

924
01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:16.450
either in war or peace without their owner being required to replace them.

925
01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:21.160
A rifle is so expendable or a cartridge belt.

926
01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:23.590
So are men.

927
01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:29.530
Men are the most expendable of all hunger.
The jungle,

928
01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:31.840
the Japanese,
not one,

929
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:36.900
nor all of these could be quite as corrosive as the feeling of expandability.

930
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:45.270
This was no feeling of dedication because it was absolutely involuntary.

931
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:51.370
I do not doubt Betty for marines had asked for volunteers for an impossible

932
01:00:51.371 --> 01:00:54.040
campaigns such as Guadalcanal,
almost everyone.

933
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:58.750
Now fighting would've stepped forward.
But that is sacrifice.

934
01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:03.810
That is voluntary being expended robs you of that x saltation the self

935
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:14.190
abnegation the absolute freedom of self sacrifice being expended puts one in the

936
01:01:16.511 --> 01:01:19.810
role of victim rather than sacrifice her.

937
01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:24.760
And there was always something begrudging in this.

938
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.173
So

939
01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:31.240
<v 3>yeah,</v>

940
01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:34.570
<v 2>luckily they do end up</v>

941
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.530
getting some help,
getting relieved.

942
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:43.040
The army shows up to help him out and here we go.

943
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:47.780
So we were glad to see the soldiers when they came trudging up to our pits.

944
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.750
They came after another air rate,
a very close one.

945
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:54.410
But the thing had not infected them yet.

946
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.810
War was still a lark.

947
01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.970
Their faces were still heavy with flesh.
Their ribs padded,

948
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:03.800
their eyes innocent.

949
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:09.700
They were older than we an averaged 25 to our average 20 yet we treated them

950
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.823
like children.

951
01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:18.820
Now even though they get relieved,

952
01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:23.850
they're working and still fighting and they're still suffering.

953
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:30.510
Back to the book we were growing erodible our strength was being steadily sapped

954
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:34.230
and a sort of physical depression afflicted.
Many of us.

955
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:35.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

956
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:39.990
<v 2>The rain,
the rainy season was upon us on our exposed rich.</v>

957
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.830
It fell upon us and Torrance,
a man was drenched in seconds.

958
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:48.030
His teeth chattering in his hands darting swiftly to his precious cigarettes,

959
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.400
transferring them to the safety of his helmet liner,

960
01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:53.970
cursing bitterly if he'd waited too long before becoming conscious of their

961
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.790
peril.
After cigarettes,

962
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.470
we were concerned about our ammunition on the downward slope of the hill.

963
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.850
The rain water ran into our pits and holes as though they were sewer receivers.

964
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:10.500
We had to dash for the pits and lift the boxes and machine gun belts out of the

965
01:03:10.501 --> 01:03:15.000
water's way,
piling them a top one another on the earth and gun platform.

966
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:19.800
Any dry place in the pit was reserved for ammunition.

967
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:24.480
He who sought refuge from the rain had to sit on the water cans.

968
01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:26.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

969
01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:30.470
<v 2>There were whole days of downpour where I lay drenched and shivering grade</v>

970
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:34.430
gazing blankly out of my whole watching is the sheet at gray,

971
01:03:34.431 --> 01:03:38.360
rain whipped and any undulated over the ridge.

972
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:39.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

973
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.220
<v 2>At such times,
a man's brain seems to cease to function.</v>

974
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:49.970
It seems to retreat into a depth much as the red core puzzles retreat from the

975
01:03:50.221 --> 01:03:52.470
surface of the body in times of excitement.

976
01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:53.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

977
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:57.650
<v 2>One ceases to be rational.
One becomes only sediment,</v>

978
01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:00.630
like a barnacle clinging onto a ship.

979
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:02.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

980
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:07.210
<v 2>One is aware only of life of wetness of the cold gray rain,</v>

981
01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:14.320
but without this automatic retreat of reasons a man can go only one way.

982
01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.710
He can only go mad.

983
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:27.890
Certain level of detachment there.
Just checking out,
just checking out.

984
01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.050
You're just there,
but you're not there.
Good place too.

985
01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.390
It's a good place to visit sometimes,
you know?

986
01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.540
I don't think you want to live there.
You certainly don't want to live there,

987
01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:43.040
but it's a good place to visit.
Why?
I just think,

988
01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:47.630
I think it's important to get to a point where you're just detaching from your

989
01:04:47.631 --> 01:04:50.930
physical suffering and your physical pain and you just say,
you know what?

990
01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.500
I'm just turned off and you just retreat.
Like he said,

991
01:04:54.501 --> 01:04:56.750
you just retreat into almost like nothingness.

992
01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:01.420
I think it's important maybe to gain clarity or something.
Yeah.

993
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.090
I think you gained some clarity and I think it's a,

994
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:07.810
I think it's a very important defense mechanism to have.
Oh yeah,
you don't,

995
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:10.250
you sometimes when you're doing stuff,

996
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:13.640
you just have to do it like you can't think about it anymore.

997
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.860
You just have to turn your brain off and go,
and I think that's what,

998
01:05:17.861 --> 01:05:19.690
that's what he's talking about right there.
He's not,

999
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.610
he's not participating in it.

1000
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.490
He's just detaching from it and doing what he's got to.

1001
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.740
His body is doing what he's got to do.
Huh.

1002
01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.673
<v 1>Now</v>

1003
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.020
<v 2>they
there.</v>

1004
01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:39.490
There's this whole time they're expecting to be relieved.

1005
01:05:39.491 --> 01:05:44.491
They're expecting to get the get pulled off the island and one of the sergeants

1006
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:49.900
comes out and makes an announcement to them stand by to move out in the morning.

1007
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:53.980
Yeah,
we moving out into a new offensive,

1008
01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.240
get all your foul weather gear ready and be Sure Your Gun's is oiled up and the

1009
01:06:00.241 --> 01:06:04.970
ammunition belts dry eight marines will be up to relieve us in the morning.

1010
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.561
So they,
they,

1011
01:06:07.561 --> 01:06:11.280
they think they're going to get relieved and go to a ship and relax and get,

1012
01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:16.410
get,
get into,
get some relief.
That's what we're leave is right,

1013
01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:22.020
but they get told,
no,
you're going on a new offensive.
So they're in,

1014
01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.610
well here,
going back to the book after nearly five months,

1015
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.850
by the way,
a lot of times you think of the island campaigns,
Japan,

1016
01:06:29.851 --> 01:06:32.070
these are little live ones,
you know,
10 miles long.

1017
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:34.320
You think all that probably took a week,
two weeks,

1018
01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:38.910
five months after nearly five months.

1019
01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.610
This runner,

1020
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.430
and he's going to name all of the different guys at different nicknames.

1021
01:06:44.431 --> 01:06:46.560
You can hear him.
Runner had malaria,

1022
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:51.360
brick barely stirred from the pit except at night.
Who's you're an oak stump.

1023
01:06:51.361 --> 01:06:55.860
We're subject to long periods of depression.
Red had long since left us.

1024
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:59.070
I had dysentery.
Chocolatier was irritable.

1025
01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:03.450
All of us were emaciated and weakened beyond measure,

1026
01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.840
but we were to move out on the attack.

1027
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:10.860
We could not move to chow without gasping for breath,

1028
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:13.170
but we were to move on the enemy.

1029
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:17.910
We despaired in the morning.

1030
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:22.380
We crouched by our guns and waited for the order to dismantle them and move out.

1031
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.380
It did not come,

1032
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:31.170
nor did it come the next day or the next and hope came creeping back.
Blushing,

1033
01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.440
ashamed of her.
Loyal dis offer.
Disloyal flight,

1034
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.920
but commending herself to us once more with the promise.

1035
01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:41.160
Never again to desert the ramparts.

1036
01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:45.810
Then one morning the word came to move out.

1037
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:51.420
Sergeant Dandy gave it to us.
Leave the guns behind.
He said,

1038
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:56.040
take only your rifles and foul weather geared.
He grinned.

1039
01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:57.780
We're being relieved.

1040
01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:02.010
It was December 14th,

1041
01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:07.010
1942 we had been on the lines without relief since August 7th my battalion,

1042
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:14.210
the second battalion first regimen was the last of those in the First Marine

1043
01:08:14.431 --> 01:08:19.430
Division to come out of a lines.
Guadalcanal was over.

1044
01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:21.723
<v 3>We had one</v>

1045
01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:29.860
next,
he's,
they get

1046
01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:34.820
<v 2>pulled back off the island now and he's climbing aboard the ship of the board.</v>

1047
01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:38.480
Cargo Nets.
He's exhausted.

1048
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:41.540
I was able to reach the top of the net book could go no further.

1049
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:44.600
I could not muster the strength to swing over the gunnel.

1050
01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:47.060
And I hung their breathing heavily.

1051
01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.480
The ship's hot side swing away from me in the swells.

1052
01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:54.920
The very perdition lapping beneath me until two sailors grabbed me or to the

1053
01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:56.420
armpits and pulled me over.

1054
01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:01.430
I fell with a clatter among the others who had been so broad a board and I lay

1055
01:09:01.431 --> 01:09:06.290
with my cheek pressed against a warm,
grimy deck.
My heart beating rapidly.

1056
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:11.060
Not from this exercise,
but from happiness.

1057
01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:13.870
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1058
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:18.850
<v 2>And he ends up having a sailor,
a conversation.
Him and his buddy chocolate,</v>

1059
01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:21.490
who's like one of his best friends,
they,

1060
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:24.370
they are end up having a conversation

1061
01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:30.760
with one of the sailors.
And you said the soldier seems surprised.

1062
01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:34.930
He says,
you mean Guadalcanal?
The guy says at,
was it rough?

1063
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:40.030
How was it?
Rough.
Rough.
We answered mechanically.

1064
01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:44.980
Then chocolate spoke up.
You Mean Guadalcanal?
The soldier seem surprised.

1065
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.760
Sorry.
The conversation with the soldier that was on the ship that hadn't been to

1066
01:09:48.761 --> 01:09:53.080
Guadalcanal.
The soldiers seem surprised.
Of course I do.

1067
01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.980
Chocolate hasten to explain.
I wasn't being wise.
I meant,

1068
01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:59.860
had you ever heard of the place before you got here?

1069
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:04.360
His astonishment startled us and idea was dawning.

1070
01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.180
You mean how yes,
Guadalcanal the first marines.

1071
01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.630
Everybody's heard of it.
You guys are famous.

1072
01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.730
You guys are heroes back home.

1073
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:20.890
We did not see him leave for,
we had both looked away quickly,

1074
01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:26.530
each embarrassed by the quick tiers.
They had not forgotten.

1075
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:29.893
<v 3>And</v>

1076
01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:33.950
<v 2>again,
I kind of breezed through that part in,
in the book.</v>

1077
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.550
But a lot of times when they were in those moments of despair,

1078
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.040
they'd be thinking,
no one knows what's going on here.

1079
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:42.980
They don't know how bad at this,
but the reality was was this,

1080
01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.800
this war or this battle that lasted five months,

1081
01:10:45.801 --> 01:10:49.760
there was all kinds of reporting and the glory of the f of the Marines and what

1082
01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:52.400
they were doing.
And so they were,

1083
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:55.940
I guess they were just overwhelmed with the fact that this,

1084
01:10:56.030 --> 01:11:00.200
this soldier had said,
you guys,
are you kidding me?
Guadalcanal?
This is it.

1085
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:05.150
Now after they leave Guadalcanal,

1086
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.733
<v 3>they,</v>

1087
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:10.980
<v 2>it's some much needed r and r</v>

1088
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:13.980
rest and they'd get to

1089
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.810
<v 0>go to Australia to do this.
And they,</v>

1090
01:11:17.811 --> 01:11:22.440
they go into the book of all the regimens.
Ours,

1091
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:27.530
the first was in the most advantageous position for the great Dibaj discipline

1092
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:35.780
already dissolved in the delicious squeals of the girls all but disappeared that

1093
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:37.883
night.

1094
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:42.890
We'd received part of our six months arrears of PE in Australian pounds,

1095
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.180
but we were issued no clothing.
We still wore our disheveled dungaree.

1096
01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:53.181
So you can imagine these guys are coming off of Guadalcanal hell and now they're

1097
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:56.280
rolling into Australia and,
and they describe it here.

1098
01:11:56.281 --> 01:11:59.250
The girls are waiting for them.
These are the heroes of Guadalcanal.

1099
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:05.300
So they roll in and they get after it in the way that we talked about earlier.

1100
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:10.730
They start,
they start just do there.

1101
01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:15.580
They're going crazy.
And He,
and this is one of them,

1102
01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:18.510
one of the things I loved about this book is that this,

1103
01:12:18.511 --> 01:12:23.100
that Robert Lecky is so real.
He's so real.
He's just a,

1104
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:28.170
he's just real.
And,
and guess what he likes to do?
He likes to get after it.

1105
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:33.600
He goes out,
he drinks,
they drink,
they chase women,
he goes hard.

1106
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:37.410
And YG ends up getting in some,

1107
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.810
getting a little bit into some trouble.

1108
01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:43.920
And he talks about bring rats,

1109
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:46.440
basically guys that have been thrown in the Brig,
which is,

1110
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:50.220
which is the military jail.
And on a ship they actually have a little break,

1111
01:12:50.221 --> 01:12:53.310
you know,
little jail room and you can get thrown in there.

1112
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.880
And so he talks a little bit about that.

1113
01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:02.310
It is most especially a marine sediment sentiment.

1114
01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.170
And when analyzed,

1115
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:09.300
it turns out to be not shameless or shocking,
but merely this,

1116
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:15.170
a man who lands in the brig is apt to be a man of bold spirit and independent

1117
01:13:15.451 --> 01:13:16.140
mind.

1118
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:21.140
Who must occasionally rebel against the harsh and unrelenting disciplined of the

1119
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:25.710
camp.
I'm not attempting to exalt what should be condemned.

1120
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.850
I'm not suggesting that because of their boldness or independence,

1121
01:13:29.851 --> 01:13:33.600
the brig rats be per be forgiven and escape punishment,

1122
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:37.680
Briggs,
they must be and Briggs,
they were.

1123
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:41.790
Nor Am I.
Speaking of the Habitual Brig Rat,

1124
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.100
the steady Maliner who the good for nothing,

1125
01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:51.510
who is more often in the brig then out of it and who seeks to avoid every

1126
01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:54.360
consequence of his uniform.
Even fighting,

1127
01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:00.600
I speak of the young high hearted soldier whose very nature is bound to bring

1128
01:14:00.601 --> 01:14:03.810
him into conflict with military discipline and a land him,

1129
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:09.230
unless he's exceptionally lucky in the Brig I speak of chocolate and chicken and

1130
01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:12.370
oak stump and a dozen others

1131
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:17.920
<v 2>and of course of myself.
So he's saying,
look,</v>

1132
01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:21.670
you got guys that are high spirited go getters and they're gonna,

1133
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.640
they're gonna get after it on the battlefield and they're going to get after it

1134
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:27.970
on liberty and sometimes they're going to get rolled up unless they're super

1135
01:14:27.971 --> 01:14:30.130
lucky and that doesn't make them bad people.

1136
01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.300
And I had one of my buddies get in really big trouble.

1137
01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:39.130
This is when we were young guys
back in the day,

1138
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:43.660
back in the day,
one of my Bros,
he got in big trouble.

1139
01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.040
And I thought that our officer,
who's one of the best officers I ever worked for,

1140
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:51.960
I thought he was going to really be,
you know,
just crushed him.
And,

1141
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.090
and I thought he's going to be really disappointed in all of these horrible

1142
01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:55.924
things.
And this is the guy,

1143
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:59.890
the officer was a guy that we all loved and wanted to always impress and we want

1144
01:14:59.891 --> 01:15:04.430
to do good job for it.
So when my buddy had this big incident that he did,
which,

1145
01:15:04.431 --> 01:15:08.470
you know,
he was drunk and got crazy and you know,
got arrested and all that,

1146
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.670
all that bad stuff.

1147
01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:14.650
And I talked to our OIC about it and I said,
hey sir,
you know,

1148
01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:21.010
I mean,
what's going to happen with my buddy?
And the officer goes,

1149
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.903
Hey,

1150
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:26.200
you guys are young warriors and things like this are going to happen.

1151
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.040
Don't let them happen much,
but they're going to happen and we'll deal with it.

1152
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:34.630
And I will send myself,
I wonder why I love this guy so much.
But that's,

1153
01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:38.380
that's exactly it.
You know,
he was,
he knew that,
that,

1154
01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:40.750
you know,
you had young,

1155
01:15:40.751 --> 01:15:45.250
rambunctious guys full of testosterone and then you add alcohol into the

1156
01:15:45.251 --> 01:15:49.630
equation and you add chaos into the equation because some guys might get in

1157
01:15:49.631 --> 01:15:52.450
trouble again,
I hate to,

1158
01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:56.800
to give that credence to this type of stuff.
Cause when I look back,

1159
01:15:56.801 --> 01:15:58.360
I wish I would've been a better leader.

1160
01:15:58.361 --> 01:16:01.000
I wish I would have been doing other things,
you know?

1161
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:05.320
But if you're in a leadership position and you've got guys like this and you

1162
01:16:05.321 --> 01:16:08.230
condemn them,
instead of trying to help them,
you're not helping them.

1163
01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.750
It goes back to this judgment thing that we talked about earlier.

1164
01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.260
If I'm looking at you saying,
oh,
you don't,
you don't,
uh,

1165
01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:19.450
you got in trouble.
You're a bad person.
I don't want you on this team.

1166
01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:22.930
Instead of saying,
hey look,
we got to get you under control.

1167
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:25.630
You've got the right attitude.
You've got the lot of energy.

1168
01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:29.140
Let's focus it on somewhere.
Correct.
Let's focus it on something good.

1169
01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.890
Let's get you doing something positive instead of doing something negative

1170
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.850
instead.
Sometimes guys go to the judgmental mode,
you know,

1171
01:16:36.851 --> 01:16:40.240
I'm just gonna judge you and Oh,
you got in trouble,
so you're bad.

1172
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.060
That's the wrong attitude to have.
And how about you got in trouble?

1173
01:16:43.061 --> 01:16:45.550
How bout me as the leader,
I let you down.

1174
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.820
I didn't show you the right way to expend your energy.

1175
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.240
I didn't give you the opportunity to give you an outlet for this.

1176
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:57.460
This aggression that you have because you are aggression,
you're going to have,

1177
01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:00.430
that means fighting you.
You don't think you get up.

1178
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:04.480
You get a guys that are in the military.
You want someone in your platoon.

1179
01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:07.590
Do you want them to be not aggressive?
Of course you want be,

1180
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:10.760
I want the most aggressive bastards you can imagine.
And guess what?

1181
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:13.010
If you don't give them something to do with that aggression,

1182
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:15.920
they're going to find something to do with it and is not going to be good.

1183
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.211
So as a leader,

1184
01:17:17.211 --> 01:17:19.880
let's find something positive we can that they can do with their aggression.

1185
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:24.620
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not like he's out there and not like it's known.
You know,

1186
01:17:24.621 --> 01:17:29.180
like in your case you,
you,
you thought he was going to get severely punished,

1187
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.660
you know,
so it's like,
it's not like he's out there publicly say nay.

1188
01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:37.330
That's cool dude.
You got to do player.
Right.
But when it happened,
yeah,

1189
01:17:37.331 --> 01:17:41.780
it's like,
and I think truly that officer who is a great guy,

1190
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:45.020
he truly probably felt exactly what I just said.

1191
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:48.980
I should have given them a better outlet for this aggression.
You know,

1192
01:17:48.981 --> 01:17:51.860
I should have let,
I should have figured something better out for them to do.

1193
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:57.260
We gotta do something.
You give us idle hands and pockets full of money.

1194
01:17:57.261 --> 01:18:00.650
Can you imagine these guys are getting six month pay enrollment.

1195
01:18:00.651 --> 01:18:04.360
They were the richest guys in the world.
I guarantee it.
You know,

1196
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.010
especially you rolling into wartime Australia.
I mean,

1197
01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:08.450
you know how stringent they were with,

1198
01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:13.690
with the restricting the money that people were using and spending all over the

1199
01:18:13.911 --> 01:18:15.290
world to save money for the war.

1200
01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:19.190
And here come these guys in richest guys ever heroes,
a qual of canal.

1201
01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.520
They're going to get after it,
they're going to get after it.
So as leaders,

1202
01:18:25.521 --> 01:18:28.580
what we need to do is give them a proper outlet because those guys want to get

1203
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:30.890
after it.
But when you got to give him the right way,
you know,

1204
01:18:30.891 --> 01:18:33.050
you gotta give them something positive that they can work on.

1205
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:35.180
And if you're going to let them do something negative,

1206
01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:39.550
then let's put some barriers around them so they don't get into trouble.
Yeah.

1207
01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:46.280
Wish I would've known this when I was at,
when I was coming up,

1208
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.760
I would have done more positive stuff instead of more negative stuff.

1209
01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:55.340
So now we get the trouble piece and these,

1210
01:18:55.341 --> 01:18:57.770
he's got so many great stories about how these guys,

1211
01:18:57.771 --> 01:19:02.510
what these guys were going through and this,
so they're out.

1212
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:07.400
He's out drinking in one of his buddies,
a guy that I mentioned before,

1213
01:19:07.401 --> 01:19:11.960
his name is chocolate chocolate is actually on duty.
So He's,
he's standing duty,

1214
01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:13.790
which means he's in uniform,
he's not allowed to drink,

1215
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:17.870
he's watching and he's been,
you know,
he,
he's,
he's on duty.

1216
01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.870
And so here we go.

1217
01:19:20.871 --> 01:19:24.770
I found chocolatier standing glumly outside the slop shoot entrance.

1218
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.780
He'd hope for the interior guard where he might sneak a beer or two.

1219
01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.000
I'll get you one.

1220
01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:37.001
I promised I returned with a big glass out of which chocolate might take a

1221
01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:38.990
surreptitious sip.

1222
01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.160
There were more side ELLs until Chutler said I got to go to the head here,

1223
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:50.020
cover for me.
He gave me his pistol belt and helmet and made off.

1224
01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.550
So now Lech he's drunk right now.
You're okay.

1225
01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:59.390
So
but,
but chocolate says,
hey man,

1226
01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.710
I gotta take a Piss here,
take my helmet,
take my pistol cover for me

1227
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.230
first century to be drunk.
And then dessert

1228
01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:13.240
<v 0>as post and surrender as a weapon is to combine cardinal sin with unforgivable</v>

1229
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.910
offence.
I was anxiously hoping that he would hurry back.

1230
01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.900
But then an unfortunate thing happened,

1231
01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.890
Lieutenant Ivy League came striding down the corridor.

1232
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:30.780
I say it was unfortunate because Ivy League was the officer of the day.

1233
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:35.130
More than that,
he was still the man who had filched my cigars,

1234
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.380
the enlisted men cigars,
if you will.

1235
01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:41.460
So at one point he had gotten ahold of some cigars and this officer had taken

1236
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:45.150
him.
And by the way,
also,

1237
01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:47.850
you know,
uh,
uh,

1238
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.600
Robert Lucky he's an Irishman and I'm not going to,
you know,

1239
01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:55.920
make a generalization.
Okay?
Yes I am.

1240
01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.660
He's a hot tempered Irishman.
And so he sees this,

1241
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:04.170
he sees this guy and it then he's drunk.
He just got off of Guadalcanal.

1242
01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:07.320
And here's what happens.
Back to the book,

1243
01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:12.180
my anger was nourished by the alcohol within me and I drew chocolates pistol and

1244
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:13.620
pointed at him and said,

1245
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:18.830
stop where you are you lousy cigar stealing son of a bitch or I'll blow your

1246
01:21:19.531 --> 01:21:21.060
gentleman's ass off.

1247
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.650
So
not,
not good.

1248
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:33.950
And he ends up getting in pretty significant trouble and he actually gets bread

1249
01:21:38.671 --> 01:21:40.680
and water,
which they still do that in the military.

1250
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.430
They get bread and water you can get,
he gets bread and water for five days.

1251
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:46.480
So in the break,
bread and water for five days,
that's,

1252
01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.580
that's the punishment that he gets.

1253
01:21:47.581 --> 01:21:50.280
And he gets docked pay and he gets the busted down.
In Rick,

1254
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:55.980
one time I was on a ship deployed Brooklyn,

1255
01:21:55.981 --> 01:21:59.100
a jury and we were in a seal platoon.

1256
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:05.070
And I think after I've told the story before,
it was the one where the marines,

1257
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:10.130
like we would stay on the ship when we pulled into port and it would,

1258
01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.910
it would take like an hour to get off the ship because everyone would be waiting

1259
01:22:14.911 --> 01:22:19.230
in line.
And so what we would do is we would just work out for that hour,

1260
01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:20.880
hour and a half,
and then would have golf.
We could just walk right off the ship.

1261
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:24.390
Well,
in that hour and a half,
the marine,
this,

1262
01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:27.630
this young marine had gone off the ship and was getting carried back onto the

1263
01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:30.960
ship,
like passed out drunk,
covered in puke in an hour and a half.

1264
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:32.910
So that's what I think of when I think of these poor guys.

1265
01:22:32.911 --> 01:22:34.350
Can you come out and coming off of Guadalcanal?

1266
01:22:34.351 --> 01:22:38.310
You haven't even had water for six months.
Nevermind alcohol.

1267
01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:41.670
It's a nightmare.
But,

1268
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:46.740
and of course they don't punish him too bad.
Well,
they,
they punish him,

1269
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:50.400
but they got to keep him,
you know,
I mean,
he's an able body marine.

1270
01:22:50.401 --> 01:22:52.860
They're not going to,
if they're not going to waste an able body marine.

1271
01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:55.770
And hopefully the colonel and the back of his mind was thinking himself,

1272
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.790
you know what,
I want this guy in my don't want this guy with me.
You know,

1273
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:03.710
this guy that's just going to,
you stole cigars from me.
Cool.
I'm going to,

1274
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:06.130
I'm not threatened your life just getting nuts.

1275
01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:11.890
<v 2>So they,
but now Australia ends,</v>

1276
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.030
they roll back out and it's time for them to start getting prepared to,

1277
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.460
they go to,
they go to New Guinea and if you remember New Guinea,

1278
01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:24.180
it's another hard battles fought there primarily by the Australians and

1279
01:23:24.551 --> 01:23:25.420
underdose primarily.

1280
01:23:25.421 --> 01:23:30.421
But the Australians definitely fought because I read that letter from the

1281
01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:34.480
Australian soldier to his two year old daughter.
That's where he died,

1282
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:36.370
was in New Guinea.
But now new Guinea is,

1283
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:41.460
is owned by the allies and they'd go there to train to start to prepare for

1284
01:23:43.721 --> 01:23:46.570
their next big push.
And here we go.
Back to the book,

1285
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:51.400
the Chuck climbed a series of small hills and finally deposited us in the middle

1286
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:54.670
of a field of Kunai grass,
our new home.

1287
01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:58.450
This is how the marines trained their men.

1288
01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:03.370
Keep them mean and nasty like starving beasts says the core.

1289
01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.500
And they will fight better when men are being moved from one place to another.

1290
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.260
Spare no effort to make it painful.

1291
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:13.690
And before they've arrived at their destination,

1292
01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:18.810
dispatch a man ahead to survey the ground with an eye toward diff discomfort.

1293
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:22.660
So you hear this all the time that that's what the Marine Corps,

1294
01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:24.730
the Marine Corps is going to make you so pissed off.

1295
01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:26.380
By the time you go into battle,

1296
01:24:26.381 --> 01:24:30.130
you're just gonna kill everybody because you're so sick of living in the dirt.

1297
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:37.500
Now they do a decent amount of training and now they're preparing to assault

1298
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.740
another island called new Britain.
And this is,
I found this very interesting.
So

1299
01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:46.931
back to the book,

1300
01:24:46.931 --> 01:24:50.590
the commander called us together that night and delivered an eve of battle

1301
01:24:50.591 --> 01:24:55.480
speech.
He spoke in deliberate but angry tones.

1302
01:24:55.570 --> 01:25:00.570
He spoke like a man who hated the Japanese as though he had suffered a personal

1303
01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:06.121
affront at their hands and was bent on personal vengeance as though this worry

1304
01:25:07.991 --> 01:25:10.120
personal,
not mechanical war.

1305
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:13.760
His harangue seemed unreal.

1306
01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:19.150
It was unreal because it could never produce the desired effect.

1307
01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:21.890
Kill the Japs.
The commander was saying,

1308
01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.970
I want you to kill Japs and I want you to remember that your marines,

1309
01:25:26.690 --> 01:25:30.380
we've got a tough job where we're going and where we're going.

1310
01:25:30.381 --> 01:25:32.330
You won't have much room for ammunition,

1311
01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:36.500
so you'd better be sure you see something before you shoot.

1312
01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:42.820
Don't squeeze the trigger until you've got meat and your sites and when you do

1313
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:47.150
spill blood spill yeller blood,

1314
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:53.030
that was all we walked back to the tense.

1315
01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.240
It was Christmas Eve and I find this,
it's Christmas Eve.

1316
01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.840
He gets this speech and you can see like he's sitting here if this thinking,

1317
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:07.220
okay,
this guy's trying to get them all riled up and it's not having any impact

1318
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:13.190
and this is what I found to be a real dichotomy here at the tents.

1319
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:14.630
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1320
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:19.610
<v 2>Father's straight was preparing to say midnight mass.
So they have a chaplain,</v>

1321
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:24.830
Catholic chaplain,
father straight,
and here's what he says.

1322
01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:27.110
Father's straight spoke gently.

1323
01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:33.890
He reminded us that not all of us would live to see another Christmas that

1324
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:37.100
perhaps some of us might die this very day.

1325
01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:42.940
He told us to be sorry for our sins,
to ask the forgiveness of God,

1326
01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:45.100
to forgive those who have wronged us,

1327
01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:48.370
to prepare our souls for death.

1328
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:52.880
We sang hymns.

1329
01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:54.140
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1330
01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:57.110
<v 2>1,940 odd years ago.</v>

1331
01:26:57.230 --> 01:27:02.230
The baby had been born in Bethlehem and we celebrated him this night in a dark

1332
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:06.530
and misty forest that his father had wrought.

1333
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:09.470
We sang him.

1334
01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:10.630
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1335
01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:12.520
<v 2>We sang hymns to him.</v>

1336
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.670
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1337
01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:18.110
<v 2>Silent night and Hark.
The Herald Angels Sing Mild.</v>

1338
01:27:18.111 --> 01:27:23.111
He lays his glory by born that man no more may die.

1339
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:26.923
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1340
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:31.760
<v 2>Dan.
Tomorrow our hands would be stained with the blood of our brothers,</v>

1341
01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:39.160
but we sang on halfheartedly half hoping we sometimes mechanically,

1342
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:43.220
sometimes with a desperate driving poignancy.

1343
01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:44.510
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1344
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:45.950
<v 2>one hand on the heart,</v>

1345
01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:51.310
<v 5>the other on the hilt of a bayonet</v>

1346
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:57.950
<v 2>in the morning we marched down to the ships.</v>

1347
01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:08.340
So much more impactful on him was what father straight and much more than the

1348
01:28:09.611 --> 01:28:14.230
fiery kernel that said,
we're going to go kill jabs here.
These guys are,

1349
01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:16.210
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1350
01:28:16.210 --> 01:28:16.451
<v 2>I mean,</v>

1351
01:28:16.451 --> 01:28:21.451
can you imagine you go in for comfort to midnight mass Christmas Eve and you get

1352
01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:23.854
told

1353
01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.033
<v 5>that</v>

1354
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:28.270
<v 2>many people,</v>

1355
01:28:28.271 --> 01:28:33.010
many of you may die this very day and to prepare your soul for death,

1356
01:28:33.730 --> 01:28:37.030
that's what these guys are facing.
That's what their most trusted,

1357
01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:39.520
the most trusted person in our lives,
right?

1358
01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:43.300
Their spiritual counselor is telling them,
prepare for death

1359
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:48.120
<v 5>yet kinda like Kinda like what we talk about sometimes where</v>

1360
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:51.520
<v 2>get a guy,
like if you're watching a video,</v>

1361
01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.320
you know and it's the guy getting you fired up.

1362
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:56.770
You know he's getting fired up to get you fired up.
Sometimes it could work,

1363
01:28:56.771 --> 01:29:00.250
but a lot of times that won't really work cause you kind of feel like he's

1364
01:29:00.251 --> 01:29:03.540
trying to sell you something.
But then if you hear someone,

1365
01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:07.650
maybe even talking to someone else or talking about something else and you just

1366
01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:12.390
kind of extrapolate certain things that get you fired up because it's so

1367
01:29:12.391 --> 01:29:16.770
authentic and it's basically the indirect approach on your own mind.
Yeah.

1368
01:29:16.771 --> 01:29:18.600
On your mind.
Yes.

1369
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:26.250
Back to the book on the sunless shores of new Britain where the rain forest

1370
01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:28.080
crowded steeply down to the sea.

1371
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:33.350
We have the first marine division came back to the assault and it was here that

1372
01:29:33.571 --> 01:29:35.520
we cut the Japanese to pieces.

1373
01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:40.610
Literally when that devouring jungle did not dissolve them and it was here that

1374
01:29:42.161 --> 01:29:43.270
we pitied them

1375
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:50.030
now to pay enemy is either madness or is it a sign or it is a sign of strength.

1376
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:55.410
I think that with the First Marine Division on new Britain,

1377
01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:57.750
it was a sign of strength.

1378
01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:04.530
We pitied him in the end,
this fleeing fold,

1379
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:09.450
disorganized,
demoralized,
crawling on hands and knees.

1380
01:30:09.451 --> 01:30:12.600
Even in that desolving downpour

1381
01:30:14.290 --> 01:30:16.480
for in the end

1382
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:23.110
it was we the soft of feet Americans who had learned to get along in the jungle

1383
01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:32.130
and who bore up the best beneath the ordeal of the monsoon and in these things

1384
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:35.950
lay our strength.

1385
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:44.790
And I'll tell you what I think that boils down to.
So what they're saying,

1386
01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:46.110
here's the,
you know the Americans,
what it,

1387
01:30:46.111 --> 01:30:51.090
what do people around the world think of the Americans even in 1943 Americans

1388
01:30:51.091 --> 01:30:53.370
are soft,
Americans are lazy Americans,

1389
01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:56.850
they have their too much comfort and you think the exact opposite of the

1390
01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:59.820
Japanese,
especially in World War II,
the imperial Japanese army,

1391
01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:03.300
it was highly disciplined.
It was extremely strict.

1392
01:31:03.301 --> 01:31:05.040
It was a spartan lifestyle.

1393
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:08.490
But look at what happened here and why is that.

1394
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.080
And I'll tell you why in my opinion,
I will tell you why.

1395
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:17.250
Because you have men that are fighting for freedom,

1396
01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:22.140
they're fighting for freedom and that makes all the difference in the world.

1397
01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.600
Fighting for individual freedom,

1398
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:29.070
fighting for their personal freedom and fighting for their nation's freedom and

1399
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:30.540
fighting for their nation's freedom.

1400
01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:33.360
And it's a nation that is based upon freedom.

1401
01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:36.990
That right there is stronger than any

1402
01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.393
tyrannical

1403
01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:45.960
government or any fanatical idea.

1404
01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:54.240
The idea of freedom is stronger than the mall and that is why these quote soft

1405
01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.673
Americans.

1406
01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:01.680
That is why they were able to conquer and defeat this enemy,

1407
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:06.870
this hardened enemy,
this well-trained enemy

1408
01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:16.450
and this talks a little bit about what we were facing.

1409
01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1410
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:19.661
<v 2>To the north.</v>

1411
01:32:19.661 --> 01:32:23.800
One patrol discovered the body of an he company scout who had been reported

1412
01:32:23.801 --> 01:32:25.990
missing the area,

1413
01:32:25.991 --> 01:32:30.991
bore the marks of a struggle as though we had fought hand to hand his body board

1414
01:32:31.271 --> 01:32:35.860
dozens of bayonet net wounds.
They had used him for bayonet practice

1415
01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:41.860
in his mouth.
They had stuffed flesh.
They had cut from his arm.

1416
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:47.510
His buddy said he had a tattoo there,
the marine emblem,

1417
01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.790
the fouled anchor and the globe.

1418
01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:55.180
The Japs cut it off and stuffed it in his mouth.

1419
01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:57.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1420
01:32:57.710 --> 01:32:59.240
<v 2>The commander was angry</v>

1421
01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:06.170
again to the north to Japanese officers had been caught snooping around our

1422
01:33:06.171 --> 01:33:07.730
positions and had been killed.

1423
01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:09.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1424
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.670
<v 2>An e company outposts,</v>

1425
01:33:10.671 --> 01:33:14.510
scouting the terrain at their front had discovered a Japanese force in platoons,

1426
01:33:14.511 --> 01:33:17.900
strength,
sleeping,
sleeping on the ground,
sleeping.

1427
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:20.390
They fired into them,

1428
01:33:21.170 --> 01:33:24.440
into these sleeping superman of the jungle.

1429
01:33:25.210 --> 01:33:25.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1430
01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.810
<v 2>Withdrawing upon the approach of another enemy platoon.</v>

1431
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1432
01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:38.100
<v 2>And after this,</v>

1433
01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:43.230
after the bulk of the battle takes place,
and it was a fair,
it was,
it was,

1434
01:33:43.231 --> 01:33:46.590
it was not a fair fight and you're about to find out why.

1435
01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:51.930
Back to the book for Japanese soldiers and one officer had been taken alive,

1436
01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:55.680
that he'd been brought down to the CP,
their arms bound behind them,

1437
01:33:55.681 --> 01:33:59.730
knives at their throats,
and from them we learned that the third company,

1438
01:33:59.731 --> 01:34:04.731
53rd Regiment of the Japanese 17th division had been dispatched from the main

1439
01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:08.130
body at Cape Gloucester to defend against our landing.

1440
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:15.310
Their passage had been through near impenetrable jungle and they had not arrived

1441
01:34:15.381 --> 01:34:17.960
on the scene until two days after our own coming.

1442
01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.080
Nevertheless,
they attacked us,

1443
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:23.370
<v 1>okay.</v>

1444
01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:24.330
<v 2>They attacked us,</v>

1445
01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:29.540
some 100 of them against our force of some 1200 and but for the prisoners we had

1446
01:34:30.391 --> 01:34:31.410
an isolated them.

1447
01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:33.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1448
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:37.250
<v 2>Were they brave or fanatical?
What had they hope to gain?</v>

1449
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:40.880
Had their commander really believed that a company of Japanese soldiers could

1450
01:34:40.881 --> 01:34:44.090
conquer a battalion of American marines.
Experienced,
confident,

1451
01:34:44.091 --> 01:34:46.370
better armed and placed on higher ground.

1452
01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:47.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1453
01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.700
<v 2>Why do you not turn it around and marched his men home again?</v>

1454
01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:55.890
Was it because no Japanese soldier can report failure?
CanNot lose face.

1455
01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:58.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1456
01:34:58.090 --> 01:34:59.140
<v 2>I cannot answer.</v>

1457
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.910
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1458
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:03.610
<v 2>Are Dead.
We're six men among them,</v>

1459
01:35:03.611 --> 01:35:08.611
the stubby and trepid ob who might last scene in Melbourne so drunk,

1460
01:35:08.621 --> 01:35:13.030
he could barely stand who's gun pit had been overrun when the Japs overwhelmed a

1461
01:35:13.031 --> 01:35:18.031
section of the lines in their first silent rush up the hillside ob who had

1462
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:23.300
helped to drive them out in the counter attack and who had been alternatingly

1463
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:28.390
firing and hurling imprecations at them until one of their bullets took him

1464
01:35:28.701 --> 01:35:33.470
squarely in the forehead.
May he rest in peace.

1465
01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.390
The Japanese dead lay in heaps on the hillside and they filled the trench.

1466
01:35:39.450 --> 01:35:41.880
We're obese.
Gun had been located.

1467
01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:47.443
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1468
01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:52.960
<v 2>so that shows the will of the Japanese fighters.</v>

1469
01:35:53.110 --> 01:35:54.070
No doubt about it.

1470
01:35:54.370 --> 01:35:59.370
They were hardcore and they got told to attack with a hundred guys against 900

1471
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:02.920
or 1200 and they said,
all right,
let's do this

1472
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:09.950
now the
life,

1473
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:15.110
the existence in this jungle was harsh.
Back to the book,

1474
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:19.040
the puffing of my lips and eyes symbolize the mystery and poison of this

1475
01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:23.990
terrible island.
Mysterious perhaps,
I mean to say new Britain was evil,

1476
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:26.990
darkly and secretly evil.
A malefactor,

1477
01:36:26.991 --> 01:36:29.750
an enemy of humankind,

1478
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.790
an adversary really dissolving,
corroding,
poisoning,
chilling,

1479
01:36:34.791 --> 01:36:38.150
sucking,
drenching,
coming at a man with its rolling,

1480
01:36:38.151 --> 01:36:41.120
Ms. Green Mold and ceaseless downpour,

1481
01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:46.070
tripping and in with his numberless roots and vines poisoning him with green

1482
01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.470
insects and bugs and treasures.

1483
01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:52.490
Tree bark turning the son from his bones and cure from his heart.

1484
01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:55.880
Desolving him,
the rain,
the mold,

1485
01:36:56.090 --> 01:37:01.090
the damp steadily poking each plucking each cell apart like tiny hands tearing

1486
01:37:01.911 --> 01:37:03.260
at the petals of a flower.

1487
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:08.410
Desolving him I say into a mindless formless fluid like the sop of mud and to

1488
01:37:10.761 --> 01:37:14.630
which is feet forever,
fall in a monotonous slop,
suck,

1489
01:37:14.690 --> 01:37:17.630
slop suck.
That is the sound of nothingness.

1490
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:19.760
The song of the jungle we're in.

1491
01:37:19.761 --> 01:37:23.780
Everything falls apart in hollow harmony with the rain.

1492
01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:27.780
Nothing could stand against it.

1493
01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.680
A letter home had to be read and reread and memorized for a fell apart your

1494
01:37:31.681 --> 01:37:34.170
pocket and less than a week,
a pair of socks,

1495
01:37:34.171 --> 01:37:38.570
socks lasted no longer a pack of cigarettes became sodden and worthless unless

1496
01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.710
smoked that day.
Pocket Knife Blades rusted together.

1497
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:47.750
Watches recorded the period of their own decay.
Rain made garbage of the food.

1498
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:50.030
Pencil swelled and burst apart.

1499
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.680
Fountain pens clogged and appoint separated rifle barrels turned blue with mold

1500
01:37:54.681 --> 01:37:56.190
and had to be slung upside down

1501
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.240
<v 0>to keep out.
The rain.</v>

1502
01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.200
Bullets stuck together and the rifle magazines and machine gunners had to go

1503
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:05.250
over their belts daily extracting an oiling and reinserting the bullets to

1504
01:38:05.251 --> 01:38:08.730
prevent them from sticking to the cloth loops and everything.

1505
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:13.560
Lay Damp and sodden at squashy to the touch exuding that steady,

1506
01:38:13.561 --> 01:38:18.561
musty reek that is the jungles own that individual odor of decay rising from

1507
01:38:19.081 --> 01:38:19.980
vegetable life.

1508
01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:24.981
So luxuriant growing so swiftly that it seems to hasten the decomposition from

1509
01:38:25.801 --> 01:38:27.180
the moment of birth.

1510
01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:32.770
It was into this green hell that we were inserted a day or two after the march

1511
01:38:33.670 --> 01:38:37.960
and here was fought that battle with the rain forest here,

1512
01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.200
the jungle and the men were locked in conflict,

1513
01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:45.310
far more basic than our shooting war.
The Japanese for here,

1514
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:48.160
the struggle was for existence itself.

1515
01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.490
The war was forgotten.
Who could comprehend it?

1516
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:57.263
Who cared

1517
01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:06.570
and
route.
What do you say?

1518
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:11.130
A and I have not spent that much time in the jungle.
I spent some,

1519
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:16.050
I think as long as I've been in the jungle was maybe a month and it wasn't as

1520
01:39:16.051 --> 01:39:18.360
bad as this.
It wasn't raining as that much,

1521
01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:24.030
but I can't even imagine just that constant,

1522
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:25.440
there's no escape from it.

1523
01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:29.880
There's no escape from it and it's even worse for lucky.

1524
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:34.260
And I'll tell you why.
Back to the book,
I would be wet,

1525
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.990
not only from the rain for sometimes it's stopped and at other times it did not

1526
01:39:39.991 --> 01:39:42.810
fall so fast that a jungle hammock could not repel it,

1527
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:47.120
but because an affliction which I had begun,
which had begun,

1528
01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:50.580
the moment I left Australia was now again active.

1529
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:52.620
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1530
01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:57.280
<v 0>It had begun during the discomforts of Guadalcanal had disappeared in the</v>

1531
01:39:57.281 --> 01:40:02.281
civilized living of Melbourne and had reappeared on good enough island,

1532
01:40:03.850 --> 01:40:06.550
New Guinea.
And now on new Britain

1533
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:09.930
I laid,

1534
01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:14.930
I learned later from doctors to call it and your recess when asleep,

1535
01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:19.320
the bladder empties.
And that is that.

1536
01:40:22.590 --> 01:40:25.140
So he puts that really nicely,

1537
01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:31.130
but here's what's going on because of the stress that he's under when he goes to

1538
01:40:31.921 --> 01:40:32.754
bed,

1539
01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:38.100
he pisses in his pants and it's just,

1540
01:40:38.101 --> 01:40:42.630
he just,
he can't stop it and there's nothing he can do about it

1541
01:40:44.230 --> 01:40:48.910
and it won't go away.
In fact,

1542
01:40:48.911 --> 01:40:52.000
it went away.
It will go away when the stress stops,

1543
01:40:52.690 --> 01:40:54.760
when he to Melbourne is all good.
It stops,

1544
01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.160
get back out there and the stress of combat,

1545
01:40:57.161 --> 01:41:00.970
the stress of the environment and when he goes to bed,
he pisses himself.

1546
01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:01.973
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1547
01:41:04.050 --> 01:41:04.883
<v 0>And</v>

1548
01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:12.900
certainly he made a decision to put that in this book for a reason.

1549
01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:13.923
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:18.640
<v 0>And the there is there,
it does fall into the story a little bit.</v>

1551
01:41:18.641 --> 01:41:23.641
But the reason I love that he put it in there is because it's just another thing

1552
01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.680
that he's dealing with.
And he's not even ashamed of it.
You said,
yeah,
can't,
yeah,

1553
01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:30.970
I'm stressed out.

1554
01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:35.920
I'm scared and I'm pissing myself,
but guess what?

1555
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:36.910
I'm still going on patrol.

1556
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:45.260
Back to the book,
the last patrol was a prolonged one of several days.

1557
01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:50.620
We were taken by landing boat down the east coast to a place called old,

1558
01:41:50.811 --> 01:41:53.630
not Timo,
and they're deposited.

1559
01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:58.460
The place had once been inhabited by the Japs,

1560
01:41:58.790 --> 01:42:01.250
but all they're in placements were now empty.

1561
01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:06.680
Those are the enemy who were discovered when the last extremities of ordeal.

1562
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:11.450
Some were overtaken crawling on their hands and knees,

1563
01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.880
some so badly decomposed.

1564
01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:18.530
It was as though their feet were rotting off some wing,

1565
01:42:18.531 --> 01:42:22.160
perhaps no more than 80 pounds,
some without weapons,

1566
01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:27.340
all without food and all possessed of that indomitable fighting spirit.

1567
01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:32.060
That was the Japanese imperial armies greatest asset.

1568
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:36.680
The one single factor that made a poorly equipped soldier,

1569
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:38.600
a first rate foe.

1570
01:42:40.590 --> 01:42:44.640
They all resisted and they were all destroyed.

1571
01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:48.900
Bayonetted for the most part for it was file for,

1572
01:42:48.901 --> 01:42:53.901
it was folly to fire on patrol in unfriendly unknown territory.

1573
01:42:55.380 --> 01:43:00.180
One of these stragglers was strangled in cold blood by the kid.
A youngster who,

1574
01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.460
although already a veteran of Guadalcanal was hardly acquainted with a razor,

1575
01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.880
he would go mad two months later.

1576
01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.230
So they come up across these Japanese total,
80 pounds

1577
01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:17.990
malnourished.

1578
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:22.610
Some of them didn't even have weapons and they're just trying to fight.
Anyways,

1579
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:30.000
he ends up with a hernia.

1580
01:43:31.110 --> 01:43:35.780
So lucky well ends up with a hernia.
And the EEG,

1581
01:43:35.781 --> 01:43:40.770
he gets pulled off to go take a look at his hernia and they say,

1582
01:43:40.771 --> 01:43:43.860
yeah,
you got a bad hernia,
but it's not bad enough.

1583
01:43:43.890 --> 01:43:44.970
You're going back to the front.

1584
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:51.830
Then the army comes and replaces them there.
And uh,
next thing,

1585
01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:52.220
next

1586
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:57.220
<v 2>move is they go to train adequate at a place called [inaudible] blue island or</v>

1587
01:43:58.461 --> 01:44:01.460
doing another training to get ready for another island campaign.

1588
01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:06.950
And here we go.
Back to the book.
The food was bad too,

1589
01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:09.290
and the tents were rotten and punctured with holes.

1590
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:12.290
There was no water except what was caught in our helmets during the night.

1591
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:15.920
We bathed by dashing,
naked into the rain,

1592
01:44:15.921 --> 01:44:19.670
soaping ourselves madly in a race against the probability of the rain ceasing

1593
01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.700
and being left streaked and sticky stope soap.

1594
01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:26.970
And we washed our clothes by boiling them in cans of rainwater.

1595
01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:30.320
Our jungle rot had become so bad,

1596
01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:34.460
so persistent that there was an appointed time each afternoon for the men to

1597
01:44:34.461 --> 01:44:39.200
take off their shoes and socks and a lie out on their sacks with corrosive feet

1598
01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:40.610
thrust out into the sun.

1599
01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:46.900
But we had borne all this before and we could bear it again,

1600
01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:52.620
nor could mere bad food or leaky tents press upon the ardor of my comrades.

1601
01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:56.860
It was the death of hope that bore us down.

1602
01:44:58.530 --> 01:45:02.400
They're in always been hope,
hope of relief,
hope of the sun,

1603
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:04.950
hope of victory,
hope of survival.

1604
01:45:05.610 --> 01:45:09.750
But when they came and told us that none of us were going home on rotation,

1605
01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:14.250
we strangled hope and turned into wooden soldiers.

1606
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:20.390
The future look to innumerable enemy held islands and a numerable assaults.

1607
01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:26.310
And we had already noticed how the ranks of the new river originals were

1608
01:45:26.311 --> 01:45:28.290
dwindling with every action

1609
01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:35.020
or even a few suicides to suggest how despairing some could find the situation.

1610
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.863
<v 3>Then</v>

1611
01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:40.640
<v 2>the thing changed.</v>

1612
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:46.510
They came and said half of the originals could go home so these guys get the

1613
01:45:46.881 --> 01:45:47.960
word,
hey look,

1614
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:52.070
we're praying for another assault but half of you originals are going to go
home.

1615
01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:58.820
There was joy and then once the method of selection for the state side bound

1616
01:45:59.491 --> 01:46:02.310
became known,
there was anger.

1617
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:04.590
There would be a drawing,

1618
01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:08.850
a state side lottery in which men's names will be pulled from a hat,

1619
01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:13.710
but only the names of those who had never been in trouble.

1620
01:46:15.330 --> 01:46:20.300
I was among those whose name did not go into the hat and so was runner and who's

1621
01:46:20.301 --> 01:46:23.640
your and chicken and souvenirs and a host of others.

1622
01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:28.500
It seemed that the originals of the second battalion first marines had been

1623
01:46:28.501 --> 01:46:32.070
neatly divided into good guys and bad guys

1624
01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:36.780
among us,
their rage to profane anger.

1625
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:38.783
I know now,

1626
01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:43.860
how will convict must feel upon being turned down a job after being turned down

1627
01:46:43.861 --> 01:46:46.170
a job after job because of his past.

1628
01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:50.460
That was what disqualified our past.

1629
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:53.670
<v 0>It made no difference that we had been punished.
Yes.</v>

1630
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:58.140
Punished again and again for to become customary to solve all problems of

1631
01:46:58.141 --> 01:47:03.141
selection this way by marking brig rats for dirty duty and excluding them from

1632
01:47:04.441 --> 01:47:05.940
special benefits.

1633
01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.470
Nor did it matter that we had good war records.

1634
01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:12.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1635
01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:20.020
<v 0>In retrospect,
it's easy to forgive my commanders this,</v>

1636
01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:21.970
but then it was hard.

1637
01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:27.070
It was too much like being unfairly condemned to death.

1638
01:47:28.450 --> 01:47:32.680
The injustice of it overwhelmed me and I burned with a resentment that was

1639
01:47:32.681 --> 01:47:34.270
dangerous to carry around.

1640
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:42.030
So what uh,
what did,
what a nightmare.
They say,

1641
01:47:42.031 --> 01:47:43.350
look,
we're going to have a little lottery.

1642
01:47:43.351 --> 01:47:45.510
Some of you guys are going to get at home.
Everyone's happy.
And they say,

1643
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:48.360
by the way,
if you've been in any trouble,
you're,
you don't get on the list.

1644
01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:52.580
And that's a death sentence.
The way he's seen it,
right,
right there.

1645
01:47:52.590 --> 01:47:53.670
Soon as a death sentence.
Oh,

1646
01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:56.160
we're going to keep it doing this island hopping campaign.

1647
01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:57.173
We're going to keep going.

1648
01:47:57.570 --> 01:48:00.840
There's all these innumerable islands that need to be taken down.

1649
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:01.980
You're going to be on all of them,

1650
01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:07.010
and you've already seen x number of guys that you had killed and you're going to

1651
01:48:07.011 --> 01:48:10.350
keep going until you're killed.
And so this was like a death sentence,
you know?

1652
01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:14.300
Meanwhile,
the guys who might be able to go,
they're just,
they're right there,

1653
01:48:14.530 --> 01:48:16.580
like right next to you.
Yeah,
man.

1654
01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:22.480
And those guys probably did a lot of the same crap,
right?
Yeah.

1655
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.633
Yeah.

1656
01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.870
So the back to the book mine,

1657
01:48:27.871 --> 01:48:31.860
you're my enuresis was more noticeable than before,

1658
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:35.970
perhaps to the agitation of the moment.
Aggravated it.

1659
01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:40.740
I know that the men in my tent had been urging me to report it to sick bay.

1660
01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:41.963
I did.

1661
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.140
The doctor who knew of my case ordered me to be Nika.

1662
01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:51.720
I was leaving in the morning.
So
with that,
he basically says,

1663
01:48:51.721 --> 01:48:54.510
okay,
you know what?
I'm pissing on myself.

1664
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.900
The guys have been telling me to go see the doctor about it.
I haven't done that.

1665
01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:01.140
I have a hernia.
I'm going to go to medical.

1666
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:04.860
So he goes to medical and the doctor says,
okay,
you're going to go to Benito.

1667
01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.000
Benito is a,

1668
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:10.140
is a island where they just aren't set up to handle wounded

1669
01:49:12.810 --> 01:49:16.800
and when he gets to Benito,
it's,
it's kind of shocking

1670
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:22.860
back to the book,
but Nico was a flash pot but was the big town,

1671
01:49:22.861 --> 01:49:26.130
but Nika was Broadway.
Benita had women.

1672
01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.460
It had buildings of steel and wood.
It had roads.

1673
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:33.790
It had thousands of sailors as sleek as cam ponds.

1674
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.090
It had movie amphitheaters,
it had electric lights.

1675
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:44.180
It had canteens overflowing with candy and comforts and Benita had beer walking

1676
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:50.620
the augers from the beach to the Navy hospital.

1677
01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:55.710
I felt like a hick on his first visit to New York jeeps and trucks and staff

1678
01:49:55.841 --> 01:50:00.490
cars swept over the islands.
Roads raising a busy cloud of dust cranes,

1679
01:50:00.491 --> 01:50:05.000
croaked and cranked on the beach,
loading and unloading the boats.
NPS patrol,

1680
01:50:05.001 --> 01:50:08.860
the stockade of pointed sticks behind which dwelt the women,

1681
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.580
the Navy nurses and Red Cross workers.

1682
01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.540
Everyone was well fed and unworried.

1683
01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:21.700
The seat of every pair of pants was filled and happy.

1684
01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.153
We,

1685
01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:29.440
the lean ones who wore our discontent on our faces and carried our nervous

1686
01:50:29.441 --> 01:50:30.880
impatience in our hands,

1687
01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.200
must have been a disturbing presence in that pairing island incubator.

1688
01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.190
Yet as I walked along,

1689
01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.420
I was filled with the uneasy suspicion that would,

1690
01:50:43.450 --> 01:50:48.450
it would be the image of [inaudible] and not pursue that would be presented to

1691
01:50:49.631 --> 01:50:52.000
America as the Pacific war.

1692
01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:56.320
They do that pretty good job of this and the Pacific in the series,

1693
01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:01.060
not as good as they maybe could have done because they show,

1694
01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.630
they show the guys coming onto a beach and there's nurses and they're dressed in

1695
01:51:04.631 --> 01:51:05.860
like beautiful,
clean white,

1696
01:51:05.861 --> 01:51:09.820
and they're literally handing out lemonade and it's such a contradiction to what

1697
01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:13.030
they've been living.
So,
so you get that,
but,

1698
01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:16.900
but this image is even crazier in my mind of coming onto this island.

1699
01:51:16.901 --> 01:51:21.760
You becoming off Pervu who you're living in hell and here these guys are

1700
01:51:21.761 --> 01:51:22.091
whatever,

1701
01:51:22.091 --> 01:51:25.480
a quick flight away and they've got movie theaters and they've got beer and

1702
01:51:25.481 --> 01:51:29.770
they've got women running around.
It's just totally,
totally different.

1703
01:51:29.770 --> 01:51:32.230
I've talked about that a bunch of times on here.
Like you could be,

1704
01:51:32.231 --> 01:51:33.820
you could be in world war two,

1705
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:38.890
but if you are on the island of [inaudible] wasn't that much of a sacrifice as

1706
01:51:38.891 --> 01:51:41.260
it was compared to somebody that was on the island hopping campaign.

1707
01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.750
Just it's not,
and it's the same thing.
You know,

1708
01:51:43.751 --> 01:51:46.330
there's places I was in Iraq where I would say,
God,

1709
01:51:46.331 --> 01:51:51.000
this is crazy how nice this is.
They've got a swimming pool,
the bay,

1710
01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:54.460
some of the base said swimming pools.
They got a nice gym,

1711
01:51:54.461 --> 01:51:56.380
they've got a nice Chow Hall.
Then you'd go out to some,

1712
01:51:57.130 --> 01:52:01.090
some outstation in the middle of,
or some forward operating base,

1713
01:52:01.091 --> 01:52:03.220
and these dudes would be live in hard,

1714
01:52:04.930 --> 01:52:06.670
totally different for different people.

1715
01:52:09.370 --> 01:52:14.370
Now lucky gets put basically into a psych ward.

1716
01:52:15.070 --> 01:52:17.500
They want to look at him and he's,

1717
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:23.550
he starts having this conversation with a psychologist and I think this is a

1718
01:52:24.521 --> 01:52:27.640
very important conversation.
Back to the book,

1719
01:52:27.641 --> 01:52:32.560
he began to question me about my experiences in war.
And as I told them to him,

1720
01:52:32.561 --> 01:52:36.970
he shook his head from side to side as though to indicate that my whole
division,

1721
01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:39.970
not only myself,
ought to be psychoanalyzed.

1722
01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:44.950
Then we talked of books for,
he was well read and philosophy.

1723
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:50.230
Suddenly he broke it off and said,
what did you say you were
meaning?

1724
01:52:50.231 --> 01:52:54.010
What was he saying?
Like,
what did you say you did in the Marine Corps?
A scout?

1725
01:52:54.130 --> 01:52:55.120
I said,
proudly.

1726
01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:59.890
I used to be a machine gunner and the doctor says back,

1727
01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:04.600
but that's no place for a man of your caliber.
Now,

1728
01:53:04.601 --> 01:53:05.980
I was shocked.

1729
01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:12.240
The old shibboleth intelligence had not our government been culpable enough in

1730
01:53:14.981 --> 01:53:19.981
pampering the high Iq draftees as as though they were too intelligent to fight

1731
01:53:21.971 --> 01:53:25.870
for their country.
Could not doctored gentle.

1732
01:53:25.930 --> 01:53:30.460
See that I was proud to be a scout.
And before that,
a machine gunner,

1733
01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:36.280
intelligence,
intelligence,
intelligence,
keep it up.
America.

1734
01:53:36.730 --> 01:53:41.730
Keep telling your youth that mud and danger are fit only for intellectual pigs.

1735
01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:48.840
Keep on saying that only the stupid or fit to sacrifice that America must be

1736
01:53:49.871 --> 01:53:54.330
defended by the low brow and enjoyed by the high brow.

1737
01:53:55.840 --> 01:54:00.840
Keep fonting head over heart and soon the head will arrive at the complete folly

1738
01:54:02.471 --> 01:54:07.471
of any kind of fight and meekly surrender the treasure to the first bandit with

1739
01:54:09.131 --> 01:54:10.780
enough heart to demand it.

1740
01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:19.780
Be careful.
That's,

1741
01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:24.670
I think that we do a really good job now in America.

1742
01:54:25.390 --> 01:54:27.940
You get kids that are,
you know,

1743
01:54:27.970 --> 01:54:32.970
there'll be enlisted kids with bachelor's degrees and master's degrees in the

1744
01:54:33.941 --> 01:54:36.370
army and the Marine Corps in the seal teams.

1745
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:39.010
I don't think we have that as much,

1746
01:54:39.011 --> 01:54:42.040
but it's definitely something that you need to watch out for.

1747
01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:44.740
And I think especially this goes back to judgment,

1748
01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:50.650
I posted that on the other day.
I W I met some young marine,
no,

1749
01:54:50.651 --> 01:54:52.190
not young marine,
but you know guys,

1750
01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:57.230
probably 25 27 years old and he came into the gym and you know,
it's like,

1751
01:54:57.231 --> 01:55:00.400
oh,
he was in the Marine Corps Os and all cement,
which doing the marine corps,

1752
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:05.620
he was an awesome machine gunner.
I'm like,
yes,
like yes,
that's awesome.

1753
01:55:05.650 --> 01:55:09.970
And,
but to have somebody think,
oh,

1754
01:55:09.971 --> 01:55:13.240
you're just a machine gun or you must've,
you,
no,
no.

1755
01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:17.170
Being a machine gunner should be a vaunted,

1756
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:22.240
an elevated position in the world.

1757
01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.960
Bless the machine gunners out there.

1758
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.310
Do you want to talk about a person that can get stuff done?

1759
01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:35.970
Go Talk to a machine gunner?
Yeah,
they will make some stuff happen.

1760
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:38.550
They're carrying a big pig have gone around,

1761
01:55:39.570 --> 01:55:44.280
they're laying down fire under pressure.
Put him off with the,

1762
01:55:44.281 --> 01:55:48.060
I'll put the machine gunner up against one of these intellectuals any day the

1763
01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:51.900
week bring it,
but the machine that it can be an intellectual.
Absolutely.

1764
01:55:52.710 --> 01:55:56.390
Absolutely.
That's the point.
That's the point,
right?

1765
01:55:56.790 --> 01:56:00.120
Just because someone chooses to do something that's hard doesn't mean that

1766
01:56:00.121 --> 01:56:03.750
they're not smart.
In fact,

1767
01:56:03.751 --> 01:56:08.751
I'd go so as far as to say they are searching for and,

1768
01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:14.620
and discovering and becoming something that takes a level of mind power to do.

1769
01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.390
Yeah.
Kind of like the week

1770
01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:26.100
<v 5>superficial assumption is that,
oh,</v>

1771
01:56:26.101 --> 01:56:30.120
you're going to choose that kind of that hard thing because it's not really

1772
01:56:30.121 --> 01:56:32.540
intuitive to just,
I'm going to go for the hardest thing.
It's,

1773
01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:36.360
it's intuitive to be like when you get this easy thing to do because it's
easier.

1774
01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.640
So when someone chooses the hard thing to do that the kind of that assumption is

1775
01:56:41.641 --> 01:56:46.470
that you had no other choice.
Oh yeah.
You know?
Yes.
Perfect.
Yes.
Numb.

1776
01:56:46.471 --> 01:56:47.580
And I think that's what,

1777
01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:51.670
I had a guy in high school where he was a year older than us and he was like a

1778
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:55.920
smart guy and had all his stuff to get a good family and he went into the army

1779
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:59.880
and I remember some people were like kind of surprised because like,
oh,

1780
01:57:00.170 --> 01:57:03.630
you're going to just do the army that you know,
like doctor gentle here.

1781
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:07.230
Well what are you doing that for?
Cause I want to be a machine gunner.
Yeah,

1782
01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.610
that's why.
Yeah.

1783
01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:10.860
<v 0>Perhaps the machine gunners</v>

1784
01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:16.230
now out on this island,
he's there,

1785
01:57:16.231 --> 01:57:21.231
he spends like a month and they're sitting down to watch a movie at the theater.

1786
01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:29.250
I remember one time we had the awesome CBS that that worked for were in Ramadi

1787
01:57:29.251 --> 01:57:33.780
with us and so they're building,
they're building bunkers.
I'm not kidding.

1788
01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.930
Like what were their priority builds when they were in Ramadi with me on our

1789
01:57:36.931 --> 01:57:38.500
little Camp Camp Mark Lee,

1790
01:57:39.450 --> 01:57:44.450
the priorities that they were working on were bunkers were security walls on the

1791
01:57:46.531 --> 01:57:49.530
river,
getting barbed wire.
Those are the priorities they were working on.

1792
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:53.480
And my lead,
CB,
my CB chief,
he's,

1793
01:57:53.481 --> 01:57:58.481
he had to go to our headquarters for a couple of days to get money and get

1794
01:57:58.771 --> 01:58:02.010
equipment and whatever.
And when he came back,

1795
01:58:02.730 --> 01:58:03.870
he was great dude.

1796
01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:07.980
His nickname was biggie and he was big.

1797
01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:13.500
And then one of those things,
yeah,
yeah,
no,
his,
he would,
he would,

1798
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:16.440
he would like his warm up sets on bench.

1799
01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:20.730
We're three 15 he was big and he's strong,
he's strong.

1800
01:58:21.630 --> 01:58:26.070
And he came back and you know,
he says,
he says,
Hey sir,

1801
01:58:26.250 --> 01:58:29.400
coming back from Felucia.
And I was like,
oh,
everything cool out there.
He goes,

1802
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:33.390
let me tell you something.
I was like,
what's that baby?
He says,
you know what,

1803
01:58:33.391 --> 01:58:36.090
they're building out there.
I said,
no,
I have no idea.

1804
01:58:36.091 --> 01:58:38.220
I don't care what they're building other because they're building a theater.

1805
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:42.040
I said,
he said,
they're building

1806
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.960
<v 2>a theater.
I said,
you mean a movie theater?
He goes,
yes,</v>

1807
01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:48.850
off the aider and,

1808
01:58:48.851 --> 01:58:53.851
and he was just beside himself because here we were trying to build bunkers and

1809
01:58:54.041 --> 01:58:58.120
security walls and they were building a theater big.
He didn't like that,

1810
01:58:59.590 --> 01:59:01.360
but go cvs,
man.
They kept us.

1811
01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:05.560
They kept everything rocking and rolling props once your props to the machine

1812
01:59:05.561 --> 01:59:08.320
gunners ops to the CBS for sure.

1813
01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:13.860
So they were in a theater that had been built out here and the movie began.

1814
01:59:14.890 --> 01:59:19.780
There was an interruption over a public address system of voice announced allied

1815
01:59:19.781 --> 01:59:22.150
troops of just invaded northern France.

1816
01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.090
The second front has been opened.

1817
01:59:26.230 --> 01:59:26.580
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1818
01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:27.061
<v 2>cheers.</v>

1819
01:59:27.061 --> 01:59:31.320
And shouts rose into the soft night to be followed by a buzz of excitement.

1820
01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:35.130
But then the film began and silence was restored.

1821
01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:36.460
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1822
01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:40.750
<v 2>I arose and left the amphitheatre,
my heart throbbing and excitement.</v>

1823
01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:43.450
It was difficult to comprehend this excitement.

1824
01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:47.260
It was a mix of thrill and pride,

1825
01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:52.440
but predominating was the heartbeat of anxiety for suddenly it had been born in

1826
01:59:53.050 --> 01:59:56.350
upon me that great events were happening,

1827
01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:01.800
that the war was now rushing downhill to victory and here I was clad and pallet

1828
02:00:02.531 --> 02:00:04.930
pajamas and robe lounging around.

1829
02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:09.931
The hospital yearning came upon me in a rush and I wept hurrying along the dark

1830
02:00:11.441 --> 02:00:15.580
road back to the hospital.
I wanted to rejoin my comrades.

1831
02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:17.250
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1832
02:00:17.250 --> 02:00:22.250
<v 2>so he goes into see Dr Gentle goes into his office and basically they work it</v>

1833
02:00:24.331 --> 02:00:28.200
out back to the book.
There's not much we can do for this trouble of years.

1834
02:00:28.201 --> 02:00:31.170
The hospital commander told me,
there's no carrying it out here.

1835
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:35.490
What you need is a change of climate and the less nerve wracking assignment,

1836
02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:41.340
you're shipping me back the state,
sir.
I asked,
he smiled.
Wayne Lee,
ordinarily,

1837
02:00:41.341 --> 02:00:45.810
yes,
unfortunately you marines can't go home unless you're carried home.

1838
02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:48.510
So we are sending you back to duty with this,

1839
02:00:48.810 --> 02:00:52.980
with the suggestion that your commanding officer have the century wake you

1840
02:00:52.981 --> 02:00:53.814
during the night.

1841
02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:58.230
I laughed and he laughed and doctor gentle laughed

1842
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:02.980
cause they knew that's not something that's feasible.

1843
02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:05.460
What they're basically saying is you're going to go back and you're just going

1844
02:01:05.461 --> 02:01:09.100
to piss yourself and you're going to fight and that's exactly what he wanted.

1845
02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:14.080
He gets back there and now,

1846
02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:15.540
<v 4>okay,</v>

1847
02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:20.430
<v 2>back to the book,
we left Porvoo victors of Guadal canal in new Britain.</v>

1848
02:01:20.730 --> 02:01:24.930
We went out to fight again,
marching into the open job landing craft,

1849
02:01:24.931 --> 02:01:26.460
driven up on the beach,

1850
02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.480
never before where we so confident of victory.

1851
02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.260
Never again what its price be.
So high.

1852
02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:39.180
Hello Lou was already a holocaust.

1853
02:01:40.710 --> 02:01:41.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1854
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:46.510
<v 2>The island flat in almost feature list was an alter being prepared for the</v>

1855
02:01:48.681 --> 02:01:51.440
ambulation of 17,000 men.

1856
02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:59.720
So they're going on to Pella,
Lou,
and here we go right into it.

1857
02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:02.600
They're in their landing craft.
The water began to rub it in.

1858
02:02:02.601 --> 02:02:05.930
Little geysers in the air became populated with exploding steel.

1859
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:07.520
The enemy was saluting us.

1860
02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:11.780
They receiving us with mortar and artillery fire 10,000 Japanese,

1861
02:02:11.781 --> 02:02:13.030
a weighted on the island of Pella.

1862
02:02:13.031 --> 02:02:17.390
Pellalou 10,000 men is brave and determined and skillful as ever.

1863
02:02:17.391 --> 02:02:21.920
A garrison was since the art of warfare began.
Skillful.

1864
02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:22.730
Yes,

1865
02:02:22.730 --> 02:02:27.730
it was a terrible rain and it did terrible work among us before we reached the

1866
02:02:28.071 --> 02:02:28.904
beach.

1867
02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:30.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1868
02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:33.400
<v 2>Our Amtrak was among the first assault waves,</v>

1869
02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:36.880
yet the beach was already a litter of burning black Indian fib.

1870
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:39.280
Ian Tractors of dead and wounded,

1871
02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:43.900
a mortar garden of exploding mortar shells.

1872
02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:49.560
Holes had beer scooped in the white sand or had been blasted out by the shells.

1873
02:02:51.070 --> 02:02:56.070
The beach was pocked with holes all filled with green clad helmeted marines.

1874
02:02:57.370 --> 02:03:01.420
We were pinned down,
we were pinned down,
but not by mortars alone.

1875
02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:04.450
Machine gun fire came from an invincible outpost,

1876
02:03:04.451 --> 02:03:08.620
which the Japanese had blasted out of a coral jutting into the bay.

1877
02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:10.840
We found an opening in it.

1878
02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:15.370
And even then we're filling it with all manners of small arms,
fire grenades,

1879
02:03:15.371 --> 02:03:16.270
sticks of dynamite,

1880
02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:21.070
dynamite hurled by men who had crept up to it or billowing fire from the flame

1881
02:03:21.071 --> 02:03:23.560
throwers who had also gained the whole,

1882
02:03:24.010 --> 02:03:28.030
but the answering fire continued to rake are deadly picnic ground.

1883
02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:33.493
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1884
02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:39.090
<v 2>And the reason for that is here for the Japanese had possessed Pellalou for two</v>

1885
02:03:39.091 --> 02:03:42.720
decades and had blasted into the coral,

1886
02:03:42.721 --> 02:03:47.420
a network of mutually supporting caves so that,
so these,

1887
02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:52.260
they'd been there for 20 years preparing for this and so they've got this

1888
02:03:52.261 --> 02:03:57.261
massive cave network and Aiden to every time they hit one of these locations,

1889
02:03:57.330 --> 02:03:58.590
the more guys would just pop up.

1890
02:03:59.950 --> 02:04:00.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1891
02:04:00.690 --> 02:04:04.170
<v 2>and they also,
the Japanese also had tanks on Pellalou back to the book.</v>

1892
02:04:04.171 --> 02:04:06.480
Their tank swooped in suddenly upon us.

1893
02:04:07.050 --> 02:04:11.670
They came tearing across the airfield,
a dozen or so of them.
It was startling.

1894
02:04:11.790 --> 02:04:13.170
They'd come out of nowhere.

1895
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:16.860
And here we're only riflemen and machine gunners to oppose them.

1896
02:04:17.670 --> 02:04:19.830
It was a violent outburst of gunfire.

1897
02:04:19.831 --> 02:04:24.600
I poked my head above the crater through the lacy branch work of the scrub
trees.

1898
02:04:24.601 --> 02:04:28.760
I saw an enemy tanks streaking along with snipers and camouflage hanging onto

1899
02:04:28.770 --> 02:04:33.750
the rear.
It was bought a moment's glance,
but at the time my,

1900
02:04:33.751 --> 02:04:36.780
I caught sight of a marine from f company,

1901
02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:41.070
a running bowlegged to the rear,
his face,
riving shouting tanks,

1902
02:04:41.071 --> 02:04:45.990
tanks and officer grabbed him and spun him around and kicked him and propelled

1903
02:04:45.991 --> 02:04:48.960
him back to his post in the crater.

1904
02:04:48.961 --> 02:04:53.430
We'd prepared for defense like a caravan attacked by Indians.

1905
02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:56.520
The enemy tanks whizzed past their little,

1906
02:04:56.770 --> 02:05:01.110
their little wheels whirling within the tracks.
Machine guns,
clattered,
Bazookas,

1907
02:05:01.111 --> 02:05:01.680
whammed.

1908
02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:06.680
Our airplanes came screeching down from heaven and there rose the detonation of

1909
02:05:07.081 --> 02:05:11.910
their bombs and the roar of exploding tanks to my right.

1910
02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:17.010
I saw a line of our tanks advancing firing as they came seemed to stop each time

1911
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:21.900
their guns stuttered and it was over.
The jap tanks had been destroyed.

1912
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:30.750
I turned to go and as I did,
nearly stepped on someone's hand.

1913
02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:32.770
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1914
02:05:32.770 --> 02:05:34.450
<v 2>Excuse me.
I began to say,</v>

1915
02:05:34.810 --> 02:05:39.810
but then I saw that it was an unattached hand or rather a detached one.

1916
02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:45.610
A lay there alone,
open palm upwards.
Clean,
capable,

1917
02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:46.810
solitary.

1918
02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:48.080
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1919
02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:52.460
<v 2>I could not tear my eyes from it.
The hand is the artisan of the soul.</v>

1920
02:05:53.470 --> 02:05:58.470
It is the second member of the Human Trinity of head and hand and heart.

1921
02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:04.080
A man has no faculty,
more human than his hand.

1922
02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:08.340
None more beautiful,
nor expressive nor productive

1923
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:13.940
to see this hand flying alone as though contempt,
you're asleep,

1924
02:06:13.941 --> 02:06:16.940
cast aside,
no longer a part of man,

1925
02:06:17.090 --> 02:06:22.090
no longer has help was to see war in all its wantonness.

1926
02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:28.840
It was to see the especially brutal savage three of our own technique of

1927
02:06:29.391 --> 02:06:30.224
rending.

1928
02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:31.320
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1929
02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:36.320
<v 2>and it was to see men at their eternal worst turning upon one another,</v>

1930
02:06:36.930 --> 02:06:38.130
tearing one another,

1931
02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:43.490
clawing at their own innards with the maniacal fury of the pride possessed.

1932
02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:47.300
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1933
02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:48.990
<v 2>Not much.
I can comment on that one.</v>

1934
02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:55.320
Back to the book are casualties were extremely heavy.

1935
02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:00.210
Before the day was done.
They would total 500 in the first regimen,

1936
02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:05.420
something like 20% this on the first day we were advancing again,

1937
02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.970
our objective with bloody nose ridge.

1938
02:07:09.630 --> 02:07:12.690
This was the high ground visible from across the airfield.

1939
02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:15.660
It gave the enemy perfect observation,

1940
02:07:16.650 --> 02:07:21.650
advancing across the flat table of crushed coral on which there was hardly a

1941
02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:27.501
single depression as we were easily excited as clay ducks in a shooting gallery.

1942
02:07:28.710 --> 02:07:29.470
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1943
02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:32.140
<v 2>but there was no other route and we had to take it.</v>

1944
02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:36.250
Grass cutting machine gun swept the airfield

1945
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:40.930
<v 0>mortars,
mortar shells fell with the comm.
Regularity of automation.</v>

1946
02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:46.600
Marines fell.
They crumpled,
they staggered,

1947
02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:51.520
they pitched forward,
they sank to their knees,
they fell backwards.

1948
02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:55.250
They kept advancing.

1949
02:08:04.770 --> 02:08:06.150
The mortars had stopped.

1950
02:08:08.090 --> 02:08:11.050
The first F company wave was advancing across the airstrip,

1951
02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:14.030
running low with ranks,
scattered breasting,

1952
02:08:14.031 --> 02:08:17.960
a withering machine gun fire that had been,
that'd be gun to rake the runway.

1953
02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.860
They were falling.
It seemed on real.

1954
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:25.010
He seemed a Tablo,

1955
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.950
like a scene from a motion picture.

1956
02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:33.470
It required an effort of mind to recall that these were flesh and blood marines,

1957
02:08:33.590 --> 02:08:37.400
men whom I knew whose lives were linked with mine,

1958
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:43.830
still more was required in facing up to the fact that my turn was next.

1959
02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:52.160
And here is the point in battle where one needs the rallying cry here where the

1960
02:08:52.741 --> 02:08:56.880
banner must be unfurled or the song song where the name of the cause flung at

1961
02:08:56.881 --> 02:09:00.570
the enemy,
like a challenge.
Here is the mounted charge.

1962
02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:06.320
The thing is old as warfare itself that either overwhelmed the defense and wins

1963
02:09:06.571 --> 02:09:09.630
the battle or is broken and brings on defeat.

1964
02:09:11.690 --> 02:09:16.160
How much less forbidding might have been that avenue of death that I was about

1965
02:09:16.161 --> 02:09:21.161
to cross had there been some wholly irrational shout like viva emperor or the

1966
02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:28.900
Marine Corps forever rather than that educated voice which in the sang froid

1967
02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:36.280
that was at all odds with the event said,

1968
02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:39.110
well,
it's our turn now.

1969
02:09:42.190 --> 02:09:44.860
It's all you're going to get.
That's all you're going to get.

1970
02:09:44.861 --> 02:09:49.420
These marines are getting tore apart by machine gun fire by mortar.

1971
02:09:49.630 --> 02:09:51.550
They're getting tore apart.
Marines are falling left and right.

1972
02:09:51.551 --> 02:09:53.260
They're continuing to advance.

1973
02:09:55.510 --> 02:10:00.510
They're continuing to advance and he's watching this group go across this

1974
02:10:00.521 --> 02:10:02.260
airfield getting mowed down.

1975
02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:07.910
He wants some kind of

1976
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:12.960
motivation in what does he get?
Well,

1977
02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:16.260
it's our turn now crazy.

1978
02:10:17.190 --> 02:10:21.870
I bade goodbye to the artist.
He looked at me,
sadly from beneath his helmet,

1979
02:10:22.290 --> 02:10:25.470
his face made darker and more angular by its shadow.

1980
02:10:26.190 --> 02:10:29.400
He cast a rule for Greg.
Glance in the direction of the air,

1981
02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:34.040
Air Strip and the still falling men.
Good luck

1982
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:36.980
<v 2>kid,
he said,
and turned away.</v>

1983
02:10:37.810 --> 02:10:38.320
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1984
02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:42.100
<v 2>I began to run the heat rose and stifling waves.</v>

1985
02:10:42.101 --> 02:10:45.070
The bullet whispered at times and other times they were not all audible.

1986
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:46.720
I ran with my head low,

1987
02:10:46.721 --> 02:10:51.721
my helmet bumping crazily to obscure my view like waves rising around a small

1988
02:10:51.731 --> 02:10:52.564
ship.

1989
02:10:54.010 --> 02:10:59.010
In a moment I could not see lieutenant deep chest or filthy Fred.

1990
02:11:00.070 --> 02:11:04.930
I was alone and running.
There were men to my left,
still falling.

1991
02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:10.000
I ran him through myself down,
caught my breath,
rose again and ran again.

1992
02:11:10.060 --> 02:11:14.470
Suddenly I ran into a shell crater full of men and I stopped running.

1993
02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:18.040
So the only cover that they have is a shell crater.

1994
02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:23.660
And he dives into this shell crater and there's 10 guys or so in there and one

1995
02:11:25.841 --> 02:11:29.680
of them he's calling this one guy walkie talkie.
Back to the book.

1996
02:11:29.681 --> 02:11:31.900
Walkie talkie sat below me on the crater floor.

1997
02:11:32.290 --> 02:11:36.280
He hunched his shoulders toward me and asked me to twirl certain dials.
I did,

1998
02:11:36.281 --> 02:11:40.930
but he could not seem to get through the came the screech of a shell.

1999
02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:44.980
I braced my back for it even though I knew that the ones you hear are not the

2000
02:11:44.981 --> 02:11:46.030
ones to be feared.

2001
02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:47.920
<v 4>Okay,</v>

2002
02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:52.920
<v 2>but how fear the one that gets you the one you do not here.</v>

2003
02:11:56.670 --> 02:11:58.650
Another voice was audible.

2004
02:11:58.651 --> 02:12:03.651
Now the fifth marines lieutenant who was wounded who was in fact dying as I

2005
02:12:04.321 --> 02:12:08.850
learned later,
we're speaking by walkie talkie to his regimental commander.

2006
02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:11.293
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2007
02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:14.210
<v 2>the gories fifth marines have gone through,
sir.</v>

2008
02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:18.230
He was saying and have achieved the objective.

2009
02:12:19.670 --> 02:12:22.730
We are now in contact with the first regiment.

2010
02:12:31.330 --> 02:12:32.163
Now

2011
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:38.310
there's 10 guys in there and finally one of the captains speaks up.

2012
02:12:41.081 --> 02:12:44.290
How many men?
How many men here from the first marines?
He asked,

2013
02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:48.750
we raised our hands,
six a.
That ought to be enough.

2014
02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:51.400
We better take that block house over there.

2015
02:12:51.670 --> 02:12:53.920
That's where all the machine gun fire seems to be coming from.

2016
02:12:54.070 --> 02:12:56.920
As soon as this shell fire stops,
we'll move out against it.

2017
02:12:58.660 --> 02:12:59.493
Just like that.

2018
02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:03.940
The block house had resisted even naval gunfire.

2019
02:13:04.030 --> 02:13:07.450
They did taken Bob's point blank and remain standing.

2020
02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:12.520
It was obviously covered by amaze,
have pill boxes.
We,

2021
02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:14.530
six of us were to take it.

2022
02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:20.790
Captain might be stupid,
but no one could say that he was not gallon.

2023
02:13:22.650 --> 02:13:27.600
I felt disgusted and resigned myself to an unprofitable def.

2024
02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:34.580
I looked at the men from the WHO regarding us with wonder and envied them for

2025
02:13:35.281 --> 02:13:39.720
having retain diplomatic relations with the state of sanity.

2026
02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:46.090
Their commander was hardly conscious now,
but he had heard

2027
02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:52.560
you waved a hand weekly in our direction and grinned as though to say you'll

2028
02:13:52.561 --> 02:13:55.410
never make it,
but there's no harm in trying.

2029
02:13:57.330 --> 02:14:01.320
And of course to a dying man,
I suppose.

2030
02:14:01.321 --> 02:14:03.450
There was no harm.

2031
02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:11.120
So do you think they're going to do it?
They're going to do it.

2032
02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:13.910
They're gonna charge this block house six guys,
this block houses,

2033
02:14:13.911 --> 02:14:17.540
it's just concrete block house.
Basad machine gun fire coming from it.

2034
02:14:17.630 --> 02:14:22.490
They're going to charge this thing that took bombs straight up that to direct

2035
02:14:22.491 --> 02:14:27.140
hits from bombs.
Crazy.
They,
they make a run for it.

2036
02:14:27.170 --> 02:14:30.950
Back to the book.
The shells drove us back to our creator.
Once again,

2037
02:14:30.951 --> 02:14:34.940
walkie talkie had difficulty with the apparatus he could receive but not sinned.

2038
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:38.540
Battalion was asking for positions.
You better report back to command.

2039
02:14:38.541 --> 02:14:41.690
Post captain said to me,
but come back out.

2040
02:14:42.710 --> 02:14:47.120
So lucky wants to go tell command post what's going on.

2041
02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:52.250
You can imagine there's just machine gun fire mortars going off everywhere.

2042
02:14:52.251 --> 02:14:53.450
He runs back.

2043
02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:58.550
He gets back to the major at the command post.
How is it out there?

2044
02:14:58.551 --> 02:15:01.460
Lucky the major asked bad sir.

2045
02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:05.960
I said adding nothing for my notion of this battle was still confused.

2046
02:15:05.961 --> 02:15:10.380
Jumble of men and movement and explosions in which blistering hot when which a

2047
02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:15.320
blistering hot air field was somehow involved.
Then I arose and said,

2048
02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.640
I better get back out.

2049
02:15:17.410 --> 02:15:17.780
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2050
02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:20.300
<v 2>The major nodded and waved.
Good luck.</v>

2051
02:15:22.730 --> 02:15:23.563
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2052
02:15:23.650 --> 02:15:26.780
<v 2>I took from hold on my Tommy Gun and adjust my pack,</v>

2053
02:15:26.781 --> 02:15:30.970
secured my map case and circled the pile of shell casings to return to the shell

2054
02:15:30.971 --> 02:15:31.804
grader.

2055
02:15:32.590 --> 02:15:37.590
It was my last warlike act for the last time I set my face toward the enemy.

2056
02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:38.970
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2057
02:15:38.970 --> 02:15:43.080
<v 2>About a hundred yards out.
A shell exploded in front of me.
I veered to the right.</v>

2058
02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:46.770
Another shell exploded in front of me.
I veered more another shell,

2059
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:50.430
another but closer for more,
another closer.
Still,

2060
02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:54.180
I halted a horrifying fact became clear.

2061
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:58.020
I inserted myself between the enemy artillery and their target.

2062
02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:00.210
They were hunting something,

2063
02:16:00.330 --> 02:16:04.440
perhaps the ammunition dump behind me and we're walking there fire in its

2064
02:16:04.441 --> 02:16:05.274
direction.

2065
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.920
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2066
02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:09.770
<v 2>There was no cover to go forward,
was to die.</v>

2067
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:13.760
I could only run away from this approaching death hoping to get out of the

2068
02:16:13.761 --> 02:16:17.180
target area before it caught me.
I turned and ran.

2069
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.430
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2070
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:22.930
<v 2>I ran with the heat shimmering in waves of from the coral with the sweat oiling</v>

2071
02:16:22.931 --> 02:16:27.340
my joints and the fear drying my mouth with the shells exploding behind me.

2072
02:16:27.341 --> 02:16:29.650
Closer ever closer.
The airfield,

2073
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:34.030
the air filled with the angry voices of shrapnel demanding my life.

2074
02:16:35.310 --> 02:16:35.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2075
02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:39.230
<v 2>I ran with an image in my mind of the Japanese gunner.</v>

2076
02:16:39.231 --> 02:16:43.940
A top is ridge bringing each burst carefully closer to my flying rear,

2077
02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:48.890
chasing me across that baking table in a monster's game of cat and mouse.

2078
02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:54.040
Gleeful at each or burst of speed called forth by a closer explosion and then

2079
02:16:55.251 --> 02:16:59.090
tiring of sport lifting the gun and dropping one before me.

2080
02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:01.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2081
02:17:01.310 --> 02:17:04.700
<v 2>Uh,
shell landed alongside me perhaps five feet away,</v>

2082
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:09.020
but it did not explode or at least I do not think it did.
One cannot be certain.

2083
02:17:09.021 --> 02:17:13.600
It's such time.
There is a different space and time with fear.

2084
02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:14.930
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2085
02:17:14.930 --> 02:17:17.810
<v 2>but there was a shell at two foot blob of burning red,</v>

2086
02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:22.490
which struck the choral with a thunderclap and seem to glance off into the year

2087
02:17:22.491 --> 02:17:24.980
and go wailing away into the bay.
With that,

2088
02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:30.100
I called upon my remaining strength and also then the Japanese Gunnar hit his

2089
02:17:30.441 --> 02:17:33.050
target.
The ammunition dump was hit.

2090
02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:34.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2091
02:17:34.670 --> 02:17:38.270
<v 2>The war ended for me.
I had been shattered.
No good.</v>

2092
02:17:38.390 --> 02:17:39.680
A dry husk.

2093
02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:41.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2094
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:44.780
<v 2>Modern war had had me a giant lemon.</v>

2095
02:17:44.781 --> 02:17:49.400
Squeezer had crushed me.
Dry Concussion,
heat,
thirst,

2096
02:17:49.550 --> 02:17:52.880
tension,
all had had their way with me.

2097
02:17:54.690 --> 02:17:58.230
I must've stumbled about unable to speak until at last.

2098
02:17:58.231 --> 02:18:01.860
I sank my knees beside to meds,
scratching a fox hole in the sand.

2099
02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:03.540
They were startled.

2100
02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:04.630
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2101
02:18:04.630 --> 02:18:07.540
<v 2>As know from afar,
I could hear them discussing me.</v>

2102
02:18:08.210 --> 02:18:08.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2103
02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.010
<v 2>He can't think.
What do you think's the matter with him?
Search me.</v>

2104
02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:16.210
He don't look wounded.
Maybe he got a near Miss.
Hey Fella,
what's wrong with you?

2105
02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:20.410
Can't just say something.
What do you think we ought to do with him?

2106
02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:22.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2107
02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:25.260
<v 2>They rose and pulled me erect,
got a shoulder,</v>

2108
02:18:25.261 --> 02:18:28.590
a piece beneath my armpits and dragged me like a dummy through the sand.

2109
02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:30.050
Life's like a life,

2110
02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:34.290
like a life size doll in whom the spring had been broken.

2111
02:18:34.410 --> 02:18:38.430
They dragged me to the doctor or corpsman laid me on the blanket,

2112
02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:41.400
tied a ticket to me.
He thrust a needle into my arm,

2113
02:18:41.401 --> 02:18:44.910
which was attached a running hose to a bottle of liquid,

2114
02:18:44.911 --> 02:18:47.930
suspended upside down on a frame.
On a wire frame.

2115
02:18:48.770 --> 02:18:49.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2116
02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:52.750
<v 2>The pair who had brought me,
crouched beside me.
What's wrong with him,
doc?</v>

2117
02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:56.830
One of the mast,
I don't know the corpsman answered.
He's pretty beat up though.

2118
02:18:56.950 --> 02:19:00.460
Blast concussion.
I'm sending him back to the hospital ship.

2119
02:19:01.450 --> 02:19:01.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2120
02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:05.760
<v 2>One of the pair of look longingly at the Tommy Gun beside me has glance seem to</v>

2121
02:19:05.761 --> 02:19:07.140
say you won't need that anymore.

2122
02:19:07.290 --> 02:19:12.000
I told him with my eyes to take it and he slung it over his shoulder with

2123
02:19:12.001 --> 02:19:16.020
immense satisfaction.
Then they left.
They had their reward.

2124
02:19:16.890 --> 02:19:17.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2125
02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:20.570
<v 2>Mortars were falling as they carried me on the beach with about a half a dozen</v>

2126
02:19:20.571 --> 02:19:23.660
other casualties.
We laid there and I wondered,
Dolly,

2127
02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:27.870
if the JAP gunners were to catch me after all,
okay.
At last,

2128
02:19:27.871 --> 02:19:30.590
the landing boat took us a board and rode off for the ship.

2129
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:37.340
I began to feel shame.
The others were badly wounded,

2130
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:42.140
some put out of pain by morphine and here I lay in a corner quietly.

2131
02:19:42.141 --> 02:19:46.070
Retching like a frightened kitten intact my face on blemished,

2132
02:19:46.071 --> 02:19:51.040
my bones on broken,
the war was ending.

2133
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:53.620
I was ashamed.

2134
02:19:55.090 --> 02:20:00.090
My spirit crept away from the eyes staring from the staring eyes.

2135
02:20:00.521 --> 02:20:04.450
That fat is fastened upon us as the boat was drawn up out of the water to the

2136
02:20:04.451 --> 02:20:05.284
deck,

2137
02:20:05.650 --> 02:20:10.000
people in white coats throwing the rail and two of these at the center gaze with

2138
02:20:10.001 --> 02:20:14.860
authority into the boat.
Searching for the wounded most in need of aid.

2139
02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:21.550
I shrank from that expert stair when suddenly one of them pointed at me and said

2140
02:20:21.551 --> 02:20:23.500
him,
get him downstairs right away.

2141
02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:25.110
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2142
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:29.580
<v 2>They grasped me,
stripping me naked as they did,
and hurried me down a ladder,</v>

2143
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:32.970
laying me on a table and again,
frosting a needle into my arm.

2144
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:38.460
With the liquid flowing into my body came to warm flood of returning self

2145
02:20:38.461 --> 02:20:42.590
respect.
The Dole dispiriting shame had disappeared.

2146
02:20:42.591 --> 02:20:47.150
The moment that pointing fingers singled me out,
I had been hurt.

2147
02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:52.780
I was in need of aid with the healing power of which he had no inkling the

2148
02:20:53.221 --> 02:20:55.940
doctor had restored my spirit to me.

2149
02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:02.940
So the war ended for me.
Each day for a week,

2150
02:21:02.941 --> 02:21:07.580
I ascend the ladder to the deck and gazed in morbid fascination at Pellalou.

2151
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:08.880
A mile or so away.

2152
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:10.380
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2153
02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:14.640
<v 2>They were still fighting.
One could hear the sound of the firing</v>

2154
02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:20.170
each day.
The news was bad.
We were winning.

2155
02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:21.990
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2156
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:23.490
<v 2>but at a fearful price,</v>

2157
02:21:27.430 --> 02:21:29.750
and then the battle had been won.

2158
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:35.660
Extermination had come to the Japanese 10,000 on Powell,
Lou and my regimen.

2159
02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:37.670
The first was licking its wounds,

2160
02:21:37.850 --> 02:21:42.850
wounds on the beach of my battalion or force of some 1500 men,

2161
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:47.990
the remained,
but 28 effectives.

2162
02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:53.060
When the command came for the last assault on that honeycomb of caves in pill

2163
02:21:53.061 --> 02:21:53.571
boxes,

2164
02:21:53.571 --> 02:21:58.571
which the Japanese had carved into bloody nose ridge in men and blood and agony,

2165
02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:05.480
the most costly spit of land in the wide Pacific.

2166
02:22:07.170 --> 02:22:10.980
When the command came,
they rose from their holes,

2167
02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:16.160
like shades from subcultures and advanced.

2168
02:22:18.690 --> 02:22:19.800
They could not run,

2169
02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:25.040
they could barely walk and they dragged their weapons but obeyed

2170
02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:28.560
<v 0>and they attacked.</v>

2171
02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:35.330
<v 2>They were taken from the line on the brink of collapse.</v>

2172
02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:41.400
Rutherford was killed.

2173
02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:47.550
He'd been hit by a mortar shell and blown to bits.
White man had been killed

2174
02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:54.010
and the artist,
the artist was dead.
A brave man.

2175
02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:55.810
May he rest in peace.

2176
02:22:59.490 --> 02:23:02.770
Captain dreadnought fell dead of a sniper's bullet.
Yeah.

2177
02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.823
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2178
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:11.330
<v 2>It had become a holocaust in the fullest sense.</v>

2179
02:23:12.350 --> 02:23:12.790
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2180
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:16.030
<v 2>Scores of others in the battalion's perished.</v>

2181
02:23:18.900 --> 02:23:21.270
There were those that have not been mentioned.
This book,

2182
02:23:21.690 --> 02:23:23.730
friends who did not fit the narrative.

2183
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:28.910
Men whose faces I have not forgotten and whose bravery and sacrifice has

2184
02:23:29.851 --> 02:23:34.770
deposited of vast spiritual credit for our nation to draw upon.

2185
02:23:36.650 --> 02:23:37.450
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2186
02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:42.450
<v 2>These two fell wrestling that island rock from the grasp of it's most tenacious</v>

2187
02:23:43.811 --> 02:23:44.644
defender.

2188
02:23:47.860 --> 02:23:48.693
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2189
02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:50.750
<v 2>May they rest in peace.</v>

2190
02:23:57.890 --> 02:23:58.723
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2191
02:24:00.780 --> 02:24:02.280
<v 2>Sacrifice says</v>

2192
02:24:03.930 --> 02:24:06.570
not the blood of your brother,
my friend.

2193
02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:08.630
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2194
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:09.680
<v 2>Your blood.</v>

2195
02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:17.770
That is why women weep when their men go off to war.

2196
02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:20.500
They do not weep for their victims,

2197
02:24:21.610 --> 02:24:22.100
<v 4>okay?</v>

2198
02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:24.350
<v 2>They weep for them as a victim.</v>

2199
02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:28.900
<v 0>That is why</v>

2200
02:24:31.570 --> 02:24:35.590
with the immemorial insight of mankind,

2201
02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:41.800
<v 2>there are gay songs and colorful bands to send them off to fortify their fate.</v>

2202
02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:44.270
They're failing hearts

2203
02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:48.570
not to quick in their lust for blood.

2204
02:24:52.430 --> 02:24:55.580
That is why there are no glorious living,

2205
02:24:57.490 --> 02:24:59.920
but only glorious dead

2206
02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:08.120
heroes turn trader warrior's age and grow soft,

2207
02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:11.750
<v 0>but a victim is changeless</v>

2208
02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:19.190
and sacrifice.
His eternal

2209
02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:37.680
<v 2>sacrifice is he turned on</v>

2210
02:25:43.450 --> 02:25:46.540
and I'll close with the book there.

2211
02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:52.450
Obviously it's an incredible book,

2212
02:25:54.090 --> 02:25:54.870
<v 4>okay.</v>

2213
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:58.230
<v 2>About incredible men.</v>

2214
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:01.483
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2215
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:04.530
<v 2>And their eternal sacrifice.</v>

2216
02:26:10.570 --> 02:26:15.160
And it's so humbling to hear of their sacrifice.

2217
02:26:15.161 --> 02:26:18.640
And I say it over and over and over again,

2218
02:26:18.641 --> 02:26:20.170
and I will continue to say it,

2219
02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:23.740
that we must live lives worthy of their sacrifice.

2220
02:26:29.450 --> 02:26:32.720
The 7,100 killed at Guadalcanal,

2221
02:26:33.170 --> 02:26:37.100
the 2,336 killed a pell Lou,

2222
02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:44.710
then all the soldiers,
sailors,
airmen,

2223
02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:49.920
and Marines who as Robert Lucky said later in his life who fought or who

2224
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:54.550
foremost fighting

2225
02:26:58.280 --> 02:26:59.113
<v 4>fell.</v>

2226
02:27:05.010 --> 02:27:10.010
<v 2>And I think it's also important to remember the example of Robert Leckie who by</v>

2227
02:27:11.491 --> 02:27:14.580
his own admission was no angel,

2228
02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:18.600
no plaster sinked

2229
02:27:21.180 --> 02:27:23.520
but who was truly hero

2230
02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:29.770
and remember that that people,

2231
02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:34.800
all people have good and bad qualities and people make mistakes and they do dumb

2232
02:27:36.791 --> 02:27:41.791
things and get those very people are capable of so much.

2233
02:27:47.890 --> 02:27:52.390
And yet so often
we judge,

2234
02:27:55.430 --> 02:28:00.430
we judge and we judge and we judge and we cast stones.

2235
02:28:06.750 --> 02:28:09.780
But,
but who are we to judge

2236
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:18.360
to?
Who are we to judge when a man like Robert?

2237
02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:20.220
Lucky,
lucky,
lucky,

2238
02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:28.100
who not only drank to excess and chase girls and pulled a pistol on his superior

2239
02:28:29.041 --> 02:28:33.420
officer and who got so nervous,

2240
02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:39.470
so scared,
yes,
I'm going to call it scared.

2241
02:28:39.471 --> 02:28:44.471
Who got so scared that he would lose control of his bladder every time he went

2242
02:28:45.351 --> 02:28:46.184
to sleep.

2243
02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:53.520
And yet he overcame that fear with more bravery in his heart than most of us can

2244
02:28:55.631 --> 02:28:56.980
even fathom.

2245
02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:06.820
So who are we to judge?

2246
02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:12.330
We shouldn't judge people.
We should help them.

2247
02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:21.130
And there's probably nothing more we can do to live a worthwhile life then to

2248
02:29:25.421 --> 02:29:29.630
help people
to help other people,

2249
02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:33.410
Andy and helping other people,
I promise

2250
02:29:35.610 --> 02:29:40.270
do you will be rewarded and you will be helping yourself too.

2251
02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:46.003
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2252
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:50.150
<v 2>And one more thing that we see in this book,
once again,</v>

2253
02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:52.640
is the strength of human.
Will.

2254
02:29:56.720 --> 02:29:57.553
We see

2255
02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:04.030
men tested beyond anything we can imagine.

2256
02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:09.680
And then when they pass that test one time,

2257
02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:12.920
they get given that test again and then again,

2258
02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:19.460
and still they overcome,

2259
02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:25.880
overcome the pain and the suffering in the fear.

2260
02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:34.210
And yet we can't get ourselves out of bed in the morning.

2261
02:30:34.390 --> 02:30:38.590
We can move toward a goal we've set for ourselves.

2262
02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:41.850
Don't allow that.

2263
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:51.800
Remember
the Tannery River,

2264
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:54.620
remember the airfield at Guadalcanal.

2265
02:30:54.621 --> 02:30:59.621
Remember the discipline instilled in every marine at Parris Island?

2266
02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:07.560
Hey and remember what you,

2267
02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:13.510
you remember what you are capable of.

2268
02:31:13.780 --> 02:31:15.970
If you mobilize your will.

2269
02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:17.320
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2270
02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:21.600
<v 2>And if you keep moving,
you keep advancing.</v>

2271
02:31:23.350 --> 02:31:24.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2272
02:31:24.010 --> 02:31:26.740
<v 2>Remember what you are capable of.</v>

2273
02:31:26.890 --> 02:31:31.890
If you keep attacking and attacking and keep attacking and don't stop.

2274
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:41.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2275
02:31:41.450 --> 02:31:46.450
<v 2>Don't stop moving forward and don't stop attacking and don't succumb</v>

2276
02:31:57.210 --> 02:32:01.320
to the suffering and the pain and the fear.
Don't succumb,

2277
02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:04.270
but instead

2278
02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:09.990
move forward and attack.

2279
02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:15.233
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2280
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:22.150
<v 2>and I think that's all I've got for tonight.</v>

2281
02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:29.510
So Echo Charles.
Yes,
the wall.
I'm over here.

2282
02:32:31.430 --> 02:32:33.380
Do it a little decompression.
Sure.

2283
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:37.340
Maybe you could mobilize your will.
Sure.

2284
02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:38.810
To let people know.

2285
02:32:40.250 --> 02:32:43.580
I Dunno how to support this podcast or something.
I do.

2286
02:32:43.581 --> 02:32:47.180
I will make the disclaimer.
It doesn't take much will to do this,

2287
02:32:47.240 --> 02:32:51.620
but I do see it as a time to decompress a little bit,
Bro.

2288
02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:56.500
Seriously,
yeah.
Can you even imagine I can't.

2289
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:58.700
Getting tested over and over again.

2290
02:32:58.730 --> 02:33:03.140
You're going through the hardest possible test with dysentery and a hernia with

2291
02:33:03.141 --> 02:33:06.530
this Ontario are hernia.
You're pissing yourself.

2292
02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:08.210
Your friends are getting killed.

2293
02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:11.630
You pass that test through some miracle and they're like,
yeah,

2294
02:33:11.631 --> 02:33:15.920
you got another test.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
To prepare you for the test.

2295
02:33:15.921 --> 02:33:19.950
We're going to make you suffer more
and then so you get tested again.

2296
02:33:20.850 --> 02:33:23.490
That's cool,
but does not,
doesn't matter.
It's not a final exam.

2297
02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:28.320
You're going to do it again.
It,
and you know,
again,
I say this all the time,

2298
02:33:28.321 --> 02:33:33.321
this is thousands and thousands and thousands of people did this.

2299
02:33:33.570 --> 02:33:36.840
It's not,
it's not.
That's what's,
that's what's important to remember.

2300
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:41.400
This isn't,
this is a civilian.
This guy was a civilian.
Yeah.

2301
02:33:41.401 --> 02:33:45.420
It sounds like this crazy extreme since this is all the cases.
Yes.

2302
02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:49.920
This is a lot of the case.
This is all the cases he talks about.
He says,
look,

2303
02:33:49.921 --> 02:33:51.090
courage was common.

2304
02:33:51.310 --> 02:33:54.930
There was a rare case where we'd get touched by this fear and it would overtake

2305
02:33:54.931 --> 02:33:57.480
guys and wave wave.
We bolster and back up the best we could,

2306
02:33:57.481 --> 02:33:58.830
but this isn't an anomaly.

2307
02:33:59.850 --> 02:34:03.550
This isn't those story of the singular hero.
Right?

2308
02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:08.130
This is the story of thousands and thousands of heroes and this is the story of

2309
02:34:08.131 --> 02:34:12.480
what people are capable of.
People are capable of this proven.
Yeah,

2310
02:34:12.690 --> 02:34:16.410
and when you think you can't take any more,
guess what you can.

2311
02:34:16.810 --> 02:34:19.990
<v 5>Yeah.
Amazing meal.</v>

2312
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:26.020
Well,
if I got dysentery,

2313
02:34:26.021 --> 02:34:30.100
I wouldn't get out of bed straight up.
Don't let alone all this other stuff.

2314
02:34:31.150 --> 02:34:33.670
Yeah.
I'm in bed.
Maybe I'd go to the hospital or something like that,

2315
02:34:33.671 --> 02:34:35.260
but then my point hospital,

2316
02:34:35.530 --> 02:34:40.530
even echo Charles could employ the will in carry on when this tree.

2317
02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:45.340
Yeah,
with,
I even say he got malaria too,
by the way.
You know?

2318
02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:49.000
I thought it this friend,
he got it to his friend got malaria,

2319
02:34:49.001 --> 02:34:50.520
but he got rid of it to God.

2320
02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:53.350
That's when they went to look at his hernia and you're like,
hey,

2321
02:34:53.351 --> 02:34:54.910
you got to go back to front.
Oh,
but you got malaria.

2322
02:34:54.940 --> 02:34:58.420
Suffer through that for whatever it is.
Yeah.
That's four days.
Okay.

2323
02:34:58.421 --> 02:35:02.920
Now you can go back to,
okay,
you're good now.
Okay.
Okay.

2324
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:07.600
Guys are unbelievable.
All right,

2325
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:10.660
well I feel like we should talk about on it then.

2326
02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:15.310
That sounds like a great thing to talk about.
I'll let you talk about,

2327
02:35:15.311 --> 02:35:19.990
I'm going to sit over here and decompress will.
Okay.
So I'm,

2328
02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:23.410
I'm really glad and this kind of goes without saying,
but I'm going to say it.

2329
02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:27.210
I'm glad that we kind of got aligned with,

2330
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:29.470
I mean I already took shroom tech before this,

2331
02:35:29.471 --> 02:35:34.471
but actually I get technically it was you who really made me take Krill oil.

2332
02:35:35.100 --> 02:35:38.140
No,
I didn't make you think.
Yeah,
but you,

2333
02:35:38.170 --> 02:35:42.460
let's say you influenced me enough to actually take action as they say.

2334
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:46.850
But anyway.
Um,
so it's like Kinda,

2335
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:51.250
I compare like the post Krill oil and the pre krill oil situation.

2336
02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:53.253
So I was,
you know,

2337
02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:56.860
I was into lifting weights and stuff and you know how like weights is a good

2338
02:35:57.910 --> 02:36:01.810
kind of wheats is cool because you know how strong you are kind of thing.

2339
02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:04.180
You know there's the number one.
Yeah,
it's pretty black and white.

2340
02:36:04.181 --> 02:36:07.420
There's the number so you can kind of judge like yeah,

2341
02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:10.540
that guy strong or I'm stronger,
I'm not strong,
whatever.
Right.

2342
02:36:10.541 --> 02:36:15.280
So I considered myself pretty strong in the weight room.
But Kit is one time,

2343
02:36:15.281 --> 02:36:17.920
one of my,
one of our friends came into town.
We have,
you know,

2344
02:36:17.921 --> 02:36:22.240
we have the weights,
you know,
outside and stuff and they're like,
oh yeah,

2345
02:36:22.241 --> 02:36:26.590
you got the weights.
And um,
so he gets under there and he,
and he,
you know,

2346
02:36:26.591 --> 02:36:27.520
he grabs a weight,
not heavy,

2347
02:36:27.521 --> 02:36:31.690
but he grabs him and I'm thinking in my head like I can do way more than that.

2348
02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:35.970
But then I was like,
I can but I have to warm up a lot first.
You know,

2349
02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:39.640
cause it's a really,
how strong am I,
you know,
really.
Anyway,

2350
02:36:40.660 --> 02:36:44.110
the point there is that was pre krill oil.

2351
02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:47.830
I'm not saying I could jump underneath my Max,
no warm.
I'm not saying that,

2352
02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:52.860
but I'm saying like my actual strength is closer to my no non warmup strength.

2353
02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:57.010
No,
that's a good thing.
You ever,

2354
02:36:57.100 --> 02:37:01.800
you ever seen those videos where probably not,
but go ahead.

2355
02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:05.200
I don't know.
You may have heard,
you know,
the one where they,
they dress up the,

2356
02:37:05.201 --> 02:37:09.670
the young professional basketball player or something.
Um,

2357
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:14.680
oh to look like on,
you know,
an old,
an old man.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So there's this one,

2358
02:37:14.681 --> 02:37:16.040
it's like a,
I think he's like a

2359
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:18.980
pro crossfit guy or pro wait little limbic lifter or something.

2360
02:37:19.610 --> 02:37:23.810
So he goes to this beach is this old man and he's heard you guys are strong and

2361
02:37:23.811 --> 02:37:26.390
stuff like that.
I think you kind of over does it in my opinion with acting,

2362
02:37:26.391 --> 02:37:29.540
but whatever.
And everyone's believing like,
oh,
this old man,
you know,

2363
02:37:29.541 --> 02:37:32.330
you probably used to be a weightlifter and he,
um,

2364
02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:35.630
and he gets under the way and he's just killing it.
He's embarrassed.

2365
02:37:35.631 --> 02:37:38.750
He is just showing up all the guys beating him,
you know,

2366
02:37:38.751 --> 02:37:42.980
lifting more wasted than them and whatnot.
Um,
so then he kind of like,

2367
02:37:42.981 --> 02:37:47.780
does his old man walk away?
That's how I felt
before the Krill oil.

2368
02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:52.160
When it's time to live.
Like I can lift a lot,
but like my everyday life,

2369
02:37:52.161 --> 02:37:55.640
I'm like kind of stiff,
you know,
like,
oh,
I gotta get up after all,
you know,

2370
02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:02.150
that's it.
That's the Krill Krill oil comparison speech.

2371
02:38:02.151 --> 02:38:04.850
And where would you recommend people get the Krill oil that you speak of?

2372
02:38:04.851 --> 02:38:06.380
So highly anyway on it.

2373
02:38:08.190 --> 02:38:10.240
But he and I looked into that strong.

2374
02:38:10.310 --> 02:38:14.980
All my prompts lead towards closure.
Yes,

2375
02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:18.240
my goal.
No,
but I'm saying like,

2376
02:38:18.241 --> 02:38:21.180
you know how that's your goal,

2377
02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:25.400
care stories people want to hear about.
But I think when I,

2378
02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:27.320
when I saw those videos,
I was like,

2379
02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:31.520
that was me before crew or I really thought that like,
well,
that's how it feels,

2380
02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:34.280
you know,
kind of fight.
It's a funny video.
It's a funny thought even really.

2381
02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:37.010
But that's kind of how it feels.
But don't have that problem anymore.

2382
02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:38.870
I don't feel like that anymore.
So

2383
02:38:40.490 --> 02:38:43.940
if someone has seen that video and they might be feeling that that way,

2384
02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:48.320
maybe I can solve their pain.
I wish I knew that long time ago.
Anyway,

2385
02:38:48.810 --> 02:38:49.870
looked into strong boom.

2386
02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:52.940
I remember we were talking about it last week or whatever and I was like,
hey,

2387
02:38:52.941 --> 02:38:57.920
does it make your bones?
Yeah,
did it when I'm there on it,

2388
02:38:57.921 --> 02:39:01.340
very resourceful.
I'm a resourceful person on is a very good resource.

2389
02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:06.950
The website and the answer is yes,
it does.
Helps.

2390
02:39:06.951 --> 02:39:11.270
Like even like the onset of osteoporosis,
like all this stuff.
It's like that's,

2391
02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:16.190
that's what it's like.
Um,
I didn't memorize all the terms but I know the point,

2392
02:39:16.191 --> 02:39:20.900
but it's um,
oh yeah,
strontium and I liked the name it after.

2393
02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:22.550
Yes.
Cause strontium,
calcium,

2394
02:39:22.551 --> 02:39:25.820
all these things make it so when you get older and you know,
degeneration,

2395
02:39:25.821 --> 02:39:30.350
you lose that.
Yeah.
I'll eat in your natural deal,

2396
02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:33.950
you know,
maybe.
And you get the strong mom boom to him back in your bones.

2397
02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:37.100
Easy money.
So you'd take the Krill oil back in.

2398
02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:41.720
Your bones are back in your joints.
Will,
your joints are made up of your bones,

2399
02:39:41.721 --> 02:39:46.280
tendons,
ligaments.
Does it go into everything?
It goes into your bones,

2400
02:39:46.730 --> 02:39:51.010
so you figure the tendon connection to your bone.
That's,
that's the part that's,

2401
02:39:52.130 --> 02:39:55.800
yeah,
that can jam you up.
You get right on your bicep.
Yeah.
It happened.
Yeah,

2402
02:39:55.801 --> 02:40:00.050
that's what I heard.
Yeah.
I heard it one day.
It ripped off my bone,
my bicep,

2403
02:40:00.051 --> 02:40:04.640
wrist off mobile.
Anyway,
if I had some strong on that one,
that one happened,

2404
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:08.150
maybe it would have,
I don't know.
But nonetheless,
that is what strong bone helps.

2405
02:40:08.151 --> 02:40:12.290
So guess what?
I did.
Got some.
No worries.

2406
02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:18.090
Um,
but yeah,
there's,
there's not just that,
there's all kinds of cool stuff.
Uh,

2407
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:20.880
warrior bars.
That's another,
I have gotten more of those,
uh,

2408
02:40:20.930 --> 02:40:24.720
shroom tech for performance and the pro,
here's the thing.

2409
02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.950
I think sometimes people will kind of mistake the shroom tech when,
you know,

2410
02:40:28.951 --> 02:40:32.250
cause it helps your oxygen uptake.
They think that like,
I'm going to,

2411
02:40:32.610 --> 02:40:35.400
when I breathe,
it has something to do with your breathing,
you know,

2412
02:40:35.401 --> 02:40:37.320
it's not your breathing or your lungs.
It's the,

2413
02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:41.160
the amount of oxygen you take up when you breathe,
you know,

2414
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:44.550
so they can go to your muscles,
oxygen.
Anyway.
That's why it helps.

2415
02:40:44.551 --> 02:40:48.140
So if you go hard,
like super hard or uh,

2416
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:52.860
grappling long,
what you call them wads,
right.
We're out of the day.

2417
02:40:53.270 --> 02:40:57.580
Yeah.
Yeah.
It helps.
Keeps you out of the red.
Um,

2418
02:40:58.140 --> 02:41:00.730
but yeah,
go on there for whatever you do.
You know,
they,

2419
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:04.410
even a workout stuff and whatnot.
It's actually kind of a fun website.

2420
02:41:04.411 --> 02:41:06.690
You'd be on there for for a while.
Looking at the cool stuff.

2421
02:41:06.810 --> 02:41:08.730
That's my opinion and my experience.

2422
02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:14.370
Inner subscribe to the pot.
Actually,
you know what?

2423
02:41:14.371 --> 02:41:17.160
We'll talk about Amazon first,
so Amazon click through.

2424
02:41:17.161 --> 02:41:19.020
This is a good way to support podcasts.

2425
02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:22.710
What you do if you don't already

2426
02:41:24.810 --> 02:41:26.490
before you do your Amazon shopping,

2427
02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:31.520
go to Jocko podcast.com either on the tab on the top left in green on the top

2428
02:41:33.931 --> 02:41:34.764
menu

2429
02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:41.060
or on the side kind of towards the bottom is a place to click on just support

2430
02:41:41.310 --> 02:41:43.770
through either support Jacobite gas or Amazon.

2431
02:41:43.771 --> 02:41:46.530
Click through anyway before we do your Amazon shopping,
click through there.

2432
02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:47.760
Then do your shopping.

2433
02:41:49.860 --> 02:41:53.670
I actually did that the other day and I don't know if you're watching this on

2434
02:41:53.671 --> 02:41:56.070
youtube,
but if you are,
this is what I bought.

2435
02:41:59.710 --> 02:42:04.710
<v 2>Totally necessary and also also if you totally miss this book,</v>

2436
02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:07.180
I didn't,
I don't know if I made it clear enough.

2437
02:42:07.270 --> 02:42:12.270
The book that we read today is called helmet from my pillow by Robert.

2438
02:42:12.371 --> 02:42:16.120
Lucky.
You can get that Amazon,
you're going to put an echo.

2439
02:42:16.121 --> 02:42:18.910
We'll have it on the website.
And when you click that and you buy it,
boom,

2440
02:42:18.911 --> 02:42:21.280
you'll be good to go.
You will support the podcast,

2441
02:42:21.281 --> 02:42:26.281
you will support the lucky family in some way because there'll be somehow being

2442
02:42:27.071 --> 02:42:30.400
supported.
Right.
Cause their own,
I'm sure this book.

2443
02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.060
So it's a good way to support this hero,
this hero,

2444
02:42:34.061 --> 02:42:37.720
his family and also get the Pacific.

2445
02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:41.200
I don't know if we could put that,
I don't know.
But anyways,

2446
02:42:41.930 --> 02:42:46.150
like if you could put it on click through unless maybe someone bought the DVDs.

2447
02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:49.960
But we'll watch that and,
and you know what,
when you watch it,

2448
02:42:50.650 --> 02:42:54.760
like prep yourself mentally and don't watch it while there's other things going

2449
02:42:54.761 --> 02:42:58.570
on.
Sit down on a nice situation,

2450
02:42:58.870 --> 02:43:03.640
you know logistically with the good TV set and a good speaker,

2451
02:43:03.641 --> 02:43:08.020
system,
Thrones.
Yeah.
And then watch the Pacific and you only,

2452
02:43:08.450 --> 02:43:12.450
they're like,
maybe you can watch two at a time,
maybe what,
two episodes,

2453
02:43:12.460 --> 02:43:14.230
<v 5>two episodes.
But watch them close together too.</v>

2454
02:43:14.231 --> 02:43:17.130
So you kind of maintain the continuity of the situation.
Right.

2455
02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:19.810
Because that's good too.
And when you see it,
man,

2456
02:43:19.811 --> 02:43:24.340
it's just an incredibly well done thing.
Yeah,
it's awesome.

2457
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:28.510
And then when you have the background of the podcast of the books and you read

2458
02:43:28.511 --> 02:43:33.430
the books,
man,
it's really,
really powerful.
You actually get more more into it.

2459
02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:36.550
Oh,
for sure.
You know,
the guys know the story for sure.

2460
02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:40.040
You're more invested in the characters and you realize that,

2461
02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:43.210
that when you see lucky,
lucky in the thing,

2462
02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:47.680
you have his whole backstory of his life when you've read the book and it's

2463
02:43:47.681 --> 02:43:50.370
awesome,
you know?
Um,
by the way,

2464
02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:54.100
on the podcast website,
there's a whole section,

2465
02:43:54.130 --> 02:43:56.650
whole page with all the books of all the podcasts.

2466
02:43:57.730 --> 02:44:02.440
Make it easy for the book situation.
But yeah.
So yeah,

2467
02:44:02.441 --> 02:44:03.730
before you do your Amazon shopping,

2468
02:44:03.731 --> 02:44:07.600
click through the click through the Amazon link and then do your shopping.

2469
02:44:07.900 --> 02:44:12.100
And yes,
I did buy this item,
which I'm showing.
So if you look on youtube,

2470
02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:16.270
you can see it.
It's to add to our little collection on the table.
Yeah,

2471
02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:20.050
it's awesome.
So yeah,
speaking of Youtube,

2472
02:44:20.770 --> 02:44:23.080
we have a youtube channel.
It's good.

2473
02:44:24.490 --> 02:44:29.230
People have been telling me
for real,

2474
02:44:29.231 --> 02:44:32.470
people have been telling me,
not just one person,
but they say,
hey,

2475
02:44:32.471 --> 02:44:35.380
you should take,
because k on youtube channel we have the podcasts of course,

2476
02:44:35.381 --> 02:44:39.340
the video format excerpts,
just like,
you know,

2477
02:44:39.710 --> 02:44:42.100
excerpts from the Po sleek and like chairman,
stuff like that.

2478
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:45.310
And then there's like,
well what do you call them?

2479
02:44:45.311 --> 02:44:49.000
That what artistic pieces stuff that it puts some time into,

2480
02:44:49.001 --> 02:44:53.260
puts them track a soundtrack on Charles Videos.
That's true.

2481
02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:58.360
I just called it,
I forget what I called it,
like discipline something.
I Dunno.

2482
02:44:58.550 --> 02:45:02.720
So you made three categories or two to got to play it.

2483
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:04.720
So basically people didn't ask me,
hey,

2484
02:45:04.721 --> 02:45:06.880
you should separate them and make them into playlists,

2485
02:45:06.910 --> 02:45:08.080
which it kind of knew about.

2486
02:45:08.081 --> 02:45:13.010
But I'm not deep into the youtube thing where we know that well,
no,

2487
02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:16.000
as far as the customization and you know,
all of that,
which,

2488
02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:18.820
which I kind of looked into,
this is what I like about this.

2489
02:45:18.821 --> 02:45:23.050
As people gave you a suggestion,
which I saw to you,
you looked at it,

2490
02:45:23.170 --> 02:45:27.490
you explored it,
and now you executed on it.
Yeah,
totally.
Did kind of things.

2491
02:45:27.491 --> 02:45:30.640
Any other good ideas that people have,
they should post him.

2492
02:45:30.850 --> 02:45:34.300
And so that way you can improve even more and we can improve it and serve them

2493
02:45:34.301 --> 02:45:39.070
better.
Yeah,
I think so.
I think that's it.
And of course someone going to be like,

2494
02:45:39.071 --> 02:45:42.490
hey,
you know,
and they'll say an idea,
it might not be all that good,
but if,

2495
02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:44.710
or it may not seem like it's all that good,

2496
02:45:44.890 --> 02:45:48.220
but if another person says it kind of unrelated,
you know,

2497
02:45:48.250 --> 02:45:51.490
not the kind of words some guys or hey do this,
you know,

2498
02:45:51.491 --> 02:45:56.140
make this or create this and then someone just likes it or puts a light on it or

2499
02:45:56.141 --> 02:46:00.940
says yes,
you're asking for multiple,
well not to split hairs,

2500
02:46:00.941 --> 02:46:05.620
but I'm not asking for anything.
Oh,
I'm saying that's what you act on.
Yeah.

2501
02:46:05.621 --> 02:46:09.170
So if some someone says this suggestion,
maybe the next day,
two days,

2502
02:46:09.171 --> 02:46:11.360
three days later,
another person said the same suggestion,

2503
02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:15.560
suggestion unrelated and that 10 the,
you know,
the tendency,

2504
02:46:15.561 --> 02:46:19.210
I see a tendency coming up and that's when it started taking action.
As soon as,

2505
02:46:19.211 --> 02:46:23.450
hey,
what about the 14,000 I told you to make more videos.

2506
02:46:25.310 --> 02:46:28.560
Those are,
no,
because I was watching,
I realized it was watching so many,

2507
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:29.570
I can't even remember who it was,

2508
02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:32.780
but I was watching chunks of someone speak the other night,
someone that I was,

2509
02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:37.840
I don't know who was an and I was so happy that they weren't short clips and I

2510
02:46:38.001 --> 02:46:40.490
was like,
this is why we need more short clips.
Yeah,

2511
02:46:40.970 --> 02:46:44.000
because it's really convenient to go,
what's this idea here?
Boom.

2512
02:46:44.001 --> 02:46:45.680
You see the name of the video you go with.
Here's the idea.

2513
02:46:45.681 --> 02:46:47.990
I want to think about that idea.
Boom,
you're good to go.

2514
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:50.870
And Youtube is good like that.
Where if there's a bunch of them,

2515
02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:55.250
which I think we're kind of coming up with,
or collections kind of growing now,

2516
02:46:55.850 --> 02:46:59.390
I'd say there's a bunch of them.
How well did you execute when people said make,

2517
02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:03.770
when people were like episode 40 to make a video from this to this,

2518
02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:07.360
how did you do any of that?
Or did you bill everyone off?
No,
no,
no.
Yeah,
that's,

2519
02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:12.320
that's mainly what I base it on.
Oh,
okay.
Phil.
But those are,

2520
02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:13.610
they're everywhere,
you know?

2521
02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:18.680
So some of them don't quite translate.
Some of them,
I just,

2522
02:47:18.681 --> 02:47:22.130
I mean,
I don't want to upload like five in one day and the,

2523
02:47:22.131 --> 02:47:25.040
I've read some stuff that it's like,
I don't know.
It's not good to do that,

2524
02:47:25.041 --> 02:47:28.580
but I don't know.
That's a,
that's a long story.
I bet.
I don't know.
Let's not,

2525
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:31.840
let's not think about what's good to do and what's not good at it.

2526
02:47:31.850 --> 02:47:34.810
They're just got to get,
because you were trying to get,
so,
yeah,
you ain't to,

2527
02:47:34.970 --> 02:47:36.620
yeah,
I dig it,
man.
But yeah,

2528
02:47:36.621 --> 02:47:39.860
youtube is good like that where if you listen to just the,
um,

2529
02:47:39.890 --> 02:47:42.740
like an excerpt or just a clip,
two minutes,
three minutes,
four minutes,

2530
02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:45.650
and you're like,
Dang,
I want to,
I want to listen to some more.
They,

2531
02:47:45.651 --> 02:47:48.920
not only are they there to listen if you want,
but they'll suggest,

2532
02:47:49.010 --> 02:47:52.250
so you'll have a bit of continuity there instead of like,
oh,

2533
02:47:52.251 --> 02:47:55.580
I'm locked into this three hour thing.
And right now.
Well that's,

2534
02:47:55.581 --> 02:47:59.240
and that's one thing that's a little bit tricky about this is that when I,

2535
02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:01.460
when I'm thinking,
when I'm talking,

2536
02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:04.700
I'm thinking in the context of this giant two hour thing.

2537
02:48:04.730 --> 02:48:09.230
So sometimes it's hard to just snip out something and you lose a little bit in

2538
02:48:09.231 --> 02:48:10.064
my opinion.
Yeah.

2539
02:48:10.250 --> 02:48:14.600
But potentially you also gain a lot because you can get it quick and you can

2540
02:48:14.601 --> 02:48:18.800
share it with the next guy who's more likely or the next person more likely

2541
02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:23.880
listen to it because even now,
man,
people will send me,
you know,

2542
02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:28.280
whether it be funny videos,
there's this sodium video that you know,

2543
02:48:28.281 --> 02:48:31.490
the guy skipping a piece of sodium across the lake or awesome.
Yeah.

2544
02:48:31.491 --> 02:48:33.290
You saw that it's been going around.

2545
02:48:33.291 --> 02:48:37.130
I don't know if people look for it and then sent it to me or it's been going

2546
02:48:37.131 --> 02:48:41.450
around so now more people are sending it to me because the last like two weeks

2547
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:44.780
everyone's been sending it to me and I want to actually do that.

2548
02:48:44.781 --> 02:48:46.610
I want to get the sodium metal.

2549
02:48:46.611 --> 02:48:49.490
I don't want to throw it into the water at your house.

2550
02:48:49.970 --> 02:48:51.620
I do or if we can find it,

2551
02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:56.800
I want to do it and to burn and film it and then just see what else I got to

2552
02:48:57.130 --> 02:49:02.060
start looking for where to get some sort of metal,
you know?
Um,
but yeah,

2553
02:49:02.061 --> 02:49:04.910
that's the,
you know,
these are good things.

2554
02:49:04.911 --> 02:49:08.920
These youtube made the play list,

2555
02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:12.060
they're on their excerpts.
I'm putting more on there.

2556
02:49:13.650 --> 02:49:14.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2557
02:49:14.110 --> 02:49:14.943
<v 5>There it is.
Yep.</v>

2558
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:19.950
I'm subscribed on iTunes or stitcher or Google play and all the podcast

2559
02:49:20.770 --> 02:49:23.410
platforms.
Um,
you know,

2560
02:49:23.411 --> 02:49:27.430
that's a good way to support because you're essentially just kind of in the game

2561
02:49:27.940 --> 02:49:32.710
in general,
you know,
and that's really the thing because like the more people,

2562
02:49:33.250 --> 02:49:33.491
you know,

2563
02:49:33.491 --> 02:49:37.660
they'll hit us up on Twitter or just like kind of knowing and knowing what

2564
02:49:37.661 --> 02:49:40.900
you're talking about or submitting questions,
this kind of stuff.

2565
02:49:40.930 --> 02:49:45.190
It does make that circle of like,
it's not just Jocko telling us what to do.

2566
02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:49.320
It's kind of like we're all in this group,
you know?
Well yeah,
they weren't,

2567
02:49:49.321 --> 02:49:54.321
I ended up with like a common it like hanging out with your friends basically.

2568
02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:56.380
Yeah.
Like when I go on the road now,

2569
02:49:57.100 --> 02:50:00.640
like I was just out with some firefighters in,
in like we're all,

2570
02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:03.970
everyone's telling the same jokes,
but they're all,
yeah,

2571
02:50:04.270 --> 02:50:08.980
we all get it exactly right now with them because it's like as if they were
here.

2572
02:50:09.010 --> 02:50:11.860
Yeah.
And I was actually talking to them about that.
I'm like,
well,
you know,

2573
02:50:12.190 --> 02:50:15.250
w when it first happened,
it could be a little bit strange to me.
Right.

2574
02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:17.080
Cause you don't remember them sitting right.

2575
02:50:17.081 --> 02:50:19.300
Because no one was sitting there actually.
And I was like,

2576
02:50:19.301 --> 02:50:21.700
well sometimes it seemed like the podcast was like,

2577
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:25.600
was me an echo sitting in a room alone.
Right.
But then you realize,
no,

2578
02:50:25.601 --> 02:50:29.890
there's a lot of people sitting in here with us and they have their own spins.

2579
02:50:29.891 --> 02:50:34.270
This is what's funny is people have their own variations on the jokes and on the

2580
02:50:34.271 --> 02:50:37.440
inside things and on what we're talking about.
So it's all,
you know,

2581
02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:40.360
they've already taken stuff and spun it out somewhere.

2582
02:50:40.361 --> 02:50:44.430
Now they're bringing it back to me.
So I'm part of their right.
I get in,

2583
02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:47.410
get inside of their games.
So it's pretty funny.
Yeah.

2584
02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:50.220
And that's not to mention the questions that,
that you answer.

2585
02:50:50.221 --> 02:50:52.950
It's all everyone's question.
Yeah,
for sure.
It's not like you're like here,

2586
02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:56.800
let me think of this question that I think people I have no,

2587
02:50:57.040 --> 02:51:00.370
you got it from certain people and you know,
you answer them.
They're like hey,

2588
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:05.550
you know it's like a three way street or something better.

2589
02:51:05.651 --> 02:51:10.240
Anyway.
So yeah,
when you're,
when you're,
when you're,
I'm subscribed,
you're,

2590
02:51:10.241 --> 02:51:13.660
you know,
you're kind of in the group.
It's a good way to support.
I'm also,

2591
02:51:13.720 --> 02:51:15.520
Jack was a store called Jocko store.

2592
02:51:16.490 --> 02:51:16.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2593
02:51:16.930 --> 02:51:17.470
<v 5>Good story.</v>

2594
02:51:17.470 --> 02:51:21.310
Isn't it more like the podcast has a store cause I don't actually have a store.

2595
02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:24.580
It's the podcast has a story.
Yeah,

2596
02:51:24.581 --> 02:51:28.900
I guess technically we always make it sound like I have a store.
Yeah.

2597
02:51:28.901 --> 02:51:33.850
Cause it's called Junkie.
We the store.
It's got Jocko podcast starts.
Jocko store.

2598
02:51:34.010 --> 02:51:37.030
Go to the store chocolate store.
It's [inaudible] dot com okay.

2599
02:51:37.180 --> 02:51:40.810
See what I'm saying?
I'm going to concede to the point.
There it is.
Boom.

2600
02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:44.650
I have a story.
That's what I don't like about it and sounds good.

2601
02:51:44.651 --> 02:51:48.880
And so when I say it I think sounds cool.
Sure.
It's on there.

2602
02:51:49.450 --> 02:51:51.640
If you want to wear a t a t shirts and represent,

2603
02:51:53.430 --> 02:51:56.100
got a new design out there,
we'll kind of knew two weeks,

2604
02:51:56.101 --> 02:51:59.010
three weeks maybe I'll put it right.
Yeah.
Garden there.

2605
02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:01.450
And actually at the moment it's a new tee shirt,
design tee shirt.

2606
02:52:01.451 --> 02:52:06.370
Do you think it can be found in other places?
Okay.
Yeah,
right?

2607
02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:10.790
Sure.
What do you mean?
I mean all right,
right,
right.
Yeah.

2608
02:52:10.830 --> 02:52:13.150
Found in other places.
Yeah man,
it's good.

2609
02:52:13.390 --> 02:52:15.550
But hey look like on the get after it moves,

2610
02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:19.060
that's where it can be found straight up.
I don't know,
watch a little game here.

2611
02:52:19.061 --> 02:52:21.040
Like I wasn't gonna say anything.
It's the get after it mark,

2612
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:24.940
we've got a shirt that says get after it and now and came highly recommended.

2613
02:52:24.941 --> 02:52:29.550
Perfect.
Perfect example of people saying we're,
you know,
be what we're saying.

2614
02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:33.520
So like,
um,
like matter of fact is yeah.

2615
02:52:33.521 --> 02:52:36.130
Where it was to the point where they were like,
hey,
you should,

2616
02:52:36.370 --> 02:52:38.890
you should do it and get after it.
Sure.
They weren't saying that anymore.

2617
02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:41.530
They were saying,
when are they gonna get after it?
Shirts come out.

2618
02:52:41.531 --> 02:52:43.990
When do they come out?
Oh,
I didn't know what we're doing that yet,

2619
02:52:43.991 --> 02:52:45.730
but apparently we are so boom,

2620
02:52:45.731 --> 02:52:49.720
they're out and they got to with psychological work,
man,

2621
02:52:49.721 --> 02:52:52.000
I'm glad they did because I think they turned out good.

2622
02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:56.140
It will simple like most things.
Anyway,
these shirts are cool I think,

2623
02:52:56.380 --> 02:53:00.100
but go to [inaudible] dot com and look at them.
You think they're cool.

2624
02:53:00.101 --> 02:53:02.680
You think you want to wear one represent in the wild.

2625
02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:08.670
Go ahead.
Get one support one that way.
Also some,

2626
02:53:08.671 --> 02:53:13.530
you know some women's stuff out there.
Women might be underrepresented overall,

2627
02:53:13.710 --> 02:53:18.710
but I think that the women that are kind of in the game that listen,

2628
02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:23.360
that get after it,
they get after it.
Hard to make up for the numbers,
you know?

2629
02:53:23.410 --> 02:53:28.260
See what I'm saying?
Like the quality
greater than the quantity.
Anyway,

2630
02:53:28.290 --> 02:53:29.880
I've got some patches on there too.
The rash guards,

2631
02:53:29.881 --> 02:53:32.970
of course I'm going to put a new one out.
It's in the works.

2632
02:53:32.971 --> 02:53:37.620
It's like rit ready to be pushed out here in a few days.
I think maybe a week.

2633
02:53:38.700 --> 02:53:40.770
Um,
so yeah,
if you're into Jujitsu,

2634
02:53:41.370 --> 02:53:44.610
that's why I think that's the primary reason I made them.

2635
02:53:44.611 --> 02:53:46.860
But they're actually for surfing.

2636
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:48.130
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2637
02:53:48.130 --> 02:53:53.130
<v 5>Bodyboarding what Jocko calls sponging spot cycling,</v>

2638
02:53:53.820 --> 02:53:58.000
crossfit,
any kind of workout where you need,
you know,
like maximum mobility,

2639
02:53:58.001 --> 02:54:01.780
but you still want to go with like a shirt on.
Sometimes you just go no shirt.

2640
02:54:03.750 --> 02:54:08.460
But yeah,
go no shirt.
You're not supporting the podcast.
Correct.

2641
02:54:09.150 --> 02:54:12.630
Correct.
Uh,
and you know,
the,
we are,
I think,
you know,

2642
02:54:12.631 --> 02:54:15.690
we kind of did some calculations.
I think the new rash guard might,

2643
02:54:15.691 --> 02:54:17.670
I'm not saying it will,
cause we don't know yet.
They're not here.

2644
02:54:18.090 --> 02:54:21.570
They might yield,
was it 24?
Oh,

2645
02:54:21.660 --> 02:54:25.770
so echo did,
he's got the sample one,
the old one sample.

2646
02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:30.030
And the sample one you said gave you like 27%.

2647
02:54:30.170 --> 02:54:35.130
I thought 24 but you know what?
Now that you mentioned it,
I think it was 27 yeah.

2648
02:54:35.370 --> 02:54:39.210
Yes.
Up from 19.
Yeah.
Which is a lot,

2649
02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:41.760
but that's only one case study.
So that's what I'm saying.

2650
02:54:41.761 --> 02:54:45.750
We're really good at delegating blind tandem.
This is actually true.

2651
02:54:45.780 --> 02:54:48.000
Where I went and I practice.
I did some rounds.

2652
02:54:48.001 --> 02:54:49.310
And you're looking at when you're done rounding,

2653
02:54:49.350 --> 02:54:52.500
you're kind of talking with the boy's afterwards.
Yeah.
And girls in,
in our case,

2654
02:54:52.501 --> 02:54:55.890
because Haley was there too.
We're talking and I thought we were done.

2655
02:54:56.010 --> 02:54:57.690
We were done.
Somebody called me like,
hey guys.

2656
02:54:58.590 --> 02:55:03.090
And then David just means bullier.

2657
02:55:03.350 --> 02:55:08.150
He's like Ho nephew.
Like actually actual nephew,

2658
02:55:08.151 --> 02:55:11.690
like from like his dad's brother or something.
I might get that part wrong,

2659
02:55:11.691 --> 02:55:16.450
but it's,
yeah.
Anyway,
that's a side note.
Yeah.
Well he asks,

2660
02:55:16.470 --> 02:55:20.690
is anyone still rolling and go sweat stood around the left shroom tech rash

2661
02:55:20.691 --> 02:55:25.520
guard and I said,
yeah,
rolling.
Got It.
All with the lead.
Good,
good deal.

2662
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:29.720
Good experience.
But that's a good deep half guard.
Yeah,
his good deeds,

2663
02:55:30.290 --> 02:55:32.030
good brown belt.

2664
02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:37.160
All the respect by his deep half guard he's got,
because he's,
he's a bigger dude,

2665
02:55:37.161 --> 02:55:40.330
but he got to,
the deaf club card is bigger than Jeff Carson.

2666
02:55:40.340 --> 02:55:44.600
He left some trimmed up a little bit,
but nonetheless.
Yeah.
Good.
Good training.

2667
02:55:45.470 --> 02:55:50.150
Also psychological warfare.
So if you don't know what that is,

2668
02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:55.520
it's an album with tracks Jocko talking,
but he's not just talking.

2669
02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:00.470
He's talking with the intent of getting you through any moments of weakness that

2670
02:56:00.471 --> 02:56:05.350
you might have in your getting after it.
Journey isn't,

2671
02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:09.140
it goes beyond might have,
right.
It goes into actual moments of weakness,

2672
02:56:09.141 --> 02:56:11.630
not that you aren't in a moment of weakness,

2673
02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:14.630
you're looking at actual donuts there in front of you.

2674
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:18.400
They are breaking you down mentally,
boom,
click that,
hit play,

2675
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:23.180
get the track in there.
The actual amount of potential moment of weakness,

2676
02:56:23.181 --> 02:56:24.590
there's a moment of weakness is upon us.

2677
02:56:24.770 --> 02:56:29.770
We're going to feed it like a logical warfare and we're getting requests now for

2678
02:56:30.230 --> 02:56:33.740
the second one.
Yeah,
I'm going to start thinking about that.

2679
02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:35.210
What that's going to be like.
Yeah.

2680
02:56:35.260 --> 02:56:38.660
And if you want recommendations of what particular moments of weakness or you

2681
02:56:38.661 --> 02:56:42.800
might have that need to be overcome and there's a common theme as echo referred

2682
02:56:42.801 --> 02:56:46.940
to.
Sure we will.
And if it's gotta be something that I've dealt with before,

2683
02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:47.953
right?
Right.

2684
02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:53.120
Because I can't just make up some way of overcoming a weakness that I've never

2685
02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:56.150
experienced.
Now I've experienced a lot of weaknesses,

2686
02:56:56.690 --> 02:56:59.040
but if you come up with something that I've never experienced,

2687
02:56:59.041 --> 02:57:02.000
then we're going to have to just forego that one cause I'm not gonna make it up

2688
02:57:02.001 --> 02:57:04.970
for,
I'm not going to make up for sobriety.
Might not work.
Right.

2689
02:57:04.971 --> 02:57:06.480
It's hard to manufacture.
You know,

2690
02:57:06.650 --> 02:57:11.630
you can't manufacture Inspirado as the great tenacious d said.

2691
02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:14.720
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that's a good idea.
I got some,

2692
02:57:15.170 --> 02:57:18.410
we'll talk about it comes from a quietude.
That's where it's got to come from.

2693
02:57:18.510 --> 02:57:22.750
Sure.
I still get quiet,
dude.
That's a d.
Well,
yeah,

2694
02:57:22.850 --> 02:57:27.590
that's a good on psychological warfare,
Jocko Willink,
iTunes,
Amazon music,

2695
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:32.350
all those good.
It's probably any music outlet.
A bunch of music outlets.
Yeah,

2696
02:57:32.570 --> 02:57:36.560
just jump on that.
It helps,
man.
I eat and I use it.
I don't recommend this,

2697
02:57:36.561 --> 02:57:40.280
but I used it when I was like,
yeah,
I don't feel like working out.

2698
02:57:40.281 --> 02:57:43.070
This is a big thing for me because I kind of had it like that where I'll be
like,

2699
02:57:43.071 --> 02:57:45.350
oh I'm just going to rest because I don't feel like it.

2700
02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:48.630
I didn't get nine hours of sleep socks do it tomorrow.
No.

2701
02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:53.820
Yeah man.
So,
and it really worked with that.
The workout one.
A guy.
Yeah.

2702
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:57.790
You said it works 100% of the time.
Yes.
Like to wake up one.
Yeah.

2703
02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:02.310
Cause there's all,
you wake up tracks.
A guy on Twitter said a number

2704
02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:05.100
<v 0>awake of tracking didn't work.
It failed.</v>

2705
02:58:06.210 --> 02:58:09.320
And then he said,
but I made it to the number two wake up,

2706
02:58:09.460 --> 02:58:10.710
which isn't the way they're set.

2707
02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:13.950
They're set like you listen to one that's going to get you up if it doesn't

2708
02:58:13.951 --> 02:58:16.740
number two's waiting and you've got the number two and then he woke up.

2709
02:58:16.741 --> 02:58:21.660
So we're still batting a thousand overall.
Yeah,
the overall campaign.

2710
02:58:21.661 --> 02:58:23.850
Right.
But yeah,
the campaign is a wind.
But we did,

2711
02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.810
we did take a digger from one dude that just didn't get out of bed after

2712
02:58:27.811 --> 02:58:30.090
listening to psychological warfare.
Get out of bed track.

2713
02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:34.590
The one he had to go to track two but were there,
he had some reserves,

2714
02:58:34.610 --> 02:58:39.540
got some backup.
I don't think anyone's made it to three yet.

2715
02:58:39.900 --> 02:58:42.180
No one's made it to the wakeup track for you haven't been there yet.

2716
02:58:42.210 --> 02:58:45.480
That must make it even to make it the tee.
You must be one tire dude.

2717
02:58:45.570 --> 02:58:49.290
Once I had like a hard night before.

2718
02:58:49.980 --> 02:58:51.800
You must have a hard workout waiting for your son.

2719
02:58:51.801 --> 02:58:54.330
I don't know something but yeah,
my experience,

2720
02:58:54.331 --> 02:58:56.340
hundred percent success rate but I,

2721
02:58:56.530 --> 02:59:01.080
and then I started doing it just cause just cause I want to get flustered and no

2722
02:59:01.081 --> 02:59:04.530
reason.
Yeah.
And it's weird because it's not tropical row row.

2723
02:59:04.531 --> 02:59:07.650
We'll get cause you can,
it's not that,
it's,
it's almost like this.

2724
02:59:08.290 --> 02:59:11.640
Some people say to me,
Hey,
can you do one of you yelling?
I'm like,

2725
02:59:11.641 --> 02:59:16.210
well I don't really yell a lot man.
Like I didn't get,
I'm not a yeller now I,

2726
02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:17.220
let me see,
let me rephrase that.

2727
02:59:17.340 --> 02:59:21.720
If we're in the gym and like I'm pushing someone like an MMA fighter that's in a

2728
02:59:21.721 --> 02:59:24.660
workout,
I'm going to come on,
you know,
I might raise my voice a little bit,

2729
02:59:25.050 --> 02:59:27.870
but I'm not going to yell at you.
They Google,
you know,

2730
02:59:27.930 --> 02:59:32.370
the drill instructor type thing and it's not,
this is not what I do see.

2731
02:59:32.371 --> 02:59:35.370
Maybe like how that could be effective.
But in these cases,

2732
02:59:35.460 --> 02:59:36.930
that's not the mood you're in any way.

2733
02:59:37.590 --> 02:59:40.860
It could be effective for certain instances.
Yes.

2734
02:59:41.010 --> 02:59:45.440
And actually like I've been doing some little videos in the morning.
Oh.
And,

2735
02:59:45.570 --> 02:59:50.070
and I realized when I watch him that I'm getting a little bit aggressive with

2736
02:59:50.071 --> 02:59:52.980
the way I'm talking and it's not,
it's not like I'm saying,
okay,
I get it.
No,

2737
02:59:53.010 --> 02:59:55.910
I'm just starting to talk.
And then I start getting,
naturally,

2738
02:59:55.950 --> 02:59:59.880
I start escalating my own situation because I'm starting to think about when
I'm,

2739
03:00:00.090 --> 03:00:04.770
when I'm saying it means something to me.
So when I'm saying,
Hey,
you know,

2740
03:00:04.771 --> 03:00:05.850
you're wasting your life right now,

2741
03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:09.360
I start think of them that way because I know that there's someone that's

2742
03:00:09.540 --> 03:00:11.400
actually wasting their life right now.

2743
03:00:11.850 --> 03:00:16.850
And so it starts getting a little bit escalated and so maybe on psychological

2744
03:00:18.181 --> 03:00:22.680
warfare to there'll be some situation that s that I personally escalate on,

2745
03:00:22.910 --> 03:00:26.760
but yeah,
it would be natural,
right kind of thing.
Yeah,

2746
03:00:26.770 --> 03:00:31.590
because you can't manufacture Inspirado.
There you go.
But yeah,
it's good.

2747
03:00:31.940 --> 03:00:35.680
Like you just kind of explain like kind of the logic behind it,

2748
03:00:35.690 --> 03:00:37.700
like see what you're doing right now,
but do you see that in,

2749
03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:42.510
well I guess now I do shoot,
then you get up anyway.

2750
03:00:43.020 --> 03:00:46.030
Yeah,
I use the one that now,
sometimes I abuse it.
Well,
I don't know.

2751
03:00:46.031 --> 03:00:48.330
I'm feeling fired up and just put it in and get more fun.

2752
03:00:48.930 --> 03:00:50.970
Get talked into feeling even better.

2753
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:56.610
That's how dangerous state also when you're clicking through Amazon,

2754
03:00:56.611 --> 03:00:58.080
you can also get Jocko white tea,

2755
03:00:58.770 --> 03:01:03.550
which it may not seem like a big deal and maybe it isn't,

2756
03:01:03.580 --> 03:01:08.080
but maybe it is.
I tell Ya,
judging from some of the,

2757
03:01:09.010 --> 03:01:12.540
some of the reviews on Amazon,
I'm redoing.

2758
03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:14.710
After Drinking Jocko white tea,

2759
03:01:14.711 --> 03:01:18.610
I found I was overcome with the insurmountable urge to get after it,

2760
03:01:19.660 --> 03:01:24.660
so much so that I was able to defeat all my foes in a short amount of time.

2761
03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:27.220
On a side note,

2762
03:01:27.340 --> 03:01:30.850
I have found that Jocko white tea is best served over ice and consumed from the

2763
03:01:30.851 --> 03:01:35.020
skulls of dead enemies.
Now,
you know,

2764
03:01:35.021 --> 03:01:37.900
I don't know what situation this individuals in,
right,

2765
03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:40.240
but obviously he's in combat situation.

2766
03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:44.800
He's got photos that need to be killed and he's drinking from their skulls and

2767
03:01:44.801 --> 03:01:48.070
even in that really stressful environment,
you know,
the t's helping him,

2768
03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:49.570
which is cool.

2769
03:01:49.630 --> 03:01:53.260
I'm glad that it's helping him doing positive things against the enemies of,

2770
03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:57.580
of good in the world.
Also,
good evening echo and Jocko.

2771
03:01:57.581 --> 03:02:02.530
I woke up weighing 115 pounds of the day.
The white tea arrives two cups later.

2772
03:02:02.531 --> 03:02:05.410
I reward myself when I was now roughly 250 pounds,

2773
03:02:06.460 --> 03:02:11.200
so he more than doubled his body weight after two cups of Jocko white tea.

2774
03:02:12.010 --> 03:02:16.540
I think my team was a little loaded and obviously gave me more than the 20%

2775
03:02:16.570 --> 03:02:20.740
increase in gains that was promised and I don't think we actually promised

2776
03:02:20.741 --> 03:02:23.950
anything.
I didn't promise that,
but I think it kind of speaks for itself.

2777
03:02:25.300 --> 03:02:26.170
And this is the important,

2778
03:02:26.171 --> 03:02:28.660
this is why I wanted to make this one's very important.

2779
03:02:29.830 --> 03:02:34.830
Also cruising went up roughly 200% and so there's that as well for everybody,

2780
03:02:37.031 --> 03:02:39.340
you know?
And,
and there you go.

2781
03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:43.330
Scientific cruising is up 200% which is positive.

2782
03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:48.970
Also weigh the warrior kid.
I got the first hard coffee,

2783
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:52.870
I got it in my hands.
They sent me one,
they're sending me more,

2784
03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:57.880
but no,
Dang it's three hours right now.

2785
03:02:58.630 --> 03:03:01.690
We've been talking for three hours.
That's my fault.
Oh,

2786
03:03:02.650 --> 03:03:05.230
that's a long time.
And I was going to read a little excerpt

2787
03:03:07.090 --> 03:03:10.510
and I think I'm going to anyways,
it's already been three hours but,

2788
03:03:10.690 --> 03:03:15.430
but so
young mark is,

2789
03:03:16.390 --> 03:03:18.510
he's going to jump off this bridge.
He's,

2790
03:03:18.550 --> 03:03:20.980
he couldn't swim in the beginning of the book.
Now he knows how to swim.

2791
03:03:20.981 --> 03:03:25.120
But his goal is to jump off the bridge into the river and he's goes up there to

2792
03:03:25.121 --> 03:03:29.260
do it and he's scared.
He gets scared.
He's not going to feed,
just can't jump.

2793
03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:34.570
So uncle Jake,
who used to be a seal,
who's now with his young nephew,

2794
03:03:34.571 --> 03:03:38.470
tried to show him the warrior way,
goes up on the bridge and he said,

2795
03:03:38.471 --> 03:03:43.390
what's going on buddy?
He said,
in a calm voice.
I don't know.
I said,
I'm just,

2796
03:03:43.660 --> 03:03:46.870
I'm just,
you're afraid,
aren't you uncle Jake asked,

2797
03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:52.180
but he wasn't even asking.
He knew.
He knew I was scared.

2798
03:03:53.170 --> 03:03:57.890
There was no point in denying it.
Uncle Jake knew it as plain as day.

2799
03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:02.360
<v 2>Yes.
I finally said into quiet tone,</v>

2800
03:04:02.361 --> 03:04:06.860
too embarrassed that I was afraid.
Then to my surprise,
Uncle Jake said,

2801
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:10.890
that's normal.
What?
I responded,

2802
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:14.460
shocked it uncle Jake statement.
I said,
that's normal.

2803
03:04:15.540 --> 03:04:17.640
You're doing something you've never done before,

2804
03:04:17.700 --> 03:04:20.520
so it's normal to be a little hesitant.
It's called fear.

2805
03:04:21.810 --> 03:04:26.490
It's a normal emotion and it's okay.
Then he added,

2806
03:04:26.610 --> 03:04:29.160
well,
it's okay,
as long as you can control it.

2807
03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:32.520
This made no sense to me.

2808
03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:36.480
How am I supposed to control fear and how would you know you're not afraid of

2809
03:04:36.481 --> 03:04:40.740
anything?
Uncle Jake sat quietly for a minute.

2810
03:04:42.210 --> 03:04:44.970
Then he said,
I wish that were true.

2811
03:04:46.580 --> 03:04:49.400
What do you mean?
I asked him.
Well,

2812
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:54.020
you said I'm not afraid of anything and that is just not true.

2813
03:04:54.170 --> 03:04:57.470
Fear is normal.
In fact,
fear is good.

2814
03:04:58.310 --> 03:05:02.870
Fear is what warns you when things are dangerous.
Fear is what makes you prepare.

2815
03:05:02.990 --> 03:05:07.910
Fear keeps us out of a lot of trouble.
So there's nothing wrong with fear,

2816
03:05:09.470 --> 03:05:13.670
but fear can also be overwhelming.
It can be unreasonable.

2817
03:05:14.690 --> 03:05:17.900
It can cause you to freeze up and make bad decisions.

2818
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:20.300
Core hesitate when you need to act.

2819
03:05:22.130 --> 03:05:27.130
So you have to learn to control fear and that's what you need to do right now.

2820
03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:31.160
Okay,
that sounds great.

2821
03:05:31.161 --> 03:05:33.650
And I would really love to make you happy and overcome my fear.

2822
03:05:33.680 --> 03:05:37.940
But I don't know how
uncle Jake thought about that,

2823
03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:43.370
about what I had just said for a few seconds.
And then he said,

2824
03:05:43.610 --> 03:05:44.330
okay,

2825
03:05:44.330 --> 03:05:48.800
well the first part of controlling fear you have already done and that is

2826
03:05:48.950 --> 03:05:49.790
preparation.

2827
03:05:50.390 --> 03:05:55.100
You've done plenty of preparation to be ready for this moment to face this fear,

2828
03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:59.090
starting with dunking your head all the way up to swimming,

2829
03:05:59.091 --> 03:06:01.250
all around and back and forth across this river.

2830
03:06:01.340 --> 03:06:03.920
You have done little jumps off the river bank.

2831
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:08.060
All of the last several weeks have been preparing you for this,

2832
03:06:08.120 --> 03:06:13.120
this jump and all that preparation works to help overcome the fear.

2833
03:06:14.930 --> 03:06:18.230
Imagine how scared you would be if you still didn't know how to swim.

2834
03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:22.790
You'd be horrified,
but you have prepared.

2835
03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:27.140
Then why am I still scared?
I asked Uncle Jake simple.
He said,

2836
03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:30.710
because there's still an element of the unknown.

2837
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:34.430
You've never jumped off anything this high before so you don't know what it

2838
03:06:34.431 --> 03:06:35.300
feels like.

2839
03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:41.210
People are afraid of what they don't know or what they don't understand,

2840
03:06:41.390 --> 03:06:44.720
but you have prepared.
You know it is safe.

2841
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:46.400
You know you are ready.

2842
03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:51.640
It's just this last little bit of fear that has to be overcome and you know how

2843
03:06:51.771 --> 03:06:55.470
you do that.
I have no idea.
I him,

2844
03:06:56.520 --> 03:06:57.353
<v 4>you go,</v>

2845
03:06:58.840 --> 03:07:03.640
<v 0>just go.
I asked uncle Jake now partly thinking he was just joking.
Yes,</v>

2846
03:07:03.790 --> 03:07:06.580
you just go.
You see fear lives in the moment,

2847
03:07:06.790 --> 03:07:11.560
that powerful moment between when you decide you are going to do something and

2848
03:07:11.561 --> 03:07:15.280
when you do it.
Once you go,
once you start,

2849
03:07:15.281 --> 03:07:16.600
you won't be afraid anymore.

2850
03:07:16.660 --> 03:07:21.660
You overcome fear by going and it is the same in many aspects of life.

2851
03:07:22.751 --> 03:07:27.280
Parachuting,
talking in front of a crowd,
taking a task,
running a race,

2852
03:07:27.310 --> 03:07:30.700
competing in Jujitsu.
The fear is in the waiting,

2853
03:07:32.820 --> 03:07:34.980
so once you have planned,

2854
03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:38.760
once you have prepared and trained and studied,

2855
03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:40.980
there is only one thing left to do.

2856
03:07:42.260 --> 03:07:43.093
<v 4>Go</v>

2857
03:07:44.190 --> 03:07:46.860
<v 0>and that's it.
Yes,
that's it.</v>

2858
03:07:48.210 --> 03:07:53.190
As soon as uncle Jake finished those words,
he stood up,
looked at me,
yelled out,

2859
03:07:53.191 --> 03:07:55.080
who y'all?
And jumped off the bridge.

2860
03:07:56.060 --> 03:07:56.570
<v 4>Okay,</v>

2861
03:07:56.570 --> 03:07:59.570
<v 0>just go.
I thought to myself,
I stood up,</v>

2862
03:07:59.720 --> 03:08:03.470
stepped up onto the edge of the wall and look down at Uncle Jake who had just

2863
03:08:03.471 --> 03:08:07.100
come back to the surface and was looking up at me with a big smile on his face

2864
03:08:08.180 --> 03:08:09.830
with all my heart and lungs.

2865
03:08:09.980 --> 03:08:14.980
I yelled out who you are and stepped off the bridge past my fear and into the

2866
03:08:15.951 --> 03:08:16.784
unknown.

2867
03:08:17.780 --> 03:08:22.220
I felt myself falling for a while and didn't wash.
I was in the water.

2868
03:08:23.290 --> 03:08:23.650
<v 4>Okay?</v>

2869
03:08:23.650 --> 03:08:28.570
<v 0>I came to the surface and had a big smile on my face.
I can fly.</v>

2870
03:08:28.571 --> 03:08:33.460
I yelled,
I can fly.
So

2871
03:08:34.990 --> 03:08:38.830
little excerpt.
Dang those good man on the way of the warrior kid.

2872
03:08:39.130 --> 03:08:40.540
It comes out May 2nd.

2873
03:08:41.650 --> 03:08:44.830
So go and go.

2874
03:08:45.370 --> 03:08:49.480
Order the book for,
for you,
for your kid,
for your neighbor,

2875
03:08:49.481 --> 03:08:53.650
for your nephew,
for your niece,
for the school of library,

2876
03:08:53.760 --> 03:08:58.270
whoever ordered them.
So the publisher that's making this book,

2877
03:08:58.510 --> 03:09:01.030
we want them to know that they need to print a bunch of these,

2878
03:09:02.310 --> 03:09:03.143
<v 4>okay?</v>

2879
03:09:03.170 --> 03:09:04.190
<v 0>They don't know that right now.</v>

2880
03:09:04.910 --> 03:09:09.020
They don't know how many kids want to get after it.
You don't know that.

2881
03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:13.370
They don't know that and they're not going to print it off.

2882
03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:17.450
It's the same thing that happened with Jocko White Tea,
right?
You remember that?

2883
03:09:17.540 --> 03:09:21.290
That shortage,
the anger,
the frustration,
the nation wide,

2884
03:09:21.291 --> 03:09:24.560
19% drop in performance across the board of you.
Remember that?

2885
03:09:24.561 --> 03:09:27.950
Don't let it happen here.
Same thing.
You can order that.

2886
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:30.860
You can also preorder discipline equals freedom.

2887
03:09:30.890 --> 03:09:33.110
Field manual comes out October 17th

2888
03:09:33.860 --> 03:09:34.390
<v 4>okay.</v>

2889
03:09:34.390 --> 03:09:38.800
<v 0>1717
that's the book.</v>

2890
03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:41.080
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2891
03:09:41.080 --> 03:09:44.530
<v 0>that you asked for.
So you can order that one too.</v>

2892
03:09:44.531 --> 03:09:47.770
And of course extreme ownership.
You can get that one.

2893
03:09:47.950 --> 03:09:50.830
People buy it and then they buy it for their team and it spreads.

2894
03:09:50.831 --> 03:09:54.250
So pick that up for you and your team up and down the of command extreme

2895
03:09:54.251 --> 03:09:56.980
ownership.
Beyond that,

2896
03:09:57.070 --> 03:10:02.070
if you want some direct action and interaction with your company that you work

2897

2900
03:10:17.140 --> 03:10:18.610
Lastly,
if you don't know,

2901
03:10:18.611 --> 03:10:23.611
we have mustard zero zero two coming up at the Marriott Grand Marquis in New

JP,
Dave Burke,
and of course

2904
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:36.930
probably most important Echo Charles.
He's going to be there.
Yeah,

2905
03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:39.160
and he might try and hide,

2906
03:10:39.730 --> 03:10:43.030
but he can't because none of us can cause there's no green room,

2907
03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:44.110
there's no backstage,

2908
03:10:44.140 --> 03:10:48.610
there's just all of us together getting after it.

2909
03:10:49.240 --> 03:10:53.050
It,
of course before the muster you can find us.

2910
03:10:54.190 --> 03:10:58.480
We're cruising kind of hard on the interwebs,

2911
03:10:59.140 --> 03:11:01.930
on Twitter,
on Instagram,

2912
03:11:02.740 --> 03:11:05.020
and he ended up facey book

2913
03:11:07.150 --> 03:11:11.590
echo is that Echo Charles and I am at jockowillink

2914
03:11:13.090 --> 03:11:17.770
and finally,
thanks to all the service men and women out there who

2915
03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:22.240
in this uncertain world,

2916
03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:27.610
and it's certainly is an uncertain world today filled with evil.

2917
03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:33.220
All of you that walk away from the comforts of home and into the unknown

2918
03:11:35.140 --> 03:11:37.060
to face or enemies.

2919
03:11:38.610 --> 03:11:39.260
<v 4>Okay,</v>

2920
03:11:39.260 --> 03:11:43.250
<v 0>thank you.
Then to the firefighters,
police and law enforcement.</v>

2921
03:11:43.251 --> 03:11:46.400
EMT is in the force,
first responders here at home.

2922
03:11:46.401 --> 03:11:49.310
Thank you for what you do day in and day out.

2923
03:11:50.390 --> 03:11:53.600
Putting yourself at risk for us.

2924
03:11:54.740 --> 03:11:55.573
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2925
03:11:55.700 --> 03:12:00.700
<v 0>And to everyone else out there facing what you're facing,</v>

2926
03:12:02.750 --> 03:12:07.750
challenges at work and challenges with family and challenges with yourself and

2927
03:12:07.821 --> 03:12:11.360
challenges in your head and challenges with life.

2928
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:12.703
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2929
03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:19.760
<v 0>Remember what you as a human being are capable of.</v>

2930
03:12:20.251 --> 03:12:22.590
Remember what your will

2931
03:12:24.370 --> 03:12:25.380
is capable of

2932
03:12:28.010 --> 03:12:32.710
and then keep moving forward.

2933
03:12:34.090 --> 03:12:35.830
Keep attacking.

2934
03:12:38.110 --> 03:12:39.280
It keeps getting after it.

2935
03:12:42.380 --> 03:12:46.520
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2936
03:12:48.050 --> 03:12:48.320
out.
