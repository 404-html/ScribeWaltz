This is Jocko podcast number one 71 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.600
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.170
I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the

4
00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:22.070
United States against all enemies foreign and domestic,

5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.620
that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same and that I will obey the

6
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:29.990
orders of the president of the United States.

7
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.170
And the orders of the officers appointed over me according to the regulations

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.300
and the uniform code of military justice.

9
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.550
So help me God.

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.980
And that is the oath of enlistment that is made by every u s military member.

11
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.323
<v 1>Right.</v>

12
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.940
<v 0>And the other day I was at a charity event for America's Mighty Warriors,</v>

13
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:05.761
which is an organization that was created by Mrs Debbie.

14
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.990
Mama Lee,

15
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.490
the mother of Mark Lee from task unit bruiser,

16
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.630
who was the first seal killed in action in Iraq.

17
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.260
And it was a great event and it was an honor to be there.

18
00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:25.261
And I spent some time answering questions from some of the people that had come

19
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:27.221
out to the event.

20
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:32.221
And one of the individuals asked a question about the fact that he had served in

21
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:38.371
the marines during the 90s during a time of peace.

22
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.720
And he didn't go into combat and he didn't go to war.

23
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:45.370
And he actually felt guilty about that.

24
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.240
He felt that he hadn't done enough.
And I told him the truth.

25
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:55.241
And the truth is that he had done what his country had asked him to do.

26
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.333
<v 0>That's what he'd done.</v>

28
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.260
And if the country had needed him to give more than he would have given more,

29
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.890
that is what the oath of enlistment is.

30
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:09.650
And it's one of,

31
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.070
if not the most powerful oath that a person can give.

32
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:18.020
Because when you take that oath,
if you take that oath,

33
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.060
you are putting your country above all else.

34
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.880
<v 1>Okay?</v>

35
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.650
<v 0>Above your family,
above your future,
above your life,
above yourself.</v>

36
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.110
And with that oath,
when you take that oath,

37
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.790
if your country needs you to sacrifice,
you will sacrifice.

38
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:43.330
And if the country needs your time,
you will give it your time.

39
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.160
And if it needs even more than that,
then you will give it even more.

40
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.850
And the good soldier,
sailor,

41
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.320
airman or marine,

42
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.160
the service men and women who defend this nation,

43
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.490
they will sacrifice and they will give until they have nothing left.

44
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.820
And it is my honor tonight to have someone on the podcast that has sacrificed

45
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.700
incredibly for our great nation and yet his attitude remains completely

46
00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:22.950
unwavering.

47
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.120
He drives on and sets an example

48
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.693
<v 1>for everyone.</v>

49
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.710
<v 0>Then example of pure fortitude and tenacity and one that fully represents the</v>

50
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:43.230
motto of the Hallowed Brotherhood he will always be a part of.

51
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.190
And that's the United States Marine Corps and they're proud.

52
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.330
Maxim semper Fidelis,
always faithful,

53
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.730
been working to make this podcast happen for a long time.

54
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.840
And tonight I am grateful to have this hero with us,

55
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:04.290
a man by the name of Matthew Bradford.

56
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.213
<v 1>Matt,</v>

57
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.270
<v 2>welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me on Jocko.
This is a,</v>

58
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.230
it's something else to be sitting in front of you right now cause it's been a

59
00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:17.220
lot of remarkable people that's been on this podcast and it's a true honor to be

60
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:19.980

61
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.220
<v 0>Yeah.
And I know we've been working on making this happen for a while,</v>

62
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.250
so I'm glad we finally were able to get you and your family on a plane flown out

63
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:30.460
here where we can,

64
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.980
we can sit down and talk for a little bit and then you can get back with your

65
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.510
family and go have some good times.

66
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.880
<v 2>Go swim in the pool and spend,
spend the week at the happiest place.</v>

67
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.520
<v 0>Yes,
indeed.</v>

68
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.800
And it sounds like you're going to have good temperatures are giving you a

69
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:47.640
little heads up.
It can be a little warm here in Anaheim if you're not careful.

70
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:51.510
If you come out here in the summertime,
you,
uh,
you'll,

71
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.860
you'll get baked out there in the,
in the d,
in the,
in the Disney land,

72
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.410
<v 2>not a pasty white skin.
And I'm hardheaded,
so I don't like putting sunscreen on.</v>

73
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:02.610
So I learned the hard way.

74
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.080
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
hopefully you guys be all right.
Um,
all right,
so let's just go,</v>

75
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.970
let's go to the beginning.
Growing up,

76
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.930
what that was like growing up in Kentucky and Virginia.

77
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.640
What was that all about?

78
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.330
<v 2>I was born in Petersburg,
Virginia.
My Dad,
he worked at Fort Lee,</v>

79
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.090
at the defense commissary agency and you know,

80
00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:25.190
at an early age my parents got a divorce.

81
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:28.580
So I moved to live with my mom and Kentucky where all of my family's from.

82
00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:31.220
And even today when people ask me where I'm from,

83
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.930
Kentucky is just easiest to answer.
And you know,
throughout my childhood,

84
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.440
like we moved so much,
I learned a lot because my mom,

85
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.570
she worked paycheck to paycheck.
So I learned a lot about,
you know,

86
00:05:44.571 --> 00:05:48.500
how to appreciate things and to be thankful for things and not expect the bigger

87
00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:50.120
things.
And um,
you know,

88
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:55.121
through this I learned to just go outside and be with my friends and never

89
00:05:55.191 --> 00:05:58.670
expect,
you know,
a big Christmas what I knew one thing from,

90
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.330
from my mom and my stepdad.
And even my family around me,

91
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.480
the one thing they showed me and the rest of the,
our was love and it,

92
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:11.360
it taught me a lot about life at an early age.
And you know,

93
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:14.900
it's,
it's through all the moving around.
But you know,
in Kentucky,

94
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.010
the one thing with Kentucky is they,
they have a lot of their drug problems.

95
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.510
So it's getting out,
playing sports and getting away from that helped out a lot.

96
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.740
And you know,

97
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:29.741
all of this happened in 2001 and that's when I realized as a ninth grade in,

98
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.580
as a freshman in high school is when I felt like it was my purpose to serve this

99
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.220
country in the military.
Even though I was a freshman in high school,

100
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.980
sitting there watching,
you know,
the,
the,

101
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.920
the terrorist attacks go on in New York City and the Pentagon.

102
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:47.540
And I felt like it was my time go home and nobody was on the streets.

103
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.330
Nobody was playing basketball or football or whatever the sport or the,

104
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.570
the Tom was.
Everybody was inside watching the news.

105
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.450
And also through that,
you know,
my wife,

106
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.220
my mom and my stepdad was going through some things as their own and,

107
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.330
and uh,
that's when,
thankfully my dad stepped in and my dad said,

108
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.800
you're coming to live with me now.

109
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.190
And that was the greatest decision ever because although I love Kentucky,

110
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.040
I don't know where I'd be at the day if,
if he,

111
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:14.820
if my dad didn't step in and you know,

112
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.860
pull me towards him and Virginia and moving to Virginia after my freshman year

113
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:21.620
in high school and stay in there for three years,
you know,

114
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:25.010
living right next to a army base and visiting the army based daily,

115
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.370
I got to chance to see what,
what,
um,

116
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.050
what the willingness to serve,
you know,
the patriotism and all this stuff.

117
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:36.220
And it really kind of boosts it my,
um,

118
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.660
my motive to serve more and more.

119
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.570
<v 0>So when you were,
when you were in Kentucky and you are freshmen read,</v>

120
00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:46.600
you thought about the military prior to September 11th,

121
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.850
<v 2>growing up in Kentucky,</v>

122
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.030
the only thing that I wanted to do was play basketball for the university,

123
00:07:51.031 --> 00:07:54.600
Kentucky.
That is,
I think that's the one thing.
And um,
you know,

124
00:07:54.601 --> 00:07:57.840
you'd go out on the street or you'd play video games,

125
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.290
which then was the old school playstation and you just wanted to play basketball

126
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:05.820
for Kentucky.
There was nothing else.
And 2001 happened.

127
00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:08.910
And that's when kind of like the,
it got in my mind,
that's why I wanted to do.

128
00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:12.090
And then during that time Black Hawk down come out as the movie.

129
00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:15.270
And I just watched that over and over again and I was like,

130
00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:17.880
I want to be a ranger,
I want to serve,
you know then,

131
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.040
and then it went from the army too.

132
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.260
I looked into the air force special forces and their,

133
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.260
their special forces is way too long cause I want it to deploy.

134
00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:28.980
And I actually ran into the Marine Corps recruiter at Fort Lee playing

135
00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:33.981
basketball and he took us to Hooters and that's where he sold me was a Hooters

136
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:34.824
and

137
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.720
<v 0>oh that's uh,
that's good.
I guess it doesn't,
it doesn't take,
you know,</v>

138
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:45.440
for me when,
when the Marine Corps recruiting is awesome.
And I,
I,

139
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.790
I heard this fact a long time ago that the Marine Corps spends the least amount

140
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:53.791
of money on recruiting but has the best results because they just have their,

141
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.920
well they have marine corps,
they have the Marine Corps persona behind him,
the,

142
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.760
the legend of the Marine Corps.
And that I remember,
you know,
when I was a kid,

143
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.400
there was a guy that I knew that was a drill instructor and he would,

144
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.140
he was older than me,
but you know,

145
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:09.690
occasionally he'd come home and I would just think,

146
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:13.110
well obviously that's what I'm going to do.
There's no doubt in your mind,

147
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:13.411
you know,

148
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:18.411
you just see these human beings that are above and beyond anything you've ever

149
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:21.060
really seen before.
And you go,
that's,
you know,

150
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:24.840
when you're 10 years old and you see a Marine Corps drill instructor,
that's,

151
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:29.820
if that's a damn impressive site,
that is an impressive sight.

152
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.140
<v 2>Especially when you see the dress blues walk into the cafeteria at school and</v>

153
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.530
with all the metals and the red bands and it's like this is what I want it to
be.

154
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.370
And,
and cause growing up,
like on my mom's side,

155
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.750
my grandpa served and,
and then on my dad's side,
a lot of his family,

156
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.610
a lot of that family served in the military.

157
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:49.940
And I never realized the military was,
you know,
in my future.

158
00:09:49.941 --> 00:09:53.090
But looking back on it now,
because I've been asked this question,
if you've ever,

159
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.770
if you just think it's,
you know,

160
00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:57.820
it was set up for you to join the military and as,

161
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.250
as many people in my family that served,
I kind of,
you know,

162
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.940
to answer the question now,
I thought it was my time to serve.
And,

163
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.020
but I mean just the Marine Corps alone,
it's,
you know,

164
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:12.680
it wasn't my first choice because I just wanted to serve.
But I tell you what,

165
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:15.740
it's,
it's,
it was the greatest decision I ever made my life as an 18 year old,

166
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.880
you know,

167
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.480
December of my senior year in high school going to the MEP station and you know,

168
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:25.481
taking that oath and getting the date to go to bootcamp to recruit training.

169
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.260
And all I had to do was just give my recruiter my diploma and get on a bus and

170
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:33.710
there I go.
And surprisingly,
the first day of school,

171
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.160
the next year is when I was on a bus stepping on those yellow footprints and

172
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.053
getting screamed at.

173
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.670
<v 0>So you decided you were going to join after September 11th,</v>

174
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.110
and that was your freshman year.

175
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.640
Then you go from Kentucky to Virginia and,

176
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.140
but you're,
are you focused the whole time now you're just saying,
Yup,

177
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.460
I'm going in the military as soon as I get done with high school.
That's,

178
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.660
that's where your mindset was?

179
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.760
<v 2>That was,
I was,
uh,
I,
I,
my grades were bare minimum,</v>

180
00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:02.930
the average just to stay on a sports team and because all I knew was to,

181
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.500
my recruiter needed my diploma.
That was it.
And believe me,

182
00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:09.350
there was some classes that I struggled with and I didn't know if I was going to

183
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:14.060
give him that diploma or not,
but mainly English second semester,
my senior year.

184
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.320
That was a,
but it was,
uh,
it was my mindset.
That's what I wanted to do.

185
00:11:18.321 --> 00:11:20.240
I didn't think anything about going to college.

186
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.770
I just wanted to serve in the military.

187
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.510
<v 0>Yeah,
that's,
there's something
I dunno.
You know,</v>

188
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.080
I got,
I got a bunch of teenage kids.

189
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.350
I got two daughters and one son that are teenagers.

190
00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:34.720
All right now and then I got a little girl.
But

191
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.480
for kids these days,

192
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.620
a lot of them are programmed that what you do when you get done with high school

193
00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:46.000
as you go to college and the syntax is not for everybody.
It really isn't.

194
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.320
And for me it certainly wasn't.
It's something I want her to go.
I was like,
oh,

195
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.243
I do.

196
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.070
I wish I could have joined the military when I was like 13 B because I would

197
00:11:56.071 --> 00:12:00.490
have just been such a much better person,
you know?
So.

198
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.590
All right.

199
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.490
<v 2>You,
you struggle a little bit in school,</v>

200
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.650
in English apparently.
What sports did you play?

201
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.640
I played football.

202
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.820
I played basketball a little bit and I pretty much played all sports.

203
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.240
Not for school related,
but little league baseball.

204
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.220
And then my wife likes to make fun of me,

205
00:12:20.221 --> 00:12:22.770
but I played high school tennis from Sophomore to senior year.
And

206
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.730
I went out there the first practice,

207
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.840
my buddy that kind of like recruited me to come play.
And the coach was like,
hey,

208
00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:32.810
how about you to just go down there and play a bunch of sophomore?

209
00:12:32.811 --> 00:12:36.330
It's just kind of get it out of our way.
And I beat him.
Ain't nothing.

210
00:12:36.331 --> 00:12:40.490
He got so mad.
It was so funny.
And like walking or walking her down,

211
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.650
I'm walking back to the other side of the courts and hearing the other players

212
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.830
like,
oh my gosh,
she just beat,
make nothing.

213
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.060
And the guy had red hair and his face was just as red as his hair.
And,
um,

214
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.620
what do you know?

215
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.620
Like I W I w I junior year I just the one seat on both singles and doubles and

216
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.360
went pretty far in the district.
And uh,
you know,

217
00:13:00.361 --> 00:13:02.940
senior year was the same and it was just something that I enjoyed to do in the

218
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.670
springtime.
And it was a,
and honestly it's very,

219
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.410
you run so much that you gotta be athletic and you gotta be in shape.

220
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.780
And that helped out a lot too,
you know,

221
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.540
football in the fall and then tennis in the spring.

222
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.000
And so what year did you graduate in?

223
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:23.010
2005 and then you left in September of 2005 you leave for boot camp?

224
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.610
I did,
Yep.
Graduated in June and left in September.

225
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:28.290
So a couple of months in between.
And,

226
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.960
and that's the one thing like in high school there was a couple of marines are a

227
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:35.940
couple of guys that I graduated with.

228
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.900
We graduated on Friday and they went to boot camp on Monday and they're the ones

229
00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:44.901
that kinda like Kinda kinda helped me kind of really realized that the Marine

230
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.050
Corps is what I wanted to do even though it's kind of what a was focused on.

231
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.780
When did you,
when did you sign a contract at BEPS?

232
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.490
December of 2004 okay.
So you had a little delayed entry,

233
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.950
delayed entry program,

234
00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.290
<v 0>worried about what they're going to do after high school and you're like,</v>

235
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.790
I'm going to party all summer long and then I'm going to Marine Corps boot camp.

236
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.750
How much of a shock to your system was it when you got some Marine Corps

237
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.060
<v 2>bootcamp?
The first three days was,
I mean it's,
it,</v>

238
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.910
it was just so much like,
you know,

239
00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:18.150
of course you don't sleep at all and it's just this constant yelling and you're

240
00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:20.100
realizing like what in the world did I do?

241
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.310
Cause you can only watch it on videos and understands like okay that's on a TV

242
00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:28.200
screen and it's not real life.
But it was something else getting,
you know,

243
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:32.760
I guess they arrange it up every,
every time the bus goes through Paris island,

244
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.460
they're going to stand on the yellow footprints in the middle of the night.

245
00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:38.580
And of course that's when we got off and I was,

246
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.680
it was a 12 passenger van and I was Kinda in the middle seat and I had to go

247
00:14:43.681 --> 00:14:46.110
through the seat belt to get out while I'm getting yelled at.

248
00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:49.260
So I'm like choking myself with a seatbelt and you know,

249
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:52.880
we get to the yellow footprints and it's like you're sending there and the

250
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.090
position of attention and it's like your calf started tightening up and you

251
00:14:56.091 --> 00:15:00.740
started just like,
oh my gosh,
what did I do?
Why did I sign this paperwork?

252
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:04.520
And I think the funniest thing was when we actually went on to Parris Island,

253
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.690
how this book,
this van from Virginia down to Parris Island,
eight hours,

254
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.190
just joking and talking.
The minute we pass the gate,
it just got silent,

255
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.960
like standby.
And there was,
you know,
and then you're going back like when I,

256
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.630
cause I turned 18 my senior year in August and I did delayed entry program or I,

257
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.170
you know,

258
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:28.040
went to meps December and when I would come home in December and my dad was
like,

259
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:31.970
so what'd you do?
And I was like,
I signed up for infantry in the Marine Corps.

260
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:35.300
And he was like,
you know what infantry does,
right?
And it's like,
I do,

261
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.010
and this is the time,
like in my room,

262
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:40.760
I had the big marine corps poster with the three marines.
And their dress blues.

263
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.360
I think it was the guy and the the female.
Yeah,
and it was like,

264
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.520
it took up the whole wall and I was,

265
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.870
I was dedicated to the core then and I was so excited to to raise my hand and

266
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:54.260
then go to school the next day.
We're in my meps marine corps tee shirt.

267
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.600
I was like,
this is it.
I'm hard to recruit,
you know,

268
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.920
started walking around with all the Marine Corps shirts.

269
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:04.300
I'd go to the mall and I'd walk around my shoulders all cocked back and it's

270
00:16:04.301 --> 00:16:08.810
like,
this is it.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
I was trying to,

271
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.490
cause there's been quite a few people that have joined the military from

272
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:16.820
listening to the podcast and now whenever I talk about this,

273
00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:20.190
I always try and tell them that for at least the first two weeks they're going

274
00:16:20.191 --> 00:16:23.050
to hate me.
They're going to hate the military.
They're going to,

275
00:16:23.051 --> 00:16:26.320
a boot camp is going to seem like the worst decision they ever made.
That was a,

276
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.340
I actually was speaking on the USS George Washington in Japan in 2009 and this

277
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.190
sailor walked up to me.
He's like,
oh,

278
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:36.590
I just got off the phone with my dad and tell him I'm reenlisting after hearing

279
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:38.930
you speak.
And I'm like,
oh gosh,
you didn't give him my name.
Did you

280
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.880
check?
So,
uh,

281
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.320
you go through boot camp and you get done and you knew your infantry the whole

282
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:52.790
time,
right?
I did.
I knew I was infantry and you know,
in 2005,

283
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.460
like I feel like we had about 70,

284
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:59.900
75 recruits in our platoon and majority of them were going to infantry.

285
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:05.300
And the funny thing is sitting in our squad bay and our senior drill instructor,

286
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.320
he was,

287
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.800
he was sitting in front of us talking to us up on the quarter deck and he's
like,

288
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:13.520
I got one more class after you all.
And then once I'm,
once I'm done,

289
00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:18.380
I'm going to Hawaii and I'll never see you little your little pukes again and,

290
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.440
and you kind of just like blow that off.
It's like,
okay,
cool.
He's going to,

291
00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:23.430
why I'm more than likely at East Coast Marine.

292
00:17:23.431 --> 00:17:27.740
So I'm going to say it can't blow June and do my time there and hopefully never

293
00:17:27.741 --> 00:17:28.371
run into him.

294
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:33.371
But then you experience the small Marine Corps gets a lot smaller and um,

295
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.640
you know,
once we got to Soi,
graduated from there and,

296
00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:42.210
and they told us that a select few of us from Alpha Company School of infantry

297
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:45.020
would be going to Hawaii,
be station was second time,

298
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:48.380
third marines and a select few of us was our whole company and the company to

299
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.550
next the company.
So they,
they dropped us off in Hawaii.

300
00:17:52.551 --> 00:17:54.450
And you go through there and is that

301
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.540
<v 0>normal for like a whole company from Soi to go together to a battalion</v>

302
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:00.624
somewhere?

303
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.530
<v 2>I didn't think so at the,
I thought,
you know,</v>

304
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.910
you know in the Marine Corps it's like east of the Mississippi,

305
00:18:04.911 --> 00:18:07.290
you're pretty much going to stay all together.

306
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.880
But I thought they would kind of disperse you out through different battalions

307
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.130
and um,
thankfully to everybody,

308
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.460
like a lot of the guys that I went to boot camp with was in the same battalion

309
00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:17.330
as me in Hawaii.

310
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.260
So like I create that friendship and that Brotherhood from the start of the

311
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.540
Marine Corps and carried it with me along the way.
And,

312
00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.260
and I was glad because you know,
it's grown up in Kentucky and Virginia.

313
00:18:27.261 --> 00:18:31.460
I didn't want to be stationed in Laguna or the east coast and they gave me this

314
00:18:31.461 --> 00:18:33.530
little wishlist,
which I don't think they even look at it.

315
00:18:33.531 --> 00:18:37.750
I think he's give it to you cause it's checking the box.
But yeah,
I picked,

316
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.790
I picked oak and down can't Pendleton as my first two choices and they pretty

317
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:42.050
much put me right in the middle.

318
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.850
Always tell people a free government trip to Hawaii.

319
00:18:46.851 --> 00:18:50.960
I mean I can't complain about that at all.
So how was the school of Infantry?

320
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.860
It was cold in North Carolina.
We were during that time,

321
00:18:54.861 --> 00:18:58.850
there were so many guys going through the through infantry school and a lot of

322
00:18:58.851 --> 00:19:03.530
guys were just like there for a couple months,
three months.
And um,
you know,

323
00:19:03.531 --> 00:19:06.830
like you go to the Chow Hall and you got to like a 10 to 20,

324
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.870
like a snake line of rows and rows of marines going trips,
trying to eat chow.

325
00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:15.800
And I was so close to actually call my recruiter to go on recruiting assistance

326
00:19:15.801 --> 00:19:18.530
because I didn't know how much longer I'd be here.

327
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.980
And thankfully my last name starts with a B.
And so,

328
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.850
so January I got selected and put an Alpha company.

329
00:19:25.851 --> 00:19:29.210
And the first three weeks is just kind of learning the whole weapon systems and

330
00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:31.440
working on,
you know,
going on humps and stuff.
And,

331
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.360
and then the next three weeks was basically out in the field the whole time

332
00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:37.100
doing infantry work and clarity,
you know,

333
00:19:37.101 --> 00:19:41.350
learn how to clear rooms and do a lot of mount training.
And at this point

334
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.790
<v 0>you're,
did you guys all pretty much assume you're going to Iraq or Afghanistan?</v>

335
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.860
100%.
I mean,
being an infantry man in the marine corps,

336
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.070
there's a war in two countries.
You,

337
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.960
you must have all just realized you're 100% going

338
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.120
<v 2>pretty much.
And,</v>

339
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.110
and that's the reason why I wanted to choose infantry cause I wanted to blow it

340
00:19:58.111 --> 00:20:01.260
as quickly as I possibly could.
And uh,
you know,

341
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:03.990
two of my drill instructors were purple heart recipients from the battle of

342
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:06.660
Fallujah.
And um,
so it's like you Kinda,

343
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.300
you kinda hear it from all the drill instructors when you're going through

344
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:12.120
recruit training that you know,
this is where you're going to end up.
You know,

345
00:20:12.121 --> 00:20:13.980
you go through your school and you go through your training,

346
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:18.180
but more than likely 99% of you are going to Iraq or Afghanistan.

347
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.200
<v 0>Were you thinking about that?
Like you're on the range,</v>

348
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.690
you're dialing in your weapon.
Are you thinking yourself,

349
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.720
I better pay attention right now because I might be needing this skill in a

350
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.363
couple months when I'm overseas,

351
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.560
<v 2>I don't think it ever like cross my mind because I just did what I was told to</v>

352
00:20:35.561 --> 00:20:37.870
do.
You know?
And you know,

353
00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:40.890
when it was on the rifle range or if it was like patrolling,
you know,

354
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.570
I tried to take in as much as I possibly could and learn as I went.
And you know,

355
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:47.710
the,
the more I learned,
I,
you know,

356
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:51.850
I learned to not only teach myself but also teach those around me and stuff

357
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:55.420
because I didn't,
you know,
you only see it on the news.

358
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:58.000
You don't really know what to experience.
And it's,

359
00:20:58.001 --> 00:20:59.530
it's funny because I tried to read the book,

360
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:03.820
No true glory and I couldn't really understand what Iraq was like,

361
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.560
you know,
from clearing rooms are patrolling down the streets,
urban terrain.

362
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:11.710
I couldn't understand that because I wasn't there.
And you know,

363
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.580
of course now when I read these books I understand because I can visualize it in

364
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:17.590
my head,
but you know,

365
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.580
then I was just doing what I was told and I was learning as I went along.

366
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.030
And I,
you know,
I learned what I could through school of Infantry.

367
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:27.850
And then once I got to the fleet it kind of changed a lot because we've had to

368
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:30.170
learn what the,
with our battalion and,

369
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.920
and our squad and platoon was doing there

370
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.320
<v 0>at the school of Infantry.</v>

371
00:21:34.321 --> 00:21:38.460
Did you do company sized operations of bill,

372
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.480
like clearances of villages and stuff like that?
We

373
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.350
<v 2>we did towards the end of school of Infantry.
We had um,</v>

374
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.470
we had all the eleven's out there and then we had the machine gunners in the

375
00:21:49.471 --> 00:21:53.520
mortar man would set up and,
and we kind of,
um,
we would,

376
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.860
we would Humvee in and you know,

377
00:21:55.861 --> 00:21:58.560
we'd go in and clear a couple of homes and stuff like that.
And,

378
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.360
but it was more of a company level.
It's hard.

379
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.100
It's hard to remember back then what it was.

380
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.250
Cause it was the one thing in like North Carolina,

381
00:22:07.251 --> 00:22:10.350
like where we were at trying for school of Infantry,

382
00:22:10.351 --> 00:22:14.580
which is a lot of like machine gun fields and a lot of like pop up targets and

383
00:22:14.581 --> 00:22:15.480
those kinds of ranges.

384
00:22:15.481 --> 00:22:19.020
And then the mount town wasn't as extensive as it was once we got to the fleet

385
00:22:19.021 --> 00:22:20.520
and went to cacs in California.

386
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.870
<v 0>So you would say at school of infantry you are more working on your individuals</v>

387
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.560
infantry skills more than like working together with a platoon or a company size

388
00:22:30.561 --> 00:22:31.394
to elements?

389
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.840
<v 2>I think so because a lot of times at school of imagery we did a lot of fire team</v>

390
00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:37.510
stuff and um,
you know,
we did a lot of hikes every,

391
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.340
every Thursday once we got back from the field.

392
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:41.230
But a lot of it was like this learn weapons,

393
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.540
learning how to shoot at pop up targets and like moving targets and just Kinda,

394
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.610
um,
like learn,
just kind of learn the whole weapons,

395
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.710
weapons and systems and stuff.

396
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.030
<v 0>Every marine is first and foremost a rifleman and that,</v>

397
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.570
and that's where you become a rifleman.
Okay.

398
00:22:57.571 --> 00:23:02.520
So now you get assigned to two,
three marines and you're,

399
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.810
you're heading off to Hawaii,

400
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.840
which is really just coming from coming from Kentucky and in Virginia and then

401
00:23:10.531 --> 00:23:13.380
North Carolina.
And now all of a sudden you wake up,
you're in Hawaii.

402
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.300
<v 2>We were actually in the squad bay,
me,</v>

403
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.260
a guy from Georgia and the other guy from Tennessee and we were listening to

404
00:23:19.261 --> 00:23:22.650
Craig Morgan's redneck yacht club thinking this is what we're going to do when

405
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:24.990
we get to the why.
And of course all,

406
00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:26.760
I think all three of us were in different companies,

407
00:23:26.761 --> 00:23:29.310
so we never saw each other once we got to y.

408
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.530
But you like you fly in and you get there and it's like,

409
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.260
oh my gosh,
we're in Hawaii and we,
we get on the bus,

410
00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:41.340
we get all our gear and we get dropped off at the battalion office and we got

411
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.070
two of my seniors waiting on me and he's like,

412
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.620
they're basically pulling me to the bearish just so it's like you're all ours

413
00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:52.940
now.
It's like,
oh gosh.
And then you know,
you start hearing stories from like,

414
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:57.890
other than the other guys that got there with me and how they're,

415
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:01.330
they're seniors or um,
you know,
well call me.
No Man to the,

416
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.000
the platoon w what,
what month did you get there?

417
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.340
March,
March of 2006.
Okay.

418
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.190
And so that as soon as you get there and those guys were just coming back from

419
00:24:13.191 --> 00:24:14.910
Afghanistan,
right?
They were,
they,

420
00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:19.280
they were actually over there during operation red wing and um,
yeah,
they were,

421
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:23.630
I think they get back February of 2006 so they were just getting back from their

422
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:27.230
post deployment leave and um,
you know,
once,

423
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:29.361
once we got there,

424
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:33.300
it was pretty much you got to get right into another workup and,

425
00:24:33.301 --> 00:24:38.301
and then that workup is where you really start integrating everyone together,

426
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:42.500
working in platoon size elements,
working in company size elements.
It was,

427
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:45.410
and then that's when we kind of,
they told us when we first got there,

428
00:24:45.411 --> 00:24:46.850
everything you learned in school of Infantry,

429
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:51.440
just like lose it because now you're going to learn what we teach you and you

430
00:24:51.441 --> 00:24:51.651
know,

431
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:55.430
from everything from just like clearing conference rooms and barracks were in

432
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:59.260
just to,
you know,
working on patrolling up the streets in Hawaii.

433
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.550
And that was the one bad thing about being stationed in Hawaii.

434
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.940
That's a great place to be.
[inaudible] but there wasn't much to do any training.

435
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.260
And we would,
um,
I mean Lou would literally patrol up and down the streets at kb,

436
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.640
Connie Lee Bay,
Hawaii,
and they had a couple of old barracks that we work mounts,

437
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.470
you know,
we do mount training with and what's Sim rounds and um,
you know,
we do,

438
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:19.460
we'd be able to bellows,

439
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.670
which was like a little air force base that they were starting to create like a

440
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:23.301
mountain town.

441
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:26.540
And that's when we did a lot of our training and kind of our field work.

442
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.320
And now at this point are you starting to think and you got guys that are just

443
00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:34.340
coming back from Afghanistan,
are you starting to think like,
okay,

444
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:36.110
now I really need to do start paying attention.

445
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.750
The reason I'm asking you these questions is because I'm trying to relate.

446
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.700
We know when I joined the navy,
it was 1990.
There was like,

447
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.930
I guess the Gulf War was kind of on the horizon,
but,

448
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.680
and it was gone so quick with that.
By the time I was in buds,

449
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:52.670
it was a over [inaudible].
And so even when I was doing workups and stuff,

450
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:56.600
like I would always be thinking
like,
okay,

451
00:25:56.601 --> 00:26:01.601
I need to be good at this because some day I might need this skill,

452
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.940
but that's a big stretch,
you know what I mean?

453
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.250
Whereas once September 11th happened,

454
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.270
every one of these young guys that was coming in,
it was like,
oh,
I'm probably,

455
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:13.550
it wasn't like some day I might need this skill was like,

456
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.780
I'm probably going to need this skill in the next couple months to save my life

457
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:18.620
or my friend's lives.

458
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.720
Did you feel like that kind of intensity from yourself and from the other guys

459
00:26:23.721 --> 00:26:25.160
that were just coming back from overseas?

460
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.930
I think so because I feel like the way they were,
um,

461
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.390
kind of instructing us and teaching us this stuff and they kept relaying that

462
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:35.450
any minute now that we could be called up and deployed.

463
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.610
And you started getting more serious about it.

464
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:42.611
And I think my attitude changed and it wasn't more of like joking around,

465
00:26:42.861 --> 00:26:45.960
even though I like to joke a lot,
but it was when it's time to be serious,

466
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:49.470
it's time to be serious.
And it's time to learn,
you know,
and you know,

467
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:53.880
whatever weapons I was carrying around,
if it's a or the,
the,
um,
the rifle,

468
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:58.620
the m 16,
you need to learn everything about that and you need to learn it too.

469
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:02.100
It's t and I think that's the one thing that I really paid more attention about

470
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:03.780
and,
and it's,
um,

471
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.860
but it was just like you could feel it from your seniors because they

472
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:11.490
experienced like casually as they experienced deaths over in Afghanistan,

473
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:14.820
they knew what combat was like and you started understanding that this is

474
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:17.670
serious.
Now this thing,
you know,
the sign of video game or a joke,

475
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.860
you're getting ready to go to war and you know,
five,
six,

476
00:27:19.861 --> 00:27:22.350
seven months or even tomorrow,
you never know.

477
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:26.520
And so everything that you need to learn here is something that you need to take

478
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:28.140
serious because this is,
you could be,

479
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.870
have yourself in this situation when you're in combat.

480
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.740
<v 0>At what point did you know where you were deploying to that you were deploying</v>

481
00:27:34.741 --> 00:27:35.574
to Iraq?

482
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.660
<v 2>I felt like it was after cacs and July we were in,</v>

483
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.620
we were in kayaks from June to July of 2006,
which is great.

484
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:47.460
Wants to be in the deserts in California.
But I feel like once we got back there,

485
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:50.700
it was pretty much like we're going to our rack and,
and that was so,

486
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:54.900
so we're still in is this Oh,
fibro six oh six.
Okay,
got it.
Yeah.

487
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:59.730
Join join September,
2005 and I was on a plane in September,
2006.

488
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:01.710
I had a towel rack.
So that's,
uh,

489
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.780
one of the things I want to do in the Marine Corps.
As I mentioned,

490
00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.350
it was just I wanted to deploy and I was literally in the Marine Corps a year

491
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.270
and I was already on a plane headed overseas

492
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:13.240
<v 0>and then did well what point did you know you were where an Iraqi we're going,</v>

493
00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:15.560
that you were heading up to [inaudible]?
I think we,

494
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.180
<v 2>we knew we were going through the Al Anbar in the Northwestern part of our app,</v>

495
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:20.910
but we were never told what city.

496
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.390
I think once we got to al-Assad and we were starting to relieve three three in

497
00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:28.320
here about like what they went through and where they were at is when we started

498
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:30.420
really realizing,
okay,
this is where we're going.

499
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.130
<v 0>So it was when you actually got to,
you got in countries when you realized,</v>

500
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:38.110
okay we're going to [inaudible] you knew that you were going to relieve three,

501
00:28:38.111 --> 00:28:42.270
three,
you probably heard a bunch of the stories and I mean,
so this is,

502
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.480
so I was in,
I was in Ramadi at this time,
um,

503
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:50.080
you know from the Spring of Oh six until the fall of [inaudible].

504
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.790
So you're,
we overlapped probably by about a month,

505
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.650
maybe a little bit more of when you arrived in Iraq and you flew in Dallas audio

506
00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.360
said

507
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.710
<v 2>flu analysis side and we were there basically a day and then while we were in</v>

508
00:29:02.711 --> 00:29:06.560
hour saw,
three,
three was starting to pull some of their marines out.

509
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.320
And that's when we started interacting with them.

510
00:29:09.321 --> 00:29:12.590
And they told us that they felt bad from what we were getting ready to get

511
00:29:12.591 --> 00:29:16.080
involved.
They lost so many marines while they were over there.
And,

512
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.080
and then it's just kind of like,

513
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.860
you hear stories of other guys in our company,

514
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:26.090
like basically in a firefight just to get on their fob.
And you know,

515
00:29:26.091 --> 00:29:28.320
once we left al-Assad,
we,
we took 'em,

516
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:32.270
we flew up to the head Etha dam and middle of the night and stayed there

517
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:35.380
overnight.
We started loading our mags and we got in a big convoy and we,

518
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.840
we drove into it either and it was um,

519
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.060
I mean he uses like you hear the,

520
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.540
of a diva from three three and then when three one went through their stint

521
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:50.410
before and it's just wild,
wild west.

522
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.720
And again,
you only see it on TV.

523
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:55.420
You never expect to be walking the same streets and you know,

524
00:29:55.421 --> 00:30:00.250
this stuff going on.
But they know the first time we went out on patrol it was,

525
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.100
it was nerve wracking.
It was not like,

526
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.110
cause it's like you do this and training so much and you feel like you do it so

527
00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:08.670
well.
But now that you're in a situation where it's like,
oh gosh,
you know,

528
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.230
I've got to look here.
I've got to look here.
I got to look up,
I got to look down.

529
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.710
And what was your position in the platoon that was appointment has a,

530
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.360
and then it was,
uh,
it was fun.
You know,
as a,

531
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.500
I think after the first fire fight is when you're like,
you kind of like,
okay,

532
00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:27.300
I could do this.
This is good.
I'm motivated now.
You know?
And,
and I was that guy.

533
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:31.540
Remember one,
one time we got in a firefight.
And,
um,
before we went on patrol,

534
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:34.900
I was like,
Gosh,
I'm ready to get some,
I'm ready to get a firefight,
you know?
And,

535
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.970
and I didn't know my squad leader heard this,

536
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:39.850
but after we got into like a two or three hour long firefight,

537
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:43.660
we're walking back onto the fob and he yells at me,
Bretford I'm like,
what?

538
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:46.480
He's like,
I'm gonna kill you.
Like,
what did I do now?
You know,

539
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:49.240
it's like we all come back alive.
You know?
I feel like that was a good thing,

540
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:53.350
but it was,
uh,
you know,
it's,
it's funny,
the first firefight we got into,

541
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.100
we were in the palm groves and we're walking along this compound wall and these,

542
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.870
these little trees there,
there are no bigger than there are no water,

543
00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:04.810
then a softball.
And then there was one,
no water,

544
00:31:04.811 --> 00:31:07.540
then a baseball and they open up from our left.

545
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.600
And so me and my team leader jumped behind the one that's the size of a softball

546
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.450
and he's like,
Hey Bretford get over there by that tree.
And I'm like,
well crap,

547
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:20.440
that one's smaller than this one,
you know?
And,
and then our Corman,
who was a,

548
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.110
he was a,
is a junior core man.

549
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:26.920
He had the shotgun for breaching and he laid off around and I don't,

550
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.150
I'm pretty sure he didn't hit the guy,
but the boom scared him and he took off.

551
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:34.570
And,
but it was just a,
and of course the same day in the marine corps,

552
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:36.670
it's just a,
our comms went out.

553
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:40.300
And so the stuff that we got was kind of crap.

554
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:44.080
So it's like here we are in the middle of the palm groves after a fire fight and

555
00:31:44.081 --> 00:31:45.040
we don't have no cons,

556
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:48.910
were shooting up smoke and trying to get somebody to come down there and help
us,

557
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.870
you know.
And so what was,
where were you guys living in?
Had Ethan,

558
00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:56.060
there was a fog in the middle of the town that we were,
um,

559
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.770
we say that that was our home and it was right in the Iraqis houses.

560
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:00.860
And was it a,

561
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.760
was it a platoon size element in there or a company size element of there?

562
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.000
It was a company the way that,
um,
our battalion was split up,

563
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:10.770
the battalion commander and the headquarters was much more in the dam,
the dam.

564
00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.220
And then Adita was the main EO because there's a larger city and that's where

565
00:32:15.221 --> 00:32:18.380
our company was echo company.
And we had,
um,

566
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.340
we had golf company to the south of us in Hawk Linea.

567
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:24.100
And then across the river in Botswana was Fox company.
And,

568
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:29.170
and weapons company would basically go from,
from,
from Aota at Eo.

569
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.230
And about three months into the deployment,

570
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:36.010
our battalion commander and the headquarters detachment would come and they

571
00:32:36.011 --> 00:32:40.160
actually set up shop and [inaudible] with us once the Iraqi police,

572
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.690
Iraqi army left our fob.
And um,
you know,
we had,
uh,

573
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.980
we,
yeah,
there was,
it was a company element and we pretty much ran,
you know,

574
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.140
the fourth platoon would work more with the Iraqi police,
Iraqi army.

575
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:58.010
And then the one platoon was basically set up for mobile and the other tunes

576
00:32:58.011 --> 00:33:01.520
would rotate back and forth between posts and patrol.
So it was,

577
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.090
I forget how many days on we would be off on posts duty and then it just kind of

578
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:07.930
rotate back and forth.
And when we were in a,

579
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.320
at our mobile unit got hit so hard that they had to change out.
And,
uh,

580
00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.460
another platoon had to take over just because of the,

581
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:20.300
the snipers that indirects,
Ids,
just,
we lost so many guys.

582
00:33:20.301 --> 00:33:23.660
And throughout that whole deployment,
the whole battalion lost 23 marines.

583
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:27.820
And I think echo company lost non marines.
And,
um,

584
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.840
the majority I think,
uh,

585
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.800
I think all of them were within the first two or three months.

586
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.250
Not to mention the purple heart recipients that we got from that deployment.

587
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.870
<v 0>And when you were,
were you guys doing,</v>

588
00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.570
most of you guys are doing almost all foot patrol out of the fog.

589
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.990
<v 2>I wish we were a foot patrol,</v>

590
00:33:43.991 --> 00:33:47.320
every patrol and I actually felt safer walking the streets and I did in the

591
00:33:47.321 --> 00:33:48.550
vehicle and um,

592
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.110
I mean we'd get in the back of a seven ton and they're launching grenades or the

593
00:33:53.111 --> 00:33:55.750
seven ton trying to blow us up.
Then you know,

594
00:33:55.751 --> 00:33:59.560
the one time that we were in a patrol with the Iraqi army,
we were in the old,

595
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.730
old green Humvees with no up armor and me and my friend was sitting in the back

596
00:34:03.731 --> 00:34:05.860
seat was like good luck.
I love you brother.

597
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.790
Cause cause if this something happens right now,
then we're,
we're screwed.

598
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.790
<v 0>Yeah,
the old Humvees aren't going to take an ID.
I hit very well.</v>

599
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.070
<v 2>No,
not at all.
And it was like I,</v>

600
00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.660
I love being over there.
You know,

601
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:24.080
we talking about serving this country and you know,

602
00:34:24.081 --> 00:34:25.460
the one time that were in our rack,

603
00:34:25.461 --> 00:34:28.310
it's like we had one big screen TV in our Chow Hall,

604
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:29.390
but we were never in a chow hall.

605
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:32.030
We lived in an Iraqi house and it was just our platoon.

606
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:36.650
And you were away from the news.
You're away from society,
everything going on.

607
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:38.060
It was just you and your brothers.

608
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.240
And that's the one thing like today I miss more than anything.

609
00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:43.300
It's just being around those guys and you,

610
00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.760
you see them open up and you know when,
when you're,

611
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:50.420
when you're a marine brother,
you know,
gets killed or wounded.

612
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.830
Like you see the emotion that it's like you're there for him,
you know,

613
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:55.940
when he comes to you.

614
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.630
And those are the things that I miss more about the Marine Corps.

615
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:02.120
And unfortunately living in Kentucky today,

616
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:05.180
it's like you're not around the Marine Corps base and you're,
you know,

617
00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:07.880
I get to see my friends.
I Dunno,

618
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.940
once a year it seems like in a lot of the guys in my platoon,

619
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:12.470
I haven't even seen since my injury.

620
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.620
<v 0>The,
uh,
the,
well,
how long would you guys go on patrol for?</v>

621
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.080
Like what would you guys patrol for a couple hours?

622
00:35:20.081 --> 00:35:23.500
Would you guys find it objective and then head that way and then check it out?

623
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.430
Then come back.
Did you have an objective?
We just do an presence patrols.

624
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.930
What was that all about?

625
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.010
<v 2>We were doing a lot of meet and greets,
presence,
patrols,
id,
patrols.</v>

626
00:35:32.011 --> 00:35:36.630
We'd go off for two or three hours sometimes we'd actually go out and set up a

627
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:39.630
patrol in the middle of town and just stayed there for a couple of nights and

628
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.310
run patrols out of the patrol base.
Later on in the deployment,
our,
um,

629
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.000
our company commander kind of made it a,

630
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.800
an objective set up patrol basis throughout the town.
We had one in north,

631
00:35:50.801 --> 00:35:53.310
had Ethan one in south and then went out and kind of the,
um,

632
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.250
I guess that'd be the,
the western part of the data.
And um,

633
00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.280
which we'd basically,

634
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:02.580
we'd have engineers come in and they'd build like little little fobs out these

635
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:06.690
houses and actually spent Christmas at 2006 on that.

636
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.860
The patrol base up in North Edema and it was sitting there on the roof in the

637
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.640
middle of the night eating cold Turkey and ham,
you know,
and merry Christmas Bro.

638
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.510
And it's so funny because it's like they told us,
it was like,
oh,

639
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:21.090
you're going to have Christmas off.
Yeah.
Nah,

640
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.900
that didn't last very long because here we are on patrol going up to north of

641
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.990
[inaudible].
But it was,
uh,
it was fun.
I enjoyed it.
And you know,
one of the,

642
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.380
some of the cool things that we did there we were,
we had a,

643
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.880
they believed there was a cache and one of the islands and there was no bridge,

644
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:37.200
nothing to get to the island.

645
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.670
And the only way to get there was to take river rafts.
And I'm not going to lie,

646
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:44.940
that was the one time I felt like I was a navy seal going down either Fraser

647
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.140
River on a river raft.
And,
uh,

648
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.160
but it was in the middle of the night and they had a two 40 on the front of it

649
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:54.360
and they would pick us up from the bridge and we would ride up right to the,

650
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.910
that,
the,
um,
the island.

651
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.770
And we actually dug and dug in and stayed there overnight.

652
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:05.990
And I believe that was Thanksgiving of 2006 so I was happy holidays or the

653
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.171
holidays,
you know,

654
00:37:07.171 --> 00:37:10.050
so like looking back now on the holidays and Thanksgiving and Christmas,

655
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:12.450
it's like,
I just look back on those two moments of my life.

656
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:16.940
It's like sleeping on a cold island because people look at our rack and think

657
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:20.280
it's warm all the time,
but it's pretty cold over there in the winter months.

658
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.070
And then of course,
Christmas Thompson on the roof.

659
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.420
And how often were you guys getting indirect fire into your,
into your fob,

660
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.350
you guys with mortars?
A lot.
We got mortared about every,
every day,

661
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:35.910
about five o'clock,
you know,
child time.
And one of the times,
like we had a,

662
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.620
I dunno,
it was like a heel.

663
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.810
It was like a big sand hill in the middle of our farm.

664
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:43.470
And we had a couple of posts up on top of it and I was actually,

665
00:37:43.471 --> 00:37:46.500
we were on post duty and they was like Bretford once you bring these batteries

666
00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:48.330
up to post five,
which is at the end of it.

667
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:52.110
And so I take a battery to it and I'm walking down and like going down,

668
00:37:52.111 --> 00:37:56.010
this is very steep.
And while I'm halfway down,
they started dropping mortars,

669
00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:57.990
honest.
And it's like,
I'm thinking to myself,
it's like,

670
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.420
should I go back to the post or should I ruin?

671
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:02.460
And like I'd take all sprinting down the hill.

672
00:38:02.461 --> 00:38:05.760
Thankfully I didn't like roll all the way down and my team leader,

673
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:07.690
like when I run in that I was like,
where's Bradford?

674
00:38:07.691 --> 00:38:09.420
And I'm like sitting here like gasping for air,

675
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.800
but it's like spring it across the,
this,
you know,
down this big hill.
But um,

676
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:18.600
but yeah,
we got a,
we got mortared about every afternoon and,
and thankfully they,

677
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.020
their mortar salt because they missed.

678
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.800
And I'm one of the times we were actually very lucky.

679
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:27.090
We were in our fob,

680
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.140
we were in our house and we were all kicked back on our bunk beds.

681
00:38:31.141 --> 00:38:33.420
And my really good friend,

682
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:37.270
my best friend actually was working on the hot air tank or whatever it was

683
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:41.170
outside and they dropped them order like 30 feet behind our house.

684
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.060
And when that thing hit,

685
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.180
we just automatically went to our gear because it sounded like it went right

686
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:49.750
through the middle of our house and he ended up taking shrapnel in the leg.

687
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:53.770
And thankfully that was it.
And that's when I realized that,
you know,

688
00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:57.040
I had to have many friends that got killed when I was over there,
but I wasn't,

689
00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.400
you know,
right there listening to him scream as a paternity suit on.

690
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:04.720
And that's when I realized that this is real,
you know,
and I'll not only,

691
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.770
it's like,
yeah,
this guys like fighting to put a tourniquet on and,

692
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.300
and he's my best friend,

693
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:15.301
he was my roommate when I was in Hawaii and it really killed me thankfully,

694
00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:16.690
that he didn't lose a leg.

695
00:39:16.691 --> 00:39:19.810
He come back in a couple of weeks and he was sitting there showing his pieces of

696
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:23.080
shrapnel and tell him,
I said he went down to Alison and have some ice cream.

697
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:26.950
And it's like,
Eh,
you know,
forget the way I felt about it,
you know,
but,

698
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:31.630
but it's uh,
you know,
a lot of the,
a lot of the scary moments bring together the,

699
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.970
the true brothers,
you know,
and the fellowship.

700
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.190
<v 0>And then how long was it?</v>

701
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.880
Was it January is when you got injured?

702
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:47.470
<v 2>January 18 2007 and we were four months into a deployment.</v>

703
00:39:47.811 --> 00:39:49.790
We started kind of,
you know,

704
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.330
you could start here in a little scuttle butt about the ad von coming in.

705
00:39:53.331 --> 00:39:56.540
You know,
we're getting ready to start heading out and you know,
the,
the,

706
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.130
the other units coming in.

707
00:39:58.131 --> 00:40:01.990
And I actually was speaking to my uncle on the phone that day,
you know,

708
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.370
and we rarely get to call home.
And I was telling him,
I was like,

709
00:40:04.371 --> 00:40:06.950
can you know deployments going well,
you know,

710
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.710
they're starting to talk about other guys coming in,
you know,
and,

711
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:14.300
and hung up the phone because we had to go to a brief and the brief was the

712
00:40:14.301 --> 00:40:19.130
patrol.
And you know,
unfortunately I don't remembering at this part right here,

713
00:40:19.131 --> 00:40:22.070
I remember all the way up til like the last minute walking down the street.

714
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.580
And as I was walking point,
I look out in front of me,
you know,

715
00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:30.440
we're walking along a road alongside the parallel or you Fraser River is called

716
00:40:30.441 --> 00:40:31.130
park place.

717
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:34.550
And we were coming up past his compound wall and to this opening with a bunch of

718
00:40:34.551 --> 00:40:37.880
palm trees.
And I see a white bag leaned up against the palm tree,

719
00:40:37.881 --> 00:40:41.450
about 30 yards off to my right.
And as a,
you know,

720
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.360
like a little bit late was a suspicious item.

721
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:46.730
And I turn around and tell my team leader to my left and he was on the other

722
00:40:46.731 --> 00:40:49.130
side of the road and I turned around and tell everybody behind me.

723
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:52.070
And the minute I turned back around and I looked down and there was a stitched

724
00:40:52.071 --> 00:40:56.060
at ran perpendicular to the road and I see the wires going inside the pipe

725
00:40:56.061 --> 00:40:56.841
underneath the road.

726
00:40:56.841 --> 00:41:01.100
And I was standing right on top of the pipe and I mean in a matter of seconds it

727
00:41:01.101 --> 00:41:03.750
exploded.
And sending shrapnel in both my eyes and that,

728
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.060
that was the last thing I ever saw was at white bag and those wires.
And um,

729
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.351
you know,

730
00:41:09.351 --> 00:41:13.550
is this is laying there conscious like hearing everything going on around me,

731
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.660
my squad leader calling and QRF and you know,
just,

732
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.720
I actually had the,
the litter kit in my pack,

733
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.430
so it's like they had to figure that out.

734
00:41:22.431 --> 00:41:25.200
And then the whole time I was trying to stand up.
Do you know,

735
00:41:25.201 --> 00:41:28.880
I had my left leg was,
it was blown off.
Like I didn't have a left leg.

736
00:41:28.881 --> 00:41:32.120
My right leg was severely damaged and um,

737
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.790
but just felt like people always ask me like,

738
00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:36.620
what were you feeling when this was all going on?

739
00:41:36.621 --> 00:41:40.940
And it went so quick that I don't even think I had a chance to fill anything.

740
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.540
Like I literally went from like walking down the patrol,

741
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:48.260
seeing something suspicious to laying on the ground,
looking in darkness.

742
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:53.280
And I didn't know if that was it.
If I didn't know if I was dead and you know,

743
00:41:53.281 --> 00:41:54.770
it just hearing voices around me,

744
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:58.790
they put me in the kit and they take me into a compound and you know,

745
00:41:58.791 --> 00:42:03.020
as we're waiting on QRF to get there,
you know my buddy's look,

746
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.410
they're sitting there holding my hand talking to me because you know,

747
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.610
out of our squad,

748
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.930
we probably got into the most firefights out of our whole company,
but it was,

749
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:16.100
we left the fog with full marines.
We'd always come back with told marines.

750
00:42:16.101 --> 00:42:18.560
We let the enemy know that if you're going to mess with us,

751
00:42:18.561 --> 00:42:19.341
we're going to give you everything.

752
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:23.210
We've gotten more and this is the first time that we suffered any kind of

753
00:42:23.211 --> 00:42:26.570
casualty and lay in there like,
you know,

754
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:30.860
basically fighting for my life and they're holding my hands,
talking to them.

755
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:35.510
If they didn't think I would make it out of there.
And as QRF shows up,

756
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:39.500
they put me in the back of a Humvee.
And the last voice I heard was,

757
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.970
as I mentioned earlier,

758
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:44.960
the small Marine Corps was from my senior drill instructor who was a platoon

759
00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:49.370
sergeant in the same company said,
Bradford,
you'll be fine.
And then I passed out.

760
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.640
I didn't know if that was it.
I didn't know if I was truly dead.

761
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:54.560
Now that was the end.

762
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.220
I felt like I was only 20 years old and I felt like that was the end of my life.

763
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.420
And those are the last words I heard.
And um,
you know,

764
00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:06.410
I woke up three weeks later from a coma,
you know,

765
00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:11.411
and this is when I realized that what I truly love to do,

766
00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:15.800
that my true purpose in life was to serve this country,
wearing the uniform.

767
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.970
And it was taken from me.
Like here I am in the United States,

768
00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:22.430
while my brothers are over there in Iraq fighting right now,

769
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.240
I felt like a coward.
Like they would try to,

770
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.890
they would call me when they could and I wouldn't want to talk to him on the

771
00:43:27.891 --> 00:43:28.880
phone.
Like,

772
00:43:28.881 --> 00:43:32.180
I would always tell him what some kind of excuse that I'm sleeping or I'm doing

773
00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:34.790
something just so I didn't have to talk to him because I felt like I let them

774
00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:37.670
down and that it,
it killed me.

775
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.260
And then once,
once my dad told me that I lost my legs,

776
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.010
that was the worst thing in the world.
Then I just wanted to die.

777
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.430
I like the guilt to depression.

778
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:53.690
I didn't want to live a life anymore and I always,

779
00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.870
I always told him like when he told me that I was like,

780
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.600
I felt like my legs were like a Lizard's tail.
You know,

781
00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:02.330
it's like they'll grow back.
Like you see it on the news all the time,

782
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.110
but you never expect it to happen to yourself.
And here I am.

783
00:44:06.111 --> 00:44:10.820
I didn't care nothing about the vision.
I just wanted my legs back cause it was,

784
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.720
it was tough those first two or three weeks after getting out of ICU.

785
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:17.030
Like I wouldn't eat nothing.
I was so skinny,

786
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.220
I could barely lift my head up off the bed.

787
00:44:19.221 --> 00:44:22.550
And the hospital band that they gave me would go all the way up to my,

788
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.170
my bicep pretty much because I just wouldn't want to eat.
I want it to die.

789
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:28.310
Like the nurses hated me.

790
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.700
Like one of one of the nurses coming in at like two in the morning.

791
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:36.710
I finally got some sleep and she kept poking me around with the needle and I

792
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.020
literally called her a stupid idiot and like,

793
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.270
and she wasn't my nurse no more.
And,
and I,
I felt so bad,

794
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.490
but you know,
it just,

795
00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.260
I felt like my whole life was taken from me just from stepping in that bomb.

796
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:52.561
You know,

797
00:44:52.561 --> 00:44:57.561
I knew what could happen to me and my whole point of being deployed was I'm

798
00:44:57.751 --> 00:45:00.030
either going to come home with my Bros,
I'm come home in a body bag.

799
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.870
There's no in the middle.
And,
uh,

800
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:08.520
and here I am now down this whole dark path,
this new road,

801
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:12.060
you know,
as a 20 year old,
how in the world am I going to live my life now?

802
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:16.050
Like I got,
I don't even know what a Blonde Guy Gal,
no legs can do.

803
00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.620
<v 0>Oh,
at what point did you realize that you weren't gonna be able to see anymore?</v>

804
00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.960
<v 2>It was pretty much march,
Sec,</v>

805
00:45:23.961 --> 00:45:28.460
and I believe it was my last surgery that they tried to Kinda like give me some

806
00:45:28.461 --> 00:45:32.600
vision back and nothing come back from that.
And you know,
about the time,

807
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:33.470
March 2nd got there,

808
00:45:33.471 --> 00:45:36.530
I was still positive and upbeat and I was moving around a lot more,

809
00:45:36.531 --> 00:45:39.940
starting to gain weight and um,
but you know,

810
00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.790
they,
they told me that they can do the surgery,

811
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.270
but then they also told me that it's,
it's not,
uh,
you know,

812
00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.630
a high percentage that you're going to get vision back at all.
You know,

813
00:45:50.631 --> 00:45:55.040
when they started coming to like talking about,
um,
you know,

814
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.600
live in life,
visually impaired and,
but it was,
uh,

815
00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.960
it was tough.
It was,
it wasn't,
you know,
and to me the,

816
00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:08.420
the vision didn't bother me much at all.
They was losing my legs.
And you know,

817
00:46:08.421 --> 00:46:10.640
the Marine Corps,
uh,
you know,

818
00:46:10.641 --> 00:46:14.840
it's the joining the Marine Corps in 2004 was the greatest decision of my life

819
00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.740
for the reasons like this right now because it was the marine corps that was

820
00:46:18.741 --> 00:46:22.670
there each and every day in my hospital room talking to me and,
um,

821
00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.590
helping me understand that this road that I'm getting ready to go down,
you know,

822
00:46:27.591 --> 00:46:29.510
that there is the light at the end of the tunnel.

823
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:33.650
And not only talking about my deployment or talking about the marine corps,

824
00:46:33.651 --> 00:46:38.390
but just talking about life and coming in there joking around with me and

825
00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.510
because,
uh,
you know,
looking back on it now,

826
00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:47.030
I'm truly fortunate and blessed to be here today because the amount of blood I

827
00:46:47.031 --> 00:46:51.470
lost was a body's worth of blood.
My left leg was taken from me.

828
00:46:51.471 --> 00:46:54.550
I have peace of my small intestines taken out,
you know,

829
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.540
shrapnel went through both my eyes and,
and you know,
it's just,

830
00:46:59.541 --> 00:47:00.710
it's truly a blessing

831
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.400
<v 0>now that's obviously a big transition of calling it a blessing and calling your,</v>

832
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.780
where you're at right now.

833
00:47:09.781 --> 00:47:14.781
A blessing from when you first realized your situation and you're saying,

834
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:19.110
hey,
you,
you wanted to die.
I mean,
that's,
I mean,

835
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:20.940
that's just as bad as it gets.

836
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.430
What do you think it was that made you start to realize,
you know what,

837
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:31.630
all right,
here's my new situation and I'm going to,
I'm going to get after it.

838
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:33.900
<v 2>The marines that would come in to visit me,</v>

839
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:38.310
they kept reiterating that I was a marine.
The nurses,

840
00:47:38.311 --> 00:47:40.410
the corpsman,
even though I would fight it,

841
00:47:40.411 --> 00:47:43.080
they never gave up on me and they still pushed and challenged me.

842
00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.740
And I think that was the one thing that made me realize that this is just a new

843
00:47:49.441 --> 00:47:51.030
challenge for me.
You know?

844
00:47:51.031 --> 00:47:54.000
And the one thing in the marine corps is to adapt and overcome.

845
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:58.140
I'm gonna have to learn to adapt to these injuries and overcome it.
And,
um,

846
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.420
that's one thing that helped me realize that there's life outside of the

847
00:48:00.421 --> 00:48:01.081
hospital doors.

848
00:48:01.081 --> 00:48:03.510
Because at that time when I was going through the depression and guilt,

849
00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.070
there was two roads I could have went down.
You know,
the self pity,
the drugs,

850
00:48:08.071 --> 00:48:11.130
alcoholism,
suicide.
But I don't want to go down that road.

851
00:48:11.131 --> 00:48:12.570
I didn't want to be another statistic.

852
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.050
I want to go down the road of happiness and live in my life to the fullest and

853
00:48:16.051 --> 00:48:18.600
proving people wrong.
People tell me I can't do something,

854
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.370
that I'm going to go out and do it.

855
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:25.390
I want to be that blind guy with no legs proving people wrong.
You know?
And,

856
00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.810
and that's what I always told people when I first got her.
I was like,

857
00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:31.140
anything you can do,
I can do,
I might do it differently,

858
00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:35.190
but it's going to get done.
And during that time,
with that marine coming in,

859
00:48:35.191 --> 00:48:36.120
that hospital room,

860
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:39.780
this was when I realized in my mind that this is what I wanna do.

861
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:42.450
I wanna I want to put myself in his position.

862
00:48:42.451 --> 00:48:46.140
I want to help out other severely wounded warriors,
marines,
soldiers,
sailors,

863
00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:50.400
airmen.
And I begin creating these goals.
And these,
you know,

864
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.510
so a lot of them broad,

865
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.810
the one broad wind was staying in the Marine Corps and you know,

866
00:48:54.811 --> 00:48:57.690
but I realized that I need these little goals.

867
00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.970
First I need to learn to get out of my hospital bed.

868
00:48:59.971 --> 00:49:03.360
I need to go from hospital bed to my wheelchair and I need to learn to eat.

869
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:08.250
And the,
once I started realizing this and I started putting my mind in the right

870
00:49:08.251 --> 00:49:11.370
direction,
then I started getting off medications.

871
00:49:11.371 --> 00:49:16.371
I started getting off pain pills and I started getting more weight on my body.

872
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.160
And I was injured on January 18th.

873
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:24.670
I was in Bethesda on January 21st and by March 20,
first I was headed to my,

874
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.460
the polytrauma center in Richmond,
Virginia,

875
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:30.300
where I would focus more on physical therapy and occupational therapy.

876
00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:34.200
So it's like,
you know,
I,
I was young and I healed quicker,

877
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.340
but once I got it in my mind that I could do this,
then I didn't need,

878
00:49:38.341 --> 00:49:41.940
I didn't want anybody slowing me down.
And,
and that's,
uh,
you know,

879
00:49:41.941 --> 00:49:46.941
I went through the polytrauma center and I was there for two months and by June

880
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:52.210
29th of 2007,
I was signed up on my prostate legs for the first time.
And,
uh,

881
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.110
you

882
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.660
<v 0>know,
one of the things that I talk about,</v>

883
00:49:54.661 --> 00:49:59.150
what I talked to vets is I always tell them,
you know,

884
00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:03.090
people say w,
W,
W,
w how do we get through this?
And I always say,

885
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.470
you got to find a new mission.
And because you know,
you've had this mission,

886
00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:10.620
whatever that mission was,
whether whatever service branch you were in,

887
00:50:10.621 --> 00:50:11.580
wherever you are fighting,

888
00:50:11.581 --> 00:50:16.140
you had a mission and it makes your life very clear and simple because what you

889
00:50:16.141 --> 00:50:20.610
do every day is you tried to accomplish the mission.
And when I,

890
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.440
when I hear you talking about that,
it's like,
it's exactly that.

891
00:50:25.441 --> 00:50:28.460
You were in a situation,
you had a mission,
boom,

892
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.270
you get blown up now you don't have a mission anymore.
And now when you get,

893
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.920
you wake up in Bethesda,
you're,
you're in this situation.
You Go,
oh,
I don't,

894
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.160
I don't,
I'm depressed.
I don't want to live anymore.

895
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.620
And then someone comes in and says,
hey,
you can help.

896
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.680
And then all of a sudden,
boom,
you have a new mission.

897
00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:53.630
And as soon as you get that new mission,
you go,
yes,
I can.
Oh,
and by the way,
you,

898
00:50:53.631 --> 00:50:55.040
you don't think I'm going to be able to walk.

899
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:57.800
You don't think I want to be able to fend for myself.
Watch this.

900
00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:02.770
<v 2>And you know,
like looking back and out January 18th,
2007,</v>

901
00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:07.060
I felt like that was the day that the Lord above looked down on me.

902
00:51:07.061 --> 00:51:11.020
He didn't want me to,
he didn't want me to go to heaven yet.
And he gave me,

903
00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.050
he put me on a new patrol in life as you mentioned,
mission.

904
00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:19.150
And that was to share my story and inspire it others by living my life to the

905
00:51:19.151 --> 00:51:23.830
fullest and beyond my own bare minimal.
And I felt like that,

906
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:28.420
um,
I feel like that was my new mission in life.
That you know,

907
00:51:28.421 --> 00:51:31.720
we're all brought on this earth to serve in some kind of purpose,

908
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.860
served some mission and you know,
sharing my story and going out,

909
00:51:35.861 --> 00:51:39.430
doing things that I'm doing today is inspiring and motivating others,

910
00:51:39.431 --> 00:51:44.370
not those who were injured in combat,
but people who are living,
you know,

911
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.910
a civilian life today.

912
00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:51.420
And it truly inspires and motivates me to continue doing what I'm doing.

913
00:51:51.581 --> 00:51:54.220
Because I know that I'm inspiring somebody along the way.

914
00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.060
And I always tell people,
if I could do inspire,
motivate one person a day,

915
00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:01.840
then that's a job well done for me.
And that's what I'm left on this earth to do.

916
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:05.670
And um,
I love it.
You know,
it's just a,

917
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.290
this is what I've been given and I might as well accept it and move on.
You know,

918
00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:15.070
improvise something that we're always learned in the Marine Corps.
And you know,

919
00:52:15.071 --> 00:52:17.020
when I,
when I do speaking engagements,

920
00:52:17.021 --> 00:52:19.660
I focused on a lot of things in the Marine Corps that I learned,

921
00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:24.520
like adapt and overcome.
And you know,
the next one is lead by example,

922
00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:28.150
which you know a lot about I'm sure.
And then the next one is never quit.

923
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:32.290
And through it all through those three,
attitude is everything.

924
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.560
If you walk into any situation with a positive attitude,

925
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.640
that's the first step to success.
If you think about something negatively,

926
00:52:39.641 --> 00:52:41.260
then you're never going to accomplish anything.

927
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:44.530
So when I was laying in that hospital bed,

928
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.910
there was no negative thoughts,
you know,
and I had guys,

929
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.000
one of the Marines who were actually was wounded two months before me,

930
00:52:52.001 --> 00:52:57.001
lost a leg in Adita would come in day in and night and he would also kind of

931
00:52:57.221 --> 00:52:59.440
tell me,
it's like,
all right,
this is what's going to go on.
You know,

932
00:52:59.441 --> 00:53:02.240
you're going to get a prosthetic.
It's going to be a long,
you know,

933
00:53:02.241 --> 00:53:05.230
it's the rehabs intense,
but this is it,
you know,

934
00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:09.190
but put one foot in front of the next.
And that's what I kept living life with.

935
00:53:09.191 --> 00:53:13.490
And when I was trying to learn how to walk in 2007,
I was a,

936
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.090
as a double amputee,

937
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:18.130
tend to scissor walk one foot in front of the next and you pretty much trip over

938
00:53:18.131 --> 00:53:21.820
yourself and you look like an idiot.
But,
um,
but with vision,

939
00:53:21.821 --> 00:53:25.470
I was going from the right wall to the left wall and my physical therapist

940
00:53:25.471 --> 00:53:27.900
stopped.
Things like Matt,
just stop,
just,
just walk,

941
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.340
put one foot in front of the next.
And I looked back on that now.

942
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:34.620
And that's how we live each and every day.

943
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.700
It's like we never know what tomorrow's going to hold or next week we've got to

944
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:42.360
worry about right now in the present.
And that's how I live my life right now.

945
00:53:42.361 --> 00:53:44.670
And I never know what that next step's going to be,

946
00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:47.920
but I'm going to take that step forward,
you know?
And you know,

947
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:51.750
I might walk around with two prosthetic legs and look darkness in the,
you know,

948
00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.650
the face every day.
But tell you one thing,
my uh,

949
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:59.340
my toes are pointing forward and my vision on life is 2020.

950
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:04.260
And that's what I tell people today.
And it's a,
I love it.
I love it.
And it's,

951
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.580
you know,
it's the adrenaline,

952
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:10.320
the motivation to do things when you can't see and it hurts

953
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:11.800
<v 3>when you run into thanks to so,</v>

954
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.130
so the attitude of just walk,
that's,
that's a,

955
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:20.560
that's a beautiful attitude to have.
Just walk,
quit,

956
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:23.890
quit all this other stuff,
just get up walk.

957
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:28.600
How hard was the transition from the bed to the wheelchair,

958
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.370
to the,
to the prosthetics to walk into moving on the prosthetics?

959
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.680
<v 2>It really,
I think getting used to the prosthetics was,
you know,</v>

960
00:54:38.681 --> 00:54:41.830
basically getting my legs used to wearing prosthetics and that,

961
00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:47.140
that was the hardest thing because like I would go to therapy every day and I

962
00:54:47.141 --> 00:54:48.850
would put them on and I'd walk around in therapy,

963
00:54:48.851 --> 00:54:52.210
but then I'd go right back to the wheelchair and,
and really never,

964
00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:54.310
never wore them more than,
you know,

965
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.600
a couple hours a day just because I'd swarming therapy until I went to the blind

966
00:54:58.601 --> 00:54:59.590
school in Chicago.

967
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:04.060
And this gave me the opportunity where I had no chance to go back to my room and

968
00:55:04.061 --> 00:55:08.110
take them off.
So I had to wear them from seven in the morning to five at night.

969
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:12.970
And that's helped me strengthen up my legs and the callouses on my legs get used

970
00:55:12.971 --> 00:55:16.780
to wearing prosthetics.
And once I got back from the blind school,

971
00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:17.920
six months of there,

972
00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:22.690
I was pretty much on my legs from sunrise to sunset and,

973
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.320
and uh,
that was,
uh,
but you know,
through,
you know,

974
00:55:26.321 --> 00:55:28.510
setting these goals early on in my rehab,

975
00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:32.440
like re enlist in the Marine Corps was the one thing that I wanted to do.

976
00:55:32.441 --> 00:55:36.720
And so learning how to walk,
I focused on that more than my,

977
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:41.050
my blindness because I,
I knew learning,
uh,

978
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.890
learning life,
you know,
in the dark would be a lot easier with legs.

979
00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:49.150
And that helped out so much because I tried to maneuver around in a wheelchair,

980
00:55:49.151 --> 00:55:51.250
being blind and a long cane and all this stuff.

981
00:55:51.251 --> 00:55:52.900
And I just kept running into more things.

982
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:56.920
But once I got on my legs and I started using a long cane and started walking

983
00:55:56.921 --> 00:56:01.450
around and,
you know,
it really helped out a lot.
So like

984
00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:06.580
<v 3>that's like the ultimate form of prioritize and execute.
Yeah.
You know what?
Okay,</v>

985
00:56:06.581 --> 00:56:07.414
I can't see,

986
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:11.650
but I can't walk the number one thing I'm gonna do exactly what she did.

987
00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.710
And you know,
it's the,

988
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:18.160
<v 2>from the hospital bed to the wheelchair to the prosthetics and then go to the</v>

989
00:56:18.161 --> 00:56:20.890
blind school,
knock that out.
And once I'm at the blind school,

990
00:56:20.891 --> 00:56:23.230
I'm learning everything from computer to independent.

991
00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:25.890
<v 0>And that's a six month school going to the blind school.</v>

992
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:26.460
<v 2>The,
the,</v>

993
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:31.210
the first program is six months and that's basically learning to live BM,

994
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:32.044
visually impaired.

995
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:36.700
And you go back for computers and they got so many different programs now.

996
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:41.850
But I went there for basically from July to December just because I incorporated

997
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.880
computers and with my program as well.

998
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:50.140
And a saas spent from July to December in Chicago.

999
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:54.880
So I experienced the cold weather there,
but you don't learn everything from,

1000
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:59.800
you know,
checking emails to Braille to taking,
um,

1001
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.720
taking the subway and train all the way downtown Chicago and circling the block

1002
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:09.250
and even build a bird house.
When I was in Chicago,
and I don't know about you,

1003
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:11.000
but a table saw scared me when I had

1004
00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:15.560
<v 0>vision trying to,
trying to cut,
cut a piece of board when</v>

1005
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:20.280
<v 2>vision.
That's a little intimidating there.
But,
uh,
I didn't lose a finger,</v>

1006
00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:21.143
thankfully.

1007
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.963
<v 0>Yeah,
you know that,</v>

1008
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:28.100
that's another thing that I'm hearing about what you're saying is like the way

1009
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.230
in,
and this is something you hear all the time,

1010
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.890
but the way that you're describing it is people say,
Oh,
you know,

1011
00:57:34.891 --> 00:57:36.260
you're going to get your big goal.
You know,

1012
00:57:36.261 --> 00:57:38.190
you've got your big goal in the future,

1013
00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:42.300
but what you have to do is you have to set up these little goals along the way

1014
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:44.280
to get you there that are pointing in the right direction.

1015
00:57:44.281 --> 00:57:48.150
So your big goal is you wanted to stay in the marine corps,
be able to reenlist.

1016
00:57:48.151 --> 00:57:49.290
In order to be able to do that,

1017
00:57:49.291 --> 00:57:52.290
you had to be able to walk you gotta to be able to function.

1018
00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.550
And so you just had to fight through these little things every single day to

1019
00:57:56.551 --> 00:58:00.140
make progress.
And it's funny because you know the,

1020
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.130
the way I've honestly described this before,
it was like,

1021
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.100
it's like shooting when you're looking,
you know,

1022
00:58:05.101 --> 00:58:08.070
you've got your target that's far off in the distance 400 meters away.

1023
00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.480
If you stare at that thing,

1024
00:58:09.481 --> 00:58:11.850
your vision is going to get blurry and you'll lose track of it.

1025
00:58:11.851 --> 00:58:14.710
So you have to focus on the front sight.
This front side focus,

1026
00:58:14.711 --> 00:58:18.540
that's what you do.
And that the thing in the background,

1027
00:58:18.541 --> 00:58:20.730
you know it kind of fades a little bit,
but you know it's there.

1028
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.340
And then what happens is occasionally,

1029
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:26.010
and so it's the same thing with your goals,
right?
You have your longterm goal,

1030
00:58:26.011 --> 00:58:29.250
but that thing is so far away.
Sometimes it gets blurry and if you,

1031
00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:32.730
and so what you do is you focus on some little thing that's right in front of

1032
00:58:32.731 --> 00:58:36.420
you that you can do and then that brings you a little bit closer to the goal.

1033
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:39.810
But occasionally those little things that are short term,

1034
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.760
you're doing them day after day after day after day they,

1035
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:45.000
they start to grind on you and you say,
you know what?
Forget it.

1036
00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:46.350
I don't even want to do this today.

1037
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:49.890
And that's when you have to look up once again at your longterm goal and say,

1038
00:58:49.891 --> 00:58:52.590
wait a second,
I'm moving in that direction.
I'm trying to get there.

1039
00:58:52.591 --> 00:58:56.010
But to hear you describe these little things,
and by the way,

1040
00:58:56.011 --> 00:58:58.260
you're throwing them out there like it's no big deal.
Like,
oh,

1041
00:58:58.261 --> 00:59:01.560
I just was all right.
It went from the bed to the wheelchair to the,
to the,

1042
00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.990
to the prosthetics.
Then I went to the blind school and the next thing you know,

1043
00:59:03.991 --> 00:59:07.140
I'm making bird cages on bird feeders.

1044
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:10.280
And like I'm,
I mean the,
the,

1045
00:59:10.281 --> 00:59:14.910
the small effort or the small tasks that took immense effort along the way.

1046
00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:17.130
But you know,
from my perspective,

1047
00:59:17.131 --> 00:59:20.430
what I see is you made it each and every one of those things.
A mission,

1048
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.010
I'm going to do this,
I'm going to

1049
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.750
<v 3>do that.
Okay,
I can do that now.
Cool.
I'm gonna do this.</v>

1050
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:26.000
And these are small little progressive steps,

1051
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.470
but you're making them and you're making them every day.

1052
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:32.060
Every day you get up and you'd just walk,
walk forward.

1053
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:35.890
<v 2>And that's the one thing with being in the marine corps and has really helped me</v>

1054
00:59:35.891 --> 00:59:37.810
out along this way is,
you know,

1055
00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:41.140
being organized and getting in that routine where,
you know,

1056
00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:44.050
you wake up each and every day,
it's like,
okay,
I'm gonna knock this out.

1057
00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:47.110
This is my goal for the day.
And you know,

1058
00:59:47.111 --> 00:59:52.111
bettering myself was one of the goals cause I knew that I couldn't get nothing

1059
00:59:53.171 --> 00:59:57.040
done in this life if I didn't better myself first.
And you know,

1060
00:59:57.041 --> 00:59:58.900
through the early days of my recovery,

1061
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.380
getting off pain pills was one of the first things that I wanted to do as well.

1062
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:07.390
And it's been 12 years since I last saw of pain pill and that's,
you know,

1063
01:00:07.391 --> 01:00:10.270
and it's,
uh,
I didn't,
I didn't want my life to,
you know,

1064
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:13.840
revert back to pain pills and just,
you know,
I feel a little bit of pain then,

1065
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.200
then I'm going to like go get,
take a pill.
And you know,

1066
01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:21.370
I replaced that with staying busy,
st active,

1067
01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.010
going to the gym,
working out and,
and it,

1068
01:00:25.011 --> 01:00:29.390
it really helped out a lot.
I didn't just,
you know,

1069
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:32.350
if I felt like I got pain and I'm going to go give it some pain,
you know,

1070
01:00:32.351 --> 01:00:37.240
and that's,
and that's,
uh,
and it's the one thing and it's just,

1071
01:00:37.241 --> 01:00:40.810
uh,
you know,
through it,
through it all I've learned along the way is like,

1072
01:00:40.811 --> 01:00:43.240
people told me I couldn't do something or I can't do it.

1073
01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.920
Why do you want to stay in the Marine Corps?

1074
01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:47.800
You make so much more money outside of the Marine Corps.
I'm like,
well,

1075
01:00:47.801 --> 01:00:50.550
I didn't join the Marine Corps for money,
you know?
And that's that,

1076
01:00:50.551 --> 01:00:55.210
that I've used that as motivation and it got me along this way and,
and um,

1077
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:58.030
you know,
I just,
I pretty much just like whatever,
you know,

1078
01:00:58.031 --> 01:00:59.590
you think that for yourself,

1079
01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:04.650
but I know what my mission in life is and I kept a positive attitude and people

1080
01:01:04.781 --> 01:01:09.370
saw that.
And you know,
once I got back from the blind school in 2009,

1081
01:01:09.371 --> 01:01:10.930
I started getting out doing these events.

1082
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.320
And the first event I actually did was something I opened my mouth to my

1083
01:01:14.321 --> 01:01:17.500
physical therapist and forgot all about until like two months before was the

1084
01:01:17.501 --> 01:01:21.820
Bataan death march in 2009 and he walked up to me and he was like,

1085
01:01:21.821 --> 01:01:24.100
Oh Matt,
you're going to do the Bataan death March this year,
right?

1086
01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:27.010
You said last year?
And I'm like,
Oh crap.
And you know,

1087
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:31.960
I walked out and I did 10 miles in eight hours and that was the first,

1088
01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.140
like I was proud of doing 10 miles in eight hours.
But that was the first event,

1089
01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.440
first hike that I ever fell out of that I quit on.

1090
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.660
<v 3>So for people who don't know the Bataan death march is an event that they do out</v>

1091
01:01:41.661 --> 01:01:46.520
here and it's,
it's 26 miles,
right?
It is.
And they've got to bring up,

1092
01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.360
you got to wear a rock.
Some people,
yeah,

1093
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.280
I just wear camelback,
but they do it.
Well,

1094
01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:57.770
explain.
Explain what,
what the Bataan death march is.

1095
01:01:57.771 --> 01:02:02.040
Obviously it's to commemorate or to,
to remember the,

1096
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.700
the folks that were actually on the real Bataan death march.

1097
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.630
But what is the one that they do here this year actually

1098
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.360
<v 2>it was the 30th annual Bataan memorial death march in White Sands,</v>

1099
01:02:13.361 --> 01:02:16.630
New Mexico.
When I did it in 2009,
they,
uh,

1100
01:02:16.631 --> 01:02:18.970
it's a 26.2 long or a mile long.

1101
01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:24.030
And then they also have a 14 mile honorary.
And um,
the,

1102
01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:27.610
the 26.2 miles is actually up a mountain and down a mountain.
And it's,

1103
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.410
it's intense cause you're walking through the sands and a part of it is this

1104
01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:35.500
loose sand pit and it's,
uh,
you know,
it's,

1105
01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:38.890
it's a good test,
especially for people with prosthetics and you know,

1106
01:02:38.891 --> 01:02:41.670
when you're kind of endurance and see how far you can go.

1107
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.640
And when I signed up in 2009,

1108
01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:47.430
I've walked 10 miles out in eight hours and I was like,
all right,

1109
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:52.180
that's pretty proud.
You know,
I got hurt two years ago.
But then I like,

1110
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:52.771
again,

1111
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:57.090
like I quit and then at have really bugged me and I use that as motivation and

1112
01:02:57.091 --> 01:03:00.960
it humbled me knowing that,
you know,
I was a good runner before.

1113
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:05.510
I never quit on any hikes.
Like,
I would always finish.
And then a,

1114
01:03:05.511 --> 01:03:08.790
it realized that,
okay,
I'm not who I am before,

1115
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:13.080
so I got to learn the learn this way now,
you know,

1116
01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:17.460
and not everything's as easy as it used to be.
But once,

1117
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:21.150
once I finished,
like I told the Lady,
I told my therapist and I was like,

1118
01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:21.751
once I'm done,

1119
01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:26.250
I'm putting my medical board and I'm going for my reenlistment package.
And,

1120
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.140
and I was like,
all right,
10 miles in.

1121
01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:32.930
And that was in March of 2009 and basically August of 2009,
I got my,

1122
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.550
you know,
my ratings back of course 100%.

1123
01:03:35.551 --> 01:03:39.780
And I chose to go through the ELD program extended but permanent limited duty.

1124
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.770
And um,
that took all the way Til April,

1125
01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:48.120
2000 where the end of March of 2010.
And actually today,

1126
01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:50.840
April 1st wood bin was the day that,
uh,

1127
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:54.900
I was promoted to corporal and with the battalion commander that called me when

1128
01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:57.960
I was in San Antonio was like,
Hey,
congratulations,

1129
01:03:57.961 --> 01:03:59.700
you're getting promoted to corporal.
And I was like,
sir,

1130
01:03:59.701 --> 01:04:04.320
is this an April fool's joke?
You know,
it's like,
and it's uh,
and but,
but uh,

1131
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:06.630
on April 7th,
2010,
I re enlisted,

1132
01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.650
I raise my right hand and got a chance to stay in the Marine Corps for a few

1133
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:14.250
more years.
And that was the greatest thing ever right there.

1134
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:17.430
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
that's,
that's the reason why I started off today reading that oath,</v>

1135
01:04:17.431 --> 01:04:20.850
because for you to be doing that and the condition you were in,

1136
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:23.130
having already sacrificed and saying,
you know what,

1137
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.170
I got more to give and I'm going to give it.

1138
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.350
<v 2>And that's the one thing.
Like when I was mentioned lead by example,</v>

1139
01:04:28.351 --> 01:04:32.760
one of my therapists told me as I go to therapy every day and I put my legs on,

1140
01:04:32.761 --> 01:04:36.780
I stand up,
I'll walk out,
you know,
just I do my own thing.
And he's like,
man,

1141
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:40.620
you don't ever,
you won't see this.
Of course.
And you will never realize this,

1142
01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:42.210
but every day when you walk in here,

1143
01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.730
you sit down and you put your prospects on and get up and walk out.

1144
01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.220
People stare at you and people look at you.

1145
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:50.130
And that's the right thing to lead by example.
You know,

1146
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:53.250
it's like if you wake up each and every day and you do it the right way,

1147
01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.730
then people will follow,
you know,
and,
and uh,

1148
01:04:56.731 --> 01:04:59.670
I've learned now it's like from living my life,

1149
01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:02.430
it's just to wake up and continue doing the right thing,

1150
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.940
then people will follow and you know,
it's,
it's,

1151
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:10.410
it's something that I focus a lot on.
It's not being an a tense yelling leader,

1152
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.030
but it's just doing it the right way.

1153
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:15.960
And that's something that I've done along the way.
And of course in therapy,

1154
01:05:15.961 --> 01:05:17.620
if you're in the marine in,
you're an army,

1155
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:20.500
go on the ground and you don't want that marine up there walking is like,

1156
01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:21.600
I need to beat this guy.

1157
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:26.800
And then you also ended up going to college,
right?
I did.

1158
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:29.500
I did hear.
What Year did you start college?

1159
01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:34.780
I started in 2011 at Coastal Carolina Community College in Jacksonville,

1160
01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:38.620
North Carolina.
What was once a re enlist it?
They asked me where I wanted to go.

1161
01:05:38.621 --> 01:05:39.820
I don't want to go to the wounded warrior battalion,

1162
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:43.630
East Campbell Gym because I realized my,
I could help out more there.

1163
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:48.470
And I got there and in 2011,
I went on a closure trip back to our rack.

1164
01:05:48.471 --> 01:05:51.790
And that's when I realized that I joined the Marine Corps to deploy.

1165
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:52.780
And I can't deploy now,

1166
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:56.080
but I could still share my story and I don't have to share my story with wearing

1167
01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:59.500
the uniform.
Is it the Marine Corps that takes you on the closure trip?

1168
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:04.640
It was a nonprofit first foundation and um,
it's,
uh,
actually the,
the,

1169
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:10.150
the episode that I went on 60 minutes air it in 2011.
So it's on Youtube,

1170
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:14.750
but a nice plug.
But it's,
uh,
but,
uh,

1171
01:06:14.751 --> 01:06:17.590
I learned a lot about my time in the Marine Corps and,

1172
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:20.110
and the one thing with being a marine is you're always a marine.

1173
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:24.970
And that's a title I get to take to my grave.
And when I'm 85 years old,

1174
01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.950
I can look at my great grandkids and be like,

1175
01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:30.450
I served the United States Marine Corps.
And,
um,
so it's,

1176
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.430
and during that time we were starting a family and I was getting ready to take

1177
01:06:33.431 --> 01:06:34.420
college classes.

1178
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:39.490
So the one thing that I'm very fortunate about is everything through life.

1179
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:44.470
Like it's each step,
each chapter.
It comes right after the next one.

1180
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.430
Like I never have time to sit down and think about what's next.
And you know,

1181
01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:53.020
I got out in 2012 and we moved right back to Kentucky and I started taking

1182
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:57.550
college classes and you know,
my brilliant,
an amazing wife,

1183
01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:00.280
you know,
while we're trying to figure out where we want to live.
She's like,

1184
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:02.440
you've your dream school was university,
Kentucky,

1185
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:06.010
so let's move back to there and you can go to school there in graduate there.

1186
01:07:06.011 --> 01:07:08.800
And I started taking classes there in 2014.

1187
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:13.801
And May of 2017 I walked across the stage at Rupp arena and got my diploma in

1188
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:18.700
Media Arts and history and,
and it's,
uh,
you know,
not only a marine for life,

1189
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:23.260
but a wildcat for lie.
I felt,
I felt,
I feel,

1190
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:26.260
I feel a little strange being that,
you know,
the 30 year old like kid and,

1191
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:26.740
you know,

1192
01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.980
partying like a 10 year old there and when the basketball team won or something

1193
01:07:29.981 --> 01:07:34.070
like that,
you know,
I'm the,
I'm just that old creepy dude over there now.
And not,

1194
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:38.020
not the youngster anymore,
but,
but it,
it was,
um,

1195
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.950
it was fun to go back and take college classes and everything that I learned

1196
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.660
that I should've learned in high school.
Like I'm like loving college now.

1197
01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:48.490
When I spoke at a,
um,

1198
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.720
a child development center a couple of months ago and the kids asked me,

1199
01:07:52.721 --> 01:07:55.690
it was like,
what?
What do you think of school?
I'm like,
you know,
it's,

1200
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.080
I wasn't the greatest of students in high school,
but tell you what,

1201
01:07:59.081 --> 01:08:03.180
I loved college.
I loved going back and reading books.
I love to read now.
And,

1202
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:08.140
and it,
it just expands my mind and my knowledge on things.

1203
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:12.120
And it's uh,
you know,
it's good going down and sitting down with people and,

1204
01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.790
and you could share stories on different things and not just something about the

1205
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:21.110
military,
but you could talk about this and this and you know,
it's uh,

1206
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.633
it was fun.

1207
01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.620
<v 0>It's your are,</v>

1208
01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:28.050
I want to just kind of jump back to your workouts a little bit and I know you

1209
01:08:28.051 --> 01:08:31.230
post some of your workouts in,
uh,
on,
on Twitter and stuff.

1210
01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:34.080
Some little shots sometimes.
I know you posted one the other day.

1211
01:08:34.081 --> 01:08:36.420
If you put pushing a sled said were pushing down,

1212
01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:40.320
which means that all the way out to California legit,
uh,

1213
01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:43.430
do when you wake up every day,
is that the first thing you do is,

1214
01:08:43.431 --> 01:08:44.730
is try and get your workout in.

1215
01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.000
<v 2>I tried to,
I prefer working out in the morning,</v>

1216
01:08:48.001 --> 01:08:51.840
but now with traveling and you know,
catching up hours at work,

1217
01:08:51.841 --> 01:08:55.710
I had to do an evening workouts,
which I,
I can't,
I hate doing even work.

1218
01:08:55.711 --> 01:08:59.610
So I'm ready to go home,
take my legs off.
But,
but those are the,
those are the,

1219
01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:03.930
I work out in the evening.
I tried to get them in as much as I possibly can.

1220
01:09:03.931 --> 01:09:06.390
I love to work out.
And if not,
then I'll just do it at home.

1221
01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:11.160
I got some dumb bells and curls curls there.
And,
um,
but you know,

1222
01:09:11.161 --> 01:09:14.100
throughout,
throughout the day I'm like constantly on my legs walking around,

1223
01:09:14.101 --> 01:09:18.450
you know,
doing some cardio.
But,
you know,
I love,
I love taking shots at you.

1224
01:09:18.451 --> 01:09:21.590
They're Jocko on Twitter,
you know,
and that's,
uh,
um,

1225
01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.330
I think one of the tweets I actually mentioned to you,
I was like,

1226
01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:28.770
you do the squat and I'll do the pushing the sled and,
but uh,
you know,

1227
01:09:28.771 --> 01:09:31.680
it's like even through,
even through training my trainer,

1228
01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:34.120
it's funny because I joke with him all the time on like,

1229
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.020
his name's Josh and I'm like,
look,

1230
01:09:37.021 --> 01:09:39.330
you're just here to walk me from machine to Shane.
All right.

1231
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:42.760
I'll tell you what I want to work out today.
And,
and um,

1232
01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.990
like it get to the point where I'm getting bored doing pull ups,

1233
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:47.430
put some chains on me.

1234
01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.890
Now I'll do some pilots with some chains on me and something like that already,

1235
01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.640
some pushups or I'll get to the bench press and do some chains on the bench

1236
01:09:53.641 --> 01:09:54.031
press.

1237
01:09:54.031 --> 01:09:57.600
And it's like just something else that challenge it and set a sticking to the

1238
01:09:57.601 --> 01:10:01.910
same old thing everyday thing.
And it's a,
and you know,

1239
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:06.480
personal bests on the bench press couple of weeks ago at two 60.

1240
01:10:06.481 --> 01:10:10.690
I'm proud of that.
And then of course,
pushing the sled and,
um,

1241
01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:14.690
but now it's like,
you know,
I've,
I've learned doing the,

1242
01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.700
I do spartan races and marathons and I've done a marathon and I did a marathon

1243
01:10:19.741 --> 01:10:20.730
and I forgot what year it was,

1244
01:10:20.731 --> 01:10:23.940
but I didn't work out or get back on the bike for a whole year.

1245
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.060
And after doing the next marathon,
I was so sore for like a week.

1246
01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:30.270
And I'll realize like if I stay active in the gym and work out,

1247
01:10:30.271 --> 01:10:33.400
then I'm not as sore.
And,
um,
so like,
uh,
I that

1248
01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:36.050
<v 0>news flash,
yeah.
Stay in the gym</v>

1249
01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:38.370
<v 2>and it's,
uh,
so it's like a,</v>

1250
01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:42.040
I'll work out as much as I possibly can because it's like,
I never know what,

1251
01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:44.950
what,
you know,
the organization and I do a lot of these events with like,

1252
01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.780
sometimes they'll just call me.
I'm like,
Hey,

1253
01:10:46.781 --> 01:10:50.080
you wanna do a spartan race in two weeks.
It's like,
oh,
sure.
You know,
and,

1254
01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:55.550
and you know,
through
me,

1255
01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:59.050
sorry,
let me start drinking some water now.
And,
but,
and you know,

1256
01:10:59.051 --> 01:10:59.890
it's like through this,

1257
01:10:59.891 --> 01:11:03.880
it's like each year I tried to find something new to do and for some weird

1258
01:11:03.881 --> 01:11:08.881
reason this year it's like I've got on a stationary bike because my goal is to,

1259
01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:14.820
in July I'm going to bike from Seattle to Portland.
It's like a 203 mile,

1260
01:11:14.821 --> 01:11:15.810
two day event.

1261
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:21.350
And then my ultimate goal in August is the bike across Kentucky on a tandem

1262
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:23.340
bike.
And,
um,

1263
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:27.510
so I got on a stationary bike in January for the first time I got on any kind of

1264
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:31.230
bike in 20 years.
And I'm like,
holy smokes,
this is weird.

1265
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.940
And it's like my lip leg,
like the bud,
the nice side,
like it didn't work,

1266
01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:36.751
so we'll and pedal.

1267
01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:39.060
And so I just took it off and started peddling on my right leg.

1268
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:42.600
And the most I've done was 7.5 miles in 26 minutes.

1269
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:45.270
And I went to my trainer and I looked at my wife and I'm like,

1270
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:48.870
this is the one thing that I feel like I'm doing normal.
You know,

1271
01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:51.870
I feel like I could keep up with somebody with legs.
And,
um,

1272
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:55.080
so I really enjoyed that and I'm looking forward to it.
But,
um,
you know,

1273
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:59.700
like last year I climbed Mount Rainier or half a half of Mount Rainier and,
um,

1274
01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:04.590
this year I'm going to go out and submit it hopefully in July.
So that is,
uh,

1275
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.310
anything I can do to really like challenge myself.
And I always,
uh,

1276
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.530
I always tell him my prosthetist and like any,

1277
01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:13.980
like I got the x three on my left leg,
which is like the best of the best.

1278
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.700
And I'm like,
my goal in life is to break this leg.

1279
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:21.330
It's like if I could break it,
then that's the,
that's a check in the box and

1280
01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:29.790
the Bataan death march,
you were back at that thing,
right.

1281
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:33.990
I attack that two weeks ago and I don't know if you know what it feels like to

1282
01:12:33.991 --> 01:12:38.770
run into a train,
but that's what I felt like Monday afternoon.
But it was a,

1283
01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:43.680
the 2009 really,
like I mentioned,
it humbled me and it motivated me,
you know,

1284
01:12:43.681 --> 01:12:45.750
for the next 10 years.
It's like everything I'm going to do,

1285
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:47.370
I'm to focus on this right here.

1286
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:52.240
Like I went into the baton in 2009 and then my prosthetics wasn't as good and
or,

1287
01:12:52.241 --> 01:12:56.460
or advanced as they are now.
So when I went out there two weeks ago,

1288
01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:01.770
I knocked it out 14 miles at Dr eight miles and we,

1289
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.060
we stepped off at six 56 and by 1120 I hit eight mile marker.

1290
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:11.010
They gave me a 45 minute mile pace and I was knocked out a mile in 25 minutes.

1291
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.670
And it was,
I don't know if it was,
uh,

1292
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.110
my knee was hurting or just the whole fact that I'm getting ready to cross the

1293
01:13:19.111 --> 01:13:21.870
finish line,
but it was like I'd get a little emotional.
I'm like,

1294
01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:23.370
and this is really happening,
you know,

1295
01:13:23.371 --> 01:13:28.371
and to go out and walk this far on two prosthetics and I tell you one thing,

1296
01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:33.630
the models are a lot longer when you can't see,
that's for sure.
And,
but,
um,

1297
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:38.270
it was,
it was fun,
you know,
and uh,
I was,
uh,

1298
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.110
I was out of my legs for about a week,

1299
01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:43.350
actually this last Tuesday is the first time I put my legs on for the first
time.

1300
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:47.460
So it's,
uh,
but you know,
cause you just trashed the skin.

1301
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.280
My left leg had a couple of little red spots on it.
And so my wife,
she,
uh,

1302
01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.590
took a picture and since my process and then she become my nurse and,

1303
01:13:56.070 --> 01:14:00.420
but not to mention the Saturday,
I just walked 3.6,
five miles in a,
like a,

1304
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:04.080
they call it,
it's a run the bluegrass in Lexington and my wife,

1305
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:07.470
she sent me a text and she's like,
Hey,
I think about walking this,

1306
01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:10.230
you could get your wheelchair and I'll push you.
I'm like,
look,

1307
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:11.980
I'm not going to get a metal sit in a wheelchair.

1308
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.560
<v 4>I'm willing to go to walk it or I'm not going to do it.
Okay.</v>

1309
01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:16.900
And so we signed up for the 3.6,

1310
01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:20.650
five miles and we will finish that and an hour and 23 minutes.

1311
01:14:20.651 --> 01:14:24.910
And for some weird reason,
I think walking might be my thing this year too,

1312
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.190
but I had to get you out and do a race with us.
Come and get it.
I've been,

1313
01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:34.510
I've been looking into the,
what's the,
the navy seal obstacle course.

1314
01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:40.330
Oh,
well you mean the one that's in Coronado,
the actual obstacle course.
Oh No,

1315
01:14:40.331 --> 01:14:44.070
no,
not that one.
I'm not that advanced yet.
I'm a marine.
Is it,

1316
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.460
is it the bone of frog or bone frog?
Frog.
Yeah.

1317
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:49.210
So I've been looking into that so,

1318
01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:52.510
well I'm sure those guys will hook you up if you want to go get after it.

1319
01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.110
I'm not big on the water and stuff.
They have like,
you know,

1320
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.720
we'll do everything else.

1321
01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.130
Might not be a great combination if you don't like the water too much.

1322
01:15:00.131 --> 01:15:04.960
Cause I'm sure they put some water to that dude.
Yeah,
no.
Hey,
what was that?

1323
01:15:04.961 --> 01:15:08.000
What was that closure trip?
You know,
speaking about emotional,

1324
01:15:08.001 --> 01:15:12.100
if I'd had to be emotional going,
going to Iraq again,

1325
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:16.090
it was the whole,
um,
when it was mentioned to me in 2011

1326
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:16.840
<v 2>11,</v>

1327
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.860
the only image in my mind that kept popping up is like either a Black Hawk going

1328
01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:25.000
down or see one 30 or something happening because it's like I walked away,

1329
01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:29.650
actually I was medivaced out of that country,
you know,
from,
from my injury.

1330
01:15:29.651 --> 01:15:31.690
So it's like I had no good,

1331
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:36.160
good image of that country at all and it was nerve wracking.

1332
01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:39.700
It was even more nerve wracking being around like the Iraqi security forces,

1333
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.270
you know,
they're clearing rooms and doing mount training.

1334
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:48.280
And here we stand with no weapons or anything.
Like when I was in Iraq,

1335
01:15:48.281 --> 01:15:53.160
no Iraqis had rifles or a ks.
And so that,
that really kind of,
um,

1336
01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.720
it made me worried a lot.

1337
01:15:55.721 --> 01:16:00.490
But I think one of the coolest moments that that really helped me understand it

1338
01:16:00.491 --> 01:16:04.090
was we were meeting the Iraqi security forces and they were all walking up

1339
01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:07.930
shaking our hands and,
and you know,
good uniforms.
And,
um,

1340
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:12.700
they had a patch and one of the guys took his patch off and put it on my flak

1341
01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:16.210
jacket and gave me a big hug.
And I'm like,
you know what,
this is,
this is it.

1342
01:16:16.211 --> 01:16:18.850
And one team,
one fight here,
you know,
and there's,

1343
01:16:18.851 --> 01:16:20.860
there's bad people all over this world,

1344
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:25.660
but there's a lot more good people in this world too.
And,
and I think it really,

1345
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:27.910
um,
it,

1346
01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.120
it made the trip as we were flying back home,

1347
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:35.500
we were going over Iceland and the pilot brought back this little letter and he

1348
01:16:35.501 --> 01:16:36.670
gave it to my buddy and my buddy,

1349
01:16:36.671 --> 01:16:40.870
right at two minutes said US forces have killed Osama bin Ladin and I was like,

1350
01:16:40.871 --> 01:16:43.780
you know what,
that's the perfect closure to a closure trip.

1351
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:49.270
Cause like we all joined the military after 2001 to go after him,

1352
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.380
you know,
to kill him.
And,

1353
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.850
and knowing that this happened on my closure trip,
it's like,
it,
it,

1354
01:16:56.910 --> 01:17:01.300
it honestly like gave me,
it got me emotional,
I was just ready to go home,

1355
01:17:01.301 --> 01:17:04.960
be with my family and that,
that,
that kept it off pretty well.

1356
01:17:04.961 --> 01:17:09.740
And I will say when I was in a hack in 2006,
Saddam Hussein was killed.

1357
01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:13.760
So Saddam was saying in a psalm in loud and you know,
so it's like,
why not?

1358
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.510
But you know what?
Like,
I got so much of that close your trip.

1359
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:20.720
I learned a lot about my life and like what the next step in my life is.

1360
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:23.480
And like I mentioned earlier,

1361
01:17:23.481 --> 01:17:27.770
like when I went back to Afghanistan in 2017 never been in Afghanistan for my

1362
01:17:27.771 --> 01:17:28.071
life,

1363
01:17:28.071 --> 01:17:32.420
but I felt like I got more out of that closure trip because going to Iraq in

1364
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:36.050
2011 I was still in the Marine Corps wearing the uniform every day in

1365
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:36.650
Afghanistan.

1366
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:41.650
I haven't put the uniform on in five years and to put the uniform back on and go

1367
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:46.781
around and speak to soldiers about my marine corps career and be around the

1368
01:17:47.151 --> 01:17:51.140
military again,
truly made me miss it more than anything in the world.

1369
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:52.760
And you know,

1370
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:56.420
the brothers that I met in the Marine Corps and in the military alone,

1371
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:59.480
like they're forever going to be there.
You know,

1372
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:01.340
no matter where you live at in this country,

1373
01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:05.750
they're always going to be there for you.
And knowing that the,

1374
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:10.040
you know,
the,
the name tag across your chest,
United States of America,

1375
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:14.480
that that means more to me,
the neat thing in this world.
And if,

1376
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.390
if I was called back to serve this country again and again,

1377
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:19.790
knowing the risk and what could happen to me,

1378
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:21.920
then I'd go back and do it all over again.

1379
01:18:21.921 --> 01:18:26.600
Because these last 12 years have been truly amazing and I've done things that I

1380
01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:29.870
would never thought out could do.
And I've done it differently.

1381
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.200
And like through the journaling that through the adversity and it's just,

1382
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:39.680
it's inspired and motivated me to come along the way.
And you know,

1383
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:41.900
and it's,
it's,
it's a,
it's a life.

1384
01:18:41.901 --> 01:18:44.720
I love the live and even in the dark,

1385
01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.980
but I know one day will come and then there will be light in my eyes,
you know,

1386
01:18:48.981 --> 01:18:51.140
and I'll be able to open my eyes and see every day.

1387
01:18:51.141 --> 01:18:53.930
But for right now I'm going to live my life to the fullest.

1388
01:18:56.470 --> 01:19:01.210
<v 0>That's incredible.
Do you,
do you ever,
you know,</v>

1389
01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.990
I'll hear from people all the time,
oh,
I don't feel like doing this today.

1390
01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:07.950
I don't feel like doing,
I don't want to work out today.
I don't want wanna.

1391
01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.530
I don't want to get up and do my job today.
You know?
Does that,

1392
01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:14.470
when you hear that kind of thing,
what are your thoughts on that?

1393
01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.650
<v 2>I know for me personally,</v>

1394
01:19:17.651 --> 01:19:20.920
when I've wake up and I don't feel like doing something,
then I tried it.

1395
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:25.300
Or if I feel like I'm in a down mood,
then I try to keep that in in the house.

1396
01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:28.360
Like I don't want to go out into public because I don't want people to see that.

1397
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:32.680
Like when I go out in public,
I want them to see happy Matt,
you know,
positive.

1398
01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:36.010
But hearing people like just,

1399
01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.150
it's hard to hear people complain about things these days,
you know?

1400
01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:43.740
And because you know,
I know what Araca looked like and then you know,

1401
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:45.850
I was in Afghanistan and you know,

1402
01:19:45.851 --> 01:19:48.970
I know what happened to me and I know where I was 12 years ago and what I had to

1403
01:19:48.971 --> 01:19:53.260
do to overcome that.
You know?
And it's just some people just,

1404
01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:54.910
when they feel like they can't do it,

1405
01:19:54.911 --> 01:19:58.180
they just get down in the dumps and they give up.

1406
01:19:58.510 --> 01:20:02.560
And really it's like you got to learn to battle through those adversities.

1407
01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.161
And you know,

1408
01:20:03.161 --> 01:20:05.380
at the end of the day when you put your head down on the pillow and close your

1409
01:20:05.381 --> 01:20:10.230
eyes,
you wake up to a new day,
you know,
and a new day with new challenges.

1410
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:13.200
But you've got to learn to overcome those challenges because in life it's a

1411
01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:14.034
mountain.

1412
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.370
You're going to continue to climb up a mountain and it's never going to flatten

1413
01:20:17.371 --> 01:20:20.100
out.
You're constantly gonna go over any obstacles.

1414
01:20:20.101 --> 01:20:24.270
Boulder's whatever's in your way.
And the only way to go over is the climate.

1415
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.450
It's not to find the easy way around or turn around and quit,
you know?

1416
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:31.710
And you got to learn to just overcome things and,
and honestly,
never give up,

1417
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:34.630
never quit.
Okay.

1418
01:20:37.670 --> 01:20:40.310
<v 0>Clearly you represent that to the fullest.</v>

1419
01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.690
So what are you doing right now in terms,
I know you got a job.
What's that?

1420
01:20:44.691 --> 01:20:45.530
What's that all about?

1421
01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:47.070
<v 2>So,
um,</v>

1422
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:51.480
it's funny how I got this job because my last year at UK I was,

1423
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:55.320
I had to go for an internship and the internship,

1424
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:59.130
the internship that I was going for was at a,
where I go hunting at.

1425
01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:01.430
And I was like,
okay,
we'll do that.
But then like,

1426
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.080
people kept tagging me on Facebook about this wounded warrior fellowship

1427
01:21:04.081 --> 01:21:06.690
position that was opening up and he was like,
Matt,
you should try this out.

1428
01:21:06.691 --> 01:21:09.940
And I contacted one of my friends and he was like,
Hey,

1429
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.740
just show up at our office on this date and you could intern with us.

1430
01:21:13.741 --> 01:21:15.120
And then we'll talk about the position.

1431
01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:19.200
And I show up on the first day at our office and everybody's like,
who are you?

1432
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:22.920
I'm like,
and then he ended up getting kind of in trouble for this,
but,

1433
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:24.900
but it was,
uh,
so I,
you know,

1434
01:21:24.901 --> 01:21:29.901
I interned there and then went to the interview in June and basically was hired

1435
01:21:30.001 --> 01:21:30.600
on the spot.

1436
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.410
And I've been working with the congressional office for two years doing veterans

1437
01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:37.890
outreach.
Um,
you know,
we do some case work with veterans,

1438
01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:41.820
but truly just getting out in the district and being around veterans and kind of

1439
01:21:41.821 --> 01:21:44.060
letting them know what kind of legislative,
um,

1440
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:47.700
to bills are out there that could affect them both positive and negatively.

1441
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:50.250
I mean,
there's so much out there that they need to know about.

1442
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.460
And it's been truly a joy,
you know,

1443
01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:56.790
getting to work with a lot of Vietnam veterans and um,
you know,

1444
01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:59.910
these are some of the happiest guys that I've ever met in my life for what they

1445
01:21:59.911 --> 01:22:01.410
had to go through and you know,
and,

1446
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:05.310
and just hearing them walk up to me and be like,

1447
01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:10.460
cause I've had them come just to our office in tears just to like to shake my

1448
01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:13.630
hand or get a hug from me and stuff like that.
Going through,
you know,

1449
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:16.170
heart problems or whatever.
And they're like,
you know what,

1450
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:21.350
just being here and seeing you and what you've gone through that it motivates me

1451
01:22:21.361 --> 01:22:23.610
to continue doing what I'm doing.
Cause you're inspiring me.

1452
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:29.070
And it brings tears to my eyes because it's like,
you know,
as a veteran,
you know,

1453
01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.290
veterans serving veterans,
we need to look out for our own.

1454
01:22:31.291 --> 01:22:33.960
It doesn't matter if it's a job or not,
but you know,

1455
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:37.770
the suicide rate right now is sad.
And you know,

1456
01:22:37.771 --> 01:22:41.490
we got to learn to reach out and be with each other because we're the only ones

1457
01:22:41.491 --> 01:22:44.160
that trust and the only ones that will open up to each other.

1458
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:48.600
And that's the one thing that I've really,
you know,
I've tried at first,

1459
01:22:48.601 --> 01:22:53.580
which is very hard to keep my personal life from a work side.
But you know,

1460
01:22:53.581 --> 01:22:54.030
these,

1461
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:58.530
it's when you sat down and he talked to a veteran and you share what you've went

1462
01:22:58.531 --> 01:23:00.000
through and,

1463
01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:03.420
and they share what they went through and you kind of come together and you talk

1464
01:23:03.421 --> 01:23:05.280
about things and,
you know,

1465
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.650
at the end of the day that you're helping them out just as much as they're

1466
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:13.180
helping you out.
It truly means the world.
And it's,
it knows that,
you know,

1467
01:23:13.181 --> 01:23:15.310
veterans serving veterans,
we need stick together.

1468
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:18.970
There's no doubt.

1469
01:23:18.971 --> 01:23:23.440
And you're doing all of that and you're also raising three kids,

1470
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:28.120
three kids,
three amazing kids actually.
And,
uh,
you know,
my wife and I were,
uh,

1471
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:32.020
April 7th will be our seventh wedding anniversary.
So we're,
uh,

1472
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:36.700
but you know,
through it all,
the one thing that if I could teach anybody in life,

1473
01:23:36.701 --> 01:23:40.210
it's teaching those kids that,
you know,
challenges are going to come,

1474
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:44.600
but you got to find a way.
Life is an easy,
life's hard.
And,

1475
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:48.880
and if they could look at me and look at what I've gone through and what I

1476
01:23:48.881 --> 01:23:52.270
continue to do today,
and use that as motivation to,
you know,

1477
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:56.680
better themselves and better their lives and understand that,
yes,

1478
01:23:56.681 --> 01:23:58.390
I might have failed this test,
but you know what,

1479
01:23:58.391 --> 01:24:00.520
I'm going to go home and I want to get in a book and I want to,

1480
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:03.850
I'm going to get an a on this next one.
Then that's all that matters.
And,

1481
01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:07.600
you know,
talk about them a little bit is Nolan who's 15,

1482
01:24:07.601 --> 01:24:10.450
he'll turn 60 in a couple of weeks.
A couple of years ago,

1483
01:24:10.451 --> 01:24:12.850
we had a birthday party and,
and um,

1484
01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:18.330
there was this girl in his class or in his school that had no arms and no legs

1485
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:23.240
and he didn't know her,
but he went up to her and gave her a birthday.
Um,

1486
01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:24.803
uh,

1487
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:30.490
he invited her to his birthday and it like he come home and told me and Amanda

1488
01:24:30.491 --> 01:24:35.470
that and that truly brought tears to our eyes because it's like they get it,

1489
01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:40.470
you know,
when I was their age,
if I saw a kid that was in,
you know,

1490
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.280
a special ed class,
I didn't walk up and try to talk to him.
You know,

1491
01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:47.050
I felt like they were different than me and I stayed away from that.

1492
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.311
But you know,

1493
01:24:48.311 --> 01:24:52.060
no one that he walked up to a girl with no arms and no legs and was,
you know,

1494
01:24:52.061 --> 01:24:53.980
invited her to his birthday party,

1495
01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:57.130
truly brought tears to our eyes because it's like,
again,
he gets it.

1496
01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:01.450
He's growing up.
He's a man right now,
you know,
and Emma,

1497
01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:06.100
she is just as mature as she is.
So helpful and caring and compassionate.

1498
01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.940
And Layla is the same thing.
You know,
she's seven years old right now,

1499
01:25:09.941 --> 01:25:13.000
but it's the cutest thing in the world is the ear,

1500
01:25:13.001 --> 01:25:17.320
her get around her friends and tell her stories about how I got hurt.
You know,

1501
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:22.321
somehow the bad guys blew my legs off and killed me and you,

1502
01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.550
she told her teacher that.

1503
01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:26.200
And I can only imagine where teacher thought when I walked in the classroom,

1504
01:25:26.201 --> 01:25:30.760
you know,
but when it's just,
you know,
they're always there if I need them,

1505
01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.270
they're there to help out and you know,
to,
to my wife,

1506
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:37.300
I mean she's truly amazing.
She has a job herself,

1507
01:25:37.301 --> 01:25:41.920
but she stops everything she can to get me to work me to an event and me to a

1508
01:25:41.921 --> 01:25:46.570
speaking engagement to wherever get the three kids to wherever they need to go.

1509
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:51.430
Our two girls are in horseback riding lessons right now and still she finds time

1510
01:25:51.431 --> 01:25:56.350
to work out twice a day.
Actually.
She,
uh,
you know,

1511
01:25:56.351 --> 01:26:00.640
nine to nine to two job and,
and it's,
you know,

1512
01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:02.620
she's does dinner,
laundry,
everything.

1513
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.050
And then she still crawls in bed by eight o'clock at night.
I mean,
you know,

1514
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:09.950
if there's a motivation in my life and there's a true hero for me to look up to,

1515
01:26:09.951 --> 01:26:14.660
it's her because she is truly amazing and I couldn't ask for a better wife and a

1516
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:19.550
better friend,
best friend,
role model mentor and you know,

1517
01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:23.240
if there's any award out there to give to her then I mean I would,

1518
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.880
I would be up for it and I'd be the first one to sign onto it.

1519
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:32.650
<v 3>Awesome.
It sounds like you,
uh,
sounds like you found that the perfect,</v>

1520
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:34.150
the perfect girl for you.

1521
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:39.200
<v 2>She is in,
you know,
throughout all of this.
It's the hardest thing is to,</v>

1522
01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:43.550
to sit back and like appreciate it.
And the one thing that I truly don't like,

1523
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:47.450
I always cross if I cross the finish line,
always look to see what's next.

1524
01:26:47.451 --> 01:26:48.950
I don't sit back and enjoy it.

1525
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:54.430
And she's there to kind of like to almost honestly humble me a little bit and to

1526
01:26:55.250 --> 01:27:00.080
sit back and let me remember what I went through to get to where I am today.

1527
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.360
And without her,
I don't know if I could live this life right now.
And you know,

1528
01:27:05.361 --> 01:27:09.800
it's always talk about,
it's um,
you know,
it's a tough road.

1529
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.840
You know,
I'm,
I'm,
I am blind.

1530
01:27:11.841 --> 01:27:15.770
I have bad days and some days I don't want to wake up and go on,

1531
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.770
but I tell you every day,
you know,

1532
01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:23.750
or every night I pray that maybe one day I'll wake up and I'll be able to see my

1533
01:27:23.751 --> 01:27:25.880
wife and my kids.
And when I wake up,

1534
01:27:25.881 --> 01:27:30.530
I still look at darkness and then I go through my morning routine and I still

1535
01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:32.420
grab my prosthetic legs and I put them on.

1536
01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:35.900
So I'm constantly reminded of January 18th,
2007.

1537
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:39.920
And I use that motivation to go on and love my family and love my kids and go

1538
01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:43.340
out and do these extraordinary things because I'm never going to let that guy

1539
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:45.980
who pushed that button and blew me up to feed me,

1540
01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:48.080
even though I don't know where he's at right now,

1541
01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.560
he's never going to get the sense of relief that he defeated me that day.

1542
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:55.250
And you know,
while I'm going through these bad moments,
I mean,

1543
01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:59.540
nothing soothes the soul and makes the heart feel so much better than here.

1544
01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:03.230
And your seven year old daughter walk into you and say,
Hey Daddy,
I love you.

1545
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:10.020
<v 3>All right man.
Um,</v>

1546
01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.600
I don't even know if I have anything else to say after that,
man.

1547
01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:17.930
That's just a that's awesome.
Um,

1548
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:24.230
yeah man,
I think we're good.
Think we're good.
I think,

1549
01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.770
I think that's a good place to stop a man.

1550
01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:30.650
It's just awesome to,
uh,

1551
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:35.390
sit here and talk to you and hear your story.

1552
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.720
Um,
I know echoes got a couple of things to cover.

1553
01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.710
What do you got eco sure thing.
It,

1554
01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.920
I only think about this too.
Like,
you know how um,

1555
01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:51.980
Matt you're saying like you can choose to kind of go down two paths,
right?

1556
01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:54.060
So,
and it,

1557
01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:57.860
this picture starts to get a kind of painted in my head when I hear like these

1558
01:28:57.861 --> 01:29:00.680
cool stories.
So like,
I don't know,
you don't like,
if you're a,

1559
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:03.760
<v 4>it's going to be a bad analogy.</v>

1560
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:05.670
<v 3>Bear with,
we all know you're good at,
you know,</v>

1561
01:29:05.671 --> 01:29:07.260
we all know you're good at bad analogy.

1562
01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:12.120
<v 4>So let's say you're trying to,
I dunno,</v>

1563
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:16.680
like let's say you have an ant problem,
right?
You mean like little bugs?

1564
01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.370
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah,
my aunt.

1565
01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:25.160
Okay,
so let's say you have an ad problem,
right?
So it's,
it's,
it,

1566
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:28.620
it's you against the answer,
right?
So let's say you say,
okay,

1567
01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:32.350
I'm going to set up these traps for the list.
Let's say mice

1568
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:38.780
traps the mousetrap.
Let's say you put a mouse trap out for a year.

1569
01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:42.130
A mouse problem.
All right?
And then,
uh,
you know,

1570
01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:45.060
someone or a mouse comes and gets caught in the trap.

1571
01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:49.740
You don't kill it though.
You were trying to kill the all the mix,
right?

1572
01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:53.400
You don't kill the mouse,
the mouse,
like somehow you mess it up though,

1573
01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:57.390
but the mouse gets away.
So not only did you not kill the,

1574
01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:58.590
and then the mouse now goes,

1575
01:29:58.591 --> 01:30:03.591
recovers and now teaches all other mice how to get past mouse traps.

1576
01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:08.670
Okay.
Your mousetrap kind of worked against you.
So like,

1577
01:30:08.671 --> 01:30:13.470
just like when Matt said,
Oh yeah,
that guy who pressed the button to,
to,
you know,

1578
01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:14.304
to blow up the bomb.

1579
01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:17.290
<v 2>Yeah,
he hit me.
He did the opposite of what he was trying to do.</v>

1580
01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:20.260
See what I'm saying?
Oh,
I see what you're saying.
It's actually a good analogy.

1581
01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:24.130
Okay.
Credit for that one.
Not saying that Matt is a mouse.
I'm not saying that,

1582
01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:27.670
but I'm just saying,
you know,
come separately each as the,

1583
01:30:27.710 --> 01:30:31.270
the will and fortitude and the lessons.
Yeah,
most important.

1584
01:30:31.271 --> 01:30:34.810
So the guy who made the bomb kind of screwed himself,
you know what I mean?

1585
01:30:34.811 --> 01:30:39.550
In this big way.
And it's,
it's,
you know,
kind of,

1586
01:30:40.110 --> 01:30:44.000
it's hard to say that you just called me a mouse,
but it,
you know,

1587
01:30:44.001 --> 01:30:45.680
it's like at the end of the day it's like,
you know,

1588
01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:49.530
I look back at all altogether just being a marine,
you know,

1589
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.950
and never quit,

1590
01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:54.130
never quit on my brothers and never quitting on the situation it's given to me.

1591
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:59.550
And I'll use the amputation and the blondness and all this stuff stacked against

1592
01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:04.180
me as motivation,
you know?
And every now and then it like stairs,
it's ugly head.

1593
01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:07.930
But you know,
thankfully for my wife,
my family and you know,

1594
01:31:07.931 --> 01:31:10.600
the mindset and mentality that I have right now and the friends that I've

1595
01:31:10.601 --> 01:31:12.780
surrounded myself with that,
you know,

1596
01:31:12.781 --> 01:31:17.050
I kind of push it back and kick its butt if sir.

1597
01:31:18.490 --> 01:31:21.950
Indeed speaking of kicking butt,
yes.
What do you got for us?

1598
01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.740
Our path mats on the path he's been on the past.
Have you ever tried to,

1599
01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.340
to yet,
if you could teach a blind guy with no legs Jujitsu,
then I'm all for it.

1600
01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:30.920
Well,

1601
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:34.430
<v 3>I've definitely taught blind guys do Jitsu and I was definitely taught guys with</v>

1602
01:31:34.431 --> 01:31:36.950
no legs Jujitsu.
Let's put them together.
And I guess what,

1603
01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:43.280
I think you might find it easier than the Bataan death march.
Oh yeah,
no man,

1604
01:31:43.281 --> 01:31:47.330
you can definitely,
you can train a Jujitsu all day long.
Um,
Ryan job,
you know,

1605
01:31:47.331 --> 01:31:49.390
one of my guys who was blinded to,
uh,

1606
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:52.970
I trained with him and he wrestled two in high school,

1607
01:31:52.971 --> 01:31:56.450
so he had some background.
But yeah,
you can,

1608
01:31:56.690 --> 01:32:00.760
there's people that come competitively.
Um,
yeah that compete with,

1609
01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:05.380
with no vision and the no legs thing while that you just learned Jiu Jitsu is

1610
01:32:05.381 --> 01:32:08.260
adaptable.
Yeah.
Uh,
so you can,

1611
01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:11.290
you can adapt it as you as you are quite good at it.

1612
01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:15.960
<v 4>Well,
you know my hashtag no legs,
low vision,
no problem.
There you go out there,</v>

1613
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:19.330
I'll do it.
[inaudible] some Jujitsu training we used to do they,
you know,

1614
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.580
they say close your eyes and with your training you can start back to back

1615
01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:28.040
closer.
The thing is once you have contact with a day.
Yup.

1616
01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:32.500
Like being able to see him isn't that much of an advantage sometimes close my

1617
01:32:32.501 --> 01:32:33.334
eyes.

1618
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:38.020
<v 3>So yeah.
The thing with grappling is you learn well,</v>

1619
01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:42.040
you learn to know what the other person is doing by feel and you don't really

1620
01:32:42.041 --> 01:32:43.530
need because you can't see what are you going to see anyways?

1621
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:47.940
You see like their armpit
there.
Yeah.

1622
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:49.510
So you don't get to see much anyway.

1623
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:53.220
<v 4>The friend I was telling you about that that shrapnel in his leg and all rack I,</v>

1624
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:57.780
well I got a video of him and I are grappling and it's hard cause like I could

1625
01:32:57.781 --> 01:33:00.750
put them in a headlock but my legs,
I can't do much with that.

1626
01:33:00.751 --> 01:33:05.460
But they have a video of me like tapping him out cause he's like Bruh he bright

1627
01:33:05.461 --> 01:33:09.110
red.
It was like wow,

1628
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:11.880
<v 3>now a million people are going to want to see that video.
Yeah.</v>

1629
01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:13.270
It's a funny video.

1630
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:18.320
I mean that's the part you kind of miss is like the look of defeat on,
you know,

1631
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:21.010
on his face or whatever.
But you have to match to that part.

1632
01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.440
<v 4>Oh I'll let him know and the less the rest of the day and then also sent the</v>

1633
01:33:23.441 --> 01:33:28.280
picture to everybody that we started with.
So
it's out there so I'll,

1634
01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:32.260
so you'll roll right into it.
Plus you're a good athlete.

1635
01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:37.660
Tennis skills.
My wife's always going to love that you said that.

1636
01:33:39.690 --> 01:33:41.710
But yes,
on the path.
Very good.
You just do.

1637
01:33:41.711 --> 01:33:44.980
So when you're doing Jujitsu on this path that we're all on,
by the way,

1638
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.680
<v 3>you don't want to be,
if you do G,
which I recommend by,</v>

1639
01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:54.730
or this is where you get your gaze@originmain.com.
Gee,

1640
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:59.260
rash guard,
there's other stuff on there.
But as far as [inaudible] go,

1641
01:33:59.261 --> 01:34:02.350
that's where you get them all made in America by the way,
Jocko.
Yeah,

1642
01:34:02.351 --> 01:34:03.250
that's the big thing.

1643
01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:08.820
So little town up in Maine and all the industry was taken away from this town.

1644
01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:16.540
And um,
we're bringing it back.
We've got a factory up there.
We got,

1645
01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:17.653
I think we've got,

1646
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:20.500
well we've got a bunch of people working in the factory and they're all

1647
01:34:20.501 --> 01:34:23.170
craftsmen,
craftsmen and craftswomen

1648
01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.620
Crespi cause a lot of them are female.
Um,
and you know,
they're,

1649
01:34:29.621 --> 01:34:30.550
they're making all this stuff.

1650
01:34:30.551 --> 01:34:35.380
So it's great to see that we're trying to make America make again.

1651
01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:40.070
Did you just is,
I just know I shot that to Pete,

1652
01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:44.560
my brother Pete.
I was like,
Hey,
we're gonna make America make again.

1653
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.240
He did it because that's what we're trying to do.

1654
01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.360
We're trying to make America make stuff happening.

1655
01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:52.640
I mean we got what Dan [inaudible],
American denim.
Yeah.

1656
01:34:53.230 --> 01:34:56.840
Not the kind that's the plans for the future,
which is good by the way.

1657
01:34:56.841 --> 01:34:59.630
The plans for the future.
Good future pilots.
But that's not a future plan.

1658
01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:00.950
We like to seed your parents,

1659
01:35:00.951 --> 01:35:05.680
but we really like actual this is happening production.

1660
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.090
Yeah.
I think about it.

1661
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:12.470
American jeans or ma or created in America,

1662
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:13.843
created here,

1663
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:18.690
invented here and all of a sudden they're getting made overseas and these and

1664
01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:20.930
there's no Americans that are making me anymore.
Well there are now,

1665
01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:26.760
there are now in a factory in Farmington,
Maine.
That's what we're doing.
Yes.

1666
01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:31.070
Origin main.com.
Go there.
Geek rash guards,

1667
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:36.071
denim joggers go install stuff and some boy up.

1668
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.570
So I'm bad.
Amen.
I twisted my knee out doing Jujitsu.

1669
01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:45.410
Like the kind that popped up popped back hands.
They do that.
They're skinny.
Yes,

1670
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:49.610
but they're loose to shamelessly James.
Actually,

1671
01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:52.010
my needs are so low.
I can with the needs.
I know,

1672
01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:56.600
but my knees are so loose that I um,
I like sprained it one time.

1673
01:35:56.601 --> 01:35:59.180
So I went to the orthopedic surgeon,
you know,
check it out.
He was like,
Oh yeah,

1674
01:35:59.181 --> 01:36:00.990
you blew your ACL.
That was like,

1675
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:06.850
since I really did blow my ACL 10 to 12 to 15 years earlier,

1676
01:36:07.071 --> 01:36:10.970
my other side,
I knew that my knees were loose because the guy,

1677
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:13.560
the doctor at that time,
it was like,
hey,
you have real like I dunno,

1678
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:17.370
long ligaments.
I don't know.
See,
I know that sounds funny,
like long ligaments.

1679
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:21.560
I know,
but that's what he said.
Anyway,
so I was like,
Hey,

1680
01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:23.130
I'm sure he just didn't say you had.

1681
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:28.620
Anyway.
He says,
um,

1682
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:31.580
yeah you have loose like ligaments or whatever.
Um,

1683
01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:34.340
but this is how you know this one is blown out and this one is not.

1684
01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.440
Because when you pull it the one that's not blown out,

1685
01:36:36.441 --> 01:36:40.920
Bowman has a tight like chord at the end of it where it just stops.
Anyways.

1686
01:36:40.921 --> 01:36:43.580
So my current orthopedic surgeon and I told him that he was like,
okay,

1687
01:36:43.581 --> 01:36:46.400
that's good that you told me that.
So he tries the other one,
I'm like,
he's like,

1688
01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:51.380
oh yeah,
they're the same.
So it's probably not blown out.
But Hey,
Mri.
Anyway,

1689
01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:56.440
Mri.
Anyway,
back to my story.
So they pop out.
Right.

1690
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:58.970
That's their thing.
When I twist them wrong,
they'll pop out.

1691
01:36:58.990 --> 01:37:02.330
Sometimes it'll pop out so much that it'll like kind of make the cartilage swell

1692
01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.610
on the outside.
Okay.
So it takes a few days.

1693
01:37:05.611 --> 01:37:10.070
So like until I can bend them all away and I'm pretty flexible by the way on the

1694
01:37:10.071 --> 01:37:10.880
less,

1695
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:15.880
once I did that double dose joint warfare and Krill oil for dates back in again.

1696
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.130
That's,
that's quick.
That's quick for us.
We get them a milk.

1697
01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.370
Yes.
Additional protein.
Yup.
Additional protein.

1698
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:29.810
We've got the discipline go and the discipline and we've got the warrior kid

1699
01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:33.140
milk.
I've got to get you some warrior kid.
Moca for your kids.
Matt.

1700
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:37.730
Toughen them up.
So what it is is it's like,
do your kids like chocolate milk?

1701
01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:40.340
They do.
Do they like,
do you have,
have strawberry chocolate?

1702
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:42.920
Well what does that smell?
Strawberry milk.
Do you ever have that one?

1703
01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:46.330
My Layla seven year old.
She loves strawberry milk.
Okay.

1704
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:49.280
So unfortunately the milk,

1705
01:37:49.281 --> 01:37:52.460
the strawberry milk that you have to give your kids is horrible for him even

1706
01:37:52.461 --> 01:37:56.160
though it tastes delicious,
I guess.
Well,
there's like some protein in it,
right?

1707
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.170
<v 0>There's some nutritional value because it doesn't have some protein cause</v>

1708
01:37:58.171 --> 01:38:02.820
there's milk in it,
but you're also laid running them with sugar,

1709
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.870
which is not good for him.
So yeah,
and it's addictive.

1710
01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:11.430
So we solved this problem and we made warrior kid milk.

1711
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:15.030
It tastes delicious.
I'm telling you it tastes like,

1712
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.980
I don't know if I'm supposed to say this,

1713
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.590
but it tastes like the Nestle's Quik strawberry milk.

1714
01:38:19.591 --> 01:38:22.410
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
It tastes like it's that good.

1715
01:38:22.411 --> 01:38:26.610
I'm not kidding.
Layla will be all over this stuff.

1716
01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.240
She will be stoked if they like strawberry.
Yeah,
really good.

1717
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.770
So we'll get you some of that.

1718
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:35.280
And anyone else out there that wants to raise a warrior,

1719
01:38:35.281 --> 01:38:40.050
kids that doesn't want to give your kid a bunch of actual poison sugar.

1720
01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.190
Actual poison.

1721
01:38:41.890 --> 01:38:45.090
<v 4>Yeah.
And here's the thing about sugar too and sure,</v>

1722
01:38:45.130 --> 01:38:48.860
I ran a little thing about this,
but I have noticed this.
So you know how like,
um,

1723
01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.110
when you're there,
like little babies or whatever,
you'll give them like,
I dunno,

1724
01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.960
all kinds of stuff and let's say you give him formula,

1725
01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:58.420
but the form is kind of sweet in,
right?

1726
01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:02.020
So it's like it's sweet in so they'll like it so they'll eat it.
Oh yeah.

1727
01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:05.770
But if you don't give them any sweet stuff,
even when they grow up,
they'll like,

1728
01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:10.210
they'll only eat normal stuff like unsweetened stuff,
you know.

1729
01:39:10.630 --> 01:39:15.100
So I'll use myself as a small example when I was young,
my parent,
you know,
the,

1730
01:39:15.101 --> 01:39:18.400
you know,
the like the fruit,
not fruit punch,
but like a orange juice concentrate.

1731
01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:19.660
When you make orange juice,

1732
01:39:19.661 --> 01:39:24.280
you put orange juice concert and then you get a water.
Yes,
yes.
What it all is.

1733
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:32.140
But how you do it is you go,
um,
it's like a 12 ounce concentrate.
We'll say,

1734
01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:34.620
we'll say,
I think it's 12 ounces,
but the concentrated,

1735
01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.050
and then you feel that same 12 ounce container that the concentration was in

1736
01:39:39.130 --> 01:39:43.930
with water four times.
Right?
Little did I know it was really three times.

1737
01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.950
That's how much you're supposed to,
that's the recommended.

1738
01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:50.130
But my mom always did the four times.
She was trying to save money too.
Oh yeah,

1739
01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:55.000
yeah.
I'm sure that was part of it.
Well,
she was like six event.

1740
01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.050
None the less I was used to it,
I was totally used to it.

1741
01:39:59.051 --> 01:40:01.150
So then later on when I found out in high school,

1742
01:40:01.151 --> 01:40:05.260
by the way that it was really a three,
I was like,
Bro,
I can't do the three.

1743
01:40:05.261 --> 01:40:07.540
It's way too sweet.
Yeah.
Your mom seem sane,

1744
01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:09.820
saved money and made you more healthy.

1745
01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:17.530
The right path.
Yeah.
See,
I'll think about that.

1746
01:40:17.650 --> 01:40:20.410
And when you think about that,
think about this.
Jocko has a store,

1747
01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.820
it's called chocolate store.

1748
01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:24.730
So when you're on the path you want to represent while being on the path,

1749
01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:28.660
that's where you go.
You can get your tee shirts,
discipline equals freedom.
Good.

1750
01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:32.090
Good shirt.
Oh,
the new one on there.

1751
01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:36.550
The new good shirt with less simple,
less of my head on it.

1752
01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:40.750
It is weird,
especially after a while when you know,

1753
01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:43.330
you look in the mirror and it's like,
good.
Yeah.
Get the message.

1754
01:40:43.331 --> 01:40:45.480
But you got to see chocolates face or whatever.
And you know,

1755
01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:48.010
sometimes you're not in the mood for that.
You just get the other one.

1756
01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:52.440
Did you show your tee tee shirts anywhere?
Math there on my website.
And uh,
we're,

1757
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:54.070
we're in the process getting right now.
He's

1758
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:58.810
<v 2>got the cotton shirts,
but we're working on a workout shirts as well.
And um,</v>

1759
01:40:59.080 --> 01:40:59.630
but yet,

1760
01:40:59.630 --> 01:41:04.340
<v 3>and that's Matthew bradford.com.
Matthew Dash breath myself,</v>

1761
01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.160
Matthew Dash at Bradford.

1762
01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:10.670
<v 2>Yeah,
there's there on there as well.
And um,</v>

1763
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:15.470
you can also go on there and request speaking engagements as well and look me,

1764
01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.580
but yeah.
But yeah,
the shirts are there and Hashtag on the front of them.

1765
01:41:21.250 --> 01:41:25.150
<v 3>And the Hashtag on the front has no vision,
no legs,
no problem,
no legs,
no vision,</v>

1766
01:41:25.151 --> 01:41:28.310
no problem.
Going to prioritize.
It's a different,

1767
01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.380
<v 2>it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's hilarious hearing people,
um,</v>

1768
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:36.300
just go after the Hashtag.
It's like no sight,
no legs and no vacation,

1769
01:41:37.290 --> 01:41:41.490
no eyes.
It's like,
first of all,
I've got one at the prosthetic but,

1770
01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.820
but uh,
yeah,
it's uh,
it's,
you know,

1771
01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:47.520
that's something I come up with like a couple of years ago like doing an event

1772
01:41:47.521 --> 01:41:49.980
and it's like,
you know what,
it just kind of stuck.
And next thing you know,

1773
01:41:49.981 --> 01:41:53.340
here we go.
No legs,
no vision,
no problem.
And those uh,

1774
01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:55.850
the workout shirts who talking about what do you,
um,

1775
01:41:56.100 --> 01:42:00.150
what like dry fit kind of situation and what Kelly could dry fit.

1776
01:42:00.151 --> 01:42:02.640
But then also the discipline equals freedom tee shirt.

1777
01:42:02.641 --> 01:42:04.080
The Wa the material y'all use.

1778
01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:09.150
Now the really liked that material cause I feel like when I work out a get good

1779
01:42:09.151 --> 01:42:11.940
numbers and I've got to discipline equals freedom tee shirt on.

1780
01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.980
<v 3>Oh yeah,
you were on placebo.</v>

1781
01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.720
You know,
it's one of those things,
right?
It's like,
what do you call it?

1782
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:24.930
Let me ask you this.
If the placebo well is works,

1783
01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.720
is it really a placebo because that's,
you know,
made that later.
I don't want

1784
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:35.320
Matzo vacations.
We went to get somebody else in here for that one.

1785
01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:39.590
Echo is going to start telling the story about like Koolaid or something.

1786
01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:45.320
How much water goes,
maybe.
Maybe.
Anyway,

1787
01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:48.860
you want to represent on the path Jocko,

1788
01:42:48.861 --> 01:42:53.240
store.com if you see something you like,
get something.
How's this?
How's this?
Yes.

1789
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:57.350
Lightweight hoodies.
Oh,
they're in.
Oh,
I know.
They're in,
they're up.

1790
01:42:57.530 --> 01:43:00.860
They're representative of quality.

1791
01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:06.350
Little Stash.
A fash.
Oh,
I'm going to say,
see Matt,
you're probably down.

1792
01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:10.580
So he's wearing situation,
right?
Living in Kentucky.

1793
01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.790
Yeah,
exactly right.
More often.
You're going to need that in Kentucky,

1794
01:43:13.791 --> 01:43:17.520
but it's kind of my main,
you're not going to need that lightweight hoodie.

1795
01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:20.020
All right,
well I'm going to the immersion camp.
I'm bring one.

1796
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:23.300
I'm going to wear one.
How about that?
Emerging camp.
Merging immersion.

1797
01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:25.100
Immersion camp.
The origin immersion camp.

1798
01:43:25.101 --> 01:43:26.990
We haven't talked about that because it's almost sold out.

1799
01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:32.440
Go to [inaudible] dot com if you want to go to that Jujitsu camp.

1800
01:43:32.610 --> 01:43:35.110
If you want to come to that,
Matt,
let me know.
When am I going to get,

1801
01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.350
it's an August.
It's uh,
it's fun.

1802
01:43:39.351 --> 01:43:41.870
We do Jujitsu 24 hours a day.

1803
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:48.050
We did it.
We rocked it.
It was a good time.
Jocko white tea,

1804
01:43:48.051 --> 01:43:51.770
you can get that as well.
If you can't dead lift eight pounds,

1805
01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:55.040
you might want to order to quickly because if you drink Jocko white tea,

1806
01:43:55.190 --> 01:43:59.540
there's a 100% scientific guarantee that you'll be able to dead lift a minimum

1807
01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:02.630
of 8,000 pounds.
Some people are coming in higher than that,
which is fine.

1808
01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.700
Not a placebo.
No,
no,
no.
It's 100% uh,

1809
01:44:08.410 --> 01:44:08.870
looking back,

1810
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:13.460
you can subscribe to this podcast because Echo thinks that you've listened to

1811
01:44:13.461 --> 01:44:16.700
171 podcast and maybe you haven't hit subscribe yet.

1812
01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.110
That's an accurate thing and unfortunately for me,

1813
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:22.520
go echo is proven right because then a bunch of people,

1814
01:44:22.521 --> 01:44:26.270
when I made fun of you for that,
a bunch of people rallied to your defense.

1815
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:30.560
There's a whole little group that will rally to your different because they have

1816
01:44:30.561 --> 01:44:32.410
a good point sometimes,
not all the time.

1817
01:44:34.890 --> 01:44:39.140
Come on a subscriber.
Also,
don't forget about the warrior kid podcast.

1818
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.980
We just released a couple more episodes,
stories from Uncle Jake.

1819
01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:47.210
I love those stories.
I'm going to publish a book with those stories,
by the way.

1820
01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:51.650
A good idea.
Yeah,
I know.
It's a big shocker.
Don't forget to wear your kids.

1821
01:44:51.651 --> 01:44:55.760
So from Irish oats,
coke's ranch,
actually it's not for kids.

1822
01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.640
It's so made by a kid,
but it's not for kids.

1823
01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:03.630
It's for humans in general that need to stay clean.

1824
01:45:04.630 --> 01:45:06.260
Yes.
Also,
Youtube,

1825
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.850
if you are interested in the video version of this podcast,

1826
01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.960
you want to see what Matt looks like?
Yeah.
Boy.
See what chocolate looks like

1827
01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:21.620
and uh,
yeah,
I was explaining to Matt.
I'll explain to everyone.
As everyone knows,

1828
01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.950
echo does not sound like he looks like,
you know,

1829
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:30.260
we all know that echo sounds just,
I'm just going to say it.

1830
01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:34.880
Echo sound skinny and weak.
Thank you.

1831
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.400
I don't mean that in a bad way.
Hey,
no offense,
but echo sounds.

1832
01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:44.000
My kids always make fun of that.
Hey,
no offense,

1833
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.160
but I'm going to say something.

1834
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:50.720
So I was explaining to Matt,
I'm like,
listen bro,

1835
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:54.560
most people when they see echo and they meet him,
they go,
okay,
cool.

1836
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:56.270
He's not really,
they think to themselves,
oh,
he's not.

1837
01:45:56.271 --> 01:45:58.970
He's going to look like the way he sounds.
Yeah.
So I had to say Matt,

1838
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:03.470
I know you can't see echo,
but he doesn't look the way he sounds.

1839
01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:09.280
Matt was like,
okay,
cool.
Thanks.
Cause otherwise,
no,
he's,
you know,

1840
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:10.790
he might've said something like,
you know,

1841
01:46:10.791 --> 01:46:15.040
maybe if you're trying to put on weight,
like maybe echo needs to your voice.

1842
01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:17.030
Sounds like you maybe need to do some squats.

1843
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:21.511
<v 4>When I was in the hospital,</v>

1844
01:46:21.511 --> 01:46:24.260
I had like a color that every time I would make fun of somebody,

1845
01:46:24.261 --> 01:46:26.640
then they would be in the room and I didn't know that.
Then they'd be like blue,

1846
01:46:26.641 --> 01:46:31.500
blue,
blue.
It's like getting my mind off of like what I was going to say.
Like,
oh,

1847
01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.840
okay.
Why you say color right now?

1848
01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:40.080
<v 3>Oh,
that's good.
Yeah.
That is good.
Actually.
Youtube videos,</v>

1849
01:46:40.110 --> 01:46:44.190
there's also echos enhanced youtube video.
Just the one up today.
Yup.

1850
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:48.400
I should technically be quiet yesterday,
Monday,
Monday.
Those are good.
Uh,

1851
01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:52.770
checkout side,
canvas.com.
That's a little company.

1852
01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.840
But my brother,
Dakota Meyer,

1853
01:46:55.470 --> 01:47:00.470
he's making a cool things to hang on your wall of highest quality made in

1854
01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:09.090
America.
He made one that says good.
Yeah.
If that's a message that you,

1855
01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:12.630
that resonates with,
you can do that.
Uh,

1856
01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.480
we just got one that says discipline equals freedom.
And by the way,

1857
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:17.160
I didn't really know this until the other day,

1858
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:20.970
and I hate to even do this because,
uh,
Dakota might get mad at me,

1859
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.820
but he kinda takes requests.

1860
01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:28.770
So if you heard something on this podcast and you said to yourself,
Dang,
when,

1861
01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:32.790
when Matt Bradford said this,
when Matt Bradford said,

1862
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:37.040
just walk.
I mean,
can that not become,
that can be,

1863
01:47:37.041 --> 01:47:39.330
that's like something that you'd kind of want to put on your wall,
right?

1864
01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:43.740
Just walk.
So if there's something like that,

1865
01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:48.500
hit up to code on Twitter and say,
Hey Dakota,
wouldn't it be cool if there was a,

1866
01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:52.930
uh,
a canvas that said,
just walk?
He's can,

1867
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:55.680
you might have to put like a request like

1868
01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.720
this to filter that one out.

1869
01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.360
It's true that there's some good stuff on there.

1870
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:05.530
I went through it and was like looking at it.

1871
01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:09.750
There's good men and I'm not really an artsy guy as far as hanging art on the

1872
01:48:09.751 --> 01:48:14.390
wall.
You ever been in a hotel?
It has like a picture of like a cat,
you know,

1873
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.770
and I see what they're doing.
They trying to make you feel cozy,

1874
01:48:16.771 --> 01:48:20.600
but it's like probably this is a random picture of it and this thing and I don't

1875
01:48:20.601 --> 01:48:24.890
know.
But yeah,
you get that,
that good one that we have that he has on.
Okay.

1876
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:27.930
I can kind of get down with this.
Even just the looks alone for sure.

1877
01:48:27.931 --> 01:48:29.070
And then you've got another layer,

1878
01:48:29.071 --> 01:48:33.780
the good aesthetically pleasing and there's layers and layers.
Exactly right.

1879
01:48:33.781 --> 01:48:35.470
We've been talking about layers in quite some time.

1880
01:48:36.210 --> 01:48:41.010
Use the layer talk you did,
but you know payments you probably my fault.

1881
01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:44.910
Also psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what that is,

1882
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:48.450
it's an album with tracks of Jocko getting you,
getting us,

1883
01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:52.020
getting all of us through our moments of weakness,
whatever they may be.

1884
01:48:52.170 --> 01:48:57.170
So checked out that one that's on like an Amazon and Pete three spot where you

1885
01:48:57.391 --> 01:49:00.480
get mp3s,
you understand iTunes,
all that stuff.
That's where you get,

1886
01:49:00.481 --> 01:49:04.200
it's really good also on it.

1887
01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:08.160
So if you're expanding your home gym still,
which we all are,

1888
01:49:08.161 --> 01:49:13.140
that's an ongoing thing.
I understand.
Get your kettle bells rings.
What else?

1889
01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:18.170
These mesas and clubs really good for your creative type workouts unless you,

1890
01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:22.350
unless you want to keep up boring work.
I like Jocko.
I mean that's,

1891
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:26.010
it's up to you.
Whatever your workouts that you'd like to do the same thing.

1892
01:49:26.011 --> 01:49:29.640
Do you varied up all the time.
I got things I like going back to like,

1893
01:49:29.641 --> 01:49:33.510
I love doing bench press and pull ups and dips,

1894
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:35.910
but I do like change it up every now and then.

1895
01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:39.470
But you were talking big time about the chains.
That's Kinda,

1896
01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:44.040
it's Kinda like legit isn't it?
It's kind of dope.

1897
01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:46.650
Like looking to when,
when like while you're working out with them,

1898
01:49:46.651 --> 01:49:47.380
but what that does,

1899
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:52.240
it offers this kind of offsetting like weight to you and to what you're doing

1900
01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:55.670
and it's,
yeah,
it's good.
Especially when you change.
Would you do my pull ups to,

1901
01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.870
they're hard,
but yeah,
I'd love,

1902
01:49:58.930 --> 01:50:01.750
love making them our workouts even harder than it really is.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1903
01:50:01.751 --> 01:50:06.160
That's all right.
You go wait,
the weight liquor on Rob Jones says boom.
But yeah,

1904
01:50:06.161 --> 01:50:09.040
that's where you go on it.com actually,
you know what here,
how's this?

1905
01:50:09.041 --> 01:50:10.110
The perfect mix.

1906
01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:14.740
Morning mix or pre workout mix like before Jujitsu be so on.
It has these,

1907
01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:20.220
they're minerals or electrolyte minerals mix that two scoops of discipline water

1908
01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:27.070
and if you know I put a five hour energy every once in a while I want,
I want,

1909
01:50:27.071 --> 01:50:29.740
I like a boost or whatever,
but all you need those minerals,

1910
01:50:29.741 --> 01:50:34.270
the discipline water and Oh that's when you take like your Krill oil and all

1911
01:50:34.271 --> 01:50:38.170
that stuff.
Boom.
Perfect mix.
Interesting.
Yeah.
Trey,

1912
01:50:38.171 --> 01:50:42.910
it Ellen and guy,
I got a bunch of books to Mike in the dragons.

1913
01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.820
I got these books where I brought these up for your kids to Matt,

1914
01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:47.200

1917
01:51:00.461 --> 01:51:04.390

three platforms,
extreme ownership.

1921
01:51:14.531 --> 01:51:18.220
First Book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin followup to that is the dichotomy

1922
01:51:18.221 --> 01:51:19.660
of leadership.
We've got echelon front,

1923
01:51:19.661 --> 01:51:23.680
which is leadership consultancy and what we do is work with businesses to solve

1924
01:51:23.681 --> 01:51:25.660
problems through leadership.

1925
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:30.130

I did last year.
And um,
Washington DC.

1929
01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.660
I actually like it.
I loved it.

1930
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:47.950
I loved going there and thank you and life were inviting me to join you all.

1931
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:49.390
It was awesome to have you there.

1932
01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:54.930
Did you relate or did you recognize the leadership lessons?

1933
01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:59.830
It's amazing.
Like,
like,
cause you don't think about it too much,
but you know,

1934
01:51:59.831 --> 01:52:02.890
it's,
it's different terminology but it all means the same.

1935
01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:07.230
And I love how like prioritize and execute and all this stuff,
you know,

1936
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:12.070
going back to the military side of it and it kind of keeps you back in the fight

1937
01:52:12.071 --> 01:52:15.940
a little bit.
And so I do go back to work and like,
all right,

1938
01:52:15.941 --> 01:52:20.320
this is how you should lead.
You know?
And it's weird too.
I,
I was,
um,

1939
01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:21.580
I always think about leadership.

1940
01:52:21.581 --> 01:52:23.770
It's always in my head and I always think about military stuff.

1941
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:29.790
And actually I was listening to you talk about getting blown up and you were

1942
01:52:30.371 --> 01:52:32.950
talking about how you guys had good dispersion.

1943
01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:35.950
And what that means is you're separate from each other.

1944
01:52:35.951 --> 01:52:39.850
That way if something blows up or you get hit with a mortar machine and machine

1945
01:52:39.851 --> 01:52:43.960
gun fire,
if everyone's too close together,
then you get multiple wounded.

1946
01:52:43.961 --> 01:52:46.100
So you have to,
you have to have spacing.
Now

1947
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.290
<v 0>obviously there's a dichotomy because if you have too much spacing,</v>

1948
01:52:48.291 --> 01:52:50.510
then you can't see each other.
You can't help each other,

1949
01:52:50.511 --> 01:52:52.490
you can't get to each other and you can't communicate with each other.

1950
01:52:52.491 --> 01:52:53.324
So there's a dichotomy,

1951
01:52:53.690 --> 01:52:58.690
but we used to use this real simple corrective statement and it's real simple.

1952
01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:02.240
Don't bunch up,
don't bunch up,
don't bunch up.

1953
01:53:02.241 --> 01:53:07.241
Like if you see guys patrolling and they like one guy hits a little bit of an

1954
01:53:08.031 --> 01:53:11.180
obstacle and so it takes them a couple extra seconds to get over.

1955
01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:14.510
You fast forward that times eight guys and all of a sudden there's five guys

1956
01:53:14.511 --> 01:53:16.220
sitting on this obstacle.
They're trying to get through it,

1957
01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:18.660
I guess where the enemy puts a landmine,

1958
01:53:18.710 --> 01:53:21.050
they put it by that obstacle because they know you're going to get punched up,

1959
01:53:21.490 --> 01:53:25.460
you're in a gunfight and you see there's a little piece of cover or sometimes

1960
01:53:25.461 --> 01:53:26.930
there's not even covered,
but everyone just,

1961
01:53:26.931 --> 01:53:30.410
you get the instincts that if we're closer,

1962
01:53:30.411 --> 01:53:35.270
we're for safety and so I would,
when I was running training,
always be saying,

1963
01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:39.790
don't bunch up.
Don't bunch up.
Now how does that apply to leadership?
I can x.

1964
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:44.540
It hit me the other day as I was working out.
As a matter of fact,
don't bond.

1965
01:53:44.541 --> 01:53:49.160
Jump on leadership.
What does that mean?
That means if you're leading echo,

1966
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:52.700
I need to let you lead.
I don't need to come in there and lead to,

1967
01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:54.950
I don't need to get right up and bunch up on you.

1968
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:58.280
So when someone steps up and takes leadership,
don't bunch up.

1969
01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:01.370
Let him give him some space,
let him move and follow them.

1970
01:54:01.610 --> 01:54:02.660
And there's nothing wrong with that.

1971
01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:06.770
So these things that I learned in the military that Matt learned in the
military,

1972
01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:07.130
when you,

1973
01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:10.010
when you look at them from a leadership perspective outside the military,

1974
01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:13.160
they still apply.
So if you want to learn about some of that stuff,

1975
01:54:13.161 --> 01:54:15.230
come to the monster,
um,

1976
01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:20.180
extreme ownership.com for details f online.
Maybe you can't come to the muster.

1977
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:23.870
Maybe you're too busy,
maybe you don't have that much money,
right?

1978
01:54:23.871 --> 01:54:26.690
And maybe you can't get the time off.
Maybe you can't travel that far.

1979
01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:31.310
There's a bunch of reasons and we know that and we don't like that.

1980
01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:35.210
So what,
what we did is we made ETF online.

1981
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.290
It is online interactive leadership training.
It's,

1982
01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:43.460
it's me and the rest of the echelon front team showing you,

1983
01:54:43.461 --> 01:54:48.461
teaching you about the principles of leadership that we learned in combat and

1984
01:54:48.471 --> 01:54:51.080
it's available right now.
If you want to go check it out,

1985
01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:56.060
f online.com and finally we've got f Overwatch,

1986
01:54:56.061 --> 01:55:01.061
which is us connecting leaders from the military,

1987
01:55:01.610 --> 01:55:04.730
from special operations,
from combat aviation,

1988
01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:10.240
and we're connecting them with companies in the civilian sector that need

1989
01:55:10.581 --> 01:55:11.180
leaders.

1990
01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:16.180
And this is one thing I've started to say is when people,

1991
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:18.980
people always ask,
well,
I want to hire the right person.
How do I do it?

1992
01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.570
Hire the leader.

1993
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:25.790
You're going to want to hire somebody that has experience as a leader.

1994
01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:29.840
Just because someone is good at some technical thing doesn't mean that they're

1995
01:55:29.841 --> 01:55:33.050
going to be good at leadership.
It doesn't work that way.
So you,

1996
01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:38.230
it's better to hire somebody that has leadership capability rather than anti.

1997
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:40.700
And then you take that person that has leadership capability and you teach them

1998
01:55:40.701 --> 01:55:42.620
what they need to know about the industry that you're in.

1999
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:47.830
So you could have somebody that was in the the special forces and you say,

2000
01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:52.860
Oh,
I'm going to hire him to run this communications sales group.

2001
01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.870
He doesn't know anything about communication sales group.

2002
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:55.793
I'll tell you what though.

2003
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:59.430
You give him like a month and a half digging in deep and you'll learn
everything.

2004
01:55:59.431 --> 01:56:03.510
He's got to know anything to apply the leadership things that he knows from his

2005
01:56:03.511 --> 01:56:08.511
military service into that position and he's gonna win.

2006
01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:09.780
He's gonna make it happen.

2007
01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:15.000
What I realized that it's not to be confused with boss like Leah,

2008
01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.820
when you say people leadership experiences,
for sure.

2009
01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:19.980
They won't roll in and be like,

2010
01:56:19.981 --> 01:56:22.950
I'm the boss now since I was putting the special forces it and you know it's not

2011
01:56:22.951 --> 01:56:27.600
that because they're humble because we're only bringing people in through e,

2012
01:56:27.630 --> 01:56:29.940
f,
F,
F,
F,
Overwatch.

2013
01:56:29.941 --> 01:56:33.810
We're only bringing people in that understand the principles that we talk about

2014
01:56:33.811 --> 01:56:36.730
an extreme ownership,
which none of that has to do with being a boss.
Yeah.

2015
01:56:37.230 --> 01:56:41.540
I have a thing where I had no,
my wife often I can understand.
Yes.

2016
01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:46.410
One of the most annoying things that I can do to her is I'll act like I'm not

2017
01:56:46.411 --> 01:56:49.410
listening to anyone.
No one can have any influence on me whatsoever.

2018
01:56:50.010 --> 01:56:55.010
And so she had some conference thing that I was supposed to go to and she's

2019
01:56:56.581 --> 01:56:59.340
sending me these,
you know,
she's sending me like,
Hey,

2020
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:02.520
we're supposed to be there at six o'clock.
I'm like,
I'll show up when I want to.

2021
01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.490
And then my little daughter,

2022
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:09.540
she always takes my wife's side cause she hasn't quite figured out my sense of

2023
01:57:09.541 --> 01:57:12.690
humor yet.
And so my daughter was like,
dad,

2024
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:15.480
you need to do what mom says you need to go,
wouldn't you don't?

2025
01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:19.120
She said six o'clock.
And I was like,
they're not the boss of me.

2026
01:57:20.590 --> 01:57:23.900
So my little daughter was all mad at me for a little while and then she realized

2027
01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:26.400
I was joking.
Now she goes,
dad's not serious.

2028
01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:32.220
Dad's not sir.
He's kidding.
I now I've gone too far where,
you know,

2029
01:57:32.221 --> 01:57:35.410
like clean your room.
She's like,
Oh,
you're just kidding.
Not Jokes,

2030
01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:41.700
jokes on you.
Um,
so a,
if you want to hang around with us a little bit more,

2031
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:46.620
you can find all of us virtually on the interwebs.

2032
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:48.240
So Matt is,

2033
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:53.510
you're already here is website Matthew Dash or Matthew Hyphen Bradford,

2034
01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:58.140
I think that's right.
Matthew.
Matthew.
Oh and there's also two teas.

2035
01:57:58.470 --> 01:58:01.860
Is that a thing?
Is there are two ways to spell Matthew or am I just dumb?

2036
01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:07.830
Is it always have two tease?
That's the common way
I won't,

2037
01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:09.100
I won't emphasize it.

2038
01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:11.490
I thought I had to emphasize that there was two t's in there.

2039
01:58:11.670 --> 01:58:16.670
So Matthew Hyphen bradford.com is where you can check out Matt for tee shirts

2040
01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:24.060
for booking him as a speaker for seeing what he's up to.

2041
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:28.200
He's also bionic.
Matt five number five.

2042
01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:31.860
Bionic spelled wrong with the kid with a k.

2043
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:33.360
I wanted to be young and hip,

2044
01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:37.870
you know for sure that screams young and hip for sure.

2045
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:41.200
I'm getting up there in age.
I got to keep you on know

2046
01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.430
<v 3>and maths post posting all if you,
if you want to,</v>

2047
01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:47.170
if you're feeling sorry for yourself at all.

2048
01:58:47.171 --> 01:58:52.171
Checkout in and follow bionic spelled with a K.

2049
01:58:52.450 --> 01:58:55.720
Matt.
Number five was the number five four.
That was my football number.

2050
01:58:56.890 --> 01:59:01.290
If you want to take about a graduate high school in no five so [inaudible] is

2051
01:59:01.570 --> 01:59:03.910
right there and there's also a,
I do.
My wife

2052
01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:07.500
<v 2>created it here recently to a new Facebook public page.
No legs,
no vision,</v>

2053
01:59:07.501 --> 01:59:08.380
no problem too.

2054
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:13.510
We've been kind of posting stuff on what we're doing and also kind of um,

2055
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:15.690
you know,
amputees and stuff.

2056
01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.100
<v 3>Also since you're young and hip,
you also have your gram,</v>

2057
01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:23.340
your Instagram.
Don't forget about your Instagram.

2058
01:59:23.370 --> 01:59:26.880
Well the funny thing with that is peep.
Amanda was like,
Oh,

2059
01:59:26.881 --> 01:59:29.250
if you want get your name out there,
you need to,
Instagram comes like I'm blind.

2060
01:59:29.251 --> 01:59:32.460
I don't need to look at pictures.
But she was like,
she was like,
okay,

2061
01:59:32.461 --> 01:59:34.980
well I'll run your Instagram council when people yell at me.
And I was like,

2062
01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:36.750
how come you don't follow you on Instagram?
I was like,

2063
01:59:36.751 --> 01:59:39.540
we need to go talk to my wife on that one there.
So here's what you need to do.

2064
01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:44.340
The next 10 posts you put on Instagram,
all black,
all black and be like,

2065
01:59:44.341 --> 01:59:47.340
Hey,
what up Matt Bradford here,

2066
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:50.630
can you see what I'm talking about?
That's what I thought.

2067
01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:53.940
Look at this beautiful view of the ocean right here in California.

<v 0>Awesome man.
And uh,</v>

2099
02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:48.160
thanks to everyone that has served in is serving in our military and I started

2100
02:01:48.441 --> 02:01:53.441
off this podcast by reading the oath that you all swore to defend us.

2101
02:01:54.770 --> 02:01:59.770
So thank you all out there in our military for taking and keeping that oath.

2102
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:03.170
And obviously Matt,

2103
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:08.830
thank you so much for taking that oath per taking that oath twice for keeping

2104
02:02:10.731 --> 02:02:15.350
that oath despite everything that had been put in front of you.

2105
02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:20.450
Thank you for your service and your sacrifice and thanks for coming to talk to

2106
02:02:20.451 --> 02:02:24.560
us.
Also,
police and law enforcement and firefighters.
Paramedics,

2107
02:02:24.590 --> 02:02:26.930
EMT is correctional officer's border patrol.

2108
02:02:26.931 --> 02:02:31.931
First responders and that includes dispatchers that are staying calm on the

2109
02:02:33.851 --> 02:02:37.750
phone,
on the radio to get people the help that they need when they need it.

2110
02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:40.210
Thanks to all of you for protecting us as well.

2111
02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:44.020
We owe you all a debt of gratitude.

2112
02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:46.990
And to everyone else that's listening,

2113
02:02:46.991 --> 02:02:50.350
I'm going to take a quote from Matt Bradford's Twitter.

2114
02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:51.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2115
02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.560
<v 0>And it says this,</v>

2116
02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:57.980
to walk this earth blind is not the same as having no vision to walk by faith

2117
02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:06.590
unchanged by the hand dealt is to live life as a visionary and to love life as

2118
02:03:09.061 --> 02:03:10.560
humans were meant.

2119
02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:15.930
Seek never settle.
Inspire,

2120
02:03:16.170 --> 02:03:20.880
never complain.
Rise.
Never stay down,

2121
02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:25.560
no legs,
no vision,
no problem.

2122
02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:31.910
And let's face it,
if Matt Bradford can do what he does,

2123
02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.840
if he can keep pushing and keep driving and keep finding new missions and

2124
02:03:38.391 --> 02:03:40.640
successfully executing those missions.

2125
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:45.320
If he can wake up every day and say no legs,
no vision,

2126
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:49.670
no problem.
If he can have the vision he has,

2127
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:51.400
<v 1>yeah.</v>

2128
02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.670
<v 0>And the heart that he has
been,</v>

2129
02:03:54.671 --> 02:03:59.671
all of us can stop complaining and we can go get after it.

2130
02:04:03.130 --> 02:04:07.720
And until next time,
this is Matt and echo and Jocko

2131
02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:09.610
out.
