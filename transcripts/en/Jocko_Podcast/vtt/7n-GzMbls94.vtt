00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.210
How do I take ownership of mixed messages to the people under me from the other

2
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:10.680
leaders in my group?
Pretty straightforward question.
I like it.
Well,

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.370
first of all,

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.910
you have to address this straight up with the other leaders in your group

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.550
because if you aren't aligned as a leadership team,

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.840
this is going to hurt the cause.
It is absolutely going to hurt the cross.

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.090
This is critical and it's going to be hard.

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.100
And there are some things in your group that people do not agree on and that is

9
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:33.420
why they are undermining the messaging or why they're giving out different

10
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:35.190
messaging because they don't agree with it.

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.070
They don't have the courage to stand up and say,
Hey,

12
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.140
I don't agree with this right here,
so let's do it a different way.

13
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.630
Here's my thoughts.
They don't have the courage to do that.
So what do they do?

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.240
They just sit back and then when it comes time to put out the word,

15
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.520
they put out the mixed messages and it's,

16
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.730
it's a bad situation and you actually have to lead here.

17
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.260
That's what you have to do.

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.280
And it shouldn't actually be that hard because what you're asking for is

19
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.170
something that anybody can tell is important.
So you know,
you say this,

20
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.660
do you say to your leadership team,
you go,
hey guys,

21
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.980
our message to the troops needs to be aligned and right now it isn't.

22
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.120
We need to fix that.

23
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.060
Is there anyone on your leadership team's going to disagree with that?
No,

24
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:14.520
they won't.
That's not what they disagree with.
They,

25
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:18.030
everybody knows that the leadership team has to have an aligned message.

26
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.340
They have to be on the same sheet of music.

27
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
And that's what you need to do.
And,
and again,

28
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:26.880
it's going to be a hard conversation.

29
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.370
It's going to bring out that statement should bring out the conversation of what

30
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:35.910
people don't agree on and why they're sending miss messages.
Now

31
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.510
if you,
if you cannot get them aligned,

32
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.420
it is a serious problem.
But if you can't,

33
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:48.600
the best thing you can do is mitigate.

34
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.720
Mitigate that to your team by becoming the trusted voice.

35
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
So,
so with your team,
you want to become the trusted voice.
Now,

36
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.550
this doesn't mean that going gonna go on undermine your other leaders.
It's a,

37
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:05.870
I'll echo came in here.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,

38
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.100
no.
That's not what I'm talking about.

39
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:12.101
I'm never almost never talking about undermining another leader or a leadership

40
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.700
team.
What I'm going to do though is I'm going to translate,
I'm gonna say,

41
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.220
Hey guys,
our job on this,
I Know Echo said that.
Here's our job.
Here's,

42
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.630
here's what our focus needs to be.
Here's the way this translates for us,

43
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.590
so I'm not disparaging you and I'm not even disagreeing with you.

44
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.620
I'm simply honing the message from my team.

45
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.410
Now
you still,
even even when you do that,

46
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.270
you're mitigating that as much as possible.

47
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.300
You still have to maintain the critical goal of getting your leadership team

48
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:51.701
aligned and one other little tool to help make that happen is to present their

49
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:57.070
words back to them and you said,
you know what?

50
00:02:57.071 --> 00:03:00.130
I wrote down what you said to the team this morning and I just wanted to go

51
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.990
through that with you and break it down a little bit and then go through it line

52
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.991
by line and have the hard conversations and make the tough decisions.

53
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.670
You've got to make the tough decisions

54
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.960
and also give a little.
