00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
This is Jocko podcast number 101 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.320
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.
Second.

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:16.321
Lieutenant Bernard at Wilfrid long was a smart young man who went to Birmingham

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.810
University at age of 16 back in 1912 he was commissioned in the West Yorkshire

5
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.310
Regimen in January of 1916 and Bernard or burn as his family called him,

6
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.500
served in World War One in France and he wrote this letter to his father in

7
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.940
early August of 1916 he said,

8
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.650
we've been having it awfully wet here during the last day or two and my word

9
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.400
talk about mud.
It's simply awful.
I get into mud up to my knees.

10
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I can take a sporting risk as well as any of them and shells have got no fear

11
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:05.644
for me.

12
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.850
I've seen great big burly chaps who do nothing but curse and drink and get down

13
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:15.970
and pray like a child when there is a bombardment on and they don't care who

14
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:19.210
sees them and no one dares to joke about it.

15
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.970
I've just heard it from a pal of mine from Brockton who went down to the Somme

16
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.070
when I came here and he says he's been over the lid seven times in attacks on

17
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:32.430
the bush line.
Pretty awful.
That isn't it.

18
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.630
And I marvel,
he's alive to tell the tale.

19
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.060
He wrote another letter to his mother on August 11th,
1917

20
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.600
I am off by an early train tomorrow for the rest bill.

21
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:52.570
It's behind the firing line where we shall be for a time to get to know our men,

22
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.433
et cetera.

23
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.213
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.200
<v 0>I am going up with two pals and we are all pleased.</v>

25
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.160
I shall think of you all while I'm up there and no you won't forget me.

26
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.000
We're fighting hard now and is this serious game.

27
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.010
We're all ready to lay down everything if need be and if God wills on ready

28
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.240
so goodbye and wished me luck.

29
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.380
Your loving son burn

30
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.970
and second Lieutenant Bernard Wilford long was killed in action at age 21

31
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.600
at the battle of laying mark on August 16th,

32
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.360
1917 400 men from his battalion went into action.

33
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.690
All 10 of the officers from the battalion died

34
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.610
along with 264 of the men

35
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.390
on September 11th,
1918

36
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.550
there's another young man,

37
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.850
Sergeant David Kerr at American who dropped out of Columbia University to fight

38
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:19.240
in World War One.

39
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.690
He sent a letter to his mother the day before the attack

40
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.400
on St meal in France

41
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.550
and he wrote tomorrow the first totally American drive commences and it gives me

42
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.980
inexpressible joy and pride to know that I shall be present to do my share

43
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.910
should I go under.
Therefore,

44
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I want you to know that I went without any terror of death and that my chief

45
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:57.180
worry is the grief my death will bring to those so dear to me.

46
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.800
Since having found myself and Mary,

47
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.330
there has been much to make life suite and glorious,

48
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.430
but death while distasteful is in no way terrible.

49
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.810
I feel wonderfully strong to do my share well,
and for my sake,

50
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.920
you must try to drown your sorrow in the pride and satisfaction.

51
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.130
The knowledge that I died well and so clean a cause as is ours should bring you

52
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.560
remember how proud I have always been of your superb pluck.

53
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.990
Keep Elizabeth's future in mind and don't permit my death to bow your head.

54
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.930
My personal belongings will all be sent to you.

55
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.020
You're good taste will tell you which to send to Mary.

56
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.150
May God bless and keep you dear heart and be kind to little Elizabeth and those

57
00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:59.590
others I loved so well.
David,

58
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.113
the end

59
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.300
and while the Americans actually broke through the German lines in the attack,

60
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.070
a suffered 7,000 casualties in 72 hours of fighting and 20 year old,

61
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.390
20 year old David Kerr was among the dead.

62
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.300
And
that attitude,

63
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.230
that attitude where death is not feared,

64
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.770
we can find examples of it in so many different places.

65
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.100
A great example is from the American civil war,

66
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.850
from a man by the name of Bob Lou.

67
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.370
Now after the battle at Fort Sumner in 1861 president Lincoln called on the

68
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:12.830
stage to form up militia troops to put down the rebellion

69
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.130
and Sullivan Ballou who was born in Rhode Island was one of those volunteers and

70
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:25.351
he was commissioned to major in the second Rhode Island Infantry Regiment.

71
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.860
He was third in command

72
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.410
and the second Rhode Island infantry regimen

73
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.630
move to Washington.

74
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.920
<v 0>And joined the Union army of North Eastern Virginia.</v>

76
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.720
And on the 14th of July,
1861 from Washington

77
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.430
Sullivan wrote his wife a letter and here are some excerpts from that letter.

78
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.590
<v 0>My very dear Sarah,</v>

80
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.590
the indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days.

81
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:08.400
Perhaps tomorrow,
lest I should not be able to write you again.

82
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.640
I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no

83
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:18.470
more.
Our movement may be one of a few days,

84
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.840
duration and full of pleasure,

85
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.550
and it may be one of severe conflict at death to me.

86
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.710
<v 1>Okay?</v>

87
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.100
<v 0>Not My will,
but vine.
Oh God.
Be Done.</v>

88
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.980
If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield from my country.

89
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:37.814
I am ready.

90
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.800
<v 0>I have no misgivings about or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am</v>

92
00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:47.580
engaged and my courage does not halt or falter.

93
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.143
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.420
<v 0>I know how strongly American civilization now leans upon the triumph of the</v>

95
00:07:54.421 --> 00:07:59.160
government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the

96
00:07:59.161 --> 00:08:03.910
blood and suffering of the revolution.
And I am willing,

97
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.300
perfectly willing to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this

98
00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:12.670
government and to pay that debt.

99
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.910
But my dear wife,

100
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.250
when I know that with my own joys,

101
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.490
I laid down nearly all of yours and replaced them in this life with cares and

102
00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:30.480
sorrows.

103
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.730
When after having eaten for long years,

104
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:37.460
the bitter fruit of orphanage myself,

105
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.110
I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children.

106
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.230
Is it weak or dishonorable?

107
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.250
While the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze that my

108
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:50.720
unbounded love for you,

109
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:55.830
my darling wife and children should struggle in fierce though useless contest

110
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.330
with my love of country.

111
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.180
I cannot describe to you my feelings on this calm summer night when 2000 men are

112
00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:07.810
sleeping around me.

113
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.510
Many of them enjoying their last perhaps before that of death.

114
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.930
And I suspicious that death is creeping behind me with his fatal dart and

115
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:25.860
communing with God.
My country in you,

116
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.111
Sarah.

117
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:34.111
My love for you is deaf was it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that

118
00:09:34.151 --> 00:09:36.640
nothing but the omnipotence could break.

119
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:38.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

120
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.733
<v 0>And yet</v>

121
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.320
my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on

122
00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:49.180
with these chains to the battlefield.

123
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.040
<v 0>The memories of blissful moments I've spent with you come creeping over me and I</v>

125
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.480
feel most gratified to God and to you that I've enjoyed them so long.

126
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.980
<v 0>And hard.
It is for me to give them up and burned to ashes.</v>

128
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.400
The hopes of future years when God willing,

129
00:10:12.401 --> 00:10:17.401
we might still have lived in love together and seen or sons grow up honorable to

130
00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:20.300
manhood around us.

131
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.350
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

132
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.430
<v 0>I have,
I know,
but few small claims upon divine providence,</v>

133
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.540
but something whispers to me.
Perhaps it is wafted.

134
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.480
Perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar.

135
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:34.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

136
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.270
<v 0>That I shall return to my loved ones on harmed</v>

137
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.530
if I do not my dear Sara,

138
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.410
never forget how much I love you and when my last breath escapes me on the

139
00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:50.320
battlefield,
it will whisper your name.

140
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.873
<v 1>Okay.</v>

141
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.680
<v 0>Forgive my many faults in the many pains I've caused you.</v>

142
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.790
<v 0>How faultless and foolish I've oftentimes been.</v>

144
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.960
How gladly would I wash out with my tears?

145
00:11:07.961 --> 00:11:12.961
Every little spot upon your happiness and struggle with all the misfortune of

146
00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:16.660
this world to shield you and my children from harm.

147
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.970
But I cannot.

148
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:28.220
I must have watched you from the spirit land and hover near you while you buffet

149
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.240
the storms with your precious little freight and wait with sad patients till we

150
00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:36.640
meet to park.
No more,

151
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.920
but oh,
Sarah,

152
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:47.050
if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they love,

153
00:11:47.051 --> 00:11:48.550
I shall always be near you

154
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.000
and the garish day and in the darkest night,

155
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.850
your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours.
Always,
always.

156
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:04.840
And if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek,
hit Shelby,

157
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.690
my breath.

158
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:07.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

159
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.270
<v 0>Or if cool air fans,
you're throbbing temple.</v>

160
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.870
<v 0>It shall be my spirit passing by</v>

162
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.030
Sarah.
Do not mourn me dead.
Think I am gone and wait for the

163
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.440
<v 1>yeah,</v>

164
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.760
<v 0>for we shall meet again.</v>

165
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.500
As for my little boys,

166
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.710
they will grow as I have done and never know a father's love and care.

167
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.480
<v 0>Little Willy is too young to remember me long and my blue eyed Edgar will keep</v>

169
00:12:41.521 --> 00:12:45.630
my frolics with him amongst the dimmest memories of his childhood.

170
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.210
<v 0>Sarah,</v>

172
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.110
I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their

173
00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:57.010
characters.
I call God's blessing upon them.

174
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

175
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.040
<v 0>Oh Sarah,
I wait for you there.</v>

176
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.530
Come to me
and lead thither my children

177
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.133
Sullivan.

178
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.143
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.190
<v 0>And Dawn,
July 21st,</v>

180
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.310
1861 the regiment took part in the first battle of bull run

181
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.940
and as one of the senior officers,

182
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:32.510
Sullivan went in front on horseback to direct his man and he was hit by a cannon

183
00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:36.930
ball that tore off his right leg and also killed his horse

184
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.780
when he died from his wound a week after the battle,

185
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.700
while the prisoner of the confederate army at age 32

186
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.673
again,

187
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.790
an individual obviously prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice

188
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.250
and we know that the enemy,

189
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.233
<v 1>yeah,</v>

190
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.390
<v 0>can be equally prepared to die.</v>

191
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.860
And we saw that clearly from the kamikaze pilots from Japan in World War II.

192
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.440
One of those
young kamikaze pilots

193
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.610
was named Yukio are our rocky

194
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.390
and he was a member of the 72nd Shin Bu Squadron.

195
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.220
And he wrote this letter,
dear father and mother,

196
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.900
I trust you and my brothers are doing well.
Recently.

197
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.130
It has been that I will go

198
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.290
<v 1>at last to take part in the battle of Okinawa as a member of the special attack</v>

199
00:14:57.291 --> 00:14:59.590
forces.
Yeah,

200
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.020
<v 0>I am deeply moved.</v>

201
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.370
I only look forward to sinking a ship with a single blow.

202
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.091
<v 0>When I look back,</v>

204
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:12.830
I apologize for not being devoted to you in any way for some 10 years to this

205
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:13.664
day

206
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.130
through teaching by various senior officers.
After I entered the army,

207
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.990
I now devote myself to my country as a special attack force member.

208
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.560
Please find pleasure in your desire for my loyalty to the emperor and devotion

209
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:35.340
to parents.
I have no regrets.

210
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.940
I just go forward on my path.

211
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

212
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:46.130
<v 0>I ask that you teach my three brothers so they can serve our country as noble</v>

213
00:15:47.431 --> 00:15:48.264
airman.

214
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.400
I sincerely hope you take good care of yourselves and make strain years efforts

215
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.360
on the home front.

216
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.170
Please give my regards to all my relatives and to everyone in the neighborhood

217
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:03.010
association.

218
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:10.710
Sianora Yukio are rocky,

219
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:20.210
and he did indeed die at the age of 17 in a suicide tack on American ships near

220
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.000
Okinawa on May 27th,

221
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
1945 and the Japanese also imposed their willingness to die

222
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.230
on their people.
And here is a

223
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.090
<v 1>okay</v>

224
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:45.090
<v 0>description of that brutal imposition from American sailors,</v>

225
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:51.280
from the Journal of an American sailor named James [inaudible],

226
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.660
who served on the USS Montpelier in the Pacific.

227
00:16:55.661 --> 00:17:00.520
And this is what he wrote on November 10th,
1943 this afternoon,

228
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.990
we came across a raft with four live Japs in it.

229
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

230
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.010
<v 0>As the destroyer,
Spence came close to the raft.</v>

231
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.890
The Japs opened up with machine gun at the destroyer.

232
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.360
The jap officer then put the gun in each man's mouth had fired billowing out the

233
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:21.380
back of each man skull.

234
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:23.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

235
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.930
<v 0>One of the Japs did not want to die for the emperor and put up a struggle.</v>

236
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.040
The others held him down.

237
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.100
The officer was the last to die.

238
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.210
He also blew his brains out.

239
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:48.020
The Spence went into investigate all the bodies that disappeared into the water.

240
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.100
There was nothing left but blood at an empty raft.

241
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:54.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.490
<v 0>Swarms of sharks everywhere.</v>

243
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.430
The sharks ate well today
we went to battle stations

244
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.660
and at 10:00 PM we were attacked by enemy planes.

245
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

246
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.970
<v 0>Later darkness descended</v>

247
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:15.910
and the rains came.

248
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:22.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

249
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.750
<v 0>And just coming off the episode that we did</v>

250
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.060
with Musashi,
who obviously overcame his fear of death.

251
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.640
And I got a book

252
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.670
<v 1>in the mail from Japan</v>

253
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.930
<v 0>and the book was called the hundred rules of war.</v>

254
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.970
It's from someone in Japan named Eric Eric Shanahan,

255
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.710
who turned out to be the actual translator of this book.

256
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:02.030
And he's translated a bunch of other Japanese books on martial arts.

257
00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:06.560
And he asked me if this book,
the hundred rules of war,

258
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.540
if any of the rules inside this book apply to modern warfare.

259
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.920
And I read through the book and I read the book and it came to a very clear

260
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:21.660
answer that yes,

261
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.570
not only do many of the rules and the book apply to modern warfare,

262
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:32.040
they also apply to life in general.
Like many of the rules that I talk about

263
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.890
and this book,

264
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.620
the 100 rules of war,
which by the way only has 97 rules in it.

265
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.330
But the book was originally written by Suca Hora [inaudible] who lived from

266
00:19:52.071 --> 00:19:57.071
1,489 to 1571 then that's actually before Musashi's lifetime cause Musashi was

267
00:19:58.671 --> 00:20:02.240
born,
they say in 1584.
So this,

268
00:20:02.241 --> 00:20:05.960
this book predates Musashi and there's,

269
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.980
there's actually multiple revisions on this book.
It's interesting.

270
00:20:09.981 --> 00:20:12.650
People would get it and add something to it.

271
00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:17.651
Over the years there was a foreword written to the book in the mid 16 hundreds

272
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.820
by Tequan Soho.

273
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.840
And then there was an afterword written by one of the grandchildren of Boca den

274
00:20:26.811 --> 00:20:31.460
students.
And there's another section,

275
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:36.610
the first eight lines in the book that were added and those are attributed to

276
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.530
Shogun Yoshi Moon.

277
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.941
And he's a shogun.

278
00:20:43.941 --> 00:20:48.430
That rule did Japan from 1716 until 45.

279
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.050
So this book is very interesting and um,

280
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.250
since Eric who sent it to me is obviously fluent Japanese.

281
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:03.550
All apologize,
of course for my bad Japanese pronunciation.

282
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.560
But
we'll go for it.
We're not,

283
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:13.570
I'll want to take you through some of the sections of this book that again,

284
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.030
I feel not only applied to combat today,
but to

285
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:25.480
life today.
And interestingly,
here's the,

286
00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.910
we'll start off a little bit with the introduction and this is again written by

287
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.850
w written after the original book came out and this guy added this introduction

288
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:40.630
to it and he's describing how great the book is.

289
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.340
It's a little bit of arrogance in this,

290
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:45.580
but it's okay cause he's saying he's not saying he wrote it,
he's saying,
look,

291
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:50.581
this book is important and here we go to the book.

292
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.820
If you change out the people,
if you change out the words,

293
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:58.600
if you change out the places and if you change out every generation,

294
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:04.470
it is like the difference between rain do snow and ice,

295
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.030
the reach a formed by the same water.
That's interesting,
right?

296
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.480
Because now we're talking about people that you can be different times,

297
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:16.090
different places,
different,
different surroundings,

298
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.870
but it's like the difference between rain and doing snow and ice.

299
00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:23.170
It's the same water.
The same people are the same.

300
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.211
Back to the book.

301
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:29.860
These words should be read by any and everyone who follows the way of the

302
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:30.694
warrior.

303
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.410
Speak them aloud so that you may hear them in your ears and failed to heed them

304
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:36.310
at your peril.

305
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.660
They're not simply words to revere and praise.

306
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.940
If you are attempting to equate the teachings within this scroll to any other

307
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:46.870
work,
no,

308
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:50.530
that this is knowledge that can be found only after somebody in the tallest peak

309
00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:51.364
of a mountain.

310
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.530
The depth of the wisdom contained down these pages makes the sea seems shallow

311
00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:57.550
by comparison.

312
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.380
If you were to compare a person versed in these ideas to a stone,

313
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.040
you would find the ladder soft by comparison.

314
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.240
Pull a bow string,
launching an era or pulling a bowstring,
launching an Arrow,

315
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.630
raising your whip,
encouraging your steed,
dawn in your armor,

316
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.010
taking up your lance,

317
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.940
gaining fame and honor and becoming one who starts a great house.

318
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.430
Read this book,
listen to it.

319
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.120
Understand the unmistakable truths.

320
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:33.310
It would be utterly foolish to not lock them in your mind,

321
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.560
in my opinion.

322
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.940
Even if you lived through a hundred generations over a thousand years,

323
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:45.390
coming across another book like this would be like to a blind turtle who comes

324
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:52.541
to the surface once every hundred years climbing its way into a hole on a piece

325
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:56.660
of driftwood.
I liked that.

326
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.170
Now as we jump into this book,
there's one more thing I need to match.

327
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:04.820
I said that there's these additions Kinda to the book over time.
Well,

328
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:06.620
one of the additions to the book,

329
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.130
I mean this book was written in the 15 hundreds but one of the additions to the

330
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:11.450
book,
and this is something that,

331
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.020
that Eric added that he found a translation of the book by a researcher and a

332
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:25.880
practitioner of the sword arts.
And this guy's name was Horry show.

333
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:30.881
He and he produced the tax and he put little helpful interpretations,

334
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:33.620
kind of furthering the idea a little bit.

335
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.980
So I'll read those sometimes because it gives a little bit of clarification as

336
00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:40.610
to what's being talked about.

337
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.520
And these first eight lines are,
actually,
I'll,

338
00:24:45.521 --> 00:24:50.210
I'll give it up for these first eight lines of his book being fairly epic,

339
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.580
fairly epic.
And again,

340
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:56.570
these were written by Tokugawa Shogun.

341
00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.510
You Shoe Mooney,
and again,

342
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:04.511
he was the shogun ruler of Japan from 1716 to 1745 and here's what he added to

343
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:10.970
the book.
And I think these are,
well,
here's number one.

344
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.300
You cannot have pleasure without pain and you cannot have pain without pleasure.

345
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.960
Your struggles now will be rewarded in the future.
So you must endure,

346
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.180
right?
Yes.
Kind of speaks for itself.
Does it not?

347
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.430
In fact,
I think we call that discipline equals freedom.
Yup.

348
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.180
Next be reverent towards the law.

349
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.690
Be Afraid of fire.
Be Afraid of thoughtless,

350
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.490
delusional people and never forget to be reverent to those you owe a debt of

351
00:25:50.491 --> 00:25:54.950
gratitude to.
This is one of those things that,

352
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.730
what do we say now?
Never forget where you came from.
Right?
People say,

353
00:25:57.731 --> 00:25:58.990
never will forget where you came from.
Well,

354
00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:02.020
don't forget those people that got you there.
Yeah.
Cause where you came from,

355
00:26:02.021 --> 00:26:06.910
somebody helped you all along the way and so don't forget about that.

356
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.043
Next one.

357
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.130
You should think of greed and lust as the enemy.
Hmm.

358
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.070
Concur.
I think I like this one.

359
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:25.960
You should neither sleep late nor talk too long.

360
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.070
Now I guess I'm kind of the talk too long.

361
00:26:30.071 --> 00:26:33.520
I may be violating that on a regular basis.
At least once a week on a podcast.

362
00:26:33.521 --> 00:26:37.420
Yes,
me too.
Sometimes.
Actually you might violate that on a regular

363
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:44.160
hastily,
but here's,
here's a guy,
don't sleep late and you know,
I get this all

364
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.640
<v 3>the,
every time I,
every time somebody talks to me about sleeping,</v>

365
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.850
someone says why I have the night shift or while I work late and my,

366
00:26:53.151 --> 00:26:57.030
my kids don't go to bed until midnight.
Okay.
I get it.
My saying,

367
00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:00.720
everyone of the world has to wake up at four 30 yeah.
What I'm saying is this,

368
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:03.960
you shouldn't sleep late.
Right.
And if you work the night shift,

369
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.710
not sleeping late might be waking up at noon.

370
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.940
You didn't oversleep is my point.
The idea,

371
00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:16.710
just like we all want to like stay cozy and our Ben and kind of take our time

372
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.190
getting up and kind of thing.
Yeah,
it's the idea for sure.

373
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.570
That's what I get from it anyway.

374
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:27.010
It's not the mandatory four 30.
And if you don't wake up at four 30,

375
00:27:27.011 --> 00:27:30.440
you're black or something like someone,
someone,
um,

376
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.250
I would picture my hands on the interweb right.
And uh,

377
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.090
I have a little callous get removed.
Sure.

378
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.850
On the pull up bar and on the pulling,
but someone,
someone,

379
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:45.960
someone said,
hey,
if,
if someone doesn't have callouses,
they don't work out.

380
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.100
And then someone else said,
well what if you run a marathon?
You still work out.

381
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.750
Exactly.
You know,
it's,
the point is get some right kids.

382
00:27:57.751 --> 00:28:00.100
Can you get some while training for a marathon?
Yes.

383
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.410
Can you get someone to run your marathon?
Yes.
You can look at Rob Jones.
You know,

384
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.610
he just ran 31 marathons in 31 days.
Yeah.
That's getting,

385
00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.730
we're not accusing him of not working his lack of palaces,

386
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:15.990
although I'm sure he has cows.
Yeah.
All right.
Next.

387
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.820
Take care to organize even trivial things.

388
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.180
Then if something major occurs,
it will not catch you off guard.

389
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.790
So that's the little things that mattered.
Attention.
He's got to go in or not.

390
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.100
And we know military.
When you joined the military,
I joke about it,

391
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:34.400
they make you fold your underwear in like a four by four inch square and that's

392
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:39.930
the thing they're trying to teach you attention to detail.
Yeah.

393
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.880
Cause actually I was talking to a marine buddy of mine,
I think it was,

394
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.740
I wanna say it was Morgan.
Yeah.
And they were,
they landed there,

395
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:54.741
Hilo and the gunner or whoever was in charge of the weapon cracked off a 50 cal

396
00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:59.100
round into the,
well,
so you have a 50 cal mountain in the,

397
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.310
in the helicopter guy cracked off around.
He if,

398
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.320
if a weapon gets hot it can just shoot.
Yeah.
Weapons really hot.

399
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:08.400
It's called a cook off.

400
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.320
You've got to Brown in the chamber and the weapons hot and it can just make that

401
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:16.860
round go off from what?
The wet anything.
This weather from hot,

402
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.190
if it's hot while you're shooting it.
Okay.
If it's on your side,
then you add,

403
00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:21.760
you shooted a bonsai and now it gets hot.

404
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:26.290
There's a hot round sitting in a chamber and a minute goes by or you don't know

405
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.810
him.
You don't know how long it's going to be.
It could be a minute,

406
00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:32.790
could be five minutes of boom,
all of a sudden it just fires and this.

407
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.480
So before in this particular case,
I'm not sure the weapon system,

408
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.330
it was a 50 caliber,
but I'm not sure where they had it mounted.
But anyways,

409
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:44.900
he should have cleared it before he folded it up into the helicopter and he

410
00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:49.990
didn't do that.
And so he pulled the,
the rounds out.

411
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:52.900
But there's one round sitting in a chamber and sure enough a cooked off.

412
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.260
So that's the kind of thing where they're trying to get you to pay attention to

413
00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:00.940
the small details,
the trivial things.
Trivial things aren't too trivial.

414
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.930
Yeah.
Did they,
do they explain that to you?
Like when,

415
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:07.810
when you're folding your underwear,
do they explain okay.
It didn't at all?

416
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.131
They do.

417
00:30:09.131 --> 00:30:14.131
And I've talked about this before on the podcast that my drill instructor in in

418
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.950
officer candidate school at the end of officer candidate school,

419
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:22.920
he explained why on everything at the end,
at the end,
this to me,
I'll be like,

420
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.920
no.
While you're doing it though,
they'll,
they'll be saying,
how can you,

421
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.750
you can't even fold your underwear.
Not Right.

422
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:31.960
How can we trust you with a weapon system?
They'll say that kind of thing to you,

423
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.700
but you don't really,
when you're,
well,

424
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:37.240
when I was going through regular bootcamp where you're just trans,
your,

425
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.380
your mind is being transformed from civilian world to military world.

426
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.900
So you're not,
you don't have good perspective.

427
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.240
You're like weapons system,
man.
I just want to the next meal.

428
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.600
You're not,
you can't see the big picture.
I mean,
I,
I couldn't,

429
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.620
I was too young or too dumb or a little bit of both.
But they do.
They're saying,

430
00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:59.580
hey,
how could you,
how could you go?
Could you trust?

431
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.390
How could you fly an airplane if you can't even fold your underwear?
Right?

432
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.030
Boy,
you're actually thinking,
well damn,

433
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:10.210
maybe I shouldn't be flying and if it's late I fucking can't pull my underwear.

434
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.043
Right?

435
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.640
But they're trying to teach you attention to detail and it is good and it does

436
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:17.590
apply to everything.
You know,

437
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:20.500
it does apply to everything and you do the little things right.

438
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:24.130
And that way the little things are in order and that means the big things.

439
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.880
Even if they catch a little off guard,
you're at least prepared for him.
Yeah,

440
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.220
yeah.
That,
that whole thing that,
I mean I dig it.

441
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.550
You know how they're talking to you guys like that,
but that whole thing where,

442
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.330
how do you expect to do this when you can't even tie your shoes right or

443
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:42.160
whatever you know,
like,
or you don't bind to that.
I do actually.

444
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.760
No,
it's good.
You're like,
how are you going to cause a lot of things.

445
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:48.160
It's like a false little equivalency.
There some,

446
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.120
some things there's telling you to pay attention to a little thing called

447
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.440
attention to detail.
I get that part of it for sure,

448
00:31:53.441 --> 00:31:57.670
but I'm saying like say if they are not explaining why and it could be wrong.

449
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.740
Well they're explaining why,
but they're doing it.
They're not doing it.

450
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.500
They're not breaking it down like a school teacher as well.
This is Echo Charles.

451
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:10.390
Let me tell you why this.
No,
they're not.

452
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:11.410
They're not.
They're saying,
hey,

453
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.810
how can we trust you with a rifle if you can't fall joinder where,
right.
Yeah.

454
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.230
Okay.
And,
and,
and,
and I would say this,
maybe I didn't see the big picture,

455
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:22.000
but I at least saw the little picture.
Well,
yeah,

456
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:24.850
well that's the thing ultimately like,
um,
you know,
like,

457
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:27.760
and I mentioned misdemeanor,
like on Cra Credit Kitten,
right?
Where he's like,

458
00:32:27.761 --> 00:32:30.310
wax on,
wax off,
you know,
and he's like,
oh,
this is so dumb.

459
00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:34.180
Then at the end he gets the picture,
you know,
but as he's doing it,
I mean,

460
00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:36.130
he didn't say,
you know,
if you can't send the floor,

461
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.620
how are you going to find it in the tournament?
Nothing like that.
But well,

462
00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:41.140
he was of some kind of technique allegedly.
Right.

463
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.390
That's essentially what they're doing as far as attention to detail there.

464
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:46.970
Make you do all these little dudes you did too,
that would make you,

465
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.200
there's nothing dino,
Dino.
Sure.

466
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.770
There's some sit there and foot lock pieces of wood.
Yeah.

467
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:58.100
But that's pretty it.
Like,
that's an obvious translation.
You know,

468
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:02.360
like I'm put locks,
it's like punching a punching bag.
You know?
Same thing too,

469
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.750
just to check.
All right,
going to the next one.

470
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.680
90% is not enough.

471
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.610
Only 100% we'll keep disaster at bay.

472
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.810
That's good.
Now of course,

473
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.120
many times I'll say,
hey,
80 you got an 80% solution.
Go.
Right?
Yeah.

474
00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.720
Cause people will sit around and wait for the private brand good blend now,

475
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.180
which I think that's a little bit different,
but this,

476
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.850
I think if you're talking about effort,
yeah,
right.

477
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.630
The effort has to be 100% yeah.

478
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:37.220
You're not going to give 100% and it's a settling thing too,
right.

479
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.590
Where do you know people don't like to settle,
you know?

480
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.790
Don't tell for 90% a hundred percent is required.
Exactly.
Yeah.

481
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:48.710
For it or whatever.
Yeah.
That's what I get from it.
Next.

482
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:52.940
Having good judgment also means being able to endure,

483
00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:02.940
endure,
take pain,
and it's not just pain.

484
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.680
It's also being able to take
just,
just

485
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.320
like discomfort and like how many people don't want to do a job just because

486
00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:18.060
it's,
it just cause it's grueling and not fun.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah,
right.
Hear me.

487
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.350
A lot of things fall in that category.
Not Right now currently obviously,

488
00:34:22.351 --> 00:34:24.120
but in general,
yeah.

489
00:34:24.121 --> 00:34:27.730
That's my general attitude from for the most part sometimes.

490
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.500
What was the worst most menial job that you really hated?

491
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:35.880
My worst job that I really hated was being a mover at American.

492
00:34:35.881 --> 00:34:38.730
Whoever's on a wall,
we're going away for the summer,

493
00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.750
but then you get a little bit what like like,
Hey man,

494
00:34:42.751 --> 00:34:46.830
I'm going to move this thing really fast.
No,
no,
no,
not at all.

495
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.790
It's like for other people all day,
like,

496
00:34:50.791 --> 00:34:53.990
and it was bad as like 13 hours a day average that we're constrained.

497
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.020
They talk to timeout and I work construction and the first day on the job site,

498
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:01.830
they,
the guys came into the Wendy's.
I worked at Wendy's.
Sure.

499
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.040
And the guys looked at me and the in this old Italian guy builder,

500
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:11.730
he looks at me,
he goes,
what are you doing here?
I said,
I'm making rent.
He says,

501
00:35:11.731 --> 00:35:14.220
you want to work here?
I said,
no sir.
He said,

502
00:35:14.221 --> 00:35:17.340
you want to work construction with me?
I said,
yes sir.
He said,

503
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.980
report tomorrow we're over crack.

504
00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:22.320
Because they were building a place right across the street.
Yeah.
I said,
yes sir.

505
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.840
So I showed up there in the morning and there is there a dump truck had come

506
00:35:27.841 --> 00:35:32.280
with a ton of concrete block to that.

507
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:37.020
We're going to build a little foundation wall and they just dumped it,
you know,

508
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.580
a hundred yards away.
All these concrete blocks.
Yeah.
And he says,

509
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.833
Hey,

510
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.790
your job today is to move these blocks over to get them over here near the

511
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:52.470
foundation thing.
And he said,
we're going to get some coffee and some donuts,

512
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.410
sir.
Yeah.
Donuts.
So I said,

513
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:03.090
yes sir.
And he got an a truck with the guys,
right.

514
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:07.470
And I started moving these blocks I was running.

515
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.710
I was running literally running as fast as I could possibly do it.

516
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.430
And I wasn't even doing that as like a challenge to myself.

517
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.270
I was so happy to not be working at Wendy's that I would have.

518
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.520
I mean,
I just was filled with energy so I can get all these blocks done in the,

519
00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:28.410
another guy was there who didn't go to get coffee and donuts and he kind of gave

520
00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:33.060
me,
hey man,
you need to slow down.
You're going to make everyone look bad.

521
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:38.280
And I would just say,
Hey,
I'm going pretty slow.
And I said,
I said,
don't worry,

522
00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:41.550
I'll do whatever you,
I'll do your job.
You can sit there.
I don't care.

523
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.870
But what do you do any of that?
You didn't get any,

524
00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:49.650
I mean you didn't propose a little challenges to yourself and your little work

525
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:54.120
crew.
That's actually how I got by.
It was like,
okay,
let me do this.

526
00:36:54.121 --> 00:36:55.830
Because if there's a way to get by,

527
00:36:55.831 --> 00:36:59.280
you should tell people because some people are stuck in jobs that they don't

528
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:00.630
like right at this moment in time.

529
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:03.430
They're listening to podcasts and they're working at Wendy's.
Yeah,

530
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.310
and I worked at Wendy's,
Bro.

531
00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.060
They get off on foot locker,
douchy view there.

532
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:15.600
Worked at foot locker,
but shoes guy in the back,

533
00:37:15.601 --> 00:37:20.460
stock crew shoes and stuff like that.
He was funny,
man on quiet.

534
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:22.930
Working at footlocker was kind of when you'd lock in and be like,
hey,

535
00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:25.320
and that's kind of cool.
You get to where the ref uniform and all that.

536
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.070
And that's what men,
when we were in high school,
so we started working.

537
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:33.600
I was like,
this is,
it's tedious.
It's weird how your perspective changes.

538
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.350
I was thinking about that the other day when you're a young team guy and you
get,

539
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:41.330
like when I got my first apartment I was,
I might as well man doll.

540
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.040
I was the richest guy in the world,
you know?
It was like I was the man.

541
00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.790
Yeah.
But then as you,
you know,
you settle into that.

542
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:54.750
Then you say,
well,
you know what?
I need to be cool to have a little house.

543
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.190
You gotta be be weary of the greed.
That's true.
That's true.

544
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.260
But that's natural though,
right?
It's like a,
you don't,

545
00:38:01.261 --> 00:38:03.960
when you get used to something,
it becomes the new standard.

546
00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:05.620
You know how that whole thing works.
Right.

547
00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.190
Well okay then what's the difference between someone,

548
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:10.260
cause you and I both know people,
we all know people.

549
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.630
There's people that get to the comfort zone and then they're done.

550
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.630
What's the difference between someone that gets the comfort zone and done and

551
00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:17.250
someone that gets the comfort zone and says all right,

552
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:21.000
I'm comfortable here but I want more.
I want to do more.
Maybe not want more.

553
00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:25.740
Cause that implies a materialistic point but I just want more.
Huh?

554
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:26.963
Yeah,
I know.
Huh?

555
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.650
Cause they're both like really like obviously prevalent and like almost

556
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:36.100
naturally you can get both of those personalities exists.
I'm sure we're all like

557
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.450
<v 4>board both of that.</v>

558
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.360
I'm sure everybody is both of those things in one way or another.

559
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:45.070
You know like in Oh yeah.
We're probably both in the comfort zone.

560
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.450
Big Time as far as certain things,
you know,
I don't know why.
You know I can't

561
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:51.870
<v 0>because if you think about it,</v>

562
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.850
you see someone that's got 70% body fat.
Yeah.

563
00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.890
And you go,
dude,
yeah,

564
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.840
that dude's got 70% body fat that's got like that socks.
Like yeah,

565
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.940
that person should work.
You know,
try and get that,

566
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.020
try and drop that percentage down.
Yeah.
But there's someone that's looking at me,

567
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:15.750
some guy that's obsessed with being lean as hell.
He's looking at me like,

568
00:39:15.751 --> 00:39:19.180
God,
I can't believe Jockos got whatever.
Yeah,

569
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:23.610
20% or 18 whenever my percent body fat is.
Yeah,

570
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.130
he's looking at me going,
dude.

571
00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:30.510
<v 4>Well you know what I mean?
So my,
my comfort zone.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.</v>

572
00:39:30.511 --> 00:39:34.950
Because it's not like you were getting after looking after your body percent

573
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.730
levels and then you hit a certain number and then you were like,
Eh,

574
00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:41.550
who cares kind of thing.
I don't think that that's the way it went.

575
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.970
Here's what happened.
Not with you.
Obviously I can't speak,
you know,

576
00:39:44.971 --> 00:39:49.140
as far as your comfort zones go.
But a typical one will say is that,

577
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:50.910
you know,

578
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.560
guys will be working out and like getting their fresh hair cut or whatever and

579
00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:59.100
then they'll get married and then they won't work out as much.
Being guys,
girls,

580
00:39:59.101 --> 00:40:00.990
whatever,
um,
you know,
and do that.

581
00:40:00.991 --> 00:40:04.200
They quote unquote let themselves go after they get married like Deca and stuff.

582
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:08.100
But they might focus a lot more on their career and then they might want more of

583
00:40:08.101 --> 00:40:11.520
that.
But then the,
you know,
it's like that kind of stuff.
Yeah.

584
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.740
I the year watch out for the comfort zone.
Yeah.

585
00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.130
All right.

586
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:18.980
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

587
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.800
<v 0>next.
Oh,</v>

588
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.980
now we've moved beyond those opening lines and now we get into the bulk of the

589
00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:28.250
book book,
which again,
which is written by this book,
Den Guy.

590
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.800
And here we go.
It does not matter whether you are filing,

591
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.910
firing at an enemy near you or an opponent,
some distance away,

592
00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.880
you should be adept at selecting the best arrowhead.

593
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.140
And then the,
the amplification on that says,

594
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:50.680
the lesson here is that you need a strong Arrow for an adversary at close range,

595
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:54.730
but a lighter one for hating an opponent far away.
And I guess when I read this,

596
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.470
the point that I got out of it was you,

597
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.470
you need to be able to select your tools properly,
right?
And,
and as a leader,

598
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.640
you need to be able to select.

599
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.710
Think of all the tools we've talked about on this podcast that you need to use

600
00:41:08.711 --> 00:41:11.860
as a leader.
Some guy just got gotta be a little bit harsher with a guy.

601
00:41:11.861 --> 00:41:14.710
Sometimes you get a big,
you get a flanker guy.
Sometimes you gotta be directors.

602
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:17.200
All these different tools that you need to use as a leader.

603
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.920
You ganna be adept at selecting the right tools.

604
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.400
And I gave a metaphor on here one time about,

605
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.830
about how,
uh,
you like a woodworker,

606
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.680
right?
This is actually what's interesting about the word metaphor

607
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.190
<v 4>is as a leader,
you have to be like a woodworker,</v>

608
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.120
which means you need to learn all these different types of tools,

609
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:42.500
but you need to learn how to use these different tools on different types of

610
00:41:42.501 --> 00:41:46.580
wood.
And each one of these types of wood,

611
00:41:46.581 --> 00:41:49.040
each one of these individual pieces of wood is a little bit different.

612
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:52.190
They got a little not,
they get a grain,
they get things.
So you,

613
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.170
you can't just learn the mechanical skill.

614
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.610
You have to learn to be a true craftsman with the tools and then you have to

615
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:01.460
learn about what the different types of people they are and then you have to see

616
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:03.890
that each,
even a different type.
Like this person might have a big ego,

617
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:07.040
but they got this other thing and you will not,
they get a little different grain

618
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.340
like a barber,
you know,

619
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:14.330
of our concerns versus using the clippers slow yet and he busts out the thing

620
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:16.280
and it depends,
you know?
That's true.

621
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.460
Like a barber or I guess we could say any type of craftsmen that's to work with

622
00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:23.480
varying medium.
Sure.
Yeah.
Pretty much anybody really.

623
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.620
Everybody you watched the social network brought,
watch that show.

624
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:31.360
It sounds weird.
It's like when you first hear the ideas about Facebook,

625
00:42:31.361 --> 00:42:35.750
you will have of off Facebook and Zuckerberg.
The first,
when you hear about that,

626
00:42:35.751 --> 00:42:40.120
you're like,
Oh,
who cares?
But Bro,
that's a good movie.
Really good movie.
Anyway,

627
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.460
it's a movie.
I thought it was a,
is it a show or a movie?
A movie.

628
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:48.770
The social network.
Is he awkward?
Yeah.
Yeah,
it she'll,
it's really,

629
00:42:48.771 --> 00:42:53.210
they overdo his awkwardness.
You think?
Maybe?
Maybe.
Yeah,
maybe.
I Dunno.

630
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:57.020
I don't really follow soccer Berg to know his awkwardness or whatever.

631
00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.540
But you ever heard people call them Zucks?
Yeah,
it's up.

632
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:04.170
Cause I like wearing tight.
We're tight.

633
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.710
CSEC sucks.
But he,
he's,
he's,
he's doing something.
He's,

634
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:13.370
he's breaking into the college computer or main frame,

635
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.640
whatever he's breaking into and he's kind of narrating what he's doing.

636
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:19.340
He's like,
I had to do this so I had to break out this,
this,
you know,
and he's,

637
00:43:19.341 --> 00:43:22.430
he's doing the same thing.
That was a really revealing part in regards,

638
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:24.810
he's doing the same thing.
Oh he's got a mic.

639
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:28.310
So he's trying to solve these freight.
It's all code and you know,

640
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.680
so he's trying to solve this problem,

641
00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:34.370
but then this problem comes up and then this one has these specific problems.

642
00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:35.151
So he has to solve them,

643
00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:37.940
but he can't just do it with the current tools he has to bus out to the tuition.

644
00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:40.550
When he was creating it of,
of what it was going to be.

645
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.610
Well did he feel that confident about it?
Does he see?

646
00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:46.790
Did he see the whole vision or did he like wake up one day and say,
Dang,

647
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:49.550
this thing isn't going to be really,
it was like,

648
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:53.270
it was a slow evolution into it because at first it was like he started with

649
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:54.920
this thing called face smash,

650
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:59.750
which was basically just comparing the girls on campus,

651
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:02.660
like who's hotter?
Hmm.
And then you click okay,

652
00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:05.180
she thought it and then you go to the next one.
She thought her anything,

653
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.670
you know,
and that's cold blooded sex and that was a big part of it.

654
00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:11.720
It was like that's what people would hate him and stuff like that.

655
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:15.650
And then it just slowly,
um,
no,
I was a social network.

656
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:20.420
These guys like,
isn't that what a teenager would do?
Right.
Oh yeah.

657
00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:20.870
Big Time.

658
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:23.690
And that's what they were trying to emphasize to more like he just wanted it to

659
00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:25.990
be liked by people or he made that,

660
00:44:25.991 --> 00:44:29.940
I thought that was going to help them be liked.
I don't know.

661
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.640
This is just what the moves are.
I Dunno.
You know,

662
00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:36.050
I'm sure there's some inconsistencies with it,
but where does,

663
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.690
it would be weird to meet him.
Well,
not just to meet him like,
Hey,

664
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.180
nice to meet you,
but to actually know him,
I guess.

665
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.370
Because then you see what someone's,
there's been,

666
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.170
there's been people that I've kind of known that were,
uh,
whatever soda,

667
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:52.730
semi famous or,
or whatever the word is.
Sure.
And,
and in Riyadh,

668
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.320
like on TV,
they seem like they're not cool people,

669
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.770
but in regular life they're really cool.
And then the opposite.

670
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:03.830
I've also seen where someone is seems super cool when you see their persona and

671
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:08.150
then real life,
they're not cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.

672
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:12.420
I guess that'd be pretty common to kind of be inconsistent in that way or have

673
00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:15.150
it be inconsistent as far as your experience with that person,

674
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:19.110
it seems like it'd be kind of comment,
right?
Because a lot of people,

675
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.330
if they're famous or if they're,
you know,
famous,
popular,
whatever you,

676
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.630
a lot of times you kinda got to turn it on for the camera.
Right.

677
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.690
Especially because you're essentially a performer in one way or another,

678
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.460
whether it be actor or whoever,
you know,
even like businessmen,

679
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:39.090
you know,
like it's weird and it's not even necessarily a bad thing.

680
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:42.360
It's more like for lack of better term,
a required thing,
you know?

681
00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:45.840
So like my brother for example,
like if I know him,

682
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:47.730
but then when I hear him talking to like,

683
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.470
like I dunno executives or something or like,
um,
every once in a while he'll,

684
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:57.330
I'll see you on an like an interview or something and I'm like,
like he only,

685
00:45:57.331 --> 00:45:59.260
cause I know,
I know.
So good.

686
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.730
I just thought of Joe Rogan.
Yeah.

687
00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:08.731
So I actually met Joe Rogan a long time ago when I was just dean want a dean's

688
00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:13.750
cornerman right.
You know,
you know how Joe Rogan treated me back then?
Huh.

689
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.530
Super Cool.
Like,
like this school,
just the same.

690
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:20.350
I then when I was up on his podcast,
the same dude that,

691
00:46:20.351 --> 00:46:22.980
that's a good dude right there.
You know what I mean?
To agree.

692
00:46:22.981 --> 00:46:27.030
And strangely enough,
I had the exact same experience and this,
and this will,

693
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:31.530
this will kind of demonstrate how legitimate it is.
Right?
So same exact story.

694
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:34.860
I met Joe Rogan for the first time with Dean and my wife.
We went to,

695
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.440
we kind of knew red band through,
it's a long story.

696
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:38.730
So we went to one of his shows,

697
00:46:38.731 --> 00:46:41.880
we got to go to one of his shows and go talk to them afterwards.
Right.

698
00:46:41.881 --> 00:46:44.790
So that's the first day I met him.
Same thing.
Super Nice.
Gave me his email.

699
00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:50.530
I'm like,
right,
I'm just some dude.
Oh Charles.
He was like,
hey,
yeah,
email.
Yeah.

700
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:55.050
And then so the next time I see him was when I went to legends to train when I

701
00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:58.020
was going to La for fulfill me and until I train it legends.

702
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:03.000
And so I go there and um,
he's there,

703
00:47:03.001 --> 00:47:06.570
he's rolling with everyone and you know,
it's like he's known there or whatever,

704
00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:10.020
you know,
like a calm,
just another person there as far as training goes.
And then,

705
00:47:10.021 --> 00:47:12.420
um,
so he's kind of cruising down the side.
So it's like,
oh,

706
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:15.540
I'm going to go ask them to roll.
So I was like,
Hey,
what's up?
Yeah,

707
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:18.450
I met you with Dean long time ago,
you know,
a few years ago,
whatever it was like,

708
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.180
he was like,
yeah,
that must've been a lot.
Like he totally did it.
Remember me,

709
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.900
you know,
it's not like,
oh,
I remember you so now I'm going to be cool to you.

710
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.380
It was like he did totally did it.

711
00:47:26.381 --> 00:47:29.650
Remember me and I was probably one of many people and he was still just cool.

712
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.360
So he starts talking about UFC,
you know,

713
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:35.380
how like you did your hey small talk before you guys were home and then,
um,

714
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.770
so it's small talking starts talking about current UFC stuff.

715
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.340
We didn't even enroll who,
I just want to listen to him talk about USC.

716
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.600
And so he didn't roll,
but same thing,
same exact thing.
And then,

717
00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:51.000
and even when I went up to film with him for the metamorph stuff ready,

718
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.070
but all this stuff,
same thing he liked,
forgot about me again.

719
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:56.410
That was like years ago and he was like,
Oh yeah,

720
00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:58.690
that must've been a long time ago.
Same exact thing.
I was like,
yeah,

721
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.550
I actually respect the fact that,
does it go?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
I remember.
Yeah,
yeah,

722
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:06.150
fully.
Yeah.
He's,
he's doesn't play that game.
No.

723
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:09.610
I actually met 80 million people last year and I don't really remember you,

724
00:48:09.611 --> 00:48:13.240
but it's good to hang out with you right now again.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.

725
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.490
And this,
I mean,
of course,
yeah,

726
00:48:15.491 --> 00:48:19.810
Joe Rogan is like this and if people are like this in general,
that is just,

727
00:48:19.811 --> 00:48:23.890
like I said,
that's kind of like a,
not a litmus test,
but kind of like this,

728
00:48:23.891 --> 00:48:25.390
this indicator,
you know,

729
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:30.210
he didn't remember me so really since he didn't remember me for all intensive

730
00:48:30.211 --> 00:48:32.080
purposes,
I was just another person

731
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.180
and same exact treatment,
just cool.
Just normal.

732
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:43.090
It wasn't like,
I mean,
you're you and there's this separation kind of thing.

733
00:48:43.091 --> 00:48:46.690
It would,
none of that.
No good way to be.

734
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:49.030
I don't even know how we ended up talking about that one.

735
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.180
You dropped Joe Rogan's the name and we started talking about it.
So,
you know,

736
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.510
<v 0>good point named job,
Dave tropper.
All right,</v>

737
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:04.480
next you're mount should be of normal strength and spirit.

738
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.960
Horses with a strong urge to win or fearful and skittish should be rejected out

739
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:11.104
of hand.

740
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:16.290
So I thought this was interesting because we're talking about finding someone

741
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:21.880
that's balanced right.
Dot.
Not someone that's,
he's a normal,

742
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.660
normal strength and spirit.
Don't want someone at Spragg row,

743
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.850
but you don't want someone that's weak.
You want someone that's in the middle.

744
00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.780
And,
uh,
the amplification on it says courses without nerve or weak,

745
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:35.290
while a horse with a lot of spirit cannot be written by normal people.

746
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:41.170
In other words,
a slightly strong,
somewhat plucky horse is best.

747
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:44.320
Plucky by the way,
second time we've heard that word today,

748
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.980
this is a sign to learn the word.
Do you know what it means?
I didn't know him.
No,

749
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:52.120
no,
he's brave.
Plucky mean means brave.
Okay.

750
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.490
Does indeed had to look that one up?

751
00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:00.400
Similar here.
As long as the horse is strong,
is it acceptable?

752
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:04.090
It is acceptable for it to have a certain inclination.
However,

753
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:08.140
never ride a horse with a tendency to retreat.
So if you've got a strong horse,

754
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:13.870
it's basically,
to me,
this is as long as the thing is not going to turn tail,

755
00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.440
if it's a little bit feisty,
if it's a little bit of this,
a little bit of that,

756
00:50:17.441 --> 00:50:19.570
you can have a little bit different personnel.
And what I,

757
00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.120
what I took away from this is as a leader,
once again,

758
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.120
you're going to get people with some things going on.

759
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:27.590
It's a little personality traits.
Some little,

760
00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:28.910
like when you're putting together a seal platoon,

761
00:50:28.911 --> 00:50:32.510
you're gonna have some guys that are got some idiosyncrasies,
right?
Yeah.

762
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:37.600
You got 16 guys and a seal platoon.
You got 36 guys in a task unit.

763
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.580
They're not all the same by any stretch.

764
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.180
And some of them are going to be even further outside the box of,
you know,

765
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:47.690
they're gonna have,
they're going to have some kind of idiosyncrasy,

766
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:51.440
we might even call it an issue for me,
like that's kind of an overused word,

767
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:54.680
but I mean if they're going to issue,
right?
Sure.
Okay.

768
00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:00.070
What this is saying is,
as long as they're not going to retreat and run where,

769
00:51:00.071 --> 00:51:02.210
all right.
But if they're going to retreat and run,

770
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:07.350
if that's their idiosyncrasy Ghana,
yeah,
get rid of him.
What do you call it?

771
00:51:07.351 --> 00:51:11.730
A deal breaker.
It's a deal breaker.
Deal breaker.
Deal breaker.
Big Time.
All right.

772
00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:12.700
The next,

773
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.330
while small horses may be easier to handle as well as dismount from those who

774
00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:20.130
prefer such animals are,
are a bit dim.

775
00:51:20.131 --> 00:51:25.131
Witted so what I like about this is if you're in a leadership position,

776
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.320
you might want our surround yourself with people that are just that.

777
00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:30.950
They'll just do what you say in there.
You see what I'm saying?

778
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.610
I want my horses all just to fall in line and they're easy to get on and off.

779
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:36.530
And if I yell at them,
they don't vet.
Don't bark back.

780
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.150
You don't want those people.

781
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:42.140
You want people that are a little bit harder to handle,

782
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:45.560
just a little bit harder to handle.
Maybe they're gonna stand up to you.

783
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.480
Like I always say,
you don't wanna be surrounded by yes men.

784
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.090
You want to be surrounded by people that will question you and say,

785
00:51:50.091 --> 00:51:53.510
I don't like this plan.
So that's the kind of horses you want,

786
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.970
not not little tiny weak horses.

787
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.593
Next,

788
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.960
you should know that a person wearing a newly forged sword will invariably

789
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.540
blunder even if that sword cuts well.

790
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:20.750
So basically this is like,
you got to watch a new guys a little bit.
Wait,

791
00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.810
wait,
say that again.
It's,
it's,

792
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:29.410
you should know that a person wearing a newly forged sword will invariably

793
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:33.590
blunder even if that sword cuts well.
Okay,
Gotcha.

794
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.070
So you got to watch your new guys.
And here's the amplification on this one.

795
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:41.150
A sword that is not at least a hundred years old is one that you cannot rely on

796
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:42.850
gut to.
Okay.
Yeah.
It makes sense.

797
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.430
Like young people full of vigor and energy.

798
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.660
The vitality of a young sword is not entirely stable.

799
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.530
You cannot rely on it.
Hey,
you got to watch,

800
00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:59.090
you gotta watch unproven,
unproven,
got to watch him.

801
00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:01.640
That makes sense to me.
And I'm not saying they won't be bad.

802
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:06.350
Asses might be right.
They might be.
I had new guys that were big,

803
00:53:06.351 --> 00:53:07.580
complete bad asses.

804
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.480
But you don't know that outside of new guys where you'd think they're going to

805
00:53:11.481 --> 00:53:15.270
be good.
It's weird man.
I've been talking about bugs a little bit lately.
Sure.

806
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:18.070
Some of my friends you,

807
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:20.450
you have no idea who's going to make it through.

808
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:25.930
You don't know cause it's mental,
right?
You're a mental,
mental,

809
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.920
<v 3>physical.
It's mental and physical.</v>

810
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:33.510
Hey can you get cut from bugs just cause you're not like,
let's see,

811
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.180
is there like I don't,
I don't know.

812
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:39.770
But you know like let's say there's a run and you got gotta you know,
do,

813
00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.170
do they or is there any circumstances that are this or similar to this where

814
00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.960
you're going to make this run in,
you know,
10 minutes,
whatever.

815
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.840
And if you don't make the 10 minutes you're out there.
Stuff like for sure.

816
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.380
Absolutely.
There's a,
there's actually the standard time.

817
00:53:53.381 --> 00:53:57.540
So Ron's had been in place since I went through and they're the same for the,

818
00:53:57.541 --> 00:54:02.310
for what they call a four mile time run the four mile time drawn in first phase.

819
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:06.270
The time.
Maximum time you can take is 32 minutes.

820
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.600
32 minutes.
What do you run in?

821
00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:14.730
That's your your surprise.
Cause that's slow.
Right?
Four mile.

822
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:18.480
That's a time run.
That's an eight minute mile.
That's pretty fast.
What?

823
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.250
It's pretty no,
it's pretty fast.

824
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.620
They didn't second phase it goes down to 30 minutes bro.

825
00:54:22.621 --> 00:54:27.621
You used to run a what to do it but it's not like the team.

826
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:31.090
Let me tell you,
that is not fast.
That is not fast.

827
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.850
In second phase it goes to 30 minutes.
In fourth phase it goes to 28 minutes.

828
00:54:35.851 --> 00:54:38.710
That's a seven minute mile.
That is not fast.
Yeah.

829
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:40.620
I thought you're going to say like 10 minute mile.

830
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:44.790
This is what this is what trips people up or jams people up as you like to say.

831
00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:49.170
What jams people up is when you do the run you're not fresh.

832
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:54.660
That's the thing.
You're not fresh.
You're wearing boots,

833
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:56.250
boots,
you're wearing pants.

834
00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:01.260
You're all in the soft sand on the sand and the sand like part of it will be

835
00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:04.470
hard pack.
Yeah.
But then like part of it's going to be soft and,

836
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:09.030
and this has changed a little bit from what I've been told when I went through

837
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.560
the instructors,
maybe that run was 4.2 miles is 4.5 miles.

838
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:15.840
Maybe it was maybe was 3.8 miles.

839
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:20.520
They'd kind of estimated so if you didn't make it the time,

840
00:55:20.521 --> 00:55:22.170
so we're not,
when I went through,

841
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:26.610
if you didn't make the time for that for run,

842
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.900
they had your name.
If you failed again,
you were done.
Okay,

843
00:55:30.901 --> 00:55:32.880
so it's like one strike.
Yes.
Okay,
got you.

844
00:55:32.881 --> 00:55:36.540
Now the interesting thing is if you failed a run and then you failed to swim,

845
00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:41.420
do you could still,
we would still be there,
but if you failed a runner,

846
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:42.340
so I can you again,

847
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.010
if you failed a run and a swim and you failed an obstacle course,

848
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:50.850
you'd still be there.
Tell one more time.
They call it being on the bubble.

849
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.520
Actually,
I think,
no,
that actually came from officer candidate school.

850
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.980
I don't think we said the bubble.
There's new things that,
that,

851
00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:59.360
that develop in buds that come.
Yeah,

852
00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:02.040
I've heard on the bubble planning times you're on the bubble like they should

853
00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:03.750
have or that just means in general

854
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:11.190
you need to cut
so tanked.
Okay,

855
00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:15.000
so that that's what you mean by its physical cause like yeah,
it's physical.

856
00:56:15.001 --> 00:56:17.040
Like if you don't,
yeah,
you can fail physical.

857
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:18.960
I've been telling people this lately,

858
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:23.620
I had to run as fast as I could possibly run the past the runs for,
for my,

859
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:28.210
I would,
that would be me too.
And the one time,
one time I paced myself,

860
00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:31.210
it was like,
you know what,
I'm just going to pace myself.
Sure,
I'll be fine.

861
00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:35.920
I based myself.
Yeah.
I felt like this puzzle.
Then from then on,

862
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.670
and I had a buddy that was a cross country runner in high school or college or

863
00:56:39.671 --> 00:56:42.890
something and he's like,
hey,
run with me.
And I'm like,
yeah,
I've got,

864
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:46.480
and I didn't like I had brand is hard as it and that's how I had to run every

865
00:56:46.481 --> 00:56:49.900
run.
I had to run as hard as I could.
And there's guys that ran cross country.

866
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:53.320
Those drones are a joke for those guys.
I mean Echo,
it's no big deal for,

867
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:58.360
I mean there's a lot of people that can run five minute miles that are doing

868
00:56:58.361 --> 00:56:59.600
those runs and you know,

869
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.160
a four mile run and like 20 to 22 minutes and that's not true.

870
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.150
I'm surprised that you thought that was fast.

871
00:57:07.151 --> 00:57:09.430
I think I just caught you off guard.
It's slow dude.

872
00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:14.080
It might be slow depending the way me and my fast and depends on when you meet

873
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:15.910
my slow,
when I used to like run,

874
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:20.320
I would run on the treadmill and I would run a seven minute talk to me about the

875
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:24.760
treadmill Trimble's or no,
that's part of my point.
You run on the treadmill.

876
00:57:24.761 --> 00:57:29.140
I'd run like a seven minute mile pace and I'd be like Dang.

877
00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:33.910
And but I'd only do like one mile and it'd be like good.
That's I,
I've,

878
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.180
I've only run on a treadmill like three times easier.

879
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:41.680
It's either you're like if I was on board ships I would run around the flight

880
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:46.270
deck.
So that's what I mean like talking about it,
these guys running seven,

881
00:57:46.271 --> 00:57:47.050
eight minute mile.

882
00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:50.050
Usually when I'd run like four miles or five miles on the treadmill,

883
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:52.510
it'd be like 10 like just under nine minutes,
something.

884
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.060
I don't even know how to translate to treadmill.
I honestly don't.

885
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:59.740
I don't know how that translates.
Yeah,
so I would say it's like,

886
00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.340
but a nine minute mile is pathetic.
Right?
That's,
and that's the pace.

887
00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:06.250
I would run my four miles and it wouldn't be dead,
but I'd be,

888
00:58:06.251 --> 00:58:09.020
that'd be if I'm,
if I,

889
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:12.460
if you want me to run an eight minute,
seven minute,

890
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:14.650
eight minute mile with boots in San,

891
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:19.510
even some of the time you're crazy or you're so distance runners what I'm

892
00:58:19.511 --> 00:58:20.830
hearing apparently.
Yeah.

893
00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.650
I'll be going like you as fast as I possibly can to make it

894
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.510
check
back to the book.

895
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:35.770
While you should select a sword with a handle that as long and thin you should

896
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:38.650
reject any sword with one that is excessively long.

897
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:43.940
I like that.
A lot of these rules are balanced there about balance.

898
00:58:43.941 --> 00:58:47.350
That's what they're about.
Hey,
you want it long and thin but don't.
Not too long.

899
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:50.770
Yeah,
you want a horse that's strong but not overly strong.

900
00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:57.240
This is a lot about balance and here's the amplification.

901
00:58:57.761 --> 00:59:00.850
You are less likely to drop a sword with a thin handle.
However,

902
00:59:00.851 --> 00:59:04.540
in cold weather you are liable to drop a sword with a thick handle.

903
00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.000
For the most part went on horseback.

904
00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:11.440
You should pass a string through the hand guard of your sword and tie it to your

905
00:59:11.441 --> 00:59:16.070
arm.
Once you drop it,
you'll be able to pick it up again.
Have lanyard.
Hm?

906
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:21.160
Have a lanyard on your weapon of a leash.
Haven't board.
No,
that's different.
No

907
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.260
leashes are for dogs.

908
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:29.480
Uh,
I,

909
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:34.100
I had my whole career cattle landed on my pistol.

910
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:39.170
Hmm.
Only needed at one time.
Dang.
I don't think I've even heard of eating meat.

911
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.140
I only dropped my pistol one time,
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.

912
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:48.280
Next.
Again,
balanced.

913
00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:52.520
It is good for the tip of your spear to be long.
However,
if it is too long,

914
00:59:52.521 --> 00:59:53.660
you may find yourself in trouble.

915
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:55.730
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

916
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:58.310
<v 3>Amplification.
The blade on the end of your spirit should be long,</v>

917
00:59:58.311 --> 01:00:02.600
but not excessively.
So if it is too heavy then you'll lose it.
Balance.

918
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:06.770
Got to keep things balanced
next.

919
01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.400
Even if you are able to fly up into the sky without feathers,

920
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:12.320
you have no chance of victory with a spear.

921
01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:17.060
You cannot wield with your own day with two hands.
I liked that one

922
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:23.750
is that kinda like girls over packing for a trip and making you carry their

923
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:26.780
stuff.
I don't think it has anything to do with that.

924
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.360
When you really think about it,
think about it.

925
01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.180
Oh cause she can't carry her own stuff.

926
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:34.880
All her stuff that she needs and she's going to do well on the vacation as far

927
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.640
as comfort goes,
whatever.
But she can't even carry it.

928
01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:43.280
If you would have made it not about vacation but about patrolling through the

929
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:44.030
woods.
Right.

930
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:48.980
Like it's great that you brought a whisper light and extra food and all this

931
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:52.040
other stuff,
but you can't carry it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

932
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:56.230
Remember Leif was talking about that?
Yeah.
The first first patrol,
our body,

933
01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.890
he had 27 and [inaudible].
He was ready for world war three though.

934
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.060
All right.
Yeah,
cause it,

935
01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:10.061
what was the double doozy was getting acclimated to being in the hundred and 20

936
01:01:10.581 --> 01:01:15.140
degree heat and getting acclimated to running around.
The Marine Corps is out.

937
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:16.640
They've been out there for months,

938
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:21.670
sprinting from corner to corner cover to cover and they've already mid minimize

939
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:26.180
their gears somewhat and Lafe shows up.
He,

940
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:29.950
he's not only easy,
a little heavy or maybe even a lot heavy,

941
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.450
but also he's getting acclimated.
So it's a double,
it's a,
it's a one two punch.

942
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.770
All right.
This is a good one.

943
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:41.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

944
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:43.820
<v 3>While the shaft of your spear.</v>

945
01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.280
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

946
01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.900
<v 3>It should be long.
Ignore the ground at your peril.
When I first read that,</v>

947
01:01:49.901 --> 01:01:51.490
I was thinking to myself,
okay,
well what does that mean?

948
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.370
Does that mean ignore the ground?
Here's the amplification.

949
01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.210
The length of store to your sphere as well as a weight lighter,

950
01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:04.030
heavier should differ based on three factors.
You,

951
01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:08.590
your enemy and the battleground.
So even if your spirit sufficient,

952
01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:13.720
not having an understanding of the terrain will def will result in defeat

953
01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:17.080
terrain.
That's what these,
that's what he means by ground.
Yeah.

954
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:20.190
Ignore the ground at your peril.
And

955
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:23.040
<v 0>this is something that's very difficult or it's,</v>

956
01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:25.680
it's something that we don't talk about even even though I've talked about it

957
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:30.300
before,
this podcast for sure.
Knowing terrain,
that's what,
that's what combat is.

958
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:32.010
Combat is knowing and understanding the terrain.

959
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:33.240
It's knowing and understanding the ground.

960
01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:37.090
It's an understanding land features and buildings and what angles.
Yeah.

961
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:42.200
Producing and where you patrol should go and where a good ambush site would be.

962
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:46.800
That is all based on knowing the ground.
The terrain is what we call,

963
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:48.830
we don't call it the ground.
We call it the terrain.
Yeah.

964
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:52.230
Knowing terrain features,
micro features,
micro terrain.

965
01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:56.670
What's this little drawing?
Dead Space.
All these little things are so important,

966
01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:01.590
so that rule absolutely applies to

967
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.760
<v 1>this day.</v>

968
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.030
Next Samurai

969
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:11.880
<v 0>do not gorge themselves at banquets.</v>

970
01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.940
Eating twice a day is more than enough.

971
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:16.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

972
01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.200
<v 0>April vacation.</v>

973
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.010
Samurai must train themselves to be able to withstand hunger and to always be on

974
01:03:21.011 --> 01:03:24.700
their guard from days past.
It was said that two meals a day is plenty.

975
01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:26.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

976
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:29.730
<v 0>It appears there were some people eating three times a day in this era.</v>

977
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:36.770
Dropping the hammer.
Yup.
Do you eat three meals a day?
Three.
Yeah.

978
01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:41.070
Yeah.
Dot.
So
sometimes too,

979
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.920
when I'm feeling,
you know where your spirit,

980
01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:46.990
<v 4>yeah,
I've actually heard that.</v>

981
01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:51.850
I think heuler was the one who told me that the three meals a day,
no,

982
01:03:51.851 --> 01:03:54.610
it wasn't as much as it was the amount of meals that day.

983
01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:59.200
It was like the type of meals,
you know,
they do this heavy meals.

984
01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.370
Oh yeah.
They'd have a certain mix,
like kind of formula,
but Gracie Diet.
Yeah.

985
01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:07.170
And if you notice it,
it's really light bananas and cucumbers and like,
yeah,

986
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:12.040
it's really weird stuff that he made the smoothie from at one time it was like,

987
01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:14.980
there was like,
I want to say a cream cheese in there with watermelon and,

988
01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:18.250
but that,
it was like interesting little mix.
But it was good though.

989
01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:23.410
But it was like,
like a lot of the stuff is late because um,
you know,

990
01:04:23.411 --> 01:04:25.750
when you get a lot of people coming in and trying to challenge you at the

991
01:04:25.751 --> 01:04:27.490
academy,
it's like old school,
you know,
when people,

992
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:30.880
you always gotta be ready gotta be.
Yeah.
So you can't be like,
oh,
I just ate up,

993
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:35.930
you know?
I Dunno.
I don't like people ask me that all the time.
Do you do,

994
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:37.900
what do you eat in the morning before you work out?
I don't think anything.

995
01:04:37.901 --> 01:04:41.650
Nothing.
Yes.
I don't like to eat before I drank.
I agree.
And some people say,
oh,

996
01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:44.560
it's an hour and a half.
If I don't eat an hour and a half before I trained,

997
01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:48.250
I don't even like to eat.
Yeah,
three hours.
I think there might be psychological,

998
01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.860
I mean,
hey look,
everyone's different way.
It's about chicken today.

999
01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.990
We got delayed and I was like,
Hey,
if I don't eat now,
you might get hangry.

1000
01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:59.530
No.
Then by the time we're training tonight,
oh yeah,
Dang.

1001
01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:04.390
Then I would have to eat when we done and then all of a sudden it's 45 minutes

1002
01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:07.160
to an hour and I'm on the mat and I don't like that feeling.
I won't start any.

1003
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.240
My Gut.
Yeah,
I'd rather not eat.

1004
01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:14.230
We'll consider this were in a real general way of explaining it.
If you,
you know,

1005
01:05:14.231 --> 01:05:16.730
when you eat something,
your stomach that'll work.
Just something.
The muscles,

1006
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.100
smooth muscles as

1007
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:22.240
<v 3>opposed to skeletal muscles.
By the way,
smooth muscles,
they gotta get to work.</v>

1008
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.820
Anything,
you know,
enzymes go in there,
all this stuff.

1009
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.550
So when you taking away from your,
let's call it,
yeah,
the blood flow,

1010
01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:33.520
like all of a sudden basically the resources of your buddy started going to your

1011
01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:38.521
stomach now and now you want to demand some resources for the rest of your body.

1012
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:41.680
When you go to train,
the stomach's like,
Hey,
what about us?

1013
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.590
Resources bail from the stomach.
Little bits don't feels upset.

1014
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:49.420
You might throw up or feel like it.
Andy almost puke the other day.
Yeah,

1015
01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:53.200
that's bad.
All right,
same subject.
That's why I'm going to go right to it.

1016
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:55.840
If a Samurai is preparing to step onto the field of battle,

1017
01:05:55.841 --> 01:06:00.370
does wide to avoid is wise to avoid eating anything other than hot water poured

1018
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:03.730
over rice.
So that's one way to do it.

1019
01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:08.860
Keep amplification.
If you eat a lot at a banquet before a great battle,

1020
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:11.200
the food will not have settled.
By the time the fighting starts.

1021
01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:12.470
Echo Charles called it.

1022
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:16.210
If you then were to have your head chopped off,

1023
01:06:16.211 --> 01:06:19.330
all that food would come out and it would make a great big mess.

1024
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.690
Food will not pass down the throat of a coward.

1025
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:28.570
It appears t was not common.
Okay.
Interesting.

1026
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:29.463
Next one.

1027
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:34.930
Something a Samurai should never be without is the thing you use to sharpen your

1028
01:06:34.931 --> 01:06:38.440
blade.
A wet stone makes sense,
right?

1029
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.090
That's the way you bring your rings when you go on drugs.

1030
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:45.880
If I go for multiple days,
if I go,

1031
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:49.570
if I'm only going to be gone for like two or three days,

1032
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:54.280
I will just use whatever random pull up bar I can find her maker.
Yeah.

1033
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:58.330
But if I'm going for five days,
six days,
bring the rings.

1034
01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:01.450
It rings make a big difference if you have rings.

1035
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.840
So many workouts you can do with just rings.
Yeah.
When you think about it,

1036
01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:07.570
and I know this from experience or it's,
it's in my experience,

1037
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.510
it's harder to find something to do pull ups on then what you'd expect you'd

1038
01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:14.920
think,
Oh yeah,
I can just do it like right here or wherever.
It can be harder.

1039
01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:16.180
Yeah you can't.

1040
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:21.750
You can do pushups anywhere.
You can do pushups,
you

1041
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:26.390
incline pushup and you can do all kinds of crazy squats and squats,

1042
01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.600
pistols and jump squats and burpees.

1043
01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:32.890
Pullups that's why rings are key and once you have rings then you can also do

1044
01:07:32.891 --> 01:07:34.570
ring dips.
You can do ring pushups,

1045
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:39.130
you can do like assisted squats if you need them.
I don't really do that.

1046
01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:40.870
But you don't need help.

1047
01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:45.280
Well he's a man bro.

1048
01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.500
I'm not over here bragging about being able to do empty bodyweight squats.
But,

1049
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:56.860
but you can do everything once you have pair rigs and you can usually find a

1050
01:07:56.861 --> 01:08:01.840
place new pullups somewhere.
Parking garage.
They have little overhanging ledges.

1051
01:08:01.841 --> 01:08:04.510
They have eye beams you can hang on to have,

1052
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:07.690
I hate to say it cause I know someone's going to rip it and break it and spray

1053
01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:08.201
water everywhere.

1054
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:12.110
But they have sprinkler systems in there and that's actually the Columbia system

1055
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.380
actually the cast iron where they,
where the sewage goes out of a building.

1056
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:16.430
It's usually a big

1057
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.260
<v 0>pipe and it's hard to do popups,
but it's good.</v>

1058
01:08:19.570 --> 01:08:22.780
<v 4>Yeah,
I don't think that that's good.
I think that's a risk right there.</v>

1059
01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:27.120
It's probably against some sort of a brutal at the hotel.

1060
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.380
Whatever you're talking about here.

1061
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.170
<v 0>Don't tell him I told you.
Yeah.
Blame me.
Taking ownership,</v>

1062
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:37.610
taking ownership of you,
your faults.
Next,

1063
01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:43.040
it is unseemly for a Samurai to be enamored with the flavor of food that has sat

1064
01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:48.041
down before them is best that your meal be a soup made of boiled water poured

1065
01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:51.830
over rice.
That's how they roll,
man.
They're just like,
you know what,

1066
01:08:51.831 --> 01:08:55.160
I'm gonna eat Brice with hot water poured over it.

1067
01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.760
Otherwise you could distractions.
Do you think that that

1068
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.380
that sort of asceticism keeps,
keeps you tougher

1069
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:05.990
<v 4>kind of.
Yeah.
Right away.
It,</v>

1070
01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:10.390
it provides less distraction from your goal cause like in,

1071
01:09:10.391 --> 01:09:14.590
in fitness and you know,
like working out bodybuilding a lot of time,

1072
01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.700
like that's a factor big time because you got to eat a certain amount to

1073
01:09:18.701 --> 01:09:22.180
maintain or gain weight and all this stuff and you know,

1074
01:09:22.181 --> 01:09:25.870
maintain certain backroads,
you know,
fat levels,
all this stuff.

1075
01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:30.760
So you can't just be going to KFC or wherever you think is super delicious and

1076
01:09:30.761 --> 01:09:31.840
just eating it and be like,
hey,

1077
01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.670
you got to have like certain models like lean stuff and you can't add a bunch of

1078
01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:40.900
sauces because there's extra calories in there and all this stuff.
So yeah,

1079
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.520
if you,
if you can endure that kind,

1080
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.160
that kind of food that doesn't necessarily taste that good.
Yeah.

1081
01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:47.590
You can get to your goal way better.

1082
01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:52.090
<v 0>What about Charlie plumb eaten two balls of rice a day for six years.</v>

1083
01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.030
<v 4>Yeah.
I'm sure that,
you know,
that kind of helped him help delayed or what</v>

1084
01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:01.620
it's like accepting of conditions?
Well that,
yeah,

1085
01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:03.660
it's like if you're,

1086
01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:08.810
if you're used to sleeping on the floor with no ac and the heat or whatever.

1087
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:12.510
Yeah.
You know,
you can go sleep on someone's couch,

1088
01:10:12.511 --> 01:10:15.330
you can go get rest pretty much anywhere and that's a good luxury.

1089
01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.760
Especially when you compare it to a situation where you don't,
you,

1090
01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:22.320
you don't have that kind of tolerance,
you know,
you're the kind of were like,

1091
01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:28.020
you need a certain like softness and temperature and noise level to sleep to

1092
01:10:29.011 --> 01:10:31.140
fall asleep.
Yeah.
And then some people will,

1093
01:10:31.141 --> 01:10:33.940
they'll just fall right asleep while you're talking to them if they want to kind

1094
01:10:33.941 --> 01:10:34.620
of,

1095
01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:38.380
<v 0>I can sleep.
I can sleep real easy on airplanes.
Yeah,
me too.</v>

1096
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:43.850
I get a little crunched up in a little ball and just go sleep.
You know what?

1097
01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:46.860
Here's what the,
here's what he actually said.
Here's the amplifying information.

1098
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:50.760
The profession of the Samurai involves being in an extreme environment,

1099
01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.590
therefore gourmet food of is of no benefit to them.
There you go.

1100
01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:00.870
Do you think that people that just eat really,

1101
01:11:00.871 --> 01:11:05.871
really high end food all the time when they go back to eating normal food?

1102
01:11:05.881 --> 01:11:08.010
Is it,
is it like,
are they suffering?

1103
01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:12.780
<v 4>Yeah,
probably a little bit,
yeah.
In one way.
It depends how they regard it.</v>

1104
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:13.860
You cause he knows.

1105
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:18.510
<v 3>But you know what's funny?
When I was a kid we'd like,
I eat a lot of stake now.</v>

1106
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.290
Sure.
When I was a kid we didn't even eat steak.
Steak costs a lot of money.

1107
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:26.520
It does.
And,
and when I was a kid,
we hamburgers.
Sure.

1108
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:31.140
A lot of hamburgers.
Yeah.
Not as much.
Yeah.

1109
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.680
I didn't even like steak when I got in the navy.
I didn't like steak.
Huh?

1110
01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.330
Didn't like it.
I had to.
I didn't,
I just wasn't used to it.
Yeah.

1111
01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.370
It took me a couple of years before I started liking steak.
Yeah.

1112
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:44.550
Usually you hit that one steak that's like prepared perfectly.

1113
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:47.820
And then in your mind you're like,
Dang,
I love steak now.

1114
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.750
And then even if you get it other stake that wasn't prepared that perfectly

1115
01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:55.520
[inaudible] over.
I don't presume it happened to me.
Yeah.
Don't,

1116
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.230
maybe it's just like,
uh,
I remember eating burgers at Wendy's though.

1117
01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:02.490
Check.
All right.
Next.

1118
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:07.050
When entering a Confrontation Samurai should neither look back on the path

1119
01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:10.740
traveled nor what is off to left or right.

1120
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:16.690
So to me that says,
I will prioritize and execute,

1121
01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:19.360
right and don't be looking around you.
You see what you see,
what you got to,

1122
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.120
you see what you got to do.
You've got a confrontation in front of you.

1123
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:25.760
Here's the implication from the onset,
you should place yourself,

1124
01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:29.530
place your full concentration on the battle and not allow your focus to lapse

1125
01:12:29.531 --> 01:12:33.490
during the course of the battle.
The most important aspects of the battle,

1126
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:38.950
the most important aspects of battle or the use of people and the use of natural

1127
01:12:38.951 --> 01:12:42.590
geography,
right?

1128
01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.500
You're a leader.
You got to use your people correctly.

1129
01:12:45.501 --> 01:12:48.500
And as I just talked about terrain using the natural geography,

1130
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:50.150
those are the two most important things.

1131
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.120
Now,
can you get target fixation?
Yes,
you can.

1132
01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.670
So you can get so focused that you don't,

1133
01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.320
if you don't pay attention to what's going on left and right,

1134
01:13:00.321 --> 01:13:01.700
you might get flagged.
Yeah,

1135
01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.990
so you've got to watch out for that one next.

1136
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:11.450
Samurais should mind neither of the heat of summer nor the cold of winter as

1137
01:13:11.451 --> 01:13:15.890
they raced through fields and over mountains,
exhausting their bodies.
Boom.

1138
01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:21.110
You got to train it and heat and cold.
Yeah.
That's welcome to the military.

1139
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.440
You freeze and you sweat.
That's the way it works.
Yeah.

1140
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:27.950
It's funny Tony,

1141
01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:32.980
Freddy and you kind of turned me on to just mentally,

1142
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.710
it's more like putting your mind at a certain,

1143
01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.710
in a certain way where sure it'll be cold,

1144
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:42.830
but it's not about how cold or not cold it is.
Sure.
It'll be hot.

1145
01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:46.970
It's not about how hot or not hot it is and you can't complain about that stuff.

1146
01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.780
And if you complain that's like that's the part that's going to jam.
Yeah.

1147
01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.580
Just how you regarded.
You cannot complain in the teams.

1148
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:59.030
Here's what's funny.
Here's what's funny and I just,

1149
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:04.190
you can experience this really easily.
Let's say you,
you and me are out

1150
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:10.140
at the beach and it's warm,
but out here in California wants a song goes down.

1151
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:14.440
Cool off.
Really?
You don't have a sweatshirt weather you need to do y.
Yeah,

1152
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:18.040
you've got a sweatshirt in your bag.

1153
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:21.460
Maybe I have one too.

1154
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:24.430
Cause actually this is a contradiction because if I don't bring one that means

1155
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:27.940
I'm not well prepared.
So I got one in my bag to put it off.

1156
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:31.540
Take it out.
You put it around your waist.
No,
I'm not gonna do that.

1157
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.760
I'm not going to do that.
It's going to leave it.
You would not want it.

1158
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:38.860
You just want to BTF.
As long as you can just suck it up.
I don't want,

1159
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:42.790
I don't want you to see me putting on a sweatshirt indicating to you that I was

1160
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:46.000
called a uncomfortable.
Now I'm going to succumb to pamper myself.
Not Happening.

1161
01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.000
What if I wasn't there?
Probably have.
I'll put the sweatshirt on all their like,

1162
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:54.760
yeah,
this is just straight up.
No,
there's,
there's no denying that.

1163
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.440
That's so funny because before I thought like that I would have thought that's

1164
01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:03.430
so dumb.
Like put on your suit,
you're ruining your experience or whatever.

1165
01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:05.200
You're at the beach with your whatever friends.

1166
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:06.940
If this actually happened yesterday

1167
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:14.470
at a surf contest and the clouds came in and it got cool and my buddy,

1168
01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:20.470
he goes off,
it's like having to go put a sweatshirt on and I was like,
Oh really?

1169
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:25.970
Then we both went and got her sweatshirts.
But you let him do it.

1170
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.200
He wasn't in the teams too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it wasn't just trying to,

1171
01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:31.970
because there's always that little thing going on in the teams,

1172
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:35.710
but I kind of feel like,
and it goes on in general to just just,
you know,

1173
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.890
fully like you get a rock in your shoe,
just don't,

1174
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:45.520
just don't get it out and leave it in there.
Before that episode with Tony,

1175
01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:49.240
like I would be the guy,
it'd be like,
no,
I'm cold.
I can't relate.
But after that,

1176
01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:53.800
for some reason I think it just morphed in my mind to like just got a PTF and

1177
01:15:53.801 --> 01:15:58.750
you kind of take pride in it,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.
Next

1178
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:02.740
as Samurai,

1179
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:06.550
you should take it upon yourself to spend time playing in water.

1180
01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:11.050
Not doing so could well result in disaster.

1181
01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.520
That's part one,
obviously.
I agree with that one.

1182
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:20.250
You gotta be in the water part two Samurai should,

1183
01:16:20.251 --> 01:16:24.610
as a matter of course,
engage in contests of strength.

1184
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.780
If you do not,
then your muscles will become slack.

1185
01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:31.300
Obviously I support that one.

1186
01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.930
I don't know if this guy were just wanting me to read this book because he knew

1187
01:16:34.931 --> 01:16:37.000
that I was going to be,
I mean,
how could you not?

1188
01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:40.260
How does that not relate to everything that I talk about all the time?
Yeah.

1189
01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:43.750
Be in the water workout.

1190
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:46.790
Here's what's funny about this one.

1191
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:53.250
He says that the peasants strength in themselves with their day to day labor and

1192
01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:57.070
they also test themselves by lifting and carrying large stones in front of the

1193
01:16:57.071 --> 01:17:00.880
local shrines and did pushups in order to build their muscles and thereby

1194
01:17:00.881 --> 01:17:03.730
increase their overall strength.
However,

1195
01:17:03.731 --> 01:17:06.010
beginning in the Migi era,

1196
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.800
such feats of strength became began to be ridiculed

1197
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.780
<v 4>and the use of rocks dwindled.</v>

1198
01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.490
Thus it is hardly a surprise that the youth of today are weak.

1199
01:17:18.370 --> 01:17:22.610
Yeah,
it could.
And also it's kind of like that.
Now we're like,
you know,

1200
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.670
let's say grip,
let's say quote unquote grown adults.
Right?

1201
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.920
Let's see who can lift that rock.
That's cool though.
Right?

1202
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:34.880
Why do you say that?
Weird voice?
No.
Because I would say generally speaking,

1203
01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:37.550
that's kind of like,
oh,
you taught children,
you know,

1204
01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:40.370
like what are you guys doing?
Oh,
people make fun of that.
Yeah.

1205
01:17:40.371 --> 01:17:43.370
If [inaudible] are having little feats of strength competitions,

1206
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:46.430
what do you think of her?
The crossfit games are though.
Yeah,

1207
01:17:46.431 --> 01:17:48.530
but do you think this world's strongest man is?

1208
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:52.340
What do you think the UFC is totally agree.

1209
01:17:52.341 --> 01:17:56.600
But I think if it's not like organized and then like presented,
you know,

1210
01:17:56.601 --> 01:17:57.170
kind of thing.

1211
01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:59.810
Like if me and you were just cruising at the beach and then I'm like,
oh,

1212
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.010
that's funny.

1213
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:06.010
We did me and mean Halleck went to Australia.

1214
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:09.770
Right.
And we're like,
oh,
cruise in some downtime.
We're filming this,
this,
um,

1215
01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:10.653
you know,
this video.

1216
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:15.710
And Brad just turned into that bowl 100%.
It was just me and him.

1217
01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.310
So it w we went from pushups.
He was like,
hey.
He's like,
Hey,

1218
01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:23.540
what about the challenge you did?
The challenge you did in,
in Maine?

1219
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:28.700
Yay.
Example bag.
Yes.
Missed it.
Got a shoulder,

1220
01:18:28.701 --> 01:18:31.460
the bag of gravel.
Yeah.
By the way.

1221
01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:36.010
So it's not like a 200 pound barbell gravel thing.
Yeah.
See,

1222
01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:39.990
and that's a perfect example,
but that makes you strong.
I think so too.
Yeah,

1223
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:44.510
I agree with,
I agree with it.
I'm just,
I'm just saying like if,

1224
01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:49.540
let's say we were all at a barbecue with just a vast variety and be like,

1225
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:53.870
that's totally acceptable.
You know,
the 200 pound bag challenge,

1226
01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:58.520
it's all just guys like you know,
but if we were at a barbecue,
you know,

1227
01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:02.480
let's say my daughter was a birthday party or something and your kettle bells

1228
01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:04.450
out,
right?
Yeah.

1229
01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:09.920
If I challenge you today to a kettle bell,
like let's see who can do the night,

1230
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:13.640
whatever the the 90 pound one or something at my daughter's birthday party.

1231
01:19:13.641 --> 01:19:15.650
I think aside from me,

1232
01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.680
you and maybe a handful of other guys that are our direct peers site from them,

1233
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.550
I think people would be like,
you guys are dumb.

1234
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.700
That's what I think they might be right there.
All right.

1235
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:30.170
Next.

1236
01:19:33.210 --> 01:19:36.960
If you allow Your Samurai spirit to wither clearly,

1237
01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.390
your body will then follow suit.

1238
01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:43.320
Your skin will begin to stretch as you gain weight.

1239
01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:45.723
<v 5>Part one.</v>

1240
01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:49.330
<v 4>I think we all just agree with that point.
Yes,
outright.</v>

1241
01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:54.400
Do you think that,
this goes back to the comfort question?

1242
01:19:57.090 --> 01:20:00.420
Let's take Jujitsu at a certain point where you say,

1243
01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.480
I don't really care if I get caught by this guy or you know what I'm that guy's

1244
01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.070
training for and hey,
if

1245
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:12.900
<v 3>he catches me,
you know what I mean?
Yeah,
yeah.
I see what you're asking to.</v>

1246
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:17.690
So,
so,
so my point is,
at a certain point you,
you,

1247
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:22.610
you accept,
you accept it.
Yeah.
Huh?

1248
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.520
Do you think that's okay?
I do think it's okay.
I don't,
I know you don't.

1249
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:28.680
And it's not an absolute yes.

1250
01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:33.760
Not so the door when the door is,
you know,
hey,
hey,

1251
01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:38.710
it's okay.
I'm,
I'm all the excuses,
right?
Yeah.

1252
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:40.081
Hey,
you know,

1253
01:20:40.081 --> 01:20:44.640
these guys are young and they're training for the th th th this competition or

1254
01:20:44.641 --> 01:20:47.130
that competition,
you know,
got to get in there with them.

1255
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:51.740
When I hear that knock and I slammed the door,
red flag violation,

1256
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.080
actually I opened the door and I choke that it out.
Bring it.
Yeah.

1257
01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:58.110
I dig it and then I'm not,
you can see what I see.

1258
01:20:58.111 --> 01:21:02.340
I think that when you accept that,
I feel,
yeah.
When you accept it.
Yeah.

1259
01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:05.610
And the other thing that happens is your ego gets in the way,
right?
Because,

1260
01:21:05.710 --> 01:21:09.860
because what happens is you don't want to,
you don't want to get tapped out.
Yeah.

1261
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:12.750
That's bad.
So you don't want to get tapped out so you're not going to try it.

1262
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.140
Yeah.
And it,
that happens.
Yeah.

1263
01:21:16.141 --> 01:21:20.640
Fully in all the different things that all kind of enter into the equation.

1264
01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:24.090
So again,
it comes back to like,
why are you,
why are you training?

1265
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:27.750
Like why are you there introduced through or whatever.
Like why are you there?

1266
01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:31.260
So yeah,
if this thing,
what he's talking about where it's like,
okay,

1267
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:32.580
if you're like letting yourself go,

1268
01:21:32.581 --> 01:21:37.230
if you're kind of giving up and then justifying it with,
in this case,
oh,
I'm old,

1269
01:21:37.231 --> 01:21:41.820
they're training for world and that's your,
your version of giving up,

1270
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.310
then yeah,
that's bad.
But if it's like,

1271
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:49.650
let's say you're like an older guy or whatever and maybe you kind of lost a step

1272
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:53.510
or whatever,
you know,
like,
like people do when they get older sometimes.
Um,

1273
01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:57.240
and you're like,
hey,
you know,
this guy's getting nuts.

1274
01:21:57.241 --> 01:22:00.820
If I rise to that level of intensity,
I could get hurt or something like that.

1275
01:22:00.821 --> 01:22:05.450
And,
and it's like an okay decision knows,
knows you can be smart.
Yeah.

1276
01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:07.620
Yeah.
For instance,

1277
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.280
if everyone's doing take downs and your knees a little bit tweaked to go,
hey,

1278
01:22:11.281 --> 01:22:14.220
you know what exactly right.
That's something I need to check myself on.

1279
01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:17.610
Sometimes you do shit

1280
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:23.550
but makes eye.
But that's a big one though.
Like when you,

1281
01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:27.000
when you start like what I'm talking about,
what it is you,

1282
01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.130
when you allow Your Samurai spirit to with her,

1283
01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.770
that's what we were talking about.
When you start saying,
hey,
you know what,

1284
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:35.760
I'd rather still just keep fighting even though you're getting beat.

1285
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.090
Cause the young buck is coming up and sharing and getting to train more than you

1286
01:22:39.091 --> 01:22:43.140
and you've got to work and hey,
you know what,
come tap me out then.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1287
01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:47.920
You still got it like maintained the spirit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of,

1288
01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.690
lot of times when people get married or they,
um,

1289
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:55.790
they stopped training or whatever and they blame it on the marriage or they

1290
01:22:55.981 --> 01:22:59.810
blame it on their careers or something like that,
it's like,
ah,
I lost it.

1291
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.900
You know what I do when people say that?
People say,
I'll say,
oh,
you know,

1292
01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:06.010
someone will talking to someone,
they will,
you

1293
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.500
<v 0>don't,
man.
I used to train a lot and I'll be like,
oh,
I mean,
oh,
wait,
what?</v>

1294
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:12.550
What happened?
And as we know,
I got,
I got two kids and you know,

1295
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:14.920
I was just working a lot and I was like,
oh yeah,
I got four kids

1296
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.740
<v 4>in their,
in their defense,
everybody's different.</v>

1297
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:24.730
If they have two kids you have for their net,
you and their kids aren't here,

1298
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.400
so there's that.
Plus my wife,
it was good to go.
Yeah,

1299
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.770
it does make it hard.
It totally does.

1300
01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.280
And it does make it harder with the kids and a career and stuff like that and

1301
01:23:36.281 --> 01:23:38.740
say it was easy.
That's what I was going to say.

1302
01:23:38.741 --> 01:23:40.520
It's like could be slightly invalid.

1303
01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:44.350
It's invalid at the end of the day because you need to Kep your warrior,

1304
01:23:44.351 --> 01:23:47.800
your summarize spirit or you didn't and if you didn't,

1305
01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:50.590
then you allowed these things which are true by the way,

1306
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:54.100
by your as far as what you're,
not you,
but obviously this person,

1307
01:23:54.101 --> 01:23:57.790
this hypothetical person,
if their career or family got in the way,

1308
01:23:57.791 --> 01:24:00.340
you allowed that to happen.
It's not easy.

1309
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:03.880
Totally not easy sup to you though.
At the end of the day,

1310
01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:06.083
<v 5>I think</v>

1311
01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:09.440
<v 0>Samurai are never without a sword on their hip.</v>

1312
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.900
This means of course that an armed enemy will arm himself,

1313
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:16.730
so you got to always expect,
in my mind,

1314
01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:22.240
always expect that your opponent is going to be armed business life,

1315
01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.980
whatever you're doing always,

1316
01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:28.430
you can always expect that your opponent is ready.

1317
01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:33.230
<v 5>Hmm.
I always expect them to be ready next.</v>

1318
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:38.800
<v 0>As a Samurai you should take care as to where your feet step as a matter of</v>

1319
01:24:38.801 --> 01:24:39.634
course,

1320
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:43.990
you never want to be off balance in case the unexpected occurs.

1321
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:45.970
Well that's pretty self explanatory.

1322
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:51.160
The amplifying information says Sam or I have to keep themselves prepared at all

1323
01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:52.090
times to respond.

1324
01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.870
They have to be able to react calmly in a situation without any panic.
Boom.

1325
01:24:57.890 --> 01:25:00.050
Again,
does that apply to everything?
Yes,
it does.

1326
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:01.583
<v 5>No doubt about it.</v>

1327
01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:09.100
<v 0>Samurai who are not aware of the things they should know are like cats that do</v>

1328
01:25:09.831 --> 01:25:11.210
not know how to catch mice

1329
01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:16.070
not aware of things they should know.

1330
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:17.860
<v 5>Hmm.
Yeah.</v>

1331
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.800
<v 0>Samurais should be continuously thinking about military manners matters.</v>

1332
01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:27.850
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1333
01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:29.560
<v 0>Fail to do this at your peril.</v>

1334
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:35.770
Those that serve in the military should be in a continuous state of thinking of

1335
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:40.771
warfare to be negligent in this will result in failure and defeat.

1336
01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:45.630
You know what I told us?

1337
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:50.750
I tell us the young military people that I work with that this is your job,

1338
01:25:51.361 --> 01:25:52.350
this is your profession,

1339
01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.160
and you got to do everything you can to master it and that means what is being

1340
01:25:58.891 --> 01:26:02.490
said right here.
Continuously thinking about military matters matters.

1341
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:10.990
<v 3>Any Samurai who spends too much time playing ball Cotto guitar plucking the</v>

1342
01:26:12.321 --> 01:26:15.860
mouth harp or playing the flute are liable to become a coward.

1343
01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:22.790
And here it says those in the military should never become overly and fashioned

1344
01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:26.180
it infatuated with diversionary games.
Gotcha.
Okay.

1345
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.010
Now at some point I'd like to get better at guitar,
but apparently you know,

1346
01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.390
you get it wrong,
turn it downward.

1347
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:40.910
Next,
Wallace Samurai may be clumsy about some things.
The spear,

1348
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:45.110
the horse and the bow should not be among them.
I like that.

1349
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.890
This one is key.

1350
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:54.490
Samurai should make a habit of regularly listening to tales of military combat

1351
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.860
and rely on the learning.
Found their in.

1352
01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.600
This is a blatant plug for Jocko podcast I think,

1353
01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:10.400
and here's the amplifying information.
By listening to such tales regularly,

1354
01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:15.200
it will keep them fresh in your mind.
When actual combat arises,

1355
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:19.040
they will be of benefit.
Boom,

1356
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:22.250
boom.
And I've definitely got that feedback.

1357
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:27.310
I've gotten all kinds of good feedback about that from guys in the military that

1358
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:31.130
they can relate because I'm telling you the stories that we tell over and over

1359
01:27:31.131 --> 01:27:35.960
again,
they're stories that happened are real things.

1360
01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:39.170
Firing,
maneuver.
There's people acting weird.
There's the enemy doing things.

1361
01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.160
These things are real.
It is definitely helpful.
The more you,

1362
01:27:43.161 --> 01:27:47.090
I wish I would've known more when I was in,
I would have been infinitely better.

1363
01:27:48.690 --> 01:27:51.410
You don't have enough of a focus on it though.
Yeah.

1364
01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:55.030
It kind of goes for everything to Ya.
Like cause it kind of keeps your whole um,

1365
01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.600
like approach to life in that,
that battle frame,

1366
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.860
you know,
so everything,
you know,
it gives you different perspective.

1367
01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:05.660
And I talk about this all the time.
If,

1368
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:09.800
if you learn the arm bar right from the mountain,
you learn it one way,

1369
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:13.970
but you don't realize,
man,
there's,
there's infinitely different ways to do it.

1370
01:28:13.971 --> 01:28:17.510
You can get it from the guard,
you can get it from the bottom position,

1371
01:28:17.511 --> 01:28:19.400
you can get it from across side.
You can get all the,

1372
01:28:19.410 --> 01:28:21.590
you can get the arm lock from all these different positions.

1373
01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.920
And every time you see it from a different angle,
you get better at all of them.

1374
01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.220
So every time you see a military situation from a different angle,

1375
01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:30.800
from a leadership perspective,
from the ground trooper,
from perspective,

1376
01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:33.380
from the cold,
for the hot,
from the desert,
from the mountains,

1377
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:37.860
you learn something,
it makes you better at it.
So,

1378
01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:40.820
so looking at things through that for,
you know,
whatever it may be,

1379
01:28:40.821 --> 01:28:42.980
whether it be military history,
whatever,

1380
01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:48.200
you're always kind of looking at things in that way.
Like we had this guy,

1381
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:51.620
we called him uncle Jill.
He was a friend of the family in Hawaii,

1382
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:55.480
in Hawaii and his,
he was a really good artist,

1383
01:28:55.481 --> 01:28:58.700
but he climbed trees and take us just the tree climbing.

1384
01:28:58.701 --> 01:29:01.980
I know random he'd thing actually me talking it right now,
but it was

1385
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.560
super good fun.
But this guy,
he'd always be like,

1386
01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:09.300
there's reason that there's an instinct of,
of climate,
right?

1387
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.230
P I think humans have an instinct to climb things.
Yeah.
Makes Sense.
I don't know.

1388
01:29:13.630 --> 01:29:15.770
He seems like it.
Yeah.
Okay.
And Air,

1389
01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:18.840
it would be weird because he pulled out that climbing thing.
He'd be like,

1390
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.770
I bet I could climb up there.
You know,
that it's kind of like,
Dang,

1391
01:29:22.771 --> 01:29:26.550
if you kind of have these like looking at things through frames that are,

1392
01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:29.520
that are useful,
you know,
like I think it's like,
man,

1393
01:29:29.521 --> 01:29:33.410
you can figure a lot of things out then you,
a lot of people wouldn't figure out,

1394
01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.820
you know,
like I know V it was like that for sure.

1395
01:29:35.821 --> 01:29:38.610
But like thing that's like a good shot.
How that,
you know,
no ones don't care.

1396
01:29:38.611 --> 01:29:40.410
That's just a beach or whatever.

1397
01:29:40.411 --> 01:29:45.330
But I was a young enlisted guy and I had a friend that would,
would,

1398
01:29:45.331 --> 01:29:49.950
uh,
he would kind of like your friend,
like,
like to climb things.

1399
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:52.860
This guy would jump off things with Joe.
Uncle Joe would climb things.

1400
01:29:52.861 --> 01:29:57.420
This guy would jump off and we were on this obstacle course,

1401
01:29:57.750 --> 01:30:01.590
this random obstacle course.
Then he climbed,
he also liked to climb,

1402
01:30:01.591 --> 01:30:04.950
but then he got to the top of this thing.
He was probably,

1403
01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.560
let's call it 18 feet.
And I'm,
um,

1404
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:13.320
I slid down the rope and the other guy slid down the rope and the chief that we

1405
01:30:13.321 --> 01:30:14.410
are with slid down the rope

1406
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:20.370
and I look up and ego and he's got kinda got like an a puzzled look on his face.

1407
01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.170
The Guy Jumper,
the jumper has got like a,
uh,

1408
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:27.270
a curious look on his face and he says,

1409
01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:32.690
I think I could jump down this 18 feet and I go do it.

1410
01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:39.330
And the chief goes,
don't do it.
And he said,

1411
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:43.260
I think I could make it and that.
And I said,
do it.
And the chief says,

1412
01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:47.310
don't do it.
And I go,
10 bucks,

1413
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.450
chief goes,
shut up Jocko,
don't do it.

1414
01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:55.860
And I go 20 bucks.
And he goes,

1415
01:30:55.861 --> 01:31:00.780
shut up and write as he saying that the jumper jumped and did it and he made it

1416
01:31:01.150 --> 01:31:03.990
jump like 18 feet down.
Just landed PLF,

1417
01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:07.320
PLF parachute landing fall.
Oh wait.

1418
01:31:07.321 --> 01:31:10.980
You break it down and roll kind of.
It's almost like a judo fall,
but with your,

1419
01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:15.420
yeah,
kind of like it disperses the way he did it.

1420
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:17.790
That's good man in trouble.

1421
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:23.560
In a good hearted way.
Nah,
man,
you could've gotten her.
No.

1422
01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:26.880
It would've been your fault.
All that kind of thing.
It would have been.
Yeah,

1423
01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:27.714
I know.
I know.

1424
01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:32.790
You knew his jumping weakness is addiction to jumping in.
You exploited it.

1425
01:31:33.390 --> 01:31:38.390
Next Samurai should keep in their hearts the fact that they only die once.

1426
01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:42.240
Forgetting this will result in failure.

1427
01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:46.560
Samurai who forget this is the,
this is so this,

1428
01:31:46.561 --> 01:31:48.750
this one's a little bit tricky for me to understand.

1429
01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:52.920
Samurai should keep in their hearts the fact that they only die once for getting

1430
01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:57.921
this will result in failure and the amplification on this one says Samurai who

1431
01:31:58.651 --> 01:32:00.070
forget that they can die at

1432
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.750
<v 0>any time and in any place could end up in humiliating failure.</v>

1433
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:06.940
In other words,

1434
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
throwing your body into the river and relying on feet to determine if you float

1435
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.510
to the shallows.
If you love your life too much,

1436
01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:17.900
you will always add didn't failure.

1437
01:32:17.901 --> 01:32:21.380
So this is what I found interesting about this one.
There's a dichotomy here.
Hmm.

1438
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:24.280
The dichotomy to me is if,

1439
01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:26.680
if you care too much about being alive,

1440
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:30.070
then you won't take any risk and you will be too scared and you'll that's going

1441
01:32:30.071 --> 01:32:32.740
to be bad.
Yeah.
So that,
that's that we know that that one's bad.

1442
01:32:32.741 --> 01:32:34.840
So we know we get that one.
If you love your life too much,

1443
01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:37.420
you will always end in failure.
Maybe not always,

1444
01:32:37.421 --> 01:32:41.230
but it's going to definitely play a role.
You'll be too cautious.

1445
01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:44.260
You won't take any risk.
You'll be scared that one's going to be,
you'll hesitate.

1446
01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:47.020
Yeah.
So we get that one.
Um,

1447
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:51.580
the keeping your hearts that you only die once.

1448
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.040
Okay.
So that means to me,
okay,

1449
01:32:54.041 --> 01:32:56.710
so you can die at any time.

1450
01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:01.780
I'm going to make it worth it in my mind.
Make it dope.
Yeah.
Make it dope.
Okay.

1451
01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:05.320
And then this whole thing about,
okay,
let me read it word for word.

1452
01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:10.600
Throwing your body into the river and relying on feet to determine if you float

1453
01:33:10.601 --> 01:33:14.350
to the shallows.
I don't know.

1454
01:33:14.410 --> 01:33:16.300
To me that could be taken two ways

1455
01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:22.720
and I think they're both okay.
Number one is like,
Hey,
don't just throw,
just,

1456
01:33:22.721 --> 01:33:24.700
just jump.
Don't just jump into the river.

1457
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:27.250
See and let fate decide if you're going to make her,
I don't know.

1458
01:33:27.251 --> 01:33:30.070
You prepare and you train and you're ready.

1459
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:31.143
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

1460
01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.370
<v 0>The other way it can be taken us.
You know what?
You can't control everything.</v>

1461
01:33:36.371 --> 01:33:39.790
You got to go jump into the river and if you,
if you're meant to make it,

1462
01:33:39.791 --> 01:33:43.900
you're going to make it either one of those can possibly set your mind at ease.

1463
01:33:43.901 --> 01:33:44.440
And what I,

1464
01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.600
you know when you've heard me talk about fear to take away the warrior kid,

1465
01:33:46.601 --> 01:33:50.230
right?
Yeah.
Weigh the warrior king.
What happens?
You prepare everything you can,

1466
01:33:50.231 --> 01:33:52.270
but then eventually you gotta jump and see if the water,

1467
01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.630
do you feel current takes you to the shallow water again?
Yeah.

1468
01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.240
That's the way it's got to be.
Yeah.
So that's the way I took that one.
Yeah.

1469
01:33:58.330 --> 01:33:59.500
I read a lot into that one.

1470
01:33:59.530 --> 01:34:02.920
I think the first one just because the other one would do would add kind of

1471
01:34:02.921 --> 01:34:06.160
additional x like requirement required explanation.
Like

1472
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:11.340
you agree with preparing I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I agree with her parent.
I think the,

1473
01:34:11.341 --> 01:34:12.670
the of the two that you just said,

1474
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:15.610
the first one I think makes more sense to me that that's what he meant.

1475
01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.300
So you're,
you're thinking that he meant

1476
01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:23.270
to prepare the best of your ability.
Yeah,
exactly right.

1477
01:34:23.271 --> 01:34:27.140
Like he like it's Kinda like you only have one life and if you're going to die,

1478
01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:30.740
make it legit.
Don't be dying trying to cross the river.

1479
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:34.250
You better die doing something big time,
you know,
kind of thing.

1480
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:39.490
There's one more little addition that I believe that Eric actually added on

1481
01:34:40.071 --> 01:34:41.480
here.
Yeah.
This is his note.

1482
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:44.670
It says the line about throwing your body into the river and relying on faith to

1483
01:34:44.671 --> 01:34:47.090
determine if you floated the shallows is a very famous,

1484
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:49.640
it's not that famous because I googled it.
I couldn't find it.

1485
01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.960
Now he says,
enter battle fleet,

1486
01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.280
fully committed and perhaps you will emerge at the end.

1487
01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:03.260
I think that makes some sense.
It's for me,

1488
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.020
prepare the best of your ability.
Yeah.

1489
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:09.410
Be fully committed and then don't worry about what the is going to come because

1490
01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:13.010
you can't control everything.
I think we're good.
I think we'll agree.

1491
01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.030
Now this one I had to,
I had to

1492
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:22.930
dig on this one a little bit too.
Samurais study a great many things.
However,

1493
01:35:22.931 --> 01:35:25.810
the single focus of their learning is death

1494
01:35:29.170 --> 01:35:30.003
and then

1495
01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.220
<v 1>okay.</v>

1496
01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:32.580
<v 0>Thee,</v>

1497
01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:37.580
the amplified information here is whilst Samurai do intensive training and study

1498
01:35:38.851 --> 01:35:40.020
a variety of topics,

1499
01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:45.200
what it all boils down to is seeking death so that that kind of,

1500
01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:46.763
that one

1501
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:52.200
I tried to figure out what that meant or at least what it means to me,

1502
01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.380
and I think too,
the most positive way I could cause seeking death.

1503
01:35:58.381 --> 01:36:00.890
Right.
They are you really seeking death?
Is that what you're trying to do?
Well,

1504
01:36:00.891 --> 01:36:04.890
no.
If you're,
you're not helping the cause.
If you're seeking death,
right.

1505
01:36:04.891 --> 01:36:07.620
You don't want to die.
Yeah.
That's not our goal.

1506
01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.840
It's an occurrence that could happen in a matter of fact,

1507
01:36:09.841 --> 01:36:11.070
that's going to happen all of us,

1508
01:36:11.610 --> 01:36:15.780
but the way I look at it is what we're trying to learn.

1509
01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:20.100
We're trying to understand and master his death and the fear of death.

1510
01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:25.620
If we can get over that
little hurdle.

1511
01:36:25.621 --> 01:36:27.180
Yeah,
little hurdle.
Right.

1512
01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:31.890
Then you've mastered that and once you're actually saying,
I'm going forward.

1513
01:36:32.190 --> 01:36:35.820
Yeah,
I'm prepared,
then we're good,
we're good.

1514
01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.020
<v 4>B also just like just,
you know,
as far as seeking challenges go,</v>

1515
01:36:41.050 --> 01:36:43.590
you want to seek one challenge,
then you want to seek a bigger challenge.

1516
01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:46.780
But he says he can guess Bro.
Yeah,
that's what I mean though.

1517
01:36:46.781 --> 01:36:51.781
So you're pursuing the ultimate challenge that bt kind of like go through what

1518
01:36:51.851 --> 01:36:56.590
your average point break come on board.
Yes.
There you go.
Where you know Bodie,

1519
01:36:56.830 --> 01:37:01.330
he's looking for the Wa the 50 year storm.
Remember it's the same thing.

1520
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:03.280
So he's like I'm going to be there and all this stuff.

1521
01:37:03.281 --> 01:37:05.950
He's always trying to push the limit.
All these things,
bank robbery,

1522
01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:09.360
skydive and all this stuff and you know,
finds the PR.

1523
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:14.230
The 50 year storm knows it hundred percent knows it.
In fact,

1524
01:37:14.231 --> 01:37:16.420
I was kind of like his escape from the law

1525
01:37:18.730 --> 01:37:21.640
catch one of those least dies.
Everyone knew it.

1526
01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:25.510
Did he really die or with it or a sequel where he lived,
he died.

1527
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.990
It was all kind of,
I guess now that you mentioned it for a seat,

1528
01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.620
there's room for a sequel.
Exactly.
Right.
But he was equal.

1529
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:35.050
They remade the same movie.
Yeah.
Do you see that one?
No,
not bad.

1530
01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:38.050
Let's see what they're doing there.
Um,
you know,
a little bit too.

1531
01:37:38.051 --> 01:37:41.440
Like you could tell they're trying to target maybe some teenagers or something

1532
01:37:41.441 --> 01:37:45.310
like that,
but,
um,
not bad.
Sat through it.
Glad I,
it wasn't a waste of time.

1533
01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:52.020
<v 0>All right.
This one again,
had to,</v>

1534
01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.180
had to dig a little deeper on this one.
If you were to ask what con,

1535
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.590
what is it that concerns a Samurai?

1536
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:03.390
The answer is I want to live.
I want to live.
Okay.

1537
01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.513
So,

1538
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:07.050
<v 2>okay.</v>

1539
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:10.620
<v 0>To break that down a little bit,
I look at the word concerns</v>

1540
01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.990
and what concerns means isn't worries or it's not,

1541
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:18.810
I don't think they're using it more like,
oh,
that,
that concerns me.
Yeah.
Like,

1542
01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.790
like it's not saying,
Hey,
what,
what,

1543
01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.070
what concerns me or what I'm thinking about.
It's what I'm worried about.

1544
01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:29.400
What I'm worried about is someone that's saying,
I want to live.
I want to live.

1545
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.390
That's what they're worried about.
Gotcha.

1546
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:32.730
Cause someone that's saying I want to live in.

1547
01:38:32.731 --> 01:38:36.240
I think you can apply this to a lot of stuff.
Let's take negotiation.
Right.

1548
01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:40.050
You get negotiation with somebody.
Yeah.
If you're saying I want to win this deal,

1549
01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:42.360
I want him to steal.
I want it.
You're at a position of weakness.

1550
01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:46.140
So even in business you can't have the position of I want to live,

1551
01:38:46.141 --> 01:38:48.090
I want to live,
I want to buy,
I want to score this deal.
Yeah.

1552
01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:50.490
What about I want to make,
I want to get this deal done.
Like No.

1553
01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.960
If you're actually negotiating,

1554
01:38:51.961 --> 01:38:55.830
you need to be able to walk away from the deal and say,
no,
we're done.
I'm out.

1555
01:38:55.950 --> 01:39:00.830
Strangely they say the same thing about picking up girls.
Same thing.
Yes.
Okay.

1556
01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:05.190
If you're all,
I hope I get this girl,
I'll get this girl.

1557
01:39:05.191 --> 01:39:08.680
That girl doesn't want to be with a guidance to us.
Brutus Rick,
Dude.
Yeah.

1558
01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.530
The amplification here says ain't answer to the question.

1559
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:14.010
What do Samurai worry about?

1560
01:39:14.011 --> 01:39:17.850
The answer is having the desire to extend their own life is something worth

1561
01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:18.684
regretting.

1562
01:39:19.150 --> 01:39:19.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1563
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.300
<v 0>Samurai who value their own lives are not worth a farthing.
Yeah.</v>

1564
01:39:24.301 --> 01:39:27.870
So we've got,
that's,

1565
01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:30.600
I think you need to be able to set aside

1566
01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:33.403
<v 2>that</v>

1567
01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:40.580
<v 0>well,
I think it applies to everything.
I think so,
yeah.
If you're so concerned,</v>

1568
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:45.600
like in Jujitsu,
totally concerned about winning and,
and not tapping out.
Yeah.

1569
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:49.400
You're not going to learn.
Yeah.
And,
and even worse,
you're not going to compete.

1570
01:39:49.401 --> 01:39:51.080
You're not even gonna roll with not to do well.
Yeah.

1571
01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.820
And he still apprehensive and,
yeah.
Yeah.
I had a place a lot for sure.

1572
01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:57.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1573
01:39:57.770 --> 01:40:01.550
<v 0>Here's a good one.
It is important to understand</v>

1574
01:40:03.250 --> 01:40:04.070
<v 2>that</v>

1575
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:09.070
<v 0>should the mirror in a Samurai's heartbeat unclouded than the opponent will be</v>

1576
01:40:09.681 --> 01:40:13.400
clearly reflected in it.
Good.

1577
01:40:13.401 --> 01:40:15.860
One amplification.

1578
01:40:15.861 --> 01:40:20.861
Any Samurai whose will is from can be described as having a mind that is

1579
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:26.990
unclouded.
So if your will is from,
think about that,
if your will is from,

1580
01:40:28.130 --> 01:40:32.150
you can be described as having a mind that is unclouded in such a state,

1581
01:40:32.210 --> 01:40:36.260
the strength or weakness of the opponent will be perfectly reflected.

1582
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:37.583
<v 2>Hm</v>

1583
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:46.950
<v 0>Next Samurai cast off thoughts of both life and death.</v>

1584
01:40:47.710 --> 01:40:50.290
Their mind is set on moving forward.

1585
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:53.440
Amplification.
Samurai,

1586
01:40:53.441 --> 01:40:56.890
do not dwell even for a moment on whether they live or die.

1587
01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:01.510
Fulfilling Their Mission Requires Samurai to advance.

1588
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:05.710
It is what they do best,
what they were made for.

1589
01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:12.640
Yeah,
that is.
I think that that one breaks down to

1590
01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:18.460
being able to clear your mind on what happened the last go round.
Right?

1591
01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:20.150
Not worried about the future,
not worried about the,

1592
01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:23.260
like when you're doing something like if you're competing,

1593
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:25.330
you make a mistake.

1594
01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:28.490
You have to put that out of your brain completely and you need to,
okay,

1595
01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.820
that mistake happened or you did something great.

1596
01:41:30.850 --> 01:41:33.040
You can't jump up and down and be all happy about that.

1597
01:41:33.090 --> 01:41:36.610
You need to just clear your mind and keep the mind empty.

1598
01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:42.310
You can't get freaked out about the next shot or the last shot.

1599
01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.360
We learned that in shooting like this is something that you see all the time

1600
01:41:46.361 --> 01:41:50.200
when we're shooting,
we do little.
Basically when you're shooting in the teams,

1601
01:41:50.201 --> 01:41:53.080
everything is a competition and you'd see a guy,

1602
01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:55.600
you're shooting head plates and they'd have six head plates in a row,

1603
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:59.010
which is the steel plate about the size of a hit and you got to shoot him an,

1604
01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:01.460
and when you shoot it,
you instantly know if you hit a risk cause it goes ping,

1605
01:42:01.461 --> 01:42:02.710
Ping,
Ping,
Ping,
Ping.

1606
01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.860
And if you see a guy that can't put the last one out of their head,

1607
01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:14.760
you know it's Ping,

1608
01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:22.480
Ping,
Ping,
Ping,
mag change.

1609
01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:27.700
It's,
it's bad guy.
That's really good.
He'll miss and just,

1610
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.350
he'll dismiss and he doesn't even think about it.
You're here,
you hear pink,
pink,

1611
01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:36.940
pink,
pink dipping,
dipping.
You just,
no,
no factor.

1612
01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:37.650
Yeah,

1613
01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:40.450
<v 4>it's,
it is the proverbial choking,
you know,</v>

1614
01:42:40.451 --> 01:42:43.930
like she'll get the like why is this guy choking at the end when he's killing it

1615
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:48.110
<v 0>before you can train your mind to do that.
You can train your mind to do that.</v>

1616
01:42:48.111 --> 01:42:50.930
So where you're just,
and actually when I be shooting a lot,

1617
01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:55.010
I could get to that point and then if I'm not shooting a bunch,

1618
01:42:55.011 --> 01:42:57.500
I would lose that pink.

1619
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:03.620
Get frustrated.
Yeah,
you're shooting regularly.
You get that,

1620
01:43:03.621 --> 01:43:06.320
you get past that and the older you get and the more you do it,

1621
01:43:06.321 --> 01:43:07.940
the more you can just say,
nope,
don't care.

1622
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:12.910
<v 4>You know what a phrase would,
would the would always work with me when someone,</v>

1623
01:43:12.911 --> 01:43:15.610
like if you had a coach or something where,
you know,

1624
01:43:15.611 --> 01:43:18.700
in football and you'd have this where like you,
you'd be winning the whole game,

1625
01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:22.270
you know?
And in the fourth quarter it's like,
oh my God,

1626
01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:23.740
we just run out the clock or I don't,

1627
01:43:23.741 --> 01:43:26.800
you have that feeling and guys that choke a lot of time and that's not to

1628
01:43:26.801 --> 01:43:29.440
mention the other team is thinking the exact opposite.
We've got nothing to lose.

1629
01:43:29.441 --> 01:43:31.210
We're going to hit them.
We're going to take risks,
we're going to do all that,

1630
01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:36.250
you know,
so that's why guys can win or teams can win at the last minute,

1631
01:43:36.251 --> 01:43:39.430
even though they've been getting their ass kicked old little game.
Um,

1632
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:41.350
fights kind of like that too.
But I don't know,

1633
01:43:41.351 --> 01:43:44.530
fighters seem to have like more of a will on enough for some reason.

1634
01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.380
But either way.
Either way.
I Dunno.
Um,
but the,

1635
01:43:47.381 --> 01:43:50.950
the phrase I would always help me as if someone would just put it in my sit,

1636
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:52.190
say finish strong,

1637
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.130
<v 3>just finish strong,
finish strong.
But like,
yeah,
it's almost like the,</v>

1638
01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:56.960
or they'll say punch it through or something,
you know,

1639
01:43:56.961 --> 01:44:01.820
something like that that indicates don't let up at the end mentally,
you know,

1640
01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:02.511
just go,

1641
01:44:02.511 --> 01:44:06.470
just keep pushing the way you put that is a little bit different then getting

1642
01:44:06.471 --> 01:44:09.590
distracted by what just happened.
Yeah.
But because they say,
yeah,

1643
01:44:09.591 --> 01:44:13.670
it is a little bit different.
But in its critical role,
when you played football,

1644
01:44:13.671 --> 01:44:17.600
what was it you were trying to do each play where you weren't your receiver?

1645
01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:20.480
Yeah.
Okay.
So let's say you missed her catch that you should have caught,

1646
01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.290
you had to be able to put that out of your head.
So it,

1647
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:26.480
it's just a mental state where it's like finish strong.

1648
01:44:26.481 --> 01:44:30.140
It's finished strong in your mind,
you know?
So yeah.

1649
01:44:30.141 --> 01:44:33.110
Don't worry about your introduced.
I'd get this all the time,
man.

1650
01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:36.660
When when I'd win a match and then I'd win another one.
You don't to do that,

1651
01:44:36.661 --> 01:44:40.550
you gotta win like Matt just till the file after two matches,

1652
01:44:40.551 --> 01:44:43.170
I just start feeling this pressure.
Like it's almost like one my,

1653
01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:45.590
my two match win streak.
It's about to come to an end.

1654
01:44:45.591 --> 01:44:48.050
It's all like the pressure and then you win one more and then the pressure's

1655
01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.370
even on more is weird.
It's like,
oh I wish I did.
I wish I was done is weird.

1656
01:44:52.371 --> 01:44:56.180
Oh Dog.
But if someone would say something along the lines of finish strong,

1657
01:44:56.181 --> 01:44:59.340
it would just cure the whole thing because you're thinking about all these

1658
01:44:59.341 --> 01:45:03.080
comments mentally throw you off.
I don't know.
The pressure.

1659
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:07.940
Somebody say something to you that would make you freak out even more?
Yeah.

1660
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:11.870
Oh yeah.
If someone said,
oh you got this.

1661
01:45:12.170 --> 01:45:16.880
Or if someone says,
Hey,
at least you made it this far,
would you then back off?

1662
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:20.460
But it's hard when you're dealing with kids.
It would,
it would,
you know,
like,

1663
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:23.060
like I got kids,
you got kids too.

1664
01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.420
But you know when you got kids that are doing something competitive.
Yeah.

1665
01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:30.300
Like Jujitsu or wrestling and let's say they're winning and,

1666
01:45:30.330 --> 01:45:34.910
and you could tell them,
hey,
you've done good so far.
Go out there and have fun.

1667
01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:38.750
Which is cool.
Yeah.
Or You could say,
hey,
you need to focus more now,

1668
01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:41.020
but because these people are going to be getting tougher.
Yeah.

1669
01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.610
Both of those to me would throw me off.

1670
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:46.720
Cause when you say just relaxed,

1671
01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:49.730
you've made it this far that tells them that it's okay to not to beat,

1672
01:45:49.731 --> 01:45:50.950
to checkout,
you know.

1673
01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.450
So it depends on what their state of mind is to go into that,

1674
01:45:53.451 --> 01:45:55.620
that comment or to go into the situation where he said,

1675
01:45:55.630 --> 01:46:00.440
it's almost to the time I feel like I want to tell people either people I'm

1676
01:46:00.441 --> 01:46:04.820
coaching,
well no I shouldn't say that when I want to tell my kids,
relax,

1677
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:07.090
go out there,
have fun.
Go out there and have a good time.
Yeah.

1678
01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:10.910
Because I think that is easier on their brains and to what your point was

1679
01:46:10.911 --> 01:46:14.920
earlier,
when people let loose and they,

1680
01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:19.400
they don't feel the pressure,
they tend to perform better at her.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1681
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:20.750
I agree with that fully.

1682
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:26.320
But if it's like if that's like kind of the underlying attitude like relax,

1683
01:46:26.481 --> 01:46:29.690
have fun regardless of what Matt First Match,
last finals match,
whatever,

1684
01:46:29.691 --> 01:46:33.660
then yes,
I think so.
But if it's like come on you,
you got this,
we'll do,

1685
01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:34.520
you can do this,
you can do this.

1686
01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:37.400
And then right when he gets to the final then you say,
okay,

1687
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:39.980
yeah you made it this far.
So it's bad.

1688
01:46:40.610 --> 01:46:42.560
I think he can be bad depending on how they take it,

1689
01:46:42.561 --> 01:46:45.510
but if they take it like I wouldn't say relax.
Yeah.

1690
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:48.950
I said go out there and have I go go out there and do what you do.
I say that a,

1691
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.650
okay,
so if you say you made it this far MMA fights and be like,
Hey,

1692
01:46:52.651 --> 01:46:57.150
do what you do.
That's good to say.
If someone told me that,
go do what you do,

1693
01:46:57.151 --> 01:46:59.640
that would really be his guardian and go do what you do.
Yeah.

1694
01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:01.900
That's good stuff to say to me.
The,

1695
01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:07.350
but anything to put pressure on me.
Like if you do this,
you win.
Like,
you know,

1696
01:47:07.351 --> 01:47:09.270
like one more match and that's it.
No,

1697
01:47:09.271 --> 01:47:11.520
don't want to say what's interesting like with coaching MMA,

1698
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
if you'd get a guy in a,
get it into a guy's head,

1699
01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:19.230
do not get taken down and they'd go in there that you'd be really hard to take

1700
01:47:19.231 --> 01:47:21.630
that person down.
Yeah.
And when you'd say,
Hey,

1701
01:47:21.631 --> 01:47:24.480
as soon if you get taken down as soon before you even get on the ground,

1702
01:47:24.481 --> 01:47:25.650
you getting back up.
Yeah.

1703
01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:29.190
You get that people with that mindset going and it'd be really hard for someone

1704
01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:31.590
to take him down and hold no,
cause he's been panicking.
Yeah.

1705
01:47:31.591 --> 01:47:33.720
He'd be basically paying them get,
you know.
Yeah.

1706
01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:36.190
<v 0>So interesting.</v>

1707
01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:41.560
Here's a good one.
And this is actually the last one.

1708
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:43.680
Fittingly hmm.

1709
01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:49.660
Not engaging in any form of study will cause your mind to wander.

1710
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:55.150
This route will result in your spirit becoming unfocused.

1711
01:47:57.230 --> 01:47:57.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1712
01:47:57.810 --> 01:48:01.890
<v 0>Then the amplification,
there is nothing wrong with daydreaming,</v>

1713
01:48:02.190 --> 01:48:02.971
but if you study,

1714
01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:07.260
your spirit will become focused on edge shape to deal with a certain thing.

1715
01:48:08.490 --> 01:48:12.090
That shape will then become lost.
In turn,

1716
01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:16.950
there was a song that goes,
the drifting and becoming lost is what the mind does.

1717
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:18.360
It becomes your spirit,

1718
01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:23.910
the mind of your spirit do not allow your mind to do this.

1719
01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.430
And Yeah,
I think that that's,

1720
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:36.080
<v 3>that's something that we actually talk about all the time.
In fact,</v>

1721
01:48:36.081 --> 01:48:36.920
that may be the one

1722
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:41.960
<v 0>very purpose of me doing everything that we do,</v>

1723
01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:46.620
which is,
you know,
studying and learning.

1724
01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.420
And to go back to the question that,
that Eric,

1725
01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:54.090
the translator posed to me,
Ken,

1726
01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:57.810
any of the rules in this book apply to modern warfare.

1727
01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.830
As I said,
not only do they apply to modern warfare,
they apply to life.

1728
01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:05.400
And the thing is there's nothing new here.

1729
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:06.623
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1730
01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:12.050
<v 0>Right?
Just like an arm lock.
There's nothing really new here,</v>

1731
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:16.610
but that doesn't mean that there's nothing really new here.

1732
01:49:16.611 --> 01:49:21.350
There's always something new.
We'd sure we've heard these lessons before,

1733
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:25.870
right?
We've heard them from Dick winters.
We've heard them from Bob Hoffman,

1734
01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:29.240
we forward them from general patent in Hackworth and we heard them from wooden

1735
01:49:29.241 --> 01:49:30.074
leg.

1736
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:32.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1737
01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:36.570
<v 0>And I said this on the first podcast that we did,</v>

1738
01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.440
the first podcast that we did.
I said,

1739
01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:45.890
you know what to do,
do you know,

1740
01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.650
to be balanced

1741
01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:49.331
<v 3>and you know,</v>

1742
01:49:49.331 --> 01:49:53.020
to work out and you know not to be gluttonous with food and you know you

1743
01:49:53.021 --> 01:49:58.021
shouldn't sleep late and you know you should keep things clean and organized and

1744
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:03.760
you know that your struggles now will be rewarded in the future.

1745
01:50:03.761 --> 01:50:06.160
So you must endure,

1746
01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:14.440
endure,
endure the hardship,
endured the suffering,

1747
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:17.290
endure the pain of discipline,

1748
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:25.450
endure the pain of discipline is that in the future you could have the reward

1749
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.410
and we know what that reward is.
The reward for discipline

1750
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:36.970
<v 5>is freedom.
Good.</v>

1751
01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:41.540
I think that is all I've got for tonight.

1752
01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.590
So
Echo,

1753
01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:53.040
<v 3>speaking of rewards and freedom and trying to get better,</v>

1754
01:50:56.260 --> 01:51:01.210
do you have any suggestions on maybe some ways to get better for people,

1755
01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:06.940
ways that might also at the same time simultaneously support this podcast if

1756
01:51:07.481 --> 01:51:11.500
people want it.
Sure.
Do something like that.
Do you want to also,

1757
01:51:11.590 --> 01:51:16.420
I think it is important and beneficial to add that you know,

1758
01:51:16.421 --> 01:51:20.860
when you endure the suffering pain,
that's metaphors for the most part.

1759
01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:24.130
Sometimes it's a real pain and suffering real,
real,

1760
01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:29.290
but you do that enough and you get used to it.

1761
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:33.370
And to the point where you kind of like require it in a way like you kind of

1762
01:51:33.371 --> 01:51:37.700
want to like,
you know how I used to go on like um,

1763
01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:38.470
you know,

1764
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:43.470
like a strict diet in I'd be hungry a lot but at the same time the Diet would be

1765
01:51:45.581 --> 01:51:47.530
really effective with a good workout program.

1766
01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:50.440
And then so when I go off the program you kind of,
you know,

1767
01:51:50.441 --> 01:51:53.320
you feel kind of almost like,
for lack of a better term,
it's like toxic.

1768
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:57.970
Like hold on just a sec,
you know?
Yeah.
You almost,

1769
01:51:58.030 --> 01:52:00.490
I kind of miss that hunger in the,
you know,

1770
01:52:00.491 --> 01:52:04.000
the cause you kind of associate the hunger that you always have with like being

1771
01:52:04.001 --> 01:52:07.270
in good shape and perform for you.
It kind of like,

1772
01:52:07.271 --> 01:52:11.740
that's an example of like how it can be,
you know,
you don't like eating a lot.

1773
01:52:11.741 --> 01:52:15.340
I Dunno.
It's weird.
You don't even have to amplify it.
Yes,
let's do it.
Yeah.

1774
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:17.260
Like when you're on the program.
Yeah.

1775
01:52:17.261 --> 01:52:20.290
It kind of feels good that you're on the program.
You're suffering for sure.

1776
01:52:20.291 --> 01:52:23.320
There's some quote unquote suffering there,
but it feels good.

1777
01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:27.970
And especially when you do eat almost 40 when you think about the opposite of

1778
01:52:27.971 --> 01:52:32.350
that,
which is when you're off the program yes.
And you feel like crap.

1779
01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:35.440
Yeah.
Any [inaudible] and yeah.

1780
01:52:35.441 --> 01:52:37.510
What do you do to make yourself feel better?

1781
01:52:37.511 --> 01:52:40.840
What do you do instead of going on the program?
Yeah.
You said you go to the,

1782
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:44.380
you go to the sleeve Oreos.
Yeah,
exactly right.
The answer.
Yeah.

1783
01:52:44.381 --> 01:52:47.580
Cause that's like that's wrong answer.
Yeah.
That's the,

1784
01:52:47.610 --> 01:52:50.610
that's the instant gratification.
Yeah.
Right.
It's weird.

1785
01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:55.190
Opposite of struggling.
Now you're,
you're,

1786
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:58.640
you're not enduring.
Now you're not facing the pain of discipline.

1787
01:52:58.641 --> 01:53:02.450
Now you're looking for a short term rewards.
So that's why,

1788
01:53:02.451 --> 01:53:05.690
that's why I said I said it in the book.
I said in the book,
the field manual,

1789
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:08.510
right?
Like when you're on the path,
it's,

1790
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:13.260
it's easier to stay on the path and when you fall off the path,
man,
yeah.

1791
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:16.760
People,
people just get,
they go to the downward spiral.
Yeah.

1792
01:53:16.761 --> 01:53:19.380
It's like you fall for the trick.
And those I mentioned,

1793
01:53:19.381 --> 01:53:23.590
this says it trick your mind.
You like that you're getting it is fans.

1794
01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:26.910
And you know,
when you,
uh,
you fall off the patty,

1795
01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:31.310
you saying when you feel like crap because you're off the program and the fact

1796
01:53:31.311 --> 01:53:34.970
that you're off the program aside from just your physical physicality,

1797
01:53:34.971 --> 01:53:37.490
you feel like crap.
So you've got to alleviate that feeling.

1798
01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:39.980
So you go to something that's going to give you pleasure,
pleasure,

1799
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:44.380
pleasure you in short term when you needed longterm,
you know,

1800
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:46.460
so that's what you do.
That is a good,

1801
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:51.550
a good thing I do that when let's say I don't feel I've been traveling,

1802
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:53.150
been eating crap,

1803
01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:58.580
the way to get back on the way to feel good again.
It's just to hit yourself.

1804
01:53:58.581 --> 01:54:03.350
I mean,
get some,
it's true.
Get some,
do good Catholic.
A good couple base.

1805
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:06.460
Like,
uh,
you know,
in the,
in the field manual,

1806
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:11.470
I've got these various workouts and there's some of those in there that are just

1807
01:54:12.171 --> 01:54:16.480
core,
not core as an abs cause we call it gut,

1808
01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:20.510
but it's core programs that are fundamental.
Yeah.

1809
01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:24.650
And I kind of know where I'm at on them and even if I'm not going to go in there

1810
01:54:24.651 --> 01:54:29.210
and do a record performance,
it'll put me back on track.

1811
01:54:29.211 --> 01:54:30.110
It'll make,
it'll,

1812
01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:34.940
it'll clean my system mentally and physically.

1813
01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:40.540
And that's good.
Probably.
I used to do this thing where,
um,
you know,

1814
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:44.970
if your girlfriend you get in a fight or something like that or they break up

1815
01:54:44.971 --> 01:54:46.400
with you,
whatever,
whatever,
you know,

1816
01:54:46.401 --> 01:54:48.980
something that makes you in a bad mood for whatever reason.

1817
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:53.830
They used to go to the gym and do eat like shoulders or chest workout,

1818
01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:57.530
something that would give like a really,
really hard painful pump.
You know,

1819
01:54:57.531 --> 01:55:00.080
that kind of like,
I dunno,
12,
15 reps,

1820
01:55:00.110 --> 01:55:02.660
like a minute in between do like eight sets of those,

1821
01:55:02.730 --> 01:55:06.500
like massively pumped for some reason I just feel way better.

1822
01:55:06.501 --> 01:55:09.950
It's the same thing.
That's what I'm talking about.
The way,

1823
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:13.820
if you can give yourself for me,
you got your,

1824
01:55:13.821 --> 01:55:16.690
you got some workouts that are just fundamental.
I don't know what,
Oh,

1825
01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.610
there's their [inaudible] name for like medicine.
They have medicine,

1826
01:55:19.670 --> 01:55:22.370
new medicine,
some medicine workouts.

1827
01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.000
You got to have some of those medicine workouts that just puts you back on the

1828
01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.620
back of a path.
Oh yeah.

1829
01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:32.270
And then you know what do fast to 24 hours that's bolted.

1830
01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:37.790
Do 24 hours.
You feel you feel good?
I'm telling you.
Feel good.

1831
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:42.290
Yeah.
I'll do like 15 now actually.
Pretty often too.
And you're right,

1832
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:47.100
strangely right?
Yeah.
I just read another article.

1833
01:55:49.670 --> 01:55:52.470
I read two articles cause people,
people tweet them to me.

1834
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:56.460
One of them was about the intermittent fasting.
We gas what?
It's good for you.

1835
01:55:56.690 --> 01:55:57.523
Yeah.

1836
01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.600
And then the other one was about this whole depletion of will is all not true.

1837
01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.040
Yeah.
We'll the the lie.
I was right.
The scientists were wrong.
They were saying,

1838
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:12.210
I think with what you're saying,
I think there's like,
no,
no,
no.

1839
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:14.770
So just saying it's straight up wrong with,
there's no,
no,
no.
There's,

1840
01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:19.820
I just read an article today that it's wrong that this idea of the depletion of

1841
01:56:20.401 --> 01:56:25.110
w,
you know,
if you,
if you have to resist this chocolate chip cookie,

1842
01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:29.610
then within in 20 minutes you won't be able to resist the cake because you just

1843
01:56:29.611 --> 01:56:32.260
can't resist that much.
It's a lie.
It's an in there.

1844
01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:35.730
There's proving now that it is not true.
Not True.
Yeah.

1845
01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:40.290
I feel like that's a psychological state.
So it might vary from individual,

1846
01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:42.060
but what I'm saying is if you,

1847
01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:46.530
if you're on the program and you had some medicine in the morning,

1848
01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:51.770
I'm telling you that it's easier to hold the line.
The more you hold the line,

1849
01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:55.990
it easier it is to hold the line.
That's the truth.
That's the truth.
You know,

1850
01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:02.070
get some speaking a hold of the holding the line and the truth.
By the way,

1851
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:07.560
Chuck West some supplements,
John

1852
01:57:07.670 --> 01:57:12.400
<v 4>goes up limits Krill oil,
the main one and joint or Fairsail,
joint warfare,</v>

1853
01:57:12.401 --> 01:57:13.840
glucosamine and conjoin

1854
01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.790
<v 3>and Curcumin,
which is the other.
There's,</v>

1855
01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:22.750
it's not just glucosomine and can Jordan,
yeah,

1856
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:26.770
this cure curcumin and yes.
What is that?
It's more good

1857
01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:28.090
<v 4>for the joints.</v>

1858
01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:33.430
Some stuff to wage or fair against joint inflammation.
Pain,

1859
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:37.660
degeneration.
Yeah.
And that's a big deal because again,

1860
01:57:37.661 --> 01:57:40.780
I'm going to say I said it before but I think this is critical.
I mean man,

1861
01:57:40.810 --> 01:57:41.081
you know,

1862
01:57:41.081 --> 01:57:45.070
I'm sure there's like supplements that will help you build your muscles if

1863
01:57:45.071 --> 01:57:47.170
you're into building.
I'm sure there is.

1864
01:57:47.530 --> 01:57:52.330
But really if you can maintain your joints,

1865
01:57:53.410 --> 01:57:56.740
especially if your Jujitsu pushing weights,
any kind of like,

1866
01:57:58.210 --> 01:58:02.590
so I like dynamic movement.
Yeah.
You know,
cause your joints take those,

1867
01:58:02.670 --> 01:58:06.000
that that brought and they degenerate over time.
Oh they do cause that.

1868
01:58:06.001 --> 01:58:08.800
What's happening to you?
It's not over here.
Not for generating.

1869
01:58:08.801 --> 01:58:12.880
I'm on joint warfare.
If you're straight up generating,
huh?
Yeah,
no,
no I dig it.

1870
01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:17.240
And the,
this is one of the Krill oil thing.
I'm all,

1871
01:58:17.260 --> 01:58:21.070
I'm not embarrassed cause it's kind of a funny story at my expense in a little

1872
01:58:21.071 --> 01:58:22.090
bit.
It's not funny.
Funny,

1873
01:58:22.091 --> 01:58:26.470
but it is that I was looking for Krill oil to my father in law.

1874
01:58:26.690 --> 01:58:31.330
I know the truth.
Yeah.
I'm like over here pushing Krill oil like in life.
I mean,

1875
01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:33.820
you know,
um,
Brian,
his name is Brian.

1876
01:58:33.821 --> 01:58:37.630
Remember we went to the retreat in Maine or Brian,
the black belt.

1877
01:58:37.631 --> 01:58:42.370
They came New Hampshire guys.
Um,
so I kind of keep contact with him.

1878
01:58:42.371 --> 01:58:43.900
He's like,
he's like,
Hey,
do you have any,

1879
01:58:43.901 --> 01:58:46.100
like what's the cool supplement or whatever.
I was like,
Bruh,
you know,

1880
01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:49.650
and I sent him some,
some of mine,
I didn't get the report back to,

1881
01:58:49.651 --> 01:58:53.360
I was like the other day.
But nonetheless in life I'm straight up pushing it.

1882
01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:56.440
Tell Greg about it all the time.
I don't think,
I don't think here.

1883
01:58:56.530 --> 01:58:59.140
Maybe I gave him some,
I dunno,
but it's like,

1884
01:58:59.141 --> 01:59:01.660
you know the can you get benefits for something and then you're like pushing it

1885
01:59:01.661 --> 01:59:05.740
on other people.
Some people do it with a brick grudgingly.

1886
01:59:09.130 --> 01:59:13.510
Sure.
Just various things.
You know,
books,
music.

1887
01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:17.350
Why don't we do that with music?
Like if you don't like my,
you know,

1888
01:59:17.351 --> 01:59:20.230
like I'll be like,
hey,
listen to this song.
It's the best song.

1889
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:23.530
And then like you don't like getting it and I'm actually mad at you or you're

1890
01:59:23.531 --> 01:59:25.180
mad at me cause you don't like it.
Why is that?

1891
01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:27.850
Cause I just don't like your music.
I know.
Bravo.

1892
01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:30.520
I think we kind of equate it to our identity in a way.

1893
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:34.060
It's kind of what I do with Krill oil.
It's part of my identity now.

1894
01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:37.360
It's a part of my joints identity.
I can tell you that.
And joint warfare.

1895
01:59:38.590 --> 01:59:43.550
Good ones.
Also await.
I didn't tell you where you can get this.

1896
01:59:43.551 --> 01:59:48.440
Joint warfare and super supercrew or [inaudible] dot com click on the top.

1897
01:59:48.441 --> 01:59:50.480
Does labs.
Actually it's on the front page too.

1898
01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:53.930
It's on Jocko store too by the way.
Jocko store.com but yeah,

1899
01:59:53.931 --> 01:59:56.330
that's where you can get it if you want it,
if you want it.

1900
01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:01.960
A lot of people have been asking for subscription like oh recurring.

1901
02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:04.970
You just can get it every month.
That's what it should be.

1902
02:00:05.090 --> 02:00:07.040
I know because we'll get it set up.

1903
02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:11.690
Yeah cause he gives it into the last three pills.
Even six.
He'd take the three,

1904
02:00:11.691 --> 02:00:15.560
like they only have three left and I got to take this tomorrow after tomorrow,

1905
02:00:15.590 --> 02:00:18.920
you know,
two day shipping and unless you've got to overnight shipping situation.

1906
02:00:19.170 --> 02:00:22.520
Yeah,
there's,
there's,
you don't want to do that to yourself.
I know.
You don't,

1907
02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:26.090
you actually,
for real though that going on.
Yes.
Good idea.

1908
02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.260
Thank you John and Pete also,

1909
02:00:30.530 --> 02:00:31.960
there's some good keys on there.

1910
02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:37.670
Jack was Ziggy Tacos a rash guard.
We'll start with that.
American hands.

1911
02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:39.530
I've worn it many times.

1912
02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:44.840
Can I talk about 19% improvement in performance?

1913
02:00:47.290 --> 02:00:52.210
I got tapped out by nd.
So,
so far no got tapped out by youtube.

1914
02:00:53.650 --> 02:00:57.360
Maybe
different than normal.
Right?

1915
02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:02.260
I couldn't resist 19 I'm just saying the jury's still out.

1916
02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:06.850
I can't come from really?
Yeah,
but,
but if you remember,

1917
02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.590
cause you were,
you remember I was wearing one of our rash guards.

1918
02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:17.470
It's more action.
Bigger.
Yeah.
And uh,
I kinda got God after the right.

1919
02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:18.533
And

1920
02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:24.670
so really in theory you're 19 plus and my knee 19 plus kind of canceled itself

1921
02:01:24.671 --> 02:01:25.600
out really.

1922
02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:30.660
But I felt like maybe if you got 19 I felt like that day I had like 2020 1%.

1923
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:32.140
26 yeah.

1924
02:01:32.410 --> 02:01:36.940
You were bringing it like 26 because you weren't typically don't wear that.

1925
02:01:36.941 --> 02:01:41.930
Right.
You don't really wear rash,
you weren't happy on the final guillotine?

1926
02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:47.320
No.
I think it was a cobra.
And you literally said,
I saw that calming.
Yeah.

1927
02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.440
And that was one of those comments that was meant to kind of deflate my victory,

1928
02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:56.691
you know,

1929
02:01:56.691 --> 02:02:01.580
like you saw coming and it was so obvious and it was just like I just got lucky

1930
02:02:01.581 --> 02:02:04.790
and blah blah blah.
And I just,
I just said,
yeah,
definitely.

1931
02:02:04.791 --> 02:02:08.810
I'm just really telegraphed that one.
I can't believe how pathetic it was.

1932
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:11.750
You want me to give you a breakdown of if you're guilty,

1933
02:02:11.751 --> 02:02:16.190
you're guilty team Cobra,
which I think is even more so than the guillotine.

1934
02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:21.080
Like you have such a good way to like get it and you're one of those guys that

1935
02:02:21.081 --> 02:02:22.790
like,
you're probably walking like right now,

1936
02:02:22.791 --> 02:02:25.040
you're thinking about guillotine right now.
That's what I think.

1937
02:02:25.041 --> 02:02:28.820
That's what it feels like a lot.
It's like when you go for it,

1938
02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:32.460
it just lands perfectly.
It's not the kind where,
you know,
um,

1939
02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:35.620
not,
yep.
No adjustments.

1940
02:02:35.621 --> 02:02:38.720
So it's gotten to the point over literally like what,

1941
02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:41.780
like almost a decade of training with you.

1942
02:02:42.110 --> 02:02:46.580
And that thing getting sunk in that efficiently on my own net almost wants it.

1943
02:02:46.581 --> 02:02:50.690
Then
you're not that far from the truth.

1944
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:54.410
It's like my body like notes like,
Hey,
we've been here before.

1945
02:02:54.411 --> 02:02:55.910
This is what my brain is almost like.

1946
02:02:55.911 --> 02:03:00.260
I can feel my brain as a separate entity tells my body sometimes if I get you in

1947
02:03:00.261 --> 02:03:04.100
a guillotine that you go crazy trying to defend it and then like,

1948
02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:08.570
and you'll get out in the next one I'll be like,
yeah,
he's going down.

1949
02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:11.410
It's like man,
I don't want that beef again cause what?
What I,

1950
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:14.780
what I had to do to get out of that first one is like bro I can't do

1951
02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:17.780
it.
It's not worth it.

1952
02:03:17.781 --> 02:03:21.830
That's exactly what it is and I think that's how my whole body reacts when I

1953
02:03:21.831 --> 02:03:24.950
feel it gets sunk in.
It was kind,
Kinda calm man.
This again,

1954
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:27.890
we've been down this road,
same outcome,
you know,

1955
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:30.980
my body's used to that outcome so it just kind of accommodates it.

1956
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:34.880
That's what it feels like and I think that's part of what I meant by it's like

1957
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:38.150
think your body is okay with me getting here.
I think so too.

1958
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:41.540
I don't like the fact that it's like Jack

1959
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.670
I think,

1960
02:03:43.670 --> 02:03:48.670
I think talking about it might help or it might straight up not rash guards gies

1961
02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:54.460
made in America,
which is awesome,
so that's awesome.
Yeah,

1962
02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:57.650
everyone should know that and they make them like make them make them,

1963
02:03:58.250 --> 02:04:02.000
they don't like shipping some stuff and then,
hey guys,
okay,

1964
02:04:02.001 --> 02:04:04.640
are we starting to make,
yeah.
Even though it's been,
you know,

1965
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:08.690
yeah they make or make up from the thread and the gave the keys.

1966
02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:11.600
I think he's good videos coming out.

1967
02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:15.560
Is that what the words mean?
Video Megan,

1968
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:21.290
Megan confused with,
with Amanda by the way.

1969
02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:24.380
Whole long story.
I won't go into it right now.
Nonetheless,

1970
02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:27.170
videos out making mid the video.

1971
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:29.900
It's a good one actually.

1972
02:04:29.901 --> 02:04:34.310
You kind of made the video to understand it didn't make anything.
Nonetheless,

1973
02:04:35.250 --> 02:04:38.970
a jock who's gives out other geese on origin.
All good.

1974
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:43.500
I got two other ones,
so three or a gin gies altogether me.

1975
02:04:44.090 --> 02:04:45.990
That's the only Gisele everywhere.
I think.

1976
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:51.150
Unless someone else can make the own their own material in America and you know,

1977
02:04:51.151 --> 02:04:54.600
provide the same everything,
then hey,
maybe,
maybe not.

1978
02:04:54.601 --> 02:04:57.450
But just saying has it right now.
That's how it is.
Also

1979
02:05:00.010 --> 02:05:03.690
kettlebells.
I know I'm going to keep you updated on my kettle bells situation.

1980
02:05:03.691 --> 02:05:07.200
I'm addicted.
I'm addicted to them collecting and doing them.

1981
02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:12.240
So I got one more that the cyclops from on it.
The designer one?

1982
02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:16.410
No,
no.
Uh,
what do you call it?
The regulation regular ones and none of those.

1983
02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:21.180
Anyway,
cyclops I think is 40 something pounds.
I only got one.

1984
02:05:21.181 --> 02:05:26.130
I'm getting out of jail at that one too.
Anyway,
the good thing about these is

1985
02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:31.830
they are balanced because a lot of times,
and from what I hear,
I don't know,

1986
02:05:31.831 --> 02:05:35.010
but from what I hear,
like a lot of the designer ones,
they're not balanced.

1987
02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:38.380
So what I'm saying anyway,
these are balanced and that's the one,

1988
02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:43.460
the ones I use and I'm addicted to the workout starts slow with these.

1989
02:05:43.951 --> 02:05:47.170
And when you do it though,
are you still doing a lot of kettle bells?
Yeah,

1990
02:05:47.250 --> 02:05:48.600
I do decent amount of kettle bells.

1991
02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:52.350
I was doing some Turkish get ups the other day.
Yeah,
but I didn't get that.

1992
02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:55.140
I thought it was going to get really into Turkish get ups,

1993
02:05:56.370 --> 02:05:59.160
but I did it a few times and just it didn't,
it didn't stick.

1994
02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:01.620
You know what I mean?
You know how to understand stuff just sticks.

1995
02:06:01.621 --> 02:06:04.170
Even though it was cool.
Oh,
you know what it was?

1996
02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:08.370
I did it with the 35 pound one than I did with a 54 pound one and I was like,

1997
02:06:08.371 --> 02:06:10.380
Dang,
this is a good exercise.
Hard.

1998
02:06:10.381 --> 02:06:13.620
And then I went online to look up exercises in the news ones with guys doing it

1999
02:06:13.621 --> 02:06:17.460
with 185 pounds,
like doing it and made it.
Maybe I just got discouraged.

2000
02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:20.790
I got encouraged when I see that.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Huh?

2001
02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.550
You take it as like a challenge.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2002
02:06:23.630 --> 02:06:27.440
Me and my whole outlook is different anyway.
When you do these kettlebells,

2003
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:31.530
if you want the cool ones,
to me,
kettlebells are dope,

2004
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:35.910
but if you want an extra dope you go to on it.com/jocko get your kettle bells

2005
02:06:35.911 --> 02:06:40.100
are there.
Just look at them.
They got light.
One's heavy ones.

2006
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:44.490
I say start light,
but hey,
whatever your level is,
you know,
get them.

2007
02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:49.810
Also when you get your copy of what is the,

2008
02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:54.720
the the translated hundred rules of war.
Yes.

2009
02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:59.160
Yeah.
Which I'm pronouncing wrong.
Sorry.
Yeah,

2010
02:06:59.310 --> 02:07:03.600
see and that's really Eric and okay,
so I put these books,
all these books,

2011
02:07:03.601 --> 02:07:07.320
if you didn't already say it again.
I put all of the books on our website,
Jocko,

2012
02:07:07.321 --> 02:07:11.490
podcast.com and this is for this very reason Jocko doesn't know how to pronounce

2013
02:07:11.491 --> 02:07:14.400
some of this stuff.
No,
especially the Japanese stuff.
You know,

2014
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:18.780
he comes to me for help.
I help.
It's not smooth processes.

2015
02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:21.840
What I'm saying.
So I tried to smooth it out a little bit.
Jocko,

2016
02:07:21.841 --> 02:07:26.370
podcast.com on the top says books from the episodes.
Click on there.
Look,

2017
02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:31.260
this is episode 101 boom from episode one on one,
the a hundred rules of war,

2018
02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.400
even though there's only 97 okay.
If you want to get some other book,

2019
02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:39.120
you can still click through.
Yeah.

2020
02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:45.180
And support the podcast mean if you buy a book that is completely off of what we

2021
02:07:46.301 --> 02:07:50.770
would normally talk about.
Like what?
I don't know.

2022
02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:55.990
Something that's not about war.
The Lion,
the witch and the wardrobe.
Yeah.

2023
02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:59.410
If you go to buy that book,
yeah,
you can just click.

2024
02:07:59.411 --> 02:08:02.020
It still supports the puzzle supports and a half to be the but,

2025
02:08:02.021 --> 02:08:04.900
but when you buy it,
yeah.
Just click.
Anyone's cannot bind a book.

2026
02:08:04.901 --> 02:08:09.100
Even if you're buying Delta clubs,
golf clubs,
duct tape,
Longmore,

2027
02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:15.990
grocery bag holders.
Hmm.
Even though I don't recommend that stuff,

2028
02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:20.220
it'd be carry grocery bags.
You carry them with your hands.
Both hands.

2029
02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:23.520
All of them too,
by the way.
Anyway.
Yeah.
Click through there.

2030
02:08:23.550 --> 02:08:26.520
So on a website joke about yes.
Dot.
Tom.
Good way to support.

2031
02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:31.350
Also subscribe to the podcast.
If you haven't already on iTunes,
stitcher,

2032
02:08:31.351 --> 02:08:32.220
Google play,

2033
02:08:34.230 --> 02:08:38.460
Spotify is that I don't use Spotify.
Spotify is not,
you can't get,

2034
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:39.870
well I don't think you can get it,

2035
02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:41.910
but there's a bunch of any podcasting platform.

2036
02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:43.530
I don't think Spotify is one of them.

2037
02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:46.980
We had requests for Spotify cause then you could play it on Alexa,

2038
02:08:47.550 --> 02:08:52.350
but I can play it on our an Alexa right now you can say Alexa play the latest

2039
02:08:52.351 --> 02:08:57.060
Jocko podcast actually in not to split hairs but it's called Amazon Echo.

2040
02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:01.000
Alexa is just the name you say.
Yeah but Alexis is what you're saying.
Yeah.

2041
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:04.620
So that's what I said.
No,
you said you can get it on Alexa.

2042
02:09:04.710 --> 02:09:06.770
Oh looks like technique.
The difference.

2043
02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:12.540
I just want us to go in correct and did sane and doing the right thing.

2044
02:09:12.570 --> 02:09:17.310
That's all.
Nonetheless subscribe if you haven't already is.

2045
02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:19.170
It's so put it this way.
I'm not saying subscribe.

2046
02:09:19.171 --> 02:09:23.640
I'm saying subscribing is a good way to support also on youtube.

2047
02:09:23.641 --> 02:09:26.850
Subscribe to the Youtube Channel.
Put some videos on there.
Excerpts,

2048
02:09:27.090 --> 02:09:30.990
not as many excerpts as I did last week this week cause it got,

2049
02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:34.650
I learned this new video thing that we we talked about earlier.

2050
02:09:34.651 --> 02:09:38.850
I won't go into it,
but
it's pretty technical.

2051
02:09:39.330 --> 02:09:43.800
But I wound up getting like obsessed with it.
So like for,

2052
02:09:43.801 --> 02:09:47.190
I think he was like 11 hours a day for three days.
I'm making this clip.

2053
02:09:47.191 --> 02:09:49.530
That's like three seconds long learning.

2054
02:09:49.710 --> 02:09:53.580
So I didn't get to the excerpts is what I'm saying.
But as a result,

2055
02:09:53.581 --> 02:09:54.630
I think there's,

2056
02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:58.410
I think the next video that it releases going to have some new things to,

2057
02:09:58.411 --> 02:10:01.890
it might be something that only I'm noticing.
Maybe,
maybe not.

2058
02:10:01.891 --> 02:10:05.190
But nonetheless that's going to be,
oh it is.
Either way.

2059
02:10:06.030 --> 02:10:09.270
The point there is subscribe to Youtube.
It's a good way to support,

2060
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:13.703
<v 2>yeah.</v>

2061
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:18.590
<v 4>I want to do a youtube live.
Figure out how to do that.
Yeah.
It's not that hard.</v>

2062
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:20.540
So let's just see youtube

2063
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:24.860
like a Facebook live and youtube.
Yeah.

2064
02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:28.820
Cause I think it'd be cool to be stored on youtube instead of store on Facebook.

2065
02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:32.570
Right?
Yeah.
I think it's just a matter of he gets,
it doesn't matter.

2066
02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:36.650
Ultimately it's just a video.
Yeah.
But if it's a,
if it's stored on,

2067
02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:40.940
on Youtube,
people can go back and be reading it and whatever.

2068
02:10:40.941 --> 02:10:43.610
And I just started watching it.
If it's on Facebook,

2069
02:10:43.611 --> 02:10:48.560
it's way buried in some random your feet.
Yeah.
What do you call it?
Yeah,
yeah,

2070
02:10:48.561 --> 02:10:51.770
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Timeline,
whatever.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2071
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:54.110
Maybe I'll talk to Zachs on that one

2072
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:59.750
nonetheless.
Youtube does a good one to subscribe.

2073
02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:02.780
Got some other videos aside from just the video version of this podcast.

2074
02:11:02.810 --> 02:11:06.740
That's the good,
that's the main reason I think to subscribe.

2075
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:09.050
If you're interested in that kind of stuff and you can say,
you know,

2076
02:11:09.051 --> 02:11:13.280
you can get a notification if you're,
you don't need it,
but you can get one.
Also,

2077
02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:18.200
Jack was a store.
It's called Jocko store chocolate store.com.

2078
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:20.600
Got some new stuff on there.
Straight up

2079
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:22.623
<v 2>rash guards.</v>

2080
02:11:23.690 --> 02:11:27.290
<v 4>Hoodies are up.
I know I've been saying it but they're up though,</v>

2081
02:11:27.291 --> 02:11:29.960
is what I'm saying.
It's got some hats.

2082
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:33.980
I am putting beanies on there.
Oh yes.

2083
02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:39.320
That's good.
I hope your thick beanies there.
Uh,
I don't know.
Regular.

2084
02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:43.630
I didn't know there was.
No,
I've been doing some research.

2085
02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:48.110
This is a good beanie.
Okay.
From all,
I kind of extrapolated all the,
you know,

2086
02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:51.170
the advice on online and these are the good ones.

2087
02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:55.490
I'm also some new rash guards.
K,
the new rash guard is

2088
02:11:57.770 --> 02:12:02.360
a rash guard that says small action on one side.
Big reaction on the other side.

2089
02:12:02.930 --> 02:12:05.990
When I worked for the first time,
uh,
keeling,

2090
02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:12.140
Taylor [inaudible] said he'd eat it.
No,
he didn't know the layers,

2091
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:16.760
but he saw it and he was like the essence of Jujitsu and I was like,
oh,

2092
02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:20.180
because it is right.
Small action beak reactions,
what we're hoping for you.

2093
02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:24.830
Interesting.
Queuing judo.
Kiwi.
Yeah.
He knew.
He knows about the way.

2094
02:12:26.450 --> 02:12:29.870
Also a less,
some women's stuff on there,
which is cool.

2095
02:12:29.930 --> 02:12:34.580
I think some patches on their shirts.
I'm going to have a new shirt coming out.

2096
02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:37.820
I don't,
I don't have an issue.
You have a new show coming out?

2097
02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:41.270
Do I know what it is?
Nope.
Oh,
interesting.
Not yet.

2098
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:45.260
A lot of times I'll get input from the online people,

2099
02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:47.890
from the people and I kind of,
you know,

2100
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:51.070
most of the time it's like one off things,
you know,
like who I heard chuck,

2101
02:12:51.071 --> 02:12:52.160
let's say this one thing,

2102
02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:56.060
this one time back then I really liked it and we would make a great shirt kind

2103
02:12:56.061 --> 02:12:59.390
of thing.
And um,
although they're usually write,
a lot of times I'm thinking,
hmm,

2104
02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:02.770
maybe that might not translate into real picky and choosy as,

2105
02:13:02.771 --> 02:13:06.770
or what I'm hearing.
Yeah.
Put it this way.
A lot of people have to hit me with it.

2106
02:13:07.210 --> 02:13:10.010
And this was one of those,
hmm.
I've actually mentioned it before.

2107
02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:15.200
It's called back to the book.
Oh,
I think it's coming out.
Anyway,

2108
02:13:15.201 --> 02:13:18.740
that one's coming out too.
Jacobus store,
Jocko,
store.com

2109
02:13:20.630 --> 02:13:23.360
take a look at this stuff on there.
If you see something you like,
get something.

2110
02:13:24.110 --> 02:13:27.650
Also psychological warfare on all of our,

2111
02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:30.230
this is what psychological refers on all of our

2112
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.560
<v 3>journeys.
I'm going back to attorneys.</v>

2113
02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:38.490
Someone requested something the other day and it was actually better than

2114
02:13:38.491 --> 02:13:41.310
campaign or journey,
but I forget what it was.
Dang.

2115
02:13:41.311 --> 02:13:43.560
So it's better just not that much better.
No,
it was better,

2116
02:13:43.561 --> 02:13:46.470
but I can't remember it.
I see a lot of stuff to the street.

2117
02:13:46.471 --> 02:13:51.360
You do see a lot of stuff well,
on our campaign against weakness journey,

2118
02:13:52.110 --> 02:13:55.590
every once in a while we'll run into roadblocks,
points of weakness,

2119
02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:59.850
hopefully less than more.
More Times than not.
We don't.

2120
02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:03.060
We know what you're trying to see.
What I'm saying,
not very clearly.

2121
02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:06.760
Hopefully not very often,
but one,
the

2122
02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:13.280
infrequent time comes where you run into those weaknesses on infrequent time,

2123
02:14:13.651 --> 02:14:18.270
but it's cool.
I know.
We know what you mean bro.
The nut frequent.
Yeah.

2124
02:14:18.271 --> 02:14:23.271
The rare time that you run into weaknesses do not worry because psychological

2125
02:14:23.821 --> 02:14:26.490
warfare is an album with tracks that helps you right through that.

2126
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:31.650
Most situations,
pretty much all situations really waking up early,

2127
02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:36.120
skipping workouts,
procrastination,
staying on the program,
Diet.

2128
02:14:36.121 --> 02:14:37.650
Why is all this stuff?
A lot of stuff,

2129
02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:41.490
a bunch of tracks on there and it's Jocko telling you pragmatically ways that

2130
02:14:41.491 --> 02:14:44.670
you can practice practical,
right?

2131
02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:48.210
Practical meaning you can practice these things.

2132
02:14:48.211 --> 02:14:52.950
It's not just some philosophical slash inspirational stuff,
it's to say do,

2133
02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:57.630
yeah,
it's more do practical,
just kind of the team word for it,

2134
02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:03.060
but nonetheless practical advice coming directly from Jocko of directly into

2135
02:15:03.061 --> 02:15:07.050
your ear on why you shouldn't give in to these weaknesses.

2136
02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:08.730
It's like a little spot in your campaign.

2137
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.160
That's what psychological warfare is so good on.

2138
02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:16.460
It's a real good on [inaudible] number one spoken word albums on iTunes for

2139
02:15:16.921 --> 02:15:21.120
about nine months and it finally got beaten out by another album called

2140
02:15:21.121 --> 02:15:25.320
discipline equals freedom field manual,
which is people keep asking me,

2141
02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:30.380
it's available as an album with tracks on iTunes,

2142
02:15:30.391 --> 02:15:33.660
Amazon music,
Google play and other MP three platforms.

2143
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:36.480
Also on Amazon you can get Jocko white tea.

2144
02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:40.500
What's good about Jocko white tea is if you drink Jocko white tea,

2145
02:15:40.590 --> 02:15:45.030
you are guaranteed 100% to be able to deadlift 8,000 pounds.

2146
02:15:45.031 --> 02:15:49.880
Minimum minimum.
Yeah,
I don't care.
What's your body weight?
One 25 cool.

2147
02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:54.960
8,000 pound dead lift,
so the guarantee like that,
we're looking pretty good.

2148
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:59.460
Try it out.
There's some books where the warrior kid,

2149
02:16:00.030 --> 02:16:02.850
by the way just finished where the word kid book number two,

2150
02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:05.660
what the whole thing or at the draft the draft.

2151
02:16:05.670 --> 02:16:09.360
I mean there's gonna be some edits.
Yeah,
the story is a story is completely done.

2152
02:16:09.570 --> 02:16:12.370
It's a good story.
I uh,

2153
02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:17.420
my nephew read it and he said it's better than the first one that's saying a lot

2154
02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:21.470
because normally the second one left me a little message and you know what as a

2155
02:16:21.471 --> 02:16:25.770
message said,
hey uncle Jocko,
that's what it said.
And he's,
he's in fifth grade.

2156
02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:29.980
So it's a pretty accurate assessment.
We're assuming from him he

2157
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:30.843
<v 0>study.</v>

2158
02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.120
But the book number one is outright now and it is the book that you wish you had

2159
02:16:36.491 --> 02:16:39.400
when you were a kid.
I wish I had it when I was a kid.
It didn't have it.

2160
02:16:39.610 --> 02:16:43.300
No one had,
hadn't written it yet.
No.
Hadn't learned the lessons.

2161
02:16:44.410 --> 02:16:47.620
So if you want to give a kid a better life,

2162
02:16:48.850 --> 02:16:52.120
get in this book also extreme ownership.
Check it out.

2163
02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:56.950
New Edition is coming out.
Matter of fact,
let me rephrase that.

2164
02:16:57.250 --> 02:16:59.560
New Edition is out.

2165
02:17:01.590 --> 02:17:04.420
It is available right now.

2166
02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:08.320
It has a new forward where we talk about kind of what we've seen since the book

2167
02:17:08.321 --> 02:17:12.570
came out.
It has color pictures in it.
Ooh,

2168
02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:16.060
new color pictures.
It has echoes name in it.

2169
02:17:16.450 --> 02:17:18.790
Why is it that goes naming it echoes name and his,
isn't it?

2170
02:17:18.791 --> 02:17:22.810
Because we took Q and a from the podcast about leadership

2171
02:17:24.490 --> 02:17:29.050
and put the really important questions and answers in there so you can refer

2172
02:17:29.051 --> 02:17:34.051
back to them without having to go through 101 podcast and find the one question

2173
02:17:36.131 --> 02:17:38.950
that you want to get.
No,
now you can find it in the book also.

2174
02:17:38.980 --> 02:17:42.490
It's got a new cover on it,
which is black more cool.

2175
02:17:43.630 --> 02:17:48.130
And you know,
because the Q and a is from you,

2176
02:17:48.190 --> 02:17:53.190
I kind of need to thank everyone because this book is not just life in me

2177
02:17:54.191 --> 02:17:54.730
anymore.

2178
02:17:54.730 --> 02:17:59.730
Now it's Lafe and me and echo and everyone that asks questions and uh,

2179
02:18:00.970 --> 02:18:02.830
help with the podcast by asking questions.

2180
02:18:02.831 --> 02:18:07.420
So thanks to you all for the new version of our new book.

2181
02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:14.140
Also,
the discipline equals freedom field manual is now available worldwide.

2182
02:18:16.090 --> 02:18:19.660
And if you've got questions,
this book has answers.

2183
02:18:19.690 --> 02:18:22.060
If you're wondering what workout should I do?

2184
02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:26.530
What martial arts should I train in?
How do I know what a good Jujitsu gym is?

2185
02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:28.570
What should I eat?
What should I do when I'm injured?

2186
02:18:28.571 --> 02:18:30.640
What should I do if I don't feel like working out?
What should I do?

2187
02:18:30.641 --> 02:18:32.590
Something bad happens.
How should I overcome failure?

2188
02:18:32.591 --> 02:18:35.350
If you've got those kinds of questions,
this book has the answers.

2189
02:18:36.550 --> 02:18:38.830
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

2190
02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:42.880
Get it for yourself and get it for anyone else that might want answers to these

2191
02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:46.630
questions.
The book is not normal.
It's not normal.

2192
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:51.370
I know it's not normal cause you know why I'm not normal.

2193
02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:57.070
No,
the book is,
it's black and the book,

2194
02:18:57.130 --> 02:19:00.190
it only has a black cover.
It has black pages as well,

2195
02:19:00.550 --> 02:19:04.060
so some people don't like that.
And you know what I said,

2196
02:19:04.810 --> 02:19:08.500
don't read it.
If you don't,
if you don't want him to read that,
cool.

2197
02:19:08.501 --> 02:19:11.080
Don't read it.
And as I said,

2198
02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:16.090
if you want to get the book on audio,
it is not on audible.

2199
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:20.650
It is on MP3 as an album with tracks.
You can get it through iTunes,

2200
02:19:20.651 --> 02:19:21.700
Amazon music and Google play.

2201
02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:25.780
That way you can listen to it as an album with tracks.

2202
02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:28.250
This is a book that you don't sit there,
it's not a story.

2203
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:31.070
It's not a story.

2204
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:35.420
You might want to listen to one section of it at a different time.

2205
02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:37.250
You might be saying,
Hey,

2206
02:19:37.251 --> 02:19:41.930
I need to listen to a section about destroy your mode,

2207
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:44.030
right?
How do I get into destroy your mode?

2208
02:19:44.031 --> 02:19:47.390
One day you might want to read about the fear of failure or he listened to with

2209
02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:50.570
the fear of failure.
One day you might need to hear sugarcoated lies.

2210
02:19:50.571 --> 02:19:52.880
One day you might want to hear about the war path,

2211
02:19:52.881 --> 02:19:55.130
so he knew when you have it as an album with tracks,

2212
02:19:55.610 --> 02:19:57.740
you can listen to it in whatever order you want.

2213
02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:02.860
You can set it as your alarm and you can put it in your play list,

2214
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:07.280
that kind of thing,
which you can't do with a lame audible book.

2215
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:09.643
So that's that.

2216
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:13.670
Also if you like the leadership principles that we talk about on this podcast

2217
02:20:13.671 --> 02:20:16.730
and you want to get them for your team or business that we have a leadership and

2218
02:20:16.731 --> 02:20:18.320
management consulting company.

2219
02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:23.150
It's the premier leadership and management consulting company.
Did I say that?

2220
02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:27.950
Yes,
I did.
Echelon Front me,

2221
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:30.320
Lafe j p Dave Burke.

2222
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:36.170
If you want us to come and work with your company and get your leadership
aligned

2223
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:41.750
and get your leadership into destroy your mode,
