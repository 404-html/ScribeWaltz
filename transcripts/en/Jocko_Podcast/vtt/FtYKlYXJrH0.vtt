This is Jocko podcast number one 57 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.980
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.540
I was in a seal platoon serving as the assistant platoon commander in the late

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.240
nineties.
Note that means yes,
no war going on.
That's what it means.

5
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.860
So we were training,

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.600
we were training hard and this platoon that I was in at the time,

7
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.090
we were going through urban training,

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.480
urban combat training and we are pretty far along in the training and we were

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.850
starting to get our,
our simunition,

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.300
which is like fake bullets are simunition in paintball wars on force,

11
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.970
on force training.
And we were doing um,

12
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.210
like multiday operations.
So almost like a scenario,

13
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:58.520
like you've got a full scenario going on.
Like there's bad guys in the city.
No,

14
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.430
it's the concrete city,

15
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:04.431
the fake city with concrete buildings that are pretty much just the shells of

16
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:09.501
buildings and we're going against op for seals.

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.590
We call them all up for that stands for opposing force.

18
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.970
So the opposing force there,

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.730
other seals who are role players pretending to be bad guys.

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.310
They know our tactics,
they know our techniques,
they know our procedures.

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.620
And on this particular day they had captured one of our seals from our platoon,

22
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.750
the bad guys,
the role players.

23
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.720
Was that part of the scenario or just a made it part of the scenario.

24
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.910
So whatever they did they'd cause confusion.
They cause mayhem.

25
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.720
They end up with one of our guys just on their own though.

26
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.660
That wasn't part of the overall training?
Well it is.
You know,

27
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.060
when I was running training we always did that too.

28
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.720
So it's just a long standing kind of hey if you can capture one of the seals,

29
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.590
it's like never leave a man behind.
Let's get him to leave a man.
It's captured.

30
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.570
So at this point,
like I said,
they had,

31
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.200
they had captured and I don't remember exactly,

32
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.710
but they'd captured 100 guys and they had him in a building and it was a big,

33
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:02.550
a pretty big building,

34
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:07.230
like a pretty big but rectangular type building.

35
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.640
Five stories maybe.
Maybe it was four stories.
But anyways,
they had them,

36
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.210
they didn't have an a top floor,
but they had him in like the,

37
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
the floor below the top floor.
So he's the one on the third floor,

38
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:22.140
the fourth floor,
I forget.
But they have the guy in there,

39
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.190
and remember this is not,
there's no power in the city and it's,

40
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:28.800
the city is out in the middle of nowhere.
It's a fake city.

41
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.540
So you can hear everything right?
Kind of being pretty much here.
What's going on.

42
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.800
So they have our guy and they're like torturing him,
mock torturing him.

43
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.920
And of course they're up there.
Tell them like scream,
scream louder.

44
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.030
And he's yelling and yet you know that they're feeding him what to yell to try

45
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.860
and get us all riled up there.
There he's screaming,

46
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:51.030
they're going to kill me,

47
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.850
they're going to violate me screaming.
So they're having a good time with it.

48
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.760
And so our standard operating procedures was like,
Oh,
you know what?
Okay,

49
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.020
so there's a building needs to be cleared.

50
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.540
We go and we cleared the whole building.
We start on the ground floor.
We,
Claire,

51
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.430
every room that we call up to the next where we clear every room,

52
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:08.470
you go up to the next one.
And that means that there's not going to,

53
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.680
any bad guys that get get into your train,

54
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.310
there's not going to be any bad guys in between your force,

55
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.340
which can cause a blue on blue.
So when you're gonna clear every room,
let me,

56
00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:21.610
you're gonna move down these hallways and you're gonna go from the bottom and

57
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.080
the top.
And that's just kind of the plan,
right?
Sort of normal.
And

58
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.470
like I said,
we,
we knew where they were,
so we immediately,
okay,

59
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.650
we had called the plant,
we have Craig could be their safe,
our guy,

60
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.420
we're all fired up.
And as we were,
we're doing this,
you know,
the,

61
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.090
the standard plan come up.
Like,
okay,

62
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.170
we'll go in this east door and we'll just clear the first floor.

63
00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:43.780
And the second one,
when we get to know,

64
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.450
and as I'm sitting there kind of listening to this,

65
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.640
I s I just said,
hey,
no,
let's do this instead.

66
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.840
Let's just sneak up to the building because you can get to the building behind

67
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:58.360
other buildings.
You could find a little sneaky way to get there.
I'm like,

68
00:03:58.361 --> 00:03:59.920
let's sneak him in the dead space.

69
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.700
Dead space is areas where the enemy can't see you or where you can't see the

70
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:08.350
enemy.
It's just areas where there's no v line of sight.
I said,
let's,
let's go.

71
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.770
And there was an external stairs,
like a fire escape on the outside of Warner.

72
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.340
I said,
let's go straight to the,
to the floor.
He's on,

73
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.640
won't clear any of the other floors but won't clear any of the rooms.

74
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.730
We'll just go right in the home,
go,
go directly to where he's at.

75
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.390
And that was the plan.
So we did it.
And um,

76
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.000
yeah,
and the thing was,
it was a,
it was,
we weren't,
that was kind of a new idea,

77
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.550
right?
Like,
Hey,
let's do this.
I'm not,
I know,
I believe me.

78
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.190
I'm not saying I'm the first guy that ever thought is,
I'm not,

79
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.100
I'm just saying our mindset at that moment was,
hey,

80
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:43.520
this is what we're being trained to do.
We'll do it.

81
00:04:43.521 --> 00:04:46.670
We're trying to do so for anyone that's listening for any of my team guy

82
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:49.120
brothers that are like,
you didn't think,
I'm not saying I thought of it.

83
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.420
I'm saying at that moment in time we were focused on doing it one way and I said

84
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.010
Hell let's do something a little bit different.

85
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.100
And then once I said it everyone's like yeah,

86
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:00.550
yeah cause there was like everyone knew that was the right answer.
Right.

87
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.460
But you can just had to have that different look at it for a moment.

88
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.170
And so we did it.
We went to the extra mile stare when we went up really quiet.

89
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:09.700
Those,
the other thing we were like,
we're not going to say,

90
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.661
cause you know you're in a room,

91
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:13.090
you call it clear and you say next room and all this other stuff.

92
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.240
We weren't going to say anything.
We're just going to stay quiet.

93
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:17.800
So we went all the way up the stairs really quietly.

94
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:21.510
We walk in and we can hear him,
hear him yelling out the window like coma,

95
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.200
you better get him quick and all this stuff.

96
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:28.201
And then we go into the room cause silently and shoot all the op four in the

97
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:32.800
back.
We killed them all and we saved her hostage.
And there was one,

98
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.600
there was one seal cadre who we gave the,

99
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.230
and I'm not going to have his actual nickname,

100
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:43.231
but his nickname was along the lines of Simmie GME because simunition was with

101
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.620
simulation of what we used and semi Jimmy was really good at being a bad guy and

102
00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:54.300
so,
and he would laugh at us,
you know,

103
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.270
we'd be moving through a building and you could hear him like if he shot you in

104
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:03.230
the neck and he'd be aiming for your neck or your nuts,

105
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.130
like he was going to get a good time with it and that's what you want.
You know,

106
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:08.780
you want your guys guard so send me Jimmy we,

107
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.130
but we got this moment with semi Jim.
He shot him in the back and they,
you know,

108
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:13.921
they were stoked,
you know,

109
00:06:13.921 --> 00:06:16.160
they could see even though they want to win and they want to beat us,

110
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:20.700
but there's still stoked.
He wasn't cackling.
He was,
you know,
he was stoked on it.

111
00:06:20.701 --> 00:06:23.300
And so they died.
We say we've got,
so my point in this is that

112
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.150
sometimes you have to do things that the enemy is not going to expect,

113
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:32.750
that people aren't gonna expect that your competitors not going to expect the

114
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:33.920
hard part about doing that.

115
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.470
It isn't actually doing the thing that they don't expect.
Right.

116
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.440
It's cause like I said other,
this is not what I,
what I said to do wasn't this,

117
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.330
you know,
miraculous Eureka moment of tactical genius.

118
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.330
It wasn't that this was anyone that would have taken a step back would have said

119
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.950
like that's a good call.
Let's do that instead.

120
00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:00.170
But we were all wrapped up in that situation.

121
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.210
And so you want to learn how to do that.
You want to learn how to,
and again,

122
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:09.170
it's about detaching,
but a couple things that'll help you with that.

123
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.360
One is don't be the person that's planning everything.
Don't be the person.

124
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.210
And it's hard,
especially we talked about extreme ownership like,

125
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.420
and everyone wants to be a leader and they want to step up.

126
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.600
Don't try not to be the guy that comes up with every plan.

127
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.490
Literally try not to be that guy.

128
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.710
Now are there times when you're alone member where you want to like step up and

129
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:31.311
come with a plan?
Yeah.

130
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:33.590
I'm talking about when you're in an actual leadership position,

131
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.750
when you're a junior and you're,

132
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.900
you're trying to learn and you're trying to bring forth ideas.
Yeah man,

133
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:39.950
come up with some plans.
You know,

134
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.430
shoot that idea up cause you're throwing out good ideas that are going to get

135
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:44.300
bounced off the boss.

136
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.030
But when you're the guy that's in charge of trying not to be the guy that plans

137
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:48.950
everything,
try not to be the guy that makes every single call,

138
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.200
let the subordinate's plan or let the superiors plan.

139
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.030
Let other people come up with plans.
Now are there situations where like there's,

140
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.180
you've got to make calls.
Of course there are,
there's a dichotomy,
right?

141
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.490
But in that particular situation I didn't feel the need that I had to be the guy

142
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:08.480
that came up with a plan.
Like,
let other people do that and you know,

143
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:12.530
if someone else had come up with the,
come up with that standard plan and it was,

144
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:15.290
and I hadn't like detached,
I would've been like,
okay,
cool.

145
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.330
That's what we're doing,
where we're going forward.
You know?
But you,

146
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.980
you have to allow other people to come up with plans.

147
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:26.350
And the other thing is recognize that the,

148
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.770
the way that you know of doing something might not fit.

149
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.560
You might not know everything.
It's,

150
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.580
it's a good thing to always think to yourself.
You might not know everything,

151
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:38.451
right?

152
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:43.190
That's a good idea to have in your mind or is that what I know might not work.

153
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:47.150
That's something else.
What I know might not work.

154
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.280
That's another really smart thing to constantly replay in your head.

155
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.950
They what I know might not work.
Then you know,

156
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.350
so that that means you got to have an open mind then.

157
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.330
Then you've got to remember of course that rules.

158
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.410
Sometimes you have to break rules.

159
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.660
<v 1>Okay?</v>

160
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.990
<v 0>You have to be very judicious when you decide you're going to break rules.</v>

161
00:09:07.991 --> 00:09:12.991
And there's some principals that that you cannot violate without massive,

162
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.010
<v 1>okay</v>

163
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.720
<v 0>reason without a massively heavy reason and a way to mitigate the risks of</v>

164
00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:24.950
breaking whatever those fundamentals are like cover,
move,
like their cover move.

165
00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:27.740
You should never violate cover move ever

166
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.230
except for when it just makes sense that you need to violate it.
So that,

167
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:37.290
and that story right there are kind of leads into the first question of Q and a,

168
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.540
which we haven't had Q and a Q and a in a while.

169
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.600
And the first question is,
uh,

170
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.090
we'll go ahead.
First question,
first question you raise,

171
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.250
you recently said Hackworth was a rule follower most of his career,

172
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.180
but in about face the book,

173
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.140
he always talks about how he went against his commanders rules.

174
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.260
How do you play the game but also act like Hackworth?
Yeah.

175
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:09.261
And so this is a classic example of the dichotomy leadership with regard to

176
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:11.490
obeying rules and,

177
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:15.390
and Hackworth absolutely obeyed the rules and he'll bathe them to the,

178
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.140
to the extreme.
Sometimes if you remember in the book,
He,

179
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.203
he,

180
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.410
he worked in situations where he,

181
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:27.350
they were like the strict dissed.

182
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.070
<v 0>In garrison.
So like not in combat,
just in gears and he would,</v>

184
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.390
everything's perfect uniform.

185
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.740
If you remember when General Mooky Amo was on and we talked to,

186
00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:40.450
we talked to him about meeting hack for the first time and you know,

187
00:10:40.451 --> 00:10:42.290
it's kind of like,
what was he like?
And he was like,
oh,

188
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:45.860
he was high and tight haircut,
totally square to wait.

189
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.920
That's following the rules to win Ti.

190
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.530
And the other thing that he played,
he definitely played the,
played the game.
Hmm.

191
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.630
Hackworth played the game he developed with,
he developed relationships with,

192
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.590
with people that were senior to him,
people that were influential.

193
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.350
Sla Marshall who he went on tour with,

194
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:08.150
if you remember through Vietnam and Sla Marshall,

195
00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:11.480
he didn't really even respect but SLA Marshall had such big influence that he

196
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:13.940
said,
hey,
you know what,
how can it become Bros with this guy?

197
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:19.690
He played the game because Marshall had influence and he even took some hits,

198
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.500
you know,
took a little frag for,
for,
for SLA Marshall.

199
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.380
But at the same time,

200
00:11:30.381 --> 00:11:32.330
if it's troops weren't getting the right treatment that he needed,

201
00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:34.040
he would do what he needed to do.

202
00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:36.650
He would break rules to take care of them if he had to.

203
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.920
And at the same time he would follow the rules to a t if you remember when he

204
00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:43.360
took over the battalion in Vietnam,

205
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.200
the hopeless and wanted to turn them into the hardcore,

206
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.640
he brought all their crap into the middle of the thing and said,

207
00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:51.460
we're going to fly it out of here.
No more radios,
no more guitars,

208
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:52.630
none of this other stuff and getting it out.

209
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.430
So that's following the rules to a t.
But at the same time,

210
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.860
if he needed to like steal food for them or steak,
something to get them,

211
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.770
he would do that stuff.
So he's constantly balancing that economy.

212
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.690
Another thing he did is he,
he took these administrative jobs that he hated

213
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.860
in order to rise through the ranks in order to become,
to get d,

214
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.920
Get places to develop relationships so we could have more influence.

215
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.250
He was assigned to the Pentagon.
He,
he,
in the book,

216
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:27.970
he talks about the Pentagon being working in the Pentagon being a claustrophobic

217
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:31.510
hole,
no more than 20 by 20 feet with 15 other people in it.

218
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.320
And he talks about Isaiah,
you'd say your paper,

219
00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:40.321
your inbox would be filled when you showed up and you'd immediately,

220
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.300
the phone would be ringing.
He'd be talking to people all over the world via,

221
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:46.510
if all the people in Vietnam,
they're calling you or their their time zone.

222
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.360
And so he didn't like this job,

223
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.960
but guess what got the highest possible evaluations when he left.
Why?

224
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:57.850
Because he played the game
and he built these relationships with,

225
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.010
with all these kernels and all these generals and all these people that had

226
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.900
influenced his Glover,

227
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:05.470
Johns and Pearson and countless others by doing what he needed to do.

228
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:09.610
And then when he needed to,
he broke,
he broke the rules.

229
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.750
And sometimes he went a little too far with breaking the rules and

230
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.600
when he,
when he got out,

231
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.050
when they kind of drove him out after he did the big interview where he said,

232
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:24.040
hey,
we're not going to win.

233
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.370
They went and drilled down into his camps and looked at the things that he had

234
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:28.360
going on there,
said,
oh,
you'll yoga,

235
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.160
you're allowing this to happen and you're allowing this to happen.

236
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:35.161
So he left himself a little vulnerable by breaking the rules a little bit too

237
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:37.780
much.
So the a rule to learn from that,

238
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:41.260
it's like don't do things that people can hold over you.
And for me,

239
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.590
the things that people can hold over you are things where you can't stand up and

240
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:50.920
say,
yes,
that's what I did.
Yes,
that's what I did.
Hey,

241
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.510
my guys didn't,
hadn't had a good meal in four weeks.

242
00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.720
They've been in the field for three of those weeks and when they came out,

243
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.770
guess what?
I,

244
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.030
I figured out a way to get some steak and I took it from the rear and I had it

245
00:14:07.031 --> 00:14:11.740
flown up using mill using our helicopters and I had a,
Yup,
that's what I did.

246
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:14.500
And if you want to,
you want to drop the hammer on me for that.
Got It.

247
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.440
Now if you do that,
that's cool,

248
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.530
but there's some things where you break the rules where maybe you wouldn't be

249
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.180
able to stand up tall and proud and say,
this is what I did in his why I did it.

250
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.980
So you want to be careful that you don't do things that will allow people to

251
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:33.820
hold things over your head.
And for me,

252
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:37.450
things that are things like that are things that you can't stand up with your

253
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:39.880
chest out and say,
this is what I did and this is why,
dude,

254
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.410
I know it wasn't within the regulations.
This is what I did.
This is why I do it.

255
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:48.310
And if I get fired because of that.
Understood.
Check.

256
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.320
Now here's where you get a little,
here's where we can,

257
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:58.790
we can
question hack for sure.

258
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.010
Let me ask you this.

259
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.000
If hack would have cause.
Okay.
So he,
he didn't play the game at the end.

260
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:10.370
He didn't play the game.
He went on an interview and said,
hey,

261
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:12.260
we're not going to win the war.
Not the way we're fighting.

262
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:15.710
We're not gonna win the war.
Within a few weeks,
he was driven out of the army.

263
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.210
He didn't play the game at that moment.
Right.
So let me ask you this.

264
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.720
If he would have played the game just a little bit,
just said,
look,

265
00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:28.820
we need to change our strategy if we're,
you know what I mean?

266
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:32.690
If you were to just j and then he would have stayed in and then he would have

267
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.630
perhaps gotten a promotion and got perhaps gotten to a position where he

268
00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:38.090
actually had influence over the way the war was being fought.

269
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.340
If he had done that,

270
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.390
would he have been better off?

271
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.350
Would he have been able to better help the situation?

272
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.450
Because I don't know,
once they drove him out,
it's not like that interview.
Well,

273
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:55.250
I don't know.
We'd have to check the check.

274
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:58.580
The historical sort of results of that interview.

275
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.610
It's certainly started to sway public opinion and maybe that,
you know,

276
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:02.810
maybe in his mind,
hey,

277
00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:06.650
I need to tell everyone what's going on so we can get out of here.
Right.

278
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.450
So maybe,
maybe that was the intention.
Maybe that was the result.

279
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:14.450
Maybe that helped shut down the war eventually,

280
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:19.790
but maybe if he would have played,
continue to play the game,

281
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.040
he could have gotten to a position where he had more even more influence and

282
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:27.200
could change the way the war was being fought.
I don't know.

283
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.020
I'm sure we could have a long debate about that.

284
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.630
But that's as a leader,

285
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.750
something that you are going to have to weigh out all the time.

286
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:43.430
And there are situations where,
uh,
and actually breaking news today,

287
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.850
General Maddis just put in his resignation for being secretary defense.

288
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.400
So is,
that's a,
I'm,

289
00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:54.960
we're going to have to talk about that when I get a little more information on

290
00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:57.110
it.
Is that him saying,
look,
I,

291
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.290
it's going to be better for me to make this statement by leaving or would he

292
00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:08.030
have been better off staying there where he can at least still have a massive

293
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:12.410
amount of influence because he's the secretary of defense will have to drill

294
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:16.280
down on that one.
That's a hmm.
That's a good question.

295
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.330
Both those are good questions.
And the bottom line is,
um,

296
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.870
if you haven't read about face,

297
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.190
read it and learn from a guy named Colonel David Hackworth.

298
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.150
Next question.
Next question.

299
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.030
So the answer to that question was sort of another question,

300
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.510
kind of a question you gotta ask yourself.
Yes.

301
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.310
And that's a question and I've talked about this where if I tell you echo,

302
00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:42.680
hey echo,
I want you to do this mission,
I want you to do it this way.

303
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:45.350
Take your platoon and go do it.
And you disagree with what I'm telling you.

304
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.980
And you just say,
hey boss,
I don't want to do it that way.
And I said,
hey,
you shut

305
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.430
<v 2>up and do what I told you to do.
And you go,
you know what,
you can fire me.</v>

306
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:54.720
But I'm not doing it.
I go,
okay,
fine,

307
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:57.660
you're fired and I get knucklehead over here who's a yes man.

308
00:17:57.661 --> 00:17:59.880
It comes in and I tell them to go to the mission the way I told him to do it and

309
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:01.800
he goes and doesn't get to everyone killed.
Yeah.

310
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.490
Would it have been better off if you said,
okay boss,
I get it.
I,

311
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.360
I'll do it your way,
here's some things I'd really like to not do.
And you go,
no.

312
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:11.700
I said,
no,
shut up.
And then you take your guys,

313
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:13.440
you mitigate everything that you can.
Actually,

314
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:17.880
there's an example of this in band of brothers where major winners is being
told,

315
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:18.091
Hey,

316
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:23.091
send a reconnaissance element across the river again tonight and he doesn't want

317
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:25.890
to do it.
The the war's almost over.

318
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.070
They had taken some casualties I think the night before when they did the same

319
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:32.070
type of operation and he just says,
got it boss.

320
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.620
And then the guys go and they sit in the,
they pretend to go out,

321
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:40.620
but they really just sit in the basement of a building on their side of the

322
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:43.740
river.
And then later on they said,
Yup,
we went,
we came back,

323
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:47.160
we didn't find anything.
Okay,
cool.
There's a perfect example.

324
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.690
Imagine if if major winners,
Dick winters was like,
we're not doing it.

325
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.180
And now you're getting an ego contest with the colonel who was like,

326
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.940
Oh yes you are.
No,
we're not.
Okay,
fine.
You're fired.

327
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.630
Let me get knucklehead over here.
Who's gonna do what I told him to do?

328
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.710
Who's in total?
Yes,
man.
And now we take that risk and guys get killed.
So,

329
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:09.150
so who is it?
Dick winters played the game.

330
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.290
He played the game so he could still have that influence and power and,

331
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.030
and still protect his guys
can get complex.
Yeah.

332
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.130
It's very,
that's why leadership is hard.
It's,

333
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.610
it's weird though because when you say it's complex,

334
00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:27.090
when you say leadership is hard at the same time,
like you,

335
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.380
if you're a principled human being and you have principles and you know what's

336
00:19:31.381 --> 00:19:33.540
right and you're doing the right thing for the right reason,

337
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.700
the decisions are actually usually a little easier,
clearer,
clearer.
Yeah.

338
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:40.500
They might not be easy,
but they're clear.
Like,

339
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:43.800
I know what I'm supposed to do here.
I got it.
I,
I'm,
I'm,
uh,

340
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.390
I'm going to figure this one out.
And this,

341
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.110
this I think applies to most scenarios where

342
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.360
like if you think of the big picture where if you're like,
hey,

343
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.530
I'm going to consider myself after everything's going to be said and done,

344
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.020
you know,
it kind of goes along with what you said.
Like,
oh,

345
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:08.790
can you still understand you?
If you consider,
okay,
look back,

346
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.653
you're going to,

347
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.660
cause there's gonna come a point where you're going to look back on this and

348
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.020
you're going to feel the way you're going to feel right now.
But later on,

349
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:18.480
how are you gonna feel about like how you handled it?

350
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.010
They don't know what decision you made in how you made a thing to tell kids too.

351
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.460
Would you,
if you're,

352
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.960
if you're at a party or you're wherever and something's going on,

353
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.160
would you be proud to stand up and be,
hey,
here's the situation and I,

354
00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:35.280
this is what I did and this is why I did it.
If you can't,

355
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.460
maybe you should really reconsider what your actions are going to be.
No men,

356
00:20:39.461 --> 00:20:43.680
it's because a lot of the times shoots where she was like kid as an adult to a

357
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:47.350
lot of the time it's like they're literally the opposite decision you like,

358
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.010
especially if it's

359
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.600
<v 3>one of those like go along with the crowd kind of scenarios,
you know,</v>

360
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.080
where it's like,
Oh hey,
it's easy to go longer and when you're a kid,

361
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:55.120
especially when it involves drinking and stuff,
sometimes there's,

362
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.000
there's really no consequence.
You know,
whatever.
You did something dumb.

363
00:20:58.001 --> 00:20:59.980
No one gets hurt or dies or nothing like that.

364
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:02.470
But every once in a while there is,
but so it's like,

365
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.490
it makes it harder because you don't like when you go do something,
I don't know.

366
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.470
Dumb.
I don't know.
Go jump off a bridge.
I don't know,

367
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:12.400
something to drink and drive or whatever and no one dies or no one,

368
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:17.050
nothing big happens.
It sort of reinforces that maybe it might be okay,
you know,

369
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:20.010
you maybe be able to slide with this behavior a little bit,
you know,

370
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.350
but at the end of the day,
you know?
Yeah.

371
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:26.620
If you can clearly see that big picture where in the future you're going to be

372
00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:29.740
looking back on how you handled it.
Yeah.
Here's another thing,

373
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:31.030
same concept I used to tell,

374
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:36.090
I told my guys was you just might as well act like CNN is recording what you're

375
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:41.140
doing and it's good,
right?
You want to act like an idiot,

376
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.711
guess what?

377
00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:43.930
It's going to be on scene and because someone's got a camera somewhere around

378
00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:48.310
there and you might as well be saying that today as a kid,
as a teenager,

379
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.060
you might as well be saying,
Yup,
this is,
this is the next viral video.

380
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.530
This is my 15 minutes of fame is going to be me doing whatever I'm doing right

381
00:21:56.531 --> 00:22:01.180
here.
So it's got to watch out for that.
Learn from hack.

382
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.390
Next question.
Doco I struggle with receiving banter from other guys.
Banter.

383
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:07.840
Okay.

384
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.100
I'm naturally a sensitive gut which lends myself to take normal smack talk from

385
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:16.690
other guys personally,
I'm trying to get after it.
I wake up early,
I work out,

386
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:18.220
eat healthy,
work pretty hard,

387
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:23.221
but still seemed out some deep seated insecurities which flare up when guys

388
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:24.400
keeping me stick.

389
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.760
I have some bloody good mates and I want to get to the point where I can take

390
00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:34.870
smack talk for what it is and even give a bit of stick back to the guys.

391
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.930
What can I do to help this?

392
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:44.450
<v 0>Here's one thing that you can try to get into your brain and this is one of</v>

393
00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:51.831
those things that's hard to get into your brain and it's even harder to actually

394
00:22:52.921 --> 00:22:56.580
get it in your brain and functionally use this thought.
Here's the thought.

395
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.870
<v 1>Okay?</v>

396
00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:04.340
<v 0>The more,
okay,
if you're,
if you're paranoid about something,</v>

397
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.290
if you're insecure about something,
the more you let things bother you,

398
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.320
the more insecure you will appear.
Well,

399
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.260
let me say that again.
The more you let things bother you,

400
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.690
the more insecure you are going to appear.

401
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.690
And the worse whatever that thing that you're worried about,

402
00:23:23.691 --> 00:23:25.760
whatever that thing that makes you feel insecure,

403
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.250
the worst it's going to appear to everyone else.

404
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.890
So if you got a big nose and you're embarrassed because you got a big nose,

405
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.400
and every time someone says something about your big nose,

406
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.380
you get mad and you get offended,
that big nose it be close,

407
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:43.490
even bigger.

408
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.480
So think about that.

409
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.870
If there's something that bothers you and you let it be known

410
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.950
and you let it bother you,
divorce,
it's going to get.
And,

411
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.420
and also think about this.
Another thing that will help,

412
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.870
these are things I'm trying to help help,
uh,

413
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.460
sort of smooth the edges of insecurity.
Here's another one.
People,

414
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.530
even though you think even when you think they are,

415
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.600
and it's kind of egotistical to think this,
but we all do it.

416
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.050
People aren't sitting around and thinking about you and your weaknesses.

417
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.820
They're not sitting around and thinking about you and your weaknesses.

418
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.620
They're not like,
that's your ego telling you that.
So

419
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.630
don't sit there and think everyone's looking at your big nose all the time.

420
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:31.790
They don't care.
They've got their other problems.

421
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:34.820
They got their own life going on you.
They don't care about your big nose.

422
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.090
You know what makes them care about it when they know,

423
00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:39.500
if they say something to you,
it bothers you.

424
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.380
That's the first thing you're going to think when they see you again.

425
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.580
Here comes the good time,
some fun.
Now it,
and here's another thing.

426
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:51.560
If you want to kind of mitigate that man,
do what I do it.

427
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.440
Mark doesn't weigh the warrior kid when Uncle Jake says,
hey,

428
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.200
if you're getting made fun off,

429
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.930
he's in in way the word could call them plate face San Marco,

430
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:03.290
you got to route this Guy Nathan James had telemark.
Oh you got a round face,

431
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:04.880
you look like played.
Calls him plate face.

432
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:08.930
That's his insult as insults him all the time and it bothers him cause he's

433
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:12.360
looking in the mirror going right.
I feel I look like a plane.
Let's,

434
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.220
it bothered him and uncle Jake says,
hey,
go,
go make fun of yourself.

435
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.910
And he finally gets a chance.
He does,
uh,
they're,
you know,

436
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.240
a class and they have to do a self portrait and he draws himself as a plate,

437
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.510
a plate face.
And when the kid that's been making fun of it,
sees it,

438
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.640
he laughs and then guess what does make fun of him anymore about it because he

439
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:34.910
realizes it doesn't bother and they kind of bond a little bit and they kind of

440
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:38.870
bonded a little bit actually what he's going for in this question that is,
yeah.

441
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:41.910
Yeah.
So you got them and it's,
it's this,

442
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.910
that's why I said it's hard to do this because when you're insecure about and

443
00:25:44.911 --> 00:25:48.320
your big nose or you're insecure about your big years or whenever,

444
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.210
and you let people know that,

445
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.300
or maybe you just think it's in your brain and you think if you say something,

446
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:55.070
let's get even worse.
It won't get worse.

447
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.340
Might get worse for an uptick for a second.
Right?
It might,

448
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.010
you make fun of yourself,
you know,
people are like,
oh yeah,
that's right.

449
00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:04.730
I didn't notice that you do it.
Then it'll kind of,
no one really cares.

450
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.240
And that's why in the teams and the teams,

451
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.280
you never let anyone know that something bothers you or if they know it bothers

452
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:15.560
you,
you're going to hear about it forever.
That's just going to be how,

453
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.040
that's just,
that's just the way it's going to be.
And what that means,

454
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:23.480
the polar opposite of that or the flip side of that is it's not fun to harass

455
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:27.410
some,
it's not fun to harass someone about something that doesn't bother them.

456
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.410
It's not even fun.
Right.
It's not fun.

457
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.450
Why would you harass someone when they don't get it?

458
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.060
When you don't even get a rise out of him?
He's just not fun.

459
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.120
You just leave that thing.
You look for something else.
Yeah.

460
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.420
So poke a little fun at yourself.

461
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.980
These guys are going to back off because they're bored.

462
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:49.070
<v 2>If you show no reaction and like you said that that kind of self deprecating</v>

463
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:52.650
humor will formed a little bond.
Yeah.
You can uh,

464
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.420
give a little stick back to the guys.

465
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.440
If you start giving stick the guys be ready to take it back though.
Yeah,

466
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.260
they're going to escalate.
Yeah.
That's just so,
I mean,

467
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:05.760
I grew up with two brothers,
one twin brother,

468
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:06.780
and that's like a,

469
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:12.360
like that's literally the foundation of our relationship is just you tease the

470
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:14.910
other guy about some lit,
everything.

471
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.440
Like he can come in with a new shirt on that's a seal platoon.
Yeah.
Like,
oh,

472
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.860
we'll be like,
oh,
you know,
like breath,

473
00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:25.770
not even something to tease somewhere they sell men's shirts where you bought

474
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:28.520
that.
Yeah.
Whenever it's lear that's,

475
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.640
it's so bad to the point where one,
um,
when,

476
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.320
when I got with my current life,
when we were,
when we started dating or whatever,

477
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:40.590
like it's just habit,
you know,
like even you like same thing,
you know,

478
00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:43.020
like you'll,
you'll give me crap,
I'll give you kind of whatever.

479
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.540
But it's so common that I do it to her.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
And you know,

480
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:52.250
at first she's like,
Oh,
what?
Like what,
why are you teasing me so much?
Like your,

481
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.200
cause I knew where even before we were together,
I knew her for gears actually.

482
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.740
And he was like,
Hey,
I kind of annoying,
you know,
he's like teases or whatever.

483
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.200
And I had to like reel it back yourself.
Yeah,
because that,

484
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.900
because that is so,
so much of how guys do it,
you know,

485
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.980
100% right.
And I've told this story before when I got,

486
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:11.791
when I was going to college,

487
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:14.580
I was around team guys all day and I started doing the team guy thing with my

488
00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:17.550
wife and after,
yeah.
She's like,
Hey,

489
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.920
I'm not in the teams so you can be quiet now.
And I was like,
wow,

490
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.410
she's right.
And I didn't even realize it because that's just,
you know,

491
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.580
all day long you show up,

492
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.610
you show up in the platoon space and his verbal sparring.
Yes.

493
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.460
As soon as you walk through the door he's going to say something,

494
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.420
they're going to bring it.
And what's interesting is how he's,
how he's like,

495
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:38.790
I want to get to the point where you know,
he,
he can speak to her with,

496
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:40.860
the thing is,
I would agree with this.

497
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:45.861
I'll probably even hundred 10% which is hard to agree 100% but I feel this way,

498
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.730
it's probably stronger than him.

499
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:51.750
Like you ever been around someone who like you just can't really joke around

500
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:52.950
with like,
I'm not,

501
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:56.130
I'm not the kind guy who all tease someone and try to like to make them,

502
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.950
you know,
especially if,
I don't know I'm good or whatever,
but um,

503
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.220
but if you're around someone who can't really take it,

504
00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:05.370
you can't joke around with them.
It's like,
man,
I don't want that guy to be there,

505
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:08.790
man.
I wish he just wasn't,
you know,
I'm not mad at him,
but I just,

506
00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:11.490
I don't want to hang around with that guy.
You don't want to be that guy.

507
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.240
So even if like,
especially at first,
like let's say,
okay,
I'm,

508
00:29:16.241 --> 00:29:17.250
I'm this guy right here.

509
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.890
The worst is someone that can dish it out but can't take it.

510
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.890
But what do you mean?
Yeah,
that is the worst.
I don't,

511
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.710
the only reason I wouldn't say he's the worst is what's worse than that.

512
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:28.830
If he's dishing it out and he can't take it,
it's kind of,

513
00:29:28.831 --> 00:29:32.040
you get a payoff of teasing the guy.
I'm saying it.

514
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:33.150
Let's say he doesn't do shit up.

515
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.700
Let's say he's just a guy you just can't joke around with.
It's like,
man,

516
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:37.570
you're making me uncomfortable kind of thing,
you know.

517
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.050
But if this guy cause you to your point,
if it's,
yeah,

518
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.200
if it is annoying when people can't take it and you make a joke and they get all

519
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:47.770
fired up and they,
and then they're like actually mad,
right?
Yeah,
that's,

520
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:50.790
that's well that's how you end up with people that aren't really your friends.

521
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.570
That's exactly right.
So yes.
Yes.
So you get there man.

522
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.810
I say get there and at first just,

523
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.550
and you kind of made it really clear to me how,
you know,

524
00:30:01.551 --> 00:30:04.150
when you make a change or something,
it's not going to whoop boom,

525
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:08.410
you're off to the races with the change going full speed,
low drag,

526
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.100
high speed.
It's not going to be like that reddit for,

527
00:30:12.101 --> 00:30:14.950
especially with this kind of stuff,
if you,
if you already know you're insecure,

528
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.560
which is a big step ahead by the way.

529
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:20.440
Some people it or I'm not insecure and meanwhile they're getting it,

530
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.280
they know it,
but they just don't admit it.
Yeah.
So this guy,
he knows so,

531
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.790
but you're gonna feel it man.
When they call you be,
you know,

532
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.150
whatever they're calling you,
whatever.

533
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.960
You're going to sort of feel it on the inside still,
but just don't behave,

534
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:35.260
you know,
in a way just be like,
Oh,
I dunno,
I dunno what to do.

535
00:30:35.261 --> 00:30:38.350
There's plenty of things to do.
But yeah,
I mean you do want to get there.

536
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.100
Hundred percent check.
Next question,

537
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.910
<v 0>jock.
Tell me three,
sorry.</v>

538
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:51.720
<v 2>How do you deal with ultimatums from customers,
bosses,
et Cetera,</v>

539
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.610
that are unrealistic due to the nature of the situation and the ultimatum.

540
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.300
<v 0>What am I to do with ultimatums is I am going to tell the truth</v>

541
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.170
about the situation to them,

542
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.220
but first I'm going to tell the truth about the situation to myself because you

543
00:31:15.811 --> 00:31:19.530
got to look at the situation and say to yourself,
is this truly unattainable,

544
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.240
like truly unattainable and,

545
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.660
and sometimes even though it seems truly unattainable,

546
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.530
but then when you actually think about it,
you realize,
oh,
I could attain this.

547
00:31:28.531 --> 00:31:29.430
I can make this happen.

548
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.150
I'm going to have to sacrifice whatever to make it happen.

549
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.530
I'm going to have two to co,

550
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.660
it's going to cost me or the team or the company something in order to make an

551
00:31:42.241 --> 00:31:44.560
APP.
Like,
Oh,
you want that done,
or you want that,

552
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.200
you want that project done by the 15th cool.
We'll get it done.

553
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.570
Uh,
but here's what we're not gonna be able to do,

554
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:52.950
or here's what I'm not going to be able to do.

555
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.240
And I'm also gonna make sure that I pressure test the ultimatum against me

556
00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:06.030
giving the absolute full measure of effort,

557
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.580
right?
Like,
wow,
if I go 110% right,

558
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.690
not even honored percent beyond,
you're going to give it everything you can.

559
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.600
Is it achievable?
Because a lot of times people will do,
it's an old community,

560
00:32:18.601 --> 00:32:22.530
can't make it.
Well,
as a member of a team,

561
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.390
I want people's attitude to be like,
you know what?
We're gonna do it.

562
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.820
We're going to get it done.
No one else would be able to do this,

563
00:32:29.821 --> 00:32:32.350
but we're going to do it.
Watch.
That's,

564
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.620
I like saying that sometimes watch,
watch.
I used to say,

565
00:32:37.621 --> 00:32:41.490
watch me work.
Yeah.
Where I got it from some really,

566
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.450
so then,
okay,
so now you truly,
you tell yourself the truth about the situation.

567
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.480
You figure out that there's truly under no circumstances that this is possible.

568
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.270
Then it's my time to tell them the truth,

569
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.910
which is like listen and I'll get my data together,

570
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:03.740
I'll get my information together,
I'll explain to them what,

571
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.060
you know,
what,
why I can't,
I'm not going to be able to physically get this done.

572
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:13.180
It's physically not possible and then you know what the shortfalls are going to

573
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:16.790
be.
Now I once I explained that to them,
if they're,

574
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.350
if they're completely unwavering,

575
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.080
cause if you explain everything and you put your data together and you say,
look,

576
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.380
the bottom line is to d two to assemble this many pieces by our best to people

577
00:33:27.051 --> 00:33:27.780
on the team,

578
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.030
they'd take some on outreach and you want us to assemble 14 of them in three

579
00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:36.350
hours.
It is not possible for us to do that
in.

580
00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:37.460
Even if you gave me more people,

581
00:33:37.461 --> 00:33:39.890
it doesn't matter if they didn't know how to do that.
So it can't be done.

582
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.330
I need at least whatever,
six hours with those,
but whatever,
whatever it is.

583
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.740
If they're unwilling to to waiver on the ultimatum at all,

584
00:33:51.111 --> 00:33:53.780
like no,
go.
You need to get it done.
You need to get done.

585
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.760
Well then what I'm gonna do,
okay,
I'm going to try my hardest.

586
00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.220
I'm going to buckle down,
I'm gonna do my best.
I'm going to see how much,

587
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:04.760
how close I can get to achieving the goal.
I'm going to have fun.

588
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.750
I'm going to go so hard that it's going to get nuts,

589
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.400
like we're going to get it done.
And then when,

590
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.030
if we fall short,
which we will,

591
00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:21.320
because I figured out there's no physical humanly possible way to make this

592
00:34:21.321 --> 00:34:21.890
happen,

593
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:26.890
then what I'm do is I will go to them and I'll explain the things that I am

594
00:34:27.381 --> 00:34:30.770
going to do differently next time in order to meet their goals.
Right?

595
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.990
I want to say,
listen,
you know what,
I,

596
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.610
I should have asked you earlier if this was a possible thing and I should have

597
00:34:37.611 --> 00:34:38.900
had a backup plan.

598
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:41.240
So here's what I'm putting into place now to make sure this doesn't happen
again.

599
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.890
Or Hey,
I am going to need more manpower so that if we run into this again,

600
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.820
I've got the people,

601
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:51.910
it's my fault for not staffing us up correctly or I need to pay more attention

602
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.330
to what's happening in the future so that I can have a better aware,

603
00:34:56.331 --> 00:35:01.070
I have better awareness of when this type of situation will unfold so I can have

604
00:35:01.071 --> 00:35:05.780
my team prepared for it or these complexities that happened.

605
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.660
I didn't explain to them.
I didn't explain them to you well enough.

606
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.750
And so if you understood,

607
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.630
if I do a better job of making you understand the difficulties of making this

608
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:18.830
happen,
hopefully you'll realize that there's more time is needed.

609
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.870
So I'm not going to go in there and throw up my arms and see you.

610
00:35:21.871 --> 00:35:25.460
I told you so you were stupid.
I was right.

611
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.700
Because then that's just sabotage to now.
They don't believe you anyways.

612
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.730
Now when you say,
well,
we couldn't get it done.
See,
like I told you,
I told you we,

613
00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:35.600
we need more time.
And they're like,
yeah,
of course you,
you know,
you,
you,

614
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:38.190
you went into it thinking you're gonna fail.
And guess what?
The self fulfilling

615
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.510
<v 2>prophecies.
Good job.
Yeah.
Good job.
You proved yourself to be right.
Loser,</v>

616
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.543
demoted.

617
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.940
And that's what I do up and down the chain.
By the way,
you know,

618
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:55.860
ultimatums can come up and down the chain of command,
hold a line,

619
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.340
do your best.
That's what you do.
Yeah.
That seems,

620
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.170
and tell the truth of it all starts with telling the truth to yourself and then

621
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:07.260
to your people that you're charged customer,
you know,
client,

622
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.530
I want this foundation poured by such and such a date.

623
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:15.620
Hey Week we will do our best.
Here's the shortfalls,
you know,

624
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:19.140
whatever.
That's the way it is.
Yeah.
And that's a big one.
They're like,

625
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.490
where I kind of learned this from you,

626
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.470
where it's the cause you can like t to tell you like,
oh hey,
I can't,

627
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.810
this can't be done.
Like he kind of,

628
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.580
you get to the point in your mind where you're like,
we both know it can be done,

629
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:36.870
but it does,
you know,

630
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.440
given my current risk and sleep schedule and you know,

631
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.910
I got this chill,
I like to watch it.
That'll kind of,
you know,

632
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:48.780
it's like that kind of situation.
I don't want to miss that.

633
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.580
So it,
it,
it kind of shapes up to be like that,
you know?

634
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.450
Whereas like for sure we both know and I don't know,
you know,

635
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:00.990
like if there's a boss who's like just grinding someone into the ground.
Okay.

636
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:03.570
That's a whole different scenario.
But yeah,
at the end of the day,

637
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:05.310
like if you're truthful and it was like,
Hey,

638
00:37:05.311 --> 00:37:07.710
get this done or you're fired kind of thing.

639
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.920
And then you start with the truth that you say,
it'd be like,
can I get it done?

640
00:37:10.921 --> 00:37:13.670
And then you really think,
let's say like you were going to die.

641
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.670
I didn't know you could get it done a lot of the time.

642
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.480
I'm not saying all the time.
Of course,
of course.

643
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.650
The amount of times in my naval career,
let's call it when I was in the navy,

644
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.600
that guys said to me like,
we can't do it.
I can't even remember times like,

645
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.860
cause guys were the guys just like damn.
Like I know.

646
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.510
Yeah.
Yeah.
They wouldn't be like,
well I don't know Jocko.
I'd be like,
hey look,

647
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.870
here's what we've got to get done.
Yeah,
I think we can do it.
And they'd be like,

648
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:46.680
Yup,
cause we're about to go get some.
But yeah,
man,
you know,

649
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:51.450
obviously the situation,
some situations are more like more serious,
you know,

650
00:37:51.451 --> 00:37:55.260
like you're not going to,
I don't know for sure.
But yeah,

651
00:37:55.261 --> 00:37:57.780
that telling the truth thing tell the truth.

652
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.790
I do speak from a position of luxury where I have the truth reflected at me

653
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
pretty accurately on a pretty regular basis.

654
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:08.160
So I'm not saying it's that easy to tell the truth,

655
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:11.220
but if you just try hard try January,
you've got to be genuine,
right?

656
00:38:11.221 --> 00:38:15.270
Genuinely be like,
yes,
this is true about myself.

657
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:20.400
Do it.
Check.
Next question.
Question for the next podcast.

658
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.230
Is your wife disciplined?

659
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.130
How do you navigate a potential mismatch between you two?

660
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:31.440
What about when family non disciplined costs you unexpected time and energy

661
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:36.010
taking from your goals?
Family nondisciplinary what?
Like my

662
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.860
<v 0>family's not being disciplined.
Yeah.
Not on board or whatever.</v>

663
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:42.130
They're not on board with the program.
My wife is,

664
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:47.430
she runs a tight ship and is disciplined in a little bit of a different way than

665
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:51.610
me.
Then she's not the same as me.

666
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:57.990
And if that were to cause some kind of a conflict between us,

667
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.671
we'll then,

668
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:05.671
that's my fault for not communicating with her and allowing her to understand my

669
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:09.190
perspective and understanding her perspective.

670
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:14.080
So for instance,
what are,
what's the situation,
right?

671
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:18.040
Oh my wife wants me,
you know,
she wants to spend time with me in the morning,

672
00:39:18.041 --> 00:39:21.820
whatever.
Right.
When you do wake up early and workout before she's awake,

673
00:39:21.821 --> 00:39:26.410
you're working out.
It's not her fault.
It's not her fault.
It's my fault.

674
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.870
Well,
what about when,
oh,
I really want to eat dinner with you at night.
Okay,
cool.

675
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.680
I'll eat dinner with you and I'll stay up later at night so that I can get my

676
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:40.030
work done and that's fine.
You go to bed,
that's not,
that's not,

677
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.880
that's not my response.
That that's not your responsibility.

678
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.020
That's my responsibility.

679
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.670
It's not your responsibility to mold your life around my whole life.
Right.

680
00:39:48.671 --> 00:39:53.470
That's not,
that's,
that's not the way it is.
And by the way,

681
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:58.710
when the family is doing something that is taken away,

682
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:04.960
what did you say?
My energy taken away my energy and taking away my time.

683
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.950
Then I fixed that problem.
And when I say that I fixed the problem,

684
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.750
I don't mean I fix them.

685
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:17.350
I don't mean that I impose my discipline on them.

686
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.240
I'm,
it might involve some adjustments or some attempts to get adjustments,

687
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.280
but I'm not be just really simple.

688
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.330
I don't blame my family when things don't go right.

689
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.880
I couldn't work out today because my kid was sick.

690
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.120
My daughter spilled the milk and I was like,
Hey,
this is the same.

691
00:40:43.121 --> 00:40:44.380
This is just about ownership.

692
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.310
Like if you just want to blame your family when you're weak or you make a

693
00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:51.400
mistake or you didn't organize or you didn't explain to people correctly,

694
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:57.280
then that's the way it is.
I can say this to your family is not you.

695
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.240
Your family is not you.

696
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.200
They aren't on your program.

697
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:10.750
That's not there.
That's not their deal.
Hey,
if they're on it,
great.
That's cool.

698
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.140
My family's not all on my program.

699
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.620
That's not the way it works.
You Impose,
oh,
that's fun.

700
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.070
There was,
where's that kitchen?
You?
Oh,
you want to,

701
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:27.130
you want to impose your program on everyone in your family.

702
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.580
What are they going to do?
What?
It's the same thing that happens with any team.

703
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:35.300
If you start imposing your strict discipline on them,

704
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.760
cool.
You can get them to do what you want him to do at that moment.

705
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.760
Guess what they do?
As soon as they get the opportunity to rebel against you,

706
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.950
they rebel.
You get a mutiny.

707
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:48.100
You get a kid that's rebellious beyond the norm that's doing thing that's

708
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:50.780
actually gonna going to really reject you,

709
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:55.820
so you got to,
you don't blame your family.

710
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.110
Fix the problem.
Do you know who you have control over?
You?

711
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.640
You don't have control.
You don't have control over your nine year old kid.

712
00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:04.220
You might think you do,
but you don't.
You got to make,

713
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.450
you don't have control over your wife to just make her,
you know,

714
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:13.010
get in the game.
Oh,
you want to,
you want to stay on the program,

715
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.160
you want to cook,
uh,
uh,
whatever.

716
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.210
14 chicken breasts on a Sunday night.
So you've got two a day during the week,

717
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.140
honey,
make it happen.
No honey,
don't make that happen.

718
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:30.840
If you are a good leader and you explain what your goals are and you get her on

719
00:42:30.841 --> 00:42:33.350
board with the program,
then yeah,

720
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.220
guess what she's doing on Sunday night helping you cook some chicken breasts for

721
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:41.180
the week.
Yeah,
but this is just like anything else,
man.

722
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.250
This is just like any other leadership situation.

723
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:47.180
You want to blame the team when something's going wrong that's not going to get

724
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:50.330
you a solution.
You need to take ownership of the problem.

725
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.780
You need to get the problem solved.
And when I say get the problem solved you,

726
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.550
this doesn't mean impose your will on the team.

727
00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:02.150
That means you need to lead the team and there's a big difference.

728
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.560
So
get some,
yeah.

729
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.590
Yeah I can do.
And by the way,
the better.
Just like anything else,

730
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.790
just like Hackworth,

731
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:18.350
the better relationship that you build with your wife and with your kids,

732
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.020
guess what?
The more flexibility you have,

733
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.320
the more leeway they give you.

734
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:29.030
The worse relationship you build with your wife and kids,

735
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:32.560
the less flexible and the less leeway and the less chicken breasts you're going

736
00:43:32.561 --> 00:43:36.920
to have cook for you.
It's true.
They're not in the game with you.
Yeah.

737
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.770
So build a relationship.
I know that might sound like like,

738
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.130
oh well we're married so we have relationship,
not necessarily true.

739
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.780
Build a relationship.
Make them understand where you're coming from.

740
00:43:47.781 --> 00:43:51.290
Make them understand what the strategic goals are.
Yeah.
Make them understand.

741
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.880
Just like in a leadership situation,

742
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.240
make sure they understand how the strategic goals that you're trying to achieve

743
00:43:56.241 --> 00:44:00.140
for yourself will then come all the way back down and impact them in a positive

744
00:44:00.141 --> 00:44:02.380
way.
Cause by the way,
if you're doing things strategically,

745
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.270
are gonna help you that are going to screw over the rest of the team or in this

746
00:44:05.271 --> 00:44:06.830
case family.
Guess what?

747
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.710
You're not going to get support for those goals because they're not helping out

748
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:14.300
the team.
If you're doing it for yourself and yourself only that's problematic.

749
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.990
So if you're,
hey,
I want to work out,
I want to get,
you know,
I want to work out,

750
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:25.100
I want to train Jujitsu every day.
Okay,
well how do I benefit from that,
honey?

751
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.200
Okay,
well let me tell you how.
Here's my plant in six years,
I,
you know,

752
00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:32.160
I'm a purple belt right now it's six years.

753
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.650
<v 2>I'm going to get my black belt and when I get my black belt,</v>

754
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:36.450
we're going to open a school and when I opened a school,

755
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.730
guess what we're going to do all day?
We're going to teach Jiu Jitsu.

756
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:40.200
We're going hang out at our gym.
We're going to have a good time.

757
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:42.900
That's a strategic goal.
I need you in the game with me right now.

758
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.730
That's totally different than a droid.
Yup.
I'm a man.
Yeah.

759
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.350
Don't keep me,
keep me from this.
Well,
yeah,
in that too,

760
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.150
depending on who you are,
obviously,

761
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:57.060
but I would even say that's even just speaking from my own experience,

762
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.260
that's even over saying it really.
Like,

763
00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:05.370
let's say you take Jujitsu or working out or whatever,
you know,
to do that,

764
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.930
but I get it.
I get the example for sure.
No,

765
00:45:07.931 --> 00:45:12.030
you're using something much more simple,
easier way more bay and just say,
Hey,

766
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:15.240
this,
this,
this part of my life.
Even if it's new,
it's a new,

767
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:18.810
I know our family's chaotic.
You need my help with the kids and be like,
but hey,

768
00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:22.020
this,
this sort of,
this means a lot to me and it makes me feel good.
Makes me,

769
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:25.620
you know,
a happy person or whatever.
It can mean you can.
We make this work,

770
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.480
you know,
candle can,
we does what?
Do you know how you like this other thing?
Sure.

771
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:35.350
Yeah.
I want to support you doing that.
Here's where I need support,
right?
Yeah.

772
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:38.450
Just think,
puts a smile on my face.
Yeah.
You want me smiling around here?

773
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.660
That's what,
and people,

774
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:43.620
I'm sure someone's going to bring up the fact that there were times when I was

775
00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:47.700
in the dirt and I would come home from work at seven 30 at night,

776
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.710
I'd pick up my gym bag,
I drop off my my work bag,
and I just walk.
I'd go,
Oh,

777
00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:53.790
hang on,
I'm going to train.

778
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:59.040
And there was a few times where she did not want me to go train tears in her

779
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:03.030
eyes.
You gotta be kidding me.
You've been gone all week.

780
00:46:03.031 --> 00:46:03.960
You've been gone for two weeks.

781
00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:06.660
You come home at seven 30 and you're going to go train instead of eating dinner

782
00:46:06.661 --> 00:46:08.510
with us.
I was like,
Yep.

783
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.870
The reason I bring that up,
because I know someone's gonna bring up,

784
00:46:12.871 --> 00:46:15.360
that's not good leadership.
That's not me being cool.

785
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.620
That's not me building the relationship.
That's me moving in the other direction.

786
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.570
Yeah.
So that's not what I'm saying to do,
but if you come home,
hey look,

787
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.570
here's the deal.
Here's what's going on.
Here's why I,
you know what I've got?

788
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.350
I'd come home from work.
I got a lot of stuff in my brain.

789
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.150
I'm in a bad mood when I come home and I don't want to be in a bad mood around,

790
00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:37.920
you don't want to be a bad mood around the kids.

791
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.710
I'm going to go train for an hour.
When I come back,

792
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.850
I'm gonna have a smile on my face.
Watch
what?

793
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:50.310
Boom man,
like,
and,
and that's actually my wife eventually told me like,

794
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.390
oh,
when you don't train,
you're not nice to be around.

795
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.760
Not that I was intentionally going on and you get to try it.
No,

796
00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:01.070
but you just have the,
uh,
you don't,
you don't have that release.

797
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:05.100
That is a real thing for sure.
I mean it's manageable.

798
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.650
Everyone's different I think,
obviously,
but I wouldn't,

799
00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:11.860
you can even say something even more,
cause that's a hard one to,

800
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.590
to sell sometimes to some people to be like,
hey,
all be happier,
you know?

801
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.750
Then they'll be like,
well or except for that all be happier.
Maine's,

802
00:47:21.751 --> 00:47:25.230
we'll be happier.
Yeah.
And you got to,
you're right though.
You got to,

803
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.750
you got to give and take.
Right.
You've got to say,
okay,
what do you,

804
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:30.670
what can I do for you?
Exactly right.
That's,
that's what it is.
Be like,
Hey,

805
00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:34.630
this means a lot to me.
You know,
to,
and usually,
you know,

806
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:36.790
in a relationship like that,

807
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:40.090
they care if something means something to your husband and wife or whatever.

808
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.170
Like that's not nothing.
That's something,
you know,
look,
if you,
if the,

809
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.390
if you're a husband and you say this,
you,
it means a lot to me.

810
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.500
Therefore you need to sacrifice your whole thing to accommodate it.

811
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:54.130
You can do that,
but it's not nothing.
So you can say,
hey,

812
00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:59.131
as a leader you can't have the team sacrifice everything thing.

813
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.980
Yeah,
exactly.
Through I do a good job on this mission,
I'm going to get promoted,

814
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.280
you know,
or hey,
if we do a good job with this product,

815
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.600
I'm going to make more money.
Bottom line,

816
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.060
it's more from my bottom line profitability for our shareholders.
No one cares.

817
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.310
The front line doesn't care about profitability for their shareholders unless

818
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:17.020
they understand how it relates back to them.
Yeah.

819
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:20.320
So family doesn't care about you train in Jujitsu unless they realize how it's

820
00:48:20.321 --> 00:48:24.250
going to come back to you.
So what you do is you tell her like,
hey,

821
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.850
can we make this work?
And actually whatever,

822
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.910
however this gets in the way of us,
you know,
like whatever.

823
00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:35.530
Like I want to just in general make that up to some way,
you know,
like what can,

824
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.650
what can I do for you?
Like I said,
or,

825
00:48:37.651 --> 00:48:39.810
or what do you want to do something or let's,

826
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.340
let's do this so we can both kind of have something fun.

827
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:44.290
Come with me if you want,
but hey,
don't,
don't,

828
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.080
don't just automatically expect your wife to love Jujitsu.
Like,
yeah,

829
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.710
I'd love to do too.
Unfortunately,
unfortunately goes for everyone.

830
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.450
Even though most it's possible.
It's very possible.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I'm saying,

831
00:48:55.451 --> 00:48:59.830
you know,
if like how you're saying like make it make,
you got to accommodate it,

832
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.020
you know,
certainly if you're doing like a workout,
it let's say,

833
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:06.280
and it's your thing,
right?
Okay,
look dope,
work out,
you know,
and that's my thing.

834
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.490
Whatever do you get to I think is a different one because working out is like,

835
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.900
you can kind of do that whenever.
But Jujitsu is like,

836
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.310
if you don't be,
you got to go train with some people.
Yeah.
You know?
So yeah man,

837
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:22.720
if in constant communication too,
by the way,
like you,
you know,

838
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:26.080
cause after a while it's like,
how are you going to do two again?

839
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:26.801
And you're like done.

840
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:29.500
And the kids kind of need help with the homework and I'm swamped with this other

841
00:49:29.501 --> 00:49:31.090
family stuff,
you know,
kind of thing.

842
00:49:31.091 --> 00:49:33.730
But if you're constantly communicating and then she'll tell you,
hey,

843
00:49:33.731 --> 00:49:37.090
do you mind not going on this day because of this?
And you're like,
okay,

844
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.410
me going on this specific day,

845
00:49:38.411 --> 00:49:41.410
is that more important than the help that they need with the homework?
You know?

846
00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:44.090
And you can accurately kind of navigate your way through your,

847
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.060
your new situation,
you know?
But yeah,

848
00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:49.030
you gotta keep talking on that one because some people they think,
oh,
I can go,

849
00:49:49.031 --> 00:49:51.230
do you get to know?
And I don't have to say nothing about,

850
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.270
I'm just rolling out under every circle.
You know?

851
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.520
It doesn't work like that sometimes.
Don't,

852
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:58.890
don't be like me and don't be like Taco.
Well,

853
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:03.730
my wife is very understanding.
Yeah.
So that's great.
Sure.
Yeah.

854
00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:07.300
My wife probably would have murdered me,
rightfully so,

855
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.110
like killed me as a crime.
Next question,

856
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.700
we'd love to hear your thoughts on the deck economy of honest self expression

857
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:20.230
versus normal face and or passion versus discipline.

858
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:24.490
Uh,
if you aren't caught up on all the podcasts,
normal faces that came,

859
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:28.490
I used to play with my kids where they would have to keep an expressionless face

860
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.320
<v 0>or what I called the normal face.
Good game by the way.
And you,</v>

861
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:36.170
I would line up my kids and they would have to keep that face and then if they

862
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.230
change their expression anyway,
I would hit them in the head with a,

863
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.830
with the inside cardboard role of a thing of wrapping paper and or I had

864
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.770
eventually made like foam pieces for it cause they were a little bit more

865
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:52.490
durable and,
and you could hit really hard and it wouldn't hurt it at all.

866
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.480
So anyways,
I know it sounds like you should call child services on me,

867
00:50:56.481 --> 00:51:00.440
but it's fun game to play because as you hit one kid that makes the other kids

868
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:02.550
laugh and then you end up hitting them all and everyone was laughing and it's

869
00:51:02.551 --> 00:51:03.610
fun.
So,

870
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:09.070
and there's also a pragmatic reason to do it because it teaches people to

871
00:51:09.411 --> 00:51:13.250
control their emotions and there are times,

872
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.340
there are many times where you have to learn to control your emotions.

873
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.470
And as kids,
if you learn to control your emotions,

874
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.840
it's going to be beneficial for you in many ways.

875
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:24.950
But does that mean that you should keep a normal face all the time?

876
00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.200
Never show emotions.
No.
It's not like that at all.
There's like everything else.

877
00:51:30.201 --> 00:51:34.220
There's a dichotomy that you have to balance.
If your kid wins a wrestling match,

878
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:39.500
you should be happy and great and smiling.
Yeah,
high five.
Right.
That's cool.

879
00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.350
If you bite

880
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:49.060
into a amazing piece of prime rib that your wife cooked for you,

881
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:57.440
then you should raise your fist in the air and say,
yes,

882
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.930
my wife,
the first time she ever cooked primary,
she,
she,
she,
we didn't know this,

883
00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:06.150
but she has a talent.
She,
you know,
she cooks dry chicken prime rib.

884
00:52:06.151 --> 00:52:09.770
She knocks it out of the park.
First time she ever cooked prime rib.

885
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:16.040
And I took my,
I smelled amazing.
I was like,
Oh,
this is,
I took my first bite.

886
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:20.200
I looked at her and I looked up at her and I said,
I want to revamp,

887
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.430
redo our vows from marriage,
renewed the value,

888
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:30.140
renew the vows.
So yes,
um,
you know,
scenarios like that.
Yeah.

889
00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:33.410
You want to show your emotions and if here's something,

890
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.870
if your team slacks off

891
00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:42.390
and if you fail the mission,
you fail the task.
Of course you're going to own it.

892
00:52:42.391 --> 00:52:43.560
But you might,
you know,

893
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:47.490
you might want to show a little anger about what happened so that everyone knows

894
00:52:47.491 --> 00:52:51.240
like,
oh,
who's chocolate is normally get mad and he's mad.

895
00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.880
And so we really did something bad.
And,
and you know,

896
00:52:53.881 --> 00:52:56.100
even though you're blaming herself,
like I can't believe like this down.

897
00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:58.980
You know what I mean?
Like your show a little bit that people go,
okay,

898
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.200
so there going to show some.
Most you,

899
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:05.780
if you get bad and well if you give them news that that you know you got a

900
00:53:05.781 --> 00:53:09.230
friend that died,
we know that's,
you got to let those emotions out.

901
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.790
There's all kinds of situations where emotions are not only acceptable but

902
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:16.040
they're needed and they're required to.
And in fact,

903
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:20.090
if you don't have emotions in those situations,

904
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.560
that's horrible.
You need to have them not only as a person,
as a human being,

905
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:28.890
you need to let out your emotions sometimes.
But as a leader,

906
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.980
if you don't show any emotions at all,
no one's going to follow you.

907
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:38.990
There's no connection between you and the people on your team that if you ever,

908
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.900
if you just sit there and think about people that you've worked for that didn't

909
00:53:42.901 --> 00:53:45.540
have show emotions.
Yeah,
no connection with them.
You don't care about them,

910
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.240
you'll leave.
You won't go the extra mile to get the job done.

911
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.950
So you have to show emotions.
Of course,

912
00:53:52.951 --> 00:53:56.880
there are many times in life in the world where showing your emotions are going

913
00:53:56.881 --> 00:54:01.640
to have a negative impact on your situation.
Your [inaudible].

914
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:06.740
You give up the takedown in a Jujitsu competition and you show it in your face.

915
00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.180
That person just thinks I just broke.
Do you want to show any emotion?

916
00:54:12.181 --> 00:54:15.270
Their boss tells you you're getting stuck with the underperforming team.

917
00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:20.430
Show any emotion,
right?
Don't,
don't.
Oh Man,

918
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:25.320
don't do that,
but hey,
what about this?
There's a good one.

919
00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:28.050
Boss is giving you feedback that you don't agree with.

920
00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:34.500
Roll your eyes.
You know what I mean?
The the heavy side,

921
00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:37.250
the clenched teeth.
As you're trying to listen with this person,

922
00:54:37.251 --> 00:54:39.590
you don't even respect him.
He's telling us,
what's that going to get you?

923
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:44.090
I'm not going to get you anything.
Then showing that negative emotion there,

924
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.190
you need to keep normal face and that situation,

925
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:47.540
your kids doing something that's annoying.

926
00:54:47.541 --> 00:54:50.570
It's trying to test your patients and they're just trying to piss you off.

927
00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:53.540
Don't let them keep it in check.

928
00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:01.260
Get told to go to the other line in DMV after you've been waiting for an hour in

929
00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:05.140
one.
Don't freak out.
Don't show any emotions.
Got It.

930
00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.970
Here's,
here's another one.
We already talked about this one,

931
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:14.200
your friends or poke in front of you because you missed a shot at the range or

932
00:55:14.201 --> 00:55:19.060
you got lost on a land navigation course or whatever.
Get All mad.

933
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:24.010
Don't get frustrated.
Don't show any emotion.
You know,

934
00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.140
they make fun of your hair cut.
They make fun of your accent.

935
00:55:26.141 --> 00:55:28.870
They make fun of whatever.
Don't show emotions.
Don't freak out.

936
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:35.030
That's the other balance.
Now,

937
00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:40.060
there are also times where you might have to force yourself to show some emotion

938
00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.600
just to get the point across,
right?

939
00:55:41.601 --> 00:55:44.330
Your kid hasn't listened to you after five or six violations.

940
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:49.340
You might have to show some anger or they or they do something that's going to

941
00:55:49.341 --> 00:55:50.270
get them hurt,
right?

942
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:53.240
You got to show some emotions so that they realize that was real.

943
00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.190
But flying off the temporary flying off the handle and losing your temper is

944
00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.970
almost never does you any good.
So yeah,
you have to be balanced.

945
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:04.910
In order to be balanced,
you have to be in control and an order being control,

946
00:56:04.911 --> 00:56:08.660
you have to detach from your emotions so you can control your emotions and not

947
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:12.390
let your emotions control you.
Yup.

948
00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:17.570
I think we already talked about this one part before.
We're like,
you know,

949
00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.930
like with your kids or whatever and you're,
you fly off the handle,

950
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:24.070
not fly off the handle,
but you,
you show emotion,
you raise your voice

951
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.230
<v 3>and yell at them because this one is important.</v>

952
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.290
This lesson that I'm teaching that you obviously didn't get it before.

953
00:56:29.291 --> 00:56:33.280
What is your thing?
You can't do that every single time.
Of course,
you know,

954
00:56:33.281 --> 00:56:36.370
every single lesson like,
okay,
oh,
it was effective when it reasonably priced.

955
00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:39.430
Let me just raise my voice now.
Right.
Logically limb die if that,

956
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:44.390
if that is what induces their compliance,
let me just do that.
Right.

957
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:46.450
It doesn't work that way because after a while I like,
oh Brad Talk.

958
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:51.300
Just don't noise.
Yeah,
no.
So yeah,
you got to be like,
Yay.

959
00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:55.300
Yeah.
Or yeah,
just be like normal face,
north face,
north face.

960
00:56:55.301 --> 00:56:59.600
Everything you know and then like the one time you use it it's like the,

961
00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:02.560
what do you call the,
there's this video gave me used to play.

962
00:57:02.561 --> 00:57:06.970
It's like you could just press the button and
blow up everybody.

963
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:11.650
Anyway,
long story but yeah,
don't use it all the time is what I'm saying.

964
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:16.360
Just use it like sparingly.
Zane.
Yeah,
judiciously.
Cool.
That's good.

965
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:19.360
I do know what you're saying.
Next question.

966
00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:25.050
I'm in college and I'm working towards going to ocs after I graduate.

967
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.220
I work a food service job.

968
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:32.290
I was trying to teach a 17 year old at work why she shouldn't half ass cleaning

969
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:33.124
a fryer.

970
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:37.390
I said because of unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

971
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:39.550
That includes cleaning the fire.

972
00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:46.890
It still didn't quite get it.
I didn't say to her that I make the,

973
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:51.670
I make the fryer spotless because if I can't manage to clean the fire,

974
00:57:51.671 --> 00:57:56.671
how can expect myself to lead people in the military ipso facto war because I

975
00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:00.040
didn't think that,

976
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.810
I didn't think that was appropriate to say to that 17 year old girl.

977
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:09.160
I try to lead by example,
but I'm not sure that is enough.

978
00:58:09.161 --> 00:58:13.280
How can I best explain or show my younger coworkers why they should have unmade

979
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:16.360
mitigated daily discipline in all things when she,

980
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:20.350
when the stakes are only a fryer and not lives.

981
00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:26.620
Okay.
Let's see.

982
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:32.290
<v 0>This is where degree.
Wait,
we're kind of in the same vein on some stuff tonight,</v>

983
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:35.050
which is good,
right?
It's good.
First of all,

984
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:38.470
because unmitigated daily discipline and all things should be first and foremost

985
00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:42.280
applied to you.
Not,
not everyone else around you.
Let's start with yourself.

986
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.160
Imposing discipline on other people is not leadership.

987
00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:51.100
It's just an offer.
Authoritarian person barking orders.
Um,

988
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:55.690
so to answer your question,
well first of all,
read,
if you haven't read the book,

989
00:58:55.691 --> 00:58:59.560
the Dichotomy of leadership,
you might want to check that one out.

990
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.940
There's a couple chapters you could focus on.
One of them is called resolute,

991
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:07.750
but not overbearing.
One of them's called disciplined but not rigid.

992
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:11.710
One of them's called hold people accountable,
but don't hold their hands.

993
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:17.080
And this is pretty much why we had to write the dichotomy of leadership because

994
00:59:17.081 --> 00:59:20.020
you're out there,
good on you trying to take extreme ownership

995
00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:22.950
and that's great,
but you're not,

996
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.180
you're not paying attention to the dichotomy of leadership.
So let,
let me,

997
00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:31.590
let me break it down for you a little bit more clearly and then you can go read

998
00:59:31.591 --> 00:59:32.790
the book as well,
which will help you.

999
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:39.700
You say that the stakes are only a clean fryer and not lives

1000
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.950
and you're right,

1001
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:49.270
lives are not at stake and neither really is the functionality of the franchisor

1002
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.210
itself because it doesn't have to be completely spotless.
And in fact,

1003
00:59:53.211 --> 00:59:55.220
if you're trying to keep it completely spotless,

1004
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:57.800
it might actually waste time that she could be doing something that's more

1005
00:59:57.801 --> 01:00:02.801
important like prepping the potatoes or washing her hands to keep the food

1006
01:00:05.271 --> 01:00:09.560
sanitary.
So you need to think about that.

1007
01:00:09.561 --> 01:00:13.040
How truly important.
Like when you say on me when I say,

1008
01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:16.580
because I say this all the time and I apologize for throwing you a little bit

1009
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:21.200
too far in one direction.
Unmitigated daily discipline in all things.
There's no,

1010
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.590
there's no departure from that.
You're like,
right.
That's what it is.

1011
01:00:24.591 --> 01:00:28.310
There's no departure for that.
But here's the deal.

1012
01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:31.160
If you were in the military and you got spun up about little things that don't

1013
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:35.720
really matter,
you are wasting your leadership capital.

1014
01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:40.070
And when something is actually important,
it's what you were just talking about,

1015
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:42.350
Echo.
When something actually important comes up,

1016
01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:44.270
your troops aren't even gonna listen to you because they don't know what

1017
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:46.850
anything.
Well,
they don't know what's important and what's not.

1018
01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:49.670
Because you say that everything is important.
Like,
hey,

1019
01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:52.940
why do I need to stay on watch?
Why do I need to stay awake during watch?

1020
01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:58.420
That's not any more important to you than whether I have,
uh,

1021
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.920
a stain on my shirt because you're freaking out about everything.
So,
so who,

1022
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:03.980
how do I know what's what?

1023
01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.360
Now here's the deal.

1024
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:10.670
You can go too far in the other direction and you can let people do whatever

1025
01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:12.320
they want and it can completely lacked discipline.

1026
01:01:12.321 --> 01:01:16.520
And the little things do matter.
The little things do matter.

1027
01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:18.890
But you gotta remember they only met her a little.

1028
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.280
And if you waste your time and you waste your leadership and your waste,

1029
01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:26.990
your energy on things that don't matter or things that matter very little,

1030
01:01:26.991 --> 01:01:29.750
then you won't be able to lead your team when it really counts.

1031
01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.170
What happens is it's a slip,
it's a slope,
it's a,
it's a,

1032
01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:37.220
it's a slippery slope and if you let some things slide,

1033
01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.610
then you let something else side,
then you let something outside.

1034
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:44.210
Eventually you've got no discipline.
So you have to be careful of that.

1035
01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:49.500
But at the same time,
it's the other direction.
What you end up in,

1036
01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:51.900
in the other direction.
If you,

1037
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.640
if you impose on mitigated daily discipline in all things,

1038
01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:58.740
you're going to end up like,
um,

1039
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.150
here's a movie reference Echo Charles Animal House.
Sure.
Have you seen it?

1040
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:07.250
Yells Young?
No.
Okay,
so you don't remember Niedermeyer neater,

1041
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:11.190
the ROTC guy that just yell like it.
Every wall,

1042
01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:14.520
you're worthless and weak.
He's like that.

1043
01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:17.670
He's a guy that's just barking and going crazy.
And that's a comical example.

1044
01:02:17.671 --> 01:02:20.940
But I'll tell you what,
you want a example,
a real,

1045
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:24.390
a real good example that you can check out once again,

1046
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:29.070
go and watch the first episode of the band of brothers series and checkout.

1047
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.210
Captain saw Belle,

1048
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.230
<v 1>okay.</v>

1049
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:34.630
<v 0>The company commander of Easy Company,</v>

1050
01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:37.660
he is hardcore and he has,

1051
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:42.750
he imposes absolute unmitigated discipline in all things on his whole company.

1052
01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.490
He holds the line.

1053
01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:53.340
Oh,
dirty weapon.
No,
no liberty for you.
Pass,
revoked,

1054
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.040
rust on your knife,
past revoked,

1055
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.820
uniform out of uniform creases in your boots,

1056
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:04.200
your creases in your pants pass revoked.
Oh,
that guy's doing it.

1057
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.990
He's doing that on mitigated discipline in all things.

1058
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:11.490
And guess what happens to him?
He gets fired.
His troops hate him.

1059
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:15.660
He's worried about things that don't matter.
Dick winters,

1060
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.600
totally squared away worries about things that are important.

1061
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.213
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1062
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:25.360
<v 0>And as a individual,
and if you remember,
I don't even know if they showed us,</v>

1063
01:03:25.361 --> 01:03:29.900
and men are brothers,
but as an individual,
imposing discipline on himself,

1064
01:03:29.901 --> 01:03:31.820
guess what he'd doing during the battle of bulge?

1065
01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:36.470
Ballo Bolger middle of the winter,
snowed in,
don't have winter gear.

1066
01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:40.160
They're freezing.
They're dying.
What's winners doing in the morning?

1067
01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:44.170
He's up and he's shaving.
He's getting up in his shame,

1068
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.380
his battalion commander comes.
I was like,
Bro,
are you sure you need to shave?

1069
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:52.610
He's okay.
Just holding them on.
So

1070
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.330
that's why we wrote the dichotomy of leadership.

1071
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:59.660
This stuff has a balance and you have to learn to balance.

1072
01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:03.080
You don't want to end up going in,
ending up like captain.

1073
01:04:03.081 --> 01:04:08.081
So bell and I hope everybody that's has that tendency to want to control things

1074
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:15.680
and they want to use discipline and they want to use unmitigated daily

1075
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:16.520
discipline.
All things.

1076
01:04:16.521 --> 01:04:21.521
You want to use that as your slogan to beat people down.

1077
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:27.160
Go Watch the first episode of Band of brothers and get your act together.

1078
01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.220
You,
yeah,
the fry.

1079
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:35.780
That reminded me of when you were talking about your gym floor.
Yeah,
yeah.

1080
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.490
Don't,
I mean,
sure.
You don't want the,

1081
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:42.080
you don't want a bag and your dirty clothes and socks and shoes all over the

1082
01:04:42.081 --> 01:04:45.350
floor while you worked out,
but at this for a reason.
Yeah,
same way.

1083
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.040
The whole reason you got to clean the flyers or the fryer for a reason,

1084
01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.460
whatever the reason is.
I'm not as familiar with priors,

1085
01:04:52.461 --> 01:04:57.440
but I'm sure I work at Wendy's like I did.
I can tell you that the external,

1086
01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.790
the external cleanliness of the fryer is not a big deal.
Like you said.

1087
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:06.890
Do you want it to be caked with Greece where it's a fire hazard?
No.
Yeah,

1088
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.620
but guess what?
It's a functional item that you're using all day.
Right?

1089
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:12.200
There's going to be some spots on it and if I'm freaking out about that,

1090
01:05:12.201 --> 01:05:14.900
guess what?
I got somebody that's not washing their hands.
Or even worse,

1091
01:05:14.901 --> 01:05:18.040
I got someone that's intentionally sabotaging food.
So we get

1092
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.540
<v 2>bad reviews.
Now we're going out of business or whatever.
Yeah.</v>

1093
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.690
So it's essentially like,
hey man,
identify the youth,

1094
01:05:25.691 --> 01:05:30.691
the optimal use of the fryer and let's target that is like the the right way to

1095
01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:34.720
clean it kind of thing.
You know?
And that's sort of it.
Like don't,

1096
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:38.740
you don't have to sweep your gym floor and mop it and make sure that you can see

1097
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:42.610
your face in the,
I'm getting more chalk on that thing in 23 hours,

1098
01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.590
22 hours.
It makes no difference to why I have a gym floor,
the gym floor,

1099
01:05:47.591 --> 01:05:51.580
so I can drop weights and walk.
That's it kind of thing.
Not so you know,
I can,

1100
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:54.190
I don't know,
be super disciplined,

1101
01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:58.050
wasted my time mopping it and you know all this stuff because I'm unmitigated

1102
01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.830
daily discipline and all things,
you know,

1103
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.020
you have a functionality you have to uphold.

1104
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:07.360
Imagine how many hours of my life I would've thrown away if I was mopping,

1105
01:06:07.361 --> 01:06:10.980
cleaning,
sweeping,
and vacuuming my gym floor every day when I got,

1106
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:15.160
they would take as long as my workout would take.
Probably 20 minutes I guess.

1107
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.410
Yeah,
so there's,
there's what,

1108
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:21.400
almost two hours a week to a little over two hours a week.
Gone,
gone.

1109
01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.310
You think I got two hours a week.
Think about what two hour,

1110
01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:27.540
two hours is like a massive amount of time.
That's a,

1111
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:30.010
that's a good two hours is a huge amount of time.

1112
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.640
Unless that away you own a commercial gym,

1113
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.380
then you want a mop that floor because it adds to the functionality.

1114
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:40.270
Jim Getting members,
you know you're gonna,
you're going to get,

1115
01:06:40.271 --> 01:06:44.620
the floor's going to be clean.
Yeah.
But guess what?
Here go to the extreme.

1116
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.350
Hey we just cleaned that floor.
Don't walk on it.

1117
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.540
Jim is shutdown cause we just mopped it.
It's like,
no,
you just mopped it.

1118
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:56.530
We're gonna use it.
Yeah.
So it's kind of,
at the end of the day,

1119
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.900
it's kind of like what?

1120
01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:04.120
Unmitigated daily discipline in all things that what that are functional,

1121
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.970
that are functional for sure.
That our,

1122
01:07:06.971 --> 01:07:10.210
our our for yourself for put that on yourself.

1123
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.310
You put that on yourself and here's,

1124
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:14.770
here's you really want to take this to the next level.
Yes.

1125
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.920
Be disciplined in how you impose discipline on people.

1126
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:24.360
Don't just let it run wild.
You have to have discipline in it.

1127
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:28.600
That's the way it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1128
01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:30.700
It kinda does some paint that picture how you're saying,

1129
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.410
every time I get these questions it's like,

1130
01:07:32.411 --> 01:07:36.460
I'm so happy we wrote the dichotomy of leadership because there's the answer.

1131
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:40.660
That's the answer.
The answer is this.
All this is a dichotomy.

1132
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:44.110
Everything is done and people don't want it to be at like a dichotomy because

1133
01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:46.150
it's dichotomies are complex.

1134
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.950
Dichotomies are haired dichotomies take.

1135
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:56.690
It takes skill to learn to balance and it takes awareness of the situation.
Yeah.

1136
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.590
It's hard.
It's so much easier to say,
oh,

1137
01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.840
you just impose your discipline and make everyone do you want him to do.

1138
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:06.420
You can't do that.
You'll end up with a mutiny.
My,

1139
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:10.000
my second platoon that went when we had a mutiny,

1140
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:14.320
we worked for a guy that made us do everything his way,
my way or the highway.

1141
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:16.220
Guess what didn't work unique

1142
01:08:16.230 --> 01:08:20.320
<v 0>is he was a highway,
but not for us.
For him.
Yeah,</v>

1143
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:24.440
and not a bad guy.
It wasn't a bad guy.
We didn't have bad intentions.

1144
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:25.363
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1145
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:29.660
<v 0>But that's where this guy's heading.
He said an ocs,</v>

1146
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:32.270
and if he keeps with that attitude,
he's going to end up in those situations.

1147
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.141
The two beautiful.

1148
01:08:33.141 --> 01:08:37.610
I'm so glad he asked this question because I'm glad he asked this question

1149
01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:38.810
because it's not his fault.

1150
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.860
He's listening to what I said and I didn't communicate it well enough.

1151
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:47.240
So now he asked a great question and now he can take a much,

1152
01:08:47.241 --> 01:08:51.680
much better approach,
a much more balanced approach in his leadership

1153
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:54.770
like flying a kite.
Can

1154
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.610
<v 2>your flow,
Kate?
I had flown a kite but this has nothing to do with Flint</v>

1155
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:04.510
because I get bring it back on the yard to no,
but the fundamental principle,

1156
01:09:04.511 --> 01:09:07.420
right?
You know,
you're not,
well,
depending on what kind of Kite I get it.

1157
01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:10.310
But you know,
the kind with the two handles,
the two strings,
you know,

1158
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:12.250
you got to see what I'm saying.

1159
01:09:12.251 --> 01:09:14.950
You got to kind of pull one and let one go a little bit.

1160
01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:18.070
And then it depends on the wind.
You know,
it depends on how strong the wind is.

1161
01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:22.660
And you gotta pull crew,
let that slack out from telling you,
sure.
Fly a kite.

1162
01:09:22.661 --> 01:09:26.950
And I just flew on like maybe like five,
six,
seven weeks ago.
It's good.
Windy Day,

1163
01:09:26.951 --> 01:09:29.770
cold by the way.
Next question.
As a leader,

1164
01:09:29.771 --> 01:09:34.771
do you ever confide in anyone or seek counsel from anyone or do you just wrestle

1165
01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:37.570
with issues within yourself and try to figure things out on your own?

1166
01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.780
Another really good question.
And I do both of course

1167
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:45.680
<v 0>try and figure out things on my own.
But here's the little
secret.</v>

1168
01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.460
Is it a secret?
It's not really a secret cause I'm about to tell everyone.
Sure.

1169
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:51.500
But it's something that I wouldn't really talk about because it's just something

1170
01:09:51.501 --> 01:09:55.430
I'd wouldn't sink that we do.
Uh,
when I'm figuring things out on my own.

1171
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:57.380
At the same time,
I,

1172
01:09:57.710 --> 01:10:02.710
I seek counsel and they not only said seek counsel from the trusted teammates

1173
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:09.620
that I have or peers or superiors or,
or subordinates that I trust.

1174
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:11.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1175
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.810
<v 0>But why,
when I counsel them,
when I,
when I see council,
when I ask for feedback,</v>

1176
01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.420
while I'm trying to figure out things on my own,

1177
01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:22.620
I actually keep those thoughts to myself.

1178
01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:23.613
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1179
01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:29.800
<v 0>In the beginning,
right.
I let other people tell me what their ideas are.
First,</v>

1180
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.580
I want to hear what they come up with because if and if somebody comes up with a

1181
01:10:33.581 --> 01:10:36.040
good plan,
we're going with it.
Like if it's,
hey,
you know what?

1182
01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:37.270
That's pretty good plan.
We'll go with that.

1183
01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:42.800
Because as I've said many times I prefer to use one of my subordinates plan,

1184
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:45.640
one of my subordinates planned over mine.

1185
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:49.690
I would rather to use my subordinates plant rather than mine.

1186
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:54.690
As long as it's tactically sound,
because then they,

1187
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.810
they believe in their plan.
Right,
and if it's not tactically sound,
Yep.

1188
01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:02.550
I gave him a little nudge to make some corrections and still use their plan

1189
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:08.290
because I want them to use their solutions and their plants so that way,

1190
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.870
like I said,
they have ownership of the plan

1191
01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.250
and when they're coming

1192
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.320
<v 1>up with a plan,
guess what's going to happen?</v>

1193
01:11:16.321 --> 01:11:17.520
They're going to get too close to it.

1194
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.280
They're going to do what I talked about in that opening story,

1195
01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:22.710
which is they're going to,
they're going to be at low altitude,

1196
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:24.420
they're going to be staring at it right in the face,

1197
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:29.460
and I'm going to be allowed to remain detached and remain at altitude.

1198
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:32.100
So I have a better perspective of the overall plan.
Then they do,

1199
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:37.220
and that ends up making me look like a tactical genius,
which is awesome.
Hmm.

1200
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.170
<v 0>So the,
so I guess this is the secret.</v>

1201
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.360
This is the trick or whenever don't talk so much.

1202
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:48.000
Don't talk so much.
Don't feel the need.

1203
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.050
Don't feel the need is something you have to resist as a leader,

1204
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:55.830
as a person that wants to be a leader.
They've always said some about people,

1205
01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:58.980
aspiring leaders,
right?
If you're an aspiring leader,

1206
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:03.000
don't feel like you're the person that has to always come up with a plan or come

1207
01:12:03.001 --> 01:12:06.690
up with a solution.
Even when you are the leader.
Don't feel like you're that guy.

1208
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.070
In fact,
it's better than not do that.
It's better just to,

1209
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:13.260
to think into,

1210
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:17.730
just listen to what people are saying and watch their plans come out and get

1211
01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:21.570
shot down and cook,
get reformulated and be improved.

1212
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.430
And if you hadn't said anything yet,
guess what?

1213
01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:24.690
The longer you don't say anything,

1214
01:12:24.691 --> 01:12:26.610
the more people are gonna listen when you actually open your mouth.

1215
01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:31.500
So just kind of keep your mouth shut.
Now here's,

1216
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:33.820
this is a little bit different because we're talking about like a plan,
right?

1217
01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:38.220
A strategy or something.
What if it's something political within your team?

1218
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.820
You know what I mean?
Then what do you do?
What to use?
The same thing.

1219
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:44.580
Like I will think,
I will listen,

1220
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:49.910
I will discuss things with people and gather intelligence from them.

1221
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.530
Ask them some probing questions,

1222
01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:55.920
but I'm not going to divulge what my position is because number one,

1223
01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.420
that will influence them.

1224
01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:01.350
It will make them react and I don't want to influence anyone or make them react

1225
01:13:01.351 --> 01:13:06.351
to until I'm going to be able to influence them and get them to react and act

1226
01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:09.420
the way that I want them.
That's going to benefit the team.

1227
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:12.383
<v 1>So</v>

1228
01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:17.330
<v 0>I'm going to ask some questions.
Hey,
what do you think about,
hey,</v>

1229
01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:20.840
what do you think's going on with Jimmy?
Is He,
he seems to be accurate as he,

1230
01:13:20.841 --> 01:13:25.760
okay.
I'll ask you.
I'll ask him.
I'll ask Mike.
I'll ask bill.

1231
01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.520
I'll ask Jennifer Wolf.
I'll find out what's going on.

1232
01:13:28.521 --> 01:13:32.750
What's on our old Jennifer and bill.
They say something a little bit different.

1233
01:13:32.751 --> 01:13:36.230
Oh,
okay.
See,
I'm going to gather the political perspectives and

1234
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:42.890
listen.
I'm going to let things unfold.
I'm going to observe

1235
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:50.480
and relax and detach and listen and think and calculate.

1236
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.590
That's what I do and dichotomy.

1237
01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.340
If something needs to happen and I have to be decisive,

1238
01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.730
I'm going to make a decision.
We're going to go with it.
I'm gonna,

1239
01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:05.630
I'm gonna put it out there.
So oddly enough,

1240
01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:10.050
as a leader,
don't talk so much.
I know that seems crazy.
Hmm.

1241
01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.040
More talk.
The less people listen.

1242
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.160
<v 3>What about in like everyday stuff?</v>

1243
01:14:18.161 --> 01:14:20.890
I guess maybe this wouldn't really apply to as a leader,

1244
01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:24.580
but maybe like as a person,
you know how like,
like you,
uh,
you know,

1245
01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.790
[inaudible] hall,
like I'll have a prop come in and it'll be like,
hey,

1246
01:14:27.791 --> 01:14:29.890
let me get your advice,
whatever,

1247
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.840
about some thing that obviously it didn't feel like appropriate to just ask all

1248
01:14:34.841 --> 01:14:38.710
my friends kind of thing,
you know?
Like,
do you ever do that?

1249
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.600
<v 0>No.
You just mainly think about it yourself.</v>

1250
01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:49.910
What I would do is,
you know,
I do what I,

1251
01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:54.410
what I just said I would do,
I'd be like,
hey man,
what's going on with this?

1252
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:58.880
You don't know.
I guess if you were,
it's you when you come and ask me something,

1253
01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:00.230
you're asking me something.

1254
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:05.210
You always ask me about something I'm not a part of in any way.
It's different.

1255
01:15:05.211 --> 01:15:07.610
So yeah,
if it's like that,
if it's something I'm completely,
if something,

1256
01:15:07.611 --> 01:15:11.750
if there's someone that's completely outside the situation,
yeah.
I'll say,
hey,

1257
01:15:11.751 --> 01:15:15.710
this is what's going on.
You know,
this,
what's going on here?
We had this happen,

1258
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:19.870
I got this situation and just,
yeah,
for sure I'll do that.
Yes.
So that is,

1259
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:23.300
that is good.
But um,
but if it's within the team,

1260
01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:28.390
then I generally just won't come out and ask like,
Hey,
what do you,

1261
01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:32.750
you know,
I want to change this.
Instead I'll be like,
hey,
what do you,

1262
01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:34.640
what would you change about,
you know what I mean?

1263
01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.200
Ask them what they think first because you might have to make some adjustment.

1264
01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.400
If I come in and is like,
Echo,

1265
01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.520
we're changing the way we record this thing now here's what's happening.

1266
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:45.680
And you're like,
oh,
okay.

1267
01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:49.070
Then you're listening and the first thing you say to me is like,

1268
01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:53.210
that doesn't make any sense now.
I feel now I'm an idiot.
Especially when you say,

1269
01:15:53.211 --> 01:15:56.210
well,
here's the,
here's why it won't work,
Jocko.
Boom,
you lay out three things.

1270
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:57.680
Instead of,
I was like,
hey man,

1271
01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.740
what would you think about this issue that we're having?

1272
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:03.500
What solutions do you think we could do to solve that?

1273
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:07.550
And all of a sudden I get to listen to your ideas.
And by the way,

1274
01:16:07.551 --> 01:16:10.460
when you come up with one of those ideas and one of them sounds pretty good to

1275
01:16:10.461 --> 01:16:11.330
me,
guess what we're doing

1276
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:17.360
<v 3>now?
Who's got ownership of that idea now?
He's all fired up to implement it.</v>

1277
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:22.160
You do.
And I didn't waste any leadership.
In fact,

1278
01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:25.370
I gained leadership capital because now you're like,
man,
Jack was,
are you?

1279
01:16:25.371 --> 01:16:28.700
Trust me dude.
It's pretty cool.
He's letting me run this.

1280
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:33.110
Yeah.
And as speaking from person who doesn't necessarily,

1281
01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:38.120
well it doesn't seem like I necessarily get that big of a pay off to have that

1282
01:16:38.121 --> 01:16:40.250
to look,
I'm running this,
you know,
like an hour.
I don't know,

1283
01:16:40.251 --> 01:16:41.120
for whatever reason didn't,

1284
01:16:41.121 --> 01:16:44.450
I didn't never felt like that was a big thing to me to be the guy running it.

1285
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:45.471
But I don't know,

1286
01:16:45.471 --> 01:16:50.100
maybe it is maybe in my subconscious because I know that you do that to me and

1287
01:16:50.101 --> 01:16:50.211
I'm,

1288
01:16:50.211 --> 01:16:53.660
that's why it's actually kind of funny because you don't do it in beat with big

1289
01:16:53.661 --> 01:16:56.240
things necessarily.
You know,
may,
may,
maybe you will,
whatever.

1290
01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.130
But most of the time it's just some little teeny small thing.
And I'm like,
ah,

1291
01:17:01.131 --> 01:17:04.260
yeah,
you know,
just totally falling,
not falling for it.
I get it.
You know,
it's,

1292
01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.240
it gets a good tactic.

1293
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.980
But now that how you just Felita to illustrate it and meanwhile,

1294
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:09.980
I should know this.
I

1295
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.130
<v 2>do know this really,
that you do that it's not a bad thing.
No,
I'm,</v>

1296
01:17:14.131 --> 01:17:18.170
I'm smashing you over.
It's actually perfect.
Yeah,
I'm not,
I'm actually,
um,

1297
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:22.340
it's actually beneficial to you.
You're actually actually are running things,

1298
01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:25.820
you know,
if I come in and say,
hey,
we're,
you know,
hey,

1299
01:17:25.821 --> 01:17:29.330
what do you think kind of table we should get for the podcast or what,

1300
01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:30.290
you know what I mean?
What do you think?

1301
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.150
We think it would be the best lighting system.
You know,
like,

1302
01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.250
I know what I think that's the,

1303
01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:40.850
see that's the thing I don't really divulge is I know what I think.
Yeah.

1304
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:45.410
And you know what though,
which I know,
I understand,
but by the way,

1305
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.260
the table thing that I tried with on that one,

1306
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.920
they didn't want it little bit,
little bit.

1307
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:57.920
Actually I failed because I should've put much clearer parameters around the

1308
01:17:57.921 --> 01:18:00.920
table scenario.
And for those of you that don't know what we're talking about,

1309
01:18:00.921 --> 01:18:04.250
which is no one in the world except for us too.
We had,

1310
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:08.240
we got a different table for our,
for our recording studio,

1311
01:18:08.241 --> 01:18:11.510
which is right at this moment being expanded and but when,

1312
01:18:11.511 --> 01:18:13.520
when we were still in the small recording studio,

1313
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:16.820
I forget why we needed a new table just cause the other one was too big.
No,

1314
01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:18.560
we're adding another camera.
Okay.

1315
01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:23.090
We're adding another camera and possible guests.
So yeah,
so hey,
say hey man,

1316
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:24.430
you know,
go across the table.
And the one,

1317
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:29.210
the table that I had gotten in the past,
let's face it,
it was legit.

1318
01:18:29.211 --> 01:18:32.150
It was legit.
Echo goes and gets a table.

1319
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.430
I don't know if that thing costs $48 but it wasn't worth it.

1320
01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:43.430
This thing was a wiggly and small and weak and a,
anyways,

1321
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.970
that's an example where I didn't do a good job.

1322
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:51.500
And it's also an example of occasionally your,
your vision isn't aligned.

1323
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:56.720
Like my vision.
Normally you and I have very aligned vision about something,

1324
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:57.380
you know?

1325
01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:02.380
Well when it comes to the technical nature of what the podcast,

1326
01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.680
the table we weren't on,

1327
01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.000
I wouldn't have bought that table ever.

1328
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:11.660
Well I wouldn't have bought that table for like a,

1329
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:16.190
like a prop to be used in a one scene scenario

1330
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.250
that,
but,
well,
okay,
so I'll admit,

1331
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:26.300
I don't know if I told you this,
but I'll admit that the thing is you probably,

1332
01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:28.940
when you got your table,
you probably went somewhere and was like,
yeah,

1333
01:19:28.941 --> 01:19:32.810
that's the table you felt it and was like,
yeah,
I can imagine in your eyeball.

1334
01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:37.700
Actually I actually ordered it online,
but I,
I'd say I have more,

1335
01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:41.390
even though I know you worked for a moving company.
Nonetheless,

1336
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:44.720
I think I have more
um,

1337
01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:47.360
more worldly when it comes to furniture.

1338
01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:51.740
You might be right cause there's something wrong.
I saw it on Amazon.
I was like,

1339
01:19:51.741 --> 01:19:56.500
hey,
that's a cool table and that,
that fits the dementia.
It fit the dummy.

1340
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.990
Yeah.
When it came in,
it's the old story,
you know?

1341
01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:03.380
Oh it looked good in the picture.
It'll kind of thing.
Then when it shows up,

1342
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:04.480
it's like,
yeah,
you're like,

1343
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.330
that looks good in the picture and it's only $39 she lasted,

1344
01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:12.960
the other table we had was 1000 bucks.
Yeah.
Alright.
Yeah.

1345
01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:13.980
It wasn't a thought.
It wasn't there.

1346
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:18.990
She put a minimum price to ensure quality price to ensure some kind of quality.

1347
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:24.810
Yeah.
Anyway,
the point is yes.

1348
01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:29.430
When you give somebody,
you let it be their idea.
You keep your ideas to yourself.

1349
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:33.040
I'm not trying to be all secretive.
I'm not trying to be all secret.

1350
01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:33.431
It's not a cop.

1351
01:20:33.431 --> 01:20:36.600
I'm going to tell this person because eventually my idea is if it needs to come

1352
01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:38.130
out of it comes out.
Hopefully it doesn't come out.

1353
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.980
Hopefully it never need to come out because my team comes up with a great plan

1354
01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:44.620
and I can just be quiet and they can go execute it.
That's my goal.
Yeah.

1355
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:49.380
Occasionally they can't find a solution and it's like,
hey man,
you okay?
Hey guys,

1356
01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.110
and then maybe you don't.
I'll do.
I won't even divulge my whole idea.

1357
01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:57.180
I'll say he will.
What about you?
What about this?
What am I an idea like this?

1358
01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:01.140
Oh yeah,
that's not bad.
And Man,
when you see someone get a good idea,

1359
01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.830
they get so happy.
Yes.
It's so rewarding.

1360
01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:08.220
And so you want to give them that gift.

1361
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.180
And the way you do that is by letting them come up with their own ideas.

1362
01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:14.160
You just gotta make sure that they have a worldly experience with furniture.

1363
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.740
That's the situation.
Well,

1364
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:20.970
they go and I dig it and cause in a way it's not really even about the idea.

1365
01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:24.330
It's more about,
okay,
we need a solution to this problem.
I don't care what the,

1366
01:21:24.331 --> 01:21:27.900
you know,
there's a bunch of potential solutions kind of thing and yeah,

1367
01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:29.220
you might have one in your head,

1368
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:32.920
but you don't want to just start saying we're just throwing it around as the one

1369
01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:35.940
it also.
Yes,
you're right.
Also,
when you divulge your idea,

1370
01:21:35.941 --> 01:21:37.560
guess what happens to everyone else's ideas?

1371
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:38.760
Especially when you're in a leadership position.

1372
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.890
When you're in a leadership position and you devote your idea,

1373
01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:44.760
everyone kind of gravitates towards that idea as being the best.

1374
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.820
If you keep your idea to yourself,
you let the true growth of ideas develop.

1375
01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:53.010
True things come out when people aren't just trying to say like,

1376
01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.480
oh great idea Jocko.
Yeah.
Even even if they're not like a kiss ass but you just,

1377
01:21:57.481 --> 01:22:00.930
you just put an idea in their head and they can't see it a different way,

1378
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.300
you know?
And even if they do,

1379
01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:06.870
you put them in a position where now they have to shut down your idea and not a

1380
01:22:06.871 --> 01:22:09.630
big deal,
but it's still an added element that you have to,
you know,

1381
01:22:09.631 --> 01:22:12.690
you gotta kind of put them in as part of that position goes.
Yeah.

1382
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:16.680
Rather than you,
you'll just kind of open up the floor.
It's kind of like backing,

1383
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:21.060
you know who,
who else I'm going to say kind of kind of atmosphere,
you know,

1384
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:25.400
and we all can,
you know,
throw around ideas and the best one comes up.

1385
01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:28.520
There you go.
Thanks Brian.
Cool man.
I'll get a better table next to him,

1386
01:22:28.521 --> 01:22:32.850
I promise.
Next question.
As we get ready to graduate from college,

1387
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:35.610
I would appreciate your input on the following question.

1388
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:40.680
I've always loved to take part in a variety of projects and I have ended up in a

1389
01:22:40.681 --> 01:22:43.560
leadership position in multiple organizations,

1390
01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:49.170
be be it in student,
VC firm,
the student body,
my professional fraternity,

1391
01:22:49.171 --> 01:22:53.880
et cetera.
In a way,
this is,
this was natural to me.
It's about extreme ownership.

1392
01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:57.390
Right.
I love what I was doing and you shouldn't just slough off that,

1393
01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.890
that phrase.
Oh,
it's about extreme ownership.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.

1394
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.760
That's how it should have been said.
Okay.
It is.
Okay.

1395
01:23:02.761 --> 01:23:05.980
All this stuff is about extreme ownership,
right?
Can't be that hard.
Right.

1396
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.630
Kind of kind of,
uh,
of course the motor shit.
Right.
Okay.
I loved what I was doing.

1397
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:13.420
I had a vision where to take things and I was chosen to lead,

1398
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:16.930
so I felt that I was doing the right thing.
Recently though,

1399
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.850
I've started to feel overwhelmed and feel that my productivity has diminished by

1400
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:23.170
being in a managerial position.

1401
01:23:23.171 --> 01:23:27.250
It seems harder to see the direct output of my work,
but it's as easy.

1402
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.700
It is easy as always to see what's not working.

1403
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.480
I don't want to be let go of any projects because I'll still love to make love

1404
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:37.000
to take ownership of them.
Nobody says,
I don't want to be liquid,

1405
01:23:37.001 --> 01:23:41.920
says I don't want to let go of any projects because I still love to take

1406
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:44.350
ownership of,
Oh yes,
yes,
yes,

1407
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:50.890
I'm identifying symptoms.
Yeah,
you liked the word ownership.

1408
01:23:50.891 --> 01:23:52.750
That's like a like a really,

1409
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:55.510
I definitely like the word ownership and as you also know,

1410
01:23:55.511 --> 01:23:59.890
I also like another word that's dichotomy.
Dichotomy,
seen violations here.

1411
01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.640
All right,
well either either way,
this guy,
he,

1412
01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:07.270
he doesn't want to let go of any projects because I still love to take ownership

1413
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:09.730
of them and lead these organizations,

1414
01:24:09.731 --> 01:24:12.940
but I think I have no longer able to handle this much.

1415
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.420
How do you balance those things?
Yeah,
so there is a chapter

1416
01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:19.520
<v 0>in the dichotomy of leadership called own it all,</v>

1417
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:24.500
but that's not the title of the chapter.
So the title,
the chapter continues,

1418
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:28.670
the title,
the chapter is owned it all comma,

1419
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:33.850
but empower others and it sounds like this individual who's getting after it for

1420
01:24:35.931 --> 01:24:38.270
sure.
Props getting after it.
Leadership position,

1421
01:24:38.271 --> 01:24:42.800
multiple organizations going hard,
taking ownership.
Very cool.

1422
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:48.310
But it sounds like he needs to lean more towards decentralized command because

1423
01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.340
just because you take ownership of things doesn't mean you're supposed to do

1424
01:24:52.341 --> 01:24:55.790
everything that you take ownership of.
It doesn't,

1425
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:57.590
it doesn't actually doesn't work.
What this,

1426
01:24:57.591 --> 01:25:02.591
what you need individual is you need subordinate leaders inside these multiple

1427
01:25:04.581 --> 01:25:06.170
organizations that you're in charge of,

1428
01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:10.730
that you trust and you got to let them run with the broad guidance and the

1429
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:12.163
mission,

1430
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:17.210
the broad guidance of the mission and with your Commander's intent that that's

1431
01:25:17.211 --> 01:25:19.250
how you're gonna work on this.
So for instance,

1432
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:22.160
when I was in charge of training on the west coast,

1433
01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:27.800
I was responsible for a lot of stuff for land warfare,
for maritime operations,

1434
01:25:27.801 --> 01:25:31.940
dive operations,
air operations,
close quarters combat,
urban warfare training,

1435
01:25:31.941 --> 01:25:34.910
mobility training,
heavy weapons,
defensive tactics,

1436
01:25:34.911 --> 01:25:37.640
combat leadership in every other block

1437
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:43.200
for guys that are getting ready to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Oh.

1438
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:45.490
And on top of those tactical things,
I'm in charge.

1439
01:25:45.491 --> 01:25:50.080
I'm actually also in charge of safety and actually also in charge of maintenance

1440
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:53.290
and actually also in charge of the administration of the command.

1441
01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:57.670
That's a lot of stuff to be running,
right?

1442
01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:02.640
I know that homes is in charge of,
you know,
the the VC firm and the student body,

1443
01:26:02.641 --> 01:26:05.060
this,
that stuff too.
This is a lot of stuff.

1444
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:10.090
Could I personally manage and conduct all of those things that I was in charge

1445
01:26:10.551 --> 01:26:14.810
of?
Not even close,
not even close,

1446
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.270
not you.
You're talking about feeling overwhelmed.

1447
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:22.100
You wouldn't last 15 minutes if you tried to be the person that made every

1448
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:26.330
decision and all those different divisions that were inside of the training

1449
01:26:26.331 --> 01:26:27.164
command.

1450
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:31.520
So I couldn't manage and run them all myself,

1451
01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:36.521
but I had great leaders that I trusted that we're going to make things happen

1452
01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:41.980
and I gave them the broad guidance of what we were trying to do,

1453
01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.610
what they're part of the mission was the parameters that they were allowed to

1454
01:26:46.611 --> 01:26:51.110
work within and then go get some and it's the same thing.

1455
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:54.140
Task you to commander to I was tasking and commander got two platoons,

1456
01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.310
plus you've got a squad of of augmentees plus you've got CBS and you've got an

1457
01:26:58.311 --> 01:27:00.890
intel fuse in the sale and you got interrogators and you got radio

1458
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:04.040
communications crew and you've got the it crew and you've got,

1459
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:06.560
you've got the whole tactical operations center that you're running.

1460
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:10.250
And it's the same thing.
Like I can't run all that.
Nope,

1461
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:13.550
no human can run all of that.
So what do you do?

1462
01:27:13.551 --> 01:27:17.000
You have subordinate leaders that have the broad guidance.

1463
01:27:17.001 --> 01:27:19.430
They understand what the mission is,
they understand the commander's intent,

1464
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.160
they go forward and get after it and they,

1465
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:25.370
they know the parameters and sometimes they have issues and when they have

1466
01:27:25.371 --> 01:27:29.270
issues you can step in and you give them a hand or sometimes they get all of our

1467
01:27:29.271 --> 01:27:31.010
box.
You've got to put them back in the box.

1468
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:37.320
But it's the same thing.
Even right now I've got Ashkelon Front,

1469
01:27:37.321 --> 01:27:39.930
we've got the podcasts,
we've got the,
the store got the supplements,

1470
01:27:39.931 --> 01:27:44.490
the peril of online training common out.
We got the t,
the real estate,
the gym.

1471
01:27:44.491 --> 01:27:48.900
We get the list goes on and I can't,
I can't run all those things.

1472
01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:53.840
But I caught people bleeding those things and run on those things.

1473
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:56.240
And I could do the same thing.
It's like,
Hey,
here's the guidance,

1474
01:27:56.241 --> 01:27:57.860
here's the mission,
here's the commander's intent,

1475
01:27:58.190 --> 01:27:59.900
here's the sanity check on something.

1476
01:27:59.901 --> 01:28:01.670
Here's the parameters we're trying to move within

1477
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.430
and then go,
go and get some.

1478
01:28:07.890 --> 01:28:11.520
So if you do well with decentralized command,

1479
01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:16.500
you can handle a lot now to could you possibly bite off more than you can chew?

1480
01:28:16.501 --> 01:28:16.860
Yeah,

1481
01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:21.860
you could get involved in so many things that you don't even have time to

1482
01:28:23.371 --> 01:28:27.600
monitor the situations at all and you don't have time to tell when people are

1483
01:28:27.601 --> 01:28:30.840
getting out of their zone or out of the parameters that they're allowed to work

1484
01:28:30.841 --> 01:28:34.080
within.
Or you don't have time to help when something goes sideways,

1485
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.920
you don't have.

1486
01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.840
So you could get there and that will happen especially quickly if you have

1487
01:28:39.841 --> 01:28:44.841
failed to train and mentor and give directions and give guidance to the leaders

1488
01:28:45.811 --> 01:28:48.540
that you have that are actually on the front lines run and things.

1489
01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:51.373
<v 1>So</v>

1490
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:53.750
<v 0>that's part of it.</v>

1491
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:59.950
Now the other part of it is you can't do any of this if your ego will allow you

1492
01:29:01.831 --> 01:29:04.530
to let things go.
I mean,
you literally said,

1493
01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:09.000
I don't want to let go of any projects.
I've said this before.

1494
01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.000
If you want to be in charge of everything,

1495
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:15.060
you have to be in charge of nothing.

1496
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.700
You're goal should be in charge of nothing.

1497
01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:21.090
Only if you're in charge of nothing can you truly be in charge of everything?

1498
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.480
Because when you're in charge of every single thing,
guess what?

1499
01:29:24.481 --> 01:29:28.140
You can handle nothing.
You're task saturated.
It doesn't work.

1500
01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:30.563
<v 1>So</v>

1501
01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:36.520
<v 0>that's what you need to do.
Get some good solid leaders,
subordinate leaders,</v>

1502
01:29:37.090 --> 01:29:40.690
empower them,
train them,
trust them,

1503
01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:42.730
make sure they understand where they're going.

1504
01:29:42.731 --> 01:29:44.500
Make sure they understand what the mission is.

1505
01:29:44.710 --> 01:29:46.450
Make sure they understand what the goals are,

1506
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:52.380
make sure they understand what things are outside the box that they need to come

1507
01:29:52.381 --> 01:29:53.280
and talk to you about,

1508
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.130
and then let them rock and roll.
Boom.

1509
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:04.860
Do One more question.

1510
01:30:05.290 --> 01:30:09.040
<v 3>My wife and I suffered three weeks of turmoil,</v>

1511
01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.520
which including losing,
which included losing a child.

1512
01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:16.300
How do I expedite that moment when we pick up ourselves,

1513
01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:21.250
pick ourselves up and keep moving forward because I'm done sulking and we need

1514
01:30:21.251 --> 01:30:24.550
to move forward basically how to push through.

1515
01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:30.453
<v 0>So</v>

1516
01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.420
I mean obviously that's heartbreaking and I can't even imagine the pain that you

1517
01:30:42.091 --> 01:30:46.530
are going through in this situation.
And it's one of those things,

1518
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:48.210
we've talked about this before.

1519
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.480
The fact is we don't really have a cultural protocol for what to do.

1520
01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:56.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1521
01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:58.470
<v 0>When we lose a loved one</v>

1522
01:31:00.850 --> 01:31:05.850
and you have to basically make up that protocol.

1523
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:08.950
I can't,

1524
01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:14.780
I can't dictate what that protocol is going to be for you.

1525
01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:20.800
But I can tell you some things from my perspective,

1526
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:26.360
from some of the things that I've been through.

1527
01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:30.450
I can tell you my perspective on

1528
01:31:31.410 --> 01:31:32.243
<v 1>loss.</v>

1529
01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.060
<v 0>And the first thing is that you already know it's going to be wretched</v>

1530
01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:44.320
and you're not going to escape it.

1531
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:51.640
And that pain in this is,
this is something that I've identified.

1532
01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:57.040
The pain that's going to come,
it's going to come in waves.

1533
01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:02.880
And at first you won't even notice that their waves because all the waves are

1534
01:32:03.671 --> 01:32:08.020
going to be so close together and they're going to be so continual and they're

1535
01:32:08.021 --> 01:32:12.430
going to be right on top of each other and the pain and the sadness is going to

1536
01:32:12.431 --> 01:32:15.160
feel like it's so heavy.

1537
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:19.690
It's going to feel like you are drowning in sorrow.

1538
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:23.230
Like you're not going to get any air and like you're not going to be able to

1539
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:25.030
escape that sadness.

1540
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:29.320
That's what the waves feel like at first.

1541
01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1542
01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.600
<v 0>And then at some point there's going to be a little break,</v>

1543
01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:42.840
just a little break,
just a little bit of light in the darkness.

1544
01:32:42.841 --> 01:32:47.610
Something is going to make you smile.
Something is going to make you laugh.

1545
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:51.000
Something's going to just show you just a little bit of light.

1546
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:54.170
But I don't know when that's going to happen.

1547
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:59.670
And then you're going to see that little,
that little smile,
that little light.

1548
01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:00.700
And then the uh,

1549
01:33:00.710 --> 01:33:05.710
another wave of pain is going to come back again and it's going to be strong.

1550
01:33:06.391 --> 01:33:11.190
And you won't have any control over it.
You won't be able to say,
no,
no,
I'm,
I'm,

1551
01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:13.860
I'm in the right now,
or I'm smiling right now.
I'm not gonna,

1552
01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.170
I'm not gonna go back there.
No,
you're not going be able to control it.

1553
01:33:16.171 --> 01:33:19.350
And that's scary.
It's scary because we,

1554
01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:21.690
we get used to as adults,
hey,

1555
01:33:21.691 --> 01:33:24.780
we can kind of get control of things and now all of a sudden you're not going to

1556
01:33:24.781 --> 01:33:29.140
have control.
It's going to hit you and you're gonna feel it.

1557
01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:32.023
<v 1>But</v>

1558
01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:33.630
<v 0>again,
like a wave,</v>

1559
01:33:33.631 --> 01:33:38.631
like a wave in the ocean that is going to eventually subside again and you'll

1560
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.440
see a little bit of light and you'll get a little bit of a smile and you'll feel

1561
01:33:43.441 --> 01:33:45.600
okay for a second.
And then guess what?
Another wave's gonna hit you.

1562
01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.620
They might not be as strong as that other way.
Dea Wave.

1563
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:55.250
And you might not even notice that it's not as strong.
But again,

1564
01:33:55.251 --> 01:33:58.700
you can't control your emotions and you'll find yourself,

1565
01:33:58.701 --> 01:34:00.740
this is what I'm talking about factually.

1566
01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:06.800
You're going to be sitting there and all of a sudden you're going to be just

1567
01:34:06.801 --> 01:34:10.830
crying uncontrollably.
That wave is going to hit you.

1568
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:15.450
You're going to go from normal to just crying uncontrollably and being sad.

1569
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:21.100
That's what's going to happen.
And it again,
in your mind,
you can be thinking,

1570
01:34:21.101 --> 01:34:23.370
I can't control,
this isn't,
it's a wave and you're,

1571
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.140
you're at the mercy of this ocean of sorrow,

1572
01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:29.630
but don't let that scare you.

1573
01:34:30.090 --> 01:34:30.923
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1574
01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:35.780
<v 0>don't let that scare you cause I'm telling you that that wave is going to</v>

1575
01:34:35.781 --> 01:34:38.210
subside again and this is going to go on.

1576
01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.790
It's going to go on and the waves,

1577
01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.620
they will become weaker.

1578
01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.740
And what you need to realize is just because the waves are becoming weaker,

1579
01:34:50.741 --> 01:34:55.741
this doesn't mean that you love your child less or you miss them less or that

1580
01:34:56.621 --> 01:34:59.300
you rushed at their passing.

1581
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:04.100
It just means that you're starting to be able to deal with it,

1582
01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:07.010
which is what you're supposed to do.

1583
01:35:10.150 --> 01:35:15.040
And as the waves get weaker,
which they will,

1584
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:17.560
they'll also appear less frequently.

1585
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:21.170
And again,
that's okay.

1586
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.860
It doesn't mean that you don't think your child all the time.

1587
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:27.590
It just means that it's being dealt with.

1588
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:34.420
And while this is happening,

1589
01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:39.550
while you wait when you can,
when you start to when the,

1590
01:35:39.551 --> 01:35:43.600
when the storm waves start to calm a little bit,

1591
01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:52.070
what you can do is you can row the boat,
can row the boat.

1592
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:57.280
And what I mean by that is start doing something productive to get your mind

1593
01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:02.360
moving forward.
I don't know how long this is,
this,
this is,

1594
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:07.370
you know,
when you feel a little bit of a break,

1595
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:11.630
then let's do some a few days go by,

1596
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:14.870
five days go by,
three days go by.

1597
01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.290
At some point you can't cry anymore.
Okay,

1598
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:21.080
let's do something productive.

1599
01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.030
Let's sort out the drawers in the bedroom.
Let's back Qm,

1600
01:36:26.210 --> 01:36:29.780
let's finish a product.
Let's do something productive.

1601
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:32.360
And if there's something

1602
01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:37.460
that distracts you,
that's fine.
Do it.

1603
01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:42.930
Let,
let,
let there be some calm in the water

1604
01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:50.960
and also
as the,
as the calm columns.

1605
01:36:52.650 --> 01:36:55.410
Also you're going to find moments where it's like you can,

1606
01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.220
you can have things that are going to bring all of the waves

1607
01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:03.990
and that's okay to bring on the waves.

1608
01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:08.940
Go look at the pictures right down the memories.
Read the letters,
read the notes,

1609
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.490
read the emails,
remember?

1610
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:20.090
And then there's that standard service.

1611
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:23.360
You're going to do the memorial,
you're gonna do the burial.

1612
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:27.530
And when that's over,

1613
01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.690
let a little bit of more time go by.

1614
01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:39.030
Give yourself another week
of Washington around

1615
01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:43.320
of feeling that sorrow of letting the waves

1616
01:37:45.730 --> 01:37:47.410
toss you around in the ocean.

1617
01:37:51.150 --> 01:37:54.870
But after another week,
what you do is you go and you write a,

1618
01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:59.670
you write a letter to your child.
When you explain to them,

1619
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:07.760
explain to them how much they meant to you.

1620
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:15.790
Explain to them how heartbroken you are that they are gone.

1621
01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:21.520
And then explain to them why you are going to carry on,

1622
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:30.200
why you are going to keep going
with them in your heart.

1623
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:38.890
Explain to them why you're not going to dwell in their loss

1624
01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:50.460
and explain to them how in losing them you have learned without a shred of doubt

1625
01:38:52.090 --> 01:38:55.030
how truly precious life is,

1626
01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:58.790
and that they have taught you

1627
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:06.910
the immeasurable value of your own life and your wife's life and your family's

1628
01:39:07.701 --> 01:39:08.534
life.

1629
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:18.720
And explain to them that you know

1630
01:39:21.650 --> 01:39:26.650
that you know that they loved you and that you know that they would want more

1631
01:39:27.231 --> 01:39:32.231
than anything for you to be happy and productive and impactful in the world.

1632
01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:40.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1633
01:39:41.170 --> 01:39:43.200
<v 0>Then explain it in that letter,</v>

1634
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:48.290
what you will do to make them proud of how you live your life,

1635
01:39:55.910 --> 01:40:00.890
and then take that letter
and go to their grave

1636
01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:05.590
and read it to them

1637
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:09.893
and cry

1638
01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.250
and kiss their soul

1639
01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:21.070
and tell them that you'll see them on the other side

1640
01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:27.123
and then

1641
01:40:29.230 --> 01:40:32.110
go live your life.

1642
01:40:34.810 --> 01:40:36.310
And those waves are still gonna come

1643
01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:41.080
and they're still going to be pain and they're still going to be sorrow,

1644
01:40:45.230 --> 01:40:48.770
but you go and live your life and live it well

1645
01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:55.470
and make them proud.

1646
01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:08.350
And I think that's

1647
01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:14.240
all I've got for

1648
01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:16.613
<v 1>tonight.</v>

1649
01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:23.573
So

1650
01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:34.650
go
ahead,
ma.

1651
01:41:37.410 --> 01:41:39.150
<v 3>Yeah.
Like something like that.</v>

1652
01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.313
<v 1>He's like,</v>

1653
01:41:43.110 --> 01:41:44.970
<v 3>it doesn't always have to be like with,
you know,</v>

1654
01:41:44.971 --> 01:41:48.000
losing a child that can be losing anyone.
Yeah,
for sure.

1655
01:41:48.810 --> 01:41:49.643
<v 1>Like,</v>

1656
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:54.320
<v 3>uh,
my wife had,
uh,
you know,
she lost someone that she was close to whatever.</v>

1657
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:56.800
So even if you're not in the,

1658
01:41:56.870 --> 01:42:00.830
or if you're in a situation where someone's close to you,
like lost someone,

1659
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:02.990
it's good to keep like something like this in mind,
you know,

1660
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:04.910
that it's going to come and go.
You know,

1661
01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:10.820
cause it's easy to be like,
Oh yeah,
like,
oh yeah,
they're over it,
you know,

1662
01:42:10.821 --> 01:42:13.780
so it's Kinda cool now.
And then it comes back and you're like,
wait,
wait,

1663
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:16.610
I thought you were over it kind of thing.
Like he can't.
Yep.

1664
01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:21.090
<v 0>That's an unfortunate lesson I've learned is yeah,</v>

1665
01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:25.270
there's just that.
Yeah.
And you think it's,

1666
01:42:25.271 --> 01:42:30.130
it's a really great description of what it feels like.
It feels like waves.

1667
01:42:30.131 --> 01:42:32.910
If you surf or you've been in the ocean and,

1668
01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.700
and we've been getting hit by waves and like there's nothing you can do when

1669
01:42:36.701 --> 01:42:37.540
that wave hits you,

1670
01:42:37.541 --> 01:42:40.350
you're going to do what that wave wants you to do for little while.
Yeah.

1671
01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:44.470
And sometimes when it's bad,
like you're gonna get hit with a wave wave wave,

1672
01:42:44.471 --> 01:42:47.380
you can barely even tell you could come up for breath.
You're getting hit again.

1673
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:50.910
Yeah.
And that's what it feels like.
It feels like.
And,

1674
01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:53.770
and the other weird thing is you can be,

1675
01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.850
you can go from one extreme emotion to another.
It in a minute,

1676
01:42:58.330 --> 01:43:01.830
you can be laughing and that laughter can trigger,
uh,

1677
01:43:02.110 --> 01:43:05.680
thoughts that make you sad and you get hit with a wave.
Yeah.

1678
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:10.690
And one thing,
and I think this is important,
is that

1679
01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.020
<v 1>okay,</v>

1680
01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.910
<v 0>you knew,
you know,
when I've talked about like the,</v>

1681
01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:18.850
the person that's in a turmoil in their heads,
in a cloud of like a storm cloud.

1682
01:43:18.851 --> 01:43:22.180
And no matter where they look,
they,
they just can't see.

1683
01:43:22.181 --> 01:43:24.850
They don't see that there's a way out to anyone that's standing on the outside

1684
01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:27.610
can see like,
no,
come on,
just walk over here.

1685
01:43:27.611 --> 01:43:30.040
Just just get away from that storm cloud.
You can do it.

1686
01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.380
But when they're standing in the middle of,

1687
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:32.380
they don't even know which way to walk.

1688
01:43:32.381 --> 01:43:36.160
So they just stand there and they just sit in a storm cloud and they think that

1689
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:37.390
they're never going to get out.
And it's the,

1690
01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:40.960
it's the initial feeling after losses,
like,
oh,

1691
01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:43.390
this isn't gonna go away.

1692
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:47.350
And what I'm telling you is it's going to,

1693
01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.040
and there's a certain level of guilt of like,
wait a second,

1694
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.860
how can I be not thinking about it?

1695
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:58.640
I just didn't think about this person for five minutes.
I,
I'm a,
I'm horrible.

1696
01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:02.430
It's like,
no,
you have to process this.
Yeah.

1697
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:06.140
And no one wants you to dwell on this.
No one,

1698
01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:10.040
they never want you to forget,
but they don't want you to dwell as well.

1699
01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:14.600
There's a dichotomy in that
and that that's why,
you know,

1700
01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:17.240
obviously it's heartbreaking to get that note,

1701
01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:23.980
but hopefully you know that that recognition that those waves are going to

1702
01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.680
subside eventually.
There,
Stu,
you're still gonna get hit with some of them,
but

1703
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:36.510
they are,
and it's okay that you're going to that,

1704
01:44:36.511 --> 01:44:38.450
that they're not going to be there.
Yeah.

1705
01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.840
Rough.
Yeah,
man.
For sure.

1706
01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.420
But you know,
when I,
when I wrote [inaudible] Mike and the dragons,

1707
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:56.300
I,
I have the,
you know,
the king dies.
Yeah.
Right.

1708
01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.250
The king you,
you don't know him,
but the king is dead.
Yeah.

1709
01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:02.100
And there are certain people,
you know,
I figured if I,

1710
01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.680
if I actually thought to myself like,
well,
do I really want to talk about death?

1711
01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:08.000
Right.
And there's also,

1712
01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:10.320
there's a couple of lines with a dragon to want to kill you.
You know,

1713
01:45:10.321 --> 01:45:13.750
the dragon's want to kill,
right?
Yeah.
There's a couple times was thinking,
well,

1714
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.850
do it,
you know,
this is a kids' book,
but here's the deal.

1715
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:22.250
There's little kids that's parents dies that grandparents die.
I mean those,

1716
01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:27.280
the death is a real death is 100% part of life and you gotta learn,

1717
01:45:28.130 --> 01:45:30.850
you gotta learn how to deal with that.
Yeah.
Or else there's going to be a,

1718
01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:35.120
you know that,
and I'm not saying you got to dive into it with a little kid.

1719
01:45:35.150 --> 01:45:38.150
Right.
But you have to at least they have to hear the word.

1720
01:45:38.151 --> 01:45:39.950
They have to understand that that's a reality.

1721
01:45:40.050 --> 01:45:44.870
<v 3>Yeah.
So yeah.
That's good.
Oh my God.</v>

1722
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:49.170
This video is like yesterday or the day before that,
my wife took him,
my son,

1723
01:45:49.171 --> 01:45:52.470
he had a dragon costume on.
It's too,
by the way.

1724
01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:57.390
And he's like,
oh I'm going to go kill Daddy.
It was like Whoa,
kill.

1725
01:45:57.391 --> 01:45:58.650
Like where did he even kind of,

1726
01:45:58.950 --> 01:46:03.950
and it's the reason I bring that up cause the dragons that are ready to kill,

1727
01:46:04.351 --> 01:46:07.140
right?
Yes.
That's from the wine making the dragon.

1728
01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:11.340
Cause that's kind of how you feel.
You know,
even though you don't know as a kid,

1729
01:46:11.341 --> 01:46:12.570
however old,
whatever,

1730
01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:17.760
you don't know what the magnitude of that is.
But you know,
you know like,
well,

1731
01:46:17.761 --> 01:46:20.200
what are you scared of?
The whatever the unknown.
Sure you're,

1732
01:46:20.370 --> 01:46:23.490
but you're scared of the monster in the closet.
Why are you scared of him?

1733
01:46:23.491 --> 01:46:27.150
Not because he's going to bore you to death with bad jokes or like he's going to

1734
01:46:27.151 --> 01:46:29.700
kill you.
That's what you're scared of.
You know,
kind of thing has,

1735
01:46:29.701 --> 01:46:34.200
even if you're six years old kind of thing.
So yeah,
man may make sense for sure.

1736
01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:39.460
<v 0>Even think about what you kill a bug,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1737
01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:42.790
Like a little kid get,
they kill a bug there eating a chicken.

1738
01:46:43.150 --> 01:46:45.720
The chicken was alive and now it's dead.
You're eating it right.

1739
01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:49.800
The death is a real thing and you have to,
you have to,

1740
01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:53.640
you have to deal with it.
You know?
And like I said,

1741
01:46:53.970 --> 01:46:56.190
we don't have a great protocol.
And I know we talked,

1742
01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.130
we joked about making a protocol for breaking up with a girlfriend.

1743
01:46:59.510 --> 01:47:03.600
A little bit more lighthearted for sure.
But I'll tell you what,

1744
01:47:04.170 --> 01:47:07.800
hey look,
you talk about lighthearted,
breaking up with a girlfriend.

1745
01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:13.040
Think about the tragic situations you've seen unfold from somebody breaking up

1746
01:47:13.261 --> 01:47:18.150
with their girlfriend or breaking up with her boyfriend.
Yeah,
it's horrible.

1747
01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:22.890
And there should be a protocol and there should be a protocol for,
hey,

1748
01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:26.310
lost a loved one.
Here's the protocol,
here's what I'm going to do.

1749
01:47:26.490 --> 01:47:28.530
And you know what part of that protocol should be,

1750
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:31.560
you write a letter to that person and you explain what I just said.

1751
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:35.790
That is a real,
uh,

1752
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.720
that,
that will clear a lot out of you.

1753
01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.810
It will bring you in touch with that person again.

1754
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:46.970
It'll give you permission from them to,

1755
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:52.200
to go and do what you're supposed to do.
You have to,
they want that,
you know,

1756
01:47:52.201 --> 01:47:53.034
they want that.

1757
01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:58.310
<v 3>Yeah.
Cause I'm like,
it kind of feels like,
Hey,
I'm going to go,
I dunno,</v>

1758
01:47:58.330 --> 01:48:02.410
I'm going to go back to school or something like that.
It's kind of like,
Whoa,

1759
01:48:02.411 --> 01:48:05.350
how can you think of what my back to school when you're,
you know,
when you,

1760
01:48:05.710 --> 01:48:08.560
when this just happened kind of thing.
That's what you feel like,
you know?

1761
01:48:09.010 --> 01:48:13.310
But yeah,
on the other side is kind of like,
no.
Yeah.
That would,
that's what,

1762
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:17.470
that's what they would want you to do kind of thing.
It doesn't feel like that.

1763
01:48:17.471 --> 01:48:20.530
But when you kind of step back and be like,
wait,
it does kind of feel like that,

1764
01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.650
you know,
if you can see,
just see fit to see it that way.

1765
01:48:25.090 --> 01:48:29.020
<v 0>Rough.
Well to those out there,
eh,
um,</v>

1766
01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:34.600
stay strong.
Yeah.
Live your life.
Cool.

1767
01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:38.710
Well we can talk about origin.
You know,
it is a rough transition.

1768
01:48:38.970 --> 01:48:43.780
There's bear with me talking about living and living well,
we want to live well.

1769
01:48:43.810 --> 01:48:48.310
Yeah.
We want to move forward.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1770
01:48:49.150 --> 01:48:49.983
So

1771
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:54.440
<v 3>is Jujitsu party your life?
That's a question you can ask.
Just there's no way.</v>

1772
01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:58.400
There's no good way to do that.
I know.
And just saying,
Hey,
okay.

1773
01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.410
Origin origin,
main.com.

1774
01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.310
This is where you get your gear if you still need a gate or if you want a new

1775
01:49:03.311 --> 01:49:06.710
geek,
go ahead and get it from origin.
It's the best.
They're the best.

1776
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:08.030
And they're made in America.

1777
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:11.840
They're not necessarily the best because they're made in long term venture
there.

1778
01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:16.610
No,
I'm telling you and reminding myself why I really like origin geese.
Shit.

1779
01:49:16.630 --> 01:49:18.020
It just busted one out the other day.

1780
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:21.290
<v 0>No,
I was thinking you're really going for it.
You're like,
okay,</v>

1781
01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:24.620
when I was thinking as you were doing that,
I was like,
Hey,

1782
01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:27.560
I'm sitting here telling people like,
hey,
sometimes you gotta you know,

1783
01:49:27.561 --> 01:49:31.430
you got to move on.
And we were literally having our time moving on,

1784
01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:34.970
just simply talking about this,

1785
01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:38.420
talking about the loss of a loved one and you're just like,
okay,

1786
01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:43.310
we're gonna move on.
Well,
and you just laughed.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1787
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:47.140
I'm saying that in a positive way.
Like you got to,
yeah.

1788
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:50.290
Well this situation,
you know,

1789
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:54.430
you got me talking about [inaudible] and just trained yesterday.
So it's like,

1790
01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:58.030
you know,
you kind of get a feeling good.
I feel good about that one.
It's true.

1791
01:49:58.210 --> 01:50:02.170
Yes.
Which is what did you do to does by the way.
Yeah.
And that's,

1792
01:50:02.171 --> 01:50:06.160
that's another thing.
It's like you gotta move on.

1793
01:50:07.730 --> 01:50:09.580
You got it.
You got,
you're going to go through a rough transition.

1794
01:50:09.581 --> 01:50:12.840
But like you said,
you got to look at your kid and be like,
okay,
we,

1795
01:50:12.850 --> 01:50:17.530
you've got to go back to school.
But what about,
you know,
what about my sister?

1796
01:50:17.531 --> 01:50:21.040
What about my brother?
What about grandma or whatever?
Whoever died.
Yeah.

1797
01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:26.630
That's part of life is death.
And we got to move on.
We're going to go.
Yeah.

1798
01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:31.000
And then they're going to reference Echo Charles Transition.

1799
01:50:31.001 --> 01:50:35.300
A rough transition to talking about Jujitsu keys.

1800
01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.250
All right,
but you see this,
I'm smiling,
so you know what I mean?

1801
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:40.720
It's a positive thing.
Yes.

1802
01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:45.730
You're bringing me out that the reason we started doing the,
the,

1803
01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:49.870
the long extended support was to kind of decompress.

1804
01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.450
I remember there was some,
the first time,

1805
01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:56.860
I think it might've been a podcast number 12 now.
No it wasn't.

1806
01:50:57.230 --> 01:51:01.090
I don't know what podcast it was,
where I was like I need a break.
Yeah.

1807
01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:04.060
I just need to be like,
you need to talk for a little while,

1808
01:51:04.061 --> 01:51:08.790
but said something stupid and lighthearted.
Thanks for yeah,
no,

1809
01:51:08.791 --> 01:51:13.690
that's a compliment.
No,
it's not a compliment.
Especially Nike.
You just to talk.

1810
01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:17.610
But that was the reason.
Yeah.
Cause there's no way to refer.

1811
01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:19.040
How do you transition.
Yeah.

1812
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:24.580
And the other thing you don't want to do is just close on that note.

1813
01:51:24.581 --> 01:51:28.240
Turn off and leave.
That's not cool.
Yeah.
So there's,

1814
01:51:28.450 --> 01:51:33.450
there's plenty of people that say thank you for going through the transition and

1815
01:51:35.411 --> 01:51:39.760
then guilt doing something a little more lighthearted at the end of the podcast.

1816
01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:41.800
Yeah.
So it makes sense.

1817
01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:47.280
I support that and we carry on with that tradition that your dish,

1818
01:51:47.950 --> 01:51:50.830
the rough transition.
I'm on board.

1819
01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:56.270
<v 3>Cool.
So back,
did you get to the feel a solid,
good,
solid,</v>

1820
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:59.780
you know,
train yesterday thought about origin the whole time

1821
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:00.833
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1822
01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:04.990
<v 3>got after it.
And then the last,
even when you geek or a rash guard,</v>

1823
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:09.250
go to origin mean.com they have some other cool stuff on there as well.
Joggers,

1824
01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.113
if you're into it,

1825
01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:14.220
<v 0>tee shirts,
if you're into it.
Supplements</v>

1826
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:20.310
<v 3>that you need to get into.
And this is why.
So krill oil could joints.</v>

1827
01:52:20.311 --> 01:52:24.480
Krill oil,
super.
A krill is what it's called,
joint warfare.

1828
01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:29.920
<v 0>Discipline.
Discipline.
Go discipline.</v>

1829
01:52:29.921 --> 01:52:33.070
Go milk.
All right,

1830
01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:38.080
discipline.
Go.
I'll tell you two minutes.
No,
I'll tell you the 30 seconds.

1831
01:52:38.170 --> 01:52:43.030
True discipline,
cognitive and physical enhancer drink.
Right?

1832
01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:46.180
Sure.
I really like it.
I liked

1833
01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:49.940
<v 2>the way it makes me feel I for living,</v>

1834
01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:54.680
one of my jobs is to go out and talk to companies and talk about leadership and

1835
01:52:54.681 --> 01:52:58.190
getting the game and do podcasts.
Like I gotta get,
you know,
mentally in the game.

1836
01:52:58.280 --> 01:52:59.870
Yes.
But going on,

1837
01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:03.920
talking to a company where I'm gonna be up on stage for two hours.

1838
01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:09.410
If I'm pounding some drink beforehand,
guess what's going to happen?

1839
01:53:09.411 --> 01:53:12.560
You know,
48 minutes in,
I gotta use the restroom.

1840
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:17.060
I don't like to use the restroom.
That's a sign of weakness.
So I talked to Pete,

1841
01:53:17.061 --> 01:53:17.960
Brian,
I was like,
hey,

1842
01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.250
we need to take Watson disciplined and put it in a pill so I can just eat it

1843
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.950
and,
and don't have to use the restroom.

1844
01:53:24.951 --> 01:53:27.140
48 minutes after I started talking to a company.

1845
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:29.420
That's where discipline go came and it's awesome.

1846
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:33.920
And not to mention you don't got to do the whole,
which I don't mind by the way.

1847
01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:37.910
I do like the ritual,
but the whole in the water in the mix and the whatever,

1848
01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:41.810
you know all that stuff.
If you're on the go there.
Yeah,
there you go.

1849
01:53:41.811 --> 01:53:45.290
That's why I discipline go and,
and we actually,
speaking of mixing,

1850
01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:46.310
we are going to,
we have a,

1851
01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:50.450
we have discipline in a can coming out,

1852
01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:56.460
which you won't have to mix.
You'll just crack it open bracket,
fit,
fit,

1853
01:53:57.450 --> 01:54:01.220
kind of.
And then mark of course,
if you need additional protein,
this lady get it.

1854
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:06.320
Best Way to get it most pleasurable into the most delicious way to get a

1855
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:08.630
delicious way to get it in.

1856
01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:13.610
I think a Ribeye has is an equally delicious,
although it's different,

1857
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:14.860
cause I'm telling you this,

1858
01:54:14.861 --> 01:54:18.680
this makes me mad when I'm on the road and I'd go get a nice Ribeye and I'm

1859
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:22.710
totally happy,
but I'm not,
I'm not totally happy.
I'm really,

1860
01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:25.640
I'm 96% happy,
but I want,

1861
01:54:26.530 --> 01:54:29.560
I want a little and a little,
you know,

1862
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:34.660
just to kind of close the deal on my palette and I want something tasty.

1863
01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:39.820
Yeah.
What do they call it?
Savory.
My wife,
you say you do,
that's like salty,
right?

1864
01:54:39.930 --> 01:54:42.200
Oh,
what's like some sweet?
Yeah.

1865
01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.720
Have the savory Ribeye and then I'm going to close the deal with a little bit of

1866
01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:53.000
don't.
Well,
if you were like,
Hey,
I want some additional protein,

1867
01:54:53.150 --> 01:54:55.850
you don't go rebuy it because Ribeye,
you get additional protein,

1868
01:54:55.851 --> 01:54:58.940
additional whatever else,
nutrients in that,
which is cool.

1869
01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:03.780
But if you just want additional protein,
more isolated will say,
yeah,

1870
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:08.100
boom.
Get the milk plus the sleep.
The pleasure for the pallets.

1871
01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:13.370
And if you've got kids and it's hard.
Look,
we got a problem in America.

1872
01:55:13.371 --> 01:55:16.520
I'll just throw it out there.
We've got kids that are just not eating correct.

1873
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:20.210
They're out of shape.
Yeah.
So,
so what do you do?

1874
01:55:20.690 --> 01:55:23.300
What you want to get him?
Something that tastes good to eat?

What tastes good to eat?
Candy bars.
What else tastes good to eat?
Ice Cream.

1876
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:32.090

Those are all bad for you.

1877
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.060
Go guess what else tastes good to eat?

1878
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:40.460
Warrior Kid Mohawk Warrior.
Get milk to drink.

1879
01:55:40.461 --> 01:55:44.100
Would you say,
would you say eat,
drink to drink?
But I mean,
yeah,

1880
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:46.990
if you mix it thick,
you got yourself a little maps.

1881
01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.790
Basically food,
put some coconut shards,

1882
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:57.480

that's all this stuff,

1884
01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:04.890
all of that stuff.
But we do have a store,

1885
01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:09.891
we have a store Jocko store chocolate store.com if you want to represent the

1886
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:15.921
path where some shirts more indicative directly to the path Jocko stored up

1887
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:21.420
comp,
get after it.
Discipline equals freedom.
I was at 24 fitness.

1888
01:56:21.421 --> 01:56:25.600
I go there to lift sometimes,
maybe once or twice a week trainer.

01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:34.080
By the way,
a firefighter up in San Bernardino,
Yak.
He lifts up his shirt.

1891
01:56:34.081 --> 01:56:35.910
You know,

He lifts it up,

1892
01:56:35.970 --> 01:56:40.740
get after it and sit down.

I mean they'll know what I'm saying.

Yeah.

1896
01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:03.030
If you want to see,

a subtle way,

1897
01:57:04.170 --> 01:57:08.040
this t shirt that I'm wearing right now can only be beat,

1898
01:57:08.130 --> 01:57:10.120
can only be PID,

1899
01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.480
positively identified by someone that's completely in the game.

As you wear it and you're like,
hmm,

1901
01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:25.080
I'm a reasonable reason.
I got no reason to tell anybody what's up.
I know.

1902
01:57:25.081 --> 01:57:29.880
What's up def core check also plus truckers.

Equal.
Don't,

1905
01:57:38.311 --> 01:57:41.610
don't discriminate against the flex fit.
They're equal.
Also.

1910
01:57:55.891 --> 01:58:00.620
But if you'd like to Caep is,
it's super steep.
Steep.
Yeah.

1911
01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:05.750
We're sure about this is seper word seeping out of linking.

1912
01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:11.910
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we're not leaking or snow being steep.
Steep,

1913
01:58:11.911 --> 01:58:15.530
like a steep hill.
There's,
yeah.
Multiple Meanings.
Samey,
same work.

1914
01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:19.980
And last if you'd like to steep the,
well,
what do you call the dry?

1915
01:58:20.070 --> 01:58:23.580
The bags.
I don't know the terminology,
but the tea bag.
It's good.

1916
01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:28.020
Teabag in the deal.
Yeah.
Cold,
hot,
whatever.
Anyway,
and you deadlift 8,000 pounds.

1917
01:58:28.050 --> 01:58:31.050
Yeah,
it's true.
I know.
I just added that as like a little thing,

1918
01:58:31.110 --> 01:58:34.710
but it's a big deal.

Youtube is where you can see this video of this podcast and then you can see

1931
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:32.070
cool videos from Echo Charles that he makes on his computer thing and you can

1932
01:59:35.141 --> 01:59:40.141
check his style and give him feedback if he went too far.

1933
01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:47.440
I think there's,
there's some videos that violate good tastes.

1934
01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:51.010
There's only one really only a couple of it is Christmas.

1935
01:59:51.130 --> 01:59:54.830
Don't Christmas is coming up.
I'm going to read it.

1936
01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:59.550
At least I'm going to repost it.
I'm going to remind everyone is that still live?

1937
01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:02.290
It's live video.
In fact,

1938
02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:05.380
people have been contacting me and say they appreciate it.
Or is that war?

1939
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:09.200
It's a war path.
Is it called the war panel?
Christmas videos called the war path.

1940
02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.830
You need to into junk or what's the other one called?

1941
02:00:11.831 --> 02:00:15.050
Revised mean cause then you made a good one,
uh,

1942
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:18.830
one without one with different music,

1943
02:00:18.831 --> 02:00:23.370
some slight variation.
Anyway,
thanks for you know,

1944
02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:26.580
saying that nonetheless.
Well,

1945
02:00:26.590 --> 02:00:29.110

1946
02:00:33.650 --> 02:00:37.240

1947
02:00:37.241 --> 02:00:40.320

1948
02:00:40.330 --> 02:00:43.870

more than kind of help you a lot.

1949
02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:47.650
100% proven by echo.
Whose has moments of weakness?

1950
02:00:47.651 --> 02:00:49.820
I have moments for sure he overcomes them.
Yes.

1951
02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.210
Especially with the stuff you're talking about.
I mean,
yeah,

1952
02:00:53.230 --> 02:00:57.400
not so much with the eating donuts thing,
but like waking up or getting up.

1953
02:00:57.401 --> 02:01:02.320
Like you know,
that's a,
I have a deep history waking up.

1954
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:05.740
If I don't have to wake up for somebody specific,
like you know,
you'll be like,

1955
02:01:05.741 --> 02:01:10.741
hey I got to get up cause I got gotta I can't even remember what it's like to

1956
02:01:10.871 --> 02:01:15.871
have my why's opened up in the morning and not feel the defier not,

1957
02:01:18.130 --> 02:01:18.880
I'm not talking,

1958
02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:21.810
I'm not talking like I'm not trying to say I wake up in the morning,

1959
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:23.500
I have this internal fire.

1960
02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:28.020
I'm talking about the heat from external sources of thanks,

1961
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:29.200
I got it new.
Right.

1962
02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:34.900
So I'm going to get you the connoisseur of comfort.

1963
02:01:34.901 --> 02:01:38.840
Echo Charles this often wake up and say,
hmm,
Yup.

1964
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:42.260
<v 3>So you know,
all is good.</v>

1965
02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:49.010
Well,
thanks for helping me.
How about that?
And skipping workouts too.

1966
02:01:49.011 --> 02:01:53.400
Thanks for helping me with that.
Not skipping postponing.
That's the problem.

1967
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:58.160
Postponing workouts.
No,
that's psycho thing.
I'm just gonna.

1968
02:01:58.310 --> 02:02:01.940
I'm just gonna not do it.
If you don't do a workout that doesn't get postponed.

1969
02:02:01.941 --> 02:02:05.930
It just got skipped.
No Ban.
No wall yet.
No,
he does get postponed because look,

1970
02:02:05.931 --> 02:02:09.140
if I'm going to do x movement,
this,
you know,
if I'm going to do that,

1971
02:02:09.141 --> 02:02:12.170
you know and I'm going to run it as it happened the same day.
No.
Okay,
then,

1972
02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:15.320
then you lost it.
It's going to have it kicking it back.
Okay.
Get it.
Actually,

1973
02:02:15.321 --> 02:02:18.560
you're right,
because look,
my workout goes day one,
day two,
day three,
day four,

1974
02:02:18.561 --> 02:02:22.580
day five.
Like in Dave is,
it's by day is what I'm saying.

1975
02:02:22.610 --> 02:02:26.150
So if I skip when you make a book of your workout,
how's that?
Yeah,
I have.

1976
02:02:26.151 --> 02:02:28.910
I have all the,
everything I have.
I made it long time ago.

1977
02:02:28.911 --> 02:02:32.720
I used to get into the name of the book.
It's going to be out to get chairs

1978
02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:38.360
with seven A's in the Jack.
All right.

1979
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:41.760
Who's not going to buy that?
How give Jack Charles?
Nobody.

1980
02:02:41.761 --> 02:02:46.040
Everyone was going to buy it.
It apparently it's nonetheless kettle bell curls.

1981
02:02:46.041 --> 02:02:49.460
Back to barbell curls,
sandbag curls.

1982
02:02:49.461 --> 02:02:53.330
You do day two on day three,
you skip day two.
You went to date three.

1983
02:02:53.331 --> 02:02:55.620
Just cause you're reformulated the movements on day three.

1984
02:02:55.621 --> 02:02:59.420
It doesn't negate the fact that you've skipped.
It's one of was skipping work.

1985
02:02:59.430 --> 02:03:01.550
I'm just keeping running.
You won't do it anymore.
Psychologic warfare.

1986
02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:03.170
Also speaking of workouts,

1987
02:03:03.710 --> 02:03:07.310
improve very up your workout with on it stuff.

1988
02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.130
Put on it.com/jockey for kettle bells.
So it was on the yes Dave for yesterday.

1989
02:03:12.131 --> 02:03:16.460
Not yesterday.
Got some socks and some other cool items.

1990
02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:17.390
I need a rope though.

1991
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:19.320
<v 0>Get One.
I will.</v>

1992
02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:24.030
And if you're getting things and get a book called Mikey and the dragons,

1993
02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:26.010
how's it being reviewed in your fam

1994
02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.940
<v 3>reviewed?
Yeah.
What's this?
What's the like is a good,
yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1995
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.450
Well my daughter uses uh,
lines

1996
02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:36.810
<v 0>in the giant.
Yeah.</v>

1997
02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:41.900
Jamie just sent me a video of her daughter getting ready to go get a shot.

1998
02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:46.680
I saw that.
I watched the video with my daughter too.
She can,
we both enjoyed it.

1999
02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:49.470
Yeah,
but talking about you're going to be brave.
Yeah.

2000
02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:53.180
Actually says I'm going to be pretty brave.
Pretty cute.

2001
02:03:53.610 --> 02:03:58.200
I was scared last time but this time I'm going to be brave pretty much

2002
02:04:00.150 --> 02:04:03.210
but she's there.
I mean it's a story of how old she is,

2003
02:04:03.211 --> 02:04:05.520
what she's talking about Mikey and the dragons like you can understand this.

2004
02:04:05.521 --> 02:04:08.910
You can understand that how you can overcome your fears.
Miking the dragons.

2005
02:04:09.630 --> 02:04:12.060
Sorry it was out of stock but we in stock now.

2006
02:04:12.061 --> 02:04:15.300
Boy We got plenty of stock so order one for you.

2007
02:04:15.301 --> 02:04:20.301
Order one for be like Sarah in order 10 be like Andrew Paul and order 20 yeah,

2008
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:28.350
I think it was Sarah was making fun of my math.
The Jocko math is like,

2009
02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:29.640
oh Andrew's going to order one.

2010
02:04:29.641 --> 02:04:32.790
Sarah was going to order one echo order one and when it's really like,
oh,

2011
02:04:32.830 --> 02:04:37.020
Sarah's going to order 10 you wonder why we went out of stock anyway.

2012
02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:40.500
We are fully in stock now.
We will not be out of stock again,

2013
02:04:41.190 --> 02:04:42.780
so Mike in the dragons,

2014
02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:47.280
get some and weigh the warrior kid both way.

2015
02:04:47.281 --> 02:04:48.780
The warrior could one and two.

2016
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:52.770
Number two is called Mark was mission number three is coming out in the spring.

2017
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:56.310
I will get it up for preorder and believe me,

2018
02:04:56.311 --> 02:04:59.220
I understand now why we preorder books.
Yeah,

2019
02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:01.890
I kind of made that mistake with Mike in the dragons.

2020
02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:06.150
You all please preorder when I put it up so that I know how many I'm going to

2021
02:05:06.151 --> 02:05:08.850
print or at least a decent estimate and I'll,

2022
02:05:09.090 --> 02:05:12.180
I'll take Sarah's order and multiply it times 10 times.

2023
02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:17.010
I'll set aside 10 for her and 20 for Andrew Paul and everybody else had ordered

2024
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:20.670
stacks of those books,
so appreciate it.
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

2025
02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:25.080
How to get after it.
New Year's,

2026
02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:30.200
everyone's on their big river was at resolution.
Revolution both.

2027
02:05:30.370 --> 02:05:32.270
Let's do a new year's revolution.
Sure.

2028
02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:36.060
Pose the discipline because you can't just say,
well,

2029
02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:40.200
tomorrow I'm going to go on January 1st.
I'm going to change him know today.

2030
02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:43.880
Between now and then.
I'm going to keep slacking,
you know,
whatever.

2031
02:05:43.930 --> 02:05:47.040
That's kind of what you're saying.
That is what you all way of slacking too.

2032
02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:50.700
You could just get in the game right now.
Um,
extreme ownership.

2033
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:55.790
Obviously reference that a bunch today and get the dichotomy of leadership so

2034
02:05:56.221 --> 02:06:01.221
that you don't just get one perspective and forget about the dichotomy.

2035
02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:06.330
You need the dichotomy.
He knew your world as a leader.

2044
02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:40.260
So you're thinking,
well,
you know,
I'll just,
I'll wait and see.

2045
02:06:44.610 --> 02:06:48.750
We are doing a podcast live,

2046
02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:53.960
live podcasts in New York City January 9th I will post the tickets as soon as

2047
02:06:55.681 --> 02:07:00.600
they're available.
If you haven't seen him yet,
check my,

2048
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:05.360
what is it?
Social media platforms,
Instagram,

2049
02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:07.600
Twitter,
Facebook.

2050
02:07:09.730 --> 02:07:14.190
So you set that date aside.
It's a Wednesday night,
it's in New York City,

2051
02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:19.340
it's in a nice cinema or nice theatre theatre has the red velvet seats,

2052
02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:24.680
right?
Indicative they all,
sometimes people will say like,

2053
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:28.230
did you ever think you'd be a children's author?
Or they'll say like,
hey,

2054
02:07:28.231 --> 02:07:31.800
did you ever think you'd be,
you know,
speaking to groups and I'm always like,

2055
02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:36.490
whatever.
I don't know.
Maybe I like writing,

2056
02:07:37.330 --> 02:07:38.300
but if they said,
hey,

2057
02:07:38.330 --> 02:07:43.150
jurors think you're going to be speaking in a symphony hall with Red Velvet

2058
02:07:43.151 --> 02:07:47.350
seats,
I'd say,
but I am.

2059
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:51.070
And so were you go whether you like it or not.
So there's that.

2060
02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:55.300
Here's something new.
He f online,
[inaudible] online.
So

2061
02:07:57.370 --> 02:08:00.160
I guess I have to explain a little bit.
We have the muster,

2062
02:08:00.190 --> 02:08:05.190
we have the echelon front where we go and work with companies at the muster.

2063
02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:09.310
You travel and you go and it has a pretty high price point.

2064
02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:13.150
Some companies have a lot of people,

2065
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:16.270
some people have smaller budgets.

2066
02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:20.800
As we recognize,
some companies asked us,
hey,

2067
02:08:20.801 --> 02:08:22.570
we want you to train everyone in our company.

2068
02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:27.840
We have 150,000 employees and they're located dispersed around the globe,

2069
02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:33.460
can you get that done for us?
This is one of those things where it's like,
no,

2070
02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:37.620
I can't,
we can't get to 150,000 people in a,
in a,

2071
02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:40.510
in a short enough period of time that it has the impact we want to deliver.

2072
02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:44.980
So with all that,
how do we overcome this barrier?
We go to technology.

2073
02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:48.820
So we've created online leadership training course.

2074
02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.140
It's calledF online.

2075
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:56.090
It's going to be available through direct consumer.
If somebody will just want,

2076
02:08:56.190 --> 02:08:58.900
like for instance,
let's say you can't go to the muster for whatever reason,

2077
02:08:59.710 --> 02:09:04.000
this is a
virtual,

2078
02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:08.560
I guess it's a virtual muster,
uh,
or it's,
it's a sin.

2079
02:09:08.590 --> 02:09:12.490
It's a similar as simulation.
That's not saying,
yeah,
that's what it is.

2080
02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:17.230
That the original idea for me was,
uh,
you go to the monster without having to go.

2081
02:09:17.890 --> 02:09:19.090
You get that information,

2082
02:09:19.450 --> 02:09:23.170
get that interactivity without actually having to go to the muster.

2083
02:09:23.890 --> 02:09:28.090
So there you go.
Yeah.
If online,
and we made it for individuals,

2084
02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:31.000
we also have it for enterprise.
So we're,
we're now getting it.

2085
02:09:31.001 --> 02:09:32.320
We already have it with our clients,

2086
02:09:32.321 --> 02:09:37.321
they're stoked on it and so you have online.com it's going to be available g to
