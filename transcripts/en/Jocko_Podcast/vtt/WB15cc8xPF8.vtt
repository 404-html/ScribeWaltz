00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.560
This is Jocko podcast number one 69 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.230
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.220
And tonight we have a return guest by the name of Jodi Mitak.

4
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:16.800
So before listening to this podcast,

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.830
if you have not listened to podcasts 24 25 and one 11 then go back and listen to

6
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:29.751
those podcasts first so that you can hear about Jody's life growing up,

7
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.360
joining the Canadian army,

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.810
his trials and tribulations in the Canadian army,

9
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:38.850
his successes and his failures,

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.270
how he eventually became a sniper served overseas eventually in Afghanistan

11
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.470
where he was wounded,
badly,

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.890
lost both of his legs but drove on,

13
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.730
became a successful politician in the city of Ottawa and was carrying on with

14
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:02.544
his life.

15
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.450
But things were not as pretty on the inside as they might have appeared on the

16
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:09.751
outside.

17
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:14.751
And when Jodie came back on for podcast one 11 I had a suspicion that things

18
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.560
might not being going that great.

19
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:24.820
There seemed to be something lurking just beneath the surface and

20
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.580
for whatever reason,

21
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.750
and there is no good reason that I can give.

22
00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:33.910
I didn't say anything.

23
00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:38.260
And I actually talked to a couple of my buddies who thought the same thing,

24
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:41.230
who said,
man,
Jody didn't quite sound right on that.

25
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.990
And it was the same thing that I thought it was the same thing that I could

26
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:48.460
sense in my gut.

27
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.480
And my gut was right.

28
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.050
There was more going on behind the scenes.

29
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.090
And Jodi is back today to explain where he's been,

30
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.040
what happened,

31
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.040
how he slipped off the path and how he has gotten back on it.

32
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.100
So,
Jodi,
welcome back.
Thank you brother.

33
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:18.870
And I guess I mean that in more ways than one.
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.
So talk to me Bro.

34
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.110
She,
um,

35
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.300
<v 2>getting wounded sucked and uh,
and you know,
you,
when,</v>

36
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.630
when,
when,
when was I here?
Last
January,

37
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.550
January,
2018,
I think.
Uh,
Kelly and I rolled through Kelly.
Uh,
I wasn't there,

38
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:38.380
but I don't know if anybody can see or here,

39
00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:40.750
but Kelly is my fiance and my best friend.

40
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.460
She's present and she's present and she's always watching on youtube and a,

41
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.020
so as our dog,
Athena.
Um,
but anyway,
yeah,
man,
I,

42
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:50.854
um,

43
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.220
I spent 2007 to 2017 pretending I had prosthetic feet that did I present.

44
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:03.090
It didn't matter.
I guess if I'd had my feet blown off.
And,
um,

45
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.530
Kelly saw what happened,
like at some point,
uh,
after I was elected,

46
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.550
um,
it was,
what was the position you were elected to?
City city counselors.

47
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.150
So I think,
I don't know,
you call them aldermen,
don't hear me.
Um,

48
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.260
and because I had just come off the amazing race Canada,
um,

49
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.380
and I was second place on that,
so I was popular in Canada.

50
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.030
And so that helped me win the election,
but also raise my profile in Canada.

51
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.740
And so they made me the sports commissioner for the city and I was the veterans,

52
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:36.910
a liaison and things like that.
And,
um,

53
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.770
like personal relationship wasn't going that well.
And you know,
things like that.

54
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:45.490
So things in the background,
like you said,
of life,
you know,
everyone says,
oh,

55
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.050
you look like the perfect family,
but you know,
like,
it's,
uh,

56
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.460
what else are you gonna put it on Facebook,
right?
I mean,
that's what it's for.

57
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.870
And uh,
you know,
uh,
we were just going in different directions and that's fine.

58
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.000
So I actually,
uh,
uh,

59
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.930
we actually split up and moved out and fall of 16,

60
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.290
and I found the politics job,
um,

61
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.180
frankly as eager and,
um,
as I was to serve,

62
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.810
because politics,
despite what most people think is service to your country,

63
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.030
most politicians,
uh,
could probably make twice as much money doing other things.

64
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.230
And just like,
like when my book came out and Flinching,
um,

65
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.360
I had that deal in place before I started campaigning.
And I was like,
well,

66
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.710
well,
and also the amazing race,
right?
So I was like,

67
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.390
one of these things will work out.
It turned out,
I,
I got,
I got,
I got,
uh,

68
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.870
you know,

69
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.620
what do you call it and craps where you throw and you get the dice are good.

70
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.870
Seven,
I've got seven with every role.

71
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.490
So the show worked and then the book work and then,
uh,
and then the election,

72
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:53.290
I want it.
So I had all these things to juggle,
you know,
and,
uh,
and when I bought,

73
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.420
when I got elected and I was like happy about it,

74
00:04:55.421 --> 00:05:00.421
cause I was like medically retiring that in 2014 I medically retired and,

75
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.240
uh,
I didn't want to,
of course,
like all soldiers,
right.
We want to carry on.

76
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:08.110
I wanted to train more sniper then more troops.
But anyway,

77
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.420
I'm in service to my country.
Awesome.
And,
uh,
you know,
um,

78
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.530
people tell you something like,
uh,
you know,
going out for the seals,

79
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:21.100
that's not what you see on TV and it's this and that.
And you go,
yeah,
okay.

80
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:23.770
And of course you know that,
but until you're there,

81
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:26.980
there's really no way no one can prepare you for it.
Right.

82
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:30.970
You have to actually live it.
Yeah.
Like sniper school,
you have to go like,

83
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.830
there's no way to prepare unless you do it.
So,
uh,
politics is the same.

84
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.600
And I'm a straight guy and you know,
we are honorable men,
uh,
for the most part.

85
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:44.230
And we do our best to stick to our word and deed and,
and politics.

86
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:48.720
I'm not saying that it's not that,
but there's a whole lot of pretending.
Uh,

87
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.810
and by pretending,

88
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:54.130
I mean you have to say one thing and mean another and you know,

89
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:58.400
it's not necessarily lying,
but it's not necessarily the truth.
And,
and,
uh,

90
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:03.230
the political brinkmanship that is with that job means always holding your cards

91
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.250
very tight.
And,
um,
you know,
and I,
I don't want to,
I'm a,

92
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.730
I'm a combat guy,
you know,
I'm a,
I'm action.
I'm about getting things done and,

93
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.440
and although that worked in a lot of ways for politics and a lot of other ways

94
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:17.450
that it wasn't meshing,
so I had no,

95
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.470
I had a couple of colleagues on council that I,
that I liked and I hung out with.

96
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:25.880
But for the most part,
I didn't have any friends.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

97
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.660
And my soldier,
uh,
brothers and sisters,
they were around,

98
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:34.370
but now I am this guy who's a politician and a bestselling author and I was on

99
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:37.970
amazing race.
So whenever I hung out,
it was like,
Hey,

100
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.970
let's talk about what you're doing.
Me.
And I'm like,

101
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:45.170
can we just talk about the last UFC or hey,
what's going on at the unit?

102
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.820
Or what's the latest equipment acquire,
acquired.
That's cool.
Um,

103
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.690
people are inviting me places.
I'm the guest of honor here and this,
and I'm,

104
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.900
I'm like,
I'm missing just being Jody.
Mm.
Um,
you know,
and,

105
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.410
and it got to a point where I was a,
and then on top of it,

106
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:06.290
my legs were not cooperating.

107
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.060
Like they just didn't want to take the beating of everyday life anymore.
And,

108
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:14.750
uh,
and so I started drinking again and,

109
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.160
and it was drinking to mask the pain mostly,
but also what does that look

110
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.760
<v 0>Gleick when you,
first of all,
how,
how long had you stopped drinking for,</v>

111
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:24.460
or did you,

112
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.960
<v 2>I never stopped drinking,
but I was,
because I got addicted to the opioids.</v>

113
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.440
Pardon me?
Because I got addicted to my oxycotton.

114
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:37.120
I didn't want to take pain meds,
so at the end of a day,
long day,

115
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:41.800
so I'd show up at the office,
usually between six and eight.
Um,
you know,
if,

116
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:44.920
depending on what was going on and what committees I was sitting on or if

117
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:46.540
council,
what meetings and,

118
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.650
and then politics is all about being places to shake hands as well.
And that's,

119
00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:54.580
I love that part,
meeting people,
talking to people.
It's awesome.
I have no,

120
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.820
you know,
uh,
me and the mayor go along and I,
you know,

121
00:07:57.821 --> 00:08:01.840
I get along with the other two levels of government and it was fun and you go

122
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:04.870
places and you represent veterans.
And that's the important thing for me.

123
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.861
And you know,

124
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:08.950
the whole point to get into politics was to be a better representative for my

125
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:11.380
brothers and sisters that are now veterans.

126
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.200
<v 0>Yeah.
Cause I gotta throw this out there where you talked about how when you're a</v>

127
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:18.230
politician,
you're serving your country.

128
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.550
And unfortunately there's a lot of politicians that when they're politicians,

129
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.390
they're serving themselves.
And I'm sure you must've seen that.

130
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:31.160
And I know that's what makes people get that stereotypical negative attitude

131
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:36.161
towards politicians because oftentimes politicians are just looking out for

132
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.590
their best interests and whether that means they're doing things inside their

133
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:46.310
district because they just want to get something for themselves,
like more money.

134
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.520
But,
but oftentimes if they're just doing what they need to do to get reelected,

135
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.250
I was just still self serving.

136
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:56.180
<v 2>Well that's the funny thing with politics is if yourself serving,
hmm.</v>

137
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.300
It's,
it's,
it's a catch 22 what you write and you just,
you just pointed it out,

138
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:04.890
right?
Like if I get reelected,
I can still continue to do this for my community,

139
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.510
but I have to get reelected.

140
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.690
So I do this to get reelected and then I can do this for my community.

141
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.290
It's kind of like that.
Play the game.
Yeah.
It's that a,
your favorite word,

142
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:17.760
the dichotomy of,
of politics.
So,
um,
quite often though,

143
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.530
I found myself,
uh,

144
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.180
like there was one thing where my staff was and it was,
and it's,
you know,

145
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.780
the stupidest things,
uh,
can,
can get you at,
especially at city level,

146
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.100
the hardest level of politics.
And I in Canada anyway,
I don't know about here,

147
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:35.580
but is the city level,
the municipal level because you are,

148
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.750
you are plugged into 90% of most people's daily lives.
Flushing water,

149
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.210
flood our toilets,
flushing water,

150
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:45.480
running nine one one working the dog park w you know,

151
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:48.540
of being cleaned up the grass,
you know,
snow plowed.

152
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:51.510
If you're in Canada here I guess,
uh,
I don't know.

153
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.530
What do you guys have storm drains that may be get plugged now and then potholes

154
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.420
and bottles,
portals,
a huge issue in Ottawa actually.
Um,
uh,

155
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.420
so you know,
it's,
you're always on,
so you go around,
you meet people and so,

156
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.610
you know,
I love that part,

157
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:09.330
but my legs started to just go and so I didn't want to take the pills.

158
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.210
And,
and what causes that?

159
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.890
Is it just I'm rich and beat down on your legs?
Yeah,
well it's like a,
you know,

160
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:20.280
your,
your elbows are designed for,
you know,
certain amount of weight bearing.

161
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.410
Right.
And the skin there and can handle it.

162
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.360
But now try weight bearing on your for,
you know,
uh,
unless you really work at it.

163
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.403
You know,
uh,

164
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.950
and even then the skin there will never take weight like your elbows will.

165
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.050
And that's what happens with,
with prosthetics and with amputation and,
and so,

166
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:37.884
um,

167
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.970
I was also wearing my legs and a what's called a suction with a suction system.

168
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.240
And so what that is,
is the,
the liner around my,

169
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:50.220
that I put over my leg before I put them into the socket has like a gasket and

170
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:55.050
it pushes the air route.
Uh,
and it's a one way valve.
And so then it's like,

171
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.430
and so it's a vacuum,
right?

172
00:10:56.431 --> 00:11:01.431
And so that vacuum was constantly pulling on the leg and for most people have no

173
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:04.800
issue,
but for whatever reason,
um,

174
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.210
and I looked around and I realized that most double below knee amputees use a

175
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:12.330
sleeve.
So now I use a sleeve,
but at the time,

176
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.860
cause every layer is that much more a dexterity lost in the movement of your

177
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:20.640
knee.
Your odd.
Right.
And I'm like,
I think I was telling an echo before the show.

178
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.870
Like,
I've,

179
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.080
I've done things with prosthetics that most of the guys that make them are like,

180
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:27.240
I've never seen anybody break it this way.
Like,

181
00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:30.450
or I've never seen this type of damage or like you did what?
Like,

182
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:32.700
you're not supposed to do these things,
but as a double amputee.

183
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.300
And so I just wanted to most mobility possible,

184
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.920
but I was actually losing mobility because of the pain that I was putting myself

185
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:45.750
through.
So my bought my skin just couldn't handle that constant suction.
And so,

186
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:49.050
um,
so I was drinking,
you know,
I tough it out,

187
00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:51.960
grit my teeth and at the end of the day we'd go to the pub next to city hall,

188
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:56.950
have a few drinks,
talk some politics and usually I'm the last one there.
And,

189
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.270
and then like,
you know,
did it escalate to that?
Where,

190
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.080
where he like,
oh yeah,
we're going to have a couple of drinks.
And then it's like,

191
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.050
oh yeah,
a couple of drinks and most people are gone.
That's all.
I'm still fine.

192
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.080
And then eventually you look around and you're like,
oh,
I'm the last person here.

193
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.840
Oh,
it's been three weeks since I've been the last person here.

194
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.600
It was like three months.
Yeah,
it was six months.
And then like,

195
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.760
and I was known now,
you know,
and then in city count,

196
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:22.630
like the insight politics of,
of City Hall was Jody,
you know,

197
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:25.870
if you want a party called Jody,
you know,
or if our,
where's Jody at?

198
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:29.380
That's where the fun is.
And you know,
and I'm not saying like,
it was like crazy,

199
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.140
uh,
things that you see on a house of cards or anything like that.

200
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:36.280
But if there was an event,
I was there,
you know,
and you know,
and again,

201
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:41.200
like for a bit of it was avoiding going home and dealing with that situation

202
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.730
properly.
And then
the more pain I was in and then,
you know,

203
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.040
and then the more pain I'm in the morning I'm drinking,

204
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:50.410
and then the more I'm drinking and then,
um,

205
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.160
you're just putting yourself through more damage,
right?
Like you're out later,

206
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.680
but because you're not feeling it,
you're out later,

207
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.450
then you're causing more damage.
Right.

208
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.400
So I move out fall of 16 and then in spring of 17,
my legs are just,
they're done.

209
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.090
They're just like,
I,
I uh,
I came back,

210
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:10.980
I did this thing in Canada called Canada reads and it's a national thing where

211
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.420
like you,

212
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.310
you read a book and then you try to get it to win the contest and it's a week in

213
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:19.900
Toronto.
And um,
and I did that and I gritted my way through it.

214
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:24.100
And then I got home and I was at my old house with,
with my ex and my kids and,

215
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.950
and uh,
and I took my legs off after,
cause I just,

216
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:30.790
I went there straight from the flight because I wanted to see the girls and I

217
00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:33.070
took my legs off and like she would like my ex,

218
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.960
she was there the night I was wounded and she said that she'd never heard me in

219
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:38.530
the 10 years.

220
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.300
She's known me make those types of paint sounds from pain and cause I took my

221
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:46.190
legs off and it was,
it was just like torture.
Like,

222
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.390
because while you have the pressure on and,
and,

223
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:52.690
and you're using them like a kind of,
you know,
when you sprain an ankle,

224
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:54.310
maybe you know when you go around on it,

225
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.790
but at the end of the day when you get off,
take the weight off,

226
00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:01.390
that's when it really hurts.
Um,
that's basically it would happen.

227
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:04.390
And she was like,
wow,
I've never heard you make those noises.

228
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:08.910
You must be in real pain.
So after that I just couldn't wear my legs anymore.

229
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.680
And that's like,
I mean I saw you almost a year later.

230
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:15.730
I was still in my wheelchair.
Yeah.
How much of that is,

231
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.840
I know you were going hard working hard.
How much of that is,

232
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:21.460
cause you're spending an extra three,

233
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:23.620
four hours a day standing around at the bar drinking.

234
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.510
How much of that is because the damage that alcohol is doing to your system you

235
00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:32.080
oh yeah.
How much of it is self imposed?
A good 50% I'd say.
Yeah.

236
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.060
Yeah.
I mean just getting out of bed and putting the legs on hurt and then,

237
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:38.580
you know,
it's like,
it's like,
again,
when you,

238
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.040
I always go to the ankle because I used to spray in them a lot when I had them

239
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.520
and,
um,
and that sucks as an infantry guy,

240
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:49.900
but I learned how to tape them and I did some exercises but,
but you know,

241
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:52.610
like once getting into your boot or once you're in there though,

242
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:54.920
when you lace it up and you're usually good to go with it,
right?

243
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.100
So that's what I was doing every single morning for like a year.
And,

244
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.410
and then like,
and then,
you know,
I'm just going to say it now,

245
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:07.250
I started abusing cocaine and then to go,
because you know,

246
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:09.830
when you have a few drinks a,
you start to wobble and,

247
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.480
and unfortunately I picked up the habit after my first rotation,
Afghanistan.

248
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.810
It was like,
kind of like,
uh,
seeking that thrill again.
I don't know.

249
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:21.950
I'm sure you've had a lot of troops to tell you this type of thing,
but,
um,
and,

250
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.380
and,
and it goes out of your system.
And a couple of days,

251
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.310
and whereas we'd is there for months at a time,
you know,
and I don't know.
I've,

252
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:32.870
no,
I hadn't,
I hadn't touched anything since like high school.
When my buddies,

253
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:37.190
hot mom sold Hash and me and my other buddy would want to hang out and buy,

254
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.390
I'd buy it.
I never,
I only smoked it like three times,
but anyway,
um,

255
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.950
then you're out even longer and you're still wearing your legs even longer.

256
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.090
And you know,
and any

257
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.080
<v 0>was the,
what was the,
how did you do,
you kind of just said,
oh yeah,</v>

258
00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:56.170
I was drinking and then I was doing some cocaine.
And for me,
that's a big step.

259
00:15:56.171 --> 00:15:59.470
Like,
I mean,
well,
we need to,
because here's the thing,

260
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.100
I want people to understand what opened that door up.

261
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.560
What made you say to yourself,
you know what,
um,

262
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.100
I'm a politician or I'm a wounded vet.
I can do kind of whatever I want.

263
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.640
<v 2>Well,
that was part of it.
Yeah.
Um,
I,
I,</v>

264
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.950
because I had so much success and I was so much,
um,
you know,

265
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.640
it was my name on the,
on the door.
Uh,
you know,
and,
and,
and,

266
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.780
and at first,
like I went in with full intentions of being,

267
00:16:27.781 --> 00:16:32.620
doing the honorable thing and this and,
and being,
being a standup guy.
And,

268
00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:35.280
and I,
I think I was for a lot of part,

269
00:16:35.281 --> 00:16:38.400
but where I started going down is when it was the booze and the,

270
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:42.570
and the coke started to fill in the gaps where I should have been at home or in

271
00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:47.190
the gym or,
or things like I was seeking immediate reward,
you know,

272
00:16:47.191 --> 00:16:50.880
like I would like say a powered through a week of pain and,

273
00:16:50.881 --> 00:16:52.380
and like getting up early and going,

274
00:16:52.381 --> 00:16:55.110
cause I was true right up until I moved out of the house.

275
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.680
Like I was training for a bodybuilding show.
I was looking good as feeling good.

276
00:16:58.681 --> 00:17:02.400
I was going here,
I was going there,
I kind of started feeling arrogant,
you know,

277
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.343
like I,

278
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:08.570
I'm Jody medic and I work my ass off and I'm going to party my ass off this

279
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.690
weekend because I can't.
And then it went from the weekend too.
Okay.

280
00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:16.720
It's Thursday.
Uh,
you know,
and we got no meetings tomorrow at City Hall.

281
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:20.820
So I'm going to sleep in tomorrow because tonight I'm going and there's always

282
00:17:20.821 --> 00:17:21.360
events.

283
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.990
There's always events where you can go and eat and drink and meet people and

284
00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:29.340
look cool.
And,
and I was the guy who had did amazing race,

285
00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:33.590
wrote a book or got wounded in Afghanistan,
powered is way back,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,

286
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.930
got elected.
You know,
like I was always on display.
It felt,
you know,

287
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.590
so when I was allowed to be myself,
I kinda just let loose,
you know,

288
00:17:40.591 --> 00:17:43.470
I'd like light the fuse on the,
on the rocket.
And

289
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:47.190
<v 0>when advising you,
was anyone pulling you aside going,
hey bro,
you know,</v>

290
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.070
<v 2>no,
because I was the man</v>

291
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.400
<v 0>in my world.
I was,
I was in charge.</v>

292
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.360
I like my assistant.
Um,

293
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.400
he tried his best,
but you know,
it's not something like,

294
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.610
um,
like even even killed,
right?
She was around for a little bit.
Like,

295
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:08.550
it's not something you just walk up and go,
Hey Jocko,
you don't fucking sorry.

296
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.660
Hey Jocko,
are you doing coke?
You don't,

297
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:15.840
unless you have that relationship with someone,
you can't just open that door.

298
00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:20.430
Right.
Um,
like it's your door.
You,
are you,
are you jack and needles up your arm?

299
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.670
Like are you doing heroin?
Like you know what I mean?
Like you can't just so,

300
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:28.140
and like I said,
I was the man in my life.
My whole world was like,

301
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:32.520
I was so in charge.
Yeah.
I kind of drank my own koolaid for awhile.

302
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.430
I talk about it.
You go obviously all the time.

303
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:38.250
And one of the things I say when I talk about ego is,

304
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.870
is when you start believing your own hype right now bro,
it's the worst.

305
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.990
And if you put yourself in a position where no one even has the balls to come up

306
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:52.260
to you and say,
Hey,
I think you could do this a little bit differently.

307
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.710
And even if they do or they try to hint at it,

308
00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.300
you kind of steam roll them cause you're the man and this is what that situation

309
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:03.450
is where you aren't looking at yourself thinking,
okay,

310
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.350
what am I really doing right now?
How is this working out well to,

311
00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.510
in my view for a long time?
And it all worked out fine.
Yeah.

312
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.160
Which all that does is solidify your beliefs.
Like you're on the show.

313
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:19.980
You come in second,
but you came in second with no legs.

314
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:24.570
That is pretty much like place right.
Sprinted past a sprinter.

315
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.620
Like that girl,
Selena,
she was a sprinter in high school and I sprinted pastor,

316
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.120
you know,
um,
and I'm,
I'm getting older and you know,
my,
you know,
I'm just,

317
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.040
I was what?
Yeah,
it just,
but when it started being like,

318
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:38.700
it was a,

319
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.630
it was a Saturday night and then it was a weekend and then it was like a four

320
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:46.740
day weekend.
And then next thing I knew I was out because,
you know,

321
00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:50.670
I didn't need to go home.
Uh,
and I saw the kids on the weekends and stuff,

322
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:54.640
so I just,
I was able to manipulate my,
and I'm the boss of my own schedule.

323
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.340
You're manipulating everything,

324
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:58.540
including yourself because you're big nationalizing.

325
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.830
It's so funny because it's not like you don't see this play out over and over

326
00:20:03.961 --> 00:20:06.720
and over again with,
uh,
with famous people,

327
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.680
famous people that all of a sudden they get,

328
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.520
they get a role in a movie or they,
they do something,
they,
they,

329
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.200
they get recruited to a professional sports team and next thing you know,

330
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:22.290
no one can tell them anything and they're going to go and they're going to go

331
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:26.580
hard.
And the other thing that happens is you get surrounded with yes men,

332
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.340
people that are just telling you,
oh yeah,
yeah,
you do whatever you want.

333
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.950
And in my opinion,
a lot of times those,
yes men there,

334
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.810
they're actually digging dirt they're actually possibly do while they're either

335
00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:39.600
trying to hook on to you and get what they can out of you and ride your

336
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:42.630
coattails.
Or there's someone that just looking for,

337
00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:46.200
to make you fall down because they're jealous a hundred percent I was surrounded

338
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:47.890
by both and I'm not,

339
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.530
<v 2>and it,
hey,
if you were around me and you're listening to this,</v>

340
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:51.820
I'm not saying that was you,

341
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.750
but there are some people that might be listening that know exactly what they

342
00:20:55.751 --> 00:21:00.400
were in my life at the time.
And looking back on it,
it's like,
you know,

343
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:02.740
it's like doing a map recky after the,

344
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.320
after the mission or something and then you go,

345
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.620
<v 0>oh,
how did I not see that right there?</v>

346
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:10.720
That object or that obstacle right there.

347
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:13.810
How did I miss that when it's so obvious?

348
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:15.970
So you know I spent,

349
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.360
so I think it's important to like just pause for a second though,

350
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:24.010
because people go into these situations all the time and what you have to do is

351
00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:28.360
you have to be,
you have to do is map study.
Like you're saying,

352
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.240
you have to do a reconnaissance.
You have to look around and say,
hey,

353
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:33.190
maybe I don't know exactly where I am.

354
00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.960
Maybe I need to look for some of these obstacles.

355
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.230
Maybe I need to look for some of these obvious pitfalls that I'm going to look

356
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:42.940
back in five years and I'm going to say,
oh,
that person was a Leech or oh,

357
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.260
I was being an idiot.

358
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.280
Or Oh everyone was fueling the fire so they could get more out of me.

359
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.600
And when,
when that's the way it is.
If you're aware of that,

360
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.460
that you're going to get yourself from that situation.
The problem is,

361
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.150
the problem is you get in that situation,

362
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.020
you're supposed to be self aware but you can't because you're in that situation,

363
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.820
right?
It's a,
it's a catch 22

364
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.730
<v 2>and I've got to tell you,
man,
um,</v>

365
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.880
when you're doing the amount of drinking and then the amount of drugs I was

366
00:22:08.881 --> 00:22:13.300
doing,
it's impossible.
Do your,
your,
your ability to sync objective Lee and,

367
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:18.620
and self like they self awareness dissolves and guys like you and me and at

368
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.250
worst,
you know,
we're warriors were elite,
this and that.

369
00:22:23.251 --> 00:22:25.320
We're supposed to have it all together,
but it's actually,

370
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.490
it's super common in our,
in our,
in our,
uh,
in our community.

371
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.700
And it's because we're so used to being on point.

372
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:38.030
I think for me what happened was I was so used to being on point that it just

373
00:22:38.101 --> 00:22:42.810
never occurred to me.
I was,
and it to occur.
My kids,

374
00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:47.280
even my mom,
my dad,
my brother and my sister,
my assistance,
um,
my,

375
00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:51.930
a couple of good friends,
um,
to kind of just start to turn the ship.

376
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.490
And when I was here last time,
the ship had just barely started to turn.

377
00:22:56.491 --> 00:23:00.370
I had just before we came,
drove down here,
um,

378
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.280
I just quit drinking and,
uh,
at new years,

379
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.700
which was actually pretty easy.
And you know,
I just,

380
00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:12.270
I hadn't used since we tired of the road trip and we saw you like,

381
00:23:12.271 --> 00:23:17.040
I think in the last half of it.
So,
um,
and I felt like,
oh,
I don't,

382
00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:21.930
obviously I'm not addicted.
I,
I can go three weeks or whatever it was.
And um,

383
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:26.990
and so 2017 was the down and then 2018 was a bit of a leveling out.

384
00:23:27.301 --> 00:23:31.860
And then I had a hard crash right before new year's this year or,
yeah,

385
00:23:31.861 --> 00:23:33.420
I guess whatever.
A couple of months ago.

386
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:38.730
And that's when her Kelly and everyone said,
if you don't go to rehab,

387
00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:39.660
you're going to lose it all.

388
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.600
<v 0>I have to back up because I know,
sorry man,</v>

389
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.110
you jumped like you're like oh that are them to crash.
And

390
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.400
<v 2>we're good.
Cause I,
cause what for me,</v>

391
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:52.670
what I want to see is I want to be able to recognize the warning signs better.

392
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.790
Right.
Yeah.
I know.
And I'm,
I'm trying,
I'm,

393
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.310
I'm glossing because you asked me did you get in trouble

394
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.170
with your governmental job,
with your political positions?

395
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:08.270
Did people eventually say,
cause I remember at one point you missed a meeting,

396
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.620
you missed some meetings and,
and all of a sudden it turned into,
hey,

397
00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:16.010
what's this guy's problem?
Yes.
So in politics,
you know,

398
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.030
as much as you're your own boss and you know,
for,
for municipal level,
uh,

399
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.930
in Canada and Ontario because we don't have a party system at that level,

400
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.950
apparently you had your own party.
So stir frys partying.
I,
you know,

401
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.110
I was the party,
um,
uh,
the,

402
00:24:32.111 --> 00:24:34.790
the time when you were earning is when it's budget time.

403
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.200
And that's where you're fighting for your,
you,
you're a community.

404
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.770
Get the dollars that it deserves or the programs,
pardon me,
sorry.

405
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.220
The programs that you believe in,
you're,
you're there to say,

406
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.980
I think that this needs more money or this shift.

407
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.580
That's when you really make your,
make your money or make,

408
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.400
earn your pay as a politician so to,
so to speak.
And,

409
00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:00.410
and I just stopped showing up.
You can mess up the whole year,

410
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.320
but if you're not there for budget,
that's when people started going,
hey man,

411
00:25:03.321 --> 00:25:04.154
what's going on?

412
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.910
And a really good friend of mine who is one of the biggest things,

413
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.570
the biggest meetings of the year,

414
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.880
and I missed important things that you have to do,

415
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.570
the most important things you have to do to represent the community that elected

416
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:18.010
you and you're just not showing up.
I just,
uh,
yeah,

417
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.470
just tell him I won't be there today.
And Mike Assistance is like,
dude,

418
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:24.200
I can't keep covering for you.
You know,
and a good,

419
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.340
a good friend of mine who's also a big political reporter in Canada called me

420
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:32.900
one day and he said,
you need to meet me for lunch or you just,

421
00:25:32.901 --> 00:25:37.250
you like,
you got to say something or else you're going down.
And I was like,
what?

422
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.090
And so I met him for lunch and I didn't really didn't want to.
And,

423
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.160
and he's like,
this is what's gonna be said if you don't say anything.

424
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.140
And he's like,
I'm telling you this as a friend,

425
00:25:48.141 --> 00:25:51.230
I've known you since way before you.
You were Jody Mitic,

426
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.440
I've known you for and I respect you and your,

427
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.630
you've always been straight and you've stopped.

428
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.530
You're not being straight anymore and you're not being honest and you're not

429
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:04.100
answering questions.
And he's like,
this is the world you're in now,
dude.

430
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.990
Like this is how you have to handle it.

431
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.650
And so coming down and doing your show last time was kind of part of that.

432
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.700
Come to Jesus when you want you to do w did you do like a story with that

433
00:26:13.701 --> 00:26:16.220
reporter and say I've been,
you did sort of a,

434
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.870
I'm guilty but I only just told half the story.
Kind of like,

435
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.250
like I was telling you half extreme ownership.
I took half of the ownership,

436
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.800
I admitted to drinking,
but I couldn't,

437
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:32.590
I still didn't have it in me to admit to the drugs.
And,
um,

438
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.800
and then what was the reaction of the public support?
Mostly a lot of them.

439
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:39.740
I mean the politics,
the best part of what politics is,

440
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:42.170
no matter how awesome you think you are,
there's always someone,

441
00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.600
even if you are as awesome as you think you are,
someone out there,

442
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:47.160
he's going to say,
no,
you're not.
And,

443
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.210
and so I had 90% of the public say,
you know,

444
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:54.360
we understand and you've been through a lot and this and that and,

445
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.080
and we support you.
We're here for you and fight on and you're a fighter.

446
00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.940
And it was love.
And I,
and I took it in and,

447
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.590
and it fueled me honestly for a long time through 2018.
I really,

448
00:27:03.591 --> 00:27:07.630
it was trying and,
and uh,
you know,
when I went back and did a few updates,

449
00:27:07.631 --> 00:27:11.970
you stopped drinking?
Yeah,
I could.
Yeah.
I quit drinking new.

450
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:14.580
We quit drinking.
Both of us quit during New Year's Eve.

451
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.620
So the interview is December,
I want to say 18th ish.
2017.

452
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.740
So New Year's Eve,
we stopped drinking.
Um,

453
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.920
and then I spent the rest of the year trying to the rest of 2018.

454
00:27:28.141 --> 00:27:32.990
I have,
especially after the,
I stopped wearing your shirts.
Oh,

455
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.720
good.
Right.
The good with the face.
Those are the shirts I have of yours.

456
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.520
I couldn't like my,
in my mind,
I didn't deserve it.

457
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:45.360
I couldn't even like your books are up on the shelf.
I couldn't even look at it.

458
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.370
My book is up on a shelf.
I couldn't look at it.
I,
um,
2018 I like,

459
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.190
yeah,
I stopped drinking and I admitted to my problem,

460
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:58.191
but then I had to deal with the emotional and psychological effects of realizing

461
00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:02.310
I'm a complete loser.
In my mind.
Right.
Like if,

462
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:05.610
cause as a kid when you grew up,
what was somebody who did drugs a loser?

463
00:28:05.611 --> 00:28:09.330
What was someone that,
so when you drove still doing cocaine at this time?

464
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.250
Oh yeah.
Well I had a break.
I did,
I managed to stop for a bit,

465
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.580
but you know,
my relationship with my,

466
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.740
with my former partner wasn't,
was anything but,
but awesome and you know,

467
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:25.950
and it's not saying bad or good about me or her,
but it's just like,

468
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:27.540
that's what happens in a relationship,
breaks up.

469
00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.770
I'm under massive scrutiny by the public and the media.

470
00:28:31.771 --> 00:28:36.390
Now in Ottawa,
I'm under,
I'm under a lot of,

471
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.590
just a lot of different stressors are coming in,
you know?
Um,

472
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.500
I just,
I just couldn't get anything together,
Dude.

473
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.320
I managed to stop drinking and that was about my only success.

474
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:51.150
So does the coke make you feel like a momentary,
like,
okay,

475
00:28:51.151 --> 00:28:54.150
I've got this,
or does it just cover it up?

476
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.820
It's funny how it makes you think of other things.
Uh,

477
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:01.710
at first you just,
everything is awesome,

478
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.780
but eventually it stops working and it stops,
starts being like,
it's an opposite.

479
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.460
And it's,
it's just like they say it is.

480
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.160
Eventually it starts to try to rewire your brain.

481
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:16.430
I remember coming off oxy cotton and it was harder than getting wounded and

482
00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:19.200
coming off coke isn't harder than getting wounded,

483
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:22.470
but it's easier to get back on.
Does that make sense?

484
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.670
I probably quit three times a week for a while.
They're like,

485
00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:29.730
I'd go two or three days and I'd be like,
Oh,
I'm doing good today.

486
00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:33.810
I didn't go into it.
And then the slightest like push like that,

487
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.340
I don't know if they can see that on the camera.
I'm pushing a water bottle.

488
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.000
I'll see it.
Oh,
there it is.
I'm pushing it.

489
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.260
The slightest push one half a degree off my axis on the compass.

490
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.400
And that was it.
That was it.
April and about.
Oh,
I didn't get,
I didn't get,

491
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:52.150
I didn't drink.
Uh,
but it was like,
well,
I need it.

492
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:57.700
The slightest stressor.
And I would,
and I'd go off and I just,

493
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.990
I stopped having the ability to deal with life's my life's problems,

494
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.140
you know?
And on top of that,
for a lot of that year,
uh,
oh no.

495
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.790
Well 20 after I got back from the road trip where I saw you guys last,

496
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.960
I did put my legs back on.
Um,
but just like,

497
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:16.960
not like just every time I felt like I was like,

498
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.020
I'd go up a couple rungs in the ladder,

499
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.680
I'd fall back a couple and I was making progress,

500
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:27.700
but not the kind of progress someone like me is used to.
Like,

501
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:31.900
I'm used to like being in control.
And if I didn't want to do something,

502
00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:34.150
I don't do it.
And if I want to do something,
I do it.

503
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.800
And this is one of those ones.
And I remember when I admitted to my psychologist,

504
00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.020
truth has,
and I assumed it to sue thousand nine ish.
Uh,
cause I,
like I said,

505
00:30:44.021 --> 00:30:44.710
I picked up,

506
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:49.540
I tried cocaine back in 2003,

507
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:54.220
four,
um,
after my first road would Afghanistan and you know,

508
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.600
and it was like,
okay,
cool,
whatever.
Uh,
it didn't really do it,

509
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.870
think about it for a long time after,
but she said that that one,

510
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.190
that one could get you just be careful.
Uh Oh,

511
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:08.800
she actually said watch out.

512
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.910
This is in 2009 after I'm wounded.
She said,

513
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:16.390
well what do you do to strap to relieve stress?
I'm like,
well you know,

514
00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:19.570
on the weekends I,
my girlfriend and I will drink and do little and,

515
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.510
and she's like,
what?
Coke?
Ooh.
She's like,

516
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:27.430
you have a real casual way of saying sorry man,
it's my life.

517
00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:32.350
But it's seat.
Cause I admitted to her,
cause I try,
no matter what,

518
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:35.440
you need someone you can talk to.
I have,
I've always believed that.

519
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.340
You know what too,
sometimes people develop personalities that they,

520
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:44.260
they managed to figure out how to make things happen.
Right.
So for instance,

521
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.350
some people they just have a way of talking to you.

522
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.360
You ever known someone that can like say something really horrible but they,

523
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.630
but then they say something else,
they kind of like can recover from it.

524
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.620
You don't feel all that bad or you get,

525
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.170
so it sounds like maybe you developed a technique of being like just talking

526
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:04.300
about this in such a way that people go,
oh,
you know,
he's,

527
00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:06.880
if he's talking about this as such a controlled way and it's not that big of a

528
00:32:06.881 --> 00:32:07.451
deal,
you know,

529
00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:10.090
that's probably not that big of a deal cause that's what you're talking about it

530
00:32:10.091 --> 00:32:10.630
to me,

531
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.890
that's how I talked about it to myself because I even had a military doctor and

532
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:16.510
I don't even know if this is a real thing.

533
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:21.050
Tell me I have an Auntie addictive personality,
right?
You,

534
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:22.300
you're getting the most,

535
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.590
and this is what's called re you're getting the biggest reinforcements for your

536
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:29.010
bad behavior.
Oh,
everything you do,
you,

537
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.290
you win and succeed even though you're doing stuff wrong.

538
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.620
Imagine if I had done everything sober,
you know,
like,
um,
but,

539
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.710
but yeah,
anyway she said that and that and that echoed and then you know what I,

540
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.290
I,
I didn't even realize the,
I don't even know what word do you use?

541
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:50.240
Like the fact that I almost lost my career in the 90s because I was with a

542
00:32:50.241 --> 00:32:53.810
friend who bought cocaine and you can read that in the book.

543
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:58.160
And I think we talked about it,
but,
and I didn't,

544
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.890
I'd never done it at that point.
And I didn't want to do it,

545
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:05.390
but I didn't want my friend to go alone into some sleazy Bart barn anyway.

546
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:10.550
And here I am,
all rationalization by the way.
And you're 100% rational.

547
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:14.420
That was in 97.
Here I am in 2017 losing everything to cocaine,

548
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.730
losing everything.
And I thought oxycotton was my problem,
right?

549
00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:24.440
Or the booze.
And it turns out like it just,
I couldn't slay this dragon,
you know.

550
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:29.360
Um,
so,
you know,
2018 was a lot of up and down,
up and down,

551
00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:33.740
up and down.
And,
and yeah,
I gloss over it because it's,

552
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.380
there's too much to talk about on a podcast,

553
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:39.210
but you and I would message back every now and then.

554
00:33:39.211 --> 00:33:42.440
And even the last show you said,
yeah,
well yeah I went through my your texts and,

555
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.640
and uh,
I saw you said the enemy oh flank to me and this and that.
29,

556
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.700
18 was me figuring out how to regroup and reorganize and,

557
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.110
and I'm still,
and I realized too dude,
like uh,

558
00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:01.210
anyone who's been wounded in action or hurt in life recovery is it takes a team.

559
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.660
It's taken me 12 years and I'm not even recovered from getting blown up yet.

560
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.940
You know,
right before the show we were talking about,

561
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.190
and I think we probably talked about the first time I was here,

562
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:12.200
cause I recognize this a long time ago.

563
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.910
I always prepared to die or get that awesome wound I can brag about at the

564
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:20.930
barbecue when I'm old,
we send a lot of bandages in body bags,

565
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:24.530
Afghanistan as a,
as a force.
And I think you,
you guys did too.

566
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:28.730
At first we didn't even think about all the career ending injuries that are

567
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.030
possible.
You know,
cause we aren't draftees,

568
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:35.780
they went aren't the greatest generation work professional soldiers.

569
00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:40.610
I saw myself retiring at a,
I don't know what the age is here,

570
00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:44.570
but probably 55 grizzled old sergeant or warn officer,

571
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.270
you know,
go and then teach,
teach shooting at the,

572
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.930
the Canadian army sniper school,
you know,
as a,

573
00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:53.660
as a contractor or something or I dunno,

574
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:58.240
I just never saw myself not being a soldier.
And,

575
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.870
and you know what I realized this the other day,
the politics was a bandaid.

576
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:08.030
The TV shows,
the books,
the podcasts,
these are all a part of me finding a way,

577
00:35:08.031 --> 00:35:11.100
but I'm back.
You know,
I'm,
I'm instructing,
shooting again,
you know,

578
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.770
with some of my friends.
I'm back to,
uh,
advocating for veterans again,
you know,

579
00:35:15.771 --> 00:35:18.770
which I can have time for him.
I'm trying to work.
I quit.

580
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.750
I could have run again for politics and one easily,
even with all my troubles.
Um,

581
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:29.450
I see.
I didn't want to,
I want to be like,
Jocko,
I want to work for myself.

582
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.200
No,
dude,
listen.
Well,
I don't work for myself.
When you were,

583
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:36.590
I think even the first or definitely the second time you came down and you're

584
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:39.570
telling me about all this,
all this stuff that you have to put up with every day,

585
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:42.660
all these people that you're dealing with,
and I just said,
bro,

586
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.440
why don't you just not do that job again?

587
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.120
Because the job satisfaction that you're getting out of it is none.

588
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.560
I mean,
maybe you're getting a little bit,

589
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:55.200
but basically you're not getting any real job satisfaction.

590
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.110
You're having to say things that you don't really feel like saying you're having

591
00:35:58.111 --> 00:35:59.940
to talk to people that you really don't feel like talking to.

592
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.330
And meanwhile you're dealing with the fact that you lost your legs in

593
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:08.331
Afghanistan every freaking day as a is a is as presents challenges anyways,

594
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.060
and then you're presenting yourself with challenges that you don't enjoy it

595
00:36:12.061 --> 00:36:13.260
because it's one thing to say,
oh,

596
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.890
I'm going to go do Jujitsu today and it's a challenge,

597
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:19.290
but it's a challenge I enjoy,
or,
oh,
I'm going to go for a run today,

598
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:21.150
but it's a challenge.
I enjoy it.
It's another thing to say,

599
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.960
I'm going to go do this challenge that I do not like and I don't get anything

600
00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:26.630
out of that.
To me was,

601
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.700
was worrying to me it was the first time we met and we were at echoes brothers

602
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:37.080
company where podcast was.
And you,
your advice rang.
You know,

603
00:36:37.081 --> 00:36:40.410
Kelly and I had a long talk before I announced I wouldn't run again.

604
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.210
And she said the same thing.
She says,

605
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:46.500
remember what Jockos said the squeeze isn't worth the juice or like that's the

606
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:49.080
way she put it.
But that's,
she was,
when I got home,

607
00:36:49.081 --> 00:36:52.780
I told her what we talked about and Kelly and I were just friends back then and

608
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.750
a and stuff.
But um,
you know,
it,
that was a big,

609
00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:02.310
my sister,
my baby sister actually she see said,
uh,
you know,

610
00:37:02.311 --> 00:37:06.120
I knew you wouldn't last in politics,
not,
and she,
and it wasn't an insult.

611
00:37:06.121 --> 00:37:08.790
You said you're just,
you're not,
you're not the right person.

612
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.220
Like your personality isn't,
isn't for the political side of things.
And,

613
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.180
and I want to work for myself and I love,
my podcast is backup.

614
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.430
We've done a couple of episodes,
you know,
we're still figuring it out.

615
00:37:20.431 --> 00:37:24.630
Kelly and I want to do online coaching now for people.
Like we've got some hard,

616
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:25.860
hard miles between us,

617
00:37:25.861 --> 00:37:29.580
so we want to try and help people avoid some of the things we've gone through.

618
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.600
And,
um,
and we're started and I'm just starting to like wander.
I'm becoming like,

619
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:38.130
uh,
the guy in,
uh,
we're,
we're big.
We,
I should say,
because we're a team.

620
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.610
Um,
we're like the guy in Kung Fu,
we just wander.

621
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.430
We're just gonna wander onto the earth,
wander the earth,
and,

622
00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:48.420
and make our own schedule.
And,
uh,
but we,
you know what,

623
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.110
we do more work in a day now.
Like it,
it doesn't seem like work,

624
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:56.430
but we get more accomplished in a day or two now than we used to in two weeks

625
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.540
because it's for ourselves and it's just,
and it's fun now,

626
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.080
but I mean when we're just starting.
But I mean,
you know,
back to the story,

627
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.210
I just,
um,
I lost myself and I finally have come,

628
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:13.860
I think close to full circle back to who I was except,
you know,

629
00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:18.840
I'm 42 and I accept that I lost my legs and I accept that my career ended and I

630
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:23.841
accept that I'm a complete mess up if I let myself be and I accept that I'm a

631
00:38:24.361 --> 00:38:25.500
human being because of it.

632
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.120
Cause I don't know anyone who doesn't have any flaws.
But you're,

633
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.830
you're extreme ownership.
And the way I,
I've always,

634
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.380
even before I had a term,
extreme ownership,

635
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.570
ask anyone who knows me,

636
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:44.410
I might not tell you that all of the things about me or about my life,

637
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.060
but I'm not going to bullshit you.

638
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:50.350
And I'm not gonna lie about things that don't matter.

639
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.440
And I know everything matters.
If something can matter.

640
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.690
If you're not lying about something because it doesn't matter,

641
00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:00.430
but there's some things that are none of your business.
But I even,
you know,

642
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:04.930
anyone who knows me knows that I don't bullshit for the most part.
You know,

643
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.740
cause you know,
sometimes I'll mess with it with you just for fun,
but,

644
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.350
and that's just the way I want to live my life.
And,
and,

645
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.540
and I was bullshitting myself.
Ew,
you,
her,

646
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.520
my kids,
the public,

647
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.450
all the people that supported me supported me for half truth.

648
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:26.830
This is why I told you your listeners deserve to have Jody Mitic come back and

649
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.980
say,
hey guys,
cause a lot of your listeners bro,
like,
dude,
I,

650
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.000
you know,
I don't want to tear up or anything because I'm a man or you know,

651
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:35.501
whatever.

652
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:40.420
But I get a message minimum one a week since the last show,

653
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:45.320
minimum,
often it's for five,
10.
Uh,
hey man,

654
00:39:45.321 --> 00:39:50.080
I heard you on Jocko.
Thanks for being so truthful about your problems.

655
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.940
And it helped me quit drinking here.

656
00:39:51.941 --> 00:39:55.180
It helped me get back into Jim and it and I'm like,
fuck,

657
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:59.770
I had to come back and just say,
hey guys,
like I,

658
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:03.520
you're,
you're back in the gym.
I ain't even been to the gym since October,
2016,

659
00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.900
you know,
I know you can't believe it,
but,
uh,
uh,
good genetics,

660
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.380
good genetics.
But I mean,
I'm just saying like,

661
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.960
I felt like a fraud dude and I hated it.
And like she would watch me,
like just,

662
00:40:16.961 --> 00:40:19.120
I would get a message and I'd be like,
you know,

663
00:40:19.121 --> 00:40:20.810
I'd like throw the phone and she'd be like,

664
00:40:20.811 --> 00:40:23.890
you should get another message from someone who heard you on Jocko.
And I'm like,

665
00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:27.940
Yup.
And I,
my podcast is nowhere to be found in the book.

666
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.620
I could've made twice as much money on that book if I had been put together

667
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:35.800
enough up here to tour with it more to go over them.

668
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.190
And I still could have done my job,
but I,

669
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:41.260
I was compromising myself so much on,
on the,

670
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:45.550
on the front end that on the backend I couldn't keep it up,
you know.
So I had to,

671
00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:49.450
it was like do,
do politics well or do the book well,
can't do both.

672
00:40:49.451 --> 00:40:53.680
Well I stopped being able to multitask and everything and I just wanted to come

673
00:40:53.681 --> 00:40:57.820
on the show and say sorry to you guys and all the listeners and just say,

674
00:40:57.821 --> 00:40:59.230
and I know a lot of them will say,

675
00:40:59.231 --> 00:41:03.070
you don't always say I owe you add for me please.
You know I owe you guys,

676
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.610
you guys supported me,
but you deserve the truth.

677
00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:11.611
And the truth is I was doing a lot more than drinking and I did 30 days in Rehab

678
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:16.240
at the end of the law.
When did I go in?
Right after Christmas.

679
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:21.190
And I am back on a path of righteousness,
if you want to call it that.

680
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:24.190
I am trying to atone.
Uh,

681
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:26.440
I'm trying to rebuild some bridges.

682
00:41:26.441 --> 00:41:30.430
I burned and I've had people not returned my call and I don't blame them.

683
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
I was a bit,
I was,
I was that guy you see in the movies for good,

684
00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:38.870
solid three,
three months there.
At the end of the year,
I went full,

685
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:44.120
I don't want to say that word,
but I went,
I just,
I went full,
full dummy.

686
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.200
Uh,
and I,
and I realize that and you know,
so that's why I'm here.

687
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.430
Was there a point,
what led you to say

688
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.480
that you are going to go to Rehab?

689
00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.140
I mean for the Cliche is,
you know,
what was rock bottom?

690
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:02.270
At what point did you look at yourself and say,
damn,

691
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:07.310
I gotta get my shit together now.
My girls needed me.

692
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.150
Kelly needed me,
my mom needed me,
my dad,
my,
if,

693
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.450
if everyone in your life is telling you there's a problem,

694
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:16.543
there's a problem.

695
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:21.840
And they managed to get through the static,
uh,

696
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:22.760
that was in my head.

697
00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:27.761
And Kelly has had some serious health issues that weren't being helped by my

698
00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:35.450
behavior to say the least.
Um,
she suffered,
uh,

699
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:40.130
do you mind if I told them?
So she had a hysterectomy right in 25,

700
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:42.590
2017,
which is all part of the story.

701
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.150
And she almost died on the operating or she then got sepsis and then almost died

702
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.950
at the time.
Our relationship wasn't an open thing.
Um,

703
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.780
and I couldn't be there for her.

704
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:56.720
And then my legs stopped working and we couldn't be there for each other,

705
00:42:56.721 --> 00:42:59.390
even in private.
And uh,

706
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:03.080
and then so that was 2017.
So she's trying to,

707
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:07.440
um,
look after me and,
and herself and her and her,

708
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:10.790
her own relationship changing.
But anyway,
um,

709
00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.680
so she had,

710
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.150
she had a cardiac moment from the stress of watching me destroying myself.

711
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:21.920
So Kelly had a cardiac moment,
my daughters were crying,
you know,

712
00:43:21.921 --> 00:43:23.690
where's Daddy,
where you're always,

713
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:28.010
and then you're always late to get us or,
and then when we're with you,

714
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:31.850
you sleep.
And uh,
and my mom,

715
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.690
for my mom and my dad to agree on something,

716
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.170
which is Jody needs help was another light bulb.

717
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:44.710
And I was still in here somewhere like Jodie was still there and trying his best

718
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.740
and being so self reflective.

719
00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:51.410
And if you ever have to go in through anything like this,
again,

720
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:53.600
this is something you can't,

721
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.620
no one can describe and everybody's is different and you're looking for the rock

722
00:43:57.621 --> 00:44:02.060
bottom.
I had a couple and every one of them was in my,

723
00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:03.380
and from my point of view,

724
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.660
my relationship with the people I love was on thin ice.

725
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.270
You know,
if my best friend,
my soulmate and my future wife,

726
00:44:14.271 --> 00:44:17.510
the person I want to marry is saying,
I,

727
00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:22.540
my health cannot sustain this so I will have to leave you because for,

728
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.350
for my own health,
nevermind you,
you're my health.

729
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.790
That's when I was like,
okay,
well obviously obviously I got it.

730
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:33.833
This isn't working.

731
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.040
What does it look like day to day when you're doing so much cocaine that it's

732
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:39.120
causing all these issues?

733
00:44:39.121 --> 00:44:44.070
Cause I actually don't know and I probably never will know.
Hopefully.

734
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.890
And if you do,
I'll fly down here and we'll figure it out.

735
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:49.010
But that's the thing is,
uh,

736
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.890
you honestly believe everyone's against you.
Um,

737
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.730
you honestly believe there is no right move.

738
00:44:56.731 --> 00:45:00.600
You can make except calling that guy who has the stuff.

739
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:02.010
And then,

740
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:07.010
and even though I got to a point where I knew exactly where doing the coke would

741
00:45:07.981 --> 00:45:12.720
lead and I didn't care,
I didn't care.
I'd waste another day,

742
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:16.950
uh,
or another,
it usually it was three days and we're,
we're completely wasted.

743
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.930
Cause what,
what does that look like?
When you waste three days?
You,

744
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.370
you buy a bunch of cocaine,
you do a bunch and then you know,

745
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:26.730
you can only do so much right before he just feel like crap.
You just,

746
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:31.050
you physically just can't do more than you can or you could and you know,

747
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:35.550
and because of who I am and the way my mind works,
I'm always aware of,
okay,

748
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:37.500
there's oding as possible.
Uh,

749
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:39.810
there's just your body can physically give out if you like.

750
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.840
Your body needs sleep.
Right.
Were three trained for that.

751
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.920
Like we were trained like,
and so I didn't have all this information.
And also,

752
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:50.820
you know,
I knew a guy who is Canadian Special Operations Regiment.

753
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.980
I didn't really know him that well,
but in his mind,
he and he would break.

754
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.630
You would say,
I know what I'm going to,

755
00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:01.260
if I'm going to die in a room for the cocaine and hookers.
And he did.

756
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.500
He did it to him,
but he wanted to,
I didn't want to die.

757
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:09.360
I have no interest in dying.
Um,
so,
you know,

758
00:46:09.361 --> 00:46:12.090
I have all these factors and then it's weird.

759
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:17.190
But at the near the end I was,
oh,
sorry.
And here's another rock bottom moment.

760
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.420
I started buying booze again because booze and coke,

761
00:46:21.421 --> 00:46:24.760
like one brings you up and then the other one brings you down.
And they Kinda,

762
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:29.280
that's why they go together so well.
And if that's what you're looking for it,

763
00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:33.900
but don't kids.
Okay.
Um,
so when you do a bunch of coke,

764
00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:37.380
what are you,
when you say you waste three days,
what are you doing?
Nothing.

765
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:41.510
It's not like hyper productive.
Hey,
I'm going to go.
Right.
And you are not,

766
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:46.380
when you're in the state of mind.
I was at first.
Yeah,
a little bit.
What?

767
00:46:46.381 --> 00:46:48.270
Take you through the weekend and you'd get,

768
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.230
you'd get your email inbox will be empty.
Uh,
it might not make,

769
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:56.170
some of your replies might not make a lot of sense,
but you get through them.
Um,

770
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:57.270
you might read that book,

771
00:46:57.271 --> 00:47:01.410
you've been wanting to do it and you might binge watch like friends or
something.

772
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.071
You know,

773
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:06.840
I've binge watched a lot of mindless TV on coke,

774
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:11.510
like friends.
How I met your mother.
Uh,
the show house,
uh,

775
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:16.290
scrubs,
things that didn't matter because I couldn't watch,
I love documentaries,

776
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:18.480
but I couldn't watch them because they made me too sad.

777
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.620
And then I couldn't watch ones that were about people like success stories

778
00:47:22.621 --> 00:47:23.970
because then I'd feel like a failure.

779
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.960
So I watched all of this meaningless TV and that's what I would do.

780
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.960
She'd come by and I'd watching like episode 300 of how I met your mother.

781
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:36.730
I have a piece of,
have a pizza box there with one slice,
with one bite out of it.

782
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:41.230
And maybe I was drinking like a protein shake or something,
you know,

783
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:45.190
cause I had to hide.
You gotta hydrate Bro.
You gotta hydrate and so,
and get,

784
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:50.080
she'd show up with a six pack of Gatorade and a Alpha brain or like another

785
00:47:50.081 --> 00:47:53.110
generic a nootropic cause I was the thing,
I was like,
oh,

786
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:57.310
as long as I got my new tropics.
Yeah.
But,
um,
and so that's three days.

787
00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:01.630
And because I wasn't wearing my legs,
I literally sat on the couch,
like,

788
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:02.980
look at my posture right now.

789
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.620
This is from sitting on the couch for like a year straight.

790
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:11.050
Like I gotta like work now,
you know,
and I,
uh,
and yeah,
man,
you just,

791
00:48:11.051 --> 00:48:14.800
some of your behavior is inexplainable and I'll tell you right now,

792
00:48:14.801 --> 00:48:19.600
I did some be some behavior that I'm just like,
you know,
I don't know.

793
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.620
It's a,
it's a literal fall.
And then I wasn't evil or anything,

794
00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:28.360
but I was not a good guy.
I was not a good guy.
I'm lucky to have her next to me.

795
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:30.130
I'm lucky to have that.
My kids still talk to me.

796
00:48:30.131 --> 00:48:33.820
I'm lucky my mom didn't disown me,
you know?
Um,

797
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:38.560
I know at the end of the day they all came together and I,
I sucked it up.

798
00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:42.730
I manned up,
I took ownership and I went to rehab and I threw my,

799
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:44.240
I did what I did in my book,
you know,

800
00:48:44.241 --> 00:48:47.620
left that line where I say I went back to training.

801
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:49.720
Like I got sent him as punishment.

802
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:53.290
I got sent back to the battle school and I had a choice.

803
00:48:53.291 --> 00:48:57.910
I could be the asshole that I was the first time or I could show up in shape

804
00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.940
with my boots polished and my uniform Ireland and be the best candidate and a

805
00:49:03.541 --> 00:49:07.060
soldier that I could be.
And I did that and I,

806
00:49:07.061 --> 00:49:08.680
he went to Rehab and I did that.

807
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.580
And within 30 days they were offering me a job.

808
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.870
<v 0>I got one more question about that,
but the bottom,
so you,</v>

809
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.660
you basically,
this happens for three,
for three days,

810
00:49:21.661 --> 00:49:25.410
you buy enough cocaine for three days and then you're watching TV,

811
00:49:25.411 --> 00:49:29.460
you're eating pizza,
you're sitting around,
you're just in a bad place.

812
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.590
Then you run out of cocaine.

813
00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:36.390
And then when you are not high anymore from the cocaine,

814
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.510
are you like,
okay,
I just want to get more cocaine.

815
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.550
Is that basically what happens?

816
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:45.380
<v 2>Um,
usually you go through a period of self loathing.</v>

817
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.570
<v 0>Okay.
I was going to say,
help me point when you,
when you,</v>

818
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.340
when you sober up and you go,
Dang,
why,
why am I doing this?

819
00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.660
<v 2>Like a lot.</v>

820
00:49:54.661 --> 00:49:59.661
But also it's a joke in the community are those that enjoy that partake because

821
00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.220
it's called the cocaine blues because your system has been hijacked and

822
00:50:05.221 --> 00:50:09.840
hardwired and been,
it's Kinda like when you nitrous your engine,
right?

823
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:14.820
And you just nitrous it until it red lines.
Uh,
eventually there's nothing left.

824
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:18.650
So that's what happens as soon as you like let the nitrous out the,

825
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.040
the engine kind of like it goes,

826
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:23.610
it has no power for a while and until it cools off.

827
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.290
And that's basically what you go through.

828
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:30.470
And the only way to remedy if less you power through the three to three to three

829
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:31.370
days or the week,

830
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:36.371
depending on how long your binge was till your serotonin levels come back and it

831
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:40.850
takes,
it can take,
and I,
at this point I was abusing for a year,
right?

832
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.880
Like steady.
Well,
actually by the end of last year,

833
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:46.820
it was two years steady state,
2017,

834
00:50:46.821 --> 00:50:51.350
2018 are basically a write off for me.
As much as I got certain things done,

835
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:55.280
a lot of it was a write off,
but you,
you go through,

836
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:59.600
as soon as it's done,
you're like,
I'm never doing this again.
Oh my God,
I can't,

837
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:02.060
you call,
I'd call her and I'd be like,
I'm sorry.
I can't believe I did it.

838
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:05.480
She'd be like,
all right,
well I've heard that before.
You know,

839
00:51:05.481 --> 00:51:09.200
at first it was optimism.
Okay,
good.
Yeah,
we'll work on this together.
And then,

840
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.800
but then you know what?
And then like I said,
you know,

841
00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.530
remember when I said an inch off your as as a myth or whatever.

842
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.680
Now it's like a millimeter and you're like,
all right.

843
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:23.350
And unfortunately the guy delivers,
you know,
so you don't even have to get,

844
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.450
you don't even have to get dressed.
He just come to the door and like,
you know,

845
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.290
and then put it on my tab and uh,
you know,
and yeah,

846
00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:32.090
and even when and when that guy says,

847
00:51:32.091 --> 00:51:35.480
are you sure that's another indication?
Like,

848
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:40.220
wouldn't the guy who makes money off you being an idiot thinks you're an idiot?

849
00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:44.750
You got to start thinking about life choices.
And you know,

850
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.150
I did it.
I went through it,
man.
[inaudible] again,
I'm here to tell the truth.

851
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:53.750
You and the listeners,
because they're watchers,
if they're on youtube,

852
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:57.740
like I can't hide it and to,
to,

853
00:51:57.741 --> 00:52:01.830
to pretend I just had some issues like a lot of people,
uh,

854
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.640
you hear in the media,
right?
Oh,
there they're having some issues.

855
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:09.060
Just say what it is,
man.
It's just what,
as soon as I went on the,
uh,

856
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:14.110
show in Ottawa,
the same guy who,
who came to me and I,
and I did the,
and I,

857
00:52:14.111 --> 00:52:16.760
and I went on a show and I said it,
I said I did cocaine.

858
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.650
It felt like a thousand pounds man off my shoulders.
And he's,
he's like,

859
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:24.560
I did not expect that.
I said,
I know,
man.

860
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.950
And that's how much of a bullshit artist I became an eye.
And I hate it.

861
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.460
I hate it.
My ex even said once,
she said you weren't,

862
00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:36.110
you weren't a sneaky bullshitter before,
you know,
like you gotta stop this.

863
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:41.420
And you know,
it's the extreme ownership comes in here because

864
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.290
even when I,
you know,

865
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:48.950
when I first back 20 years ago when I first got sent back to training as

866
00:52:48.951 --> 00:52:52.470
punishment for being an idiot,
I owned it.
Anyone say,
Hey,

867
00:52:52.471 --> 00:52:55.280
are you the guy who got arrested for coke?
I'd be like,
well I didn't have it but,

868
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:59.240
but yeah,
yeah that was me.
Because what are you gonna do?
Say No.

869
00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.460
Like,
you know,
and,

870
00:53:01.461 --> 00:53:05.780
and I always tried to live that way and I lost myself to this stuff and I,

871
00:53:05.781 --> 00:53:08.720
this has stopped being honest with everyone,
especially myself.

872
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.560
And that's saying that you got to look after yourself before you can look after

873
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:17.030
anybody else's is a 150% true.
You know,
even,

874
00:53:17.031 --> 00:53:20.210
and Kelly's even learned some lessons here cause she didn't take enough time to

875
00:53:20.211 --> 00:53:24.500
recover from her surgery and it almost killed her again.
You know,
and she,

876
00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:27.150
because she was worried about that at work and her kids and this,

877
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:31.350
you got to worry about yourself.
And um,
and again,
man,

878
00:53:31.351 --> 00:53:36.120
I'm on like a redemption to her almost.
I feel like I,
and I love it.
I love it.

879
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:40.710
Like we were,
we,
where were we?
I forgot where we were,

880
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:42.410
but you know,
somebody said something and I went,
Oh yeah,

881
00:53:42.411 --> 00:53:46.830
I just got out of Rehab for cocaine.
And they went,
oh,
okay.
Uh,

882
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:49.290
so coffee,
cause I think they wanted to get a drink and I'm like,
yeah,

883
00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:51.060
I just got to rehab,
you know,

884
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.210
it's a great conversation starter or ender.
So talk to me about Rehab.

885
00:53:57.211 --> 00:54:00.270
What,
what goes on there?
You know,
it's a,

886
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:05.190
it's a whole lot of just being told to think about how you're living your life.

887
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:09.960
Um,
I did mow usually for cocaine,
they want 90 days.

888
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:13.530
I was only willing to commit to 30 because I still had a little bit of like that

889
00:54:13.531 --> 00:54:16.620
ego going and stuff.
Um,

890
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:22.320
and I did the 30 and I did okay.
And,
uh,
like I said,

891
00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:24.470
they were offering me a job or like,
you know,

892
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.190
we were in talks about maybe working there.
Um,
but you know,

893
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:37.340
it's funny how like once you open your mind to possibilities,

894
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.470
this the way forward is,
is obvious.

895
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:46.250
I have no business being in this town called Brockville where the rehab place

896
00:54:46.381 --> 00:54:50.190
was.
Um,
but if I wasn't there,

897
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.480
Kelly and I wouldn't have found this building that when I was sending you where,

898
00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:59.120
which inspired us to remind us that two years ago when we first moved out of our

899
00:54:59.121 --> 00:55:02.940
house or three years ago now,
holy crap,
almost three years ago now,

900
00:55:02.941 --> 00:55:07.260
when we first moved out from our old relationships and we're trying to establish

901
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:08.790
her own,
um,

902
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:14.610
my goal before I got elected was I wanted to open a gym and I wanted to build a

903
00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:18.600
community of positive people and I wanted to like wake up every morning,

904
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.030
have a coffee.
Like,
I don't know why,

905
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:24.960
but in my mind I have an image of me in shorts with a long sleeve tee shirt

906
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:29.730
opening up like a garage door and having like people come in with gym bags like,

907
00:55:29.731 --> 00:55:31.440
Hey Jody,
how's it going?
Good morning sir.

908
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.740
You don't like and not stare like hey sir,
but like,
cause I'm like,

909
00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:39.420
I'm like the leader or like I'm the,
I'm the papa bear of this group.

910
00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:40.081
That's what we,

911
00:55:40.081 --> 00:55:43.530
Kelly and I call it has those Mama and papa bear and will even in Rehab they

912
00:55:43.531 --> 00:55:45.060
started calling me papa bear.
Cause I'd be like,

913
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.750
I was almost twice as old as most of the people there.
Um,

914
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.340
most of them were like late teens,
early twenties,
maybe 30.
Some of them were 30.

915
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.580
But you know,
even the older people like there was like one woman,

916
00:55:56.581 --> 00:55:58.530
they're in their sixties and she'd be like,
Hey papa bear,

917
00:55:58.531 --> 00:56:01.890
because that's just who we are.
Like I like,
you're the same,
you're like me,

918
00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:06.600
but like and Kelly's this,
we just,
we want to look after people.
We can't help it.

919
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:10.590
Right.
You know,
and the Rehab people will look after yourself.
But anyway,

920
00:56:10.591 --> 00:56:13.890
Kelly comes and picks me up and I'm alive.
I can give an a day pass,

921
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.290
you know that go,
they let you go vote for the day.
If you're good,

922
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:18.810
if you're good boy echo,
they let you go out on Rehab.

923
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.810
And so we're driving around.
That's when I saw that building.

924
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.800
I think I sent you picked your duty the next,
yeah,

925
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.330
1905 this thing was a windmill,
a beautiful big wooden beams,

926
00:56:28.331 --> 00:56:29.560
like a beautiful building.

927
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.090
Unfortunately it would have been more to repair it than it would have been to

928
00:56:34.091 --> 00:56:38.920
buy it,
but it put our minds on this path to what a great area that is.

929
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:43.030
The fact that we want to go back on this path of building this community.

930
00:56:43.031 --> 00:56:47.930
And so we want to build.
So we're still doing it every and,
and,

931
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:48.843
and we,
you should,

932
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:52.360
you should hit Kelly and I drive a lot because we have our best meetings are

933
00:56:52.361 --> 00:56:55.060
business meetings or when we're driving and,

934
00:56:55.570 --> 00:57:00.550
and so we want to open what's called Hq and it's going to be a fitness wellness

935
00:57:00.551 --> 00:57:05.080
center.
And,
um,
and it's going to be more of a community than anything.

936
00:57:05.081 --> 00:57:07.750
Kind of like if you want to just come chill,
you can come chill.

937
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:10.900
We're going to have,
I want to have a library,
I want to have a podcast studio,

938
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:13.320
I want to have classrooms and you know,

939
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.380
and we're going to just like be there to help you live a better life.

940
00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.120
And,
uh,

941
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:22.450
and the best way for me to live a good life is to help you live a good life.

942
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:27.150
And I've realized that now,
like even when I was in my military unit,
like,
um,

943
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:30.550
even if I wasn't hungry,
I'd grab extra food and bring it back to the boys.

944
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:34.670
You know,
if I,
if I realize like there was something shiny around to be had,

945
00:57:34.671 --> 00:57:38.380
I'd like find a way to get my hands on it for the,
for the team and stuff.

946
00:57:38.381 --> 00:57:43.150
You know,
I'm my happiest when I'm looking out for others and I know,

947
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.890
and at the same time though,
you know,

948
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:49.200
they're looking out for you and it feels good to have friends and family and,

949
00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:52.000
and you know,
a tribe around you.
Right.
You know,

950
00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:56.560
we're tribal animals and I,
you know,
do you know Tait Fletcher?

951
00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.480
He was Joe Rogan Buddy.
Yeah,
for sure.
Um,
well,
I don't know him personally.

952
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:06.420
So I met,
I met Tate in 2013 when I did a piece for vice,
uh,

953
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:11.080
at the University of Southern California about how they do virtual reality to

954
00:58:11.081 --> 00:58:14.930
treat PTSD.
It's on motherboard,
if you want to Google it and go ahead.
I mean,

955
00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:18.010
I look pretty cool in it,
but anyway,
um,
so Tate,

956
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:20.230
I was down here and I had met Tate when I was here.

957
00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:22.310
I did his podcast and in this,
and you know,

958
00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:27.220
so this is going back six or seven years.
And,
um,
I've never met Rogan,

959
00:58:27.221 --> 00:58:29.950
but I mean eventually I might,
I mean I know enough people that know him.

960
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:33.940
But anyway,
the point is I was driving around with Tate and uh,

961
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:38.850
we're here in California to do a course at Deuce gym in La,
uh,

962
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:40.690
which Tate introduced me to the owner of,

963
00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:44.290
and this guy has just such a cool dude and he rents such a nice gym and the

964
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:48.430
atmosphere.
So we're going to take his seminar.
And I,
and I said,
man,

965
00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:51.760
I wish I had what you have here in California,
any and Tate,

966
00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:56.290
this was a mine chain or a life changing moment and I had to go through all of

967
00:58:56.291 --> 00:59:01.000
this to get here.
He said,
build it.
And I said,
ah,
what?

968
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:05.170
He said,
if you want it,
build it.
And I said,
okay.

969
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:09.160
And it's taken me since 2013 to get back to here and go through all these other

970
00:59:09.161 --> 00:59:12.220
things to realize like,
ah,
I got to build it.

971
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:16.150
That's why knock going into politics again means I can do whatever I want.

972
00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.310
Like you said,
man,
like you're right.
Like it's tough.
Like it's,

973
00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.680
there's moments of great happiness and politics,

974
00:59:21.681 --> 00:59:25.250
but unless that's what you want to do,
like it's hard.

975
00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.020
It's very hard and guys like us,

976
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:32.000
we're self motivated to do things and waiting around for others to do their

977
00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:36.350
thing and it's just easier to do your own thing,
you know?
Uh,

978
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.850
especially,
you know,
like what's,
I know he was a German,
but in world war two,
his,

979
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:43.400
his orders were finding an objective and kill it.

980
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.420
That was his orders at all times.
Like if you don't hear from me,

981
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:49.160
find something and destroy it.

982
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.330
That's basically the mission statement that Kelly and I have put before.

983
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:56.150
So I was like,
we want to build this place,

984
00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:00.380
build a community and live a good life.
And I never want to be,

985
01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:04.070
the guy was for the last two years.
And uh,

986
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:09.110
but I want to say glad,
but it's an experience that I've learned a lot from.

987
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.740
Does that make sense?
Yeah,
it does make sense.
It does make sense.

988
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.370
It's sort of like the thing I told the Sam Harris when he,

989
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.400
when he was telling me that it's hypocritical for me because I say war is

990
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:26.120
horrible and awful,
but I always say it's the best experience of my life.

991
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:30.890
And he says,
hypocritical for that.
And then,
well,
rightfully so,

992
01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:33.920
you can't say something's awesome and then say it's horrible.
And I said,
well,

993
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:34.880
it's like this.

994
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:40.010
And I asked him if he had ever known anyone that had had cancer and survived and

995
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:40.940
he said yes.
And I said,

996
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.500
a lot of those people say I'm glad it happened because they get this different

997
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:48.830
perspective of life and different perspective of the world and different value

998
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:50.570
of life and different value of the world.

999
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:53.210
And so even though you wouldn't wish it on somebody,

1000
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.880
you're happy that you had to go through it.
And so I,

1001
01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.500
that sounds like a similar situation.

1002
01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:03.410
I always tell people I had a great time at war right up to the last step because

1003
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:08.240
it's a horrible thing to do.
But it's what I trained.
I volunteered to be there.

1004
01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:11.820
You volunteered to be there.
Like,
I always say,
you know,
people could be,

1005
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.870
a lot of people say they're sorry for me losing my feet.
And I say,
you know,

1006
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.970
if I was a Russian drafty and Afghanistan,
yeah.
Be or feel sorry for me,
but I've,

1007
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.880
I was exactly where I want it to be,
you know?
And uh,

1008
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:27.020
and the fact that one of my boys didn't die because I stepped on that,
you know,

1009
01:01:27.021 --> 01:01:29.840
like the,
if the,
like I said,
if the guy in front of me had stepped on it,

1010
01:01:29.841 --> 01:01:30.674
I'd be dead.

1011
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:33.650
If the guy in front of him had stepped down and he'd be dead and I'd be like,

1012
01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:38.120
we don't know.
Um,
I'm glad I was the one that stepped on it.
But yeah.

1013
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:42.500
Like I love doing my job.
It was a great,
it was an,
it was an amazing job,

1014
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:42.861
you know,

1015
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:46.610
been the people that you're around or some of the greatest human beings you're

1016
01:01:46.611 --> 01:01:50.960
ever going to know on the planet,
you know?
Um,
so that's what I want to rebuild.

1017
01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:55.310
I want to rebuild this brotherhood and the sisterhood,
this community of,
of,

1018
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.800
of likeminded individuals and the saying,

1019
01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.410
surround yourself with people that make you better.

1020
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:04.160
That's not what happens when you're on cocaine.
So,

1021
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:08.660
so at some point you went from this mindset of you could see where the future

1022
01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:12.320
was,
you could see the cocaine is going to ruin your future and you didn't care.

1023
01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:15.320
And at some point during this,
you said to yourself,
okay,

1024
01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:20.220
I see the future with cocaine.
It's terrible and I'm not going to go there.
Yeah,

1025
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.370
well it was,
it was life without Kelly.
It was life without the kids.

1026
01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:27.090
It was life without real friends.
Uh,
you know,

1027
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:31.950
like even people that love you to death can't be around you because you know,

1028
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:36.450
you're just not assist.
It's one,
it's hard,
you know,
and I've,

1029
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:40.200
I've had a few buddies go down and it mostly booze,

1030
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.830
like boozes that most common one because it's rarely available there.

1031
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.940
Go down to the store and get it for some reason.
Um,
you know,
like,
listen,

1032
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:50.580
I get a lot of flack but I'm a fan of the,

1033
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.730
and I know safe injection site is like,
people don't agree with,

1034
01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:56.070
there's no such thing as safe injection.
Okay,
I get it.

1035
01:02:56.370 --> 01:03:00.780
But the point is I'm forgiving the option of a place that's safer than a

1036
01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:05.070
dumpster to shoot up with heroin if it means we might save that life.
Right.

1037
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:09.600
And I'm also like,
we've visited Canada federally,
we legalize marijuana.

1038
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.730
Um,
if it was up to me,
anything people want would be regulated,

1039
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:19.710
taxed and taxed,
right?
Because,
um,
if a bottle of Jack Daniels,
Hertz,

1040
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.800
Hertz Echo,
if he drinks it or hurt,
like if it hurts us,

1041
01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:26.400
there's someone who can be held accountable and we can trace that right down to

1042
01:03:26.401 --> 01:03:30.780
the barrel that it was brewed in or made,
I dunno how whiskey is fermented,

1043
01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.760
distill,
distill,
there's the word.

1044
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.080
Whereas if a guy shoots up behind a dumpster and dies,

1045
01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:38.900
I don't know who to go after and who to like,

1046
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:41.850
whose fault is it that it was a bad product or a good product,

1047
01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:45.930
which is usually what gives them an overdose.
But you know,
like there's just,

1048
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:50.430
um,
the past too,
you know,

1049
01:03:50.431 --> 01:03:54.480
like Aa is there because we can get booze at every corner,
you know,

1050
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:58.860
and so we have gambling sites.
If you go into a casino,

1051
01:03:58.861 --> 01:04:00.480
you're actually warned on the door,

1052
01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:02.670
like a pack of cigarettes says if you smoke this,

1053
01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.500
it will be addictive and it could hurt you.

1054
01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:09.330
I just think we need to start talking more about things.
And so for me,
like,

1055
01:04:09.331 --> 01:04:14.190
you know,
I don't like,
I don't know,
man.
I just,

1056
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:19.700
I saw that I wouldn't have the good things in life because of this one thing

1057
01:04:19.921 --> 01:04:24.900
that had taken over.
And I,
my cousin actually,

1058
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:28.160
uh,
in 28,
2017 and 2017,

1059
01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.530
my cousin who I grew up with killed himself,
not with,

1060
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.990
and I don't mean killed himself as in like committed suicide.

1061
01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:37.950
And he just drugged himself to death and he was addicted to,

1062
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:42.060
it was addictive.
He was addicted to it and we never,

1063
01:04:42.061 --> 01:04:44.580
I never figured it out and I had to stop hanging out with them.

1064
01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.840
And that was what was happening to me too.
My,
we call her,
you know,

1065
01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:51.720
whether you think it's weird or Fufu or whatever you want to call it.

1066
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.280
We do Kelly and I do believe we're soul mates and that's weird.

1067
01:04:56.281 --> 01:04:59.430
And frou Frou yes,
but you can do it.
Yeah.
Well thank you.
Right.

1068
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.600
And that's the thing.
So if you're,

1069
01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.120
if the person who you think you were put on the planet to be with says,

1070
01:05:06.121 --> 01:05:10.080
I can't be with you the way you are,
that's hey man.

1071
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.970
Like you got to take a serious look.

1072
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:17.260
And so it sounds like that really was the critical thought in your head that the

1073
01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:22.261
person that you cared the most about at this moment in time is literally going

1074
01:05:22.771 --> 01:05:27.310
to walk away.
She had can't push it away.
I saw it.
I was like,

1075
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:32.080
I had to go to rehab to give her a break and to give my kids a break.

1076
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.690
When you went to Rehab,
did you say to yourself,
I'm going there.

1077
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.630
Did you go in there with the attitude of not Polish your boots and be the best

1078
01:05:38.631 --> 01:05:41.530
soldier?
You can bet.
If I didn't finish that.
Sorry.
I have an Adhd.

1079
01:05:41.531 --> 01:05:46.210
If he can't tell.
But,
um,
I went in there polished boots,

1080
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.870
pressed uniform.
I like,
I had my books,
I made my bed.

1081
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:53.590
It was all the basics.
Get back to the basics,
right.

1082
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:57.190
We even talked about this the first time I was on your show.
I shaved my head.

1083
01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:00.710
I started doing some,
you know,
started working out a little bit,

1084
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:02.290
trying to get back into the little bit of shape.

1085
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:05.800
I started caring about what I ate again.
I started taking my vitamins.
I started,

1086
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:06.670
you know,

1087
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:10.930
when I went in there and I know exactly what I'm like when I want to portray

1088
01:06:10.931 --> 01:06:12.040
that tough guy attitude.

1089
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:17.041
And that's what I did to keep people away at first because at first ever been

1090
01:06:17.801 --> 01:06:22.180
arrested?
Yes.
Where you've happy?
We happy about it.
No.
Yeah.

1091
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:27.040
So I kind of went in like I'd been arrested like I was the first time,

1092
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.150
not the second time that is in the book,
but the first,
anyway.
Um,
like I said,

1093
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:32.620
I don't put everything in the book,
but anyway,

1094
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.910
you're not very happy and you don't need friends.

1095
01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.790
So I didn't go in there to make friends.
So I was a,

1096
01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:42.130
I was like a wall for the first week.
Right.

1097
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.660
But that let me concentrate on exactly what I was there to do,

1098
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.670
if that makes sense.
And so as that,
as,
as,

1099
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:55.150
as I was there to get better and do Rehab got,
I don't want to say easier,

1100
01:06:55.151 --> 01:06:57.130
but I got better at it cause it's,
you know,

1101
01:06:57.131 --> 01:07:00.280
it's a skill that you are actually taught in rehab is how to be better.

1102
01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:04.140
That's what Rehab is there teaching you how to be better again.
So like what,

1103
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:08.780
what kind of skills are they teaching?
Wake up on time.
I know it sounds weird,

1104
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.040
but like,
you know,
when you're addicted,
it doesn't sound weird to me.

1105
01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:15.700
It's like basic training,
almost make,
get up,
make your bed,
you know,

1106
01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:19.000
come to breakfast on time.
So if you weren't at breakfast,

1107
01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.820
you lost your ability to make a phone call that night.

1108
01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.730
And then have you missed any classes during the day,
you know,

1109
01:07:24.731 --> 01:07:26.710
you'd have privileges,
you know,

1110
01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:31.570
given or taken as as the day or the week went by.
Now you're,
you're,

1111
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:34.690
you're at a place where you pay money to go,
so you'd think it'd be,

1112
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:38.230
how do you take privileges from someone?
But they do,
they do.
I was like,

1113
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.510
I'm a grown ass man.
If I want to make a phone call,
I bill.
They're like,

1114
01:07:40.511 --> 01:07:43.600
no you won't.
I'm like,
God damn it,
you're right.
Because I signed that waiver,

1115
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.070
but I,
I've tried so hard that I got to,
like,

1116
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:52.420
they were bringing me in,
you know,
I'm not,
I anyway,

1117
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:56.020
I should probably shouldn't say too much,
but like within,
you know,

1118
01:07:56.021 --> 01:07:59.680
I was only there 30 days,
but within about,
I'd say 15,
20 days,

1119
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:05.100
I was someone that was turned to buy the other clients and someone that some of

1120
01:08:05.171 --> 01:08:08.860
the staff would turn to,
to like for backup in a certain situation.

1121
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:13.390
Or like I said,
I went papa bear and,
but when I first got there,

1122
01:08:13.391 --> 01:08:15.980
some of the other clients told me,
like when I got there,
they were like,

1123
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.770
this guy is a murderer.
He's going to kill us all.
Like,

1124
01:08:18.771 --> 01:08:23.390
cause I was just so focused and I had this look on I,
you know,
I know,
you know,

1125
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:26.240
we're,
we're,
we get up in front of troops and try to,
you know,

1126
01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:29.360
we gotta be the toughest looking high there.
Some of them,
you know,

1127
01:08:29.361 --> 01:08:30.770
and so I know how to do it.

1128
01:08:30.771 --> 01:08:35.540
But I did that too for myself more than anything because I went,
okay,

1129
01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:36.830
I'm back in basic training,

1130
01:08:36.831 --> 01:08:41.270
I have to learn how to be a decent human being and how to look after myself

1131
01:08:41.271 --> 01:08:45.710
again and man,
and they took you through check checklists.
A lot of,

1132
01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:50.300
a lot of my personality flaws stem from childhood,
you know,
and I found that out.

1133
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:53.750
Like what?
Like stuff I don't want to talk about frankly.

1134
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:56.000
And you know,

1135
01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.980
just things that once you read the literature it's,
oh,

1136
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:03.320
that is obvious.
So you can,
you can,

1137
01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:06.500
and this is a conversation that we've been hard at and I didn't mean to be so

1138
01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:10.580
abrupt.
I'm not,
I'm not sure it's fine.
But what I mean is I now understand,

1139
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:15.050
and that's for me understanding like most guys like us and girls,

1140
01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:20.510
if I understand the cause,
I can,
I can deal with the action.

1141
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.170
Right?
So,
but if you don't understand that it's just chaos.

1142
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:27.290
But if there is an explanation as to why my mind goes there,

1143
01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:28.940
which then causes me these actions,
ah,

1144
01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:33.620
now I can go back and deal with the cause of that behavior.
Does that mean,

1145
01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.150
is that a better way of putting it?
Yeah,

1146
01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:36.600
<v 0>no it does.
It does make sense.</v>

1147
01:09:36.601 --> 01:09:41.190
And this is something that I just talked about on another podcast,

1148
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:45.600
but the first time I kind of recognize that there was these patterns in

1149
01:09:45.601 --> 01:09:50.601
protocols for a psychological issues is honestly when Jordan Peterson came on

1150
01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.540
for the first time and he was,
I was explaining how in the warrior kid book,

1151
01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.680
how the kid gets over the fear of the water and he goes,
oh yeah,
that's a,

1152
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:04.860
that's a protocol.
It's called exposure therapy.
And this is what I've done,

1153
01:10:04.861 --> 01:10:09.240
psychological,
this is how it works.
And I just figured that out from just life,

1154
01:10:09.241 --> 01:10:13.080
right?
Yeah.
And then I realized that the,

1155
01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:17.190
that there's protocols for problems and people have psychological problems.

1156
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:20.520
There's a pro and it's just an a,
and I was using the term brain mechanic,

1157
01:10:20.521 --> 01:10:23.310
but somebody on Twitter said something better,
which is mind mechanic.

1158
01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:27.540
So if I would've been told,
hey,
oh,
psychologist and a psychologist,

1159
01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:30.660
they're called a mind mechanic and they go in there and when there's problems,

1160
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:33.600
they know how to fix those problems.
I love that.
Yeah.

1161
01:10:33.601 --> 01:10:37.080
AndW but when you're well like me,
you're just thinking,
oh,

1162
01:10:37.081 --> 01:10:41.220
that's just a bunch of,
what'd you say earlier?
Fufu something Hippie dippy.
Yeah.

1163
01:10:41.221 --> 01:10:43.470
It's a bunch of hippy dippy stuff that you don't really know what's going on,

1164
01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:47.310
but then you talk to or,
or in talking to Jordan,
I heard him say,
oh,

1165
01:10:47.311 --> 01:10:49.980
and this is a problem that you would see and this is how you'd fix that problem.

1166
01:10:49.981 --> 01:10:52.200
Here's another problem over here and here's how you'd fix that problem.

1167
01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.680
And the really strange thing is it all lined up with just my natural instincts

1168
01:10:58.230 --> 01:10:59.820
when somebody had this kind of problem.
And be like,
okay,

1169
01:10:59.821 --> 01:11:01.140
here's what you need to do.
In that scenario.

1170
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:06.030
I would just know that from dealing with a bunch of guys over the past 30 years

1171
01:11:06.031 --> 01:11:08.820
that were having issues and be like,
hey man,
oh,
you got this problem,

1172
01:11:08.821 --> 01:11:12.000
here's what you need to do,
move,
do this,
do that.

1173
01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.100
But a psychologist,

1174
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:16.830
<v 2>a mind mechanic can look at and go,
here's what's going on,</v>

1175
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:21.090
here's what this root ties into and here's how you stop this,

1176
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:26.091
this cycle of negativity and how you move it in a positive direction yet.

1177
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.800
And that's exactly what Rehab is.

1178
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:33.830
It's let's find the co like you're not a bad person for having these thoughts

1179
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:39.570
and actions and reactions because you know,
and that's,

1180
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.030
and then,
oh,
here's why.
Oh,
okay.

1181
01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:46.020
Here's where the pattern developed when you were like five or 10 or then this

1182
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:49.200
happened and your buddy that we were talking about before the show,
uh,

1183
01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.450
Jay Redmond yet honestly,

1184
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:54.360
I'd love to talk to them because it sounds like him and I probably had very

1185
01:11:54.361 --> 01:11:57.990
similar childhoods.
And then similar careers,

1186
01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.920
you guys definitely had similar careers for the fact that you got sent back to

1187
01:12:01.921 --> 01:12:06.030
whatever that title school battle school and Jay read me God sent to ranger

1188
01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:10.710
school,
you know,
and then it's,
it's very,
you guys definitely had some similar,

1189
01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.950
I think I was a little more humble than him from the sounds of it,
but I'm just,

1190
01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:16.460
I don't know,
but I,
but I was still owed,
like

1191
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.470
I almost got kicked out of snipers for being arrogant.
It's,
it's a close race.

1192
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:25.420
And it was because I didn't say,
uh,

1193
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.860
I said Sir to the sergeant major instead of calling him by his first name,

1194
01:12:28.861 --> 01:12:31.110
cause he liked to be called by his first name by the snipers.

1195
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:34.350
Cause then it showed he was bros with us.
Yeah.
Whatever.
I'll see.

1196
01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:39.300
Am I showing my arrogance?
Maybe right now?
Yes.
Yeah.
No,
but it's,

1197
01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.190
but that's the thing is Jay Redmond,
you know,

1198
01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:45.180
he went through all that and his book is phenomenal because I'd love to read

1199
01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:45.301
this,

1200
01:12:45.301 --> 01:12:50.301
comes right out and explains all these mistakes that he made and he did a great

1201
01:12:50.311 --> 01:12:53.120
job,
redeem,
noose off and turn it into a great,
great frogmen.

1202
01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:55.140
And that's what I wanted and that's my job,
my book.

1203
01:12:55.141 --> 01:12:59.670
Unflinching it wasn't a let's make Jody,
you look like a hero.
It was like,

1204
01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:03.180
let's be honest and clear about how,
you know,

1205
01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:07.710
you start one one's place and ended up in another,
but you have to,
you know,

1206
01:13:07.711 --> 01:13:11.850
you have to realize that mistakes happen and you know,

1207
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.090
being 40,
you know,
and by,
by 42 as a kid,

1208
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:19.920
I thought I'd have it all together,
but uh,
you know,

1209
01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:23.460
I'm still learning.
I'm still,
you know,
like a,
I call myself a student,

1210
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:28.440
a student of the human condition because I feel like I'm always learning and I

1211
01:13:28.441 --> 01:13:31.500
will never,
no one's ever an expert on anything.
I don't think.

1212
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:33.120
And if you click can think you are,

1213
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:35.430
it means you've stopped learning in my opinion.
I don't know.

1214
01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:39.060
I know we're going a little off.
What are the withdrawal?

1215
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:42.980
How bad is the withdraw from?
Because I know,
you know,

1216
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:47.490
I think the only thing that you not supposed to withdraw on your own is alcohol

1217
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:51.840
cause you can actually die if you're an alcohol addict and you stop cold Turkey.

1218
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:55.330
Yeah,
you can.
If you're shy,
if you're deep into it,
you can have,
um,

1219
01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:59.910
I quit oxycotton cold Turkey and when I told my doctor,

1220
01:13:59.911 --> 01:14:03.750
he said I coulda had seizures and stuff and could have died,

1221
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:08.940
but it wasn't on that high dose then either.
So it's um,

1222
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:13.360
what about when you quit drinking?
I didn't do well.
Not that big of a deal.
Yeah,

1223
01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:17.550
the alcohol,
you got to drink a lot,
a lot to be in that situation.

1224
01:14:17.551 --> 01:14:22.551
Like these guys who were like drinking the whole bottle of vodka every day.

1225
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:28.420
You don't ever see that movie leaving Las Vegas with Nic Cage?
No.
Like that guy.

1226
01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:32.080
Like he would go grocery shopping and his car every day in his cart was full of

1227
01:14:32.081 --> 01:14:36.220
booze.
That's,
which is actually more common than I thought.
Oh Bro.

1228
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:38.950
It's crazy.
Some guys get after it with a,

1229
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:43.300
with a bug and their vodka for some reason cause they think you can't smell it.

1230
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.510
Yeah.
But I mean if you drink enough you can smell it.
Yeah.
Uh,

1231
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.760
but uh,
but the withdrawals were,
is it,

1232
01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:55.340
is it mostly psychological?
Yeah,
big time psychological.
Uh,

1233
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.790
there's some physical at first.
Um,
your boss,

1234
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.650
I went through a period where my body was like detoxing.

1235
01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:07.120
So like I was getting these weird zits on in like weird places and stuff like

1236
01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:11.110
that.
And,
and um,
uh,
is this from the cocaine?

1237
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:16.630
Yeah,
it's from the impurities that they get mixed with.
Right.

1238
01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:19.690
But then as far as detox or you're talking about detox and from cocaine?
Yeah,

1239
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:22.720
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Sorry.
Um,
yeah,

1240
01:15:22.721 --> 01:15:27.520
but I mean it's more just like letting your brain re level re level itself.

1241
01:15:27.521 --> 01:15:30.580
So I went in there,
I stopped taking any Tylenol,
like I don't take,

1242
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:35.410
I'm trying to,
and I,
Kelly and I are working on this.
We're trying to get,
like,

1243
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.570
we're almost sugars,
almost gone.
Uh,
I,

1244
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.790
I don't take any pills or I keep going away from the mic.
Um,

1245
01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.200
where,
where are we babe?
I,

1246
01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.010
we were in West Virginia doing some training or not training.

1247
01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:51.630
We were doing some familiarization at a place,
uh,

1248
01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:55.510
built for three letter agencies.
And um,
my,

1249
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.470
my leg was just on fire because of the day we'd had and she gave me two Tylenol

1250
01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:03.580
and to leave and I,
I passed out like,
like that I could,

1251
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.400
I didn't know that was in the morning.
Yeah.
Sorry.

1252
01:16:06.401 --> 01:16:11.260
I fell back to sleep cause I woke up with the pain anyway.
Uh,
that's what I want.

1253
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.410
I remember the first time I took a Tylenol and I was in,

1254
01:16:14.411 --> 01:16:19.360
cause after I joined the army and we're on exercise maybe a year later and I was

1255
01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:22.060
in the woods and my back was a little sore so the medic gave me two extra

1256
01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:25.870
strength.
Tylenol.
I just never had Tylenol before cause I just,
I,
you know,

1257
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:26.680
I was 17,

1258
01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:31.680
18 and I took it and my body felt like it was on Unicorns and sunshine for like

1259
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:35.410
three days.
And that was from two extra strength Tylenol.

1260
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:40.240
When you're doing blow and,
and drinking a lot,
like your breakfast,
you know,

1261
01:16:40.241 --> 01:16:41.180
to get over it.
And,

1262
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:46.320
and I like that if I take one Tylenol now my body's okay.

1263
01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.510
You know,
cause I'm a big guy,
so I need,
you know,
I usually go extra strength.

1264
01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.460
I wanna,
I wanna be able to take regular strengths.

1265
01:16:51.461 --> 01:16:55.540
Remember that everybody took regular strength,
anything.
Um,
you know,

1266
01:16:55.541 --> 01:17:00.220
I have a coffee and I feel it.
It's not just like a whatever anymore.

1267
01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:05.050
Um,
so that's kind of what I'm on a bit of a mission to get back to really basic

1268
01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:08.800
food and liquid intake.
Um,

1269
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:10.130
you like the cold brew

1270
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.620
<v 0>that I was drinking and when we got here,
like there's nothing else in it.</v>

1271
01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:15.950
It's just coffee,
eh,
that had the nitrogen in it.
Right?

1272
01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:19.460
But there's no sugar in Oak.
You know,
I'll put a little cream in my coffee now.

1273
01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.330
Um,
instead of extra larges.
Right.
We're trying to unbind mediums and small,

1274
01:17:23.331 --> 01:17:28.130
so we're trying to just get,
get back down to a baseline of,
of a,
of minimum.

1275
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:32.570
And uh,
it's working okay.
But you know,
it's a daily,

1276
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:37.640
I talked to my rehab guy at least once a week still.
Um,

1277
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.240
you know,
I sent him pictures of our travels and stuff,
you know,
we got the dog,

1278
01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:45.140
I got the service dog now does this lake,
you know,
they're so busy,

1279
01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:48.470
like she's such a,
she's a German shepherd malinois mix.

1280
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:51.850
There's such busy dogs that like you just,
you don't have time to,
to,

1281
01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:55.490
to be hung over or anything.
So,
and um,

1282
01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.470
like you could drink it on your own anyway,
right?

1283
01:17:57.471 --> 01:18:00.050
Like you're like as long time ago.
Well,
yeah.

1284
01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:02.880
So what happened with me is I just retired from the navy and,

1285
01:18:02.881 --> 01:18:07.060
and while while I was in the navy was pretty normal tubes to drain can,

1286
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:09.500
we've talked to him.
But when I retired,

1287
01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:14.000
I just looked up a month later and it hadn't had anything to drink that I looked

1288
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:16.700
up three months later and I hadn't had anything to drink that I looked up six

1289
01:18:16.701 --> 01:18:20.960
months later and I was like,
man,
I have no desire now.
And I must say,

1290
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.770
you know,
you talked about how not having an addictive personality,

1291
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.980
and I think I truly do not have an addictive personality.

1292
01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:32.360
I think that other than maybe like something like Jujitsu or something like
that,

1293
01:18:32.361 --> 01:18:36.620
which I definitely got pretty fanatic about and I still have a hard time with

1294
01:18:36.621 --> 01:18:40.280
withdrawals if I don't get to train for a certain amount of time.

1295
01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:43.100
What did dean say?
You're the,
Oh yeah.

1296
01:18:43.101 --> 01:18:46.820
And Dean lister one time said I was addicted to power.

1297
01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:51.020
So domination.
Yeah.
You know,
I was,

1298
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:57.030
I was giving him a hard time about not training and hassling him and telling me,

1299
01:18:57.351 --> 01:19:01.160
you know,
you're,
you're just addicted to that now.
And he said,
you're an addict,

1300
01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:04.640
you're an addict too.
And I said,
what am I addicted to?
And he says,
you're,

1301
01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:09.460
you're addicted to power,
but a,
Eh,

1302
01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.090
if you can do it on the,
and the,

1303
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.910
on the mats better than becoming like a dictator or something.

1304
01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:19.030
But the point is for me is when I,
I,

1305
01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.160
I never even like I would see maybe in my mid twenties I would get fired up

1306
01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:30.500
like,
hey,
like my platoon,
it would be the end,
it would be a Friday.

1307
01:19:30.501 --> 01:19:34.010
And we just got done with some hard training and we were in some random city and

1308
01:19:34.011 --> 01:19:36.170
it'd be like,
Oh yeah,
we're going to go on and have a good time tonight.

1309
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:37.430
And it was more about like,
Hey,

1310
01:19:37.431 --> 01:19:39.800
I know we're not going to have a good time about tonight.
Did it was like,

1311
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:44.150
I really need a beer.
Yeah,
me too.
And so as I did that,

1312
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:46.640
that was just kind of normal and there was definitely,

1313
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.170
the problem with that attitude is there are people that have addictive

1314
01:19:51.171 --> 01:19:52.400
personalities in alcohol,

1315
01:19:52.401 --> 01:19:55.370
has ruined all kinds of guys in the seal teams and all kinds of guys in the

1316
01:19:55.371 --> 01:20:00.080
military because it's really,
it's just a slippery slope to go from,
Oh,

1317
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:04.160
and this is just normal to,
hey,
it's Tuesday night,

1318
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:07.800
I'm at home,
I'm alone and I'm going to drink a 12 pack.

1319
01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:12.180
That's a pretty Slippy slippery slope that people,
people get through.

1320
01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:15.900
Actually just having Jason Gardner on and he,
he was,

1321
01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:19.450
he quit drinking just like maybe,
I don't know,
a couple months ago.
Yeah.

1322
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.200
But you know,
I said,
well,
how much were you drinking?
He goes,
you know,

1323
01:20:22.201 --> 01:20:26.610
and I'd come home and I'd crack one open and then I'd crack one open before

1324
01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:27.810
dinner and then I'd have one during dinner.

1325
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:30.150
Then I'll have one after dinner and then maybe we'd have one before I go to bed.

1326
01:20:30.151 --> 01:20:35.130
Well,
there's six beers and he's not a big guy.
So six beers is like,
you know,

1327
01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:40.050
he's good.
And he's even said like,
oh,
I would feel it,
you know,
not feel it.
Like,

1328
01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:45.090
you know,
he's still doing everything he has to,
but he's not doing it optimally.

1329
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.490
And now he said he could sick.
I feel just amazing that,
that,

1330
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:52.110
and that's pretty much how Jason talks.
So he says,
I feel amazing now,

1331
01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.490
but he's one of those guys that,
you know,

1332
01:20:56.491 --> 01:20:59.880
you could go down that slippery slope and he wasn't far down it,

1333
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:02.190
but he would look up every night and call,
you know,
cause when you wake up,

1334
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:05.220
let's face it,
you ever six beers,
you don't feel as good as if you had no beers.

1335
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.790
And that's something you talked about that go,
yeah,

1336
01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:09.360
I remember that you were talking about drinking too much vodka or something

1337
01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:13.140
fully.
Yeah.
Next day you feel like the brakes,
the thing,

1338
01:21:13.141 --> 01:21:17.070
like you wake up and you feel foggy and like,
you know,

1339
01:21:17.071 --> 01:21:22.050
like three days are wasted if you do too much.
Any of anything,
you know,

1340
01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:25.720
like you could,
who knows?
But,
um,
to put,
you know,

1341
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:30.410
I knew guys that woke up and drank whiskey with breakfast,
you know,

1342
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:35.370
but it was so accepted in our world as well that it was,
you know,

1343
01:21:35.371 --> 01:21:39.460
if you showed up for PT and you were hung over,
it was a joke,
right?
Yeah.

1344
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:44.280
What's up Jodie?
You,
it feels,
it was a badge of honor.
It was a badge of honor.

1345
01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:46.950
Like,
Oh yeah,
this guy's drunk.
Wow.
Look at how well this guy can run.

1346
01:21:46.951 --> 01:21:48.780
Even though he's hammered running,

1347
01:21:48.781 --> 01:21:51.830
even though he's like throwing up on the moves.
That's soldier right there.

1348
01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.770
There's an old seal master chief at seal team one before I got there and old

1349
01:21:55.771 --> 01:21:57.780
Vietnam guy and when you went in and talked to him,

1350
01:21:57.781 --> 01:22:00.540
he would pour shots of Tequila.
That's how it was going to be like,
oh,

1351
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.910
it's nine o'clock in the morning.
Cool.
You want to talk to me?

1352
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:06.810
Roger that school in shots,
old school and that's again,

1353
01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.920
there's people that can handle that and there's people that can't and broadly

1354
01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:14.370
speaking,
let's face it,
and this is what I eventually thought to myself.

1355
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:18.060
Broadly speaking,
it made no,
it makes no sense whatsoever to me.

1356
01:22:18.061 --> 01:22:20.520
Now as I look back,
I'm like,
this makes no sense to me.

1357
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:23.580
This does absolutely nothing positive for me.
It doesn't make me stronger.

1358
01:22:23.581 --> 01:22:25.920
It doesn't make me smarter.
In fact,
it does.

1359
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:28.200
The opposite makes you weaker and makes you dumber.

1360
01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:32.130
But it took me a long time to figure that out.

1361
01:22:32.131 --> 01:22:34.200
And weird thing for me is when I was a kid growing up,

1362
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.170
I was into hardcore music and like the straight edge scene of people,

1363
01:22:38.171 --> 01:22:41.400
not the x is on your hand.
I didn't actually have that,
but uh,

1364
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.310
but I definitely listened to that music and it was,
it,

1365
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:49.320
it had an influence on me without a doubt had an influence on me because it was,

1366
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:50.543
it was,

1367
01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:56.340
it was a rebellion in account or to the kids that I knew that were getting drunk

1368
01:22:56.341 --> 01:23:00.450
and acting stupid and smoking pot and I'm over here going literally thinking

1369
01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.470
you're weak and I'm strong.
Yeah.
That's an arrogant thing to say.
But that's as a,

1370
01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:06.670
as a 14 1516

1371
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:10.210
<v 2>year old kid when you're looking at someone else that's smoking pot and getting</v>

1372
01:23:10.211 --> 01:23:12.640
drunk and you're thinking they're weak and I'm strong.

1373
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.920
That's kind of a positive thing as far as I'm concerned.
Yeah.

1374
01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.640
I remember getting called week when I didn't drink in the platoon.
Oh,

1375
01:23:18.641 --> 01:23:19.441
a hundred percent out.

1376
01:23:19.441 --> 01:23:24.040
But I grew up both sides of the family have their fair share of alcoholics.
Um,

1377
01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.490
even even as a kid,
I was someone who,
you know,
even though I'm Canadian,

1378
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:31.150
a Nancy Reagan say no to drugs worked.
Uh,
like I said,

1379
01:23:31.151 --> 01:23:34.750
I smoked hash a handful of times cause my buddy's mom was hot and she sold it.

1380
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:38.320
And um,
you know,
and then I didn't,

1381
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:42.490
I didn't touch anything except booze.
And even then it was like,
I was like,
you,

1382
01:23:42.491 --> 01:23:45.880
I was like,
I could go three months and not drink and just be like,

1383
01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:47.650
I haven't had a drink for like three months.
You know,

1384
01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:51.430
I quit cigarettes when we're on deployment because I couldn't run up the hill

1385
01:23:51.431 --> 01:23:54.230
next to the,
to our camp.
I was like,
fuck,
if I can't run up the hill,

1386
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.860
obviously these things.
And I was just something I picked up as a,

1387
01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:00.370
cause I watched lethal weapon too much.
Yeah,
right.
Mel Gibson.
Oh,
and then,

1388
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:03.900
and then Bruce Willis,
Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson,
all they did with smoking,

1389
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:05.500
their movies still smoke in movies right now.

1390
01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:09.610
Let go Charles a cutaway less way less.
Yeah,
I was watching that movie,

1391
01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:13.690
Constantine with Ken or eaves last night.
I just,
one of my favorite movies.

1392
01:24:13.691 --> 01:24:17.380
I Dunno.
Why Demons and devils.
I don't know.
I just liked that one.
But uh,

1393
01:24:17.381 --> 01:24:20.860
he smokes a lot,
but that's the character.
He dies a lung cancer and that,

1394
01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:24.340
that's part of the actual plot.
Yeah,
he actually has,

1395
01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:28.990
it actually has lung cancer in the movie anyway.
Yeah.

1396
01:24:28.991 --> 01:24:29.681
I just,
I,

1397
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:33.940
but I and I and the guy who told me about this anti addictive personality,

1398
01:24:33.941 --> 01:24:37.510
like in my twenties so I kind of skated on that.

1399
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:42.950
You felt like that was more reinforcement for your personality but also like I

1400
01:24:42.971 --> 01:24:45.680
quit smoking and drinking,
honestly,
dude,
like it,

1401
01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.700
I said it was a problem because at the time it was,

1402
01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:53.290
but it was because I was doing all the coke cause and it levels you and I could

1403
01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:56.100
drink on New Year's Eve a Kell,
like she was like,
I don't want to drink anymore,

1404
01:24:56.110 --> 01:24:58.570
but it helps you to not do coke.
And I was like,
all right,
awesome.

1405
01:24:58.571 --> 01:25:03.220
So we quit drinking,
but that the cocaine just wouldn't let go.

1406
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:04.241
And again,

1407
01:25:04.241 --> 01:25:07.060
I'd go through like a week where I wouldn't do it and then had a week where I

1408
01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:10.300
did it and then,
you know,
but eventually,
like you said,
your buddy,

1409
01:25:10.301 --> 01:25:12.790
you didn't hit his bottom wasn't they gave bottom,

1410
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:17.350
you know what I was thinking about,
uh,
your bottom is whatever you want it to be.

1411
01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:22.940
And uh,
and so I,
I saw the bottom coming for,

1412
01:25:22.941 --> 01:25:26.950
for the whole,
for like the whole time,
pretty much 2017.

1413
01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:30.910
I didn't for a lot of it,
uh,
but near the end it was,

1414
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.860
it was clear that there was a problem.

1415
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.250
Like I still didn't really see the problem until I was doing those interviews.

1416
01:25:36.251 --> 01:25:38.590
And then right before I saw you,
but then 2018,

1417
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:41.950
it was trying to level out and figure out which way was up,
which are,

1418
01:25:41.951 --> 01:25:45.370
it was down again,
you know,
and,
uh,
you know,

1419
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:49.270
don't be afraid to call in reinforcements like we talked about last time.
Like,

1420
01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.410
no,
no one is a rock.
No one's an island.
Right.

1421
01:25:53.411 --> 01:25:57.970
Like you don't like Rambo to isn't real.
Right.
As,
as cool as a movie character.

1422
01:25:57.971 --> 01:26:02.620
He is.
Um,
he has air support.
He has,
you know,
he has a fire team.

1423
01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:05.990
He has a,
he has that machine gun team on the flank.
He's got,
you know,
he's got,

1424
01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:10.520
uh,
indirect on it.
Standby.
Like no one is a one man army.

1425
01:26:10.521 --> 01:26:12.350
And you know,
and I,

1426
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.290
I talked about this last time and I talked about it the first time I was on the

1427
01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:19.970
show and I keep relearning these things,
but in different contexts.
And,

1428
01:26:19.971 --> 01:26:24.020
you know,
I'm,
I hope I'm done learning,
uh,
these,
these lessons.

1429
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:29.360
Um,
you know,
uh,
and I want to get back to just live in positive,
clean.

1430
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:33.470
Um,
you know,
I've,
I'm repeating myself now,
but dude,

1431
01:26:33.471 --> 01:26:37.880
like it was rough and I honestly,
I questioned whether or not like,

1432
01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:42.500
you know,
like people like you or people,
uh,
in Canada,
there's some of my friends,

1433
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:46.110
like,
are they going to accept what I'm dishonest.

1434
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:50.570
But I was prepared for the consequences too because that's,

1435
01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:55.580
I felt like what I deserved with my actions.
Does that make sense?
Okay.

1436
01:26:56.150 --> 01:27:00.210
And,
and,
uh,
for the most part,
like I said,
everyone's been understanding like,

1437
01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.920
and it makes it easier for me to talk about,
you know,
one of the reasons I,
I've,

1438
01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.810
I've talked with about with my psychologist,

1439
01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:13.790
why I didn't get PTSD from my injuries is cause I talked about it so much.

1440
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:18.680
So I'm hoping that talking about this openly and if,
if,

1441
01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.800
if more listeners to the show and you know,
um,

1442
01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:26.510
if you go to my show to Jody Mitic podcast,
episode 39,

1443
01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:29.000
I believe is full disclosure,
where I tried to,

1444
01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:32.960
I tried to lay it all out even more than we have here.
Um,

1445
01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.620
and it feels better every time I tell the story,
you know,

1446
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:41.180
and it's a lot to get into like an hour or two.
It is really,
but,
you know,

1447
01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.160
with us,
it's almost like an evolution,
right?
The first show we did good.

1448
01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:48.620
But you know,
even back then,
like if things were,

1449
01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:53.390
things were getting to be a little dicey with the politics and the home life and

1450
01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:57.680
stuff.
But,
and man,
I,
I just,
and you know,

1451
01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:03.100
I did go through a period where losing my legs became a real problem there in

1452
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:05.300
Kelly's nodding her head because she saw it,
you know,

1453
01:28:05.301 --> 01:28:08.630
like when I couldn't wear my legs,
I couldn't drive my car.

1454
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.160
I know I drove here last time,

1455
01:28:10.161 --> 01:28:13.700
but I had with the hand controls when I first took the legs off that I didn't

1456
01:28:13.701 --> 01:28:17.810
have that I was in an apartment by myself.
Um,

1457
01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:22.310
you know,
and anyway,
I just,
you know,
uh,
here I am.

1458
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:28.070
Do you,
you know,
the dog's coming up cause you can feel,

1459
01:28:28.071 --> 01:28:32.600
I'm getting a little worked up right now.
How hard day to day

1460
01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:35.960
are you thinking to yourself?

1461
01:28:35.961 --> 01:28:40.961
Like what's the temptations level daily where you have your friend that delivers

1462
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:43.620
of,
right.
Right now none.

1463
01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:49.380
So how hard is it on like a day to day basis?

1464
01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:55.130
What's the temptation like?
Um,
at first it was massive.

1465
01:28:55.190 --> 01:29:00.120
Like I would,
um,
you know,
that show Narcos,
I can't,
I can't,

1466
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:04.360
I haven't,
you know,
on,
you know,
the shoe and Argos,
it's about Pablo Escobar.
Okay.

1467
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:08.250
So they just came out with season two,
which is now the Mexican cartels.
Mm.

1468
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.900
I haven't watched a single episode.

1469
01:29:10.410 --> 01:29:15.410
We were watching pulp fiction and I had to turn it off when the,

1470
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:21.870
what's her name did a line of coke beef when John Travolta was picking her up

1471
01:29:21.871 --> 01:29:23.990
like that is like I could,

1472
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:29.030
I even now I avoid anything that has drugs in it for the most part.

1473
01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.290
Um,
and I,
and at first it was,
and even when I was using,

1474
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:37.380
like if I was on a role where I was like two or three or four days where I

1475
01:29:37.381 --> 01:29:40.800
hadn't used,
if I put on a show like Scarface,
I was like,

1476
01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:45.500
oh you can't watch Scarface sober.
You know,
he's delivering a baller,

1477
01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:49.530
you know,
in a case of whiskey.
But,
um,
you know,

1478
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:54.450
as time has gone by and Kelly and I are finding more positive things like HQ is

1479
01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:55.980
happening like I,

1480
01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:59.580
we call it HQ cause its headquarters for everything that we're going to do for

1481
01:29:59.581 --> 01:30:03.540
the future.
And we just started,
uh,
you know,

1482
01:30:03.541 --> 01:30:07.350
we're trying to start a home business called fire team Alpha where we're fire

1483
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:11.160
team alpha.
I don't know how you guys designate in the seals,

1484
01:30:11.161 --> 01:30:15.780
but for us in a section you have fire team,
Alpha,
Bravo,
Charlie Delta.
Uh,

1485
01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:20.730
so we're fire team Alpha within the section and we want to help other couples

1486
01:30:20.731 --> 01:30:23.400
and individuals,
right.
And our,

1487
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:27.040
our life coaching is going to involve some tactical flavor,
you know,

1488
01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:31.350
shooting if you want to think of that.
But,
um,
so,
you know,

1489
01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:36.290
like we're doing it and the closer we do it and the more steps we take,
the,

1490
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:38.790
the,
it's,
I,
you know,
we were,

1491
01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:41.730
last night we were driving here from La and we were like,

1492
01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:46.230
we were both just kind of like,
remember,
like three months ago,

1493
01:30:46.231 --> 01:30:48.990
it feels like forever ago.
You know,

1494
01:30:48.991 --> 01:30:52.410
like I remember I used to be addicted to cocaine and she's like,

1495
01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:56.400
what do mean used to be,
right?
Like it's a bit of a reminder,
but for me,

1496
01:30:56.401 --> 01:30:58.530
I don't even know that guy anymore,
you know?

1497
01:30:58.531 --> 01:31:02.760
But that was just me back in December.
And I liked that.

1498
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:05.910
I liked that I was in rehab with people that have,

1499
01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:10.980
this is their fifth time and that scared the shit out of me.
I was like,

1500
01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:14.100
what do mean your fifth time?
And then this other guy,
you know,

1501
01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:17.520
and they're all in their twenties and they've been to rehab three,
four,
five,

1502
01:31:17.521 --> 01:31:19.170
six times.
I'm like,
damn,

1503
01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.320
I need to figure out a way to Aa and never be here again.

1504
01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:26.550
And B help you guys never come here again.
You know.

1505
01:31:26.551 --> 01:31:30.600
So we're even setting up a system with the rehab place because a,
it's a,
it's a,

1506
01:31:30.601 --> 01:31:32.160
it's a good place if actually,

1507
01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:35.070
and it takes people from American candidates called Thousand Islands Rehab.

1508
01:31:35.071 --> 01:31:38.790
It's rate on the border where there with the Saint Lawrence.
Um,

1509
01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:44.330
we are working on a system where as people cause transitional housing from Rehab

1510
01:31:45.481 --> 01:31:49.640
to normal life is a bit of a problem.
So we are setting up,
uh,

1511
01:31:49.650 --> 01:31:52.560
once we have the headquarters built and everything by the end of the year,

1512
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:56.370
by next year we're hoping to have like three or four bucks set up where we can

1513
01:31:56.371 --> 01:31:59.230
bring in likeminded people from Rehab.

1514
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.500
You already have a building for HQ or you're working on?
We're really,

1515
01:32:02.501 --> 01:32:06.670
we're working on it.
Where he close.
We think we have something.
I have,
we are,
uh,

1516
01:32:06.690 --> 01:32:09.880
I am moving to Stittsville from Orleans in Ottawa.

1517
01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:14.530
That means going from the Far East end of the far west end.
Um,
we're very close.

1518
01:32:14.531 --> 01:32:18.960
I don't want to let the cat out of the bag in case,
uh,
like bet.

1519
01:32:18.961 --> 01:32:20.490
The guys that are helping me are,

1520
01:32:20.491 --> 01:32:25.420
are really guys I met in politics actually and they're really great guys and

1521
01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:27.670
they see,
you know,
they,

1522
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:30.280
they've never held anything against me for what I've done.

1523
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:33.550
And if anything there at 42,

1524
01:32:33.551 --> 01:32:38.470
it kind of sucks to be starting over again and better than the alternative.

1525
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:41.050
But it's better than the alternative.
And,
you know,

1526
01:32:41.051 --> 01:32:44.680
I could've stayed in politics and,
and you know,

1527
01:32:44.681 --> 01:32:49.120
it's $110,000 a year job,
which is great and stuff.
But,

1528
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.960
um,

1529
01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:54.960
I quit a job in the 90s where I as making like 65 grand a year in the nineties

1530
01:32:57.131 --> 01:33:01.420
as an 18 year old putting things together for Ford,
uh,

1531
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:02.740
making way too much money,

1532
01:33:02.741 --> 01:33:07.120
stupid money for an 19 year old because I wanted to join the army and I went

1533
01:33:07.121 --> 01:33:12.121
from 850 bucks a week to five 20 every two weeks.

1534
01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:15.820
And I loved it.
And that's what Kelly and I are doing now.

1535
01:33:15.821 --> 01:33:20.470
We are spiritually rich and we are,
I know we want more,

1536
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:21.370
we're getting greedy,

1537
01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:26.050
we want more in fulfillment and enrichment in our lives and we will just want to

1538
01:33:26.051 --> 01:33:27.340
surround ourselves with good people.

1539
01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.600
<v 0>Well,
yeah.
You know,
and and you said earlier,
and I held onto the thought,</v>

1540
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:36.490
you said,
hey,
you know,
you got to take care of yourself first,
but you also,

1541
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:40.090
and that's that there is definite truth to that because if you don't take care

1542
01:33:40.091 --> 01:33:41.800
of yourself,
you're not going to able to help anyone else.

1543
01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:45.160
But I'm telling you and a,
you already know,

1544
01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:46.390
cause this is what you're talking about.

1545
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:49.630
You can take care of yourself once you got yourself under control.

1546
01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:53.170
There's no better reward in life than helping other people and moving people in

1547
01:33:53.171 --> 01:33:57.880
the right direction and helping people find the path.
So well,
I mean,

1548
01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:01.850
<v 2>even through all these troubles we talked about right before the show,</v>

1549
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:06.470
the recruiting depot for the Canadian armed forces called me.

1550
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:11.990
And I don't even think I was at a rehab yet,
was I babe?
No.
And I,

1551
01:34:11.991 --> 01:34:16.790
and like I said,
I wasn't shy,
but what was going on and,
and uh,

1552
01:34:16.810 --> 01:34:20.170
the top shot from every platoon now,
uh,

1553
01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:23.930
going through d through our recruitment depot is going to get the mass corporal

1554
01:34:23.931 --> 01:34:28.670
Jody Mitic top shot award.
There's no greater honor.

1555
01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:32.750
And I get to go and give a speech now to these troopers,

1556
01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:37.520
these young troops as they leave,
recruit bag leave there.
Now soldiers,

1557
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:41.660
they've finished basic training and I get to go and tell them like,
hey,

1558
01:34:41.661 --> 01:34:45.230
look at me.
Look at what I did and I'm a complete fuck up.

1559
01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:49.010
But you know,
it's who you are on the inside.

1560
01:34:49.011 --> 01:34:50.900
It's how you would redeem yourself.

1561
01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:54.770
And it's how you look after those around you that makes you who you are.

1562
01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:56.720
At least that's what I think.
Look,

1563
01:34:57.070 --> 01:35:01.460
and here I am giving you the speech less than three months after finishing rehab

1564
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:04.940
or just like three months after.
And you know what?
Hey,

1565
01:35:04.941 --> 01:35:09.380
as awesome as the congressional medal of honor or the Victoria Cross for me is

1566
01:35:10.190 --> 01:35:15.190
having something named after me that all the new troops see and some will point

1567
01:35:16.001 --> 01:35:20.540
at and go,
I fucking want that.
I want,
I want that award.
That's the best,

1568
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:24.920
greatest honor.
The military probably could have,
uh,
bestowed on me,
you know,

1569
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:29.720
to say you are someone we want our troops,
our youngest,

1570
01:35:29.721 --> 01:35:33.230
newest members to,
to aspire to be like,

1571
01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:39.380
man,
I got a job.
I got a job.
My job is did like to be that guy.

1572
01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.500
And,
and if,
if it means you screw up,

1573
01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:46.690
it means you own it and you dust yourself off and,
and you carry on.
You know,

1574
01:35:46.691 --> 01:35:48.800
again,
you find a way and you,
and you know what,

1575
01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.860
and that's all I'm going to keep doing.

1576
01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:54.050
That's why like friends like you and things like this,

1577
01:35:54.051 --> 01:35:58.370
podcasting in our generation is,
is how we,
how we do that.

1578
01:35:58.371 --> 01:35:59.780
And like,
again,
I,

1579
01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:04.580
I talking about it like I'm trying not to get emotional because there's a master

1580
01:36:04.581 --> 01:36:08.330
corporal Jody Mitic top shot award and it's not just at lake,

1581
01:36:08.331 --> 01:36:10.720
some unit mass hall,
you know,
like the,

1582
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.700
what every new recruit going through.

1583
01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:18.560
The depot is going to see this thing and uh,
and it's anyway,

1584
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.200
I don't know what else to say.
I'm speechless about it,
frankly.

1585
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:25.860
<v 0>Well,
that's awesome.
I mean,
that is,
that's just,</v>

1586
01:36:25.861 --> 01:36:27.790
that's just an awesome honor that,

1587
01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.720
that these young recruits are going to come in and they're going to every single

1588
01:36:30.721 --> 01:36:32.070
recruit in the Canadian army.

1589
01:36:32.071 --> 01:36:36.000
They're going to know who you are and what you represent and part of what

1590
01:36:36.001 --> 01:36:37.670
they're going to see of what you represent.
Once they,

1591
01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:41.370
once they know your story is they're going to realize that you're not perfect

1592
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:45.720
and they're going to realize that no one's perfect and they're going to realize

1593
01:36:45.721 --> 01:36:50.550
that they can get control over the things that have gotten out of control and

1594
01:36:50.551 --> 01:36:54.630
they can move forward in a positive way and make the absolute best out of what

1595
01:36:54.631 --> 01:36:56.050
they're doing with their life.
Like,

1596
01:36:56.150 --> 01:36:58.920
<v 2>I don't know about you,
but like something like that puts you in a,</v>

1597
01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.230
puts me in a position to be a mentor to these people.
Oh for sure.
It's,
and like,

1598
01:37:03.231 --> 01:37:05.540
same with like my,
my podcast,
you're a pot.

1599
01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:11.210
People come to you I'm sure out of the blue with lots of things and,

1600
01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.690
and it's it,
you know,
sometimes I,
you know,

1601
01:37:14.691 --> 01:37:17.830
I stopped responding for a while because of where I was,
but now I'm,

1602
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:21.590
I'm getting back.
Like I wear your tee shirts again,
bro.
Like I don't know,

1603
01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.100
did we say that?
Did we say that on the,
on the air?
I'm going to,

1604
01:37:25.101 --> 01:37:27.920
I want one of those before I leave.
You know,

1605
01:37:27.921 --> 01:37:32.360
because discipline does equal freedom and it doesn't mean you govern every

1606
01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:35.960
moment of your day,
but it means that more disciplined you are with yourself,

1607
01:37:35.961 --> 01:37:39.110
the more free you are to be yourself.
Does that make more?

1608
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:43.880
That's how I've always seen it.
And I've,
you know,

1609
01:37:43.881 --> 01:37:47.900
I feel like we're coming to a natural conclusion here.
Maybe I'm wrong,
but

1610
01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:52.430
thanks man.
Like both of you.
Like I just,
I,

1611
01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.980
I need people like you that guys,
I look up to you

1612
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.380
<v 0>man.
Like I know,
I know.
It's weird.
It's weird.</v>

1613
01:37:58.381 --> 01:38:02.900
It should be the other way around it.
No,
but I do,
man.
I want that top shot award

1614
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:09.330
and um,
you know,
you really,
you really helped me a lot,
you know,

1615
01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.570
and uh,
and I hope I can repay the favor one day and I,

1616
01:38:12.571 --> 01:38:17.100
and I know you say I don't know what yet,
but I,
I couldn't do,

1617
01:38:17.101 --> 01:38:21.270
I couldn't achieve what I'm doing now without the support of people like you in

1618
01:38:21.271 --> 01:38:24.630
my life and Echo.
Of course.
Well,
you're right,
you don't owe me anything.

1619
01:38:24.631 --> 01:38:28.260
And the only thing that I would like is for you to stay on the path and Roger

1620
01:38:28.261 --> 01:38:32.010
that moving forward and keep kicking ass and stay clean and keep doing what you

1621
01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:36.960
know you're capable of doing and what you're destined to do.
Good copy check.

1622
01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:42.040
All right.
I think that is a natural.
Can I just get a quick shout out to Warhol?

1623
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:45.270
This is the ward all tee shirt.
I think it's called the dream catcher.

1624
01:38:45.271 --> 01:38:47.790
He's a veteran and Canada.
Go ahead and look them up in order.

1625
01:38:47.791 --> 01:38:51.510
Some of his t shirts help him out at full.
Is it 20?

1626
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:55.920
I think 20% of his proceeds go to charity for veterans.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1627
01:38:56.010 --> 01:39:00.030
Warhol,
Warhol,
the ward all you got like a blog and he has some cool,

1628
01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:03.120
cool swag was going to dude.
He's a good dude.
Yeah.
That's pretty cool.

1629
01:39:03.121 --> 01:39:05.520
Looking tissue.
I noticed it on the weekend.
Yeah,
I'll,

1630
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:09.920
I'll have him send you some check.
Um,
Echo.
Yes.
You know,

1631
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:12.780
speaking of the path and whatnot,

1632
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:17.310
we see it's easy to slip off the path from time to time.
It is.

1633
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.600
We want to get back on the path if we want to stay on the path.
Recommendations.

1634
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:26.590
Sure.
From Echo Charles.
Well,
I recommend Jujitsu.

1635
01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:30.440
So Jujitsu as a strip.
So you were talking about,
um,

1636
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:34.260
what starting to judge you by the way.
I like that.
Good.
Yeah.

1637
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:38.210
So relieving stress.
You will have a good time with Jujitsu.
Yeah.

1638
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:42.570
I'm finally comfortable enough with my leg stumps that I feel like I can roll

1639
01:39:42.571 --> 01:39:44.010
with people that were feeling inadequate.

1640
01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:49.040
I've rolled with quite a few people with various stumps.

1641
01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:52.810
Yeah.
Yes.
Done.
Stumps,
stumps.

1642
01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.000
How we got Jeffrey Al here.
He's,

1643
01:39:56.050 --> 01:39:58.880
he's got no hand and he chokes you with that stump.

1644
01:39:58.890 --> 01:40:00.280
He's got a stump and he chokes you with it.

1645
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.370
Sticks it right into your Adam's apple in position.
Part of the game.

1646
01:40:05.371 --> 01:40:09.810
Yeah.
Yeah.
That'd be good to use it.
Yeah.
There's people,
no hands,
no legs both.

1647
01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:13.740
And I'm,
I'm finally able to deal with it.
And you're below the knee too,

1648
01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:16.290
so you can do Somalia.
There's all kinds of stuff.

1649
01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.820
All kinds of things can go down.
Oh yeah.
So yeah,
that's a good way.
Stress Relief.

1650
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.990
That's one of those ones that it's probably one of the biggest stress relievers

1651
01:40:24.991 --> 01:40:29.400
there is that I've had in my life is very,
you know,
simple.

1652
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:34.500
Even right when you begin,
he gets super stressed out as we know.

1653
01:40:34.510 --> 01:40:39.510
Sometimes you got the dishwasher oil sauce bowls to their spot or silverware or

1654
01:40:40.261 --> 01:40:42.120
whatever.
That's a tough decision.
You get stressed out.

1655
01:40:42.121 --> 01:40:45.000
Luckily you can do the Jujitsu to relieve that.
Anyway,

1656
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:48.360
I'd be stressed about the stage.
I did two a day yesterday.
I did two,

1657
01:40:48.361 --> 01:40:51.240
I did mornings you to afternoon,
Tuesday morning,
g evening.

1658
01:40:51.241 --> 01:40:54.040
Nogi what my stress level was

1659
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.330
<v 3>birthed.
It was so low.
All of this so stoked.
But that's it.
Yeah.</v>

1660
01:40:58.331 --> 01:41:02.700
I did one yesterday and I went and thought,
Dang,
okay.

1661
01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:08.380
Avoidance.
Well,
you know things or less,
how should I say,

1662
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:10.840
available as far as that Ken's,
you're working

1663
01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:16.240
doing various things.
There's less stress relief.

1664
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:20.500
Did you get to right where that's like a double,
maybe even a triple,

1665
01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:24.940
actually maybe even like an endless benefit situation,
Jujitsu,

1666
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:30.270
but as far as the stress,
mental stress relief.
Yes.
Yeah,
and it's,
it's soul.

1667
01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.340
You're going to like it and you actually,
you are going to hate it at first.

1668
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.750
Jimmy get choked.
Yup.

1669
01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:39.430
Big Dod doctor cared for that little little hundred and 20 pound people are

1670
01:41:39.431 --> 01:41:40.264
gonna choke you.

1671
01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:44.260
They're going to get an arm lock you and you're gonna think this is not fair,

1672
01:41:45.630 --> 01:41:46.960
but it's not fair.
They know.

1673
01:41:47.670 --> 01:41:50.550
I've been like a spectator of the community for so long.

1674
01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:52.950
Like before I got wounded,
I want,
I might put,

1675
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:57.790
my plan was to come home and actually like train and try and get a one MMA
fight.

1676
01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.930
Yeah.
Uh,

1677
01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.520
cause in Canada and like it wasn't that big a thing for 2006 and then,
you know,

1678
01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:07.870
the whole getting blown up thing.
But I'm fully prepared for the,

1679
01:42:07.871 --> 01:42:12.871
a humility that he brings because I need it frankly.

1680
01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:18.160
We all do.
If you look at it and since you're who you are and how you are,

1681
01:42:18.161 --> 01:42:21.700
you're gonna,
you're gonna have trouble avoiding the part that it's like,
yes,

1682
01:42:21.701 --> 01:42:26.050
this person is like beating me up in,
can you beat me up?
Even though the smaller,

1683
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.040
so you're going to eat,

1684
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:29.830
you're probably not gonna be able to avoid that element of,
of,
well,

1685
01:42:29.831 --> 01:42:31.690
I'm recording it.
It's a reaction.
It's a,

1686
01:42:31.691 --> 01:42:34.630
it's a common action reaction to what's happening.

1687
01:42:35.050 --> 01:42:39.430
So as long as I trained to prepare for that,
like if I train my mind,
right,
yes.

1688
01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:42.160
But it doesn't change that.
If Kelly chokes me out,

1689
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:46.840
I will feel inadequate for a while and that's,
that's,
so there's that part,

1690
01:42:46.841 --> 01:42:51.580
but it was a lie.
I feel a little bit more,
yeah,

1691
01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.590
there's an eternal blessing.

1692
01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:58.320
I don't turn red bottle plus there.

1693
01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:02.560
The other part of it is if you look at it as a problem solving situation,

1694
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.440
it's like,
okay,
he's not beating me up.
He is by the way.

1695
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:08.560
But you don't think of it like that.
You think,
okay,
this is the issue.

1696
01:43:08.561 --> 01:43:13.150
This is a problem.
Yes,
I've got to learn how to do that.
It'll take a while.

1697
01:43:13.151 --> 01:43:15.850
But in any puzzle situation,
you know,
okay,

1698
01:43:15.851 --> 01:43:17.120
I'm not going to learn this thing overnight.

1699
01:43:17.121 --> 01:43:21.770
It's like huge 5,000 piece puzzle and Jujitsu.
It's infinite.
But you know,
the,

1700
01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:25.560
you still look at it in that sort of way and then you can start to accept,
okay.

1701
01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:29.170
[inaudible] thing.
I really appeals to it.
Uh,
peel that.

1702
01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.590
What appeals about it to me is that even practitioners like a,

1703
01:43:32.591 --> 01:43:35.770
your guys is level like Jockos level or even,
what's his name?

1704
01:43:35.771 --> 01:43:40.190
The guy who knows how he separated us.
Even added percent.

1705
01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:43.690
You're like 12 or something.
Like what's the guy,
Gracie,

1706
01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:47.540
even he says he learns every day and that's what I appeal.

1707
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:50.920
It appeals to me because there's,
there's no true experts.

1708
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.080
I mean there are people that will kick your ass in every day,
but they even,

1709
01:43:54.081 --> 01:43:57.080
they have someone that could kick.
They're always learning.
Yes.

1710
01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.860
So when you do Jujitsu,
Jody,
medic and Jocko,

1711
01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:06.350
you are going to need a g cause you gotta do gete and Nogi got to do both,

1712
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:10.670
I think with fully stay on the path.
100% both.

1713
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.620
So you need to g you get an origin geek.

1714
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:14.930
We don't gotta ask what kind of gateway again now you know,

1715
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:18.740
origin get you saw that one.
I just got you got one for me?
Yeah,
we will.

1716
01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:25.070
We'll get,
we'll get one 40 for sure.
Hey Roger,
that her size too.
Yeah.
Okay.

1717
01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.500
We'll rock origin all day.

1718
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:30.620
He's in the world straight up factually made in America.

1719
01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:35.270
I know you're from Canada,
but made in America actually means a lot.
Yeah.
Hey Bro,

1720
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:40.040
North America where you could,
you can say made in North America,

1721
01:44:40.041 --> 01:44:42.690
which is also true.
I America means quality to me.

1722
01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:44.720
It does except for eighties cars.

1723
01:44:45.250 --> 01:44:48.440
These cars even then you put them back together yourself and it's just a piece

1724
01:44:48.441 --> 01:44:49.910
of pride that you can have in the driveway.

1725
01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:54.620
Your good deed and these keys are no exception by the way.
Um,
so yeah,

1726
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:57.260
you got to origin main.com.
That's where you can get them.

1727
01:44:57.261 --> 01:45:00.560
They've got a lot of other stuff do you do to and just regular stuff,

1728
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:04.730
regular life stuff.
Life stuff like jeans.
That's what I got to get you.

1729
01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:07.730
I've got to get some orange and jeans.
I'm a big fan of gene's a fit right.

1730
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:11.510
They're legit.
And you get your supplements there,

1731
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:15.380
which will keep you in the game on the path.
Hundred percent

1732
01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:21.110
a hundred percent a hundred percent yet that's an,

1733
01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:22.910
I don't really use a hundred print.
Well I do,

1734
01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:26.170
but do you want to say 99 just in case?
No,
no.

1735
01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:32.680
Normally I would say 97 you of the 1% wiggle room.
I get it.
And not,

1736
01:45:32.690 --> 01:45:34.010
not in this case actually,

1737
01:45:34.011 --> 01:45:36.680
they've proven to be the most important supplements I've ever taken.

1738
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:38.180
Better than Jockos.

1739
01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:43.640
They are Jockos Jocko Krill oil,

1740
01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:49.010
Jocko joint warfare made in origin labs.
Roger that.
And we're Jen.

1741
01:45:49.011 --> 01:45:53.210
So you know.
Yeah,
I can see.
Okay,
now I see.

1742
01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.120
But nonetheless they are straight up.
They'll keep you in the game.

1743
01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.130
See what I'm saying?
Okay,
so discipline go,

1744
01:45:58.190 --> 01:46:02.450
which is a little bit of a nootropic.
Yeah,
boom.

1745
01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.040
But Jason Gardner did his first Echelon Front gig.

1746
01:46:07.130 --> 01:46:09.440
Nice Dang right in the game,
right in the game.

1747
01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.130
And he sent me a text and he was like,

1748
01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:15.080
I took this by side.

1749
01:46:15.081 --> 01:46:19.790
I took three discipline go 42 minutes out from the commencement.

1750
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.720
He goes,
ty was for him.
And even tech.

1751
01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:27.940
It sounded like that's in the text.
He was so fired up.

1752
01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:32.510
But the funny thing is he texted me earlier and he says,
Hey,

1753
01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.580
it's seven o'clock in the morning.
And I was at another gig and he says,

1754
01:46:37.730 --> 01:46:41.840
Hey,
can you hook me up with some discipline?
Go and I said,

1755
01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:46.380
I'm not at my house.
My wife can get you the supply on stamps.

1756
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:50.280
So this is sorta like the supply thing is like,
hey Yo,
you deliver

1757
01:46:50.290 --> 01:46:53.610
<v 0>brie deliver.
Oh he went to my house,
picked up a couple,</v>

1758
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:58.410
picked up enough discipline for his gig discipline,
go and then he hit it.

1759
01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:03.150
So yeah,
if you feel like you might need a little something,

1760
01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:06.540
something to clarify your thoughts.

1761
01:47:07.150 --> 01:47:11.610
True to ignite a little bit of extra brainpower.

1762
01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:15.480
Yes.
Get yourself some discipline goal.
You can just get the regular discipline.

1763
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:19.950
Powdered drink.
Yeah.
The thing is if you're going to be doing something where,

1764
01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:22.080
let's just,
let me just call it what it is.

1765
01:47:22.081 --> 01:47:24.570
If you're going to have to go to the bathroom and you don't want to,

1766
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:27.300
like if you're going to go on stage and talk to people for two hours and then in

1767
01:47:27.301 --> 01:47:29.910
the middle of you get to go hard.
I even hold on a second with boost by the way.

1768
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:34.170
I've never done and hopefully I never will do.
Yeah.
So that's that.

1769
01:47:34.610 --> 01:47:38.160
You don't know anyone even done that?
I don't know.

1770
01:47:38.161 --> 01:47:43.080
I mean if you ever just had to like go to the bathroom so bad when the middle of

1771
01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:47.010
a presentation.
Yeah,
but you don't,
no you don't.
No,
you don't let it.
Wait,
wait,

1772
01:47:47.011 --> 01:47:48.930
let me,
let me put it to you.
Let me read it.
Okay.

1773
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:53.780
I used to before going into field hydrate like crazy.
Uh,
and,

1774
01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:57.490
and then so you hydrate like crazy and then you get on a helicopter and you got

1775
01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:01.260
to Piss and then you got like a 48 minute and as soon you're getting on the

1776
01:48:01.261 --> 01:48:03.030
helicopter,
you're like,
okay,
I just need it.

1777
01:48:03.031 --> 01:48:05.280
Should go right now and you don't cause someone's like,
hey,

1778
01:48:05.281 --> 01:48:06.480
come on will and get in here.

1779
01:48:06.690 --> 01:48:09.990
So you get in and then you're flying and you have to go to the bathroom so bad

1780
01:48:09.991 --> 01:48:14.610
the whole time,
the whole time and like hurt.
I've run off the Herc and job hard,

1781
01:48:14.611 --> 01:48:18.990
right and just passed it out because the whole flight you just,
you just made.

1782
01:48:18.991 --> 01:48:23.550
There are sometimes where that is really a problem.
So discipline,

1783
01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:24.660
go get help you out with that.

1784
01:48:25.150 --> 01:48:29.940
You Millennia also milk with some additional protein back in the gym or if

1785
01:48:29.941 --> 01:48:32.310
you're already in the gym,
whatever.
Mold,
boom.
Two.

1786
01:48:32.311 --> 01:48:35.160
Another two pronged effect with the milk as well.

1787
01:48:36.210 --> 01:48:40.710
Additional protein and dessert,
the dessert tasting delicious.

1788
01:48:41.190 --> 01:48:43.200
Don't forget what their warrior kid milk,

1789
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:47.250
which kids everywhere are basically if you want your kid

1790
01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:54.230
to be just a complete destroyer on the maths in school,

1791
01:48:56.580 --> 01:49:00.840
in everything that they do,
get them warrior,
get mold and there'll be happy.

1792
01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:04.950
I went off and I had to tell a who was it?

1793
01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:07.860
Tyler,
you know Tyler,

1794
01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:12.480
the kid from origin and he's doing like the the Jocko in New York City.

1795
01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:17.220
Little video and I said I was going crazy.
You kind of like I just did.

1796
01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:22.820
And I was saying that if you don't give your kids or your kid milk,

1797
01:49:23.670 --> 01:49:25.050
that's child abuse.

1798
01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:30.030
And now I'm being real.

1799
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:34.200
If you have a kid and you give your kid strawberry quick,

1800
01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:39.410
which is literally filled with sugar and crap or you could give them a

1801
01:49:39.691 --> 01:49:43.560
strawberry mold,
which tastes just as good,
if not better,

1802
01:49:43.561 --> 01:49:48.020
and it's 100% good for the kid.
How has that child abuse it

1803
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:52.330
<v 3>is not going to think about your choices.
We're going to call the uh,
the,
uh,</v>

1804
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:56.470
child protective services when we're watching,
we're seeing quick getting bought.

1805
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.960
You're going down,
you're going to get in trouble.

1806
01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:03.340
So chocolate might have some disabled that chocolate and strawberry.
Yeah,

1807
01:50:03.341 --> 01:50:04.810
of course they do.
They're there.

1808
01:50:04.811 --> 01:50:08.560
They're going to pay someone and put more money into some politicians pocket to

1809
01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:12.160
come after me cause we're trying to make kids stronger,
bringing on world,

1810
01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:16.300
bring it on.
So that's that.

1811
01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:20.260
Jackie is also,
Jack was door,
it's called Jocko store.

1812
01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:24.630
And this is where we get our apparel,
right.

1813
01:50:24.650 --> 01:50:27.230
If you want to represent while you're on the path.
It's a good one.

1814
01:50:27.231 --> 01:50:30.940
Got some new stuff on there.
Lightweight hoodies.
What do you,
what do you say?

1815
01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:35.340
What did you see?
The UC Brady's vote and Brady's just sending,

1816
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:39.010
Brady didn't even say heavyweight hoodies.
He said standard hoodies,

1817
01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:40.540
which I don't even want to stay in her.
Tony.

1818
01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:43.230
I want to heavyweight and I want to Canadian level hood.

1819
01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.020
You know what I'm saying?
Not only like standard kind of kind of.

1820
01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:51.940
It's too easy to be average.
Well,
Okay Brady,
I respect it.

1821
01:50:51.970 --> 01:50:54.580
I respect his opinion.
That wasn't just his opinion.

1822
01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.960
That was the opinion of a vote.

1823
01:50:56.010 --> 01:51:00.030
We'll that's winter vote all like or one of those poles a,
I get it.

1824
01:51:00.031 --> 01:51:04.180
And it was 60 40 in favor of standard.
If he woulda had a heavyweight on there,

1825
01:51:04.181 --> 01:51:06.460
it could have been a whole scenario because it opening on wellbeing.

1826
01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:09.400
Well good news is we already have the standard hoodies.
Okay.

1827
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:12.940
And that's a good thing.
We have lightweight hoodies,
duty mimic.
What about you?

1828
01:51:12.941 --> 01:51:14.920
Lightweight hoodies,
Yay or nay?
Just in general.

1829
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:19.280
Don't it says light weight though.
She doesn't even like that.
I just,

1830
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:20.350
I want a Hoodie.

1831
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:24.460
Why are you getting a Hoodie or not?

1832
01:51:24.461 --> 01:51:29.110
Because because people in the world exist with different,
uh,
how should I say?

1833
01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.820
Thresholds.
Different thresholds.

1834
01:51:30.821 --> 01:51:35.640
Different takes on the Hoodie situation rather than you and apparently genetic.

1835
01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:40.660
No,
Iraq.
A thin like a thin material hoodie.
Oh,
okay.

1836
01:51:40.661 --> 01:51:42.730
That's underneath my vest.

1837
01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:48.580
You're over with echo then?
Yeah.
No,
but I have another five thicker.
That's cool.

1838
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:50.930
But he just said you're with me and you just said no,
no.

1839
01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:54.130
So you know what I'm saying?
I'm with myself here.
This is,
I got,

1840
01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:58.540
I have several layers of hood.
Okay,
good.
What I'm saying,

1841
01:51:58.541 --> 01:52:03.190
I have very thick for cold,
extreme weather and then I have very thin for,

1842
01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:06.130
you know,
like California.
Yeah.
See Jody is with me,

1843
01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.240
but I didn't never call it light weight.

1844
01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:13.720
You know what I think I just called him a Hoodie.
It's like the shirt material,

1845
01:52:13.721 --> 01:52:18.280
maybe slightly fic lightweight is a classification for warmth.

1846
01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:20.260
Okay.
So maybe call it a temperate,

1847
01:52:20.590 --> 01:52:24.260
temporary chapter working title,
you know,

1848
01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:29.140
but they are a very arid weather.
Yes,
for sure.

1849
01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:34.200
Used to say this thing when I'm like in the Piper incoming,

1850
01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:40.060
incoming,
so lightweight,
temperate hoodies,
whichever incoming two little,
anyway,

1851
01:52:40.061 --> 01:52:42.850
some other new stuff on there.
Anyway,
it's on Jocko store.com.

1852
01:52:42.851 --> 01:52:46.850
Also you can get more rash guards if you really want to represent.

1853
01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:49.070
So just to help out,
uh,
like a layman,

1854
01:52:49.150 --> 01:52:53.180
the grass guard is to avoid getting like dragged across the mats and other

1855
01:52:53.181 --> 01:52:55.840
people's skin.
Right.
And getting your skin's part of it.

1856
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:59.600
But part of it is also you're just wearing it because if you and I are grappling

1857
01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:04.550
at my fingers and toes and hands and get caught and you're close and it's a

1858
01:53:04.551 --> 01:53:07.930
little bit of a pain,
Roger that,
okay.
It's better with the sweat situated.

1859
01:53:07.931 --> 01:53:09.990
Like if you're wearing this shirt,
which is cool by the way.
Oh,

1860
01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:14.770
if you're wearing that shirt and you sweat all in it,
you did 10 rounds,
you know,

1861
01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:18.530
and you're sweating all,
it's,
that's like splashing everywhere.
You know,

1862
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:23.690
everything.
The rascal cotton can become a very abrasive,

1863
01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:24.760
uh,
when it's wet.

1864
01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:28.200
And as we knew new uniforms or some people wear it underneath the geese.

1865
01:53:28.201 --> 01:53:29.780
Some people be so you know,

1866
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:33.950
if you're training geek twice a day for weeks on rash guards are a must for

1867
01:53:33.951 --> 01:53:38.630
training.
Jujitsu,
I will be,
once I get to know what I'm doing,
they're not a must,

1868
01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:41.990
but there are a nice task.
They're cool.
Yeah,
very good.

1869
01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:45.440
I prefer big time unless we have them.

1870
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:48.320
We have some represent the path,

1871
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:52.250
big time in your Jujitsu or whatever else you're doing,
cycling,
running,
whatever.

1872
01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:53.870
Some women's stuff on that.
Some hats on.

1873
01:53:53.871 --> 01:53:58.390
They're both flex fit n trucker hats.
Jody Flexner,

1874
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:59.263
trucker hat.

1875
01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:03.960
I'm a big fan of the trucker hat because it gives me the revelation.

1876
01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:08.010
He liked that echo.
Yeah,
I liked that and we offer that by the way,

1877
01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.600
so winter we have winter in Canada,

1878
01:54:11.601 --> 01:54:13.790
so flex fit keeps the heat in the truck.

1879
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:16.640
A cat because it's very humid in Ontario.
Well,

1880
01:54:16.641 --> 01:54:19.610
we have been these two this speaking of winter.
Oh,
okay.
There you go.

1881
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:23.990
So a buckle it,
it took two,
we call it in Tuk in Canada.

1882
01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:26.590
He's the one with the,
well,
yeah.

1883
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:31.070
Are just anything that goes on your head that looks like a knitted cap as it's

1884
01:54:31.071 --> 01:54:35.990
called in the army field manual to,
yeah,
we have that and you can check,

1885
01:54:35.991 --> 01:54:38.270
do gay.
I'm impartial.
I don't wear nothing.

1886
01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:42.710
I don't wear hats anymore as much so you don't have to have a beautiful

1887
01:54:43.130 --> 01:54:46.610
perfectly round head.
I guess I'm,
I'm always hiding my hair,

1888
01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:48.310
my hair.

1889
01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:52.700
When I had an easy money and I get it gets curly and then it gets like really

1890
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:55.880
hard to manage.
Very,
very home manager.
I save it.

1891
01:54:55.881 --> 01:54:57.980
There's a picture up on my Instagram if you know,

1892
01:54:57.981 --> 01:55:02.981
if you followed Jodi on Instagram of me at 16 look in all kinds of rough neck

1893
01:55:05.871 --> 01:55:06.704
with my hair.

1894
01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:11.660
This I'm about this thick and my hair is just a goddamn disaster and it's

1895
01:55:11.661 --> 01:55:15.320
beautiful.
It's beautiful to see Jodie Medicare.

1896
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:17.330
My favorite actor was Mel Gibson at the time.

1897
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:20.380
I'm just going to say that I respect that big time.
It's done.

1898
01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.750
The less good stuff on there.
If you'd Jocko,
store.com that's where you get it.

1899
01:55:23.751 --> 01:55:27.980
If you like something,
get something.
Also Jocko white tea.

1900
01:55:28.650 --> 01:55:29.450
Jocko.
I,

1901
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:33.140
I've yet to try Jocko white tea is really to set because I got some right here

1902
01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:36.810
and I've been trying it all day.
Yeah.
Oh job.
Yes.

1903
01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:40.580
After the show,
one of the many benefits,
if you don't know already,

1904
01:55:40.581 --> 01:55:44.160
which I know you already do,
you can that dead lift 8,000 pounds.

1905
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:47.130
<v 0>There was a guy,
he just dead lifted a bunch of weight recently.
Right.</v>

1906
01:55:47.131 --> 01:55:49.240
In the rogue situation.
Yeah.

1907
01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:53.280
A lot of people are worried if they're competing in power lifting.
Right,
right,

1908
01:55:53.650 --> 01:55:58.620
right.
And Yeah.
Will you get tested for Jocko white tea and they,

1909
01:55:58.630 --> 01:56:01.420
they're already automatically going to know you're taking jog 20 if he did it.

1910
01:56:01.490 --> 01:56:05.460
Yeah.
That's kind of the task.
So you gotta be careful,

1911
01:56:05.461 --> 01:56:10.461
keep it at seven 7,500 in the tournament and a little bit in the cup in the

1912
01:56:10.710 --> 01:56:12.870
competition.
But other benefits,

1913
01:56:12.871 --> 01:56:17.850
our certified u s d a organic thinking about that,

1914
01:56:17.851 --> 01:56:22.851
you could drink a normal energy drink and become less healthy or you could drink

1915
01:56:25.081 --> 01:56:28.790
Jocko white tea and you can become more healthy.
That's,

1916
01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.350
is that a hard choice to make?
I don't think so.
No,

1917
01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:33.900
it's not even a hard choice to make drink.
What's going to make you more healthy.

1918
01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:37.980
Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't subscribed to the podcast yet.

1919
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:42.000
First of all,
you have issues because there's been,

1920
01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:47.240
this is 169 and I used to think that everyone had subscribed at this point,

1921
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:50.460
but it was actually Echo Charles the proved me wrong because somebody tweeted

1922
01:56:50.461 --> 01:56:53.610
like,
no,
I just subscribed for the first time,
so if you haven't subscribed,

1923
01:56:53.611 --> 01:56:57.480
subscribe through iTunes,
Google play,
stitcher,
whatever.
Leave some reviews.

1924
01:56:57.481 --> 01:56:58.410
I was reading reviews.

1925
01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:02.370
I always re review the reviews is what I do is that people,
it's healthy.

1926
01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:05.930
It's healthy to review your reviews.
All right,

1927
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:10.440
and then don't forget about the warrior kid podcast as well.
Yeah,

1928
01:57:10.441 --> 01:57:15.210
let's not the best kids podcasts that has ever been.

1929
01:57:16.170 --> 01:57:17.190
Does anyone disagree with that?

1930
01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:21.540
I don't even know there was a kid's qualification or category or your kid

1931
01:57:21.541 --> 01:57:24.180
podcasting and family and two children and family or something and was like,

1932
01:57:24.181 --> 01:57:27.840
is the category that it's under and I'm sorry,
I did not know you had that.

1933
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:32.630
The warrior could come,
came from the world,
the warrior kid podcast,

1934
01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:37.470
which I haven't put out as many as I should,
but there's a reason for that.

1935
01:57:38.490 --> 01:57:42.960
It's like
there's a lot that goes into,
I know it might not seem like it,

1936
01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:48.120
but there's a lot that I put into those fought.
Yeah.
It was kind of my fault.

1937
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:52.620
I feel like I haven't done what all that I could have been doing to,
you know,

1938
01:57:52.621 --> 01:57:55.920
help make it happen.
I got to work harder.
That's what needs to happen.

1939
01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.980
So there's that.
And don't forget about the warrior kids soap,

1940
01:57:58.981 --> 01:58:01.950
which we have some good new samples.
You'd get the Jocko.

1941
01:58:01.951 --> 01:58:05.250
So if you can get the trooper,
the trooper soap has the rope,

1942
01:58:05.251 --> 01:58:09.810
you can hang it on soap on a rope.
Irish,
Irish oaks ranch.

1943
01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:14.100
Dr Opa.
Super useful.
Yeah,
it has a real purpose.
Know that.
Right?
Well,

1944
01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:17.250
here's the thing.
We used to make it in school.
I never knew about that.

1945
01:58:17.251 --> 01:58:21.360
And quiet here,
rope and like all this.
I'd be like,
oh,
that sounds cute.
You know?

1946
01:58:21.361 --> 01:58:23.880
And then when I say,
Oh,
soap is actually on a rope.

1947
01:58:24.370 --> 01:58:26.970
So you useful having the rules.
It's just kind of,

1948
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:30.330
you never dropped the bar soap again.
You're good to go.

1949
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:34.860
So that's Aiden.
It's a big problem.
I'm always like kid by herself.

1950
01:58:34.930 --> 01:58:37.980
So was making it and that way you can stay clean.

1951
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:41.620
Don't forget about youtube if you want to see if you want to see echoes,

1952
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:47.110
<v 3>what he considers to be his legit videos.
I never considered using that word,</v>

1953
01:58:47.111 --> 01:58:49.970
but then you can see him there because he thinks his videos are worth using.

1954
01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:53.210
I actually kind of agree with that kind of echoes.
We've got some,

1955
01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.150
he's good at the editing.
Yeah.

1956
01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:00.600
Either that or he just really does a lot of of editing and makes it so you'll

1957
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:05.260
notice it because wouldn't it be a better editor that would make it so like

1958
01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:08.740
seamless that you would just not even realize it.
You just feel it.

1959
01:59:08.741 --> 01:59:12.760
You wouldn't notice it.
Yes.
You're saying right.
Okay.
No.
Yeah,
you're right.

1960
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:16.000
When I do make those videos,
if they're good,
not the whatever.

1961
01:59:16.210 --> 01:59:19.060
When I do make them,
I make them for myself for sure.
Yeah.

1962
01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:20.920
So put it like sound effects,

1963
01:59:20.921 --> 01:59:23.710
like I shouldn't put sound effects while you're talking,

1964
01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:28.740
but I can see music because music kind of enhances or how to explosion.

1965
01:59:29.090 --> 01:59:32.500
Yeah.
What about crackling?
Like how she responds to the message.
You know what?

1966
01:59:32.501 --> 01:59:34.870
It enhances my affects that I put on.

1967
01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:37.450
It keeps you interested in what you're doing

1968
01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.790
in the video,
so yes you are correct.
Psychological warfare,

1969
01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:45.970
that's an album that you can listen to if you knew what help.

1970
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:48.370
I got a moment of weakness.
It actually,
I've been,
listen,

1971
01:59:48.371 --> 01:59:51.850
I listened to it a lot in the last three months.
I like to hear that.
Hey,

1972
01:59:52.300 --> 01:59:54.410
back to your thing.
When you were,

1973
01:59:54.411 --> 01:59:57.670
you were saying earlier where you couldn't look at the shirt.
I couldn't wear,

1974
01:59:57.820 --> 01:59:59.520
I couldn't wear it.
I can look at Brighton.
That was,

1975
01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:03.100
I mentioned this before where I mentioned the opposite though.

1976
02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:06.920
It's like when you put it on you can't skip a workout now you can't sleep.

1977
02:00:06.970 --> 02:00:08.140
It's the same concept.

1978
02:00:08.141 --> 02:00:12.220
You walk straighter kind of our purpose and the look in your eye,

1979
02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:15.790
but like I didn't wear a Jockos.
I didn't wear any of the veteran.

1980
02:00:15.791 --> 02:00:18.550
Tee shirt companies like I just,
I I anyway,
yeah,

1981
02:00:18.551 --> 02:00:20.610
when you put it on you got to like,
you got them.

1982
02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:25.030
I walked out of Rehab wearing your shirt.
I like that.
And it's just these,

1983
02:00:25.031 --> 02:00:27.460
you know,
and this is going to sound a little corny,
but it's kind of weird.

1984
02:00:27.461 --> 02:00:30.190
Just weird having one of your friends pep talk you at a bed.

1985
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:33.010
I've got to go ahead and say that like,
you know,
putting,
putting,

1986
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:34.810
putting on your logical warfare.

1987
02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:38.920
I'll psychological warfare album on repeat and it's like somebody you hang with.

1988
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:43.750
It's just kinda like,
I get it Jocko.
I'm a,
I need to work harder.
Okay.

1989
02:00:43.890 --> 02:00:48.270
You Ain't texted you yesterday.
Like I get up at six,
it's not Jocko timings,

1990
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:50.140
but it's the best I can do right now.

1991
02:00:50.170 --> 02:00:52.840
You know what's really weird is when I have to listen to psychological warfare

1992
02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:54.670
myself,
that would be the most weird.

1993
02:00:54.670 --> 02:00:57.750
I think that is the weirdest thing or the most normal cause it's kind of like

1994
02:00:57.770 --> 02:01:02.710
arts,
the most amazing thing ever.
Maybe it'd be the spouse situation.

1995
02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:05.920
That's a good idea.
If you're a person that's trying to do something,

1996
02:01:05.921 --> 02:01:10.000
be good to cut yourself a couple of tracks to explain to yourself why you're

1997
02:01:10.001 --> 02:01:13.030
trying to do this thing.
So when the moment of weakness comes,

1998
02:01:13.330 --> 02:01:16.690
you could listen to me.
Sure.
But you could actually listen to yourself.

1999
02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:19.890
Actually that's a,
that's a great idea.
We're going to do that.

2000
02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.610
Tell him that like it's,
this is my presence or this is my future self.

2001
02:01:24.611 --> 02:01:26.500
It's like I've heard of people doing that and he'll be like,
okay,

2002
02:01:26.501 --> 02:01:30.790
I know that I'm going to be slacking on whatever and I forget what exactly what

2003
02:01:30.791 --> 02:01:34.420
it's for,
but there'll be like,
they'll put an audio note and they'll say,

2004
02:01:34.421 --> 02:01:38.410
this is your,
uh,
past self or whatever saying to you,

2005
02:01:38.411 --> 02:01:41.330
future echo closely.
Yes,
exactly right.
Saying,
Hey,

2006
02:01:41.331 --> 02:01:43.280
this is what you're thinking right now.
This is what you're feeling right now.

2007
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:45.190
Don't do it.
Take it.
You know,
it's like you're talking to yourself.

2008
02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:47.680
I've heard of that.
Yeah.
Kelly,
I have a thing where we go,

2009
02:01:47.690 --> 02:01:50.620
that sounds like a problem for future Jody and Kelly,
didn't you?
Yeah,
yeah,

2010
02:01:50.630 --> 02:01:51.900
exactly the opposite.

2011
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:57.080
They're going to be like you dealt with that future Jodi Kelly,
didn't you?
Yep.

2012
02:01:57.270 --> 02:02:00.050
I like that.
I jog.
We're going to try that.
We'll let you know how it works.

2013
02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:03.080
I like it.
I'll tell you right now I,
it sounds good in theory,

2014
02:02:03.081 --> 02:02:08.081
but I'm all like disobey myself way quicker than I'll disobeying you.

2015
02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:12.630
<v 0>That's a good point.
I think a lot of people like that besides the coin.</v>

2016
02:02:13.190 --> 02:02:16.180
Cause eventually you'd be like,
I'm not listening to Jocko.
He's,
yeah,

2017
02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:21.390
he's crazy.
Right?

2018
02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:24.450
But then you fix yourself telling you that no escape.

2019
02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:27.500
If it's a goal that you set for yourself,

2020
02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:32.130
not my goal to go and you set for yourself.
That's true.
I'm my own worst critic,

2021
02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.790
so I don't know.
I think you know,
you're right.

2022
02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:36.030
Breaking your promise to yourself as well.

2023
02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:39.570
<v 3>Way Easier.
Yeah.
Cause you might be used to that or it's weird.</v>

2024
02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:43.750
<v 0>Yeah.
I think you'd use both.
Also checkout a flipside,</v>

2025
02:02:43.810 --> 02:02:48.810
canvas.com this is Dakota Meyer from podcasts for one 15

2026
02:02:51.850 --> 02:02:56.200
and he's selling basically bad ass prince.

2027
02:02:56.201 --> 02:02:58.390
Is that what you call him?
Call him prince.
Prince.

2028
02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:03.460
You can get prints of what really cool stuff,
you know,
movie scenes,

2029
02:03:03.461 --> 02:03:07.240
things.
Know,
like there's a couple of them sitting over there.
Good.
He'd get one.

2030
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:12.130
He made you can get over this list.
Yeah.
Discipline equals freedom.
So yeah,

2031
02:03:12.131 --> 02:03:16.990
if you want us to support what's the,
it's called the flip side,
canvas.com.

2032
02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:19.540
And actually the reason it's called flip side is because of one of the last

2033
02:03:19.630 --> 02:03:20.051
things,

2034
02:03:20.051 --> 02:03:23.650
one of his Bros said to them before they went to that battle was I'll see you on

2035
02:03:23.651 --> 02:03:25.690
the flip side.
That's what the story is behind that.

2036
02:03:26.230 --> 02:03:29.950
So support to go to he's the man and check it out.

2037
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:31.690
You can also get these,
uh,

2038
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:36.750
these welder kind of reminders to you that you can just hang up and get

2039
02:03:37.181 --> 02:03:38.520
reminded.
Could we,

2040
02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:41.200
cause we need to get reminded whether it's psychological warfare,

2041
02:03:41.290 --> 02:03:45.730
whether it's uh,
a print,
keep yourself on the path,
whether it's a tee shirt,

2042
02:03:45.731 --> 02:03:49.330
keep yourself on the path.
Yeah.
These things have an impact.

2043
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:54.040
<v 3>Yeah.
The,
and those reminders are actually way more like powerful,</v>

2044
02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.670
powerful,
but they're more powerful than you might think.

2045
02:03:57.671 --> 02:04:01.930
Because think about like even like with drinking or something like this where if

2046
02:04:01.931 --> 02:04:06.931
you have like a plan day tomorrow where it has no room for drinking that day and

2047
02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:07.720
no room,

2048
02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:11.080
no room for drinking the night before or that day if you'll have it all planned

2049
02:04:11.081 --> 02:04:15.460
out,
your probably you'll drink with your likelihood to drink way less.

2050
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:19.990
But if you don't it's almost like you sort of forget to stay focused on what you

2051
02:04:19.991 --> 02:04:23.560
have to do.
You know?
Almost like a way of forgetting it was freedom.

2052
02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:27.410
That's why if you have a plan day like you get more done rather than because you

2053
02:04:27.411 --> 02:04:29.820
you fall susceptible to like what do I feel like doing?

2054
02:04:30.090 --> 02:04:31.960
You know your led more with what you feel or don't.

2055
02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:36.280
The weird thing is when you're dealing with addiction that's when you screw up

2056
02:04:36.281 --> 02:04:37.114
the most.

2057
02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:41.190
The day that you have the big presentation they'd be meeting that night before

2058
02:04:41.191 --> 02:04:44.320
is when you will cause that like self sabotage yourself.

2059
02:04:44.370 --> 02:04:48.390
That's 100% self sabotage tank cause you want to get caught cause you know

2060
02:04:48.391 --> 02:04:50.010
you're doing the wrong things.
You know what,

2061
02:04:50.011 --> 02:04:53.700
a lot of what my behavior over the last two for the last two years was like.

2062
02:04:53.701 --> 02:04:58.290
I hope someone,
I think psycholog or subconscious was like,
yeah,
somebody like,

2063
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:03.180
cause it became my actions became almost arrogant.
Like in my boldness anyway.

2064
02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:04.950
We're done with all that.
Let's,
let's finish.

2065
02:05:04.951 --> 02:05:09.570
The commercials are so these are more like announcements to,

2066
02:05:09.670 --> 02:05:12.150
to stay in the past.
This is the Jocko Willink podcast.

2067
02:05:12.151 --> 02:05:15.420
He can do whatever he wants.
True.
It's true.
So Home Gym,
right?

2068
02:05:15.421 --> 02:05:16.110
We're doing home gym.

2069
02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:18.930
You go to [inaudible] dot com this is where you get your kettle bells.

2070
02:05:20.070 --> 02:05:24.010
I have all of the monkey bells that they put out five years ago.
Remember those?

2071
02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:28.290
I got them,
I got the mace,
the Quad Mace.

2072
02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:33.510
That thing as hard on it.
Yeah.
Do you have like a regular routine with the Mace?

2073
02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:37.080
I had one man actually Jack Time.

2074
02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:41.640
I actually jacked my elbows because of like all the shooting I did as a sniper.

2075
02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:45.660
So I had to build up my inner like cause of what's in the insight.

2076
02:05:45.661 --> 02:05:49.310
It's the Golfer's elbow.
Right?
This is a tennis.
Anyway,

2077
02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:53.490
I had to build up the tendons and then I could swim in the sea and that's what

2078
02:05:53.491 --> 02:05:56.050
I'm saying.
He tried to do a little routine.
If you're not used to that bro,

2079
02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:58.420
you'll feel all those little weirdo muscles that you have.

2080
02:05:58.830 --> 02:06:02.430
One of my buddies sold my house here in San Diego and he sends me a text.

2081
02:06:02.431 --> 02:06:06.540
He's out of town,
you know,
he's in the Daves and he goes,
he goes,
hey man,

2082
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:09.570
sold the house.
Escrow closes tomorrow.
It's done.

2083
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:13.290
I got a tire there and some other like bumper plates,
whatever.

2084
02:06:13.291 --> 02:06:16.050
If you want to go grab it,
I'm not,
I'm not taking it.
So if you want to get it,

2085
02:06:16.170 --> 02:06:19.980
otherwise I got to get it moved by someone.
So it was a little bit of a,
you know,

2086
02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:21.480
good deal for him.
Good deal for me.

2087
02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:24.540
It's been raining here in southern California.
Anyways,

2088
02:06:24.541 --> 02:06:28.080
I show up to the house and I was pretty psyched to get attire.
You know,

2089
02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:30.710
we're talking about a big tractor tire track or charter,

2090
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:34.770
but I was thinking like a big tractor tire that you know,
you could,
you know,

2091
02:06:34.771 --> 02:06:39.530
easily thrown a vehicle or something like that.
It was like truth,

2092
02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:43.830
your mass,
some of the big foot would be huge.

2093
02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:48.630
It's huge.
It's absolutely huge.
I barely got it.
And you know,
my giant van,

2094
02:06:49.050 --> 02:06:52.290
I barely bay,
literally barely got into the most,

2095
02:06:52.410 --> 02:06:54.160
the biggest van you could buy.

2096
02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:59.400
I barely got it after it was all filled with water.
I had to get a scoop.

2097
02:06:59.401 --> 02:07:02.730
All the one I'm wearing my flip flops.
It was a nightmare.

2098
02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:07.670
So to my buddy that,
uh,
then you know who you are.
I got your tire to my backyard.

2099
02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:09.570
I'm psych now of course,
because now I've got a cool tire.

2100
02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:12.420
I also was like one of those things that kind of,
Oh,
you know,

2101
02:07:12.421 --> 02:07:15.210
I've got to call in like 30 minutes.
I'll just drive over there,

2102
02:07:15.211 --> 02:07:19.260
grab it real quick.
No,
I was out there and get barely making it back.

2103
02:07:20.610 --> 02:07:24.750
But you made it so don't underestimate or underestimate the tire.

2104
02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:28.650
That's the deal.
Clarify the tire.
Oh,
you had a tire.

2105
02:07:29.070 --> 02:07:32.430
You need a moving truck to move it.
Oh,
give me a heads up next.

2106
02:07:32.431 --> 02:07:35.860
How you figured tractor tire tractor.
You just say the tire

2107
02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:40.720
<v 0>so that it's as tall as not as tall as me.</v>

2108
02:07:40.721 --> 02:07:44.530
It's not as tall as me,
but it's be like the one here.
No,
no.

2109
02:07:44.531 --> 02:07:49.030
That's what I was expecting a victory at at our,
our gym here.
You know victory,

2110
02:07:49.031 --> 02:07:51.370
Jim.
We know we've got an,
we've got some tires.
We've got three or four of them.

2111
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:56.350
Yeah.
This thing is bigger than all of them,
but a lot bigger.
But you know,
hey,

2112
02:07:56.351 --> 02:08:00.940
he hooked me up apparently.
Probably vague on purpose.
Yeah,

2113
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:05.110
no,
he knows I'm fired up.
Right.
Most people would think Jocko longer,
I guess.

2114
02:08:05.111 --> 02:08:08.530
Tired.
He was an estimation jump,
jump.
Go on asking.
I know he won't ask.

2115
02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:13.120
I can't wait for him to go get that tight.
Little less so.
Tires or otherwise.

2116
02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:18.130
Home Gym boomed.
Like I said,
kettle bells rings,
jump rope.

2117
02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:20.800
That's a big one to forget the jump rope.

2118
02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:23.770
Don't forget to jump a lot of cool stuff on there.
Go to work on their feet.

2119
02:08:24.170 --> 02:08:27.400
If you,
I mean if you can jump around,
have you jumped rope for,
can you jump rope?

2120
02:08:27.490 --> 02:08:32.440
No,
I've tried it.
Just a guy though on his ankles and calves.
Uh,

2121
02:08:33.130 --> 02:08:34.380
I think his name's Mad Matt

2122
02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:39.160
<v 2>on Instagram.
He's a double below knee.
I believe he's American army.
Anyway,</v>

2123
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:43.120
he jumps rope but he has like some prosthetic I haven't seen before.

2124
02:08:43.121 --> 02:08:44.680
So I'm going to try and get my hands on some of those.

2125
02:08:45.390 --> 02:08:46.870
<v 0>Jumping rope is awesome.
Yup.</v>

2126
02:08:47.010 --> 02:08:51.120
Unless you get them on it.com/shock we got some books.

2127
02:08:51.121 --> 02:08:52.740
Jody's got two books.

2128
02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:56.790
The first book which I covered on podcast 24 is called unflinching.

2129
02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:00.570
You can read,
you should,
you should definitely read it.
It's an awesome book.

2130
02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:02.910
Thanks man.
Yeah,
it shows the path,

2131
02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:05.730
the journey that Jody's been on and now you know,

2132
02:09:05.731 --> 02:09:07.950
the rest of the journey can hear the rest of the journey.

2133
02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:12.080
And he also wrote another book called Everyday Heroes,
which is,

2134
02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:13.670
<v 2>um,
I,</v>

2135
02:09:13.670 --> 02:09:18.620
cause in Canada the military books genre is not as well received,
let's say.

2136
02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:21.350
Um,
so,
uh,

2137
02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:25.040
my publisher realized there was an audience when my book hit the bestseller
list.

2138
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:28.520
Um,
in Canada though,
I mean there's less people in Canada,

2139
02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:30.050
all of Canada than there are in California.

2140
02:09:30.110 --> 02:09:33.590
So it's like my kids aren't going to Ivy League schools or anything.
Uh,

2141
02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:35.570
but so they want,

2142
02:09:35.571 --> 02:09:40.370
so I wanted to do a book that would let other soldiers tell their story and I'm

2143
02:09:40.371 --> 02:09:42.350
hoping to make a series out of it.
Like it's,
it's a,

2144
02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:46.970
it's a book that I think I could do every year and never rented a material.

2145
02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:52.220
Uh,
so we'll pick it up everyday heroes.
It's available every Amazon and anywhere.

2146
02:09:52.221 --> 02:09:56.570
But some good old boys from World War II and Korea right up to Afghanistan.

2147
02:09:56.571 --> 02:09:59.780
One of my favorite stories is this Guy Bruno.
Uh,

2148
02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:04.500
he disarms a suicide bomber while the guy has his fingers on the trigger.
Yeah.

2149
02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:07.910
The ball like balls the size of like kettlebells.
I'm like,
so anyway,

2150
02:10:07.911 --> 02:10:11.160
and he's a pretty good,
cool duties.
He's out there somewhere doing the,

2151
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:12.890
doing the good fight,
but

2152
02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:15.810
<v 0>that's awesome.
Yeah.
So pick those books up.</v>

2153
02:10:15.811 --> 02:10:19.920
You can all skip Mikey and the dragons best children's book

2154
02:10:21.450 --> 02:10:25.980
in the world.
Yeah.
Mikey,
the dragons,
biking the dragons.
You can pick that one up.

2155
02:10:25.981 --> 02:10:28.950
You can pick up the way.
The warrior kid way,
the warrior kid too,

2156
02:10:28.951 --> 02:10:33.590
which is called March mission.
Jodi,
how does your daughter like way the kid,

2157
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:38.930
uh,
in her words,
it's the greatest book she's ever read and she's 10.

2158
02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:39.680
Yeah.

2159
02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:43.730
And she's a girl and she's Canadian and she's my daughter and I can't get her to

2160
02:10:43.731 --> 02:10:46.070
do like even Jujitsu's an argument.
I'm like,

2161
02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:48.650
you're doing Jujitsu when I start and she's like,
no,
I don't want to.

2162
02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:52.460
But for some reason that book and it sat on our shelf for a couple of months.

2163
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:55.610
Yeah.
But man,
when she read it,
she said,
this is,
I didn't,

2164
02:10:55.611 --> 02:10:56.720
she didn't tell me she was reading it.

2165
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:59.330
But you said your friend wrote the greatest book I've ever read.

2166
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.170
She did a book report on it for school and everything was awesome.
Yeah.

2167
02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:05.870
I think it's one of those things you don't want to force your kid to read it.

2168
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:09.020
You just put it there.
Just kind of put it out there and let them read it.

2169
02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:10.400
Just like any leadership position,

2170
02:11:10.401 --> 02:11:12.080
you don't want to force things down someone's throat.

2171
02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:16.220
You just make available to them the path they,
when they see it,

2172
02:11:16.221 --> 02:11:20.780
they get on it and there's going to be new or your kid book coming out in the

2173
02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:24.230
spring.
I'll let you know when it's available for preorder.

2174
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:29.090
The big preorder,
the name of that.
There's some title.

2175
02:11:29.091 --> 02:11:31.570
That book is where there's a will.
So you've got that one coming.

2176
02:11:31.571 --> 02:11:35.180
You've got the discipline equals freedom field manual if you need to.

2177
02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:37.130
It's another little reminder for life.

2178
02:11:37.130 --> 02:11:39.440
It's another thing that'll keep you on the path of,
keeps me on the path.

2179
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:42.380
Just have that book sitting on one of my friends that uh,

2180
02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.210
is that a hedge fund and in there,
in there,
you know,

2181
02:11:47.211 --> 02:11:51.890
it's like a really cool looking,
you know,
hedge funds in New York City.
All cool.

2182
02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.880
All Wolf of Wall Street type stuff.
What's the,
yeah,
sleek.

2183
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:56.691
That's the modern thing.

2184
02:11:56.691 --> 02:12:01.010
They're very sleek and he shows me a picture of like they're there when you walk

2185
02:12:01.011 --> 02:12:02.840
in and you know when you walk into a hedge fund you want to,

2186
02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:05.750
they want to leave an impression that they know what's up.

2187
02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:09.590
There's this big white table,
what's on the white table,

2188
02:12:11.090 --> 02:12:15.890
the field men feel better.
One book just sitting there and he says,

2189
02:12:15.891 --> 02:12:18.620
everyone that comes in and picks it up and goes,
what is this thing?

2190
02:12:18.621 --> 02:12:19.250
This is awesome.

2191
02:12:19.250 --> 02:12:23.210
So it's perfect to be the only book to aesthetically what I'm saying,

2192
02:12:23.211 --> 02:12:26.240
especially if the white table or black goes with everything or a great table.

2193
02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:28.670
Yeah,
I get it.
It goes with everything.
It's very nice.

2194
02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:30.950
So get that book for yourself,

2195
02:12:30.951 --> 02:12:35.951
for anyone that wants to get after it more or continually extreme ownership.

2196
02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:38.660
We talked about that a bit today,

2197
02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:44.270
the lessons we learned in combat and how you can apply them to your business,

2198
02:12:44.330 --> 02:12:48.590
to your team,
to your family,
to your life.
Also the dichotomy of leadership,

2199
02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:53.510
which is now starting to creep out from its older brother's shadow cause extreme

2200
02:12:53.511 --> 02:12:57.760
ownership.
Everyone knows it.
Everyone loves it,
but they're like,
oh,
dichotomy out.

2201
02:12:57.761 --> 02:12:58.910
We don't know about your little brother.

2202
02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.440
It's kind of like you echo Jade's little brother,
right?
Yep,
sure.
Yep.

2203
02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:07.060
And you know,
it was Kinda like,
oh,
jade was kind of the guy,
right?
No,

2204
02:13:07.110 --> 02:13:11.290
came first came here is just the echo.
Right.

2205
02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:17.920
And jade was,
jade jade was bigger than you,
right?
Yeah,
he was.
Who's bigger now?

2206
02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:18.980
You see what I'm saying?

2207
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:24.140
So dichotomy of leadership is like the Echo Charles of the j Charles Oh,

2208
02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:27.910
family
on that thread.
Like,
uh,

2209
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:32.190
before my Jody medic podcast episode,
when we were coming

2210
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:36.410
<v 3>to meet you when he was coming,
we debated Luca and I debated if echo like eyes,</v>

2211
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:40.200
I say,
I can't wait to find out what Echo Charles,
his real name is.

2212
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:44.850
And Luke says,
I hope it's Echo Charles,
because I just thought it was,

2213
02:13:44.851 --> 02:13:47.910
remember we talked about this Alpha Bravo.
Charlie,
right?

2214
02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.650
And then when I asked you and you're like,
no,
my name,
my name's Echo.
And why?

2215
02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:55.770
What's Charles mean?
And you're like,
it's,
my last name is Leslie.
I just,
I just,

2216
02:13:55.771 --> 02:13:58.740
just really listening to the shows by shows the other day and I was like,

2217
02:13:58.770 --> 02:13:59.620
I was like,
oh yeah,

2218
02:13:59.630 --> 02:14:03.000
can we meet to talk to echo about like how I thought for sure your real name was

2219
02:14:03.001 --> 02:14:07.530
like was like,
like Ernie or something.
He called you echo cause it's cooler.

2220
02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:11.550
It starts with an e.
We didn't want no Ernie on the podcast here.

2221
02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:15.060
Kind of like how you did with Tuskegee to bruise or you did that exact thing and

2222
02:14:15.061 --> 02:14:19.240
maybe if your name was like Ernie,
I wouldn't have to change it.

2223
02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:22.620
It's echo.
Echo just sounds cooler.
And then Charles was like,

2224
02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:26.260
because like maybe your real name was Charlie or something.
I don't know.
Yeah,

2225
02:14:26.370 --> 02:14:30.390
I dig it well with these books.
Good news by the way.
Books,
speaking of books,

2226
02:14:30.750 --> 02:14:34.830
all these you can can,
you can get everyday heroes.
All these books on Jocko,

2227
02:14:34.831 --> 02:14:38.580
podcast.com I got them organized.
Here's a list of books,

2228
02:14:38.610 --> 02:14:42.360
all of them and you can get the dichotomy of leadership there as well and

2229
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:44.880
extremely all these books.
Yeah,
I got them listed on a page.

2230
02:14:44.881 --> 02:14:48.480
Every book we've covered podcast you ever got,
ever did here was on there.

2231
02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:49.560
You do now?
No,

2232
02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:53.730
I think I did for that original orders on your website.

2233
02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:58.500
I think for then originally wasn't.
Yeah.
Unflinching is for sure.

2234
02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:00.000
It is.
Oh thanks man.

2235
02:15:00.150 --> 02:15:03.240
I didn't realize that every book that we've done is on is on.

2236
02:15:03.630 --> 02:15:07.710
Thanks Jocko podcast episode.
That's probably why it's still selling.

2237
02:15:08.610 --> 02:15:10.710
It's still selling.
It's still selling.
That's what I mean.

2238
02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:14.190
It's a weird thing you got to remember is that the lag time on the podcast is

2239
02:15:14.250 --> 02:15:17.580
there's some,
there's,
there's,
there's many,

2240
02:15:17.581 --> 02:15:21.860
many people that start with episode one today.
No Bro.
That's what I said.

2241
02:15:21.870 --> 02:15:25.290
And I say,
I get a message like weekly,
minimum one a week.
It's,

2242
02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:29.850
I just heard you on Jocko and,
and I go like,
I resist the urge to say,

2243
02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:31.980
Oh,
if you heard me on episode,

2244
02:15:31.981 --> 02:15:36.981
was it 24 25 to 24 25 wait till one 11 or,

2245
02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:41.510
and then,
you know,
because I want them to discover it on their own.
Yeah,
no,

2246
02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:44.460
that's one of the coolest things is people and people ask me,

2247
02:15:44.461 --> 02:15:46.530
where should I start on the podcast?
And I say one,

2248
02:15:47.010 --> 02:15:51.960
and they definitely build on each other,
but they're also timeless.

2249
02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:52.980
So it's not like you go,

2250
02:15:53.010 --> 02:15:57.240
oh well they're talking about some political thing that happened in 2014 and I

2251
02:15:57.241 --> 02:15:58.950
don't want to listen to that right now.
No,

2252
02:15:58.951 --> 02:16:02.460
it's like we're talking about something that happened 480 years ago and you do

2253
02:16:02.461 --> 02:16:06.960
want to hear about it.
So yeah.
But I saw the dichotomy of leadership.

2254
02:16:06.961 --> 02:16:09.120
Someone the other day had had wrote on Twitter.

2255
02:16:09.121 --> 02:16:11.310
This is the best leadership book I've ever read,

2256
02:16:11.490 --> 02:16:14.310
which is normally what I hear about extreme ownership.

2257
02:16:14.311 --> 02:16:17.160
So now I see a little little replacement there.

2258
02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:21.270
Jade Charles is being usurped by his younger brother.

2259
02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.850
That's what's going on.
So jade,

2260
02:16:23.851 --> 02:16:26.850
better stirpes to keep rooting for extreme ownership year.

2261
02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:28.830
You represent the dichotomy of leadership.

2262
02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:32.500
<v 0>We got national in front of leadership consultancy.</v>

2263
02:16:32.770 --> 02:16:37.090
What we do is we solve problems through leadership.
It's me,
Leif Babin,

2264
02:16:37.090 --> 02:16:41.320
JP Denelle Day,
Burke,
Flint Cochran,
Mike Cirelli,
Mike [inaudible],

2265
02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:43.900
and Jason Gardner.

2266
02:16:44.410 --> 02:16:48.450
Someone put up like Da Nang.
Everyone at this company,

2267
02:16:48.451 --> 02:16:52.010
he's a pipe head or no one can compete.
I was like,
hmm.
Pay.

2268
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:53.110
I'm not going to say don't compete,

2269
02:16:53.111 --> 02:16:56.080
but we definitely have awesome guys on the team.

2270
02:16:56.710 --> 02:16:59.530
That's echelon front.com for details there.

2271
02:16:59.531 --> 02:17:03.220
We got to muster coming in 2019 May 23rd and 24th in Chicago,

2272
02:17:03.490 --> 02:17:08.440
September 19th and 20th in Denver.
December 4th and fifth in Sydney,
Australia.

2273
02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:09.873
That's right.

2274
02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:15.750
Go to extreme ownership.com every one of these events are sold out and all of

2275
02:17:17.081 --> 02:17:18.340
these are going to sell out.

2276
02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:21.070
They're actually selling faster than they ever sold before.

2277
02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:25.190
When we look at our data analytics,
the meda data,

2278
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.810
they eat it that no one say it's,

2279
02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.860
we made it data.
How do you guys call it?

2280
02:17:33.970 --> 02:17:38.640
We'll work on the Canadian one after this.
Yeah,
the Canadian dates.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2281
02:17:38.660 --> 02:17:39.493
If online,

2282
02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:42.880
one of the reasons that we did this is because not everyone can come to the

2283
02:17:42.881 --> 02:17:45.910
muster.
And every time I post about the muster,
there's someone that says,

2284
02:17:45.911 --> 02:17:48.520
when you come to Milwaukee,
when you come into Detroit,

2285
02:17:48.521 --> 02:17:50.030
when he had come up to Ottawa,

2286
02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:54.160
and the bottom line is we can't go everywhere to do monsters.

2287
02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:57.280
That was one of the things that made us make this thing f on line.

2288
02:17:57.281 --> 02:18:01.930
The other reason is we work with companies that have tens or hundreds of

2289
02:18:01.930 --> 02:18:05.290
thousands of employees and they say,
oh,

2290
02:18:05.291 --> 02:18:07.870
can you just train all of their employees?
And I say,
well,
yeah,
sure.

2291
02:18:07.871 --> 02:18:11.200
And then they say,
I have 138,000 boys took,
hm,
no,

2292
02:18:11.201 --> 02:18:12.160
actually that's gonna be a problem.

2293
02:18:12.161 --> 02:18:14.860
So how to solve that problem we made eff online.

2294
02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:20.160
It is interactive training online that you can take you online.com we have also

2295
02:18:23.460 --> 02:18:25.270
eff Overwatch if you want.

2296
02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:30.300
If you want a combat proven special operations leader or combat aviation leader

2297
02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:37.660
to come and work inside your company to make things happen,

2298
02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:42.460
then go to [inaudible],
overwatch.com fill out the information.

2299
02:18:42.461 --> 02:18:47.461
Whether you're a vet that wants a position or your a talent seeker that needs

2300
02:18:47.531 --> 02:18:50.950
people at your company that can lead and understand the principles that we talk

2301
02:18:50.951 --> 02:18:54.100
about,
an extreme ownership.
Then check that out.

2302
02:18:54.550 --> 02:18:56.950
And if you want to keep cruising with us,

2305
02:19:07.490 --> 02:19:11.740
off or you off these book.
Now he's on Facebook.
Echo is adequate.
Charles.

2306
02:19:11.741 --> 02:19:16.741
I am at Jocko Willink and Jodi is at Jody Mitic Echo.

2307
02:19:16.901 --> 02:19:21.160
Anything else?
I have nothing else.
Thank you.
Thank you for having nothing else.

2308
02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:28.040
Jody,
anything else

2309
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:32.240
<v 2>brother?
Thank you Jackie.
Thank you,
Echo.
Thank you to the listeners and um,</v>

2310
02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:33.680
you know,
I,

2311
02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:37.700
I'm working on being the best Jody I can be then thanks for being there with,

2312
02:19:37.701 --> 02:19:41.450
for me and uh,
with Kelly and I,
it's good that you have like a new mission.

2313
02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:44.570
Remember that was one of the best ways I've ever heard it.

2314
02:19:44.630 --> 02:19:48.170
Heard it put like you need a mission.
So man,

2315
02:19:48.171 --> 02:19:51.830
if you don't have like an important mission,
like really cared.
I mean,
sure I got,

2316
02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:54.110
I know what I got to do tomorrow in the next month and all that stuff.

2317
02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:56.800
But if it's not like that important to you,
right,

2318
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:58.850
you're going to be like all I need.
That's what happened Bro.

2319
02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:04.160
The politics getting in DePaul it winning,
what's a great mission.

2320
02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:09.680
And then I won and then I was like the dog that caught the car.
Yay.
I was like,

2321
02:20:09.681 --> 02:20:13.190
okay,
what do I do now?
And I tried to learn and I,
I,
you know,

2322
02:20:13.191 --> 02:20:16.640
I had the deputy mayor and the mayor and they were all on my side and I had lots

2323
02:20:16.641 --> 02:20:19.700
of like they all,
we still talk,
but my,
my,

2324
02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:22.760
they could say that cause he could see it.
My heart just wasn't in it.
You know,

2325
02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:26.030
like Kelly would always say,
she would always say,
man,
you know,

2326
02:20:26.031 --> 02:20:26.900
when you get excited,

2327
02:20:26.901 --> 02:20:29.720
when you talk about like going here to see the troops are going there and

2328
02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:32.340
shooting and going there and like planning and up that business.
You've,

2329
02:20:32.341 --> 02:20:35.980
oh I wanted to open a gym since before I got blown up,
you know,

2330
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:38.360
and now I'm back on it.
And I thought I could do both.

2331
02:20:38.361 --> 02:20:41.590
I thought being the counselor would let me like,
you know,

2332
02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:45.820
have a spot open it,
like be there for meetings is,
but it's just like,

2333
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:48.620
it's just not,
doesn't work.
Not For me anyway.
Maybe if I go,

2334
02:20:48.730 --> 02:20:53.730
like I might get political again in my fifties after I make a few bucks and it's

2335
02:20:54.111 --> 02:20:56.090
a little less more to pay the bills.

2336
02:20:56.091 --> 02:20:59.420
And so it's a little less about paying the bills and more about getting things

2337
02:20:59.421 --> 02:21:02.750
done.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so we didn't know,

2338
02:21:02.751 --> 02:21:05.120
but right now I need to be myself for a while.

2339
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:09.590
And so that's it for like 10 year plan is to be Jody.
Boom,
chuck him,

2340
02:21:09.591 --> 02:21:11.120
as Echo said,
that's a new mission.

2341
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:13.850
The new mission with the place that you're developing and you know,

2342
02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:16.220
to unplugging for as long as they did.

2343
02:21:16.221 --> 02:21:18.110
I didn't realize how much you're doing and burrow,

2344
02:21:18.111 --> 02:21:21.950
like the respect I have for you actually just went up hearing up and it's not

2345
02:21:21.951 --> 02:21:26.270
like I,
it's not like it can go much higher,
don't get too egotistical.

2346
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:29.190
But you know,
a guy like me thinking you're awesome but mia,

2347
02:21:29.230 --> 02:21:32.300
my point is everything you're doing is for the community.

2348
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:35.510
And I had a sit down actually shot show 2017.

2349
02:21:35.511 --> 02:21:38.340
One of the guys I taught on his basic sniper sat,
he's an,

2350
02:21:38.350 --> 02:21:43.160
he's one of the best snipers in Canada.
Uh,
one of our soft commanders.
He said,

2351
02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:44.660
uh,
you need to stop.

2352
02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:48.170
[inaudible] was another guy who told me you can do more for the community as

2353
02:21:48.171 --> 02:21:52.820
Jody medic and working for yourself than for working for Colt or de Macko were

2354
02:21:52.821 --> 02:21:56.210
any of these other companies that I was looking at and you know,
and,

2355
02:21:56.220 --> 02:21:58.370
and it's being able to take,

2356
02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:04.420
take the reigns of leadership that you have and start doing the things listening

2357
02:22:05.391 --> 02:22:07.220
to you talk.
I'm like,
because Kelly and I,
like,

2358
02:22:07.221 --> 02:22:11.000
we have a five and 10 year plan where we hope we can have an employment website

2359
02:22:11.001 --> 02:22:14.120
where we hope we can have a speaking bureau that can take guys,

2360
02:22:14.121 --> 02:22:17.570
have a similar mindset and have us have a presence and put them out there

2361
02:22:17.571 --> 02:22:20.930
delivering a good message.
And,
and you're doing all that and you're being a,

2362
02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:25.030
an example for my kids,
dude.
And like,
cause then,
you know,

2363
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:27.120
takes a village to raise a kid.
And I,

2364
02:22:27.121 --> 02:22:30.930
and I want my daughters to know all the best people in the world.
And you know,

2365
02:22:30.931 --> 02:22:34.500
you're one of them in and you're just everything you're doing with the people

2366
02:22:34.501 --> 02:22:36.930
around you.
Like,
um,
um,
um,
I have,

2367
02:22:37.410 --> 02:22:42.060
I have someone that's leading the way for me,
uh,
and I,

2368
02:22:42.061 --> 02:22:46.460
and I'm glad it's not just me doing it either,
is that,
makes it like I'm waving,

2369
02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:50.850
I'm 10 years behind you,
but,
but now I know it's a,
it's possible too.
Yeah,
no,

2370
02:22:50.851 --> 02:22:53.010
it's,
um,
there's,
there's plenty of room,

2371
02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:57.840
there's all kinds of people in the world that are down to move forward and move

2372
02:22:57.841 --> 02:23:00.240
on.
And,
yeah,
and there's plenty of pie for everybody.

2373
02:23:00.241 --> 02:23:02.160
That's the word right now in Canada.

2374
02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:05.550
We're dealing with a little bit of like a too much competition,

2375
02:23:05.551 --> 02:23:10.230
not enough collaboration.
And as far as the tactical after army world,
um,

2376
02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:13.350
but you know,
and the reason I kept throwing an Ottawa,
Canada,

2377
02:23:13.351 --> 02:23:16.980
there's cause they're hungry for Jocko in Canada and,

2378
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:19.770
and you and we should talk because we have a little barrier.

2379
02:23:19.771 --> 02:23:22.650
We have a little bit,
but I'm telling you,
it's probably bigger than you realize.

2380
02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:25.740
Okay.
So anyway,
I just wanted to throw that in.

2381
02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:28.980
You said anything else and I just listening to you talk,

2382
02:23:28.981 --> 02:23:31.470
it gives me hope that everything I want to do is achievable.

2383
02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:36.210
<v 0>There's no doubt about it.
I mean,
I'm,
I'm an average dude that I'm a hard worker.</v>

2384
02:23:36.211 --> 02:23:40.200
I will say that,
but nothing special in any other way.
And I just,
just,

2385
02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:45.200
<v 2>and you're a good person and good people attract good people and you,
you know,</v>

2386
02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:48.020
if you were hard to work with,
people wouldn't work with you.

2387
02:23:48.530 --> 02:23:52.430
And that's one thing I've learned.
Like,
you know,
if you want good people around,

2388
02:23:52.431 --> 02:23:52.950
you have to be good

2389
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:54.680
<v 0>person.
Yeah,
no,
it's,</v>

2390
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:58.710
it's awesome to work with all the guys that I work with before and we're all

2391
02:23:58.711 --> 02:24:00.810
working together again.
As actually with Jason Garner,

2392
02:24:00.811 --> 02:24:03.630
we were just laughing because he got back from his gig.

2393
02:24:03.631 --> 02:24:06.540
I got back from my gig and he was just laughing and saying,
this is so awesome,

2394
02:24:06.541 --> 02:24:07.740
man.
This is so awesome.

2395
02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:10.040
<v 2>Year round.
All the people you were around in uniform,</v>

2396
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:11.930
you can help each other again.

2397
02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:14.400
<v 0>That's what it's all about,
man.
Roger,
when it's all about,</v>

2398
02:24:14.940 --> 02:24:19.940
and speaking of those people in uniform that allow us to do this podcast,

2399
02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:21.540
people like you,
Jody,

2400
02:24:22.050 --> 02:24:26.310
all of our military personnel and and also the police and law enforcement and

2401
02:24:26.311 --> 02:24:30.060
firefighters and paramedics and EMT and correctional officers and border patrol

2402
02:24:30.061 --> 02:24:33.540
and all the first responders that are out there in uniform.

2403
02:24:33.930 --> 02:24:38.550
All of you allow us the freedom and security that we have and that we relish

2404
02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:41.820
every single day that allow us these opportunities.

2405
02:24:41.850 --> 02:24:46.850
So thanks to every single one of you for providing it and to everyone else that

2406
02:24:49.021 --> 02:24:53.860
is listening.
We talk about the path,

2407
02:24:54.890 --> 02:24:55.160
<v 1>okay?</v>

2408
02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:58.220
<v 0>And we talk about discipline and we talk about living clean.</v>

2409
02:24:58.221 --> 02:25:00.440
But it is not an easy path.

2410
02:25:00.441 --> 02:25:05.441
It is filled with temptations and pitfalls and hazards and traps,

2411
02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:09.430
<v 1>okay?</v>

2412
02:25:09.430 --> 02:25:13.330
<v 0>And it's hard to stay on the path.
And if you fall off,</v>

2413
02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:16.780
it can seem even harder to get back on.

2414
02:25:18.190 --> 02:25:19.180
But you can do it,

2415
02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:20.820
<v 1>okay?</v>

2416
02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:25.180
<v 0>You gotta be honest with yourself.
Do not be a slave.</v>

2417
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:31.550
Don't be a slave to drugs or booze or emotion or whatever weakness is trying to

2418
02:25:33.481 --> 02:25:35.430
be your master.

2419
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:41.690
Don't allow it.
Tell the truth.

2420
02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.750
Call out your own weaknesses.

2421
02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:47.450
Then impose discipline.

2422
02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:52.480
Impose your will and climb back up onto the path and set your cell

2423
02:25:55.850 --> 02:25:56.683
<v 1>free.</v>

2424
02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:04.280
<v 0>And until next time,
this is Jody Mitic,
an echo and Jocko</v>

2425
02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:05.880
<v 1>out.</v>
