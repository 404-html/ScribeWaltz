This is Jocko podcast number one 42 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.680
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.410
es La Marshall could be a bragger of the first order I could write on toilet

4
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.340
paper with a crayon and sell.
It was a routine boast,

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.170
but his favorite claim to fame was at first the most puzzling to me and years

6
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:29.640
later the most significant in terms of unraveling the hustler and the phony that

7
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:34.260
he was and how he was nonetheless able to make such a mark on the u s army.

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.450
Slam regularly brought up the fact that the army had made him a general despite

9
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:44.100
his never having attended even one military school and that he was the only

10
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:49.101
general in the army to have this distinction he neglected to say and never would

11
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:54.171
have had I not followed up out of sheer curiosity that he'd gotten his star,

12
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.350
not in the regular army but in the reserves.
Meanwhile,

13
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.270
with no reason not to believe him,
I accepted slam story of World War One.

14
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.800
His experiences as an infantry man in all the major campaigns,

15
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
his battlefield commission to become the youngest second lieutenant in the U s

16
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.420
army during the war,

17
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.610
the romantic tale he spun of Armistice Day when he saw in the end of the war,

18
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.700
sharing his canteens with his brigade commander in the trenches with no reason

19
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:25.440
not to believe him.
I accepted slams,

20
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:29.580
tales of World War II to his participation in the fighting in the Pacific,

21
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.470
as well as his service in Europe,

22
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.310
which had him in the front line of the Normandy invasion.

23
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.220
It would be many,
many,

24
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.280
many years in which slam repeated the stories endlessly in which his reputation

25
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:48.030
was only further bolstered as one or the other appeared in everything from

26
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:49.140
current biography,

27
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:54.141
1953 to the obituaries upon his death in 1977 and in his autobiography published

28
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.910
two years later before I would discover it was all a lie.

29
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.000
Slam had been in an enlisted man with the 315th engineers,

30
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.500
90th Infantry Division during World War One and spent his time not fighting as

31
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:15.501
an infantry man but repairing French road roads until just before the wars and

32
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.790
he had not been battlefield commissioned and he wasn't anywhere near the

33
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.130
trenches on 11 November,

34
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.130
1918 and being instead at the army France based officer candidate school then

35
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:30.510
called infantry candidate school.

36
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.830
The self proclaimed at youngest lieutenant in World War One who in fact never

37
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:37.950
served an officer in any outfit,

38
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.980
regular or reserve in any capacity ever was not commissioned until April,

39
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.650
1919 long after the last angry shots were fired.

40
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.260
According to his service record,

41
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.520
slam saw no infantry combat in World War II either.

42
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.260
Although he was awarded a CIB for the Marshall Islands campaign while serving on

43
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:03.261
the DA staff and far from being on the ground from the earliest hours of the g

44
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.260
six June,
1944 Normandy invasion slammed,

45
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:12.261
didn't even arrive in the European theater theater until July and then it was as

46
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:17.710
a staff officer slash historian reconstructing the operation and while slam

47
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:22.330
would speak with pride of being the only American soldier to serve in all four

48
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.580
of America's Great Wars in the 20th century,

49
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.750
it was a claim more than more than a little deceptive.

50
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.540
His Korean War experience covered exactly three months,

51
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.330
December of 1950 to February,

52
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.330
1951 when he was recalled from the reserve to active duty as a historian slash

53
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.700
operations analysis for the eighth army,

54
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.880
a stint for his country that produced the river and the Gauntlet for himself and

55
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.981
his service in Vietnam was undertaken as a six year retire reserve general and a

56
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:58.000
40 year experience.
Journalist slams job when he wasn't wearing a khaki.

57
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.360
Looking for a story on the army's tab.

58
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.820
A historian as careless with his own history as slam Marshall was,

59
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.020
could hardly be a careful historian,
and Marshall proved the rule.

60
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.720
Veterans have many of the actions he documented in his books have complained

61
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:21.220
bitterly over the years of the inaccuracy or blatant bias

62
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.441
with it.

63
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:28.441
Although the truth was that slam was a fallen and irrevocably smashed idol in my

64
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.980
eyes.
He knew I'd grown away from him throughout our time together,

65
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.930
but it was not something to discuss.

66
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.320
I cherished my career too much to risk getting on his bad side,

67
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.530
and I was opportunists opportunistic enough to see the value of my staying on

68
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.763
the good side.

69
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.330
But there must have been many like me who silence in the face of slams,

70
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:54.331
power only added to it and gave credence to his dubious expertise.

71
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.170
Who allowed him to have an observed amount of influence,
which fed his ego in,

72
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:03.670
lined his purse and for years did an incalculable,

73
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.080
horrific disservice to the army.
The thing he professed a love above all,

74
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.850
not to mention to the nation and to the men who fought and died in Vietnam.

75
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.160
<v 0>When General Johnson had warned me,
take care of with slam.
He's,</v>

77
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.060
he is the army's powerful friend,
but he can be a treacherous enemy.

78
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.260
I had not understood what he meant,
but when I finally did,

79
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.280
I understood too that the chief of staff had gotten it backwards.

80
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.970
The reality was that Slam Marshall was the army's powerful enemy because he was,

81
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.960
it's most treacherous friend and if he were alive today,

82
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.170
perhaps even more than the Vietnam era generals who determinately maintain,

83
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:49.810
we won the war,
we lost in their hands.

84
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.010
Slam Marshall would have plenty to answer for

85
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.820
that.
Right?

86
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.590
There is a section from my favorite book about face by Colonel David Hackworth

87
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:08.591
and he's talking about his experience with a guy by the name of Sla Marshall,

88
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.210
otherwise known as Slam Slam Marshall,

89
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.720
and that's a pretty devastating opening come.
That's a pretty devastating,

90
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.030
that's a pretty bad,
devastating opener.
You can hear what his career was a,

91
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:25.520
so there's a lot of negativity around SLA Marshall.

92
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.510
And for me coming from Hackworth,

93
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.520
that's basically all I need to hear.

94
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.050
That's all I need to hear is when,
when Hackworth,
you know,

95
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.790
goes.
And so Hackworth worked with him and did a tour in Vietnam with him.

96
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.520
They were going around documenting things and he'd got to know him.

97
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.150
And at first he kind of idolized him and I'll talk about that a little bit,

98
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.210
but that,

99
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.400
and that's one of the things that hack mentions in about face was that he had

100
00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:02.081
this huge impact on the army and in hacks says that he used to read his books

101
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.080
over and over again.
And,
and so it's kind of a weird dichotomy.

102
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:11.081
There is that hack got information from some of SLA Marshall's famous books that

103
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:17.180
he wrote about combat,
but then,
and,

104
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.560
but then he turned out to not have told the truth.
So

105
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.680
one of the books that he talks about that he read a bunch is a book called

106
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:32.570
mitigants fire.
And it's based on his interviews and reporting on World War II.

107
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.710
And that book made some claims and some of the claims that the book made are

108
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:41.330
just patently untrue.
Just la,
they're just not true.

109
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.900
And the biggest of the lies is that,

110
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.140
does that right to call it a line,
the biggest of the claims,
maybe it's a lie,

111
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.540
the biggest of the untruths we'll call it,

112
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:58.541
that the biggest of the untruths revolves around this notion that SLA Marshall

113
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:00.260
presents that in combat,

114
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.890
only about 15% of the soldiers on the battlefield in combat actually fires a

115
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:09.590
weapons at all 15%.

116
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.850
Now,
that's a really strange thing to say now.
And,

117
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.800
and knowing what I know now,

118
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.780
I think he may have done that for a couple of reasons and I'm not making

119
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.231
excuses.

120
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.740
I'm saying this is why I think he would do that because there's no excuse for

121
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.690
doing this.
The first is I think he wanted to have a,
uh,
uh,

122
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.110
a theory or a hypothesis that was like kind of shocking and,

123
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.130
and would gain him some publicity.
Right?
That's a shocking thing when you hear,

124
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:43.910
hey,
in combat,
only 15% of people fire their weapons,
right?
You're,
you're going,

125
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.620
what are you talking about?
That's crazy.

126
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.580
So I think he wanted to have something to discuss that would,

127
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.210
that would bring him out to the limelight.
You know,
the shocking claim.

128
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.610
And second,
I think he saw that there was an actual problem.
Right?

129
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.270
That may be not as many people shop there,

130
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:07.440
weapons in combat as should.
And he wanted to fix that problem.

131
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.120
So it was it 85% of the people that weren't shooting the weapon,
no.

132
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.890
But maybe the number was a decent percentage that that didn't shoot or could a

133
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.500
shot more.
Is that possible?
Yeah,
I could say that that's possible.

134
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.820
Maybe not as many people were.

135
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.020
Not as many people were shooting as you would have liked.

136
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.920
So that's,
that's why I think he got focused on that particular subject.

137
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.610
And I think the normal human life things,
right.
I think he had a big ego,

138
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.480
which are actually,
I don't think he did.
He had a big ego.
He was insecure.
Um,

139
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.390
I think he made up some of these other stories which,

140
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.960
which are horrible to make up stories about your combat experiences is a big

141
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.240
mistake.
I think this is,
you know,

142
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:51.840
in many ways this is like one of the first documented cases of stolen valor.

143
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.210
Right?
And obviously I don't like stolen valor.

144
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.680
So there's a lot of negativity around SLA.

145
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:02.910
Marshall and I have to be careful because
I,

146
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.410
it's,
it's very easy for me to throw the baby out with the bath water.
Right?

147
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.420
And when you,
you,
you know,
okay,
so I'm here to learn.
Right?

148
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.540
And despite these very,
very significant character shortfalls,

149
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.710
here's the facts.

150
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.890
The books that he wrote guided the military and had a significant impact on

151
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:29.610
military leaders for many years,
including Hackworth,

152
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.190
including Hackworth.

153
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.520
So eventually I had to look and see what is in these books and what,

154
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.820
if anything,
I could learn from the books.

155
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.290
And I think from my perspective,
okay.
So,

156
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.320
so he did massive amounts of interviews with people and he did have,

157
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.730
you know,
he was okay.
He wasn't Indy day,

158
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.960
he was there a month later interviewing people,
finding out what happened.

159
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.950
So we talked to a lot of people and I think his perspective,

160
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:06.750
and same thing with world war one,
he wasn't there,

161
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:10.950
but he was close to it and he talked to a lot of people and then he spent his

162
00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:14.850
time in the Pacific theater.
He spent time in groups so he had perspective.

163
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.210
It's not the perspective that he claimed to have and if he would have been smart

164
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:20.880
and just said,
look,
I wasn't on the front lines,
but I talked to a lot of people.

165
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.420
I have,
I was in the military.
I have a good perspective.
Here's what I've learned.

166
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.660
If you would've said that,
it would have been fine.

167
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.800
Unfortunately he didn't say that.
Do we throw the baby out with the bath water?

168
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.460
The the,
the,
my initial gut reaction is yes.

169
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.390
Flyer,
right?
Sure.
Right.
Hey,
no,
I'm not going to listen this guy,

170
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.660
but I had to think about it.
If this book influenced the military so much,

171
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.910
and this book in particular,

172
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.410
the book is his men against fire is the big book that he wrote.

173
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.720
I say the big book,
it's the book that he wrote after World War II.

174
00:11:55.721 --> 00:12:00.280
I think it came out in 1947 and it's,

175
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.230
it had a big influence and I can tell you that it had a big influence.

176
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:07.000
It had a big influence.
And this is what's funny.

177
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.980
It had a big influence because despite,

178
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.690
so I guess the facts about his career came out after he died.

179
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:17.710
He died in 1977 in the facts came out some years after that.
Right.

180
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.930
I would hear quotes from SLA Marshall all the time when I was in,

181
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.720
this guy is a known liar.

182
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.800
Again,
maybe that's a harsh word,
but he did not tell the truth.
And you know,

183
00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:37.150
when it comes to like making up what you did in combat,
you kind of,

184
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:42.010
you kind of earn yourself the w the,
the name Liar.
So the guy lied.

185
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.320
And yet I would hear quotes,
uh,

186
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.690
from what he said and what he taught and what he thought.

187
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.210
And a lot of it made sense,
right?
So,

188
00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.420
okay.
Is it true that a,
or even a broken clock is right twice a day?
That's,

189
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.090
that's still a pretty small percentage.
But I'd hear quotes from,

190
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.900
from SLA Marshall that were correct and it wasn't a small number of quotes.

191
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.490
And so I think despite his ego,
despite his lying,

192
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.920
she had a lot of good,

193
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.190
he had gathered a lot of good information and talk to enough people that he

194
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:19.450
actually started to make sense.

195
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.820
And he saw people in multiple different wars again,

196
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:25.480
did he see it to the degree that he claimed to know?
But you know,
there's,

197
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:25.900
there's,

198
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.100
there's a lot of military historians that were never in any kind of combat

199
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:33.280
whatsoever that were never,
even in the military.
There's,

200
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.890
there's plenty of very respected,

201
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.910
I've got books in the queue and I don't know if I'll ever cover him,

202
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:42.970
but I've got books in the queue that are great books about war and about the

203
00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:45.610
military that were written by people that were never in the military.

204
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.210
There's military theorists that were never in the military that I have a great

205
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.550
deal of respect for.
So

206
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.430
then that they say sensible things.
So,
so is there a question of character?
Yes.

207
00:13:57.431 --> 00:14:00.250
Are we going to throw the baby out with the bath water?
I'm going to try not to.

208
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.260
I'm going to try and see what we can learn.

209
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.260
And I think from when I read this book and I read this book a long time ago and

210
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.250
I don't know,
anyways,

211
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.020
I got stuff out of it and I think there's actually,
I'm going to tell you,

212
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.250
I think there's actually a lot to get out of this book and if nothing else,

213
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:25.450
it reflects and reinforces some lessons and bring some other ones,

214
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.330
paints them a little bit more clearly.
So

215
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.830
without further ado,
and I found myself as I was,

216
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.910
as I was reviewing this book again,
um,
it will like about halfway through it,

217
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:41.060
I totally forgot that it was this guy that I consider a liar.
Right?
I was,
yeah,

218
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.050
I got over that.
Right.
Because I'm thinking they have that makes sense.
Yes.

219
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:47.010
That does that.
And he's pulling in quotes from military leaders and

220
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.980
are you with me?
I mean,
does it make sense?
It makes 100%

221
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.120
<v 2>sense.
Cause remember back in the day,
Remember Milli Vanilli remember that?
Those,</v>

222
00:14:56.121 --> 00:15:00.380
that group,
oh you guys the two guys.
Yeah.
So everyone will,
we're liars.

223
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.690
Yeah,
no way.
Yeah.

224
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.860
So it wasn't them singing and all this stuff as it turns out,
as it turns out,

225
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:09.590
but when they were on,
you know,
on the radio and stuff,
but everyone like that,

226
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.970
you know,
they blame it on the rain or whatever the day,
uh,
did they recover?

227
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:18.320
They did not recover from their situation.
Negative and I,
SLA Marshall was dead.

228
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.100
Yeah.
Well one of the guys committed suicide and Milli Vanilli.
It was like,

229
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.090
you know,
he got heavy.
But nonetheless,
the point is,
it's like,
yeah,

230
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.190
it's not them seeing it,
you know,
they're liars or whatever,

231
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:30.350
but the songs were kind of dope.
That's the thing.

232
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.620
So you know the same deal,
Marshall,
Milli Vanilli same thing.
Same,

233
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:37.490
same situation.

234
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.640
I'm saying if you put on one of the Vanilli Milli Vanilli songs right now,

235
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:44.510
I don't bring it right back.
You know,
the dance or whatever,
you know,

236
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.010
it's still good.
It's good.

237
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:50.690
So the guys that actually sang it or why don't you teach those two guys how to

238
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:54.410
sing?
Is that had,
are that are same?
Yes.
So one time not to go too deep into it,

239
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:58.990
but they tried to make it goes to a podcast.
I'll be milli Vanilli into it.

240
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.050
And they were like,
Hey,
we think you,
cause they messed up on stage,
right?

241
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:07.190
The taste is skipped it and well,

242
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.760
and so they're like,
oh my God.
They panicked.
They ran off stage,
all this stuff.

243
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:13.460
They could have just been like,
yeah,
we were lip for that shill.

244
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.090
But then I forget how they handled it,
but then people were like,
hey,

245
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.970
how long does it take?
The guy to kill himself a long time,
years,
you know,

246
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.310
they got exposed to all this stuff,
but he was just,
and so they're like,
um,

247
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.040
they're like,
no,
we'll prove it.
You know?

248
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.350
And then so the people came in and listened to him,

249
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:32.720
like actually seeing in the thing.
It was like,
oh my God,

250
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.710
not even close to these guys can't even sing.
You know,
it's,

251
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.130
you gotta tell the truth about what's going on,
man.
You got to,

252
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.250
that's the thing like how you said like,
why not just get here?

253
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:46.700
The people who really sang those songs,
they were older people,

254
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.040
they were like old,
like 50s or something like that.
Like,

255
00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.780
so they didn't have the pop culture kind of feel.
So they were less marketable.

256
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:58.400
And I did,
did just hire a couple like vocalists.
I mean,

257
00:16:58.401 --> 00:17:03.170
how bad can those guys sing?
Terrible.
The real guys.
All men.
Yeah.

258
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:05.120
You can watch the watch,
the little documentary thing.

259
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:07.850
What and who's looked good and they have fit German accents too.

260
00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:11.280
That's the thing too.
Yeah,
they're from Germany.
Oh.
So it's like,
it's uh,

261
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.690
it's night and day.
There are different and,
but the real people who saying it,

262
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:16.040
they were like,
like I said,
like old,
you know,

263
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:19.610
funky like kind of jazz type people from what I remember.

264
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.900
They're just less Margo,
but just like how you said sure,
they're less marketable.

265
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:28.880
But man,
they're putting out some pretty cool songs.
I mean,
yeah,
I mean,
yeah,

266
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:32.150
I don't know the marketing.
I think that's a big part of it.
I don't know man.

267
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:36.080
But you are right though.
You know,
it's weird.
It's also because the stuff that,

268
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.980
this stuff that SLA Marshall says in this book,
he,
he's making,

269
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.820
he's making statements that they stand on their own.

270
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.830
You don't need to be able to say,
look,
I was here,
so therefore what I'm,

271
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.050
you should listen to

272
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:54.450
<v 0>look,
know the,
the,
the value of what you're saying should stand on its own.</v>

273
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.840
You don't need to be,
you don't need to be,
uh,

274
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.810
have some certain experience.
You know,
it's like Leif and I talk about,

275
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.140
and I would say you can't,
if you're trying to prove a tactic to someone.
Yeah.

276
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.600
Like if I say,
Hey,
when you get in this situation,
here's what you should do.

277
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.250
I shouldn't say because this is how we did it when I was in Baghdad or when I

278
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:18.360
was in Ramadi or when,
whatever,
or when I was in nom nightclub.
Like,
no,

279
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.530
here's the tactic and and look at how it performs.
Go and do a trial run.

280
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:23.910
Go and do some force on force training.

281
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:28.530
You'll see that the tactic works and SLA Marshall,
smart guy,
great writer,

282
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.770
God could have said,
hey,

283
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:35.540
here's these tactics that I learned from these other people that just got out of

284
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.130
it and that wasn't good.
That's a little eagle thing,
isn't it?

285
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:41.250
Just wasn't good enough for him.
Didn't you guys have a name for that one?

286
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.510
Someone would bust that out.

287
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.430
We weep when I was in Baghdad.
Baghdad.

288
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.500
They would always in beggared we did it like this and you can't stand.

289
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:55.980
You can't stand on that.
Right?
Is it good to have experience and say,
Hey,
look,

290
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:59.520
when I was in Baghdad,
this is how we did it.
Perhaps we should try it this way.

291
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.810
That's one thing.
But to say when I was in Baghdad,
this is how we did it.

292
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:07.710
So that's how is the best way to do it,
which is just not true.
It's not true.

293
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.790
Things evolve.
The fundamental principles of combat leadership don't change.

294
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.350
But the tactics that you use can definitely ma,
you have to modify your tactics.

295
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.170
The enemy's gonna modify their tactics,
so you have to adjust as well.

296
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.220
And so to rely on your personal experience as how you bolster your arguments is

297
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:31.590
wrong.
It's,
it's a,
it's an additive.
It's,
it's good to say,
hey look,

298
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:34.110
I've done this before and this is a good way.

299
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:39.111
I remember I had a situation where I was teaching how to go over the beach with

300
00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:45.120
boats,
right?
And I brought up some things and I said,
hey look,

301
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.760
I've done,
and I had happened to have done multiple deployments on a ship.

302
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.810
And when you're on a ship,

303
00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:55.020
you go over the beach a lot and going over the beach is a complicated operation.

304
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:57.420
I don't care.
There's no easy way to do it,
man.

305
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.410
You got gear that's going to flood out and you got waves,
you've got tied,

306
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:04.380
you got served,
you've got sand,
you've got salt water.
It's a nightmare.

307
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.320
And that's one of the things that makes the seals good is that we have to do

308
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:11.670
this.
So when you go,
you,
when you insert any other way,
it's freaking easy.

309
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.640
Like you step off a helicopter,
everything's fine.
You see no use you,
you,
uh,

310
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.830
you could drop out of a vehicle,
everything's fine.
You come over the beach,

311
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.310
everything is a disaster.
There's salt everywhere.
There's water everywhere.

312
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:26.070
Everything's flooded and broken and you're freezing cold.
It just sucks.

313
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.010
And that's our normal mode of operation is right there.

314
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:33.780
So everything else seems easy.
But I had a guy that was saying,
don't,

315
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.420
uh,
don't ever bring the boats in.

316
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.830
And I totally disagreed with that.
It was like,
well,

317
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.100
you have to think about what you're gonna do is basically what I'm saying.

318
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.160
You have to think of what you're going to do if you can avoid,

319
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:55.330
if the boats come in and they flip,
it's a real problem,
right?

320
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.920
It's a real problem.
If there's surf,

321
00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.840
it's a real problem and you need to have like elements ready to just handle the

322
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:05.770
boats because if something goes wrong,
so you can't,

323
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.870
you have to really think about what you're doing in any ways.

324
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.710
I almost fell back on like,
look,
I've done this.

325
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.220
I've done over the beach over and over again.
I know the deal,
right?
It's like,
no,

326
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.830
no,
actually,
because the deal is many times when you look at the surf and you,

327
00:21:19.831 --> 00:21:23.290
you go,
you know what?
We need to swim in.
It's going to suck,

328
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.880
but we need to swim in because risking the boats going through and it's,

329
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.880
there's two,
there's two things that are pulling at you.
The waves are big,
right?

330
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.601
You're thinking,
Hey,

331
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:35.170
we better get the boats to bring us in as actually counterintuitive because the

332
00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:39.070
waves are big man.
You flip a boat over and you've got your,
it's a disaster.

333
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.810
It's a disaster.
So anyways,
I almost relied on the,

334
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:48.220
hey,
this is the way we did it and I've done this a bunch and it's like,
no,

335
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:50.590
that's not Mary.
You have to be explaining,
explain,
okay,
here's what can happen.

336
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.230
Here's the problems and here's the end.
There's problems for both of us.

337
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:54.760
There's times where swimming,
there's times where you don't,

338
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.920
but you have to understand why you're making that decision.

339
00:21:56.921 --> 00:22:01.870
You can't just blanket a decision cause it gets sketchy.
All right.

340
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.130
Anyways,
this is a big introduction to SLA.
Marshall.

341
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:12.500
Here we go.
I've got to say one more thing bro.
And,
and you'll laugh.

342
00:22:12.501 --> 00:22:14.770
And I,
we've written two books about our experiences.

343
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:16.600
They're not there of the leadership books,
but you know,

344
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:19.630
we make it very clear that like,
hey,

345
00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:22.000
this is our memory to the best of our ability.

346
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.680
But there's some things that you just don't,
you,
if you don't know something,

347
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:29.740
he shouldn't make a claim.
But there's something like,
you know,

348
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.360
if you were participating in d day,
you don't mess up that fact.

349
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.730
Like for me to be like,
Hey,
wait,
I,
oh yeah,

350
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:40.360
I was on that mission and someone to be like,
oh well actually you weren't.

351
00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:42.790
I mean,
be like,
well,
when was it?

352
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.090
And while I did whatever I was on hundred operations.
Oh,

353
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.970
I don't know if it's on that one or that.
Well,
you know,
you don't like it.

354
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.340
It's understood,
right?
People make mistakes.
People your memory,

355
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.210
it fades with Emory.
I think Lafe and I,

356
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.740
I mean we in both the intros to extreme ownership and dichotomy leadership,

357
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:58.840
we spell it out,
you know,
this is to the best of our memory.

358
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.450
This is a historical document.
And we,
you know,

359
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.520
at some point I'm sure we'll go back and actually get the dates and explain

360
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:10.000
every single thing that happened by date and who was there and what experiences

361
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:12.310
took place.
They're like,
yeah,
that would be good to have.

362
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.070
And especially now it's probably,

363
00:23:15.071 --> 00:23:17.560
it's all unclassified now cause it's been a long time.

364
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.340
But the kind of errors that he's making in our,

365
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:28.891
like I was at d day or I was in the trenches with my brigade commander on the

366
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.710
day that world war one ended.

367
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.320
Like that's not a small,
like your memory's not gonna forget that.
Right?
Yeah.

368
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.340
It's just not going to happen.

369
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:44.790
So tell the truth and what sucks is this is what sucks.

370
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.160
If you don't

371
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.993
<v 3>tell the truth,</v>

372
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.830
you discredit everything that you've said that actually is truthful.

373
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.010
That's the problem with this book.
That's the problem with his book.

374
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.360
Everything that it basically,

375
00:23:56.361 --> 00:23:58.400
you can take this book and throw it in the garbage can and no one could really

376
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.650
argue with you.
Oh,
that guy lied about a bunch of stuff.
Okay,

377
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:02.770
well throw it in the garbage.
Can I get it?
Yeah.
Yeah.

378
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.490
And if it wasn't for the fact that hack actually had learned a ton from this

379
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:11.210
book,
I would be like,
well,
we'll throw it in the garbage.

380
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:16.750
But if you learn from it and then used what he learned from it to implement in

381
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:19.760
the Korean War and the Vietnam War,
it's like,
okay,
you know what?

382
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:24.680
I'm going to pay attention to it
as a rough dot.
This is a rough that I,

383
00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:28.100
it took me a long time to decide to cover this book actually in that crazy.

384
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.313
It makes sense though.

385
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.630
Totally makes it make sense that it took a long time and it makes sense that

386
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:36.200
we're here right now with book in hand.
Both.
Okay.
I mean more the longtime thing.

387
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:39.290
Of course.
Yeah.
You got to consider just like that what there's like a reporter,

388
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.920
like an,
like a news reporter who like say it,

389
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:47.150
he was in a helicopter and it got to a five of all that was a Hillary Clinton.

390
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.680
She took sniper fire coming,
right reporter that did that too.

391
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.500
And it was like a legit reporter.
And then he said like,

392
00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:57.680
he did took all this stuff and then it was like,
well,
I was in the helicopters,

393
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.850
do like two,
two helicopters behind that.
Uh,
you know,

394
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.060
meanwhile he has some good stuff.
You shouldn't have said that,
you know,

395
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.020
just like,
are you saying you should,

396
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.850
you don't have to say all of that and know that there's something else that

397
00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:12.350
happens.
This catches people when it comes to storytelling.
Okay.

398
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.363
I'm gonna explain this.

399
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.590
If I'm telling you a story about something taking place

400
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.830
and I'm not a great storyteller,

401
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.310
I want you to feel how I felt.
Yeah.

402
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.240
So if I say to you like,

403
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:33.950
let's say I got a mortar that exploded 50 yards from me,

404
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.380
50 yards,
I'm pretty safe,

405
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.380
which could I get fragged sure I could get fragged but I'm pretty safe.

406
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.010
It's still pretty shocking.
Whoa.
It's blowout boom.

407
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.150
And when that first mortar hits you like,
oh wait,
is another mortar gonna hit me?

408
00:25:47.151 --> 00:25:50.840
What's going on?
Well,
when I tell you,
hey,

409
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:56.000
a mortar hit and he hit 50 meters from me,
I'm thinking,
well,

410
00:25:56.001 --> 00:25:59.090
that doesn't really convey how I felt at that moment.

411
00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.790
So you know what I'm going to do?
I'm just going to cut that down a little bit.

412
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.410
I had this mortar hit 10 meters from me and now you're thinking,
oh Dang.

413
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:09.650
Like even you,
I can see it on your face.
You get it now.

414
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.700
So in order for me to try and convey the emotions that I actually felt,

415
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.680
people start to adjust and you gotta be careful of that there.

416
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.470
I don't think they're doing it intentionally.
You know,
I,

417
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.540
I used to put myself in check like,
okay,

418
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.340
I need to tell a good story but I need to keep the facts straight.

419
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.680
Right.
Sketchy.
Get us the thing,
the facts.

420
00:26:32.681 --> 00:26:34.270
So there's a difference between saying a,

421
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.990
this was the biggest explosion you'd ever seen in your life.
You know,

422
00:26:36.991 --> 00:26:41.680
like saying that is different than like this explosion was literally,
you know,

423
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.010
200 feet in the air or something

424
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.120
<v 0>like this where you can say,
oh,
this was a 400 pounds worth of he and T.
Yeah.</v>

425
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:51.240
You can't make those factual,
you can't make those facts with it,
but hey,

426
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:53.940
something hits 50 meters from you and you've never been mortared before.

427
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.440
That will,
that is a scary thing.
Yeah.
It's a scary thing.

428
00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:02.730
Do a metaphor though.
Yes.
But here's what's,
here's what's cool,

429
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.653
or here's what you need.

430
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.770
Here's what I always need to remember when I tell you I got a mortar that landed

431
00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:11.140
50 minutes.
Most people are like,
damn,
that's scary enough.

432
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.600
Need to make it more scary.
Oh yeah.
Let's just keep it real.
Yeah.

433
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:19.230
You even mentioned the smoke trail behind the mortar.
When you see it going up.

434
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:22.850
To me that's scary.
That's scary.
Yeah.
I don't care how many meters away.

435
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.010
It's not really smoke.
It's a,
it's like little sparks,
like a sparkler.
Oh,

436
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:29.260
like a trail king.
That's what it sounds like too.

437
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.860
That even sounds scary by the way.
So,
um,
here we end up,

438
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:36.330
we ended up with SLA Marshall's book.

439
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:41.190
Lots to learn from it and yeah.
So let's get into it.

440
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:46.920
We'll,
we'll,
we'll try and take it for what it's worth.

441
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.310
Yes sir.
And I believe you're going to find,
as I was reviewing this book,

442
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:52.380
I'm like,
yeah,
there's so much good information in here.

443
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.080
Here we go to the book.
In the early years of World War II,

444
00:27:58.081 --> 00:28:02.790
it was the common practice of public spokesman in the United States to magnify

445
00:28:02.791 --> 00:28:04.950
the role of the machine in war,

446
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.970
while minimizing the importance of large forces of well trained foot soldiers.

447
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.190
Hey,
World War II,

448
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.570
we're just going to win this thing with all these big machines were where we're

449
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.673
creating.

450
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:21.810
Once the total contest between national societies is predicated,

451
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.520
it becomes impossible to write off the ultimate clash between the masses of men

452
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:31.290
who fight on foot.
They are the body of the national defense.

453
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.540
There is no other way out.

454
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:35.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

455
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.500
<v 0>The society which looks for an easier way is building its hope on sand</v>

456
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.390
Tim already getting kind of fired up because that's real.
That's real.

457
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:47.443
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

458
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.570
<v 0>Improvisation is the natural order of warfare.</v>

459
00:28:55.010 --> 00:29:00.010
The perfect formulas will continue to be found only on charts.

460
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.020
That's good.

461
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.950
What's the quote that you clipped out of Dave Burke saying,
good deal.
Yeah,

462
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:12.050
good deal.
Dave saying he said it at the muster.
It's not a spreadsheet.

463
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.580
Oh yeah.
This is in a spreadsheet.

464
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.040
This isn't a spreadsheet anymore and that's kind of what I,
that that,

465
00:29:18.041 --> 00:29:21.260
that made me think of that because leadership is not a spreadsheet.

466
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.620
It's not a spreadsheet is not a perfect thing that you can just put out in a

467
00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:26.180
spreadsheet.
Okay,
here's the decision we're going to make.

468
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:30.500
It doesn't work that way.
All right.
Here we go.
Getting back to the book.

469
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:34.220
Since more than a century ago when the rifle bullet began its reign over the

470
00:29:34.221 --> 00:29:38.570
battlefield and soldiers slowly became aware that the day of close order

471
00:29:38.571 --> 00:29:40.610
formations in combat,
what's forever gone.

472
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.380
All military thinkers have pondered the need of a new discipline.

473
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.050
It has been generally realized that fashioning the machine to man's use in

474
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:51.970
battle was,
but half of the problem.

475
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.630
The other half was conditioning man to the machine.

476
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:02.230
The mechanisms of the new warfare do not set their own efficiency rate and

477
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.020
battle.

478
00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:07.730
They are ever at the mercy of training methods which will stimulate the soldier

479
00:30:07.731 --> 00:30:10.850
to express his intelligence and spirit.

480
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:14.750
The philosophy of discipline has adjusted to changing conditions.

481
00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.880
So think about this.
Talking about discipline,

482
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.470
the philosophy of discipline has adjusted to changing conditions as more and

483
00:30:21.471 --> 00:30:24.920
more impact has gone into the hidden power of weapons.

484
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:30.050
Necessity necessitating ever widening deployments of the forces of battle.

485
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.053
Key Part,

486
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:37.210
the quality of the initiative in the individual has become the most praised of

487
00:30:37.581 --> 00:30:38.930
the military virtues.

488
00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.460
So as we got these weapons that can shoot and kill more people at greater

489
00:30:43.461 --> 00:30:46.670
distances,
people got more spread out.
The more spread out people got,

490
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.620
the more it becomes important that you have initiative.
Hmm.

491
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.701
Back to the book.

492
00:30:52.701 --> 00:30:56.180
It has been readily seen that the prevailing tactical conditions increase the

493
00:30:56.181 --> 00:30:58.430
problem of unit coherence in combat.

494
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.180
This the only offset so people are more spread out.

495
00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.350
The only offset for this difficulty was to train for a higher degree of

496
00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.820
individual courage,

497
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.720
comprehension of the situation and self starting character in the soldier.

498
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.390
So the more spread out people get,

499
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.690
the more you have to rely on these individual soldiers to make the right

500
00:31:17.691 --> 00:31:21.200
decisions out there to show initiative that becomes the new discipline.
Hmm.

501
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.890
This decentralized command knows,
by the way,

502
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.410
from this realization have come new concepts of discipline,

503
00:31:30.411 --> 00:31:35.240
which of altered nearly all the major aspects of life and of Human Association

504
00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.890
within Western armies.

505
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:42.100
We've continued to grapple with the problem of how to free the mind of man,

506
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:47.990
how to enlarge his appreciation of his personal worth as a unit in the battle.

507
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:53.120
How to stimulate him to express his individual power within limits,

508
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.580
which are good,
which are for the good of all.

509
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.173
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

510
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.300
<v 0>How do we free the mind?
How do we,
and notice this is a little dichotomy here,</v>

511
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.330
free the mind to express individual power,

512
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.530
but here's the dichotomy within limits which are for the good of all.

513
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.060
So you can't just be doing what's good for you.

514
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.300
You can't just express your be free your mind and do whatever you think is right

515
00:32:15.301 --> 00:32:18.720
for your own purpose.
You need to do it for everyone.
The good for all

516
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.360
back to the book,
it is universally recognized that as the means of war change,

517
00:32:24.361 --> 00:32:28.800
so must the intelligence of man be quick and to keep pace with the changes.

518
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:34.580
Our weakness lies in this that we have never got down to an exact definition of

519
00:32:34.771 --> 00:32:35.700
what we are seeking.

520
00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:40.760
Failing that we fall short in our attempt to formulate in training how best to

521
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:45.761
obtain it and our philosophy of discipline falters at the vital point of it's

522
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:50.480
practical tactical application.
I say that it is a simple thing.

523
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.280
What we need in battle is more and better fire.

524
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.220
What we need to seek and training are any and all means by which we can increase

525
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:04.100
the ratio of effective fire.
When we have to go to war.

526
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:08.030
The discipline training methods and the personal policies of our forces should

527
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:11.180
all be regulated to conform with this one fundamental need.

528
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.100
Now you can see what he's getting at here.
This is his big statement.

529
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:20.030
This is his big hypotheses,
so it's,
it's actually he says,

530
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.570
I say it's a simple thing.
We what we need in battle is more and better fire.

531
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:28.580
That's his big statement.
I don't agree with that.
Like there's other things.

532
00:33:28.581 --> 00:33:30.200
There's a lot of other things going on in leadership.

533
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.290
I think actually the things that he talked about prior to this are more

534
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:34.160
important than fire.

535
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.180
Decentralized Command and making people take initiative and having people step

536
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:40.490
up and do the right thing for the entire team,

537
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.840
but with a free mind making these things happen and for some reason he just

538
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.200
bypasses all that super important stuff.
It says,
Hey,
no,

539
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:52.040
the most potent thing we need is more and better.
Fire.
Fire is important.

540
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.940
Hell yes.
Fires important.
That's why I love machine gunners.

541
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:58.190
It's all my machine gunners out there.
God bless you.

542
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:04.130
You lay down the fire to all the supporting fire elements out there.
Artillery,

543
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.810
close air,
love via,
thank you.
We need more fire.
I agree with that,

544
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.510
but that's not,
that's not the,

545
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:16.640
it's not the thing that we narrow everything down to which is his hypothesis.

546
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.980
So lot of good information there.
He narrows it down to a different direction.

547
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.280
Don't agree with it.
And actually I'll go ahead and say not true.

548
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:29.540
It's all these factors that we need to improve.
Fire is not the sole thing.

549
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.760
Fire is absolutely important.
Fire winds firefights absolutely.

550
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.770
Fire maneuver,
cover and move for firefights.
It helps.

551
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.170
So fire helps when firefights it doesn't when it on.
So yeah,

552
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.160
next chapter's called on future war.

553
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.310
He says the battlefield is the epitome of war.

554
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.110
All else war when war is perfectly conducted exist,

555
00:34:53.111 --> 00:34:57.200
but to serve the forces of the battlefield and to assure final success on the

556
00:34:57.201 --> 00:35:01.790
field,
it is on the battlefield that the issues of war are decided.

557
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:06.230
Check,
concur.

558
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:12.460
It should be noted that all military power is dependent on civil will.

559
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.670
It is the nation and not the army,
which makes war.

560
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:21.710
So I've talked about that before.
The will,
you got to have the will.

561
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.250
If you don't have the will as a nation,
you're not going to win.

562
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.740
And then I've talked about it before.

563
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.130
The wheels you got to have are the wheels to the will to kill and the will to

564
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:34.790
die cause that's what war is.
It's killing and dying and if you don't have those,

565
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.040
if you don't have the will to do those two things,

566
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.860
you should not be entering more because the outcome is not going to be good.

567
00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.890
Every improvement in weapon power is aimed at lessening the danger on one side

568
00:35:47.891 --> 00:35:50.650
by increasing it on the other.
Consequently,

569
00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.640
every improvement in weapons is eventually met by a counter improvement.

570
00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.800
Best Jujitsu,
right?
You've got the counter right?
Come up with a new move.

571
00:35:59.801 --> 00:36:02.260
Guess what?
Somebody's going to come up with a move to counter it.

572
00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:07.270
That's always happening with weapons.
I like this little wine right here.

573
00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.480
Decision in war is a clinching act.

574
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.060
It is the action which finally delivers the victory,
surely into one's hands,

575
00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:20.920
decision,
decisiveness,
making the call.
That's what you need to do.

576
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.830
Next chapter man on the battlefield,

577
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.200
on the battlefield,

578
00:36:29.201 --> 00:36:34.201
the real enemy is fear and not the bayonet or bullet all means of union of

579
00:36:34.361 --> 00:36:36.820
power,
Demand Union of knowledge.

580
00:36:36.821 --> 00:36:40.630
That's a quote from Robert Jackson and he continues here.

581
00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:45.520
It is of the battlefield that I speak in saying that the mind of the infantry

582
00:36:45.521 --> 00:36:49.540
soldier should be conditioned to an understanding of its reality through all

583
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:52.020
stages of his training.
[inaudible].

584
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.210
That's one of the reasons why I heard so many quotes about SLA Marshall is while

585
00:36:56.211 --> 00:36:57.100
we were getting trained,

586
00:36:57.101 --> 00:37:02.101
people would refer back to SLA Marshall and when I ran trading I knew I had to

587
00:37:02.651 --> 00:37:04.840
bring it up sometimes cause I'd say,
look,
here's what's going on.

588
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.350
We need to think about this and I'll get to some of those points later.

589
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.370
But training is his methodology.
When he wrote this book,

590
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.020
part of the focus is like,
hey,

591
00:37:14.021 --> 00:37:18.910
we need to train people differently and and what he says about training is 100%

592
00:37:18.911 --> 00:37:23.000
valid,
100% valid
back to the book.

593
00:37:23.001 --> 00:37:27.830
He needs to be taught the nature of the field as it is in war and as he may

594
00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:31.760
experience it someday for if he does not acquire a soldier's view of the field,

595
00:37:31.761 --> 00:37:35.870
has image of it will be formed from the reading of novels or the romance written

596
00:37:35.871 --> 00:37:38.750
by war correspondents of which he was one.
By the way,

597
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:44.720
or from the viewing of or or from viewing the battlefield as it is imagined to

598
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:45.740
be by Hollywood.

599
00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.700
One of the purposes of training should be to remove these false ideas of battle

600
00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:52.220
from his mind.
Totally agree.
Absolutely.

601
00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.950
To give the soldier a correct [inaudible] concept of battle is a far different

602
00:37:57.951 --> 00:38:01.510
thing from encouraging him to think about war.
This is it.

603
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.600
So thinking about what I just said,

604
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:07.610
to give the soldier a correct concept of battle is a far different thing from

605
00:38:07.611 --> 00:38:09.380
encouraging him to think about war.

606
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.270
The ladder is too vast a canvas.
It includes too much detail,

607
00:38:14.271 --> 00:38:19.010
which is confusing to his mind and immaterial to his personal problem.
He's like,

608
00:38:19.011 --> 00:38:21.080
don't think about this big picture.
You need.
Think about what's happening.

609
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.150
We have surpassed all other armies and outstripped common sense in our effort to

610
00:38:26.151 --> 00:38:29.870
teach man something about war.
He's counseled about wars causes,

611
00:38:29.871 --> 00:38:32.810
which is a good thing on which those rare occasions when he is,

612
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.910
when the instruction is in qualified hands,

613
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:39.190
he's told about how the soldiers and sailors of other nations observe Kersey and

614
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:40.120
foster tradition.

615
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:44.110
He is even board by lectures on the strategy and logistics of high command,

616
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.020
but he does not get what he requires most.

617
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:51.310
The simple details of common human experience on the field of battle.

618
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:52.300
As a result,

619
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:57.330
he goes to the supreme leak testing experience of his lifetime as it almost a

620
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:02.320
total stranger.
So you learn all these,
and you know what?

621
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:07.090
Actually when Lafe took over the junior officer's course coming out of buds,

622
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.270
it was very focused on the big picture stuff.

623
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.380
And it wasn't helping these guys being prepared to be in a seal platoon.

624
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.990
And life was like,
no,
I gotta change this.
W He,

625
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.430
you can still talk about the stuff and it's important to,
you don't throw it out,

626
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:27.150
but you got to teach people what the human experience on the battlefield is and

627
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.720
that's what they've tried to do.

628
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:31.240
And that's what I tried to do when I took over training and my training was

629
00:39:31.241 --> 00:39:32.620
further along when I took it over.
You know,

630
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:37.180
we were already moving in that direction.
We're heading already reflected that.

631
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:42.420
But a lot of the stuff that leaf was being taught in [inaudible] course was not

632
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.770
<v 1>okay.</v>

633
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.010
<v 0>The human experience on the field of battle Lafe try to get that in there and he</v>

634
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:52.540
did a good job of it.
And back to the book,
the price for failure.
So the,

635
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.090
so you're talking about to train these people pro correctly,

636
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.090
the price for failure is paid all up and down the line.

637
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:03.310
Men Go into action the first time haltingly and groping Lee as if they were lost

638
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.170
at night in the deep woods.
Lives are wasted unnecessarily.
Time is lost.

639
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.720
Ground that might be taken is overlooked.

640
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.850
It is not necessary that these misfortunes befall organizations simply because

641
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:16.810
they are new to battle.

642
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.580
It is possible that the infantry soldier can be trained to anticipate fully the

643
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:23.050
true conditions of the battlefield.

644
00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:27.610
It is possible that units can be schooled to take full and prompt action against

645
00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:30.730
dispute against the dis unifying effect of these conditions.

646
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.410
Fear his ever presence,

647
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.180
but the but is the uncontrolled fear that is the enemy of successful operation

648
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:40.690
and the control of fear depends upon the extent to which all dangers and

649
00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:44.620
distractions maybe correctly anticipated and therefore understood.

650
00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.450
You gotta simulate battle.

651
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.110
That's what you got to do and they did a great job when I was going through my

652
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:51.670
workups,
they did a great job of doing that.

653
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:55.120
When I took over and was running training,
we brought it even to the next level.

654
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:59.680
It was freaking mayhem out there and I had many people and we're going to have

655
00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:02.620
some guys that are retiring in the future that are coming on the podcast that

656
00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:04.180
went through my workups.

657
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:09.160
They will tell you being an actual combat was easier.
It was easier,

658
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.240
and that's what my goal was.
We want this train,
he'd be so chaotic.

659
00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:14.890
And what you think about this right here,

660
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.670
when you think about law enforcement training should be the same way you want

661
00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:20.560
these guys completely tested.

662
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.110
You want it to be harder than anybody they ever have to deal with.

663
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:25.420
You want the situation to be more stressful than they're going to deal with in

664
00:41:25.421 --> 00:41:27.520
real life.
And that's how you get them prepared.

665
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.650
<v 1>Okay?</v>

666
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.560
<v 0>Next.
The heart of the matter is to relate to man,</v>

667
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:38.450
is to relate the man to his fellow soldier as he will find him on the field of

668
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:39.284
combat,

669
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.320
to condition him to human nature as he will learn to depend on it when the

670
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:49.280
ground offers him no comfort and weapons fail.
He talks a lot about human nature.

671
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.060
I talk a lot about human nature.
When you were,

672
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.440
when you'd hear about this,
Oh,
this guy,
you know,
this book,

673
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.510
did you know that he was a faker back then?
It was,
yes,

674
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.200
but it was,
uh,

675
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.000
you know how there's two sides to every story.

676
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:12.680
It seemed like to me until I read about face and I was like,
okay,

677
00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:16.790
there's the actual side.
There's the actual side is cause you know,

678
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:20.570
Hackworth said,
look,
this is what he actually did.
Here's his military records.
So,

679
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.330
but up until I read about face,
it was kind of like,
oh absolutely.

680
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:27.480
There's some weird stuff about his career,
but you know,
kind of what is it?

681
00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:32.340
Gray area.
But not everyone.

682
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.950
Some people would talk about him like he was the man without any demerits

683
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:39.980
against him,
without any question against them.
Right.

684
00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:44.520
Which kind of adds to the little hodgepodge opinions will,
that was,

685
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.950
that was a crazy thing.

686
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.530
I mean when Hackworth was just talking about opening that I read,

687
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.040
this is something that is just,
when you read it,
you go,
Oh God.

688
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:57.430
So he's saying that Hackworth is saying that basically he,

689
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.730
he didn't want to bring up the fact he stayed on his good side.
Right?
Hey,

690
00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:07.790
he valued his career.
Um,
slam had a lot of power,

691
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:09.350
so he's just gonna stay on his good side.

692
00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.230
And then he saying how many other guys were doing that?

693
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.860
How many guys were just staying on SLA,
Marshall's good side.

694
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:20.630
Cause they wanted to continue their career and,
and in order to do that,

695
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:22.340
they're like,
oh,
you know what?
I'm not gonna say anything about it.

696
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:27.290
And that actually bolsters his power cause Hackworth at this time,
right?

697
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.310
If you get a blessing from Hackworth,
it's like that's real pod.
Remember what,

698
00:43:31.311 --> 00:43:34.910
remember what Moocs,
Jim Mooky Yama said about Hackworth.
He's like,

699
00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:38.450
everybody knew Hackworth.
Everybody knew him.
He was mister infantry.

700
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.340
Coolest nickname ever.
By the way,

701
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.910
if I come back in another world,

702
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.690
I'm going to do whatever it takes to earn the nickname Mr Infantry.

703
00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:53.720
That's just as legit as it gets.
So,
but when you got Hackworth going,

704
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.690
Oh yeah,
yeah,
I worked with slam.
Good guy.
Right?
That's a little,

705
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.660
oh that's Hackworth saying that.
So it's,
it's like,

706
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.570
and now there's other generals are saying this because everybody just wants to

707
00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:05.210
protect a little career and he's saying he was opportunistic because this is

708
00:44:05.211 --> 00:44:08.600
Hackworth coming out straight up,
calling himself guilty.
Yeah.

709
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.880
So do you think this happens all the time though,
right?
It happens all the time.

710
00:44:13.881 --> 00:44:18.150
Do you think that it's kind of in a way your duty to,
to,

711
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.710
to kind of call it out?
Okay.
There's two ways to answer that question.

712
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:27.190
If you call it out and it doesn't work and you get blacklisted by Sla Marshall

713
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.860
and now you don't make rank and now you're not in charge and they shove you off

714
00:44:30.861 --> 00:44:32.100
to some bill at,
over in

715
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.620
<v 3>wherever
and now you have no,
no more influence.
Did you do a good job?</v>

716
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.690
Did you make a right call?

717
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.300
If you play the game and you just go along with it and you try and get yourself

718
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:47.910
to a position of power where you can actually have more influence than you would

719
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:52.440
have had and you had to,
you had to bite your tongue.
Was that the good move?

720
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.310
But what if you didn't really get to where you want it to be in now you

721
00:44:56.311 --> 00:44:58.080
accelerated him and he turned it again.
You know what I mean?

722
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.680
That's a very tough decision to make and that's why that's why you gotta be gets

723
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.420
why you got to be tactful.
You got to think about what's going on.

724
00:45:04.421 --> 00:45:06.960
Do got to think about the longterm consequences of what you're about to do.

725
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:08.280
That's why leadership is challenging.

726
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.110
And that's why playing these political games,

727
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:12.510
which you have to play in every different organization,

728
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.970
people don't think there's political games in the military.
Golf,

729
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.050
it's a big political game.

730
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.370
It's a big giant political game and same thing in co companies.
Corporations.

731
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:24.200
Yeah.
Right.
That's the way the world works.
You got to play the game.
Yeah.

732
00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:26.580
So like even socially,
you know,

733
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.840
where let's say you know a person and I've been in this situation before and not

734
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:35.160
even necessarily in it,
I'm not saying that,
not saying that either,

735
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:39.320
but I'm saying plausible deniability and it just came out Charles.

736
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.290
But you know,
you know of somebody who,
um,
they're,

737
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:48.130
they're like a complete like faker buyer and you know,
the,
the,
I don't,

738
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:51.540
you know,
just some saints,
you know,
social scenario where,
you know,

739
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.510
they have a nice car but then they owe like 10 people,

740
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.290
like tens of thousands of dollars because of how they screwed him over in

741
00:45:58.291 --> 00:46:01.860
something like their friends and all this stuff.
Right.
Meanwhile,

742
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.660
there's a small group of people who know all about that stuff and then we see

743
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.780
the,
you know,
we'll see.

744
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.800
Or you'll see this person as this huge faker going around town as this huge

745
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.170
faker.
Um,

746
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.320
but everyone else who's not in it and sees him as this great person who's like,

747
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.430
you know,
whatever.

748
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:23.940
Is it your duty on a social level seem saying like ti to be like,
hey,

749
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.550
because you know,
I guess it could be said like,
hey,

750
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.300
you're kind of protecting other people from getting screwed in that same way for

751
00:46:30.301 --> 00:46:33.500
sure.
But at the same time it's like,
yeah,
do it.

752
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.180
Especially if you don't have a dog in the fight.
I have to look at what the,
what,

753
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.810
what is this person doing that's benefiting anyone if all they're doing is

754
00:46:39.811 --> 00:46:44.040
screwing people over?
Mom going to say something.
For sure.
Yeah.
If this person,

755
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:47.760
if this individual was somehow,
you know,

756
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.320
running a big charity organization,
right,
right,
right.
That's a legit thing.
Right.

757
00:46:52.321 --> 00:46:55.380
That could happen.
He's donate money or getting people to donate or whatever.

758
00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:00.750
Maybe I'd try and mitigate it more,
but you know,

759
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:03.600
in a social situation just first and just sounds like they're going to screw

760
00:47:03.601 --> 00:47:08.070
people over.
I think I'm going to,
I think I'm going to drop dime.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

761
00:47:08.071 --> 00:47:11.850
On on one hand you're kind of like,
yeah,
let me let me,
and not the kind,

762
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:16.650
you're not going to go on the radio or something and broadcast it on the radio.

763
00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:19.380
All of these direct,
right.
You can go,
you can go on the social media.

764
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.880
That's what I mean.
But you're not going to go on and announce these things.

765
00:47:23.881 --> 00:47:26.270
It's just like if it ever comes up,
here's,
you know,
here's a,

766
00:47:26.271 --> 00:47:30.250
here's a situation that could unfold.
If you call this person out

767
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.390
<v 0>now that no,
now they stop whatever form of income they have now,</v>

768
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:37.270
no one that they owes money to is actually going to ever get paid back.
Right?

769
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.490
Isn't that could be problematic.
Yeah.

770
00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.890
Or you now you have like a little conflict with this person.

771
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.530
Now you got to deal with whatever comes of that.

772
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.490
I'm saying it's kind of like don't like,
what do you call it?
We need,
you know,

773
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.090
muddy the waters or whatever,
like don't disturb the waters kind of thing.

774
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.710
And then hopefully,

775
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.390
which usually actually is the case in social in social situations where they're

776
00:47:58.391 --> 00:48:02.170
going to play themselves anyway.
So yeah,
that's true.
That gets out.

777
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:05.570
You can't like,
but I don't like people taking people's money.
Yeah.

778
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.130
So I'm going to have a problem with this person.
Yeah.
That's the bottom line.

779
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:12.250
Yeah.
Fully.
And I think most people,
that's how it is.
You know,

780
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:14.890
they didn't like that.
So,
and I think the weird thing is social people,

781
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:18.120
they don't,
they don't,
they don't,
they don't be coming around me if they,

782
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.800
I kind of give off the vibe of like,
Hey,

783
00:48:20.801 --> 00:48:23.020
you don't want to be acting that way around me.
Yeah.

784
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.540
So I don't have a lot of people like that hanging around.

785
00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.740
<v 5>Yeah.
There it is.</v>

786
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.040
Going back to the book,

787
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.560
<v 0>only when human rather than material aspects of operation are put upper most can</v>

788
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:41.470
tactical bodies be conditioned to make the most of their potential unity.

789
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.260
<v 5>Okay.</v>

790
00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.690
<v 0>So the human being,
he's saying that human beings are more important.</v>

791
00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:51.180
It is beyond question that the most serious and repeated breakdowns on the field

792
00:48:51.181 --> 00:48:56.181
of combat are caused by failure of controls over human nature.

793
00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:58.870
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

794
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:59.770
<v 0>but Marie,
that again,</v>

795
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:04.140
it is beyond question that the most serious and repeated breakdowns on the field

796
00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:08.160
of combat are caused by failure of the controls over human nature.

797
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:13.350
Not Tactics,
not weapons,
not machinery,
not physical strength,

798
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:17.730
but human nature.
And guess what?
I agree with that.

799
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.160
<v 5>I agree with that.</v>

800
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.520
<v 0>We all granted the soldier must be trained for initiative and encouraged to</v>

801
00:49:26.521 --> 00:49:30.210
think about what is problem while in combat.

802
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.250
So he,
again,

803
00:49:32.251 --> 00:49:34.690
he talks about a lot about initiative and that's one of the things that

804
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:40.380
that I think was very positive and that's one of the things that influenced me

805
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.100
knowing that it was important for people to have initiative and knowing that you

806
00:49:44.101 --> 00:49:46.560
can't control what everyone on the battlefield and understanding decentralized

807
00:49:46.561 --> 00:49:48.030
command back to the book,

808
00:49:48.031 --> 00:49:51.750
our training methods are conditioned by the ideal of automatic response.

809
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.710
So he's saying like,
we think that the best thing,

810
00:49:55.711 --> 00:50:00.090
the best ideal is just automatic response.
That's what we want.
At the same time.

811
00:50:00.091 --> 00:50:04.920
Our observation of the battlefields reality makes it clear to us that we need

812
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:09.980
men who can think through their situation and steel themselves for action

813
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:14.340
according to the situation,
so we don't want automatic response.

814
00:50:14.341 --> 00:50:17.220
We want people that can think the thinking soldier,

815
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:22.260
the man who's trained for self starting cannot be matured in a school which

816
00:50:22.261 --> 00:50:27.261
holds to the vestiges of Bulla belief that automatic action is the ideal thing

817
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.600
in the soldier.
Again,
this is undeniable,

818
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:37.250
undeniable.
We want people that are there things think for themselves.

819
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.980
I hold it to be one of the simplest truths of war,

820
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.210
that the thing which enables an infantry soldier to keep going with his weapons

821
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.930
is the near presence or the presumed presence of a comrade.

822
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.970
It happened too frequently in our army.

823
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.900
That aligned company was careless about the manner in which it received a new

824
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:00.734
replacement.

825
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.730
The Stranger was not introduced to his superiors nor was there time for him to

826
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:08.840
feel the friendly interest of his immediate associates before he was ordered

827
00:51:08.841 --> 00:51:10.400
forward with the attack.

828
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.960
The result was the man's total failure in battle and has returned to the rear as

829
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:16.010
a mental case.

830
00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:22.060
So it is far more than a question of the soldiers need a physical support from

831
00:51:22.061 --> 00:51:22.810
other men.

832
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:27.810
He must have at least some feeling of spiritual unity with them if he used to do

833
00:51:28.601 --> 00:51:32.460
an efficient job of moving and fighting.
This is very important,

834
00:51:32.461 --> 00:51:33.970
and I work with companies all the time.

835
00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:39.520
So you take an army unit and you throw a random guy in there,

836
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.310
a random replacement and no one meets him and no one talks to him and all of a

837
00:51:42.311 --> 00:51:43.720
sudden they're going on in attack.
He's going to fail.

838
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.150
That's the statement because he doesn't,

839
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:49.720
he doesn't know anyone else and he goes more into detail on this in the in the

840
00:51:49.721 --> 00:51:50.410
book.

841
00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.830
But that happens with companies where they have some new new person check on

842
00:51:53.831 --> 00:51:57.220
board,
they get hired,
they check on board.
No one meets him.
No one greets him.

843
00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.400
No one becomes friends with them.
They're in their own isolated little world.

844
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:04.310
The pressure starts to come and they bail or they break.
Yeah,
I think so.

845
00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:09.010
He talks more about this in chapter four,
which is called combat isolation.

846
00:52:09.011 --> 00:52:13.210
And there's a quote that it starts off from Major General Charles W,
O Daniel,

847
00:52:13.211 --> 00:52:14.044
and it says,

848
00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:19.060
the finest theories in most minute plans often crumble.

849
00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.530
Complex systems fall by the wayside.

850
00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:29.310
Parade ground formations disappear are splendidly trained leaders vanish.

851
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:35.050
The good men,
which we had at the beginning are gone.

852
00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:39.520
The raw truth is before us,
right?

853
00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.840
That's good,
right?
Yeah.

854
00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:49.140
And obviously law of combat number to keep things simple,

855
00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.390
that's exactly what he's talking about.
You got to keep things simple.

856
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:56.740
But he's also saying that everything that you come up with these complex things,

857
00:52:56.741 --> 00:52:59.020
they're going to fall apart in combat.
That's what happens.

858
00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:04.390
And now we talk,
talking about the name of the chapters,
combat I isolation.

859
00:53:04.391 --> 00:53:09.391
And he starts talking about what it's like when these soldiers get on the

860
00:53:09.821 --> 00:53:10.391
battlefield.

861
00:53:10.391 --> 00:53:14.860
He's talking about the battlefields cold and it's harsh and it's empty and

862
00:53:14.861 --> 00:53:19.000
there's,
it's it chills a man's soul is what he's saying.

863
00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.480
And then when the fire starts here,
we go back to the book.

864
00:53:22.481 --> 00:53:27.390
He finds himself suddenly almost alone in his hour of greatest danger and he can

865
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:31.080
feel the danger,
but there is nothing out there,
nothing to contend against.

866
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:36.320
It is from the mixture of mystification and fear that there comes the feeling of

867
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:39.870
helplessness,
which in turn produces greater fear.

868
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.460
That is what green troops are up against time and again,

869
00:53:44.461 --> 00:53:47.850
I have heard them say after their first try at combat by God,

870
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:49.440
there was never a situation like it.

871
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.560
We saw no one we were fighting phantoms and is frequently they have and as

872
00:53:55.501 --> 00:53:59.790
frequently they have added this though their convictions about the matter.

873
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:04.380
We're wholly at odds with the fact of the situation.
We had to do it all alone.

874
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.660
We got no support on either flank.

875
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.470
So he's talking about the fact that where you feel alone on the battlefield and

876
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.950
the fact that guys would come back and say,

877
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.680
even though they were fully supportive,
it didn't matter.
They fought.

878
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:23.370
They were a little out there and that that's what he's talking about.

879
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.510
He goes on the enemy.
Now he's talking about if firefights situation,

880
00:54:27.511 --> 00:54:31.260
the enemy fire builds up.
Its aim becomes true or the man spread.

881
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.190
The men spread further and further from each other moving individually to

882
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:37.890
whatever cover his nearest or affords the best protection.

883
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.350
A few of them fire their pieces.

884
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:45.710
At first they do so almost timidly as if fearing a rebuke for wasting ammunition

885
00:54:45.931 --> 00:54:48.300
when they do not see the enemy.
Others do nothing.

886
00:54:48.301 --> 00:54:52.020
Some fail to act mainly because they are puzzled what to do and their leaders do

887
00:54:52.021 --> 00:54:52.860
not tell them.

888
00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.350
Others are wholly unnerved and can neither think nor move insensible relation to

889
00:54:58.351 --> 00:54:59.184
the situation.

890
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:04.200
Such response as the men make have to enemy fire tens mainly to produce greater

891
00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:07.740
separation in the elements of the company,
thereby intensifying,

892
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:13.040
intensifying the feeling of isolation and the insecurity of its individuals.

893
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:17.430
The junior leaders are affected as much as the rifle files,

894
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.660
so when chaos starts,
people start to be alone.

895
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.710
That again,
this can apply to the battlefield.

896
00:55:26.711 --> 00:55:28.750
This can apply to the business world.
When chaos starts,

897
00:55:28.751 --> 00:55:30.430
people start to focus on their own little world.

898
00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:35.710
And the more you focus on your own little world,
the more separation there is,

899
00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:39.190
the less a unity there is in the,
in your unit to make something happen.

900
00:55:39.191 --> 00:55:41.020
Now he goes on back to the book.

901
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:46.050
Could one clear commanding voice be raised even though it be the voice of an

902
00:55:46.511 --> 00:55:50.500
individual without titular a 40 they would obey,

903
00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:55.030
or at least the stronger characters would do,
would do so,

904
00:55:55.031 --> 00:55:59.140
and the weaker would begin to take heart because something is being done.

905
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.960
I got to see this over and when I was running training,

906
00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:08.220
got to these over and over and over and over again.
As matter of fact,

907
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:09.240
we,
uh,

908
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.240
lay road chapter about it in the dichotomy of leadership of situations where one

909
00:56:14.311 --> 00:56:18.570
situation in particular,
where there was no voice,
no one's taking charge.

910
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.380
Finally,
someone steps up and take charge and it's like,
boom,
everything changes.

911
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:27.310
But clear commanding voices are all too rare on the battle,

912
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.500
on the field of battle.
So they wait,

913
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:34.030
doing nothing and inaction takes further toll on their resolve.

914
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:39.310
More grievous losses will no doubt come to this band of men in time.

915
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:42.790
But as a company,
this is the worst hour that they will ever know.

916
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.060
So it's a downward spiral.
If no one steps up and starts making calls,

917
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:48.370
you start taking casualties.
Now if people panic even more,

918
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:49.750
they get more than their own little world.

919
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.610
They become more detached from each other.

920
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:54.040
Less unity of what you're trying to make happen.

921
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:56.680
<v 1>Okay?</v>

922
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.310
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

923
00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:01.360
It would serve no purpose to dwell on the discouraging detail of this ordeal if

924
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:05.650
it were not for the belief that much of the is unnecessary and that the infantry

925
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:07.270
soldier can find a better way.

926
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:14.040
One must not come to rest on Clausewitz gloomy warning that quote in war,

927
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:20.880
the novice is met only by pitch black night.

928
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:25.750
On beyond that,
there are words to be read.

929
00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:31.280
It is of the first importance that the soldier higher low should not have to

930
00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:32.950
encounter in war things.

931
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:37.951
Which scene for the first time set him in terror or perplexity.

932
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.170
So that's cost.
Talking about training.

933
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:44.530
You've got to get people ready for this chaos and mayhem.
You've got to get it,

934
00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:46.780
get them ready for it.
You've got to get them ready.

935
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:50.770
You got to show them that when people panic and people are are getting
separated,

936
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:52.480
that one commanding voice go on.

937
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:57.160
Leaders stepping up and leading will have a massive impact on the situation and

938
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:58.000
failure to do that.

939
00:57:58.001 --> 00:58:01.150
We'll also have a massive impact but it will be a massive negative impact.

940
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:11.470
Now he talks chapter five is called ratio of fire and here we get into his

941
00:58:11.691 --> 00:58:14.280
little hypotheses.
I'm not going to waste a lot of time on it,

942
00:58:14.281 --> 00:58:16.520
but I'm going to bring it up back to the book.
Now,

943
00:58:16.521 --> 00:58:20.750
I do not think I've seen it stated in the military manuals of this age or an any

944
00:58:20.751 --> 00:58:24.500
of the writings meant for the instruction of those who lead troops that a

945
00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:28.640
commander of infantry will be well advised to believe that when he engages the

946
00:58:28.641 --> 00:58:29.150
enemy,

947
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:33.100
not more than one quarter of his men will ever strike a real blow unless they

948
00:58:33.101 --> 00:58:33.410
are,

949
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:38.410
unless they are compelled by almost overpowering circumstances or unless all

950
00:58:38.931 --> 00:58:43.931
junior leaders constantly ride herd on troops with specific mission of

951
00:58:43.941 --> 00:58:45.140
increasing their fire.

952
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:51.010
The 25% estimate stands for even for well trained and campaign season troops.

953
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:56.090
I mean that 75% will not fire,

954
00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.780
will not persist in firing against the enemy and his works.

955
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:03.440
These men may face danger but will not fight.

956
00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.660
So that's his hypothesis.

957
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:09.350
And actually the beginning of this book has a foreword in it that I'm just going

958
00:59:09.351 --> 00:59:13.550
to touch on.
The forwards is written by a guy named Russell Glen and he,

959
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:18.970
he points out some of the disputes against this.

960
00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:25.220
What about this?
This low ratio fire.
So he,
we go back to the book.

961
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:27.500
This is the introduction.
So this isn't SLA.
Marshall,

962
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:32.501
this is from the introduction from Russell Glen Marshall's ratio of fire values

963
00:59:32.571 --> 00:59:37.571
did not go unchallenged even when they first appeared in 1947 general James Am

964
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:43.370
Gavin,
World War II commander of the 82nd airborne division discounted the low

965
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:47.090
estimates,
as did Harry w o Canard,

966
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.170
who served in the hundred and first airborne division in every one of its combat

967
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:55.100
actions during World War II and later commanded the first cavalry division in

968
00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:59.000
Vietnam.
Well,
legendary General Bruce Clark,

969
00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:03.440
commander of the u s forces that defended St biff during the battle of the
bulge,

970
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.130
flatly discounted Marshall finding his values,

971
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:11.540
ridiculous and dangerous assertions,
absolute nonsense.

972
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.890
Another combat veteran,
British author,

973
01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:21.100
George McDonald Frazier instead question Marshall's explanations for why

974
01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:25.690
soldiers fail to engage the enemy.
Frazier had served.

975
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:30.530
So one of the things that Marshall says is that people aren't,

976
01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.770
aren't,
are taught not to kill.
And you know,

977
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:39.020
it's against the commandments of God and it's bad to kill.

978
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.790
And so that's one of the things we have a moral and inherent moral objection to

979
01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:48.170
killing.
And so,
so this guy,
Donald Frazier Frazier,

980
01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:50.030
had served in Burma as an infantry men,

981
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:54.350
though he recognized that moral upbringing might influence men's behavior,

982
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:57.680
his firsthand experience failed to support Marshall's rationale.

983
01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.980
Frazier wrote that we all have kindly impulses fostered by 2000 years of

984
01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:07.130
Christian teaching gentle Jesus and love thy neighbor.

985
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:12.650
But we have the killer instinct to the murderous impulse of the hunter.

986
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:19.690
And so the introduction of the book goes on and talks about many vets that just

987
01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:24.020
outright deny this.
And I do too.

988
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.400
And I never saw,

989
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:31.630
I never saw or felt any hesitation or saw anyone that I was with hesitate in any

990
01:01:34.611 --> 01:01:38.210
way to engage.
In fact,
quite the opposite.

991
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.300
Most guys were more than ready to get after it.

992
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:44.480
And I'm not just talking about seals,
I'm talking about army infantry men.

993
01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:45.590
I'm talking about marines.

994
01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:50.720
The guys are guys are not hesitating.

995
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:54.200
I mean broadly,
you could never make a statement like this.

996
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:56.870
Could you make a statement that some people hesitate?
Yes,

997
01:01:56.871 --> 01:01:57.860
you could make that statement.

998
01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:03.070
But to broadly say that only 15 to 25% of people aren't going to actively engage

999
01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:07.100
the enemy from everything I saw,
that's patently untrue.

1000
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.890
Now the advantage in what we had for an advantage,

1001
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:15.860
and Marshall kind of claims this too,

1002
01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:21.460
is that once World War II was over and they started training us to shoot at one

1003
01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:24.780
of the big objections he has that that guys were getting trained to shoot

1004
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:27.880
bullseye targets,
right?
So that your training,
shoot a bullseye.

1005
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:32.430
When you first see a man you're like,
oh no,
that's a man.
We,

1006
01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:37.260
my whole career,
I barely ever shot a bullseye target.

1007
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:39.990
We did that when we had to qualify with a rifle or a pistol.

1008
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:44.700
Every single other time we shot,
we were shooting a man shaped target.

1009
01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.090
I mean we would shoot little round targets or what were they called?
Head plates,

1010
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.460
right?
Of course shooting,
get heads or shooting body shots where shooting,

1011
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:55.320
that's what we do all the time and we'd shoot.

1012
01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:57.300
So we shoot targets with pictures on them,

1013
01:02:57.301 --> 01:02:59.520
with faces on them that look like people.

1014
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.300
And then on top of that we did force on force training where we're actually

1015
01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:08.301
shooting paint balls or simunition at other human beings and we're gunning him

1016
01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:09.234
down.
Yeah.

1017
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.340
So there's a lot of conditioning that we had that maybe that's why we were so

1018
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:18.600
much more apt and able and willing to shoot.
But

1019
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:20.803
<v 5>yeah.</v>

1020
01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:25.210
<v 0>Yeah.
It's um,
from,
you know,</v>

1021
01:03:25.211 --> 01:03:29.260
you can see from what these other vets said and these other leaders said and my

1022
01:03:29.261 --> 01:03:34.150
personal experience,
um,
and you'll find that I think SLA Marshall,

1023
01:03:34.151 --> 01:03:34.631
like I said,

1024
01:03:34.631 --> 01:03:39.070
I think he just had a hypothesis you wanted to talk about and threw it out there

1025
01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:40.990
without really good facts behind it.

1026
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.270
So I'm not going to waste a bunch of time talking about that and I'm going to go

1027
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:50.230
to the next chapter.
Fire is the cure.

1028
01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.530
Finally.
It is the volume of fire that counts.

1029
01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:00.880
You win if you kill more of the enemy than he can kill a view.
If you cannot,

1030
01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:05.450
you are to feed in that secretary of war.
Robert Patterson.
And again,

1031
01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:08.300
I'll go back to this fire counts for sure.
It's important,

1032
01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.420
but you got to maneuver.
It's covering move.
It's not just covering fire.

1033
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.520
It's like you got to cover and move.
That's,
that's to me,
they go hand in hand,

1034
01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.990
which actually he says
back to the book,

1035
01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:24.590
fundamentally,
fire must always be beaten by fire.
Fundamentally,

1036
01:04:24.591 --> 01:04:25.790
movement is the means.

1037
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:29.540
Increasing the efficiency of one's own fire until the last strength of the

1038
01:04:29.541 --> 01:04:34.130
enemy's fire is reduced to a vantage.
Important.
Okay.
I mean,
okay.

1039
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.800
If you want to say that you're maneuvering so that you can maneuver so you can

1040
01:04:36.801 --> 01:04:38.270
fire even better.
That's,

1041
01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:41.480
that's technically true or you're maneuvering so you can break contact,

1042
01:04:41.481 --> 01:04:44.900
but you could say that.
Yeah.

1043
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:48.080
Here's another quote.

1044
01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:52.430
Let us not think of mobility in an army general.

1045
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:54.530
Charles piece,
summer all once said,

1046
01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:58.370
unless we think of mobility accompanied by violence,

1047
01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:02.970
that's covering move this fire maneuver.
That's what we're talking about.

1048
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.273
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1049
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:13.350
<v 0>Combat can cannot ever approximate the conditions of field maneuvers.</v>

1050
01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:17.680
Fears of varying sort afflict the soldier in battle.

1051
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.480
The unit commander soon comes to realize that one of his difficulties to get men

1052
01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:27.481
to leave cover because of enemy bullets and the fear they instill in training.

1053
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.400
There being no real bullet danger.

1054
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.400
Even on the courses which employ live ammunition.

1055
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.700
Every advance under a supposed enemy fire is unrealistic to in training.

1056
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:41.950
The soldier does not have a man as his target.

1057
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:44.560
He is not shooting with the idea of killing.

1058
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:47.620
There is a third vast difference in the two conditions.

1059
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:52.210
The rifleman and training is usually under close soup observation and the chief

1060
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:55.240
pressure upon him is to give satisfaction to his superior.

1061
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:59.920
Whereas the rifleman engaging the enemy is of necessity pretty much on his own

1062
01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:04.030
and the chief pressure on him is to remain alive if possible.

1063
01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:09.280
When the infantry men mind when the infantry man's mind is gripped by fear,

1064
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.470
his body is captured by inertia,

1065
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:16.150
which is fears Siamese twin in an attack,

1066
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:21.750
half of the men on a firing line are in terror and the other half are unnerved.

1067
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:26.710
So wrote Major General JFC fuller when he was a young captain.

1068
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.350
So again,
this is what I kind of already talked about,

1069
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.570
the idea that in training you're shooting at,

1070
01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:33.610
you're not shooting with this intent to kill and we,

1071
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.850
that's what we did all the time.
I mean that's just how we rolled.
In fact,

1072
01:06:36.851 --> 01:06:40.450
they make targets where like blood comes out when you shoot and balloon blows up

1073
01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:43.030
and blood,
you see blood.
So they're trying to condition you.

1074
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:44.860
And they talk about this with video games too,
right?

1075
01:06:44.861 --> 01:06:48.610
That these young kids come up killing all the time and these video games which

1076
01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:49.091
are very,

1077
01:06:49.091 --> 01:06:54.091
very realistic and therefore they get conditioned to killing and they don't

1078
01:06:54.971 --> 01:06:56.230
think it's a big deal anymore,

1079
01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.640
which clearly that you could tie that into a school shootings.

1080
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.560
A lot of people tie that into school shootings and say,

1081
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:05.290
hey these kids were playing these video games or they're just killing people all

1082
01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:09.580
the time and that conditioned them to be able to kill these innocent people in a

1083
01:07:09.581 --> 01:07:13.570
school.
So there is,
like I said,

1084
01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:17.800
for me the all I ever shot at basically was human targets.

1085
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.000
Things that look like people.

1086
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:24.450
And again I've seen the video games that they are so realistic,

1087
01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:25.690
it's unbelievable.

1088
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.770
And so that's another good form of conditioning to get you over the,

1089
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:33.760
if you have any moral objection to killing.
Now the,

1090
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:35.830
the counter statement to that,

1091
01:07:35.831 --> 01:07:40.240
this is it good for people to get over the moral condition of killing some

1092
01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:44.200
people know if you're not a soldier.
That's probably a bad thing I would say.

1093
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:45.763
Yeah.

1094
01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.020
<v 2>Yeah.
Even though the video game thing,</v>

1095
01:07:48.021 --> 01:07:53.021
it seems like there's like a step before that to for someone to get conditioned

1096
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:56.000
to kill him because I don't know,

1097
01:07:56.030 --> 01:08:01.030
obviously my last intense video game experiences like playstation two which

1098
01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.090
seems like a long time ago,
but so yeah,
the video games a realistic,

1099
01:08:08.091 --> 01:08:13.091
but it seems like that they have to get past a certain step two consider the

1100
01:08:13.491 --> 01:08:17.650
video games as being,
so you guys,
like when you guys were,
you know,

1101
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:18.920
NC training and you know,

1102
01:08:18.921 --> 01:08:22.190
in the seal teams you guys are specifically training for that specific thing

1103
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:22.851
that was on your mind.

1104
01:08:22.851 --> 01:08:27.290
So you're past the point of the moral objection part of it.

1105
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.891
See what I'm saying?

1106
01:08:27.891 --> 01:08:31.220
So let's say you weren't passing the moral objection part of it and you were

1107
01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:32.330
just shooting,

1108
01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:34.820
whether it be video games or shooting at the range or shooting at these other

1109
01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:36.530
things.
And you were like,
oh,
hey,
I know this is,

1110
01:08:36.531 --> 01:08:39.470
I'm not training for anything specifically.
I'm just sort of doing it.

1111
01:08:39.471 --> 01:08:42.530
Whether it be for fonder to get better at shooting or or better at this game or

1112
01:08:42.531 --> 01:08:45.290
whatever.
If you're not passing the moral objection part,

1113
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:49.950
is it really training you to be less,
more,

1114
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:54.770
more Lee,
uh,
got some major issues,

1115
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.320
a school shooting,

1116
01:08:57.530 --> 01:09:00.320
and then you're sitting there playing these video games and you're killing

1117
01:09:00.321 --> 01:09:04.410
people over and over again.
It's conditioning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I mean.

1118
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:08.090
You put anyone in a,
you know,
you get someone that works in a slaughter house,

1119
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:11.510
they don't think twice about killing a pig or killing a cow or whatever.

1120
01:09:11.511 --> 01:09:14.300
That's what they do.
They don't think a millisecond about it.

1121
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.840
Whereas you take someone that's never seen an animal killed before and it'll be

1122
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:22.820
disturbing to them.
Right.
So that right there is,
their conditioning is a thing.

1123
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:26.090
Right?
Right.
And if you watch a bunch of,
you know,

1124
01:09:26.091 --> 01:09:30.770
a bunch of videos of something being killed,
you would become conditioned to it.

1125
01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.500
And if you play a game where you kill people all the time,

1126
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.140
you will become conditioned to it.

1127
01:09:35.141 --> 01:09:39.080
Now that I don't really think this is even debatable.
Yeah.
But I feel,
yeah,

1128
01:09:39.081 --> 01:09:43.070
I agree.
But I feel like there's this one kind of crucial step before that.

1129
01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:44.900
Like if you consider a slaughterhouse person,

1130
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.630
like there's a difference between working in a slaughterhouse and being

1131
01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:50.810
conditioned to the sight and the smell and the experience of doing it,

1132
01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:55.790
but not having the barrier that's like,
okay,

1133
01:09:55.791 --> 01:10:00.650
I'm going to make a decision to do this under,
you know,
a different circumstance.

1134
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.620
Something that's more and more morally tied.
Well,
yeah,
I mean,

1135
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:07.550
and let's face the fact there's millions and hundreds of millions of people that

1136
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:11.780
play video games all day long and they're not going out there and have no

1137
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:14.570
intention of going out there.
And you're,
but you,
okay.
So yeah,

1138
01:10:14.571 --> 01:10:15.404
I see what you're saying.
If,

1139
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.430
if you start thinking that way and that becomes your intent than it is

1140
01:10:19.431 --> 01:10:23.180
conditioning because you can even consider someone on the opposite where,

1141
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:26.060
let's say they're morally,
um,
what do,
what do you call it?

1142
01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:28.850
The moral barrier has been crossed in their head or they're weird.

1143
01:10:28.851 --> 01:10:30.070
They're a psychopath,
I don't know,
you know,

1144
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:34.400
in their brain and then they've never killed anyone or anything like that.

1145
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:39.740
So I heard a,
actually I read this thing on Saddam Hussein's son,

1146
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.260
something's doable.
Yup.

1147
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.920
And so the first time how they'd quote unquote conditioned them,
they'd be like,

1148
01:10:45.921 --> 01:10:50.630
Hey,
you know,
here's some prisoners.
Shoot him,
kill him.
Right.
So the first time,

1149
01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:54.730
no,
the first time,
not these kids not conditioned in this way to,
you know,

1150
01:10:54.731 --> 01:10:58.340
to have the experience of killing somebody and watch them die and whatever.

1151
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.790
So the first time they give him the gun,
the guy,
the kid shoots him up,

1152
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.440
empties the clip,
right.

1153
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.760
The kid who was past that moral barrier long time ago.

1154
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:11.090
But first time unconditioned into as far as the experience goes,

1155
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:14.190
he turns to the guard and goes,
hey,
can I have

1156
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:17.070
<v 3>another magazine to do it?
So he really liked it.</v>

1157
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:20.370
He didn't need necessarily conditioning because he was passed that more apart.

1158
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.100
See what I'm saying?
Yeah.
So yeah,

1159
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.360
it feels like there they are two separate things.

1160
01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:27.750
But once you kind of crossed that,
that initial moral barrier.
Oh yeah.

1161
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:31.560
The more conditioned you are,
the,
you know,
the more effect.
I mean,

1162
01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:32.730
I hate to use the word effect,

1163
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:37.850
but more into it you are or the less impact it'll have like on your brain or

1164
01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:41.680
whatever.
Yeah.
And again,
we would get good.

1165
01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:43.740
This is one of the things we get quoted on SLA.

1166
01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:48.570
Marshall was this stuff about how as the target's got more realistic if it

1167
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:52.250
encouraged people and made them more comfortable with shooting and killing.

1168
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:57.420
That's the point.
Um,
Dan I believe.

1169
01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:02.310
Yeah,
that's true.
It's true.
It's the way it is.
Uh,

1170
01:12:02.311 --> 01:12:06.030
going back to the book as another experiment unwilling rifleman may have,

1171
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:10.500
may be switched to heavier and more decisive one man weapons.

1172
01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:15.860
This sounds like a paradox to expect greater response to come from increased

1173
01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:17.970
responsibility.
This is good.
This is good.

1174
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:21.840
So he's saying you got a rifle in this doesn't want to shoot,
give them a bigger,

1175
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:26.550
more effective weapon.
He says,

1176
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:31.530
this sounds like a paradox to expect greater response to come from an increased

1177
01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:35.670
responsibility,
but it works.
I've seen many cases where men who had,

1178
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:40.650
who had funked it badly with a rifle responded heroically,

1179
01:12:40.651 --> 01:12:43.020
wouldn't give it a flame thrower or a bar.

1180
01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:47.580
Self pride and the ego are the touchstone of most of these remarkable

1181
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:48.443
conversions.

1182
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.080
A man may fail with the rifle because he feels anonymous and believes that

1183
01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:54.210
nothing important is being asked of him.

1184
01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.690
So that's pretty cool cause I talked about this all the time cause he had,

1185
01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:00.510
cause everyone has a rifle,
everyone's got a rifle and he's like,
okay,

1186
01:13:00.511 --> 01:13:02.640
let's not really,
I'm not really that important.

1187
01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:06.570
Then you give them like a heavy weapon or a heavy machine gun or a flame thrower

1188
01:13:06.571 --> 01:13:08.070
and all of a sudden he's like,
Oh yeah,
I'm the man.

1189
01:13:08.071 --> 01:13:09.270
I'm going to step up and make this happen.

1190
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.390
Which if I've talked about this many times on the podcast,

1191
01:13:12.391 --> 01:13:16.530
if you get someone that's not doing their job or they need to do a better job or

1192
01:13:16.531 --> 01:13:19.830
what have you,
if you can give them more responsibility,

1193
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:23.550
they have a good chance of actually stepping up and making things happen.

1194
01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.780
Rudolph the red nose reindeer.
Uh,

1195
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:29.890
I'm not familiar with what I'm familiar with Rudolph the red nose.
Okay.

1196
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:33.990
So Rudolph was the only one with the red nose and before they were like,

1197
01:13:33.991 --> 01:13:36.790
they used to tease them and all this stuff,
you know,
so he,

1198
01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:40.050
he thought he was inferior.
But when Santa was like,
hey,

1199
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:44.670
your nose is so bright,
won't you guide my slate tonight?

1200
01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:47.430
I get to guide the sleigh.
Hail.
Yes.
Steps up.
Does the job there,

1201
01:13:47.431 --> 01:13:49.710
you know what I'm saying?
Check.
Yeah.

1202
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.910
So you can edit that out if you want the same thing conceptually.

1203
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:59.070
Conceptually it's true.
All right,
next back to the book.

1204
01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.211
And last,

1205
01:14:00.211 --> 01:14:04.770
if we are to strengthen sound training principles and establish mental attitudes

1206
01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:09.540
which are essential to the understanding of the decisive importance of fire in

1207
01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:12.040
tactics,
we will be

1208
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.630
<v 0>well advised to cease talking about fire and movement as if the latter,</v>

1209
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:21.631
we're separate and apart from the former in tactical fact there and there did

1210
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:27.730
not exist an automatic and unbreakable connection between them.

1211
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:32.290
So now he's saying the same thing that I was saying earlier is fire is not more

1212
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:34.660
important.
They're the same thing.
Fire maneuver.

1213
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:37.900
Covered move have to happen together.
That's what he's saying.

1214
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.210
Fire is the key to mobility to fire is to move.

1215
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.620
So it goes on.
Now this next section,
again,

1216
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:52.650
this is great because next section is called them multiples of information.

1217
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.770
The multiples of information and what's great about this is he's no longer

1218
01:14:56.771 --> 01:14:57.604
talking about,

1219
01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.020
he's no longer talking about tactics of fire maneuver and this percentage of

1220
01:15:02.021 --> 01:15:04.270
fire and all that because he's out of his element there.

1221
01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:08.590
To be quite honest with you,
this one,
he's going to get into his element,

1222
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.900
which is,
well,
I'll go to it.

1223
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:18.050
I consider to be of utmost importance that keeping informed of our men as to

1224
01:15:18.051 --> 01:15:22.700
current situation so that each man may perform his duty with understanding of

1225
01:15:22.701 --> 01:15:26.960
its importance and that Sergeant David t bolt in a letter written from the

1226
01:15:26.961 --> 01:15:31.090
African theater,
so you gotta keep your people informed.

1227
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:36.960
Having started to call this chapter communications,

1228
01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.420
I decided against it for fear.

1229
01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:44.250
That use of that rather formidable word might interfere with my communicating to

1230
01:15:44.251 --> 01:15:49.170
the reader what I regard as a vital but frequently overlooked principle of minor

1231
01:15:49.171 --> 01:15:53.040
tactics.
If a word comes to mean too many things,

1232
01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:57.660
it frequently mrs fire at the critical point that has been the fate of the word

1233
01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:02.130
communications at his become another military catchall.

1234
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.200
And because it means so many things,

1235
01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:08.700
it is quite frequently means nothing to illustrate.

1236
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:13.380
A regimental commander asks the company commander,
how were your communications?

1237
01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:14.910
And the latter replies,

1238
01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:19.080
excellent because it's telephone line is working and is supply is coming forward

1239
01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:24.360
and at the same time he is at the point of despair because he hasn't had

1240
01:16:24.361 --> 01:16:29.340
anything worthwhile,
any worthwhile intelligence from his flanks for hours.

1241
01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:33.900
So there's a difference between communication like I can talk to you and actual

1242
01:16:33.901 --> 01:16:35.670
communication.
You're telling you what I need to know.

1243
01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.760
One would think that it would become almost second nature to the commander to

1244
01:16:41.761 --> 01:16:44.160
reach eagerly toward supporting forces.

1245
01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.480
One would imagine that when ever on the field of battle he made contact with a

1246
01:16:48.481 --> 01:16:49.261
friendly element.

1247
01:16:49.261 --> 01:16:52.950
That fact would flash a red light and his brain causing him automatically to

1248
01:16:52.951 --> 01:16:55.920
raise the question,
have I established full communications?

1249
01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:58.980
Do I know the strength and intentions of the force now helping me?

1250
01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:01.530
Do they know my strength and intentions,

1251
01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.380
but indeed such is not the case.

1252
01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:07.470
<v 5>Communications</v>

1253
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:15.370
<v 0>information is the soul of morale and combat and the balancing force in</v>

1254
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:17.750
successful tactics.

1255
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:22.910
And now he talks a little bit about communication and gives some guidelines

1256
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:26.090
about them and and what the problems are.

1257
01:17:26.091 --> 01:17:28.910
So information is super important to hear some of the problems.
One,

1258
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:30.260
there is a lacking.

1259
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:35.830
There is lacking a general recognition of the supreme importance of the lateral

1260
01:17:36.021 --> 01:17:41.021
flow of information to command at the lower levels is too often neglectful of

1261
01:17:42.411 --> 01:17:46.310
the principle that it is not a channel of information only,

1262
01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:50.300
but a distribution point.
So you've got to pass the word.

1263
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:55.220
Three commanders at the lower levels tend to be arbitrary judges of what

1264
01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:59.960
information deriving from a source lower would be highly useful to the other

1265
01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:03.620
elements lower down instead of abiding by the rule.
When in doubt,

1266
01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:08.090
pass it along.
So when in doubt pass along.

1267
01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:12.530
Now I do have to throw out that there can be a dicot.

1268
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.050
There's a dichotomy there because you can communicate things too much.

1269
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:18.170
You can send too many emails,
you can send too many messages,
you can do that,

1270
01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:23.060
that can be a problem.
And he actually talks about that dichotomy a little bit.

1271
01:18:23.061 --> 01:18:24.980
So he's just talking about how much you should communicate.

1272
01:18:24.981 --> 01:18:28.640
And then he gets to this point back to the book in the Pacific Fighting,

1273
01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:32.480
I found company commanders joining a platoon in the line just to isolate

1274
01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.220
themselves from their telephones.

1275
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:39.500
They were literally tired to death of having the battalion commander insist on

1276
01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:43.820
having a fresh progress report every 15 or 20 minutes and the battalion

1277
01:18:43.821 --> 01:18:44.450
commander,

1278
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:49.250
poor devil was only passing on the pressure which he had in turn receive from a

1279
01:18:49.251 --> 01:18:52.040
regimental commander who is trying to placate division

1280
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:57.520
yet one would observe that unless a battalion commander is wholly lacking in

1281
01:18:57.521 --> 01:18:59.500
judgment or intestinal fortitude,

1282
01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:04.710
he should be strong enough to take this on his aching back and not pass it down

1283
01:19:05.381 --> 01:19:08.500
to the headquarters,
which is at grips with the enemy.

1284
01:19:09.190 --> 01:19:11.920
This happens all the time in the military for sure.

1285
01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:15.460
The senior commanders going,
I want to know what's going on,

1286
01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:17.860
and it tells that to the next junior guy.
He says,
all right,

1287
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.400
I'll find out what's going on then that guys is,
I'll find out what's going on.

1288
01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.530
And the people in the front line,

1289
01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:26.200
they can't even fight cause they're too busy trying to answer the damn questions

1290
01:19:26.201 --> 01:19:28.060
from up the chain of command.
So don't let that happen.

1291
01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:35.380
Back to the book in the burden island fight during the invasion of the marshals,

1292
01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.670
one of these prodding demands for more progress raced from division right

1293
01:19:39.671 --> 01:19:43.750
through lower headquarters to a platoon which had been stopped cold by Jap fire

1294
01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.830
coming from spider holes arranged in great depth along the beach.

1295
01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:51.670
The lieutenant got the message and crawling forward to them.

1296
01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.060
His most advanced rifleman told them to get up and go on.

1297
01:19:56.410 --> 01:20:00.370
The boy screamed.
So the whole God damn army wants me to,
wants to kill me.

1298
01:20:00.371 --> 01:20:04.330
Does it?
Okay Lieutenant,
here I go.
But watch what happens.

1299
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.010
He was shot almost before

1300
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.440
<v 5>he had gotten out of his tracks.
Okay.</v>

1301
01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:14.300
<v 0>That incident see are deep into the brain of every man who witnessed it.</v>

1302
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:19.040
It was final judgment on the futility of that kind of leading

1303
01:20:21.970 --> 01:20:23.770
decentralized command.
Who's going to make a better call,

1304
01:20:23.771 --> 01:20:27.250
somebody back in the rear or this lieutenant that's there on the beach

1305
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.991
back to the book.

1306
01:20:30.991 --> 01:20:35.991
The all too frequent consequences of such pressure are lining exaggeration and

1307
01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:41.190
distortion of the situation at lower levels resulting in a false concept of the

1308
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:42.570
situation.
At the higher,

1309
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:46.950
the average company commander can stand only a limited amount of this heat and

1310
01:20:46.951 --> 01:20:51.380
then he will knock over a couple of outhouses and report that he has captured of

1311
01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:55.680
village.
It also,

1312
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:59.970
this effect also makes a wishful thinker of the most objective shold soldier.

1313
01:21:00.170 --> 01:21:04.020
He re he reasons to himself.
I'll have that position and another hour,

1314
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.230
so I'll tell him that I have it now and get them off my back.

1315
01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:12.450
<v 5>Okay,</v>

1316
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:16.080
<v 0>so lots about communication being important.</v>

1317
01:21:16.081 --> 01:21:18.330
Next is the riddle of command.

1318
01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:23.410
Many headquarters people become strangers to the front and cannot speak its

1319
01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:26.140
language or understand it's tribulations.
Okay?

1320
01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:29.350
You don't know what's going on in the front lines if you don't have any idea.

1321
01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:31.840
If you can't even speak their language anymore,
you need to get down there.

1322
01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:34.810
You need to find out what's going on in the front lines.
Businesses.

1323
01:21:34.811 --> 01:21:35.740
That means you too.

1324
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:43.500
The diabolical effect of even such a relatively simple instrument as the field

1325
01:21:43.601 --> 01:21:48.601
telephone is that it may come to command the commander,

1326
01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:53.980
the phone actually gets control of view a chained him to a system of remote

1327
01:21:53.981 --> 01:21:58.300
control.
At first he sees it only as a successful as it useful channel for quick

1328
01:21:58.301 --> 01:21:59.470
communication in combat.

1329
01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:03.940
Then he fears to leave at lest it should require his presence in headquarters

1330
01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.490
the moment after he leaves to go forward.

1331
01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.220
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1332
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.450
<v 0>This state of mind in turn creates its own illusion.
Fostering that,</v>

1333
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:17.490
fostering the conclusion that under the new system of war all matters can be

1334
01:22:17.491 --> 01:22:18.810
settled at a distance.

1335
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:23.340
All problems arising within the zone of fire can be fully understood without

1336
01:22:23.341 --> 01:22:25.770
ever going there and all moral values,

1337
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:29.310
which ones attended the commanders effort to impress his men with his

1338
01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:34.311
personality and character are somehow sundered by the new technology of

1339
01:22:34.501 --> 01:22:35.460
operations.

1340
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:37.220
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1341
01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:42.220
<v 0>Sedentary General Ship Arises Evil of troops which while bang mechanically have</v>

1342
01:22:43.401 --> 01:22:47.930
no organic thinking response to the commander as well.
So,
I mean,
how,

1343
01:22:47.931 --> 01:22:51.450
how poignant is this for,
it's what we live in today,
right?

1344
01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:54.560
Everyone thinks they can just send a text message and the problem solved.

1345
01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.630
Just make a quick phone call and the problem solved.

1346
01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.810
And actually the reality is sometimes you need to get down there.
Yeah.

1347
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:06.130
Also the whole thing about it controlling you,
you know,
do you forget

1348
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.570
<v 3>your phone?
Do you have that at all?</v>

1349
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:12.070
Like when you leave your phone at home or in the car or something like that

1350
01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:15.070
where you don't have it for like know,
I don't forget things a lot.

1351
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:19.150
That doesn't really happen to me a lot.
Um,
but yeah,

1352
01:23:19.151 --> 01:23:23.030
I would say if I left my phone somewhere I would be like,
Oh Dang,
I wonder,

1353
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.630
I'm just trying to call me right now.
I wonder if there's an emergency going on.

1354
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:31.930
But you know,
back in the day when were,
you know,
whatever teenagers or whatever,

1355
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.500
oh,
presale phones,
presale,
teenage pre,
pre cell phone.

1356
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:40.360
I was writing on the deal.
There was no,
there was no internet.

1357
01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:44.260
I was telling my kids the other day that when I was a kid there was no internet

1358
01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:47.800
that did.
It was not a thing.
It's like saying there is no roads.

1359
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.320
It's the same thing for my kids.
They're like,
what?
They were looking at me like,

1360
01:23:52.321 --> 01:23:53.154
what?
What did she,

1361
01:23:55.490 --> 01:24:00.370
how did you not just because you had to go to the library to look something up,

1362
01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:01.990
get an encyclopedia.

1363
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:07.060
I remember thinking encyclopedias were more or like holy,

1364
01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.520
you know what I mean?
There were so many dictionaries.

1365
01:24:09.521 --> 01:24:14.380
I thought that was like up like a holy book all filled with,
my mom had a,

1366
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.760
had a,
had an OED Oxford English dictionary,
not the full,

1367
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:20.020
the full one is a follow Hume's.

1368
01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:22.600
The phone was 26 volumes or something crazy like that,

1369
01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:26.160
but my mom had one that was big.
I mean it was big.

1370
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.460
It was six inches thick.
Yeah,
it was like six,

1371
01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:34.540
maybe six inches thick and big and it had the little tabs.

1372
01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:36.560
Little indentations from,
yeah,
your fingers.

1373
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:41.650
But I to me that things seemed like some kind of Bible,

1374
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:46.420
like some kind of just seems so filled with knowledge and if you didn't know

1375
01:24:46.421 --> 01:24:49.120
what a word was,
you just had to go look it up in that thing.

1376
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.200
You didn't know what a thing was.
You look it up in the encyclopedia,

1377
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.010
go to the library and look it up in the encyclopedias.

1378
01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:57.490
Nowadays you're three seconds away.
You got that Google.

1379
01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:02.650
Yeah you want to look in the dictionary,
dictionary.com boom.
Need those fingers.

1380
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.120
Unless you got that through the APP.

1381
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:09.070
Oh the apple and even better cause you got to want to get that etymology of the

1382
01:25:09.071 --> 01:25:12.830
word to you.
I don't know where it comes from.
That stuff.
Then you got what's the,

1383
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.150
the street language won't.
What does Ellen?

1384
01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:20.120
Well in the urban dictionary Nixon,
it's kind of fun balance.

1385
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:21.850
Here's the thing,
it's weird.

1386
01:25:21.851 --> 01:25:25.530
It's like it is fun and it's funny but it's very useful cause you don't want

1387
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:27.770
people,
they'll say stuff and you'd be like,
wait,
wait,
wait.

1388
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.460
You have to look some things up on urban dictionary and a couple of times,

1389
01:25:30.461 --> 01:25:32.410
I'm trying to think of a good example right now,

1390
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.210
but I can't think of one next time I will.
I will.
I will note that it,

1391
01:25:37.211 --> 01:25:41.340
cause you know I got teenage kids so sometimes they got some words.
Yeah.

1392
01:25:41.341 --> 01:25:42.120
You got to know that.

1393
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.700
Like we're saying something a couple of years ago Hifi remember?
No,

1394
01:25:45.701 --> 01:25:49.690
I don't remember that.
Well that's not,
oh that's new.
Hifi.
What does it mean?

1395
01:25:50.690 --> 01:25:54.550
Well,
I don't know if I can define it specifically,

1396
01:25:54.551 --> 01:25:58.360
but it means like get fired up dope.
Oh,
okay.

1397
01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:04.100
Hifi 50 cent or somebody,
I don't know.
Anyway,
but yeah,

1398
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.760
<v 2>but yeah,
but that's the thing though.
You,
you lose or you forget your cell phone,</v>

1399
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:09.420
you go to the store,
I dunno,

1400
01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:13.670
you're going to Vons and you'd leave by accident and whatever your phone at
home,

1401
01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.390
it's like,
oh yeah.
And just like how you said,
you got those thoughts like,
oh,

1402
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:19.760
what if there's an emergency?
What if someone's calling me kind of thing.

1403
01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:22.620
All you gotta do is splash calls.
Yeah.

1404
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:26.780
Or this is the one day that there's like anywhere to nuts to say that you can't

1405
01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:27.980
have an emergency.
He's totally can,

1406
01:26:27.981 --> 01:26:32.981
but it's like literally the 99.9999999% of the time you have access to that

1407
01:26:35.241 --> 01:26:39.170
phone.
That one teeny,
teeny tiny sliver of time that you don't,
oh no.

1408
01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:40.670
All the emergency is going to come.
See what I'm saying.

1409
01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.440
And you think back to when you,
when there was no cell phones,
it's like,
oh,

1410
01:26:44.441 --> 01:26:47.090
did you ever get along?
No,
I'm doing that right now.

1411
01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:51.110
I'm going with my without my cell phone.
But everyone around.

1412
01:26:51.111 --> 01:26:51.944
Here's the thing though,

1413
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:56.900
with that everyone around you kind of feels the same thing.
So like for example,

1414
01:26:56.901 --> 01:26:59.210
if you go to the store,
all right,
if I go to the store,

1415
01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:03.770
people know I go to the store or people know I went to store.
My wife knows,

1416
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:06.560
you know,
maybe if I'm like hanging out with friends very,

1417
01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:10.100
I'm going to start a real quick,
right?
We're having a barbecue.
I don't know.

1418
01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:15.080
They expect me to have my phone and I expect to have a phone.

1419
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:17.120
So it's like that communication now communication,

1420
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:21.650
the standard of communication is way higher now seem saying like your access to

1421
01:27:21.651 --> 01:27:25.460
someone else's.
I'll tell you one thing that is a kind of a bummer.
And I,

1422
01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.200
you know,

1423
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:32.030
for a long time I responded to like everybody that reached out to me and,

1424
01:27:32.031 --> 01:27:36.230
and I just can't,
I mean I can't do it.
I just,
it's physical.

1425
01:27:36.231 --> 01:27:39.950
I would be doing nothing but sitting around doing that and it's really cool man.

1426
01:27:39.951 --> 01:27:44.951
I get letters and emails and Facebook and dms on,

1427
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.660
you know,
and I just don't have time and I feel bad.
You know,

1428
01:27:50.661 --> 01:27:55.520
I read most everything but it's been getting crazy.

1429
01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:56.690
And here's the thing,

1430
01:27:56.691 --> 01:28:00.950
and I think this is important to understand overall for kind of,
for you,

1431
01:28:00.951 --> 01:28:03.860
for sure,
for everyone,
when someone,

1432
01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:06.790
you know how like someone will text you or someone will send you a,

1433
01:28:06.791 --> 01:28:11.780
like a message,
like a long message and some,
it's easy to think like,
hey,

1434
01:28:11.781 --> 01:28:15.470
you could have responded with like just something rather than nothing.

1435
01:28:15.471 --> 01:28:16.304
But here's the thing.

1436
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:20.330
That's not true because if someone sends you a text message or especially

1437
01:28:20.331 --> 01:28:23.880
something long and meaningful,
like you don't want to just reply back with,

1438
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:27.940
okay or okay,
I'll text you later more about this message.

1439
01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:29.450
That makes me less sense.

1440
01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.140
You want to have something kind of thought out so it's not just a small little

1441
01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:37.820
response or you who doesn't have time to send one text.
Well the thing is,

1442
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.920
yeah,
physically sending the texts,

1443
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:44.900
it doesn't take any time but to consider you're a a valid or appropriate

1444
01:28:44.901 --> 01:28:47.140
response to most texts and men,

1445
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:50.480
especially in your case where you getting messages,
legit messages.

1446
01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:54.530
You can't just be like,
cool and then move on to the next day.
You can't do that.

1447
01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:58.430
So you got to consider all these things and then all that consideration.

1448
01:28:58.431 --> 01:29:02.040
That's what takes the time and mental energy by the way.
Like,
like,

1449
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.780
like you can't go in one direction mentally and just pivot real quick and be

1450
01:29:06.781 --> 01:29:09.930
like,
yeah,
let me just mentally accommodate this.
You know,
it's like,
man,

1451
01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:13.230
it takes more thought than that.
So it's hard to fit it all in.
Especially for,

1452
01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:13.620
you know,

1453
01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:17.610
<v 0>it is,
man,
I feel bad when I can't get back to people,</v>

1454
01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:23.120
but I appreciate them reaching out and letting me know that they're getting good

1455
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:30.120
information.
Right.
Yeah.
Whether it's work related,
whether it's individual,

1456
01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:32.460
personal related,
their kids,
whatever,
warrior king,

1457
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:36.990
I mean all kinds of good stuff.
And I'm so stoked.
But like you said,
it's like

1458
01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.140
I can't literally just cannot see.
You just tried.
Yeah,

1459
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:49.320
I tried.
So I posted today,
I was like,
hey,
it's Monday.

1460
01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.340
Sometimes life gets up her hand and you've got to go,
you've got to attack.

1461
01:29:54.210 --> 01:29:55.980
And that's why I was feeling this weekend.
I was like,

1462
01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.080
cause I've been on the road.
We went to Maine,

1463
01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.500
didn't get a lot of work done a main cause we were working in Maine,

1464
01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:05.270
we were rolling and then we were working in recording podcasts and interviewing

1465
01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.270
and all this other stuff.
So didn't have a lot of time up there,

1466
01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.430
got a little bit behind life,
got the upper hand on me.

1467
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.030
And so I was kind of feeling it on when I got home.

1468
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:19.650
And then when I said it was,
oh,
you know what I'm going to do so Sunday I just,

1469
01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.070
I'm just going to work all day.
Just get you,
just get busy.

1470
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.020
Because people were talking to me about the kids podcast.
Yeah.

1471
01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:32.090
Podcast.
Yeah.
Where's the other guy?
You know?
Hey Gang,

1472
01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:34.500
my kids love listening to it when listening to it for them.

1473
01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:37.530
We're listening to the first 16 episodes for the ninth time now.

1474
01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:42.930
Can you make another one or are you given up on that?
I'm like,
Whoa,

1475
01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:47.850
those are straight up.
So,
so I got after that,
recorded some of that today.

1476
01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:50.510
But,
but that's what I did go on the attack,
like,

1477
01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:54.870
and that really does it really like by the end,
by,
by the end of Sunday,

1478
01:30:54.871 --> 01:30:56.250
I was like,
oh my God.
And I thought,

1479
01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:59.460
I thought it's was gonna be late night on Sunday.
I thought midnight,
which,

1480
01:30:59.510 --> 01:31:01.980
you know,
I don't want to go to bed at midnight on a Sunday night.

1481
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:05.940
I got to got done,
it's like nine 45 at night.
And I was like,
oh.

1482
01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:12.390
And I was ahead.
I was back ahead that I had to get aggressive.
I had to dig deep.

1483
01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:14.700
I had to go like,
okay,
this is what's going on.

1484
01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.710
So if you start feeling that little life's getting the upper hand,
if you,

1485
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:23.920
if you let it continue to maneuver on you,
it's going to get worse.
If you go,
oh,

1486
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.070
oh,
you think you're gonna get the upper hand,
watch this,

1487
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.120
I'm going to get aggressive.

1488
01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:30.330
I'm gonna knock out so much stuff in the next 24 hours.

1489
01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:32.460
You're not even know what just happened,
son.

1490
01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:37.080
So that's how I went at it as is actually,
I made the video on Monday.

1491
01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:40.520
Technically it was a Sunday evolution,
but by the time Monday rolled around,

1492
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:41.420
I was back in the game.

1493
01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:45.910
<v 2>That's true.
Like if you get the,
or some some one else,</v>

1494
01:31:45.911 --> 01:31:50.530
something else gets the upper hand.
It's like Dang,
you got to work double time.

1495
01:31:50.690 --> 01:31:53.650
Just slowly.
It doesn't have the apprehended anymore.
Once you get the upper hand,

1496
01:31:53.651 --> 01:31:56.140
okay,
yeah,
you can boom you.
Can you find your read though,
by the

1497
01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:58.240
<v 0>way,
when you,
when you get the upper hand,</v>

1498
01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.860
it's like when you're playing a sport and the team starts to get the little

1499
01:32:02.861 --> 01:32:05.650
upper hand and then they just,
they can start taking a little bit more risks.

1500
01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:09.520
They get a little bit more confident.
Yeah.
And they get the more match.
Yeah.

1501
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:12.860
They get the momentum and they start going and that's productive,
right?

1502
01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:15.910
That they widen that scored,
run up the score.
Boy.

1503
01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:21.550
And so that's same thing I'm thinking.
But I had me on the ropes a little bit.

1504
01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:25.120
You know,
it was on the ropes.
I was on the ropes over here and I had to,

1505
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:29.320
I had to get it.
I woke up early and I was just boom,

1506
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:33.010
I'm gonna Start Hammering.
And that's what you gotta do.
Finished reading a book,

1507
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.970
wrote another book,
edited a book.
I had a stack of stuff.

1508
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:42.790
Come and get some,
be aggressive.
Oh,

1509
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:45.310
okay.
So the communication.
Thanks.

1510
01:32:45.311 --> 01:32:47.980
So here's the other thing that happens with modern communications.

1511
01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.890
Text messaging,
emails.

1512
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:54.940
You started losing that little personal touch,
which is important.

1513
01:32:54.941 --> 01:32:57.700
Here we go back to the book with is characteristically warm humor.

1514
01:32:57.701 --> 01:33:02.590
General Eisenhower W has commented on the value of the personal factor in the

1515
01:33:02.591 --> 01:33:06.190
commander's relation to his men under the conditions of modern war.

1516
01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:11.200
I found that it did a great deal of good to get down to my troops in the combat

1517
01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:12.063
area.

1518
01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:17.230
My presence relaxed them and made them feel more comfortable about the
situation,

1519
01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.820
but I was not deceived as to the reason I knew what was running through their

1520
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:26.410
minds.
They were saying to themselves,
there must be less danger than we thought,

1521
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:31.540
or the old man wouldn't be here.
Yeah,
get down.

1522
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:33.940
Talk to the troops here.

1523
01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:37.210
We talk about this as a part of the nature of the combat soldier.

1524
01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:41.620
Once he loses that faith,
it becomes a very difficult to resolve it.

1525
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:43.390
He will lose it very quickly.

1526
01:33:43.391 --> 01:33:48.391
When he sees that casualties are wasted on useless operations or when he begins

1527
01:33:48.491 --> 01:33:53.380
to feel that he is in any respect of the victim of bad planning or faulty

1528
01:33:53.381 --> 01:33:57.820
concepts,
that's important.

1529
01:33:59.770 --> 01:34:02.680
Then he responds to that principle,

1530
01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:08.100
which was once well stated by General James hardboard discipline and moral

1531
01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:09.730
influence,

1532
01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:15.840
the inarticulate vote that is constantly taken by masses of men when the order

1533
01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:19.630
to comes to move forward.
When the order comes to move forward,

1534
01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:24.670
a variant of the crowd psychology that inclines it to follow a leader,

1535
01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:28.660
but the army does not move forward until the motion is carried.

1536
01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:33.900
Unanimous consent only falls cooperation between the invent individual men in

1537
01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:38.770
ranks.
That's a bold statement like,
hey,
you can give that order,

1538
01:34:38.771 --> 01:34:42.610
but until everybody kind of knows that it's a good plan,
we're not going.

1539
01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:51.230
Here's another good statement.
By rough approximation,

1540
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:56.290
60% of the art of command is the ability to anticipate 40% of the Arctic command

1541
01:34:56.841 --> 01:34:58.760
is ability to improvise,

1542
01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:04.350
to reject the preconceived idea that has been tested and proved wrong in the

1543
01:35:04.351 --> 01:35:09.351
crucible of operations and to rule by action instead of acting by rules.

1544
01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:11.893
<v 5>That's a good one,</v>

1545
01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:16.800
<v 0>by the way.
That's the entire Arctic command,
right?
That's,</v>

1546
01:35:16.801 --> 01:35:21.290
that's 100% anticipation and ability to improvise.

1547
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:25.430
Obviously there's some more factors in there,
but those are some important ones.

1548
01:35:25.530 --> 01:35:27.680
Yes,
there's,
and I don't think I pulled it out,

1549
01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:30.980
but there's also one part in the book where it says anticipation is important,

1550
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:36.050
but it's,
but it's,
you can't just say somewhat,
hey,
anticipate harder,

1551
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:40.280
like anticipate more.
It's hard to say to that someone,

1552
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:43.670
someone's got to have experience,
someone's got to have the mindset for it.

1553
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:44.211
They've got an old,

1554
01:35:44.211 --> 01:35:47.870
they've got a free their mind and open their minds and that they can be aware of

1555
01:35:47.871 --> 01:35:51.710
little nuances that are happening and changes that are occurring.

1556
01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:54.710
It can't be down in the weeds or else you can't anticipate anything because

1557
01:35:54.711 --> 01:35:58.150
you're getting knocked around and the in the dust and the dirt.
Yeah,

1558
01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:01.500
so it's kind of like a pay attention kind of thing.
Like it's a,

1559
01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.460
it's a way of paying attention.

1560
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:08.780
I think really the key is detachment because if you can't detach,

1561
01:36:08.781 --> 01:36:10.970
you're not going to be able to anticipate anything cause you're in.

1562
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.610
And that's why there's the obvious dichotomy here.
Yeah.

1563
01:36:13.611 --> 01:36:15.530
Do you want to go down and be with the troops?
Absolutely.

1564
01:36:15.531 --> 01:36:17.930
But can you go down and be with troops so much that you lose track of what's

1565
01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:21.110
happening at a strategic level and you can anticipate what's happening?
No,

1566
01:36:21.111 --> 01:36:23.660
you can't do that dichotomy of leadership.
You've got to balance it.

1567
01:36:24.250 --> 01:36:25.083
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1568
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.590
<v 0>Back to the book during war,</v>

1569
01:36:27.591 --> 01:36:31.790
it oftentime happens that one company by trial and error finds the true solution

1570
01:36:31.791 --> 01:36:34.160
for some acute problem which concerns everyone.

1571
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:35.300
<v 5>Okay,</v>

1572
01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:36.980
<v 0>but when that happens to a company,</v>

1573
01:36:36.981 --> 01:36:40.280
I can assure you that is the exceptional company officer who takes the

1574
01:36:40.281 --> 01:36:41.420
initiative and passes.
It,

1575
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:45.860
passes his unique solution along to his superiors even after he has proved and

1576
01:36:45.861 --> 01:36:47.120
battle that the idea works.

1577
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:51.650
A good company idea in tactics is likely to remain confined to one company

1578
01:36:51.690 --> 01:36:52.550
indefinitely,

1579
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:56.420
even though it would be a benefit to the whole military of stop establishment.

1580
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:59.300
And this is what this is just dealing with silos.
It happens in the military,

1581
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:00.890
it happens in the civilian sector.

1582
01:37:00.891 --> 01:37:02.960
Somebody figures something out and they keep it to themselves.

1583
01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.200
The fundamental purpose of all training today should be to develop the natural

1584
01:37:09.201 --> 01:37:14.201
phys ed faculties and to stimulate the brain of the soldier rather than to treat

1585
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:19.460
him as a cog which has been fitted into a great machine.

1586
01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.160
<v 5>Got to keep pointing that out.</v>

1587
01:37:26.730 --> 01:37:31.730
<v 0>Loyalty in the masses of men wax is strong in the degree that they are made to</v>

1588
01:37:32.671 --> 01:37:37.671
believe that real importance is attached to their work and to their ability to

1589
01:37:38.221 --> 01:37:39.480
think about their work.

1590
01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:42.783
<v 5>So</v>

1591
01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:47.430
<v 0>you got to get people engaged and can people gotta understand and believe that</v>

1592
01:37:47.431 --> 01:37:50.000
what they're doing is important and they got to have some kind of say they got

1593
01:37:50.001 --> 01:37:52.050
to have some control over their own fate.

1594
01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.750
It weekends at every point where they consider that there is a negative respect

1595
01:37:57.751 --> 01:37:58.860
for their intelligence.

1596
01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:04.440
This rule applies whether a man is engaged in digging a ditch or in working up a

1597
01:38:04.441 --> 01:38:06.090
loading table for an invasion.

1598
01:38:08.770 --> 01:38:11.800
So if you have negative respect for people's intelligence that I'm not going to

1599
01:38:11.801 --> 01:38:12.634
do a good job,

1600
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.900
big chunk,

1601
01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.380
a little bit of a big chunk here to square training with the reality of war.

1602
01:38:20.410 --> 01:38:24.250
It becomes a necessary part of the young officers' mental equipment for training

1603
01:38:24.251 --> 01:38:29.110
to instill in him the full realization that in combat many things can and will

1604
01:38:29.111 --> 01:38:32.770
go wrong without it being anyone's fault in particular.

1605
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.520
So what did I just say?
Things are going to happen is no one's fault.

1606
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:42.810
Does that really?
Does that really marry up with the idea of extreme ownership?

1607
01:38:42.811 --> 01:38:46.200
Well not really Greg,
cause I'm taking ownership of anything.
However,

1608
01:38:46.201 --> 01:38:50.160
keep listening.
War is aimed at destruction.

1609
01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:54.840
The fire and general purpose of the enemy are directed against one's own

1610
01:38:54.841 --> 01:38:59.700
personnel materiel and communications with the object of keeping one's own

1611
01:38:59.701 --> 01:39:01.350
design from coming into play.

1612
01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:07.110
Small plans miscarry because the wrong man happens to be hit at the critical

1613
01:39:07.111 --> 01:39:10.590
moment or the guns which were counted on are knocked out of action.

1614
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:16.340
The problem of command in battle is ever to establish a safe margin which will

1615
01:39:17.401 --> 01:39:20.820
allow for such misadventure.
There you go.

1616
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:24.900
So things are gonna go wrong,
but what you have to take ownership of is,

1617
01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:29.760
is figuring out how you're going to have a plan that's going to overcome those

1618
01:39:29.761 --> 01:39:33.810
problems
back to the book.
But this much is certain.

1619
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:36.660
There is no system of safeguards known to man,

1620
01:39:36.661 --> 01:39:41.190
which can fully eliminate the consequences of accident and ms chance in battle.

1621
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:46.310
Hence the only final protection is the resiliency and courage of the commander

1622
01:39:46.621 --> 01:39:51.210
and his subordinates.
So what does that mean?
When something goes wrong,

1623
01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:54.030
when something bad happens,
you adapt,
you adjust,

1624
01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:58.040
you alter your plans and you continue forward,
you own it.

1625
01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:04.680
It therefore follows that the far object of a training system is to prepare the

1626
01:40:04.681 --> 01:40:09.681
combat officer mentally so that he can cope with the unusual and the unexpected

1627
01:40:09.991 --> 01:40:14.991
as if it were the altogether normal and give him poise in a situation where all

1628
01:40:16.321 --> 01:40:20.010
else is in dis equilibrium.

1629
01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.533
<v 1>Yup.</v>

1630
01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:25.280
<v 0>I'm saying over and over again.
And how do you do that?</v>

1631
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:28.010
How do you do that in the civilian sector,
right?
Prepare your people.

1632
01:40:28.011 --> 01:40:30.410
You role play with people.
You give them hard problems,

1633
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:32.030
you make them figure things out.

1634
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:36.290
You put them in tough situations so that they become accustomed to it,

1635
01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.130
but how to do it.
I would say that the beginning lies in a system of schooling,

1636
01:40:43.131 --> 01:40:47.240
which puts the emphasis on teaching soldiers how to think rather than what to

1637
01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:48.074
think.

1638
01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:52.130
Even though such a revolutionary idea would put the army somewhat ahead of our

1639
01:40:52.131 --> 01:40:53.270
civilian education.

1640
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:59.020
That's a common thing that gets said in military training is teaching people how

1641
01:40:59.021 --> 01:41:00.490
to think,
not what to think,

1642
01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:04.551
and this is a good,

1643
01:41:04.551 --> 01:41:09.050
the test of fitness of command is the ability to think clearly in the face of

1644
01:41:09.051 --> 01:41:11.390
unexpected contingency or opportunity.

1645
01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:15.740
Improvisation is the essence of initiative in all combat,

1646
01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:19.760
just as initiative as the outward showing of the power of decision.

1647
01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:24.110
Think about this when you're raising your kids too.

1648
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:26.120
There's a good little something to think about.

1649
01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:29.170
You want your kids to be able to think,
hmm,

1650
01:41:30.690 --> 01:41:34.430
think that's what,
that's why you got to have him doing some creative stuff.
Yeah,

1651
01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:36.740
right?
Sure.
Jiu Jitsu is creative,
but you got to,

1652
01:41:36.741 --> 01:41:38.970
I got to throw some other stuff at,
you mean

1653
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:44.940
back to the book of the Darkest Hour?

1654
01:41:44.941 --> 01:41:49.650
For the novice and war comes with the recoil after the unit has been have badly

1655
01:41:49.651 --> 01:41:50.484
hit.

1656
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:54.990
It is then that the young commander has greatest need of the friendship and

1657
01:41:54.991 --> 01:41:59.991
steadiness of his superior or have any other officer whose judgment he respects.

1658
01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.750
Criticism or tactical council are of no value at this time.

1659
01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.390
They can be given that later if necessary,

1660
01:42:07.570 --> 01:42:09.790
but in the wrong hour they add to the hurt.

1661
01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:14.260
Let him get out his crying towel.

1662
01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:15.670
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1663
01:42:15.670 --> 01:42:17.130
<v 0>When he is told how it happened to,</v>

1664
01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:21.100
the important thing is that he be given a pat on the back and insurance and

1665
01:42:21.101 --> 01:42:25.300
assurance that he did his full duty and some little reminder that while he may

1666
01:42:25.301 --> 01:42:27.550
feel that his losses are excessive,

1667
01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:32.110
such incidents are unavoidable feature of combat and do not keep one from coming

1668
01:42:32.111 --> 01:42:37.111
back in the next round in secret in Siegfried Saskatoon's memories of an

1669
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:38.980
infantry men,

1670
01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.990
the young lieutenant tells of emerging from a bloody trench raid and meeting his

1671
01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:44.824
colonel.

1672
01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:46.020
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1673
01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:50.640
<v 0>this was Kent Colonel King Jack I'd never met before and it was the first time I</v>

1674
01:42:50.641 --> 01:42:53.250
had ever shared any human equality with him.

1675
01:42:54.090 --> 01:42:58.980
He spoke kindly to me and his rough way and in doing so he made me very thankful

1676
01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:00.870
that I had done what I could.

1677
01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:04.780
So I mean this is a very important,

1678
01:43:04.781 --> 01:43:09.210
especially for folks that are in the military or in services where you can take

1679
01:43:09.211 --> 01:43:12.690
losses and that is when you're in charge,

1680
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:17.010
it's the time he is not then to provide tactical council,

1681
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:17.910
right?

1682
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:22.500
That's not the time first you got to let the person get over the emotional hump,

1683
01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.280
help them through that and if you've got to go back and debrief from later,

1684
01:43:26.281 --> 01:43:30.990
that's what you do
think.
I think everybody needs to pay attention to that.

1685
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:34.380
And I mean you could say the same thing for businesses.

1686
01:43:34.381 --> 01:43:37.380
You know if somebody makes a big mistake and they feel bad about it and it hurts

1687
01:43:37.381 --> 01:43:40.170
them or they get people fired and they cost a bunch of money or something like

1688
01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.230
you might not want to jump on their back immediately.

1689
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:50.220
A man remains a man after he puts on a soldier suit.

1690
01:43:50.730 --> 01:43:55.130
Death and the company is like a death in the family.
Talk relieves tension.

1691
01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:57.463
<v 5>Okay,</v>

1692
01:43:57.470 --> 01:44:00.560
<v 0>okay.
Talk relieves tension.
This is a tough one because guess what?</v>

1693
01:44:00.561 --> 01:44:03.080
Some people when something bad happens,
you know what they want to do.

1694
01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:04.470
They want to be left alone.
Yeah.

1695
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.450
AndW and yet it's talk that relieves tension to getting that out of them,

1696
01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:12.710
which I agree with.
But again,
you gotta be tactful.
There's a dichotomy.

1697
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:13.610
You just can't go,
hey man,

1698
01:44:13.611 --> 01:44:15.980
are you really want to talk to you about what happened?
It's like,
hey,

1699
01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:18.800
maybe that person needs a little time.
Maybe that person needs a little space,

1700
01:44:18.801 --> 01:44:20.990
but you can't give them too much time cause they're gonna sit there and dwell on

1701
01:44:20.991 --> 01:44:22.790
it.
Mm.
So pay attention.

1702
01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:25.330
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1703
01:44:25.330 --> 01:44:25.991
<v 0>The unit,</v>

1704
01:44:25.991 --> 01:44:29.590
which fights a successful action but is without knowledge of its success,

1705
01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:33.910
may even ensure a great victory for some larger body and still emerge from the

1706
01:44:33.911 --> 01:44:35.860
battlefield with a feeling of inferiority.

1707
01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:39.910
Because it's a complex sentence.
But what he's saying is like,

1708
01:44:39.970 --> 01:44:43.060
what do you make sure when your people do something good,
you tell them.

1709
01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.860
Cause there's a lot of times where people don't,

1710
01:44:45.370 --> 01:44:48.160
people don't understand what they did and how big of an impact it had.

1711
01:44:48.161 --> 01:44:48.994
And that's bad.

1712
01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:56.330
Here's a good one in combat,
nothing succeeds like success.

1713
01:44:56.570 --> 01:45:00.620
The knowledge of victory is the beginning of a conviction of superiority.

1714
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:04.970
Just as truly the savor of one small triumph,

1715
01:45:04.971 --> 01:45:09.380
we'll holy drive out the bitter taste of any number of demoralizing defeats.

1716
01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:11.280
<v 5>Okay?</v>

1717
01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.700
<v 0>Nothing succeeds like success.
No,
he didn't.</v>

1718
01:45:15.701 --> 01:45:20.380
This section tactical cohesion
important.

1719
01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:21.610
We're going to think about that.

1720
01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:27.400
You know there's a story in extreme ownership about the boat cruise and the boat

1721
01:45:27.401 --> 01:45:29.890
crew are doing well and sometimes people will say,
well,
you know,

1722
01:45:29.891 --> 01:45:33.820
what did the guy that do do different?
Well the new leader do w and I always say,

1723
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:38.830
or what he got the team to do is get everyone in the boat rowing the boat in the

1724
01:45:39.041 --> 01:45:42.880
same direction at the same time.
But like if you can do that,
you're winning.

1725
01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.800
If you can do that as a leader,

1726
01:45:44.801 --> 01:45:48.670
if you can get everybody in the boat rowing the boat in the same direction at

1727
01:45:48.671 --> 01:45:50.500
the same time,
you're going to win.

1728
01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:54.090
And you'd be surprised how often I see companies,
I see businesses,

1729
01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.190
I see military units where people are not rowing the boat in the same direction

1730
01:45:57.191 --> 01:46:01.390
at the same time.
So that's what tactical cohesion is.

1731
01:46:01.391 --> 01:46:06.391
Tactical reason is how can we get people to be working together and here we go.

1732
01:46:06.850 --> 01:46:10.240
Getting the troops to that cohesiveness back to the book.

1733
01:46:10.241 --> 01:46:15.040
It may be done through one bold individual standing erect and saying to a few

1734
01:46:15.041 --> 01:46:17.800
others,
follow me.
We are going on.

1735
01:46:18.570 --> 01:46:19.110
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1736
01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:22.770
<v 0>If a few rise and follow the entire line is apt to get in motion.</v>

1737
01:46:23.370 --> 01:46:27.900
On the other hand,
if this same individual advances alone but says nothing,

1738
01:46:27.901 --> 01:46:31.260
it is unlikely that he will have any followers.
One word,

1739
01:46:31.410 --> 01:46:36.410
calm makes his action 10 fold as effective as if he plunges gallantly ahead in

1740
01:46:36.661 --> 01:46:40.260
silence.
The act of moving his initiative,

1741
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:45.330
the act of coupling motion with speech is thinking initiative

1742
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:51.360
in port.
Very important,

1743
01:46:53.290 --> 01:46:53.610
<v 4>okay,</v>

1744
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:55.230
<v 0>here's talking about getting a gun fight.</v>

1745
01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.980
The first thing you do is you hit the ground is reestablished.

1746
01:46:57.981 --> 01:47:01.230
Contact with your men,
determine where they are and let them know where you are.

1747
01:47:01.410 --> 01:47:02.820
This.
This happens in business too.

1748
01:47:02.821 --> 01:47:06.210
Something bad happens and we all go into panic mode and start focusing on her

1749
01:47:06.211 --> 01:47:09.060
own little world.
As a leader,
you need to say,
okay guys,
here's what's going on.

1750
01:47:09.061 --> 01:47:13.770
Here's where I am.
Here's what we're going to do.
Leadership,
leadership,

1751
01:47:13.771 --> 01:47:14.940
leadership,
leadership.

1752
01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:21.160
The majority of small unit leaders do not take any steps toward restoring

1753
01:47:21.161 --> 01:47:24.010
control from which alone can come.
Unity of action.

1754
01:47:24.190 --> 01:47:28.240
Some try to contact their men by voice or by relay a voice during an action.

1755
01:47:28.241 --> 01:47:31.630
While the men are prone,
the voice will rarely carry more than 25 feet.

1756
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:36.870
This means that unless there is a relay of all hands under an and all hands,

1757
01:47:37.091 --> 01:47:38.350
understand what is being attempted.

1758
01:47:38.351 --> 01:47:41.410
The voice methods and effective in the seal teams.

1759
01:47:42.190 --> 01:47:45.730
When somebody yells out of command,
everybody says it and it's the best.

1760
01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:49.470
It's the coolest thing was not the coolest thing,
but it's pretty.

1761
01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:53.830
It's pretty cool when you hear that word getting passed and you hear the

1762
01:47:53.831 --> 01:47:58.831
criticalness of an important command coming out and everybody says it and it's

1763
01:47:59.651 --> 01:48:02.440
just that's what you have to do and were so well trained at that.

1764
01:48:03.010 --> 01:48:06.820
That's one of the few tactical things that you learned in basic underwater

1765
01:48:06.821 --> 01:48:10.540
demolition seal training gets you better pass the word pass the word man.

1766
01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:14.200
It's one of those things.
It's one of those things you learn to pass the word.

1767
01:48:14.710 --> 01:48:15.543
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1768
01:48:17.530 --> 01:48:19.030
<v 0>this is,
this is a great point.</v>

1769
01:48:19.570 --> 01:48:24.570
The company coming under fire literally begins its engagement by falling apart.

1770
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.420
So when you start getting shot at,
guess what you do?
You get down,

1771
01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.110
you can't see anyone else and you don't know what's happening.

1772
01:48:32.111 --> 01:48:34.540
So your first thing that happens when you get engaged as you fall apart

1773
01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:38.740
thereafter,
so long as it continues to engage,

1774
01:48:38.741 --> 01:48:42.160
the overriding problem with the commander is the reunification of his elements.

1775
01:48:42.161 --> 01:48:44.590
This is a great way to think about,
so all your tactical leaders out there,

1776
01:48:45.190 --> 01:48:48.280
military,
police,
firefighters,
this is important.

1777
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:53.050
Think about this after the thing,
after the engagement starts.

1778
01:48:53.051 --> 01:48:55.450
The overriding problem with the commander is the reuse.

1779
01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.250
We unification of his elements,

1780
01:48:57.910 --> 01:49:01.480
proper fire support and direction are [inaudible] are among the tools which he

1781
01:49:01.481 --> 01:49:06.310
uses and bringing about cohesion.
But the fundamental means is communication.

1782
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:10.960
Getting his men to link up by talking to one another and sending along word of

1783
01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:13.090
what they are doing and what they have seen.

1784
01:49:14.690 --> 01:49:18.410
Now this is a very simple thing.
It is so simple,

1785
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.670
<v 4>okay</v>

1786
01:49:19.670 --> 01:49:24.670
<v 0>that it recalls the warning from Colonel G F R Henderson in war.</v>

1787
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:27.650
The simple things are the most difficult

1788
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:30.953
<v 4>pass the heart.</v>

1789
01:49:33.790 --> 01:49:38.770
<v 0>We say that we seek initiative in our men.
That is the American way of fighting.</v>

1790
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:43.610
We say that we want men who can think and act.
We are just steadfast.
However,

1791
01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:47.680
in in proclaiming that the supreme object and training is produced unity of

1792
01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:52.210
action.
These two aims are not mutually exclusive.

1793
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:56.650
In fact,
they are complimentary halves of an enlightened battle discipline.

1794
01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.130
So did you catch that?
We want our people to act.

1795
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:02.740
We want our people to act for themselves.

1796
01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.540
We want them to think and act and at the same time we want uniform,
unified,

1797
01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.020
a unity of command.

1798
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:10.930
We want them to be working together so we want them to act alone and we want

1799
01:50:10.931 --> 01:50:12.940
them to work together.
There's obviously a dichotomy there.

1800
01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:17.320
Those are the complimentary halves of an enlightened battled Hussman.
Here we go.

1801
01:50:17.321 --> 01:50:18.154
This is beautiful,

1802
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:23.580
but the various curious part of it is that law is that training largely ignores

1803
01:50:23.651 --> 01:50:28.651
the sole principle which makes these two basic ideas fully and finally

1804
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.580
reconcilable.

1805
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:35.260
We do not teach our men from the day they first put on the uniform.

1806
01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:40.440
That speech in combat is as vital as fire in combat.

1807
01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:49.600
Speech in combat is as vital as fire in combat.

1808
01:50:49.930 --> 01:50:54.550
We do not say to them that for a man to be able to think straight about his

1809
01:50:54.551 --> 01:50:56.320
tactical situation is not enough.

1810
01:50:56.350 --> 01:51:01.350
He must communicate his thoughts to others before they can begin to produce

1811
01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:02.830
unity of action

1812
01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.270
out of speech or from the written word,

1813
01:51:07.271 --> 01:51:12.271
which is its substitute comes all unification of strength on the battle field

1814
01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.700
and from the ladder comes decisive action.

1815
01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:19.180
This applies to two men serving together on an outpost.

1816
01:51:19.181 --> 01:51:22.110
It applies equally to the battalion or the regiment

1817
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:27.310
right there,
right there.

1818
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:32.410
If you can't communicate with the other people and people don't spread the word

1819
01:51:32.411 --> 01:51:34.870
and your team doesn't communicate well with each other,

1820
01:51:35.170 --> 01:51:38.110
you're not going to be able to join these two halfs,

1821
01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.640
which is acting and being decisive and being using initiative and cohesiveness

1822
01:51:46.451 --> 01:51:47.284
of your unit.

1823
01:51:51.070 --> 01:51:52.060
The question still remains,

1824
01:51:52.061 --> 01:51:56.860
what kind of initiative is beneficial and what kind is harmful and how may

1825
01:51:56.861 --> 01:52:00.520
troops would be,
might,
might be taught to distinguish between the two,
right?

1826
01:52:00.521 --> 01:52:05.230
So could a person on your,
in your platoon take so much initiative that it hurts?

1827
01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:10.360
Oh yes,
they can.
I seen it many times before,
many times before I've seen that.

1828
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:15.780
So the question is how do we know how much that,
there's a dichotomy,
right?

1829
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:17.030
We want people to have action,
but we don't,

1830
01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.240
don't want them to take too much action.

1831
01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:23.010
I'm glad I wrote the book that carbonated Jeff and here's,

1832
01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:26.340
here's his way of trying to define that.

1833
01:52:26.341 --> 01:52:31.341
Is the soldier acting on his own to advise others of his tactical situation or

1834
01:52:31.561 --> 01:52:36.540
conveying any other information which may be of general benefits in furthering

1835
01:52:36.541 --> 01:52:40.980
the tactical situation of the company or an enlisting the aid of others in

1836
01:52:40.981 --> 01:52:45.590
carrying out any action which will benefit the tactical situation of company.

1837
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:47.880
So you,
you,

1838
01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:50.930
you need to take action and you need to take initiative as long as it's

1839
01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:53.770
benefiting the company.
Hmm.
As long as you're,

1840
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:55.730
and you know what we talk about his commanders in tent,

1841
01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.940
like you can do whatever you want as long as it isn't supportive commander's

1842
01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:00.590
intent.
If it's non sportive commander's intent,
we got a problem.

1843
01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:01.603
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1844
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.320
<v 0>In the army of the United States,</v>

1845
01:53:07.321 --> 01:53:12.321
we act towards speech as if it were mortally as if we were mortally afraid of

1846
01:53:12.331 --> 01:53:12.960
it.

1847
01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.610
We tell our men to think yet we never tell them that if in combat they remained

1848
01:53:16.611 --> 01:53:20.640
dumb.
It is slow suicide,
slow suicide.

1849
01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:27.460
The period between wars was an age of rapid advancement in communications

1850
01:53:27.461 --> 01:53:30.280
technique.
Radio was born,
the telephone was vastly improved.

1851
01:53:30.281 --> 01:53:33.130
The teleprinters appeared in television,
waited just around the corner.

1852
01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:38.020
It all came so fast that we were struck dumb by her own magic.

1853
01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:44.940
How brilliant is that?
We were struck dumb by own magic.

1854
01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:50.070
How many people these days are,
are big,

1855
01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:52.830
not becoming good communicators because they're not interacting with people

1856
01:53:52.831 --> 01:53:56.100
enough cause instead of talking to them or send them a text instead of talking

1857
01:53:56.101 --> 01:54:00.240
to them there they're,
you have an email that'll,
how is that affecting us?
Yup.

1858
01:54:00.450 --> 01:54:01.950
Pretty much everybody.
Pretty much everybody.

1859
01:54:04.230 --> 01:54:07.720
You've got emojis coming out,
right?
I don't know.

1860
01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:11.040
That might be in the step in the right direction.
Right.
The additional emojis,

1861
01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:13.110
additional communication,
what it is,

1862
01:54:13.170 --> 01:54:17.670
it does add some clarity to your statements,
give you credits.

1863
01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:21.270
Maybe I need to get in the Emoji game.
Maybe not happening,

1864
01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:24.980
but you know that that's a great thing.

1865
01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:27.540
You talk about raising kids to make sure you talk to your kids.

1866
01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.610
I work with someone once that had a kid that had like a speech impediment and

1867
01:54:33.810 --> 01:54:38.100
this kid would just sit down and talk your ear off with speech impediment and,

1868
01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:43.110
and I talked to the parent and said,
hey,
you got one confident kid,

1869
01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:47.280
you know,
with speech impediment.
Yeah.
How did you get him to overcome,
you know,

1870
01:54:47.281 --> 01:54:50.610
this,
this speech impediment or the,

1871
01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:53.190
it's not so much the speech impediment cause he didn't overcome and still had
it,

1872
01:54:53.730 --> 01:54:56.280
but guess what was going to talk your ear off and was going to sit down and act

1873
01:54:56.281 --> 01:55:01.140
professional and get it conveys a message and the response was got them to talk

1874
01:55:01.141 --> 01:55:04.140
to people all the time.
Yeah.
And,
and made them talk to people.

1875
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:09.330
And so that's what you do get,
have conversations with your kids.

1876
01:55:09.331 --> 01:55:13.890
How's that?
Yeah.
Have conversations with your people on your team.

1877
01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:14.873
How's that?

1878
01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:15.903
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:19.820
<v 0>Is that one of the reasons why podcasts are popular?</v>

1880
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:23.670
Because you get to hear conversations between people because you're not hearing

1881
01:55:23.671 --> 01:55:24.504
them otherwise.

1882
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:26.350
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe.</v>

1883
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:31.340
<v 0>Here's what he's saying.
Uh,
this is just good advice for this as a fall.</v>

1884
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:33.620
You folks that are thinking about joining the military.
Here we go.

1885
01:55:33.621 --> 01:55:36.230
When you prepare to fight,
you must prepare to talk.

1886
01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.830
You must learn that speech will help you save your situation.

1887
01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:43.800
You must be alert at all times to let others know what is happening to you.

1888
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:48.950
You must use your brain and your voice anytime that any word of yours will help

1889
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:50.640
you or others.

1890
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.780
You are a tactical unit and you must think of yourself that way.

1891
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:58.530
Don't try to win a war or capture hill all by yourself.

1892
01:55:58.650 --> 01:56:02.430
You're action alone means nothing or at best,
very little.

1893
01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:06.240
It is when you talk to others and they join with you,

1894
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:11.370
that your action becomes important.
Gotta communicate.

1895
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.740
Yeah,

1896
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:21.730
this is life tells a story about me telling him to use verbal commands and we've

1897
01:56:21.731 --> 01:56:24.220
got that story over and over again cause I've done it with through so many

1898
01:56:24.221 --> 01:56:28.480
different people like you need to,
you need to use your man voice right now.

1899
01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:33.430
Like you're not being loud enough.
And that was a classic example of that.

1900
01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:33.671
You know,

1901
01:56:33.671 --> 01:56:36.980
life trying to communicate over the radio and people aren't really than,

1902
01:56:36.981 --> 01:56:40.060
because it's put noise in your ears,
credit,
all these things happen and you,

1903
01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:43.510
you know,
you hit a little voice.
And in the seal teams,
like I said,

1904
01:56:43.511 --> 01:56:46.830
we're so trained to repeat those commands.
And I'm like,
life,

1905
01:56:46.831 --> 01:56:49.540
you've got to try using versus verbal commands,
Bro.
You got to try it.

1906
01:56:50.110 --> 01:56:51.790
And he kind of looked at me like,
man,

1907
01:56:51.791 --> 01:56:55.330
I'm giving the perfect brief over the radio right now.
My men will respond.

1908
01:56:56.110 --> 01:56:58.340
And so finally,
you know,
he is,
you know,

1909
01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:03.070
angry Lafe came out and he said [inaudible] he yelled and everyone repeated and

1910
01:57:03.071 --> 01:57:07.150
everything happened.
And it was one of those things.
And it's,
I mean,
this is what,

1911
01:57:07.151 --> 01:57:09.790
10 years ago,
12 years ago,

1912
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:13.870
but it was definitely,
we all had radios on everybody.

1913
01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.640
Every single person had a nice radio,

1914
01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:19.660
the same radio that's being used today with a,
with a noise canceling headset.

1915
01:57:19.661 --> 01:57:22.460
Do you know what that is?
Yes sir.
Okay.
Yeah.
So what noise canceling.

1916
01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:25.450
So you'd think,
what could be better than that?

1917
01:57:25.451 --> 01:57:28.570
What could be better than this brand new modern technology with a noise

1918
01:57:28.571 --> 01:57:31.420
canceling headset.
You know it's better than that.
Your Voice.

1919
01:57:32.710 --> 01:57:37.300
That's saying a lot with the voice canceling headset and the voices better.
Yeah.

1920
01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:42.130
Well,
when you've got the noise canceling headset it,
it shuts off the sound.

1921
01:57:42.131 --> 01:57:44.470
So when you're shooting your gun,
there's no sound coming in.

1922
01:57:44.471 --> 01:57:49.080
Now you don't hear whatever's being told to you.
Check.

1923
01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:52.360
All right,
one final statement on that.

1924
01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:57.070
Men Governed by words,
speech galvanizes.

1925
01:57:57.071 --> 01:58:00.940
The desire to work together is the beginning of the urge to get something done.

1926
01:58:01.210 --> 01:58:05.830
So learn how to communicate,
read,
study English,

1927
01:58:09.130 --> 01:58:13.150
learn how to write.
It's gonna make you a better communicator.
All right,

1928
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:15.340
now we go to why men fight.

1929
01:58:16.330 --> 01:58:20.110
When a retro grade movement becomes necessary in combat,

1930
01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:24.160
it is an invitation to disaster to move before the men are told why they are a

1931
01:58:24.161 --> 01:58:27.040
moving.
If the pressure is made,

1932
01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:31.810
the fact that that fact obvious than they still must be told how far to go and

1933
01:58:31.811 --> 01:58:35.020
the line or point to which they are withdrawing must be made clear and

1934
01:58:35.021 --> 01:58:38.530
unmistakable.
Otherwise they will keep moving and all control will be lost.

1935
01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:44.080
The spoken word is the of steadying forces in any time a crisis.

1936
01:58:44.230 --> 01:58:45.063
Think about that.

1937
01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:51.360
The spoken word is the greatest of steadying forces in any time of crisis and

1938
01:58:52.631 --> 01:58:56.110
excited.
Lieutenant shouting,
get the Hell Outta here and follow me to that tree.

1939
01:58:56.670 --> 01:58:59.950
If all me,
that tree line on the far side of the creek will succeed.

1940
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:05.440
They'll perfectly calm captain trying to bring off the same movement,

1941
01:59:05.441 --> 01:59:08.980
but keeping his voice call for keeping his voice down with the result that the

1942
01:59:08.981 --> 01:59:11.740
men do not hear him will fail.
That's obvious.

1943
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:17.980
Formal language under these circumstances is almost unknown in the army of the

1944
01:59:17.981 --> 01:59:19.480
United States.
In fact,

1945
01:59:19.481 --> 01:59:24.481
get the hell out of here has virtually established itself in our jargon as the

1946
01:59:25.331 --> 01:59:26.560
customary wardrobe.

1947
01:59:28.930 --> 01:59:29.763
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1948
01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:34.960
<v 0>said Drent General Dragon Dragomir off a strong moral education is the best</v>

1949
01:59:38.691 --> 01:59:41.810
safeguard to solidarity of troops under fire.

1950
01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:45.710
Even so the soldier will forget or discount much.

1951
01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:49.610
That training has taught him as the danger mounts and fear takes hold.

1952
01:59:50.150 --> 01:59:51.120
It is then the,

1953
01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:56.750
it is then that the voice of the leader must cut through fear to remind him of

1954
01:59:56.751 --> 02:00:00.050
what is required.
The reason IX,

1955
02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:05.320
the reasoned explanation of why this is true has never been more clearly stated.

1956
02:00:05.601 --> 02:00:10.601
Then by staff Sargent Pete f dying of the 17th Infantry Regiment after he'd won

1957
02:00:12.711 --> 02:00:17.711
the Silver Star for taking over the leading of a demoralized platoon during the

1958
02:00:18.081 --> 02:00:19.220
burden island fight,

1959
02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:24.240
and here's staff Sergeant Pete dying.

1960
02:00:25.050 --> 02:00:27.930
I knew that the men were afraid and careless.
At the same time,

1961
02:00:28.530 --> 02:00:29.730
though some were being killed,

1962
02:00:29.731 --> 02:00:34.050
the others would not take even average precautions and going after the enemy

1963
02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:36.330
installations as we pass through them.

1964
02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:42.320
I knew they were afraid because I was aware of my own fear that I asked myself

1965
02:00:43.890 --> 02:00:48.780
why it was that we felt fear in each other and I realized it was because all of

1966
02:00:48.781 --> 02:00:50.880
the leaders had quit talking.

1967
02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:56.040
I knew then that the only way to get confidence back into the platoon was to

1968
02:00:56.041 --> 02:00:58.920
talk it up as a man might do in a football game.

1969
02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:03.930
I continued my own attack on the enemy shelters and spider holes,

1970
02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:05.370
but there was a difference.

1971
02:01:06.170 --> 02:01:06.600
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1972
02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:11.430
<v 0>that now begin.
Yeah,
that I'm now began yelling to others.
Watch me.</v>

1973
02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.930
This is what you're supposed to do.
Get at it.
Keep working.
Keep your eyes open.

1974
02:01:17.010 --> 02:01:20.970
Soon.
The platoon became collected and began to operate methodically,

1975
02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:24.480
but I kept talking until the end because I had learned something.

1976
02:01:24.481 --> 02:01:28.200
New leaders must talk if they are to lead.

1977
02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:32.850
Action is not enough.
A silent example,
we'll never rally men.

1978
02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:34.653
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1979
02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:38.480
<v 0>gets on or get at it</v>

1980
02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:42.830
in battle.
Back to the book in battle,

1981
02:01:42.831 --> 02:01:46.940
the Voice of the leader is always needed to call back the men from carelessness.

1982
02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:50.990
It is their chronic attitude in and out of danger.

1983
02:01:51.230 --> 02:01:53.960
Even in veteran troops,
it is not expected.

1984
02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:57.020
It is not the expected presence of the enemy,

1985
02:01:57.021 --> 02:01:59.240
which keeps them alert on a hostile field,

1986
02:01:59.241 --> 02:02:04.241
but the force with which they feel pressing them at any given moment when fire

1987
02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:06.740
comes against them,

1988
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:10.580
they sense danger from every direction unless they are informed of the source of

1989
02:02:10.581 --> 02:02:12.680
the danger.
There is apt to occur.

1990
02:02:12.710 --> 02:02:17.710
A swift moral transition in which they become mentally pinned by the mere

1991
02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:21.110
incidents of fire.
I like that term,
mentally pinned.

1992
02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:24.110
You just don't know what's going on.
Someone's couple pin down.

1993
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:28.040
This was interesting on seven occasions has been my part,

1994
02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:32.720
part of my duty to investigate the sources of panic along the battle line twice

1995
02:02:32.721 --> 02:02:34.610
in the Pacific and five times in Europe.

1996
02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:40.420
So there was times where people just panicked and left the line and he had to

1997
02:02:40.491 --> 02:02:41.324
investigate him

1998
02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:46.250
and he goes into that was how each of these incidents,

1999
02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.490
each of these seven and the incidents got it start one or two,

2000
02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:53.360
one or two or more men made a sudden run to the rear,

2001
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:56.600
which others in the vicinity did not understand,

2002
02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:01.100
but it was the lack of information rather than the site of running men,

2003
02:03:01.101 --> 02:03:04.040
which was the crux of the danger for an every case.

2004
02:03:04.041 --> 02:03:08.340
The testimony of all witnesses clearly developed the fact that those who'd

2005
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:12.170
started the run and thereby spread the fear which started the panic,

2006
02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:15.470
had a legitimate,
or at least reasonable excuse for the action.

2007
02:03:16.190 --> 02:03:20.660
It was not the sudden motion,
which of itself did not did the damage,

2008
02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:24.830
but the fact that the others present or not kept informed.

2009
02:03:28.110 --> 02:03:32.160
Got It.
Your people got to know what's going on.
For example,

2010
02:03:32.250 --> 02:03:37.250
a sergeant and the first battalion 502nd infantry was hit through the and artery

2011
02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.720
during the Keratin causeway fight on June 12th,

2012
02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:44.280
1944 it happened in a flash.

2013
02:03:44.490 --> 02:03:47.760
One second he was hit and the next he was running for a first aid station

2014
02:03:47.761 --> 02:03:50.430
without telling his own squad why he was getting out.

2015
02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:54.210
They took out after him and then the line broke.

2016
02:03:54.690 --> 02:03:58.590
Others who hadn't seen the sergeant make his dash saw someone else in flight.

2017
02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:02.670
They ran too.
Someone said,
the order is to withdraw.

2018
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:07.170
Others picked up the word and cried it along the line,
withdraw,
withdraw.

2019
02:04:07.290 --> 02:04:11.910
It happened just as simply as that.
You could see how that happened all day long.

2020
02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:12.744
Right?

2021
02:04:13.890 --> 02:04:18.780
The term control is not in this instance to be considered as synonymous with the

2022
02:04:18.781 --> 02:04:23.100
voice of authority control as a man to man force on the battlefield.

2023
02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:25.080
No matter how lowly his rank,

2024
02:04:25.110 --> 02:04:29.550
any man who controls himself automatically contributes to the control of others.

2025
02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:31.733
That's legit.

2026
02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:36.120
Any man who controls himself automatically contributes to the control of others.

2027
02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:40.410
Fear is but so,
but courage is not less so

2028
02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:45.000
to the man who is in terror and verging on panic.

2029
02:04:45.001 --> 02:04:49.860
No influence can be more steadying then that he sees some other man near him who

2030
02:04:49.861 --> 02:04:52.740
is rich,
retaining self control and doing his duty.

2031
02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:57.780
It's weird how people are just so influenced by other people.

2032
02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.730
I mean you see it everywhere.

2033
02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:08.620
Personal honor is the one thing valued more than life itself by the majority of

2034
02:05:08.751 --> 02:05:11.120
men.
The lips of the dying a test.

2035
02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:15.440
How strongly this force influences individual conduct in battle.

2036
02:05:16.610 --> 02:05:21.610
A young company runner hit by a shell at Keratin collapsed into the arms of his

2037
02:05:22.521 --> 02:05:26.630
commander and with his life swiftly ebbing,
said,
captain,

2038
02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:31.370
this company always called me a screw up.
Tell me that I wasn't.

2039
02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.470
Tell me that I wasn't one.
This time the captain replied,
no son,

2040
02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:40.880
you sure warrant and the board died with a smile on his face.

2041
02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:46.730
But an army is a collection of individuals.

2042
02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:51.940
It is also a crowd under pressure and under pressure at tends to ever to revert

2043
02:05:53.150 --> 02:05:57.250
to crowd form the seeds of panic or always present in troops.

2044
02:05:57.251 --> 02:05:59.930
So long as they are in the midst of physical danger.

2045
02:06:00.110 --> 02:06:03.980
The form of which changes moment to moment and the majority of men,

2046
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:08.780
the retention of self discipline under the conditions of the battlefield depends

2047
02:06:08.781 --> 02:06:11.810
on the maintaining of an appearance of discipline within the unit.

2048
02:06:12.190 --> 02:06:13.023
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2049
02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:18.900
<v 0>so obvious as he with businesses,
man with businesses,</v>

2050
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:21.030
you'll get a business that like people are squared away.

2051
02:06:21.031 --> 02:06:24.840
That's how they roll every one ax squared away and you get some people that

2052
02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:28.020
aren't and that's the,
that's the image.

2053
02:06:28.050 --> 02:06:30.510
That's the culture of the company and no one's squared away.

2054
02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:35.400
Should the ladder begin to dissolve.

2055
02:06:35.401 --> 02:06:39.150
So should the discipline with an unit begin to dissolve only a small minority of

2056
02:06:39.151 --> 02:06:41.880
the most hardy individuals will retain self control.

2057
02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:47.120
The others cannot stand fast if the circumstances appear to justify flight when

2058
02:06:47.701 --> 02:06:48.481
other men flee,

2059
02:06:48.481 --> 02:06:53.190
the social pressure is lifted and the average soldier or respond as if he has

2060
02:06:53.191 --> 02:06:56.670
been given a free released from duty free knows that his personal failure is

2061
02:06:56.671 --> 02:06:59.370
mating conspicuous by the general dissolution

2062
02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:05.960
to it is a normal tendency in troops that they will drift rearward from the fire

2063
02:07:06.811 --> 02:07:10.500
line unless they are being given an active direction.

2064
02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:15.000
But it is just as normal that they will reverse themselves quickly and returned

2065
02:07:15.001 --> 02:07:18.330
to their duty of given a firm order by someone whom they know.

2066
02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:24.540
Yeah.
And have you ever been a situation where you just like put out word like,

2067
02:07:24.541 --> 02:07:24.750
like,

2068
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:28.800
like just something stupid like I'm like you'll be in a store or something and

2069
02:07:28.801 --> 02:07:31.830
people,
people will be like not knowing,
hey,
they're just someone to say,

2070
02:07:31.831 --> 02:07:36.370
hey there's a register over here.
Or like you're at a waiting in a line at a,

2071
02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:40.750
at a,
at a public event of some kind,
you know,
hey,
wrap this thing around,

2072
02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:43.360
wrap the line around.
Yeah.
And everyone just does it.

2073
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:48.220
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
Like at the,
I think this is kind of what you're talking about too.</v>

2074
02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:53.000
Like at the airport,
Dale super late,
remember to get on the plane,

2075
02:07:54.610 --> 02:07:58.700
uh,
Washington DC and went to the wrong airport last minute,
last second,

2076
02:07:58.730 --> 02:08:02.480
by the way.
Anyway,
I'm standing in the TSA line.

2077
02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:07.940
I see super long,
by the way,
when I see super Supergirl,
I mean like,

2078
02:08:08.150 --> 02:08:11.660
like you ain't gonna make it flatten.
Yeah.
This long,
long,
like a long line.

2079
02:08:11.661 --> 02:08:16.040
Like there was a crowd.
So I'm standing in line,
I'm like,
she,
you know,

2080
02:08:16.041 --> 02:08:16.940
when you're in a hurry,

2081
02:08:16.941 --> 02:08:20.770
you're always looking for little shortcuts and all violate a few rules,
you know,

2082
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:23.210
to get there quicker.
So I'm on the lookout.

2083
02:08:23.330 --> 02:08:26.790
Everyone else's screws just falling in line.
Literally.
Uh,

2084
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:31.990
so I look and I see a weird sort of line start off kind of forming,

2085
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:36.740
right.
Way shorter too,
like the kind like I can,

2086
02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:41.800
I can literally literally walk about 15 meters ahead to the end of this weird

2087
02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:45.980
little line for me.
Everyone sees it.
It's a little line,

2088
02:08:45.981 --> 02:08:48.410
but it's kind of like one of the things I go,
that's not what we're doing.

2089
02:08:48.590 --> 02:08:51.970
And I think the lines make it even more psychologically rigid,
you know,

2090
02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:54.570
where it's like we're in line and to get out of line.

2091
02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:55.460
That's the kind of a big deal.

2092
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:59.660
<v 0>Is this the social,
what does he call it here?
The social,</v>

2093
02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:03.290
you get the release from social duty,
right?

2094
02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:05.733
<v 2>Yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah.</v>

2095
02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:08.550
Everyone's standing in line and you're just doing what everyone else did.

2096
02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:12.090
There's like a social pressure to stay in line.
Yes,
exactly right.
So,
but boom,

2097
02:09:12.091 --> 02:09:14.350
I man,
I was going to miss that flight.
So

2098
02:09:16.330 --> 02:09:18.520
I ask,
oh how's this?

2099
02:09:18.521 --> 02:09:22.330
I asked the guy not like in that line,
cause it's way ahead.

2100
02:09:22.331 --> 02:09:27.100
I asked the guy in the next line who like maybe two,
three people ahead of me,

2101
02:09:27.101 --> 02:09:30.940
but in a different light.
I was like,
is that in another line?
And He,
you know,

2102
02:09:30.941 --> 02:09:34.930
he says,
he said,
yeah it is.
He goes,
yeah it is.
I was like,
oh I just go,

2103
02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:38.920
you already know it.
But then he was like standing like he didn't do it.

2104
02:09:38.921 --> 02:09:42.790
Probably from that social pressure.
So of course I go and that everyone falls,

2105
02:09:42.791 --> 02:09:46.540
bro.
I looked behind everyone.
I fear like a commotion behind me,

2106
02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:48.550
but it's just so many people filling in.
That's true.

2107
02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.640
That's how freaking leading from the running.

2108
02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:56.330
And I made the flight by literally like what,
10 seconds probably are close.
Yeah.

2109
02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:00.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2110
02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:04.770
<v 0>This is a,
again,
I kind of covered this,
but I'm gonna hate it.
One more time.</v>

2111
02:10:05.010 --> 02:10:09.720
Individual stragglers had almost no combat value in inducted into a strange

2112
02:10:09.721 --> 02:10:13.800
organization.
The majority of them were unwilling to join any such solid unit,

2113
02:10:13.801 --> 02:10:16.440
which still facing the enemy.
The minority,

2114
02:10:16.530 --> 02:10:20.100
even after being given food and a little rest took their place in line.

2115
02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:23.310
But the moment the new unit came under enemy pressure,

2116
02:10:23.550 --> 02:10:27.900
the individual's quit their ground and ran rearward or soughts cover behind

2117
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:31.260
somewhere behind the combat line.
So this is what I were talking about.

2118
02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:34.670
You get a new person and they don't know they're not going to do their job.

2119
02:10:34.671 --> 02:10:37.250
On the other hand,
this is important for businesses.
On the other hand,

2120
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:39.230
that was not true of gun crews,

2121
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:43.190
squad groups or platoon which had been routed from their original ground and

2122
02:10:43.191 --> 02:10:47.420
separate from their parent unit but had managed in some way to hold together

2123
02:10:47.421 --> 02:10:51.560
during a fall.
Back upon being inducted into a strange company,

2124
02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:55.430
they tended to fight as vigorously as any element in the command which they had

2125
02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:59.840
newly joined and would frequently set an example of initiative and courageous

2126
02:10:59.841 --> 02:11:04.610
action beyond what had been asked of them.
Think about that.
Keep your,

2127
02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.420
keep your little elements together.
I used to be real big on that.

2128
02:11:09.110 --> 02:11:12.380
You've got your little fire teams and I would always try and keep a little fire

2129
02:11:12.381 --> 02:11:13.214
team integrity.

2130
02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:16.670
Keep that fire team integrity and these will be like in a soup spoon.

2131
02:11:16.671 --> 02:11:19.460
There's four.
There's four fire teams in a,
in a task unit.

2132
02:11:19.461 --> 02:11:21.500
You know there's eight fire teams.
Try and keep.

2133
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:23.690
These guys still know each other but they're going to do a little bit better.

2134
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:26.060
They just keep that fire team and tech.
They already know each other them.

2135
02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:26.913
They already know what's up

2136
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:32.270
in our striving for a system of discipline,

2137
02:11:32.271 --> 02:11:36.680
which recognizes in theory they'll the theories offered ignored and practice

2138
02:11:36.681 --> 02:11:40.100
that the relationships within our army should be based upon intimate

2139
02:11:40.101 --> 02:11:45.101
understanding between officers and men rather than familiarity between them on

2140
02:11:46.401 --> 02:11:51.401
self respect rather than fear and above all on uniting comradeship,

2141
02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:59.450
self respect rather than fear.
This is,

2142
02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:05.390
they have destroyed the name and tradition of old and honored regiments with the

2143
02:12:05.391 --> 02:12:08.330
stroke of a pen for convenience sake.

2144
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:14.050
They have uprooted the names and numbers which had identity with a certain soil

2145
02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:17.930
and move them willy nilly to another soil.

2146
02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:21.560
They have moved men around as if they were pegs and nothing counted,

2147
02:12:21.561 --> 02:12:23.750
but a specialist classification number.

2148
02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.880
They've become fillers of holes rather than architects of human spirit.

2149
02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:32.600
That's bold isn't it?
You like them.

2150
02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:38.420
So sometimes the army and the army does this more than anyone else,

2151
02:12:38.421 --> 02:12:39.254
I believe.

2152
02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:44.180
They'll just like take a unit that's been around for 122 years and fought and

2153
02:12:44.181 --> 02:12:46.010
all kinds of wars and just disband them.
They're done.

2154
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:51.020
Just get rid of them and just,
and sometimes they bring them back,
thankfully,

2155
02:12:51.410 --> 02:12:56.210
but that's not a good idea.
There's a certain power in tradition,
right?

2156
02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:59.150
There's a certain power in tradition.
There's a,

2157
02:13:00.650 --> 02:13:03.650
when they formed up seal team five they took,

2158
02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:06.620
they took seal team or sorry,

2159
02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:11.980
underwater demolition team 11 and they disbanded it and basically reformed it.

2160
02:13:12.291 --> 02:13:14.920
A seal team five.
But if you look at the,

2161
02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:17.600
the symbol of seal team five,

2162
02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:21.800
there's a setting sun and on the setting sun is the number 11 can see it going

2163
02:13:21.801 --> 02:13:24.770
down.
Little little fact for you.
Pretty cool.

2164
02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:27.410
But they at least kept that tradition alive.
Right?

2165
02:13:27.610 --> 02:13:31.870
Lisa kept that tradition alive.
Yeah.
Um,

2166
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:35.370
and yes,
this idea of fillers of holes rather than architects,
human spirit,

2167
02:13:35.371 --> 02:13:37.230
you got to think about what you're doing with a little units when you start

2168
02:13:37.231 --> 02:13:38.820
breaking them up and moving people around.
There's this,

2169
02:13:38.821 --> 02:13:40.740
there's relationships there that you're messing with.

2170
02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.380
You might not be doing a good thing just because this guy has a certain

2171
02:13:43.381 --> 02:13:44.660
qualification,
I'll put them over there.

2172
02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:50.960
There in lies a great weakness and we have suffered from it through every war

2173
02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:52.560
for it must ever remain.

2174
02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:57.860
That acquisition of a true knowledge of the nature of man in war will suffice it

2175
02:13:58.351 --> 02:14:03.030
very little if put to work only by the local commander on limited ground,

2176
02:14:04.630 --> 02:14:08.700
so everybody's got to understand that there's a human beings working here that

2177
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:09.620
you're dealing with you,

2178
02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:14.720
that you have to be an architect of the human spirit that again leaves too much

2179
02:14:14.721 --> 02:14:17.990
to chance and puts too high a premium and on the virtues and talents of the

2180
02:14:17.991 --> 02:14:21.980
average leader,
what is needed primarily if we are to go forward,

2181
02:14:21.981 --> 02:14:23.630
the policy stemming from the top,

2182
02:14:23.631 --> 02:14:28.631
which are based not upon slide rule calculations but on knowledge of the human

2183
02:14:30.411 --> 02:14:31.244
heart.

2184
02:14:31.690 --> 02:14:32.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2185
02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:35.860
<v 0>Next chapter,
the the aggressive will</v>

2186
02:14:37.570 --> 02:14:42.130
I like this little section.
Morale is the thinking of an army.

2187
02:14:42.850 --> 02:14:46.480
It is the whole complex body of an army's thought.

2188
02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:51.340
The way it feels about the soil and about the people from which it's springs,

2189
02:14:51.670 --> 02:14:55.570
the way that it feels about their cause and their politics as compared with

2190
02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:57.700
other causes and other politics.

2191
02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:02.680
The way that it feels about its friends and allies as well as its enemies about

2192
02:15:02.681 --> 02:15:06.760
it's commanders and gold bricks about food and shelter,

2193
02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:11.680
duty and leisure.
Militarism and civilian ism.
Freedom and slavery.

2194
02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:14.570
Work and want weapons and comradeship.

2195
02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:18.640
Bunk fatigue and drill discipline and disorder.

2196
02:15:18.850 --> 02:15:22.180
Life and death.
God and the devil.

2197
02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:27.620
That's a big,
that's a big,
that's what he's saying,

2198
02:15:28.190 --> 02:15:33.190
like you've got human beings and the morale of the army is all of that stuff

2199
02:15:33.501 --> 02:15:35.900
combined together.
You have to account for it.

2200
02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:36.953
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

2201
02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:42.730
<v 0>The definition cuts through one of the oldest myths in the military book.</v>

2202
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:45.460
That morale comes from disciplined.

2203
02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:47.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2204
02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:50.370
<v 0>The process is precisely the reverse.</v>

2205
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:53.970
True discipline is the product of morale.

2206
02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:01.170
Right.
I never really thought about that too much.

2207
02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.430
How's your morale?
If you have good morale,

2208
02:16:05.431 --> 02:16:08.580
you're going to have better discipline.
If your morale is weak,

2209
02:16:08.581 --> 02:16:10.620
what happens to your discipline?
Goes out the window.

2210
02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:16.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2211
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:20.630
<v 0>The soldier needs a sound and vigorous body if he has to contend in modern war,</v>

2212
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:25.750
but this itself should be the object rather than the perfecting of him in drills

2213
02:16:26.391 --> 02:16:30.610
not even remotely related to use of his weapons out of a mistaken and

2214
02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:32.470
obsolescent notion

2215
02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:36.580
that they somehow improve his discipline.

2216
02:16:36.581 --> 02:16:38.740
There was no such time for math for this method,

2217
02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:42.250
so doing stuff just to do it,

2218
02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:47.350
to like improve your discipline does not what we're talking about here beyond

2219
02:16:47.351 --> 02:16:48.610
the basic physical requirement,

2220
02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:52.900
the essential is that he be given the freedom to think with a clear mind which

2221
02:16:52.901 --> 02:16:54.970
freedom can be his.

2222
02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.050
Only when he becomes convinced that the army and particularly the army as

2223
02:16:59.051 --> 02:17:00.970
represented by his immediate superiors,

2224
02:17:00.971 --> 02:17:03.670
is doing everything possible for his welfare.

2225
02:17:03.890 --> 02:17:07.720
You've got to care about your people.
That's what,
that's what moocs it.

2226
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:09.610
That's what,
that's what general mooky Alma said,

2227
02:17:09.611 --> 02:17:12.880
you got to care about your people.
I hundred percent agree.

2228
02:17:13.210 --> 02:17:14.920
Soldiers can endure hardship.

2229
02:17:15.670 --> 02:17:19.030
Most of their training is directed toward conditioning them for unusual

2230
02:17:19.031 --> 02:17:20.380
privation and exertion.

2231
02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:25.740
But no power on earth can reconcile them to what common sense says is

2232
02:17:26.050 --> 02:17:27.610
unnecessary hardship,

2233
02:17:27.850 --> 02:17:31.870
which might've been avoided by greater intelligence in their superiors.

2234
02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:37.610
That is awesome.
If you're,
your people will do all kinds of stuff,

2235
02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:39.190
take all kinds of punishment for you.

2236
02:17:40.090 --> 02:17:42.790
But if they see that there's a way you could of avoiding punishment for them and

2237
02:17:42.791 --> 02:17:45.310
you didn't do it,
cause you are dumb,
they're going to rebel against you.

2238
02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:50.200
The more intelligent,
the more intelligent the soldier,

2239
02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:54.390
the more likely it is that he will see as a sign.

2240
02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:57.970
See that as a sign of indiscipline up above,

2241
02:17:58.090 --> 02:17:59.770
and we'll answer it the same way.

2242
02:18:00.490 --> 02:18:02.680
So if the upper chain of commands dropping the ball,

2243
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:04.900
guess what's going to happen?
Lower Channel what?
We're dropping the ball too.

2244
02:18:05.890 --> 02:18:10.540
Nothing more radical is suggested here then that the leader who would make

2245
02:18:10.570 --> 02:18:15.550
certain of the fundamental soundness of his operation cannot do better than

2246
02:18:15.551 --> 02:18:18.340
concentrate his attention on his men.

2247
02:18:22.330 --> 02:18:25.930
That's a bold statement.
There's nothing better you can do.

2248
02:18:25.931 --> 02:18:28.510
Then concentrate your attention on your men.

2249
02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:31.030
If you want something to be successful,
concentrate on your people.

2250
02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:35.200
There is no other word for awhile road.

2251
02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:41.560
The di they dupe only themselves who believe that there is a brand of military

2252
02:18:41.561 --> 02:18:43.930
efficiency which consists in moving smartly,

2253
02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:48.280
expediting papers and achieving perfection in formations while at the same time

2254
02:18:48.281 --> 02:18:52.150
sliding or ignoring the human nature of those who may command

2255
02:18:53.850 --> 02:18:55.680
the art of leading and operations larger,

2256
02:18:55.681 --> 02:19:00.681
small as the art of dealing with humanity and working diligently on behalf of

2257
02:19:01.741 --> 02:19:02.280
men,

2258
02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:07.280
of being sympathetic with them but equally of insisting that they make a square

2259
02:19:07.921 --> 02:19:09.930
facing toward their own problems.

2260
02:19:10.170 --> 02:19:14.790
These are the real basis of commanders,
major calculations.

2261
02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.260
That's just a awesome,
that whole thing.
The Art of leading,

2262
02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:24.090
dealing with humanity,
working diligently on behalf of your men,

2263
02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:29.810
being sympathetic with them and at the same time dichotomy insisting that they

2264
02:19:29.811 --> 02:19:32.090
make a square facing toward their own problems.
Boom.

2265
02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:37.610
Men who've been in battle know from firsthand experience that when the chips are

2266
02:19:37.611 --> 02:19:40.820
down,
a man fights to help the man next to him,
him next to him.

2267
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:43.760
Just as a company fights to keep pace with its flanks,

2268
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:49.250
things have to be that simple and ideal does not become tangible at the moment

2269
02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:52.340
of firing a volley or charging a hill.

2270
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:59.120
Having already suggested that the thinking,

2271
02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:04.180
bayonets can never be subordinated by the routine methods of a discipline,

2272
02:20:04.311 --> 02:20:07.040
which is based largely in mechanical procedures.

2273
02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:11.060
I will add that no leader will ever fail his troops,

2274
02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:16.040
nor will they fail him.
Who leads them in respect for the discipline life

2275
02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:24.460
between these two things and discipline in itself and a personal faith in the

2276
02:20:24.801 --> 02:20:25.521
military,

2277
02:20:25.521 --> 02:20:30.521
value of discipline lies all the difference between military maturity and

2278
02:20:31.281 --> 02:20:32.114
mediocrity.

2279
02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:33.610
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2280
02:20:33.610 --> 02:20:34.720
<v 0>I'll salute from a willing,</v>

2281
02:20:34.780 --> 02:20:39.460
from an unwilling soldier is as meaningless as the moving of a leaf on a tree.

2282
02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:43.870
It is a sign only that the subject has been caught by a gust of wind,

2283
02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:48.100
but as salute from the man who takes pride in the gesture because he feels

2284
02:20:48.101 --> 02:20:49.570
privileged to wear the uniform.

2285
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:54.750
Having found this service good is an act of the highest military virtue.

2286
02:20:57.090 --> 02:20:57.923
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2287
02:20:58.060 --> 02:21:02.110
<v 0>One further fact that needs to be stressed about the character of those officers</v>

2288
02:21:02.111 --> 02:21:05.230
whose capacity could be measured in the efficiency of their companies.

2289
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:08.800
While they were scrupulous in the care of their men,

2290
02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:10.930
they were not wet nurses.

2291
02:21:11.730 --> 02:21:12.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2292
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:14.600
<v 0>They treated their subordinates as men.</v>

2293
02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:20.540
They did not regard them as adolescents and they did not employ the classroom

2294
02:21:20.541 --> 02:21:24.200
manner in dealing with them individually or in the mass.

2295
02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:26.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2296
02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:30.550
<v 0>That was an important part of their hold upon the men.</v>

2297
02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:35.110
The men prize,
a commander,
the more if he looks in acts,

2298
02:21:35.111 --> 02:21:36.250
the part of a soldier,

2299
02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:41.260
but the characteristic of a fine appearance will but betray him the sooner.

2300
02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:46.300
If he has no real kinship with the men.
So he does this dichotomy,

2301
02:21:46.450 --> 02:21:48.520
you've got to take care of him.
You're mad,
but you're not a wet nurse.

2302
02:21:50.450 --> 02:21:51.950
You don't treat them like little kids.

2303
02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:57.650
The characteristics which are required in the minor in the minor commander,

2304
02:21:57.651 --> 02:22:01.100
if he has to prove capable of preparing men for and leading them through the

2305
02:22:01.101 --> 02:22:03.200
shock of combat with high credit,

2306
02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:08.320
may therefore be briefly described as one diligence in the care of men.

2307
02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:12.230
So here's the characteristics.
Number one,
diligence in the care of men.

2308
02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:13.170
Number two,

2309
02:22:13.170 --> 02:22:17.450
administration of all organizational affairs such as punishments and promotions

2310
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:21.800
according to a standard of resolute justice.
Number three,

2311
02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:23.060
military bearing.

2312
02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:24.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2313
02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:25.850
<v 0>Number four,</v>

2314
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:31.340
<v 1>a basic understanding of the simple fact that soldiers wish to think of</v>

2315
02:22:31.341 --> 02:22:36.230
themselves as soldiers and that all military information is nourishing to their

2316
02:22:36.231 --> 02:22:38.360
spirits and their lives.

2317
02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:44.150
<v 0>Number five,
courage,
creative intelligence,</v>

2318
02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:45.950
and physical fitness.

2319
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2320
02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:48.870
<v 0>Number six,</v>

2321
02:22:49.140 --> 02:22:54.140
innate respect for the dignity of the position and the work of other men.

2322
02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:57.960
I'm going to tell you those are some good rules.

2323
02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:01.350
Some good things to think about if you're in a leadership position,

2324
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:08.000
here's a little commentary and it was written in 1947 might still be true today.

2325
02:23:09.241 --> 02:23:14.220
It is my belief that there is no more hurtful doctrine put before our people

2326
02:23:14.221 --> 02:23:14.910
today.

2327
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:19.440
Then that the army should duplicate the arrangements which obtained within the

2328
02:23:19.441 --> 02:23:24.240
civil society.
Slavish Lee imitating the ladders,
comforts,

2329
02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:29.360
social customs and ideas of regulating justice and insisting on no higher

2330
02:23:29.761 --> 02:23:32.250
standards of personal responsibility for its people.

2331
02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:35.400
So Hey,
guess what?

2332
02:23:35.850 --> 02:23:39.960
The military is not the civilian world and we shouldn't be trying to make it

2333
02:23:39.961 --> 02:23:42.060
that way.
The military is the military.

2334
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.310
That's a 1947 he saying that,

2335
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:53.220
I'm going to have to say I agree.
In my opinion,

2336
02:23:53.221 --> 02:23:54.990
and I do not say this lightly,

2337
02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:59.220
the fault in our disciplinary level during World War Two was not primarily that

2338
02:23:59.221 --> 02:24:01.890
the discipline of the ranks needed to be more relaxed,

2339
02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:06.240
but that the discipline of a considerable percentage of our officers needed to

2340
02:24:06.241 --> 02:24:09.060
be tightened for this simple reason.

2341
02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:12.840
In so far as his ability to mold the character of troops is concerned,

2342
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:17.910
the qualifying test of an officer is the judgment placed upon his soldierly

2343
02:24:17.911 --> 02:24:20.700
abilities by those who serve under him.

2344
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:30.460
You can only mold your troops if they judge you worthy of molding them.

2345
02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:32.140
Think about that for a minute.

2346
02:24:33.850 --> 02:24:38.620
If they do not deem him fit to command,
he cannot train them to obey

2347
02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:44.260
Voss.
Where slackness is tolerated in officer ship,

2348
02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:49.500
it is a direct invitation to disobedience and as disobedience multiplies,

2349
02:24:51.010 --> 02:24:53.350
all discipline disappears.

2350
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:59.850
I love,
I love this little section right here.

2351
02:24:59.910 --> 02:25:04.020
No officer can command unless he is certain of himself and confident that his

2352
02:25:04.021 --> 02:25:07.410
orders are likely to lead to success.
On the other hand,

2353
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:09.810
command does not create its own magic.

2354
02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:15.620
Men who are filled with the spirit of disobedience will break the heart and ruin

2355
02:25:15.691 --> 02:25:19.200
the character of the finest officer,
whoever lived,

2356
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:21.930
and you're going to deal with some rabble rousers out there.

2357
02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:24.220
We're going to deal some tough cookies.

2358
02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:25.263
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

2359
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:32.700
<v 0>The way in which the loss of moral incentive as reflected in the tactical</v>

2360
02:25:32.701 --> 02:25:36.870
behavior of troops was thoughtfully expressed many years ago by the British

2361
02:25:36.871 --> 02:25:39.330
teacher,
Colonel G F R Henderson.

2362
02:25:40.890 --> 02:25:44.070
When troops once realize their inferiority,
they can go,

2363
02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:49.050
they can no longer be dependent on if attacking.
They refuse to advance.

2364
02:25:49.051 --> 02:25:51.900
If defending,
they abandon all hope of resistance.

2365
02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:54.510
It is not the losses they have suffered,

2366
02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:58.110
but those they expect to suffer that affect them.
Consequently,

2367
02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.370
on less discipline,
a national spirit spirit are of superior quality,

2368
02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:06.060
and unless the soldier is animated by something higher than the habit of

2369
02:26:06.061 --> 02:26:07.410
mechanical obedience,

2370
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:12.590
panic shirking and wholesale surrender will be the ordinary features of the

2371
02:26:12.961 --> 02:26:13.794
campaign.

2372
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:16.370
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2373
02:26:16.370 --> 02:26:17.390
<v 0>Pretty harsh warning.</v>

2374
02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:23.560
Nothing more unfortunate can happen to the commander than to come to be regarded

2375
02:26:24.741 --> 02:26:29.660
by his subordinates as unapproachable for such a reputation isolates him from

2376
02:26:29.661 --> 02:26:33.110
the main problems of command as well as its chief rewards.

2377
02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:34.970
So you got to be approachable as a leader.

2378
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:38.950
They're saying there's nothing more unfortunate than being regarded as on

2379
02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:40.490
approachable.
It is.

2380
02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:43.730
Back to the book is never a waste of time for the commander to talk to his

2381
02:26:43.731 --> 02:26:45.140
people about their problems.

2382
02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:46.790
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2383
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:51.080
<v 0>Here's a good people ask me.
I get all the junior leaders from the military,</v>

2384
02:26:51.081 --> 02:26:53.210
from the civilian sector,
from everywhere,
and they asked me,

2385
02:26:53.211 --> 02:26:57.890
what am I supposed to do to the young officer who's conscious of his own reserve

2386
02:26:57.891 --> 02:26:59.660
and is anxious to do something about it?

2387
02:26:59.930 --> 02:27:04.580
I can suggest nothing better than to make a habit of full physical

2388
02:27:04.581 --> 02:27:05.570
participation.

2389
02:27:05.810 --> 02:27:10.810
That is instead of watching the squad or platoon work out a problem and either

2390
02:27:10.940 --> 02:27:14.540
directing or criticizing it's action,
let him pick up a weapon,

2391
02:27:14.690 --> 02:27:16.220
relieve one man in the group,

2392
02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:20.750
then let himself be the one commanded until the conclusion of the operation.

2393
02:27:21.770 --> 02:27:25.280
Is this course of contact beneath the dignity of the American officer?

2394
02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:30.080
Certainly not so good.
What was that as like getting the game get in the game?

2395
02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:35.770
In the United States service,

2396
02:27:35.771 --> 02:27:40.771
we are tending to forget because of the effective motorization that the higher

2397
02:27:41.171 --> 02:27:46.150
value of discipline of the road march in other days that it was,

2398
02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:50.620
that it wasn't that it hardened muscles,
but that short of combat,

2399
02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:54.370
it was the best method of separating the men from the boys.

2400
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:56.950
What was common was get back to a little road march action.

2401
02:27:57.790 --> 02:28:00.790
Best method for separating the men from the boys is the road march.

2402
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:05.770
This is true today,
despite all the new conditions imposed by high velocity,

2403
02:28:05.771 --> 02:28:08.050
warfare are hard.

2404
02:28:08.051 --> 02:28:11.680
Road March is the most satisfactory training test of the moral strength of the

2405
02:28:11.681 --> 02:28:12.550
individual man.

2406
02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:17.590
The great advantage of the gain in moral force through all forms of physical

2407
02:28:17.591 --> 02:28:20.890
training is that it is on an unconscious gain.

2408
02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.340
All Forms of physical training are going to give you an unconscious gain of

2409
02:28:25.341 --> 02:28:28.850
moral force.
Let that propel your workout tomorrow morning.

2410
02:28:29.780 --> 02:28:31.700
Willpower,
determination,

2411
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:35.930
mental poise and mental control all march hand in hand with the general health

2412
02:28:35.931 --> 02:28:37.220
and wellbeing of the man,

2413
02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:42.350
fatigue will beat men down as quickly as any other condition for four.

2414
02:28:42.351 --> 02:28:44.510
Fatigue brings fear with it.

2415
02:28:45.610 --> 02:28:46.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2416
02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:50.070
<v 0>There was no quicker way to lose a battle than to lose it on the road for lack</v>

2417
02:28:50.071 --> 02:28:52.560
of adequate preliminary hardening and troops.

2418
02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:57.270
Such a condition cannot be redeemed by the resolve of a commander who insists on

2419
02:28:57.271 --> 02:29:01.170
driving troops and extra mile beyond their general level of physical endurance.

2420
02:29:01.310 --> 02:29:05.130
I,
that's important to remember you.
If you've got people that aren't ready,

2421
02:29:05.210 --> 02:29:08.250
it doesn't matter how much you try and make them do something,

2422
02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:12.210
they're not physically capable of doing it.
That's the reality.

2423
02:29:13.730 --> 02:29:14.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2424
02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:19.160
<v 0>Extremes of this sort make men rebellious and hateful of the command and thus</v>

2425
02:29:19.161 --> 02:29:22.940
strike at the tactical efficiency from two directions at once.

2426
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2427
02:29:24.310 --> 02:29:25.990
<v 0>For when men resent a commander,</v>

2428
02:29:25.991 --> 02:29:29.650
they will not fight as willingly for him and when their bodies are spent,

2429
02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:34.480
their nerves are gone.
In this state,
the soldiers,
every act is mechanical.

2430
02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:39.540
He's reduced to that automatism of mind which destroys physical response.

2431
02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:43.690
His courage,
his killed his intellect,
falls asleep.
Truly.

2432
02:29:43.691 --> 02:29:48.691
Then it is killing men with kindness not to insist upon physical standards

2433
02:29:49.751 --> 02:29:51.520
during training,
during training,

2434
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:56.620
which will give them a maximum fitness for the extraordinary stresses of

2435
02:29:56.650 --> 02:29:58.360
campaigning in a war.

2436
02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:00.173
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2437
02:30:00.180 --> 02:30:04.980
<v 0>killing men truly killing men with kindness not to have them physically ready as</v>

2438
02:30:04.981 --> 02:30:05.960
the body is hardened,

2439
02:30:05.970 --> 02:30:09.690
so must the mind be steadily informed so that the soldier will take a reasoning

2440
02:30:09.691 --> 02:30:13.560
view not only of the privations of the field but of that which is being

2441
02:30:13.561 --> 02:30:14.340
attempted.

2442
02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:18.720
Once we depart from the ideal of automatic response as the condition most likely

2443
02:30:18.721 --> 02:30:20.490
to produce unity of action in battle,

2444
02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:25.140
the only substitute for it lies in the possibility that more and more men in the

2445
02:30:25.141 --> 02:30:30.141
ranks can be trained to see and think through the haze of battle in unison with

2446
02:30:31.021 --> 02:30:35.540
their commanders.
You can see,
you can see,

2447
02:30:35.541 --> 02:30:38.330
I mean when you read about face,
there's Hackworth,

2448
02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:41.390
Hackworth did Madison how Hackworth rolled.

2449
02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:45.130
<v 1>Hmm?
The fact,</v>

2450
02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:47.690
<v 0>the book,</v>

2451
02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:52.690
why is the will of the military commander deemed more decisive of success than

2452
02:30:53.181 --> 02:30:57.200
the will of leadership in any other calling?
Clearly it is because the inertia,

2453
02:30:57.290 --> 02:31:02.120
frictions and confusions of the forces of the battlefield make all positive

2454
02:31:02.121 --> 02:31:03.590
action more difficult.

2455
02:31:05.330 --> 02:31:10.330
And yet the principles which when intelligent man to man cooperation apply

2456
02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:12.530
equally in all circumstances,

2457
02:31:12.860 --> 02:31:17.150
the same rules work on the battlefield as in an office

2458
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:20.930
that's,
we got a little something called echelon front.

2459
02:31:23.940 --> 02:31:26.040
The wheel does not offer,
you operate in a vacuum.

2460
02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:30.330
It can not be imposed successfully if it runs counter to reason.

2461
02:31:30.570 --> 02:31:34.230
Things are not done wore primarily because a man wills it,

2462
02:31:35.430 --> 02:31:37.830
they are done because they are doable.
Okay.

2463
02:31:37.831 --> 02:31:42.831
This is a really important little section and you know,

2464
02:31:43.471 --> 02:31:46.490
I,
I,
you know,
I talk about force of Wilson,

2465
02:31:46.491 --> 02:31:50.370
but you've got to make something happen for a will.
But there's a very important,

2466
02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:54.060
of course,
the caveat to that and we're about to get into this caveat.

2467
02:31:54.390 --> 02:31:58.050
So to say that again,
things not done in war.

2468
02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:00.990
Things are not done in war primarily because a man wills it.

2469
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:03.240
They're done because they are doable.

2470
02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:08.460
The limits for the commander in battle or defined by the general circumstance

2471
02:32:08.670 --> 02:32:13.670
when he asks what he asks of his men must be consistent with the possibilities

2472
02:32:14.281 --> 02:32:17.700
of the situation.
That might seem like common sense,
right?
Hey,

2473
02:32:17.730 --> 02:32:20.250
I can't ask you to do anything that cannot be done.
Yeah.

2474
02:32:22.110 --> 02:32:22.890
Back to the book.

2475
02:32:22.890 --> 02:32:27.890
What can be successfully willed must first be clearly seen and understood.

2476
02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:30.270
If amid the confusion of battle,

2477
02:32:30.271 --> 02:32:32.880
the commander sees what is required by the situation.

2478
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:37.110
If amid the miscarriage of arrangements and rest sailing doubts of other men,

2479
02:32:37.111 --> 02:32:41.790
he measures the means of doing it and if he then gives his order and holds his

2480
02:32:41.791 --> 02:32:42.690
men to their duty,

2481
02:32:42.930 --> 02:32:47.930
this is the ultimate triumph of the will on the battlefield to reflect on this

2482
02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:53.840
thought is to note that he exercises his will far less upon his men than upon

2483
02:32:55.171 --> 02:32:59.080
himself
should he,

2484
02:32:59.290 --> 02:33:00.850
on the other hand,

2485
02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:06.180
attempt to wheel that which is men know cannot be done or feel unanimously is

2486
02:33:07.390 --> 02:33:12.250
utterly beyond reason or should he base his order on assumptions which they

2487
02:33:12.251 --> 02:33:17.251
recognize as false is will becomes temporarily without power and cannot help the

2488
02:33:19.181 --> 02:33:24.070
situation.
This is one of those things where people think,
I'm just gonna,

2489
02:33:24.250 --> 02:33:27.310
I'm gonna tell him to do it and we'll see what they can get done.
Right?
Like,
no,

2490
02:33:27.311 --> 02:33:28.860
they're not going to,
they're going to see that they can't do it.

2491
02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:29.411
They're just going to say,

2492
02:33:29.411 --> 02:33:33.820
we're not going to be to try to make your goals realistic,
make them not,

2493
02:33:33.821 --> 02:33:35.980
not just realistical make them achievable.

2494
02:33:38.980 --> 02:33:43.980
There is scarcely any commander with any time in combat,

2495
02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:50.280
but has had his experience of having willing troops become suddenly unresponsive

2496
02:33:50.530 --> 02:33:52.930
because his facts were not straight.

2497
02:33:55.060 --> 02:33:57.580
So sometimes the troops aren't going to do what you want to do even though you

2498
02:33:57.581 --> 02:34:00.190
have this strong wheel they're not going to do.
Why is that?
Here we go.

2499
02:34:00.430 --> 02:34:05.430
It happened to Lieutenant Colonel Hwl Canard during the night advance of first

2500
02:34:06.761 --> 02:34:11.761
battalion 501st parachute infantry against the German hell Dutch village in

2501
02:34:13.271 --> 02:34:16.840
September,
1944 the village of Shin Jill,

2502
02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:22.150
which I have praised elsewhere in this book,

2503
02:34:22.151 --> 02:34:25.390
is one of the most brilliant battalion actions of the war.

2504
02:34:27.730 --> 02:34:32.730
The column had advanced only 500 yards beyond it's outpost line.

2505
02:34:32.771 --> 02:34:37.420
When it came under machine gun and anti tank fire canard heard some of the fire

2506
02:34:37.421 --> 02:34:40.510
clipping the branches of the tree above his head and judged.

2507
02:34:40.511 --> 02:34:42.400
It was all going high,

2508
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:46.930
but the lead company had stopped and the men had jumped for the ditches.

2509
02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:52.030
He ran forward shouting to the men.
Keep going,
keep going.
That fire is high,

2510
02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:56.780
but it's personal.
Advanced had no effect,
not a man stirred.

2511
02:34:57.890 --> 02:35:02.510
So this is an incredibly like seasoned,

2512
02:35:03.050 --> 02:35:03.883
tough,

2513
02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:08.870
well trained group and he's telling him and he's personally leading them forward

2514
02:35:08.871 --> 02:35:13.220
st cold call.
We got to go.
Don't worry that fires high,
but it has no effect,

2515
02:35:13.221 --> 02:35:14.780
not a man stirred back to the book.

2516
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:19.160
Within a moment he understood why he had failed from one of the ditches.

2517
02:35:19.161 --> 02:35:23.630
A rifleman answered him.
If you think the fire is high,
colonel,
come over here.

2518
02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:26.240
We've had eight men hitting the legs.

2519
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:33.510
So you've got to think about what is actually possible.

2520
02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:39.730
The supreme trial of the commander in war lies in his ability to overcome the

2521
02:35:39.731 --> 02:35:43.090
weaknesses of human nature in the face of danger,

2522
02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:48.480
and these are the matters which he cannot know in full unless he has served with

2523
02:35:48.911 --> 02:35:50.620
men where danger lies.

2524
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.983
Check

2525
02:35:56.910 --> 02:35:59.460
chapter 12 men under fire.

2526
02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:02.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2527
02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:04.240
<v 0>To those that have known the firing line,</v>

2528
02:36:04.241 --> 02:36:08.860
it would scarcely be necessary to point out that morale and combat is never a

2529
02:36:08.861 --> 02:36:10.210
steady current force,

2530
02:36:10.211 --> 02:36:14.350
but a rapidly oscillating wave who's variations are both in measurable and

2531
02:36:14.351 --> 02:36:15.184
unpredictable.

2532
02:36:15.970 --> 02:36:16.780
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2533
02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:18.520
<v 0>It is in this respect,</v>

2534
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:23.550
chiefly the rapidity and capriciousness of its variations that the morale,

2535
02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:27.040
that the morale problem in the zone of fire differs from that.

2536
02:36:27.610 --> 02:36:30.100
From that of a rear area soldiering,

2537
02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:33.340
a band of men go may go through a terrible engagement,

2538
02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:38.460
take its losses bravely and then become holy demoralized in the hour in which it

2539
02:36:38.741 --> 02:36:43.080
must bury its own dead.
A regimen,
Fred,

2540
02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:47.970
to utter objection by a protracted stay in the lines may find it's fighting

2541
02:36:47.971 --> 02:36:49.590
spirit again in a six hour,

2542
02:36:49.591 --> 02:36:53.040
a spite during which the men are deloused and giving a chance.

2543
02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:54.420
Given a change of underwear,

2544
02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:00.680
a battalion advancing boldly may be brought in check because it's commander did

2545
02:37:00.991 --> 02:37:05.490
the disservice of going too far forward and getting himself killed within sight

2546
02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:10.020
of the ranks.
A platoon may charge and capture an enemy.

2547
02:37:10.021 --> 02:37:15.021
Hell Elle Hil losing half its numbers and doing so then run down the hill again

2548
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:19.940
because one of its own artillery shells landed to close and hit one man

2549
02:37:21.620 --> 02:37:26.620
so that the morale of the troops is constantly at at risk of going up or going

2550
02:37:29.031 --> 02:37:33.070
down
the near presence of death.

2551
02:37:33.071 --> 02:37:35.830
And the prospect of meeting it at the next moment.

2552
02:37:35.831 --> 02:37:40.360
Movement and mirror many curious and contrary ways.
Many men,

2553
02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:43.900
many men seem to change character under the guns.

2554
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:50.230
The life of hardship and of danger gives new strength to the truly strong and

2555
02:37:50.411 --> 02:37:52.540
greater weakness to the truly week.

2556
02:37:54.090 --> 02:37:55.860
So combat is going to have an effect on people.

2557
02:37:56.190 --> 02:37:58.740
It's going to amplify their situation.

2558
02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:07.760
What normal man would deny that some of the fullest and Ferris days of his life

2559
02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:13.640
have been spent at the front or that the sky ever seems more blue or the air,

2560
02:38:14.191 --> 02:38:18.390
more bracing than when there is just a hint of danger in the air.

2561
02:38:20.270 --> 02:38:23.810
This is an important thing for leaders to understand.

2562
02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:28.160
The man who cannot bring himself to trust the judgment in good faith of other

2563
02:38:28.161 --> 02:38:30.530
men cannot command very long.

2564
02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:34.940
He will soon break under the unnecessary strain he puts on himself.

2565
02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:39.470
Sleeplessness,
nervous irritation and loss of self control will be his

2566
02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:45.830
will be his lot until he is at last found totally unfit.

2567
02:38:46.430 --> 02:38:51.260
The ideal relationship between a commander and his subordinate is nowhere better

2568
02:38:51.261 --> 02:38:55.550
illustrated than in a passage from the letter of instruction.
We're in.

2569
02:38:55.551 --> 02:39:00.551
Grant told ship Sherman to proceed to the destruction of Johnson's army.

2570
02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:02.720
Quote,

2571
02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:07.720
I do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign but simply to lay down

2572
02:39:08.211 --> 02:39:13.211
the work it is desirable to have done and leave you free to execute it in your

2573
02:39:13.941 --> 02:39:18.260
own way.
Some decentralized command right there.

2574
02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:26.170
This is another good one.
When a company has stopped by physical shock,

2575
02:39:26.171 --> 02:39:29.380
restoration of its movement becomes a problem for the battalion.

2576
02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:32.770
When a company is stopped by psychological shock,

2577
02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:37.920
the continuing of the advanced remains the problem of the company commander and

2578
02:39:38.231 --> 02:39:39.064
here's some advanced,

2579
02:39:39.090 --> 02:39:42.790
some examples of that diffusion of the company over to wide a sector or

2580
02:39:42.791 --> 02:39:46.030
retrograde movement by supporting weapons such as Armour,

2581
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:50.830
the death of a well loved officer,
light losses from friendly supporting fire,

2582
02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:55.960
the appearance of some new and unexpected weapon in the enemy sector to a few of

2583
02:39:55.961 --> 02:39:57.850
the causes of psychological shock.

2584
02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.000
The local treatments are as many and as varied as are the diseases with respect

2585
02:40:04.001 --> 02:40:06.280
to the effect of friendly fire hitting among troops.

2586
02:40:06.281 --> 02:40:10.570
However it is to be observed that if circumstances leave any room for doubt as

2587
02:40:10.571 --> 02:40:12.790
to the source,
the men will jump to the,

2588
02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:15.930
that they are being victimized by their own guns.

2589
02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:17.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2590
02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:23.120
<v 0>It is in instances where it is unmistakable that they have been hurt by their</v>

2591
02:40:23.121 --> 02:40:26.630
own fire.
However,
the commander is ill advised to lie to them.

2592
02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:30.020
They will usually learn the truth later on and when they do,

2593
02:40:30.021 --> 02:40:31.910
it strikes a blow to his prestige.

2594
02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:37.490
The experience combat soldier knows that such occasional accidents are part of

2595
02:40:37.491 --> 02:40:39.230
battle and he accepts them as such,

2596
02:40:39.620 --> 02:40:43.850
but he cannot make any good judgment to the realization that his commander is

2597
02:40:43.851 --> 02:40:45.800
either a fool or a liar.

2598
02:40:46.820 --> 02:40:47.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2599
02:40:47.370 --> 02:40:52.370
<v 0>No gain ever comes from being slick with troops from acting deviously instead of</v>

2600
02:40:52.501 --> 02:40:57.450
forthrightly from posing as having superior knowledge or from being secretive or

2601
02:40:57.451 --> 02:41:01.590
discounting the common sense of the majority.
See,
a lot of people do that.

2602
02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:03.420
They discount the common sense.

2603
02:41:03.810 --> 02:41:06.780
They think they're going to get away with that with with trying to bullshit the

2604
02:41:06.781 --> 02:41:08.100
troops and it doesn't work.

2605
02:41:10.090 --> 02:41:10.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2606
02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:15.340
<v 0>The most common cause of psychological shock,
however,
is partial victory.</v>

2607
02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:20.140
The adage that the weakest point follow success is a fundamental truth of minor

2608
02:41:20.141 --> 02:41:25.141
tactics and the danger is always greatest when success is to easily one.

2609
02:41:25.810 --> 02:41:30.670
Success is disarming.
Tension is the normal state of mind and body in combat.

2610
02:41:30.850 --> 02:41:34.990
When the tension suddenly relaxes through the winning of a first objective,

2611
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:40.110
troops are apt to be pervaded by a sense of extreme wellbeing and there is apt

2612
02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:46.240
to ensue laxness in all its forms and with all its dangerous

2613
02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:51.760
he he hammers this home.

2614
02:41:51.761 --> 02:41:56.290
It might be well to speak of the importance of enthusiasm,
kindness,

2615
02:41:56.530 --> 02:41:57.970
courtesy and justice,

2616
02:41:57.971 --> 02:42:01.840
which are the safeguards of honor and the tokens of mutual spec respect between

2617
02:42:01.841 --> 02:42:04.630
man and man.
This last,

2618
02:42:04.631 --> 02:42:08.230
there must be if they are to go forward together,

2619
02:42:08.470 --> 02:42:12.900
prosper in one another's company and find strength in the bonds of mutual x

2620
02:42:12.901 --> 02:42:17.680
service and experience a common philosophy in the relationship between the

2621
02:42:17.681 --> 02:42:21.190
leader and the lead.
Loyalty is the big thing,

2622
02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:23.380
the greatest battle asset of all,

2623
02:42:23.650 --> 02:42:28.650
but no man ever wins the loyalty of troops by preaching loyalty.

2624
02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:37.590
No Man ever wins the loyalty of troops by preaching loyalty.

2625
02:42:38.810 --> 02:42:43.810
It is given him by them as he proves his possession of the other virtues.

2626
02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:49.890
The doctrine of a blind loyalty to leadership is a selfish,

2627
02:42:49.891 --> 02:42:54.891
a few tile military dogma except in so far as it is ennobled by a higher loyalty

2628
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:58.950
in all ranks to truth and decency.

2629
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.903
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2630
02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:06.060
<v 0>War is to war is much too brutal a business to have room for brutal leading in</v>

2631
02:43:07.121 --> 02:43:07.870
the end.

2632
02:43:07.870 --> 02:43:12.610
It's only effect can be to corrode the character men and when character has

2633
02:43:12.611 --> 02:43:14.590
lost,
all is lost.

2634
02:43:16.530 --> 02:43:21.360
The bully and the sadist serve only to further encumber and army.

2635
02:43:21.690 --> 02:43:25.350
Their subordinates must waste precious time clearing away the wreckage that they

2636
02:43:25.351 --> 02:43:26.184
make.

2637
02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:31.200
The good company has no place for the officer who would rather be right than

2638
02:43:31.201 --> 02:43:36.201
beloved for the time will quickly come when he walks alone and in battle.

2639
02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:42.570
No Man may succeed in solitude.
That's worth repeating.

2640
02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:48.240
The good company has no place for the off for officer who would rather be right

2641
02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:52.230
than beloved.
We talked about that when Jordan was on it.
Man,

2642
02:43:52.231 --> 02:43:55.530
you don't need to be right when you're dealing with your significant other.
No,

2643
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:57.000
that's not important.

2644
02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:04.020
I have known a few brutes in battle whose talents were so limited that they

2645
02:44:04.021 --> 02:44:07.290
could know try no other means of command than the abusive men.

2646
02:44:08.250 --> 02:44:11.460
But I have yet to see one who did a good job of holding his command together.

2647
02:44:11.461 --> 02:44:13.650
When the going became rough and in the ranks,

2648
02:44:13.651 --> 02:44:17.280
fear of the enemy began to eclipse fear of the man up top.

2649
02:44:19.250 --> 02:44:21.410
Now here comes the dichotomy

2650
02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:27.210
because he's talking about all these kindness and courtesy and justice and then

2651
02:44:27.211 --> 02:44:30.960
he says ruggedness,
ruggedness,
toughness.
Ah,

2652
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:33.000
these are quite different things.

2653
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:38.510
So long as they are only the outer reflection of an inner determination and so

2654
02:44:39.061 --> 02:44:43.980
long as the inner fire is tempered by a heart having real compassion for men,

2655
02:44:44.430 --> 02:44:46.710
these are the best hands for the business.

2656
02:44:47.790 --> 02:44:51.270
They will win the hearts of other men and will stimulate their valor.

2657
02:44:51.450 --> 02:44:56.450
These others will try to be like them for it is a truth not to be denied.

2658
02:44:57.180 --> 02:45:02.180
That the rugged way is the natural way in battle dichotomy right there.

2659
02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:08.270
It tells this quick story.
There comes to mind.

2660
02:45:08.271 --> 02:45:11.920
One last picture from the same campaign.

2661
02:45:12.850 --> 02:45:16.180
The scene is stonewalled Fort Mont Berry.

2662
02:45:16.510 --> 02:45:20.770
The last obstacle bar barring entry into breast.

2663
02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:26.700
A battalion of the hundred 16th Infantry Regiment under Major Tom Dallas has had

2664
02:45:27.431 --> 02:45:30.040
the fort invested for three days,

2665
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:34.660
but the defenders have withdrawn to within the inner walls and will not

2666
02:45:34.661 --> 02:45:37.390
surrender.
The infantry flyer can not get at them.

2667
02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:41.410
The ports had been flamed but without visible effect.
Finally,

2668
02:45:41.530 --> 02:45:45.460
Dallas acts for three tons of TNT to blow the walls.

2669
02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:49.270
He has given one ton assisted by the infantry.

2670
02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:53.410
The engineer's lay the charge in a gallery under the wall.

2671
02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:58.660
The work completed.
Dallas is ready to give the orders.

2672
02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:05.180
Then he remembers on the night before the battalion had attacked and Lieutenant

2673
02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.910
Derwood see settles had been killed in the moat.

2674
02:46:10.390 --> 02:46:12.340
There been no chance to recover the body.

2675
02:46:13.590 --> 02:46:17.010
It is still there and will be crushed by the falling masonry.

2676
02:46:18.410 --> 02:46:18.970
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2677
02:46:18.970 --> 02:46:23.560
<v 0>so the demolition is held up and Dallas asks for a volunteer to go down to the</v>

2678
02:46:23.561 --> 02:46:26.200
moat under fire and bring out the body.

2679
02:46:27.570 --> 02:46:28.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2680
02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.310
<v 0>Our young lieutenant named Kelton response.</v>

2681
02:46:31.570 --> 02:46:32.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2682
02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:34.930
<v 0>In a few minutes,
Kelton returns with his burden,</v>

2683
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.610
<v 1>okay?</v>

2684
02:46:36.610 --> 02:46:39.640
<v 0>He says to Dallas,
we already now</v>

2685
02:46:41.610 --> 02:46:45.930
Dallas replies,
ready then blow them all to hell.

2686
02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:52.420
The charge goes off.
The earth shakes.
The walls collapsed with a roar.

2687
02:46:54.130 --> 02:46:56.740
There is a stunned silence from within the fort.

2688
02:46:58.310 --> 02:47:03.310
Dallas stands there for a few seconds and the tears fall as he looks down at the

2689
02:47:03.681 --> 02:47:06.290
body of his dead officer.

2690
02:47:07.980 --> 02:47:08.800
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2691
02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:10.380
<v 0>and that is loyalty.</v>

2692
02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:14.313
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2693
02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:17.810
<v 0>close this out with a couple more things.
In every action,</v>

2694
02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:22.870
larger small is decided by what happens up there on the line with where men take

2695
02:47:23.961 --> 02:47:26.600
the final chance of life or death.

2696
02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:31.910
Though I would not for a moment contend that modern war can be fought and won

2697
02:47:31.911 --> 02:47:34.460
without vigorous thought and action on the home front.

2698
02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:39.740
I deny absolutely that these things can vouch safe military victory any more now

2699
02:47:40.100 --> 02:47:43.970
than in the days when men fought with spears and crossbows,

2700
02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:49.790
any who look at war and think otherwise are siting through the wrong end of the

2701
02:47:49.791 --> 02:47:50.624
telescope.

2702
02:47:51.700 --> 02:47:52.280
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2703
02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:55.470
<v 0>They have become deceived by the vastness of vastness of the national</v>

2704
02:47:55.471 --> 02:47:56.304
preparation,

2705
02:47:56.550 --> 02:48:00.090
how differently they would see things if it became their duty to measure the

2706
02:48:00.091 --> 02:48:04.200
thin margins between victory and defeat on the field itself.

2707
02:48:05.250 --> 02:48:05.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
02:48:05.730 --> 02:48:10.140
<v 0>The great victories of the United States have pivoted on the acts of courage and</v>

2709
02:48:10.141 --> 02:48:12.900
intelligence of a very few individuals.

2710
02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:13.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2711
02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:18.420
<v 0>The time always comes in battle when the decisions of statesmen and of general</v>

2712
02:48:18.630 --> 02:48:23.630
generals can no longer affect the issue and when it is not within the power of

2713
02:48:23.851 --> 02:48:27.030
our national wealth to change the balance decisively.

2714
02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:30.990
Victory is never achieved prior to that point.

2715
02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:36.120
It can only be one after the battle has been delivered into the hands of men who

2716
02:48:36.121 --> 02:48:38.940
move in.
Imminent danger of death.

2717
02:48:41.740 --> 02:48:46.740
Courage is the real driving force in human affairs and that every worthwhile

2718
02:48:47.201 --> 02:48:52.201
action comes of some man daring what others fear to attempt.

2719
02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:55.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2720
02:48:55.260 --> 02:49:00.090
<v 0>The man who is willing to fight for his country is finally is finally the full</v>

2721
02:49:00.091 --> 02:49:01.790
custodian of it security.

2722
02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:04.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2723
02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:05.420
<v 0>If there were no willing men,</v>

2724
02:49:05.660 --> 02:49:10.320
no power in government could ever rally the masses of the unwilling.

2725
02:49:13.370 --> 02:49:17.240
Two men who have been long in battle and have thought about it deeply.

2726
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:22.990
There comes at lastly awareness of this ultimate responsibility that one man

2727
02:49:23.511 --> 02:49:28.100
must go ahead
so that a nation may live.

2728
02:49:32.940 --> 02:49:37.940
And so the final and greatest reality that national strength lies only in the

2729
02:49:39.841 --> 02:49:42.150
hearts and spirits of men.

2730
02:49:44.970 --> 02:49:46.620
The army,
navy,

2731
02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:50.100
and air force are not the guardians of its national security.

2732
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:56.780
The tremendous problem of the future is beyond their capacity to solve.

2733
02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:03.960
The search begins at the cradle where the mother makes the decision either to

2734
02:50:04.841 --> 02:50:06.130
tie her child

2735
02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.320
<v 1>okay</v>

2736
02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:11.550
<v 0>to her apron strings or to rear him as a man.</v>

2737
02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:18.260
It continues through years of schooling when children are taught either to place

2738
02:50:18.261 --> 02:50:19.760
personal interests,
opera,

2739
02:50:19.761 --> 02:50:24.650
most or to think in terms of their responsibility toward their society,

2740
02:50:25.370 --> 02:50:30.220
their country,
and all of mankind.

2741
02:50:31.870 --> 02:50:33.610
And there you go.

2742
02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:41.200
Strength lies in the hearts and spirits of men.

2743
02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:44.933
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2744
02:50:45.130 --> 02:50:50.130
<v 0>And freedom lies in the courage and the discipline of daring to attempt what</v>

2745
02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:54.640
augers fear.

2746
02:51:01.410 --> 02:51:06.410
And I think that that reflects not just the strength and freedom of nations

2747
02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:13.770
of countries,
but also of individuals.

2748
02:51:17.350 --> 02:51:21.220
We are ultimately responsible for ourselves.

2749
02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:25.480
For our own freedom,
for our own security,
it is on us.

2750
02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:30.190
And I think that is one of the,

2751
02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:36.420
one of the most valuable lessons to learn from Sla Marshall.

2752
02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:42.690
And,
you know,
unwillingly,
he also taught us a lesson

2753
02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:48.300
about being truthful and honest,
which he was not.

2754
02:51:51.020 --> 02:51:51.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2755
02:51:52.170 --> 02:51:55.770
<v 0>And had he listened to some of his own teachings,</v>

2756
02:51:55.950 --> 02:52:00.600
he might not have made that mistake to tarnish his reputation.
It's not worth it.

2757
02:52:03.350 --> 02:52:05.000
He failed to listen to his own lesson.

2758
02:52:09.820 --> 02:52:13.900
<v 3>And maybe that's the last thing we learned is that we don't just,
don't,</v>

2759
02:52:15.010 --> 02:52:17.680
just don't talk the talk,
just don't preach,

2760
02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:26.080
but walk the walk and live the life live correctly and follow the rules that

2761
02:52:30.561 --> 02:52:32.630
you've set for yourself.

2762
02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:37.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2763
02:52:37.790 --> 02:52:42.790
<v 3>And then you go and you live with the courage and the strength and the</v>

2764
02:52:43.011 --> 02:52:43.880
discipline.

2765
02:52:46.590 --> 02:52:47.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2766
02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:48.450
<v 3>So that you</v>

2767
02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:54.810
can truly free your mind.

2768
02:52:57.880 --> 02:53:02.370
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
Echo Charles.

2769
02:53:02.610 --> 02:53:06.400
Yes.
So speaking of,
uh,

2770
02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:12.820
strength and discipline and walking the walk and walking the walk and living the

2771
02:53:12.951 --> 02:53:14.660
life,
staying on the path,

2772
02:53:16.310 --> 02:53:21.310
maybe you've got some things that could help us uphold the personal standards

2773
02:53:23.390 --> 02:53:28.220
that we set for ourselves.
Yes,
I do.
I can,
I will.

2774
02:53:29.630 --> 02:53:33.440
SLA Marshall taught us a lesson he didn't want to teach us about that,
didn't he?

2775
02:53:33.740 --> 02:53:37.070
Yeah.
You know,
it's one of those things where I was kind of getting into it,

2776
02:53:37.071 --> 02:53:41.510
you know,
like on my cat.
Dang.
Yeah,
true.
That's true.
Yeah.
That's,
and then look,

2777
02:53:41.511 --> 02:53:44.960
came like how you mentioned before,
I'm like,
wait,
but this guy,
but then you know,

2778
02:53:44.961 --> 02:53:48.000
it's like,
it's the,
it's the dichotomy.
It's a dichotomy.

2779
02:53:48.001 --> 02:53:52.460
It's an unfortunate dichotomy.
Yeah.
See that's our man.
If this guy,

2780
02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:53.841
if this guy,

2781
02:53:53.841 --> 02:53:57.020
if we just knew about as normal at military record and you never said he didn't

2782
02:53:57.021 --> 02:54:00.620
have those stuff,
this would have so much more impact.
Yeah.

2783
02:54:00.920 --> 02:54:05.660
The fact that he lied,
just,
just,
it just hurts it.

2784
02:54:05.810 --> 02:54:09.500
It's all there is to,
it jammed him up as,
as Echo Charles would say.
No,

2785
02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:11.810
but you know if you can,

2786
02:54:12.110 --> 02:54:17.110
how as it were not throw the baby out with the bath water.

2787
02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:21.020
Yeah.
There's some good stuff in there.
Yeah.

2788
02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:26.140
I'll tell you what is possible is for us to stay on the path and in that path on

2789
02:54:26.271 --> 02:54:31.000
that path is Jujitsu of course.
Right.
Better for,

2790
02:54:31.030 --> 02:54:33.160
she'd be,
she'd be in my opinion,

2791
02:54:33.180 --> 02:54:35.900
you are actually said today that that was one quarter of your life.

2792
02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:40.790
It is in your life.
One quarter of the things you do is Jujitsu.

2793
02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:43.670
Yup.
I'll have of the total things that I do y'all.
Yeah.

2794
02:54:44.510 --> 02:54:47.270
Important things because there's things that aren't on that list.

2795
02:54:47.271 --> 02:54:48.440
Like going to the grocery store.

2796
02:54:48.620 --> 02:54:52.580
Well going in the grocery store does facilitate one of the other things in my

2797
02:54:52.581 --> 02:54:55.490
life.
See what I'm saying?
Okay.
It's not one of the things.

2798
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:59.420
It is not one of the things.
No.
That's like saying breathing,
you know.

2799
02:54:59.510 --> 02:55:01.640
Well broad breathing's not a party life.
Well yeah,

2800
02:55:01.641 --> 02:55:04.160
but it facilitates other things.
He see what I'm saying?
Okay,

2801
02:55:04.161 --> 02:55:08.660
so if that's the case,
does origin facilitate Jujitsu?

2802
02:55:08.700 --> 02:55:10.940
Yes sir.
It does.
Which is good.
Right?

2803
02:55:11.290 --> 02:55:16.010
You got to eat food and you've got to have origin.
Yes.
Check big time.
Okay,

2804
02:55:16.011 --> 02:55:18.380
so origin.
Okay.
Origin main.com.

2805
02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:22.160
This is where you can get your geek for Jujitsu.
If you haven't got one already,

2806
02:55:22.250 --> 02:55:23.083
go get one.

2807
02:55:23.150 --> 02:55:27.330
There is people out there who don't know any other gay except for origin game.

2808
02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:32.360
Actually someone contacted me.
It was like,
Hey,
I realize,
um,

2809
02:55:32.450 --> 02:55:35.540
you know,
origin is the gate again,
but before I buy one,

2810
02:55:35.541 --> 02:55:38.300
would you consider donating one to my cause?

2811
02:55:38.810 --> 02:55:41.510
I think they're like saving up for one.
You know,
cause sometimes that's how,

2812
02:55:41.511 --> 02:55:43.010
you know,
you save up for your gear,
whatever.

2813
02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:46.430
So I'm thinking on one hand the dichotomy.
Sure.

2814
02:55:46.970 --> 02:55:50.930
I'm never using these other keys again.
I wouldn't,
but on the other hand,

2815
02:55:50.931 --> 02:55:55.931
why would I want to bestow a substandard Gilkey onto someone's just starting by

2816
02:55:56.811 --> 02:56:00.760
the way.
Oh.
So it's like boom,
they got that.
But then again,
uh,
I'll,

2817
02:56:01.010 --> 02:56:04.220
I'll probably will assuming that the size,
you know,
all right,

2818
02:56:04.221 --> 02:56:05.990
well that's neither here nor there.
Nonetheless,

2819
02:56:05.991 --> 02:56:10.370
the point is if you want to get a good geek all made in America various types

2820
02:56:10.371 --> 02:56:14.260
option when we were in Maine.
And so after the camp was over,

2821
02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:15.980
Pete and I were at the factory.

2822
02:56:15.981 --> 02:56:19.580
We were just getting stuff done and planning and everything,

2823
02:56:19.850 --> 02:56:24.530
but he went into depth on weaving the fabric on the loom and everything,

2824
02:56:25.070 --> 02:56:28.550
Bro.
Crazy.

2825
02:56:28.910 --> 02:56:33.290
I've got full understanding though.
Yeah.
And it's awesome.
Yeah.

2826
02:56:33.291 --> 02:56:37.430
It's awesome to see.
It's interesting to see,
to watch Pete get into it.

2827
02:56:37.460 --> 02:56:40.360
Just let them go for,
Oh man,
this,

2828
02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:44.290
that's why these things are like so dope when you look at them.

2829
02:56:44.291 --> 02:56:45.890
And so that's why,

2830
02:56:46.010 --> 02:56:51.010
that's why the company is where it is without that passion for him,

2831
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:54.980
for the team.
Like when you talk to anyone on the team at origin,

2832
02:56:54.981 --> 02:56:57.880
they're like wanting of this stuff to be awesome.
Yeah.

2833
02:56:58.190 --> 02:57:02.200
And so that's why it's that way.
Yeah,
it's cool.

2834
02:57:02.201 --> 02:57:04.850
If you ever get a chance to go to the factory up there,

2835
02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:08.240
it's worth checking out because it isn't just like,
oh,
a factor.

2836
02:57:08.241 --> 02:57:11.050
It's like a factory.
You can kind of hang out there.
It's kind of,
there's like a,

2837
02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:13.580
would you like a pro shop?
Yeah,

2838
02:57:13.581 --> 02:57:16.760
you can come and go in there and then like kind of open.

2839
02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:20.780
You can talk to the people.
It's good man.
That's good.
So yeah.
Oh yeah,

2840
02:57:20.781 --> 02:57:24.290
I would recommend that too.
In Farmington,
Maine by the way,

2841
02:57:26.450 --> 02:57:27.320
that's where it is anyway.

2842
02:57:27.530 --> 02:57:32.530
Also on there is joggers and rash guards and close.

2843
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:38.420
Yup,
for sure.
For sure.
The rash guards,
compression,

2844
02:57:38.421 --> 02:57:42.800
compression gear was for gen supplements as well,
so we got for supplements,

2845
02:57:42.830 --> 02:57:43.663
joint warfare,

2846
02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:48.410
which is going to help your joints for a bunch of different reasons.

2847
02:57:48.650 --> 02:57:52.160
I get awesome compliments about that,

2848
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:54.440
that I'm stoked on that.

2849
02:57:54.470 --> 02:57:58.010
Krill oil also going to help your joints and it's going to help your a whole

2850
02:57:58.011 --> 02:58:01.040
life and then you've got the discipline,

2851
02:58:01.230 --> 02:58:03.960
which I'm on a lot of discipline right now and I didn't even realize that we

2852
02:58:03.961 --> 02:58:08.070
were at a three hour podcast at this moment in time through and we recorded a

2853
02:58:08.071 --> 02:58:12.270
couple other podcasts today.
It's shorter podcast,
but podcasts nonetheless,

2854
02:58:12.300 --> 02:58:14.190
you over here getting the upper hand on in life.

2855
02:58:16.230 --> 02:58:20.040
He scoops of disciplines I'm doing,
I have to feel like I understand it.

2856
02:58:20.130 --> 02:58:23.640
So discipline,
pre life,
pre mission,

2857
02:58:23.850 --> 02:58:26.100
pre function.

2858
02:58:30.860 --> 02:58:34.800
Then you're going to get some into any format,
mental format,

2859
02:58:34.830 --> 02:58:37.490
physical format.
Uh,

2860
02:58:37.890 --> 02:58:42.890
my middle daughter took the actsh on Saturday and she came home.

2861
02:58:45.721 --> 02:58:46.100
She,
I,

2862
02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:50.520
I kind of fueled her up on some desert when before rolling in and she came back

2863
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:55.320
fired up.
She was like,
yeah,
no,
I felt so bad.

2864
02:58:55.690 --> 02:58:57.830
And I was like,
yeah,
you're just,
you're discipline.

2865
02:58:58.280 --> 02:59:02.280
How scoops I gave her and you know,
she's not as big as me,

2866
02:59:02.540 --> 02:59:07.540
but I still gave it to show up for these guys.
I'm done for the three scoops.

2867
02:59:07.541 --> 02:59:09.730
That discipline by the way.
Yeah.

2868
02:59:10.130 --> 02:59:12.090
It's kind of a double effect that I could see how that can be,

2869
02:59:12.091 --> 02:59:14.370
especially if you're going into some situation,

2870
02:59:14.371 --> 02:59:18.630
like a test or even like a Jujitsu situation whenever you just Georgia for sure.

2871
02:59:18.690 --> 02:59:22.110
Yeah.
And then even afterwards,
when you remember how like solid you,

2872
02:59:22.111 --> 02:59:24.630
where you're like,
you kind of gets you fired up.
Yeah.
It's true.

2873
02:59:24.750 --> 02:59:29.290
It's like a double layered.
You got fired up because you got fired up.

2874
02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:32.580
You're like that though too.
Yes,
I do very much.
And uh oh yeah.

2875
02:59:32.581 --> 02:59:34.650
And the last thing is,
and it's not the lights,
the last,

2876
02:59:34.651 --> 02:59:37.240
but certainly not the least,
is is something called milk.

2877
02:59:38.070 --> 02:59:40.110
If you want to know what milk is,
it's real simple.

2878
02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:44.340
Milk is molten smoke straight on some additional protein.

2879
02:59:45.870 --> 02:59:48.900
I mean Molt pancakes straight out.
How did you do?
Okay,

2880
02:59:48.901 --> 02:59:52.740
so now you're going down this rabbit hole of just making milk.
Everything.
Okay,

2881
02:59:52.741 --> 02:59:55.980
here's the thing,
I'm sketch about the pancakes,
right?
So first of all,

2882
02:59:55.981 --> 02:59:59.970
I don't even like,
I straight up don't even like pancakes at all.

2883
03:00:00.590 --> 03:00:03.870
It's interesting for me to even think about making Moke pancakes.

2884
03:00:03.871 --> 03:00:06.510
Maybe it's something I could try because maybe I would like it.
Well,

2885
03:00:06.511 --> 03:00:10.860
if you don't like it,
here's the thing,
I'm not a monk pancake like expert at all.

2886
03:00:10.890 --> 03:00:13.680
Okay?
So I need to tell people how to make it.
Well,
here's the thing.

2887
03:00:13.681 --> 03:00:16.710
This is how I made them.
So I get tasked with wait,

2888
03:00:16.711 --> 03:00:19.440
were they good because they weren't good and let's not talk about it.
Oh,

2889
03:00:19.441 --> 03:00:23.100
they're real good.
So did you put Maple Syrup on them?
I did

2890
03:00:24.770 --> 03:00:28.840
read labels.
Sort of come from origin,
main negative.

2891
03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:32.420
Then again?
No,
I can't say that.
I don't think so.
Not that I know of,

2892
03:00:32.490 --> 03:00:36.810
but I didn't read the bottle or nothing good though.
Oh well,
okay.

2893
03:00:36.811 --> 03:00:39.330
On Saturdays or Sundays depending.
I get,

2894
03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:43.110
I make pancakes so there's only one day and it's for the kids and all this
stuff.

2895
03:00:43.111 --> 03:00:44.730
So she a thing.
Oh that's cool.
Hey,

2896
03:00:44.731 --> 03:00:46.110
you know what I'm gonna do for your kids this weekend.

2897
03:00:46.111 --> 03:00:48.510
I'm going to give you a bunch of carbohydrates and poison you.
Yeah,

2898
03:00:48.570 --> 03:00:51.420
well Dan and my defense,
Maple Syrup,

2899
03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:55.440
I got these or my wife got these Paleo,
it's Paleo pancake mix.

2900
03:00:57.410 --> 03:00:59.980
Was that Allman powder or something?
I don't

2901
03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:04.840
<v 2>know.
Okay.
Paleo pancake mix check.
So boom,
I go in and you know,
pancake mix.</v>

2902
03:01:04.841 --> 03:01:07.960
It's like a certain kind of mix to create like a pink,
the banking,

2903
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:14.220
I don't know.
Anyway,
but then I'm like wait,
mold mixed dentition makes,

2904
03:01:14.350 --> 03:01:15.183
I could,

2905
03:01:15.910 --> 03:01:19.510
I could easily gem this whole thing up easily and I'm not making it just for me

2906
03:01:19.511 --> 03:01:24.511
as an experiment and my kids are to wake up but I give them more pancakes.

2907
03:01:24.900 --> 03:01:29.030
They are not correct.
I will hear about it or the whole thing is a flop.
Yeah,

2908
03:01:29.860 --> 03:01:33.070
I guess technically I just make regular pancakes later but it wasn't about that

2909
03:01:33.071 --> 03:01:35.680
right then and there I was trying to deliver big time so I can just start

2910
03:01:35.681 --> 03:01:39.790
throwing random ingredients in a recipe in the back of it.
So this is what I did.

2911
03:01:40.390 --> 03:01:44.860
He called for a cup and a third of pancake mix.

2912
03:01:44.890 --> 03:01:48.220
I just put like a little less than a cup and then you know a third little bit

2913
03:01:48.221 --> 03:01:52.600
over a third cup milk milk in there,

2914
03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:56.480
a little bit of water.
Some MCT oil I put in,

2915
03:01:56.481 --> 03:01:58.720
he calls for like you can put butter and I did boot butter,

2916
03:01:59.050 --> 03:02:04.000
grass fed butter by the way.
And there was an eggs.
Yeah.

2917
03:02:04.060 --> 03:02:06.550
So you put an egg boom,
mixed it all up.

2918
03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:11.470
Pancakes.
Oh,
I put chocolate chips in the form of a happy face.

2919
03:02:11.471 --> 03:02:16.420
Two weeks from there.
From time to time and yeah,
so did that.
Yeah.

2920
03:02:16.421 --> 03:02:20.620
More like a sad face at your house.
But boom.

2921
03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:24.420
I make them a little bit darker obviously because of the chocolate.

2922
03:02:24.421 --> 03:02:27.470
It was the chocolate peanut butter,
by the way.
It wasn't the minute.
Yeah.

2923
03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:32.320
Well yeah,
there was darker Brown.
Yeah.
Not the mint too,

2924
03:02:32.321 --> 03:02:35.680
by the way.
I think that you're risking jamming up pancakes.
Where the mint,

2925
03:02:35.710 --> 03:02:39.850
I think,
I don't know.
I didn't do it anyway.
Yeah.
Chemo good boom.
Maple Syrup,

2926
03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:43.750
boom.
Big Hit kids like the kids didn't know,
but they,

2927
03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:46.940
it had the peanut butter kind of flavor in there.
It's good.
Yeah.

2928
03:02:47.310 --> 03:02:47.581
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2929
03:02:47.581 --> 03:02:51.240
So that's the mall could normally goes with milk or you can put it in water,

2930
03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:54.390
but that's like a ham sandwich.
Whereas if you put milk in there,

2931
03:02:54.391 --> 03:02:56.150
it's like a dental issue.
She know what it did too.

2932
03:02:56.160 --> 03:02:59.370
I put a two drops of vanilla in there.
Oh,
Andy.

2933
03:03:00.180 --> 03:03:04.570
Andy Burke came home from camp and we were just talking about camp and oh this

2934
03:03:04.580 --> 03:03:05.101
is cool.
You know,

2935
03:03:05.101 --> 03:03:08.100
he's like alcoholism and hospital meeting everyone and training and blah blah

2936
03:03:08.101 --> 03:03:11.070
blah.
And he's like,
you know what?
I really liked him and I was like,

2937
03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:15.610
oh this is my first time having more.
He's all handled.

2938
03:03:16.050 --> 03:03:20.640
This is surprisingly good bro.
We already knew that and I was like ah you,

2939
03:03:20.641 --> 03:03:24.870
you do you think people don't believe it is your instinct to think,

2940
03:03:24.930 --> 03:03:26.880
oh this is some kind of a supplement.

2941
03:03:26.881 --> 03:03:29.220
It's going to taste bad and I just have to deal with it but this won't make

2942
03:03:29.250 --> 03:03:33.660
maybe tastes okay and therefore you know these guys are talking up.

2943
03:03:34.050 --> 03:03:39.030
But the reality is the reality is it's good.
It's like a dessert.

2944
03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:44.520
Like a milkshake.
Yup.
That's the milk and has as good for you.

2945
03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:45.990
That's the crazy thing.
All right,

2946
03:03:45.991 --> 03:03:49.500
so cool then can get all that stuff@originmain.com.

2947
03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:51.920
<v 2>Yes.
And also Jack was store,</v>

2948
03:03:51.921 --> 03:03:56.810
it's called Jocko store and this is where you can get shirts,
hoodies,

2949
03:03:57.260 --> 03:04:01.790
rash,
other rash guards,
more,
more skewed towards the path,

2950
03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:04.610
the message,
the message.
Anyway,

2951
03:04:04.611 --> 03:04:08.000
there's some cool stuff on there if you want to represent discipline equals

2952
03:04:08.001 --> 03:04:10.460
freedom.
Cause discipline does equal freedom,
by the way.

2953
03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:15.440
That's one of those things like you can think about that for like 20 days and

2954
03:04:15.450 --> 03:04:15.800
it'll,

2955
03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:20.600
it'll make more and more sense over the three 20 days and then after two years,

2956
03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:24.500
and in my case,
three years makes even more sense.
You see it everywhere.

2957
03:04:24.501 --> 03:04:27.440
It just lingers revisiting.
Yeah.
And so it does end.

2958
03:04:27.441 --> 03:04:30.050
If you want to represent Jocko,

2959
03:04:30.051 --> 03:04:32.240
store.com that's where you can get the stuff cool stuff on there.

2960
03:04:32.241 --> 03:04:35.760
Some new stuff on there too,
by the way.
Really?
Yes.
Oh,

2961
03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:37.430
because you're always making stuff.

2962
03:04:37.431 --> 03:04:39.920
I don't even know about decentralized command style.
Well,

2963
03:04:39.921 --> 03:04:43.250
we've got a few novelty items you,
you know,

2964
03:04:44.050 --> 03:04:47.840
I'm assuming if I have it correctly,
it's just something that's pretty cool.

2965
03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:52.340
You know,
you gotta go in there and find out any off all the items.
Sure.

2966
03:04:52.700 --> 03:04:54.980
You think people are going to read you think people on the path without spending

2967
03:04:54.981 --> 03:04:59.060
their hard earned money on novelty items?
Is that what's going on?
Well,

2968
03:04:59.090 --> 03:05:02.510
there's always layers,
so it's not just novelty,
it's still,

2969
03:05:02.511 --> 03:05:03.980
you're still representing big time.

2970
03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:09.500
100% but one of the layers is just quite novel in my opinion.

2971
03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:13.550
Anyway.
Go there.
[inaudible] dot com 20 and stuff.
Yeah,
we'll do it.

2972
03:05:13.551 --> 03:05:17.810
That's why you gotta know Tacos,
check,
check,
check Jocko.
store.com anyway,

2973
03:05:17.811 --> 03:05:20.510
hats on there as well.
A lot of cool stuff.
Anyway.

2974
03:05:20.660 --> 03:05:24.200
Chocolate store.com good way to support.
Good way to stay on the path.

2975
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:29.340
It's just good all around.
Good.
Did you see,
uh,

2976
03:05:30.200 --> 03:05:33.890
what was it?
What's his name?
I'm not,
what's the name but the,
the,

2977
03:05:33.891 --> 03:05:36.290
you know the Nike Commercial,
right.

2978
03:05:36.740 --> 03:05:38.810
You know the Nike commercials been in the News,
right?

2979
03:05:38.811 --> 03:05:43.100
The controller and Theo Vaughn was like,
hey,

2980
03:05:43.760 --> 03:05:47.860
Nike borrower
deal.
Put that out.

2981
03:05:48.800 --> 03:05:51.650
You know what that is?
Maybe.
Maybe,
maybe not.
Obviously,
you know,

2982
03:05:51.651 --> 03:05:54.440
when you look at it,
it's like,
hey,
yeah,
he,
they did the same thing.

2983
03:05:54.470 --> 03:05:57.830
Put it that way out of where they got it from.
You're not okay.
Whatever.
Um,

2984
03:05:57.860 --> 03:06:00.910
but they did do the same thing,
but here's the,

2985
03:06:00.980 --> 03:06:04.370
here's what I really got from that whole thing,
especially his video,

2986
03:06:04.371 --> 03:06:06.920
how he did it.
He's like,
watch it.
Do what it did.

2987
03:06:07.010 --> 03:06:09.050
It really illustrated that that concept,

2988
03:06:09.051 --> 03:06:12.340
like how we stuck about all the time where when you,

2989
03:06:12.380 --> 03:06:16.040
when someone says good like that,
it really stands out.

2990
03:06:16.041 --> 03:06:17.480
Now you see that everywhere.

2991
03:06:17.481 --> 03:06:21.020
Even if you see the word good written on them on a sign or something,

2992
03:06:21.021 --> 03:06:23.330
you're like [inaudible] he didn't see what I'm saying.

2993
03:06:23.331 --> 03:06:26.360
So it sticks out in your mind just way more and it again,

2994
03:06:26.361 --> 03:06:30.770
whether that happened or not,
it's a weird thing to pick.
Yeah,

2995
03:06:31.030 --> 03:06:34.890
that's not,
that's a weird word to pick for the ad for the Nike Ad.

2996
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:42.170
It's a little bit,
it's not a normal word to pick in my opinion.

2997
03:06:42.650 --> 03:06:44.810
It's a,
it's a good word to pick.

2998
03:06:48.110 --> 03:06:52.400
But anyways,
nonetheless good.
It's all good man.
You're the man.

2999
03:06:53.090 --> 03:06:56.010
I'm also a good way to support.
Did

3000
03:06:56.010 --> 03:07:00.420
<v 3>you sell it to,
you kind of had my back though.
Didn't hear Yo Yo,
what's up?
Yeah.</v>

3001
03:07:00.430 --> 03:07:05.040
And it,
and it makes sense too.
Yeah.
Just the whole deal.
I mean,
you know,

3002
03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:09.390
but yeah,
I think that when you hear that you,
I always hear,
oh John,

3003
03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:11.010
I just hear you saying it.
You know,

3004
03:07:11.400 --> 03:07:15.210
even if I see the word good in all caps in a regular sentence,

3005
03:07:15.760 --> 03:07:18.990
like in a different context,
I'll be low.
It'll remind me of it.

3006
03:07:18.991 --> 03:07:23.710
You see what I'm saying?
It just sticks out like that.
Anyway,
good way.

3007
03:07:23.730 --> 03:07:27.540
Support also is to subscribe on iTunes and stitcher.

3008
03:07:27.990 --> 03:07:30.510
If you're android,
Google play and you know,
wherever we,

3009
03:07:30.540 --> 03:07:32.340
where we listened to your pod,
your podcast,

3010
03:07:32.341 --> 03:07:37.341
just subscribe and don't forget that there is the warrior kid podcasts of which

3011
03:07:38.461 --> 03:07:41.070
we recorded a couple of more today.
So we've got some fresh ones out there.

3012
03:07:41.070 --> 03:07:45.400
I apologize to everyone for taking so long to get those out.
Uh,

3013
03:07:45.540 --> 03:07:48.120
life got the upper hand a little bit we back,

3014
03:07:48.270 --> 03:07:52.960
but that's why we had to get default aggressive this weekend and just crushing

3015
03:07:52.970 --> 03:07:54.960
or some of those.
Uh,
yeah,

3016
03:07:54.961 --> 03:07:59.130
so warrior could podcasts for your kids and for well really uncle Jake has

3017
03:07:59.131 --> 03:08:01.620
lessons for everybody also wore or your kid.

3018
03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:06.420
There's a warrior kid@irishoaksranch.com.
Aiden Aiden.

3019
03:08:06.510 --> 03:08:11.430
He's up there working hard and he's making,
he's got a business,
he's making soap,

3020
03:08:11.550 --> 03:08:15.930
Jocko soap,
good soap.
And you can get that there.

3021
03:08:16.020 --> 03:08:21.020
Help help yourself and you help yourself by stay staying clean.

3022
03:08:22.200 --> 03:08:23.940
That's the idea.
Stay clean.

3023
03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:29.760
The Youtube Channel,
if you want to see echoes,
legit video.

3024
03:08:29.761 --> 03:08:34.410
Did you post the,
um,
the uh,
the video that you just made for the revenge,

3025
03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:38.850
revenge,
revenge video,
you call it the frigging that's interesting.
Yeah,

3026
03:08:38.851 --> 03:08:42.720
that is there something strange there.
I have not posted that yet,
but yes.
Yes.

3027
03:08:42.900 --> 03:08:47.760
That's the youtube video youtube channel,
which is called Jocko podcast.

3028
03:08:47.880 --> 03:08:48.930
It's a youtube channel.

3029
03:08:48.990 --> 03:08:53.190
You can watch all the youtube videos on there and then you can leave crazy

3030
03:08:53.191 --> 03:08:57.450
comments from some anonymous thing about all kinds of crazy stuff,
which is fun.

3031
03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:02.040
Whatever you like.
Also,
Becky,
back to working out.

3032
03:09:02.100 --> 03:09:06.030
I got really okay on it.com on it.
The company on it.

3033
03:09:06.090 --> 03:09:10.410
Don't I got rings until you recently.
Here's the thing about rings again.

3034
03:09:10.411 --> 03:09:13.710
I said before where you know,
you're always preaching about the rings,

3035
03:09:14.490 --> 03:09:16.470
one of the two,
the,
what do you call it,
the staples.

3036
03:09:16.620 --> 03:09:21.620
It's actually in many ways considered to me to be the first thing you could get

3037
03:09:21.661 --> 03:09:24.240
if you,
if you had one thing you could get,

3038
03:09:24.270 --> 03:09:27.330
you could get rings and you could do really well with them.
Yeah.
And I'm,

3039
03:09:27.331 --> 03:09:31.170
I'm now reaping the benefits of the rings.
I've got them,
brings on,

3040
03:09:31.171 --> 03:09:33.900
it rings through like their backs repeat don't,
they're like what?
Yeah,

3041
03:09:33.930 --> 03:09:36.300
we got to get word rings.
I always tell everyone get wood rings.

3042
03:09:36.301 --> 03:09:39.570
Not Plastic rings.
Not Metal Rings.
Get Wood rings because they absorb the sweat.

3043
03:09:40.520 --> 03:09:45.030
Yeah.
Anything else is slippery.
That's horrible.
Yeah.
So and my kids are,
you know,

3044
03:09:45.031 --> 03:09:48.020
and they're adjustable.
You know what I mean?
I've only had on it rings.

3045
03:09:48.021 --> 03:09:51.060
So if they're cool to have adjustable by number and it's all this stuff.

3046
03:09:51.061 --> 03:09:54.040
So my kids two years old and five years old,

3047
03:09:54.250 --> 03:09:58.570
<v 2>like they'll swing on them.
Like they get real creative with them anyway.
No,</v>

3048
03:09:59.010 --> 03:10:01.330
not yet.
But I'll do the,

3049
03:10:02.020 --> 03:10:04.180
it's all these little functional things anyway.

3050
03:10:04.240 --> 03:10:06.470
There's a lot to be gained with the rings.
I'm a,

3051
03:10:06.510 --> 03:10:09.130
I'm a believer of the rings now and now.

3052
03:10:09.430 --> 03:10:13.920
I would agree with you 100% that that should be kind of the,
the first thing

3053
03:10:14.220 --> 03:10:15.053
<v 0>I used to say,</v>

3054
03:10:15.680 --> 03:10:19.770
you might as well get rings and you can do depths and you can do pushups and you

3055
03:10:19.771 --> 03:10:24.420
can do muscle ups and you can do like weird kind of squatting planking,

3056
03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:28.320
all kinds of stuff.
Iron Cross,
which I can't do by the way,

3057
03:10:28.530 --> 03:10:30.630
just in case anyone gets the idea that I can do and I across,

3058
03:10:30.631 --> 03:10:32.400
I'm here to tell you we cannot even come close.

3059
03:10:32.530 --> 03:10:35.960
<v 2>Yeah,
that'd be pretty impressive.
It's impressive even if a little gang and do,</v>

3060
03:10:36.310 --> 03:10:39.700
um,
yeah,
but here's the thing about rings and pullups specifically,

3061
03:10:39.820 --> 03:10:43.480
and this is why it's better than a pull up bar because pullups pull up bars,

3062
03:10:43.481 --> 03:10:47.480
koans.
Good.
Really good.
I've had a pull up bar for a long time.
Um,

3063
03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:48.610
but the rings is like,
yeah,

3064
03:10:48.611 --> 03:10:51.990
you can adjust for pull ups and then you can adjust them down so you can do kind

3065
03:10:51.991 --> 03:10:54.550
of like a rose situate,
you get there,
call adjustable.

3066
03:10:54.670 --> 03:10:58.600
You can do a stuff if you're Barista rings all day.
That's the overall,

3067
03:10:59.920 --> 03:11:04.710
it extended my workout literally by like 30% Dang.
30 yellow.
Yeah.

3068
03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:07.300
Cause there's other like I use them every single time.

3069
03:11:07.570 --> 03:11:10.510
Did different exercises majorly.
Anyway.
Anyway,

3070
03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:15.460
those are rings is and a lot of other cool stuff on [inaudible] dot com so yeah

3071
03:11:15.461 --> 03:11:17.230
man,
browse around,
see what up.

3072
03:11:17.840 --> 03:11:21.440
<v 0>Get some psychological warfare album.
We're working on the next one.</v>

3073
03:11:21.470 --> 03:11:23.720
I'm thinking that the next one is not going to come out.

3074
03:11:23.930 --> 03:11:26.750
It's going to come out right around Christmas is my guess.

3075
03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:30.980
So if you have anything somebody wants one about shopping compulsive,

3076
03:11:30.981 --> 03:11:34.880
how do I shop?
Stop Compulsive shopping.
I don't know if I can tackle that one.

3077
03:11:34.881 --> 03:11:37.820
You know why I have no compulsion to shop.
I don't really even like shopping.

3078
03:11:37.821 --> 03:11:38.780
Only like going to the store.

3079
03:11:39.530 --> 03:11:43.910
You don't know I'm gonna buy anything with the demons of shopping look like
I've,

3080
03:11:44.480 --> 03:11:47.900
I will say I've seen it because you see people that buy things that they can't

3081
03:11:47.901 --> 03:11:52.040
really afford.
So I guess maybe we could talk about it cause yeah,
no,

3082
03:11:52.041 --> 03:11:55.160
actually now that I think about it,
I can talk about that.
Yeah,
we can,
we can,

3083
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:57.620
we can put together or something.
So psychological warfare,

3084
03:11:57.621 --> 03:12:00.620
if you've got a little moments of weakness you want to overcome,

3085
03:12:01.070 --> 03:12:05.930
I can talk to you personally about that through your iPhone.
Google play,

3086
03:12:05.931 --> 03:12:08.690
iTunes,
MP three for through your,
through your android.

3087
03:12:08.691 --> 03:12:11.840
I don't want to leave y'all out through your Samsung,
right?
Sure.

3088
03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:14.420
We're equal opportunity platform.

3089
03:12:14.830 --> 03:12:18.310
<v 2>Device devices in every scenario I'd say.</v>

3090
03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:23.880
And also you can get that Jocko white tea.
I'm on that train too far.

3091
03:12:23.930 --> 03:12:27.040
There's a lot of trains and the jungle situation.

3092
03:12:27.690 --> 03:12:31.780
It's supplementation situation.
It's been hot.
Yeah.

3093
03:12:32.770 --> 03:12:36.250
<v 0>Well when it was hot up in Maine at the camp,
how good did that tea taste?</v>

3094
03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:39.220
Legit cause they had it

3095
03:12:42.330 --> 03:12:45.910
crazy.
So yeah,
you can get that though.
The dry tea as well.

3096
03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.580
If you want to brew your own team now that winter is coming,

3097
03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:52.130
you need to get the hot tea so you can have a little little warmth

3098
03:12:52.730 --> 03:12:55.250
<v 3>on your throat.
But that was never really your thing,
right?</v>

3099
03:12:55.630 --> 03:12:59.150
No it wasn't.
But

3100
03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:02.620
it is now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You make the adjustment.

3101
03:13:02.621 --> 03:13:04.340
You're like oh I've been missing out on.
Yeah.

3102
03:13:04.370 --> 03:13:07.780
Cause sometimes sometimes you just like,

3103
03:13:07.781 --> 03:13:10.060
it's a little chilly out Neil.
Comfort,

3104
03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:16.090
comfort and that's what you need all the time.
Jocko.
Comfort Charlotte.
Uh Okay.

3105
03:13:16.091 --> 03:13:17.350
So then I also got some books.

3106
03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:20.830
We've got the way of the warrior kid and Mark's mission.

3107
03:13:20.890 --> 03:13:25.890
This is for kids between the ages of four and 84 because everybody can get

3108
03:13:27.761 --> 03:13:28.594
something.
Yeah.

3109
03:13:28.900 --> 03:13:33.900
You got my five year old fired up about getting the job.

3110
03:13:36.500 --> 03:13:36.970
Yeah.

3111
03:13:36.970 --> 03:13:41.260
In the second book mark who's a young character in the book wants to get once

3112
03:13:41.261 --> 03:13:45.010
you get a new bike,
but he needs money in order to get money.
Guess what you need?

3113
03:13:45.011 --> 03:13:50.000
You need a job son.
You need a job or sell some stuff or sell some stuff.

3114
03:13:51.020 --> 03:13:52.930
That's what he has to do.
So yeah,

3115
03:13:52.931 --> 03:13:57.070
if you want to give your kids a good book that will teach them about discipline,

3116
03:13:57.071 --> 03:13:58.000
hard work,

3117
03:13:59.540 --> 03:13:59.980
<v 5>okay.</v>

3118
03:13:59.980 --> 03:14:04.840
<v 3>Being kind.
Yeah.
But the dichotomy of being strong,</v>

3119
03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:08.650
it's all in their cat,
man is so it's all in there.

3120
03:14:09.430 --> 03:14:13.780
You explain it while you uncle Jake,
whoever,
one of you guys.

3121
03:14:14.530 --> 03:14:17.590
It's good how you explain it in real simple terms.

3122
03:14:17.591 --> 03:14:19.390
And then you get this kid mark,

3123
03:14:19.570 --> 03:14:21.760
especially on the song I'm talking about the second corner right now where he's

3124
03:14:21.761 --> 03:14:26.050
like,
he kind of,
he overcame some stuff.
He's super strong right now,

3125
03:14:26.400 --> 03:14:28.420
but still a lot to learn.
So he understands it.

3126
03:14:28.450 --> 03:14:30.430
And then at first he's like questioning it.

3127
03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:33.730
Then he starts to understand any questions at Denny understands,

3128
03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:35.910
then he's fired up about doing it.
You know what I mean?
Cause he gets,

3129
03:14:36.230 --> 03:14:38.650
but it's really good.
And that's literally how like the kid,

3130
03:14:38.651 --> 03:14:41.530
whoever you're reading,
in my case,
I'm only reading to my daughter by the way,

3131
03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:45.340
she's fine.
And I watch her getting just as fired up is mark,

3132
03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:50.470
I'm a business owner.
She's like,
oh my God,
no,
she gets fired up.
Freeze.
Good man.

3133
03:14:50.740 --> 03:14:53.200
Really good.
It's interesting to see the little transition.

3134
03:14:53.770 --> 03:14:55.390
I've got so much good feedback.
Anyway,

3135
03:14:55.391 --> 03:14:58.420
so that's that a way of the warrior kid and Mark's mission.

3136
03:14:58.690 --> 03:15:03.100
Also the discipline equals freedom field manual,
which is solid,

3137
03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:08.410
which is solid.
It's a good daily reminder.
It's not,
uh,

3138
03:15:08.530 --> 03:15:11.170
you don't need to read that whole book everyday.
You can read one,

3139
03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:14.320
you can read three pages and you can get yourself,
you know,

3140
03:15:14.321 --> 03:15:15.760
you might've been veering off the path a little bit.

3141
03:15:15.761 --> 03:15:19.030
Get yourself right back on the path.
Yeah,
it's a good thing to read.

3142
03:15:19.210 --> 03:15:24.190
You could like read that it a page,
two pages,
three pages every day.
It will.

3143
03:15:24.700 --> 03:15:25.870
Would you,
I would say this,

3144
03:15:26.050 --> 03:15:29.360
it will absolutely help you if you read three pages a day.
Yeah.

3145
03:15:29.590 --> 03:15:33.780
That's a bold statement to,
I'm saying this book a book,
this isn't a,

3146
03:15:33.820 --> 03:15:36.670
this isn't the,
this isn't an exercise program.

3147
03:15:36.671 --> 03:15:38.770
This isn't a supplement that you take.
This isn't a,

3148
03:15:38.980 --> 03:15:42.190
this isn't a treatment that you get.
This is a book pages in a book.

3149
03:15:42.191 --> 03:15:44.310
If you read them,
it's going to help you.
That's,

3150
03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:47.230
that's what my statement is and I believe to be true.
Why?

3151
03:15:47.231 --> 03:15:50.010
Because I read it I the damn thing and

3152
03:15:50.010 --> 03:15:53.610
<v 0>I still read.
I didn't tell.
And then we've got extreme ownership,</v>

3153
03:15:53.970 --> 03:15:58.970
which is combat leadership wrote with my brother Leif Babin and how to take the

3154
03:16:00.151 --> 03:16:03.240
principles that we learned in combat and use them and in your business and life.

3155
03:16:03.241 --> 03:16:07.710
And the follow on book to that,
the dichotomy of leadership,

3156
03:16:07.770 --> 03:16:09.660
which I'd mentioned the word dichotomy quite a bit.

3157
03:16:09.661 --> 03:16:11.670
Dean lister says it's my favorite word.

3158
03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:16.890
I'm not so sure it's my favorite word.
I think my favorite word is discipline,

3159
03:16:17.070 --> 03:16:21.420
but um,
I don't know if I have a favorite word.
Anyways,

3160
03:16:22.260 --> 03:16:25.440
I do talk about the dichotomy a lot because the dichotomy is present in

3161
03:16:25.441 --> 03:16:30.120
everything that we do.
So if you want to get this book,

3162
03:16:30.121 --> 03:16:33.330
it comes out September 25th if you want to get the first dish,

3163
03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:36.720
you should order it bill yesterday or right now because,

3164
03:16:37.710 --> 03:16:39.660
well you don't want to miss out on the first edition.

3165
03:16:39.900 --> 03:16:44.090
I got my first copies on the old one right there.
There it is.
So dichotomy,

3166
03:16:44.100 --> 03:16:46.440
leadership,
order it now.

3167
03:16:47.430 --> 03:16:49.620
September 25th it will come to your door.

3168
03:16:51.420 --> 03:16:52.470
Speaking of leadership,

3169
03:16:52.471 --> 03:16:55.680
we've got a leadership consulting company called Echelon Front,

3170
03:16:55.730 --> 03:17:00.120
and we solve problems through leadership.
It's me,

3171
03:17:00.810 --> 03:17:04.350
it's life.
It's JP Denelle,
Dave Burke,
Flynn Cochran.

3172
03:17:04.530 --> 03:17:06.090
We also got Mike Cirelli on board.

3173
03:17:06.091 --> 03:17:09.060
We've got a couple new members joining the team right now.

3174
03:17:10.410 --> 03:17:14.640
If you want us to come to your company,
go to Echelon Front Dotcom.

3175
03:17:14.700 --> 03:17:18.960
That's what we do.
Also the muster in San Francisco,
California.

3176
03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:24.030
Getting close to sold out.
We probably have a little bit left right now.
Um,

3177
03:17:24.090 --> 03:17:26.520
maybe by the time this podcast comes out,
it might be sold out.

3178
03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:29.730
If you want to come to the foster leadership event,
San Francisco,
California,

3179
03:17:29.731 --> 03:17:32.610
October 17th and 18th,
all of the other ones have sold out.

3180
03:17:34.020 --> 03:17:37.230
This one is going to sell out too.
If you want to come.

3181
03:17:37.380 --> 03:17:38.790
Don't wait till the last minute.

3182
03:17:38.791 --> 03:17:42.930
Don't wait until I post on social media that the muster sold out and then call

3183
03:17:42.931 --> 03:17:45.990
up and say,
can we please get one more people?
Because we can't.
If we could,

3184
03:17:45.991 --> 03:17:47.160
we wouldn't say it was sold out.

3185
03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:52.880
So just just register now for the muster and for current uniform personnel,

3186
03:17:56.671 --> 03:17:59.590
military law enforcement,
border patrol,
firefighters,
paramedics,
first,

3187
03:17:59.730 --> 03:18:00.451
first responders.

3188
03:18:00.451 --> 03:18:04.590
We've got the roll call September 21st we just opened up a few more seats.

3189
03:18:04.830 --> 03:18:06.270
I think we opened up 50 more seats.

3190
03:18:06.450 --> 03:18:08.580
We've done that twice now but it's going to be,

3191
03:18:08.610 --> 03:18:10.890
I don't know if we'll be able to do it again cause registration is going to be

3192
03:18:10.891 --> 03:18:11.724
closing soon.

3193
03:18:12.300 --> 03:18:17.300
That is also registered@extremeownership.com and of course now we have f

3194
03:18:17.681 --> 03:18:22.110
Overwatch where we are connecting Spec ops,

3195
03:18:22.620 --> 03:18:24.510
veterans,
combat aviation,

3196
03:18:24.511 --> 03:18:29.511
veterans with companies that need solid proficient leaders that understand and

3197
03:18:36.150 --> 03:18:41.150
can bring the attitude of extreme ownership into your company.

3198
03:18:42.720 --> 03:18:46.710
If you want to on either side,
if your vet and you want to get in,

3199
03:18:47.470 --> 03:18:52.060
get a look for a job.
If you're someone that needs a leader in your company,

3200
03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:55.000
go to [inaudible] dot com to get in the game.

3201
03:18:55.001 --> 03:18:59.890
And if you want to keep cruising with Echo Charles and me

3202
03:19:02.210 --> 03:19:05.750

3203
03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:09.530
well then you can find us on the Inter webs on Twitter,

3204

Key Bull,
hy

3205
03:19:15.140 --> 03:19:19.610
echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

3206
03:19:19.611 --> 03:19:24.611
And lastly to everyone that is serving and that has served in the u s military

3207
03:19:24.741 --> 03:19:29.741
thanks to you and your families for shielding us from evil and keeping us free.

3208
03:19:30.711 --> 03:19:34.190
And two police law enforcement,
correctional officers,

3209
03:19:34.310 --> 03:19:38.990
border patrol firefighters,
paramedics are there.
First responders here at home.

3210
03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:44.800
Thanks for being vigilant and protecting us and our families and to everyone

3211
03:19:46.071 --> 03:19:50.030
else out there.
Keep learning,
keep striving,

3212
03:19:50.070 --> 03:19:53.120
keep trying to figure out where you can get better and be better.

3213
03:19:53.270 --> 03:19:54.530
And it isn't easy

3214
03:19:56.180 --> 03:20:01.180
and it takes courage and it takes strength and it takes discipline day after day

3215
03:20:02.331 --> 03:20:07.331
after day to get up and face the unforgiving world and get after it.

3216
03:20:11.270 --> 03:20:16.220
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko out.
