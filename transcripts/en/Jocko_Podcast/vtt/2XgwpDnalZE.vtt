This is Jocko podcast number 76 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.000
Jocko Willink.
Good evening.
Echo did evening.

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.553
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.053
<v 0>freedom.</v>

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.720
That's something that you hear me talk about

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.323
all the time.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.160
And I say little things like don't take it for granted.

8
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.020
And I say be thankful for your freedom.

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.210
And I even say things like,

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.330
you don't appreciate your freedom until it's gone.

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
Pretty common statements you hear from people.

12
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.020
But how many of us

13
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.970
have actually had our freedom taken away

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.470
and not metaphorically speaking and not some self imposed and thereby self

15
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:10.320
controlled way

16
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880
and not in some way trapped by a situation in our life that we don't have the

17
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:22.260
courage to get out of.
But I am talking about an actual

18
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.623
loss

19
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.430
<v 1>of freedom.
Caged,</v>

20
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.530
<v 0>controlled,
starved,
beaten,</v>

21
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.330
tortured.
How long can you take that form?

22
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.860
An hour.
A day.

23
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.700
What about a week or a month?

24
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.630
What about a year?

25
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.823
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.070
<v 0>for six years.</v>

27
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.670
<v 1>What do you do?</v>

28
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.500
<v 0>How do you survive?</v>

29
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.480
How do you get up every day and face the awful reality

30
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.853
<v 1>that you live in</v>

31
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.680
<v 0>darkness.
Fear,</v>

32
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.213
<v 1>oppression.</v>

33
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.330
<v 0>And how do you take that darkness and that fear?</v>

34
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.320
And that oppression and turn it into something good.

35
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.763
<v 1>Well,</v>

36
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.340
<v 0>it is my honor today</v>

37
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.900
to have with us a man that can answer those questions.

38
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.320
Retired Navy,

39
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:19.321
Captain Charles Charlie Plumb Naval Academy graduate F Four Phantom fighter

40
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.970
pilot
and prisoner of war.

41
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.213
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

42
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.100
<v 0>written north Vietnam</v>

43
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.910
for six years.

44
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.990
Six years.

45
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.483
Sir.

46
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.920
It is an absolute honor to have you on and thank you so much for being here.

47
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.980
Thank you jack.
Oh,
it's a pleasure to be with you.
And

48
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.630
let's just start from the beginning of Captain Charlie Plumb you were you,

49
00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:09.190
I know you were born where?

50
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.640
<v 2>I was actually born in Gary,
Indiana during World War II.</v>

51
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.950
My father was about to be inducted and so he moved us to a little tiny town in

52
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.360
Kansas where he thought,
um,

53
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.180
my mother and I and my big sister could live there while he went off to war.

54
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.330
Well,
as it turned out,
he couldn't pass the physical so he didn't go to war.

55
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.150
But that's where I grew up in a tiny town in the middle,

56
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.880
<v 0>Kansas.
And I know you,
uh,</v>

57
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.223
you did,

58
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.230
you went to work pretty at a pretty early age throwing papers that you referred

59
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:46.770
to that in the book.
And I just,
not just in the stylistic thing,
isn't it frozen,

60
00:04:46.771 --> 00:04:48.750
but no one throws papers anymore.
It doesn't happen.

61
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.680
<v 2>There's no kids with paper roads anymore.
I guess that's true.</v>

62
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.530
I read a statistic one time of all the,

63
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.990
of all the successful people in the world,

64
00:04:56.991 --> 00:05:00.890
most of them were paper boys when they were kids,
but not anymore.
You know,
the,

65
00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:05.810
you're right,
you don't see that now they're throwing up Twitter posts.
That's it.

66
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.300
No,

67
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
I flew I through the to peak a daily capital there and there's a little town of,

68
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:17.370
um,
300 people and I had about 55 customers.
The,

69
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.490
the route was five miles long.

70
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.300
And on a cold February morning in Kansas,

71
00:05:23.301 --> 00:05:27.860
that was off the long way.
I finally convinced my father that I could,

72
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.220
that I could buy a motor scooter with all of my earnings.

73
00:05:31.221 --> 00:05:35.170
And so we went across the river where there was no bank in town and went across

74
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.610
the river to Perry,
Kansas.
And,
uh,

75
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.640
borrowed enough money to buy a Cushman motor scooter and I was only 14 when that

76
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:47.630
happens.
Yeah.
So,
um,
I got arrested one night

77
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.500
driving my motor skirt up to no good.
You got arrested on a motor scooter?
Well,

78
00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:57.830
I was trying to go to the county fair cause can you even speed a motor scooter?

79
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:59.000
Is that possible?
No,
no,
no.

80
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.680
But I was small for my age,
so at 14,
I,

81
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.830
I know I wasn't five feet and had my buddy on the back and he was even smaller

82
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.620
than I.

83
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.620
And I think that the cops just as these do look kids on a motor scooter in the

84
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.190
middle of the night and we were arrested and uh,
at some point,

85
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.320
I think it was a,
you had a,
a basketball coach.

86
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:25.610
There were coaching your school that was a pilot in World War II.
Yeah,
he was,

87
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.300
he was actually,
uh,
he,
he was a vet if it not a pilot.

88
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.700
He was a doughboy and world war one.

89
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.790
And he had shrapnel in his leg from his warning.
He walked with a limp and,

90
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.450
but then he was quite a disciplinarian and he,

91
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.800
he tried to make that a little basketball team work,
but we were just really not,

92
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.340
not very talented.
What is it about,
I don't know.

93
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.940
When I was a kid and I would see,
you know,
a Vietnam vet for me,

94
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.750
that's primarily what I would see his old Vietnam vets.
And I'd say,
Hey,

95
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:00.740
that guy's got shrapnel in his leg and walks with a limp.
When I grow up,

96
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:04.340
I want shrapnel in my leg and I want to walk with a limp.
That's my goal.

97
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.740
Is that just,
is that just part of Male,
you know,

98
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:14.090
boy in nature it may very well be so.

99
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:16.970
So what did he tell you about,
about pilots?

100
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:19.850
Did he explain that to you or how did you get the idea from,
you know,

101
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.300
being a doughboy to be in a pilot?
Well,

102
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:25.160
a quite a long transition.
See,

103
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:29.630
this was early on in my career and I had a coach later in high school that had

104
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:31.250
been a pilot in World War II.
Okay.

105
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.840
So a Bill Johnson had been a pilot and in fact,
uh,

106
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:36.674
he flew a,

107
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.920
a fas and off aircraft carriers and I was fascinated by that whole idea.

108
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.160
But I will tell you that being a hayseed from Kansas,

109
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:50.440
I never even dreamed of flying an airplane.
I,
I,

110
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.800
I'd never been in one.
Uh,
I seen them fly over,

111
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.640
but the whole idea of ever even riding in an airplane,

112
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.810
let alone piloting one was,
was beyond my grasp.

113
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.420
It really was it.
So,

114
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.780
so how did you end up then transitioning from high school and you end up going

115
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:12.800
to the Naval Academy?
Well,
that was kind of by accident too.
Uh,

116
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:16.310
I needed an education.
My parents were too poor to send me to college.

117
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.370
I started looking for scholarships and um,
my,

118
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.400
my older sister was dating a guy who was an inner OTC,

119
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:30.350
a student at University of Kansas.
And he gave me a book that says,

120
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:33.980
Here's how you apply for the OTC and Kansas.
Well,

121
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:38.750
the back page of the book in fairly small letters said,
oh,
by the way,

122
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.200
it's the same qualifications to go to the Naval Academy.
Well,
what the heck?

123
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.540
Did you even know what the Naval Academy was or did you figure it out right

124
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.180
there?
I did not know.
I really had no idea.

125
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.160
I didn't know about the army navy game.
I didn't know anything.

126
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.420
Now my closest relative and the military was a cousin in the coast guard.

127
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.760
And so I was just,

128
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.920
I was just ignorant about the military a total.
So,

129
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.790
you know,
I like,

130
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.330
I like to see here Jocko and tell you that at all these great dreams,
you know,

131
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.340
and being a fighter pilot and the admiral and commanding ships and squadrons and

132
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:19.650
all.
But no,
it was all by accident.
In fact,
I,

133
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.490
when I applied,
well,
you know,
you get to appointments from Congressmen,

134
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.270
the Congressmen of my district in Kansas,

135
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.300
I did it by a competitive method and,
and everybody who was interested took,

136
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.990
uh,
a government test to,
for a g rating,

137
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.780
no government service rating the GS test.

138
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.990
And there were about 35 guys that took the test.

139
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.260
And so he nominated five of us who got better scores on the test and the rest.

140
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.730
And then he appointed one,
uh,

141
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.740
one guy to the naval academy and an alternate and I was the second alternate.

142
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.540
Okay.
Well the first guy also had an appointment to,
to,
uh,

143
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.560
the air force academy.
So he took that,
the second guy discovered girls.

144
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.380
<v 3>Oh yeah.</v>

145
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.170
<v 2>So I was actually the second alternate they go.</v>

146
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.090
And so I got on that Greyhound bus in Kansas City,
Kansas.
And the two days later,

147
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.910
it took me two days to get to,
uh,
to Washington DC.

148
00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:28.570
And of course I was seeing country I'd never seen before.
Um,

149
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.890
and that's when I raise my hand as you did and pledge to defend the constitution

150
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.660
of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic.

151
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.610
<v 3>And then at some point it at the Athenaeum.
Did you,</v>

152
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.740
did you know about naval aviation,
I guess you did,
from,
uh,
from Bob Johnson,

153
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.450
he told you about naval aviation.

154
00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:50.130
Did you have that thought in your mind of naval aviation at that point?

155
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.210
<v 2>Not really.
I still,
uh,</v>

156
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.910
I still kind of assumed that I could never qualify to do that,
you know,
and,
and,

157
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.690
and thinking back at it,
you know,
I think,
well,
where were my dreams?
But,
um,

158
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.800
kids that grow up in little towns don't usually have big dreams.

159
00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:09.680
We don't know how to do that.
And my parents,

160
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.990
my father had completed the eighth grade and that was his education.

161
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.630
My mother had in fact completed high school,

162
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.130
but I was one of the first and the family to ever go to college.

163
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.350
And so,
um,
you know,
it was,
I,
it wasn't even,

164
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.950
it wasn't even a thought part of the thought process.
So,
uh,

165
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:34.130
once I got to the Naval Academy and you know,

166
00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:36.460
thought back to Bob Johnson and,
uh,
and,

167
00:11:36.461 --> 00:11:40.940
and that kind of experience and saw that there was a possibility of doing this,

168
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.300
then my energies and efforts to turn that towards a naval aviation.

169
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.690
<v 3>And it must have been,</v>

170
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:52.690
I mean that's always been ultra competitive after you cademy and I know we had

171
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.310
another pilot on Dave Burke

172
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.160
<v 2>and he was talking about how each step of the way he kind of looked around and</v>

173
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.780
said,
I think I can actually do this.
You know,
it's kind of the same thing.

174
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.860
You look around and say,

175
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:05.560
I think I can get the best grades or I think I can get you this position.

176
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.480
At some point you must have said,
I think I can.
I think I can do this.
There was,

177
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:13.060
as a matter of fact and is a great revelation,
you know,
when you're convenient,

178
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:18.040
finally talk to yourself into accepting the fact that you do have the talent to

179
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:21.480
do this.
Um,
and until that point you,

180
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.650
you don't really try as hard I guess.

181
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.270
And while you're at the academy,
also you,

182
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.910
is this when you got involved with an for the first time,
is that at the,

183
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.930
at the Naval Academy and was my high school sweetheart.
Oh yeah.

184
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.340
We played the French horn in the band together.

185
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.200
Those girls with the French orange.
Yeah.

186
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.960
Yeah,
she was a,
she is a beauty in and a,

187
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:51.760
it was a beauty and she showed up at our school,
but was,
um,
she,

188
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.230
she,
she came,
she,

189
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.740
she came into our little town in Kansas from Indiana and she had a boyfriend and

190
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:03.960
Indiana.
She wasn't telling me about,
you know,
for the first several,

191
00:13:03.961 --> 00:13:07.630
we don't care about that boyfriend.
And His name is Bart.

192
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.640
And then they called them black bart.

193
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.830
So Bart was,
um,
and,
and she wouldn't kiss me,
you know,

194
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.750
I mean,
we dated for months and it's the girl wouldn't kiss me.
Yeah.
Dang.

195
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:24.860
You know what I mean?
It's tough.
I mean,

196
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.860
I mean it's the most reaction I've ever seen.

197
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:28.480
Got Acrobat or whatever the podcast.

198
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.810
I think he's been there a bad memories on that.

199
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.410
Tobacco flashback her heart.

200
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.910
Maybe we should talk about your stories,

201
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.700
all kinds of kissing denials.
So,
uh,

202
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.370
finally I think it was thanksgiving.
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah,

203
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.880
it was,
it was right at Thanksgiving.

204
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.480
And I intercepted up a letter that she had gotten from Bart.

205
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.550
And how do you intercept the letter?

206
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.050
No,
I it was all above board,
but

207
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.310
we'll leave it at that,
I guess.
I guess we're going to leave that one.
I gay.

208
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.190
I confronted her,
this Skype Bart.
Oh No,
it's,
no,

209
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.170
we're serious and we're going to get married someday.
In fact,

210
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:24.190
he's coming to Kansas for Christmas.
I said,
I'm making a deal with you.

211
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.370
I said,
I don't think he's coming for Christmas.
And so if he comes,

212
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.210
I'll back off and you don't have to worry about me trying to kiss you anymore.

213
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.020
But if he doesn't come,
then you and I go steady.

214
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.800
Well,
he didn't come.
And so I,
that,

215
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.750
that started at a wonderful relationship.
We,
uh,

216
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:52.340
then went steady in high school of course.

217
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:57.341
And then I go off to the Naval Academy for peace from Kansas and um,

218
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.870
and she went to University of Kansas for her first year there.
And,

219
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.770
but we continued to communicate and,
and I say,
well,

220
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.120
I saw her at Christmas time when I came home and then she decided to move to

221
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:14.120
Washington DC to work for a senator out there.

222
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.770
And so she spent the next three years,
the last three years naval academy,

223
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.840
they're close enough so that we continue to see each other.
So it was,
um,

224
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.090
and it was one of those,
uh,
you know,

225
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.750
one and only kind of a thing cause I didn't really date a whole lot in high

226
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:34.640
school and she was yet for sure.
So then you guys got married,
did you,

227
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:37.730
did you wait until you graduated from the Naval Academy?
You,
no,
you can't,

228
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.600
you can't get married while you were at the Naval Academy.

229
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.500
At least you're not supposed to.
A couple of guys did and I didn't.

230
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.310
And so the day after I graduated from the Naval Academy,
uh,
we were,

231
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.350
we were married and my six buddy is held up their swords while one was a marine.

232
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:59.351
And so he held up his saber as we came down from the chapel through the arch of

233
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:03.170
swords.
And it was a beautiful day and a beautiful wedding.

234
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.850
And from there we went immediately to flight training.
Did you,

235
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.630
when did you find out you were getting picked up?
The flight trainer.
Our senior?

236
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.550
Yeah.
The last,
uh,
last part of our senior year you could apply and uh,

237
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:18.710
and then you go through all of the hoops that a,

238
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:22.070
that you go through to try to qualify for naval aviation.

239
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:27.370
So I found out probably a month or six weeks before I graduated.

240
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.820
That was going to be my,
my,
my tour.
Do you graduate in [inaudible] 64?
Yes.

241
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.120
So when you graduated,
did you guys,

242
00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:37.220
were you guys thinking Vietnam already know?

243
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:41.150
Was it just too early and there was limited operation so it wasn't really

244
00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:43.790
something that you,
a graduate thinking about front of mind?

245
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.940
I don't remember ever hearing the word Vietnam while I was in the Naval Academy.

246
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.053
Wow.
Yeah.

247
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.500
So you rolled to flight school just thinking,
Hey,
we're going to fly around,

248
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.980
we're going to go do regular deployments.
Were you'd to heard about,

249
00:16:57.981 --> 00:16:59.520
but you weren't thinking about Vietnam?
Yup.

250
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.990
So at what point was that in flight school when you first started thinking of

251
00:17:01.991 --> 00:17:05.030
yourself?
Yes.
Here we got guys over here dropping bombs.
Yeah,

252
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:10.031
we'll have Averett ev Alvarez was shot down the first a pod to be shot down and

253
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:13.970
August,
1964.
Okay.

254
00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:18.920
So it became a reality that while I was in flight training and another naval

255
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:23.660
aviator was in prison in Vietnam.
Now I didn't,
you know,

256
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.840
I didn't understand the politics.
I didn't question the politics of it at all.

257
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:32.890
I just did the best I could and flight training and the and enjoyed it,

258
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:38.090
you know.
I mean it's,
it's,
it's a kick.
Did you guys,
did your,

259
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.750
did your attitudes shifted also for,
for my generation,

260
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.690
when all of a sudden September 11th happened,
it was like,

261
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.410
it was like a paradigm shift and everyone's mentality that that day it such a

262
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:50.244
clear,

263
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.850
<v 0>clear demonstration and we all knew that we are going to war.</v>

264
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.740
And that was an immediate attitude shift.

265
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:00.540
Did you guys start to have a shift in attitude or was it because the way Vietnam

266
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:05.160
escalated more slowly?
Was it more of a,
a slow escalation in your minds as well?

267
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.050
<v 2>No,
it was a very slow,
um,
you know,
the little story of,
uh,</v>

268
00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.540
of the,
of the frog in the pot of boiling water,
you know,
jumps out in a hurry.

269
00:18:14.541 --> 00:18:19.310
But,
but no,
it was a,
it just warmed up very slowly for us.
And,

270
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.820
uh,
I didn't even as I went through fight training,
you know,

271
00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:25.760
I mean I learned to drop bombs and shoot guns and all that stuff.
And it was,

272
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.560
it was a challenging and,
uh,
it was exciting,
but I,

273
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.390
I didn't see the reality of it.

274
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.380
I didn't really picture myself as being in combat.
Um,

275
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.770
and so of course when I got my wings and then was assigned the f four Phantom,

276
00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:44.430
which at the time was the hottest airplane in the world,

277
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.390
mean we had the time to climb and records and the speed records.
And it's a,

278
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.790
it's a twice the speed of sound airplane.
And it was,
felt very fortunate to,
uh,

279
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:58.280
to have been assigned that airplane.
And so I came out here to San Diego to a,

280
00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.840
<v 0>to fly.
And you were talking about in your book,</v>

281
00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:04.370
you'd done a mid shipment tour where,
uh,
a phantom went down,

282
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.200
both pilots killed and,
and then you got to sign the f the fandom.

283
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.810
I did that give you any reservations at all?

284
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.540
<v 2>Uh,
I don't remember being afraid of the airplane,
uh,</v>

285
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.650
but I certainly gave it a lot of respect and especially around the ship,
uh,

286
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.630
because it's,
um,
you know,

287
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:27.520
I saw this thing go down at the Naval Academy and the summertime you get exposed

288
00:19:27.521 --> 00:19:30.730
to the possible built you might have in the future.

289
00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:35.480
So we go play marine for a while and we'd go to submarines for a while and,

290
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:37.540
and we go aboard ships,
uh,
it to,

291
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:42.500
to be line officers for awhile and we go to,
uh,

292
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:43.540
to,
to Pensacola.

293
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.620
And so I got a little touch of it there of actually being in airplanes.

294
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.520
And then my senior,
my senior cruise,
between my junior and senior year,

295
00:19:51.521 --> 00:19:54.640
I'm going to board the,
the Constellation,
the aircraft carrier,

296
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:57.070
constellation and a,

297
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:02.080
and we were out of Sasebo Japan and I'm watching flight ops from the bridge.

298
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:09.370
And so,
you know,
I'm looking down at this,
uh,
the airplanes,

299
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.330
uh,

300
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.250
launching and recovering on this aircraft carrier and I've had him came in and

301
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.620
actually broke the wire.
The pilot did okay,
but he broke keep,

302
00:20:18.621 --> 00:20:23.621
he picked up the wire and the wire snapped this cable that traps and airplane is

303
00:20:24.341 --> 00:20:27.640
two and a half inches in diameter.

304
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.790
It's a very thick steel wire round cable.
I'm is a really,

305
00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:35.791
really strong because it has to stop this 35,000 pound airplane going down to

306
00:20:36.641 --> 00:20:41.440
shoot at 170 miles an hour.
So,
but uh,

307
00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:46.180
for whatever reason the cable broke.
Okay.
The cable snapped around in,

308
00:20:46.181 --> 00:20:50.140
it cut off the of three different guys who are on the deck.
Okay.

309
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.400
And it was so fast that I couldn't even,
I couldn't even see it.

310
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:58.030
My eyes couldn't even follow this cable because there was just,
I mean,

311
00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:02.530
there's so much pressure,
so much energy involved.

312
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.120
And then the airplane,

313
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:08.470
the f four was slowed down to the point where the guy couldn't get it back in

314
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:09.304
the air.

315
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.660
And so it just dribbled off the bow of the aircraft carrier in the end of the

316
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:14.860
water.
Well,

317
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.280
of course then I then I turned my view to the stern of the ship to see if I

318
00:21:21.401 --> 00:21:26.401
could see what had happened with the few seconds that it took from when it's

319
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:31.510
settled in the water until I could see out the back of the,
of the ship.

320
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.080
It was gone.
There was no debris,
there was no oil,

321
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.910
there was nothing in the water behind this shit at this airplane and gone down.

322
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.410
So it was a shock to me,
of course.
Um,
but,

323
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:46.181
you know,

324
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:49.540
I think I started out with this mentality that is always going to happen to

325
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:53.880
somebody else,
you know,
never me.
And,
um,
and that I'm,
you know,

326
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.450
whatever happened,
I'm going to do it better.
And,
um,

327
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.260
and I think that's,
well,
you know,
this better than I,

328
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.900
you have to kind of have that mentality in combat.

329
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.740
You can't go in thinking you're going to get killed.
And so,
um,

330
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:14.120
so I,
I wasn't reluctant to fly the f four,
but I gave it I,

331
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.630
I think,
uh,
respect.

332
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.420
So you get that and you come out,
you're stationed in San Diego or San Diego,

333
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:23.380
right,
for when you,

334
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:26.260
when you're deployed for the first time Miramar Naval air station.

335
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.960
And that's where I helped start top gun.

336
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.140
That was kind of an interesting experience as well.
There was a,

337
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.230
there was a,
a,
a pool of students to fly the f four Phantom.

338
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:43.150
And I showed up here when they had about a six month waiting list for me to find

339
00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:47.950
this airplane.
Well,
six months was a long time,
you know,
for a 23 year old kid.

340
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:52.390
And,
uh,
I wanted to get in the air.
So a buddy of mine,

341
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.080
Paul creaky and I had gotten our wings at the same time.

342
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.440
It had been assigned the f four Phantom and we came out here and so we were both

343
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:02.110
going to have to wait for six months to find this airplane.

344
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:08.010
So we wandered down the flight line at Miramar and found the instrument training

345
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:13.800
squadron was flying the same airplane that we had flown in in flight chain of

346
00:23:13.801 --> 00:23:17.690
the EOF nine a cougar wing airplane.
It's a,

347
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.260
it's a jet but it's lightened slow and kind of stodgy is a,

348
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:26.740
it's a Korean warping.
And,
and they were,

349
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.000
they were using it in flight training to teach instruments.

350
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.770
And the way they do this,

351
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:36.010
the instructor would sit in the front seat and the students sit in the back seat

352
00:23:36.011 --> 00:23:39.880
and they had a bag that,

353
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.280
that covered all the windows covered,
covered you up.

354
00:23:42.281 --> 00:23:46.880
All you could see was the instrument panel.
You're under this bag.
And so,

355
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:47.714
um,

356
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.200
and so we signed on to fly this airplane for test hops and check rides and this

357
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:59.600
kind of stuff just to fly that just stay in the air because we were already

358
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:00.560
qualified.
The airplane,

359
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.800
well Kooky and I would save a little bit of gas.
Okay.

360
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.800
Each time we'd fly these students around.
At the end of the hop,

361
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:11.450
we would lurk off the,

362
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.080
the coast of San Diego and wait for the phantom is to come out.

363
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.630
And,
uh,
so we,
you know,
we,

364
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.610
these guys would come off and run away at Miramar and they were heavy,
you know,

365
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:26.120
and they were stodgy and they were slow as they came off.

366
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.220
And they'd get about four or five miles out in the Pacific and we would pounce

367
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:33.120
on these guys.
And,
uh,

368
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.520
it was all kinds of fun because we were lighter and could turn quicker than the

369
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:42.080
fandoms.
You know,
we were a smaller,
we had a better wing load than they did.

370
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.730
And so we could turn inside these guys.
Of course,
they were much,
much faster.

371
00:24:46.731 --> 00:24:49.940
We were not supersonic,
and they were so they could get away from us in,

372
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.130
in a heartbeat if they wanted to.
But,
uh,
we,

373
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.800
we started this air combat maneuvering with these guys.
Well,

374
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.290
that went on for,
I don't know,
a couple of months until one day,
cookie and I,

375
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.380
I mean,
we played the role.
We had white scarves,
you know,

376
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.270
snoopy goggles and the whole works.

377
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.160
And when he came back and to the instruments squadron and checked in our

378
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:17.060
airplanes back in and the,
and it was signed on the Bolton Board,

379
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:22.330
plum creaky report to the f four commanding officer immediately,

380
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.080
uh,
we were in trouble.

381
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.000
So two to two guys and they're sweaty flight suits,

382
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.630
knock on the door of the commanding officer of the Phantom Squadron.

383
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.970
I'll never forget this scene.
The,
the,
uh,
the got come in and we opened the door.

384
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.740
This guy sits at a long desk.
Okay.
And Andy,

385
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:47.240
he's got glasses and of course he's an old,
old guy.
We were 23,
so,
you know,

386
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:50.080
he was probably 30,
but he,
the littlest guy you've ever talked to.

387
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.140
And so he's sitting there and talked to him at the top of his glasses.

388
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.600
He's in a sweaty flight suit also,
which should have been our first indication.

389
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.030
He said,

390
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:07.030
you two guys out there and the f nines Haslin my fighter pilots.
Um,

391
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.440
yes sir.
We were.
Um,

392
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.580
did you follow a phantom through an entire loop?
Uh,

393
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.740
yesterday.
In fact,
we did.
He said,

394
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.390
did you have your gun sights on that Phantom the entire time?
Um,
yeah.

395
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.040
Yes sir,
we did.
He said,
do you know who was in that Phantom?

396
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.400
He said,
I was,
he said,

397
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:31.850
I just came back from Vietnam are kill ratio over there is terrible.

398
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.770
They're eating our lunch.

399
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.270
We need to learn how to fight this airplane.
See,

400
00:26:38.271 --> 00:26:42.020
the f four was designed during the cold war as a supersonic intercept.

401
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.640
I was never a fighter pilot.
And in fact,

402
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:48.990
I trained in a space suit so I could go above 50,000 feet,

403
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.040
you know,
off the aircraft carrier,
climbed 80,000 feet,

404
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:55.120
shoot down the Russian bombers and you know,

405
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.670
at 45 degree angle of bank turn return to the aircraft carrier.

406
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.750
That was my job.

407
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.550
I wasn't supposed to be out there hassling cause because it was the Cold War,

408
00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:08.400
we did not expect to have,
uh,
a Korean War,

409
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:13.200
World War II type a hassle.
The fighter pilot.

410
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.890
Well,
of course Vietnam came around and suddenly,
you know,
they're,

411
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.470
they're flying these older airplanes that were eating our lunch.

412
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.960
So the CEO looked at us and he said,
you want to you in a fight with me tomorrow?

413
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.270
I'm all,
yes sir.
That'd be fun.

414
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.580
So for the next two or three months,
ball creaky and I,

415
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.570
with our white scarves and our snoopy goggles,
we get Nardo left.

416
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.240
We had to start about an hour ahead of time,
you know,

417
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:41.190
just because they were so fast.

418
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.540
But we'd get out to see if he'd go out to 40 miles out to sea and then turn

419
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:50.150
around and here they come.
And we'd had these two on two engagements and,

420
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.900
and that became a syllabus within the replacement air group.

421
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:59.750
But the air force that eventually became the top gun school.
That's awesome.
Yeah,

422
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.510
it was.
It was the start of a,
of retraining.
Well,
and it was,

423
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:04.920
it was very successful.

424
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.080
We turned our kill ratio around by teaching pilots how to fight this f four

425
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:11.460
phantom.
Yeah.

426
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.040
<v 3>Clearly that's it.
Without training to fight,</v>

427
00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:16.750
how are you going to know how to fight?
That's right.

428
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.600
And you gotta you gotta beat,
that's outstanding for the,

429
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.410
for the commanding officer,
that squadron to say,
you know what?
Instead of being,

430
00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.860
instead of being mad that you were doing it.
Instead he's humble and says,

431
00:28:26.861 --> 00:28:29.290
you know what?
We need to get better at this.
Yeah,
let's,
let's,

432
00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:31.210
let's keep training.
Yup.
That's awesome.

433
00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:35.050
And you eventually do get your time in the f four Phantom.

434
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.770
You've learned how to fly that and now it's time to go on deployment.

435
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.330
You're going on deployment now and November 5th,

436
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:48.070
1966 you kiss and goodbye and you go on deployment on the,

437
00:28:48.071 --> 00:28:50.950
on the Kitty Hawk.
It was her birthday.
Oh,

438
00:28:50.951 --> 00:28:54.040
that's a great birthday present officer.
Very nice of you.

439
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:58.270
It's like my first daughter,
my first daughter was born actual birthday.

440
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.660
Like actual birthday.
Yeah.
I went on deployment the next day.

441
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.270
Everyone was really happy with me on that one.

442
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.910
<v 2>When now when you were</v>

443
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.870
<v 3>going through the flight training and you were getting ready to deploy now,</v>

444
00:29:10.871 --> 00:29:12.400
were you thinking about Vietnam at all?
I mean,

445
00:29:12.401 --> 00:29:14.620
you must've been getting feedback when you got feedback from the commanding

446
00:29:14.621 --> 00:29:17.830
officer,
so now your focus had shifted something.
Yeah,
it certainly had.

447
00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:22.170
And the squadron that I joined was just coming back from Vietnam and they'd had

448
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.043
quite a few casual

449
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:27.020
<v 2>taste and uh,
and so they were talking about,
you know,
the guys were,</v>

450
00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:31.820
the guys were,
were giving us instruction on how to work that.

451
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.920
Another thing about the phantom was that we had,
uh,

452
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.620
we had no indication when a missile was in the air,
uh,

453
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.600
because we were faster than the missile for the most part are higher than the

454
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:45.790
missile.
And so one of the things the guys,

455
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.240
the guys told me that the fellows coming back from Vietnam said,

456
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.890
go down to radio shack and buy herself a Fuzzbuster,
you know?
Oh,
like,
oh,

457
00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:59.380
look,
police detective.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The old fuzzbuster.
Yeah,
it's a,
he said,

458
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:04.381
because the Russian built Sam surface to air missiles are on the same frequency

459
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:09.940
as a California highway patrol.
True.

460
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.770
True Story.
Uh,
and so we have found that if you,

461
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.400
because we have no indication in the airplane when a missile is in the air.

462
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.060
And so I did a mental radio shack by myself if fuzzbuster and uh,

463
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.350
it had little suction cup and you look the Suction Cup and you put it on the

464
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:32.860
windscreen and this,
this fandom and you run a little white wire,
you know,

465
00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:35.420
down underneath your a g suit and you're sore,

466
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.520
torsional harness and under your oxygen mask and,
and finally into your ear,

467
00:30:39.521 --> 00:30:42.250
you know,
you get your butt in there.

468
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:47.850
And so here I am flying this $20 million airplane being protected by a $29 first

469
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.820
buster.
So it worked.
But uh,

470
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.740
the problem was that there was no direction capability.

471
00:30:56.741 --> 00:31:00.340
You can tell where it was coming from.
And so,
you know,

472
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.150
it's almost a worst sideways psychologically.
Absolutely.

473
00:31:04.151 --> 00:31:08.770
You heard the warble and boy,
you know,
you started to turn and Jink and you know,

474
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:11.380
your,
your head went on a swivel trying to figure out where this,

475
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:16.590
this missile is you,
but you get overseas and you're,

476
00:31:16.591 --> 00:31:19.000
you're flying,
you start flying missions,
you're doing,

477
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.700
you're doing mostly strike missions.
Is that primarily what you're doing,

478
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.990
taking out targets in North Vietnam?
The four of course,

479
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.910
again was considered,

480
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:32.970
was configured and built from the Keel up as a a,

481
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.240
as an air to air combat machine.
All right.

482
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.160
The powers that be decided,
hey,
there's an airplane,
we can hang a bomb on it.

483
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:46.780
They put on an extra,
I believe four hardpoints in the bottom of this airplane,

484
00:31:46.781 --> 00:31:48.040
maybe five,
I can't remember.

485
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.480
So that we could carry bombs on this fighter airplane.

486
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.540
What we were supposed to be interceptors.

487
00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:57.520
We weren't supposed to be carrying bombs around,

488
00:31:57.521 --> 00:31:59.020
but we found out that sure enough,

489
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.370
this big ole airplane was a pretty good platform for,
for dropping bombs.

490
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.910
And so we could carry,
you know,
we could carry 12,

491
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:11.600
13,000 pounds of bombs into the target,
which was a pretty good load.
You know,

492
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.340
we can also support,
you know,
guys like you and the ground that,
uh,

493
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.630
with all kinds of various kinds of weaponry.

494
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.920
Um,

495
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.210
and so what happened was we had a sister squadron on the aircraft carrier.

496
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.820
So for a month line period,

497
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:32.050
we would be fighters for two weeks and then we would,
we would,

498
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.150
we would reconfigure airplane to be bombers and we'd be bombers for two weeks

499
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:39.930
and we would go back to fighters and then back monomers.
The,

500
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.640
and so to answer your question,
half the time over there,

501
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:47.580
I was dropping bombs and half the time I was uh,
I was uh,

502
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.710
doing the air to air

503
00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:52.440
<v 3>mission and the air to air mission primarily be doing combat air patrols to</v>

504
00:32:52.441 --> 00:32:55.230
support the other elements that were flying in with bombs.

505
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.140
And you'd be protected in case any mig showed up.
Exactly,
yeah.

506
00:32:58.141 --> 00:33:01.080
It was the CAAP a cap combat air patrol.

507
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.070
So you're pretty much

508
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.890
almost done with deployment where we're talking,
you,
you spend,
you did what,

509
00:33:10.891 --> 00:33:12.630
74 missions at this point.

510
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:17.660
You've been there for five or coming up on six months and on the 19th of May,

511
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:23.030
1967,
you get a phone call and you guys get like a,

512
00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:26.190
a strike mission comes in that you are supposed to execute.

513
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.070
<v 2>It was a big deal.
Uh,
and it was called an Alpha strike.</v>

514
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:34.340
And Alpha strike was the top priority.

515
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.880
And we knew that it would be a lot of airplanes in the air and we have some

516
00:33:37.881 --> 00:33:39.710
pretty important targets to hit.

517
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.840
And it was sanctioned straight from the Pentagon.
It was jcs stuff.
Uh,

518
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:49.250
and um,
which of course is one of the problems in that war was in most of our

519
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.650
instruction came from the guys,
uh,

520
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.500
back in the puzzle palace.
And,
uh,
I,
I,
it's,
you know,
they wouldn't,

521
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:02.530
they wouldn't let us decide targets or attitudes or anything else.

522
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.790
It was pretty well,
well planned by the time we got the go.

523
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:13.370
And I got a call,
I suppose three in the morning,
something like that,

524
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.550
saying that I was to schedule this flight.

525
00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:19.010
I was a scheduled so officer for the pro for the squadron.

526
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:24.010
And so I was the guy that figured out who went on what strikes and with whom and

527
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.330
in the airplanes that they head.
And so,

528
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.280
so I got up early to start planning this strike,
uh,

529
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.510
with the airplanes and the pilots and the back seeders our radar intercept

530
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:40.280
officers are copilots.
Um,
and,
and so I did.

531
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.760
Then we went to the briefing room and got about an hour brief on this,

532
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.800
these targets.
I later found out that the reason for the whole thing,

533
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:53.630
the reason why we were doing an Alpha strike on the 19th of May was it was the

534
00:34:53.631 --> 00:34:58.631
birthday of their president Holcim in and again,

535
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.180
exactly the brilliance of,
uh,
you know,

536
00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:06.260
of our PSI or Psi war,

537
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:07.423
um,

538
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.780
grades was that we would catch them in celebration of their,

539
00:35:13.781 --> 00:35:17.960
of the big day,
uh,
because they,
it was like our president's Day,

540
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:21.050
they had picnics and that kind of stuff.

541
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.670
And so we were going to catch them with their pants down.
Well,

542
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.660
as most things that happened in Vietnam,

543
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:30.710
they knew we were coming for whatever reason.
And,
uh,

544
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.860
that day they were eight f four phantom shot down.

545
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.910
But I'll never forget the beginning of it because,
um,
you know,

546
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:43.911
I took off and then a rendezvous with a tanker and took on an extra 3000 pounds

547
00:35:44.371 --> 00:35:47.400
of fuel and then joined this,
the squadron.

548
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.600
And it was in fact the cat mission.
It was a combat air patrol.

549
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:52.770
I was not carrying bombs.

550
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.180
So we had four of us on one side of the strike group and for the other and just

551
00:35:59.671 --> 00:36:04.330
to look because it was three aircraft carriers and five air force bases,

552
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.400
all just throwing everything we had at the end of me that day.
It was uh,

553
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:13.410
it was an amazing armada and I could see from one horizon to the other,

554
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.970
these airplanes and uh,

555
00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:20.040
and I remember feeling really proud,
you know,
man,

556
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.370
you know,

557
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:24.660
just to be a part of this doing something that very few people in the world

558
00:36:24.661 --> 00:36:29.090
would ever do.
Um,
and flying this airplane,
um,

559
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.970
at age 24.
And uh,
so that,

560
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:35.040
that was how it all began on the 19th of May.

561
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.170
At one of the things that we were talking about just before we hit record was

562
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.030
the kind of the sense of humor that you have in the military and,

563
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:47.640
and what that's like.
And one of the,
by the way,

564
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:50.820
I haven't even mentioned that referring to a book that you wrote called,

565
00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:54.390
I'm no hero by Charlie plumb and that'll be,

566
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.120
that's available on Amazon.
Get it through.

567
00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.860
It'd be link on the website but also book actually better on my website because

568
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:06.210
I sign everyone that a that goes out.
So my website,
Charlie plumb.com.
Okay,

569
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.130
well there you go.
Even better

570
00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.760
<v 3>did the book here you guys are getting before you launch you're getting ready to</v>

571
00:37:13.761 --> 00:37:16.130
launch kind of getting ready for the briefing and here we go.

572
00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.090
The pilots of the fighter planes gathered in their own briefing room and read

573
00:37:20.091 --> 00:37:23.900
from a television screen and teletype the weather information and the position

574
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:27.800
of the ship we reviewed once again the switches we would have to throw and I

575
00:37:27.801 --> 00:37:31.010
coordinated with the maintenance officer,
the weapons we would need,

576
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:35.810
the volume of the fuel,
etc. Serious thoughts were in the back of all our minds,

577
00:37:35.811 --> 00:37:40.070
but outwardly our mood was light.
We laughed and joked,

578
00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:43.640
drank coffee and smoked my regular Rio,

579
00:37:43.641 --> 00:37:47.450
which is the radar intercept officer does their backseater cause the the f four

580
00:37:47.451 --> 00:37:52.340
Phantom has two people was up to his old habit of manipulating his slide rule

581
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.190
being a self styled math wizard.

582
00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:00.370
He again pinpointed his likelihood of getting bagged or shot down.

583
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:06.010
This was based on some speculative formula he had found somewhere today.

584
00:38:06.381 --> 00:38:07.010
Friends,

585
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:12.010
he proclaimed my bag factor is 0.019376 and then you reply to them then save me

586
00:38:15.891 --> 00:38:20.510
a room at the Hanoi Hilton.
Again.

587
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:25.310
I'm glad you're still laughing about that sir.
Uh,
the rest of you,

588
00:38:25.311 --> 00:38:29.060
as we go through this book,
we'll see the true irony in that joke.
Uh,

589
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.790
you know,
back to the book here,

590
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:36.040
we left our ready room and entered the central briefing room where all the Reos

591
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:37.960
and standby crew scrutinize their master plan,

592
00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:40.930
which included maps and photographs of the targets and intelligence for sports

593
00:38:40.931 --> 00:38:44.410
of enemies fire capability.
After our central briefing,

594
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.850
we returned to our ready room,

595
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:50.350
meditated last minute instructions and put it on our flight gear altogether.

596
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:54.430
These briefings took as long and sometimes longer than the mission itself.

597
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.890
I looked up at the screen pilots,
man,
your aircraft,
we gave each other,

598
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.460
we slapped each other on the back,
the exchange of customary,

599
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:08.461
give him hell dialogue and patted the posterior of our good luck girl hanging on

600
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:11.800
the door.
It was time to go top side.

601
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.800
You guys are now getting ready to take off and again,
just some of this,

602
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.870
this humor back to the book engine run up as good takeoff checklist is complete.

603
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:27.190
I'm ready to go,
Gary.
You Ready?
Yeah,
I'm ready.
Okay.
I mocked,

604
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.930
this is your captain speaking.

605
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.070
Welcome to flight four oh three to annoy north Vietnam will be flying an

606
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:35.800
altitude of 11 grand and we have a high ceiling.

607
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.610
Make sure your seat belt is fastened.
No Smoking please.

608
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.360
So that's the attitude going out and legitimately yours.

609
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.310
This is your 75th mission.

610
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.280
You've just flown 74 you're feeling pretty comfortable.

611
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:53.230
I mean even though of course you've got thoughts in the back of your mind,

612
00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:56.380
but you're feeling pretty comfortable about how you do your job and what you get

613
00:39:56.381 --> 00:40:00.130
done.
I am feeling bulletproof.
I wasn't going to go that far,

614
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:04.070
but let's just go there because I know that feeling to

615
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:11.620
the,
as you push in back to the book,
all this coordination,

616
00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:15.520
so it's what you just talked about,
this massive effort going forward,

617
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.110
dozens and dozens of aircraft,

618
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.070
all of this coordination of and machinery during the refueling was done in

619
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:23.350
complete silence.
We called it zip lip.

620
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.560
Although enemy radar would have already detected us.

621
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:30.010
We were careful not to give radio spooks any additional information.

622
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:34.750
It was gratifying to experience such close rapport with my airwing.

623
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.930
I knew and they knew what each was doing in this intricate maneuver yet not a

624
00:40:39.971 --> 00:40:43.790
word had to be spoken and that's,
I've,

625
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:46.720
I've actually talked about that on here when we would train and when I was

626
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:49.870
running training for,
for the seals,
I would tell them,
hey,

627
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:52.270
you're not allowed to talk during this training mission or you can't say one

628
00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:55.720
word to each other and it was amazing.
After you do that a couple times,

629
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:58.810
how much better people get cause they're reading,
they're reacting,

630
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.520
they're anticipating one other people are going to do.

631
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:03.190
And you guys are just so far ahead at this point,

632
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.680
five and a half months into deployment,
it's,

633
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.230
you guys are doing this whole thing without saying a word to each other.

634
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.070
It was amazing.
Yeah.

635
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.900
I think that's one of the,

636
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.130
one of the incredible things about the military as you,

637
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.540
even though you're just a little piece of that big machine,

638
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:23.830
this big powerful machine,
it's,
it's,
it's pretty awesome to experience when you,

639
00:41:23.831 --> 00:41:24.940
when that stuff's going on

640
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.430
and you kind of talked about what,
what you were doing,

641
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:34.010
you are positioned on the flanks anticipating,
how often do you

642
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.330
<v 0>guys see it</v>

643
00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:37.270
<v 2>migs there not,
uh,
not often.</v>

644
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.870
I had seen migs probably four or five times up to that point.

645
00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:46.570
And um,
so they,
they,
they really were,
they were,

646
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.470
they were really good about not showing up until they knew that they could kill

647
00:41:50.471 --> 00:41:54.010
something.
No.
Uh,
of course they were,
they had the advantage,

648
00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:58.420
they had the home field advantage and so they could wait on their basis until we

649
00:41:58.421 --> 00:42:00.910
came to them and then they would launch.

650
00:42:00.911 --> 00:42:03.130
So if you didn't get close to a Mig base,

651
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.900
you probably weren't going to see what they were.
They had a very short range,
uh,

652
00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:11.680
and,
and uh,
they didn't see in the air very long.
And so,
uh,

653
00:42:11.681 --> 00:42:12.640
we didn't see him very often.

654
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.010
<v 0>And on this one,
you get a call though,
you here,
they don't,</v>

655
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.320
they give you a call for,
there's migs,
what does it migs it 20,

656
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:24.620
20 west and you start to get a little aggressive start leading out that way a

657
00:42:25.861 --> 00:42:27.400
little bit,
right?
Yup,
Yup.

658
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.910
The flight commander tighten you up and said,
hey,
plumb,

659
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.460
get back over information.

660
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:38.630
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
you know,
uh,
my,
uh,</v>

661
00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:43.720
my best buddy there at any wisely,
he had already shot down two airplanes,
uh,

662
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:47.200
by that time and he shot it down another one after I was shot down.
Uh,

663
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:52.000
and so he,
it,
and,
you know,
I mean,
that's what every fighter pilot wants to,

664
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.200
you know,
to have a Mig to his credit.
And I saw this opportunity,
you know,

665
00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:59.410
five days to go,
you know,
this is,
this is my,
this is my day,
you know,

666
00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:00.520
this is Charlie Plumb Day.

667
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.730
So I started ease out of the squadron so that I would be the first to go after

668
00:43:06.731 --> 00:43:10.510
this Mig.
And,
uh,
it's,
you're only plums are going to get his,

669
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:16.690
that's what happens.
But no,
that,
that,
that's,
that's how it began.

670
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.150
<v 0>And the,
and they tied you back up,</v>

671
00:43:18.151 --> 00:43:23.151
so you fall back into formation and now there's a sense,

672
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.070
is there a Sam call?
Did you pick it up on the,
on the fuzzbuster?

673
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.710
<v 2>I did,
but there were a lot of them in the air and,
and uh,
and,</v>

674
00:43:31.711 --> 00:43:36.590
and so that thing was warbling all the time.
Um,
they were,
they were,

675
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.130
they were salvo in there.
Sam's that day,
they just,

676
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.220
they just shoot a bunch of them off at the same time.

677
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:47.330
And so every time they shot one off,
then every time their radar would scan me,

678
00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:51.500
I would get to fuzzbuster.
But we also had,
you know,

679
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.720
we had the uh,
um,

680
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.510
the big radar airplanes in the sky at the same time and,
and,

681
00:43:58.511 --> 00:44:01.940
and they would call us and that's how I got that call,

682
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.090
that 20 mile away call was,
uh,
was,

683
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:10.100
was from our electronic folks that were flying well above us with the radar.

684
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:16.830
<v 0>So you know that there's Sam surface to air missiles up there and here we go</v>

685
00:44:17.771 --> 00:44:19.540
back to the book,
Gary,
that's your,

686
00:44:19.541 --> 00:44:22.870
that's your real sitting behind you in the plane.
You say,
Gary,
do you see it?

687
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:27.880
And he says,
I don't see a thing,
Charlie.
We both seen Sam's before.

688
00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:32.550
They resembled flying white telephone poles with huge 4th of July

689
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:37.320
<v 3>sparklers.
Spring Silvery orange glows from their tails.
If we saw them in time,</v>

690
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:41.760
we could dodge the missiles by letting them close in at the last second,

691
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:46.350
polling the plane into a high g barrel roll,
six g's or so,

692
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.310
and letting the polls pass harmlessly underneath because if it's designed to

693
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:52.920
missile,
could not follow us without cracking into,

694
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.780
but we didn't see it.
Boom.

695
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.620
I felt a thump and the orphanage,
the half section of the airplane,

696
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:06.890
airplane read instrument lights jumped across the panel indicating that I had

697
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:10.050
two engines on fire that wasn't good.

698
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.150
This plane only had two engines.

699
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.680
I yanked the throttles back to idle and the birds seem to come to an immediate

700
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:19.770
halt in midair.
Charlie were hit.
How bad is it?

701
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.810
She's still flying.

702
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:26.550
Then the aircraft started a role and while I mad we scanned the instruments.

703
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.570
I looked up and found that the f four it's suddenly overturned.

704
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.850
Ground was where there was where there should have been sky and the nose was

705
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:39.780
heading downward,
ripping air at 500 knots.

706
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:45.410
The altimeter needle collapse to 4,000 then 3,500 than 3000 we had to get out,

707
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.180
but being inverted,

708
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.840
we would be rocketed by the ejection seat right into the rice patties.

709
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.950
I had rolled the plane upright.
I tried to stick.
It was frozen.

710
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.260
The only manual control was the rudder pedal.

711
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.610
Not normally used to roll an aircraft.
I stepped on it as hard as I could.

712
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:07.680
Adrenaline surging through my veins.
The plane shuttered once and again.

713
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.650
Slowly it began to write itself.

714
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.430
Rear view mirrors reflected a screaming fireball.

715
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:19.610
12,000 pounds of framing gasoline in 30,000 pounds of fissionable aircraft.

716
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.630
You want to eject?
No.
Wait a minute.
I shouted back.

717
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:30.000
The plane struggled than the sky was where it should be.
Gary,

718
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.690
let's go.
I jerked my face curtain to eject.

719
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.030
The rockets slam me out of the aircraft.

720
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.350
I tumbled a couple of times and the shoot caught just as advertised.

721
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:45.450
All kinds of debris filled the air around me as wadding from the shells whistled

722
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:47.970
by son of a gun.

723
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:50.940
They've backed my airplane now thereafter,
me,

724
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.680
I went to the concussions from the exploding shells.
Sonic booms,

725
00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:59.580
battering my year drums,
rockets of heavy smoke,
clouds of the sky,

726
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:03.180
dairy and I had adjusted,
ejected so near the ground,
however,

727
00:47:03.181 --> 00:47:06.450
that enemy guns could train on us.
For only a short time.

728
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.110
I checked my parachute canopy.
It looked good.

729
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:14.250
Torn in only a couple of places I thought of escape,

730
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.470
but were looking away.

731
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.650
I saw my buddies and their aircraft to blending into the horizon.

732
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.760
Below my landing zone was nothing but bear in rice patties down to my left,

733
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:30.010
a huge cloud of black smoke billowed at the outskirts of

734
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.730
<v 0>a peasant.
Hamlet punctuating a row of four or five cuts.</v>

735
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:37.960
My plane had it wiped out a family.
If so,

736
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:43.090
the villagers would certainly be unhappy.
I wasn't happy either.

737
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.770
I hadn't intended that to happen.

738
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:50.380
I later learned that the plan the plane had impacted just beyond the last shack

739
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:54.820
on the road.
There was precious little time before I could touch down,

740
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:58.090
before I would touch down and I had much to be done.

741
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:03.250
I grabbed my two way radio and tried to contact Gary,
but I received no answer.

742
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.540
Then I called my skipper Lynnfield lead Lynnfield lead.

743
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.410
This is Lynnfield too.
We've got two good shoots.

744
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.850
We're going to be all right.

745
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:17.230
Request no SAR effort.

746
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.870
And Sar is search and rescue.
For those of you that don't know.

747
00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:30.100
And I,
when I read that part right there,

748
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:34.450
I stopped in my tracks because here you are,
you're shot down,

749
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:36.220
you're in a parachute,

750
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:40.240
you're going to obviously be landing in these rice patties surrounded by enemy.

751
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.200
And you had the wherewithal to understand that if you requested for search and

752
00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:50.440
rescue to come and get you,
it was just going to get more people killed.

753
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:54.680
<v 2>Yeah.
Uh,
and that had happened before.
Uh,
I,
I'd seen,</v>

754
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:59.660
I had seen that happen and uh,
we were so far behind.

755
00:48:59.661 --> 00:49:04.450
Enemy lines mean it was impossible.
A jolly green was that,
what was it called,

756
00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:08.930
science for the helicopter that would come get us off the aircraft carrier and

757
00:49:08.931 --> 00:49:10.350
they would have to go through,
uh,

758
00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:15.460
probably a 75 or 100 miles of enemy territory before they ever got to me.

759
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.230
And,
uh,
and,

760
00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:22.880
and I was in such a populated area that I could see that they were,

761
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:26.390
that I was going to be captured immediately.
And so to get those guys,

762
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.390
to put them in harm's way was,
um,
it was kind of selling.

763
00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.040
So that's why I did that.

764
00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:33.470
<v 0>When,
you know,</v>

765
00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:38.180
I've experienced a couple times in combat where things slow down and the time

766
00:49:38.181 --> 00:49:41.690
starts to,
to really be different than it normally is.

767
00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:44.150
And they say it's because you get this big adrenaline dump and all of your

768
00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:45.320
sensors,
all your,

769
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:49.350
your perception awakens to such a high point that things actually slow down.

770
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:53.150
Did you experience any of that when you were,
once that Sam missile hit?

771
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:58.050
<v 2>I did,
yes.
Uh,
it was almost like slow motion and I,
you know,</v>

772
00:49:58.051 --> 00:50:02.900
and I remember thinking this is unreal.
I,
I,
I've,

773
00:50:02.901 --> 00:50:06.360
I've never had this happen to me before,
but it was almost like I was in a,

774
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.680
it was an iMovie and everything was slowing down in my life.
Um,

775
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:16.320
and,
uh,
and I,
you know,
I tried to,
since every possible thing,

776
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:19.270
because of course I'm thinking escape now,
trying to get it,

777
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.580
get out of here in some way.

778
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:25.170
And so I'm trying to memorize all the little roads I could see in all the little

779
00:50:25.171 --> 00:50:28.990
trees and all little Hudson.
Where are they in,
where am I that situation?

780
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.940
Situational awareness.
How far from the water in the ocean,

781
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:35.630
where you at the school?
I was 75 miles,
no chance of that.
And no chance.

782
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:43.030
We were on the outskirts of Hanoi,
the capital city and,
uh,
and,
and,

783
00:50:43.031 --> 00:50:44.660
and that was the bad news.
Good News.

784
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.440
The bad news was that I was going to be captured immediately.

785
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:50.540
There was no chance whatsoever.
I mean,

786
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:53.980
they were shooting at me from the ground while I came down.
Uh,

787
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.800
the good news was I didn't have to go very far to the,

788
00:50:56.801 --> 00:51:00.170
to a formalized prison camp like a lot of the guys did,
you know,

789
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:04.910
you had bill reader on this,
on your podcast and he was dragged for,
I dunno,

790
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:08.570
weeks.
Um,
and,
uh,
because he was the,

791
00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:10.600
he was captured in South Vietnam,
right?

792
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:15.260
The guys that were in Laos or Cambodia who were brought to our prison camps were

793
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:20.240
all just really torn up,
not just because of,
um,

794
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:25.310
of the enemy,
but just because of the rigors of the travel.

795
00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.670
<v 0>So,
and you're going to,
you're going to talk about this,</v>

796
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:31.070
you talk about in the book,
but you know,

797
00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:36.071
just to kind of point out the fact that whatever,

798
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:39.020
two minutes earlier,

799
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:44.410
you were part of this giant powerful force with a multimillion dollar aircraft

800
00:51:46.761 --> 00:51:51.440
under your command is a 24 year old as part of this group that have many,

801
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:56.270
many multimillion dollar with this huge destructive power launching off of these

802
00:51:56.271 --> 00:51:58.500
ships and airfields.

803
00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:03.500
And to go from having all that to now you're under a parachute and you're about

804
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:07.100
to have all of that just absolutely taken away.

805
00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:10.860
<v 2>It was a major transition in my life,</v>

806
00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:17.330
but I,
you know,
uh,
unlike,
unlike someone who's diagnosed with cancer,
right?

807
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:22.170
You know,
or like someone who,
who just lost a job or uh,

808
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:26.340
just lots of child or just had a car accident.
I mean that's,
you know,

809
00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:29.820
there are similarities in normal civilian life.

810
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:33.150
I think that can be just as impactive as being blown out of the sky.

811
00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:34.203
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

812
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:38.600
you're floating down to earth and I'm going back to the book.

813
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:41.990
Then I bowed my head,
well,
Lord,
here I am.

814
00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.380
I'm really in a bind now and I need some help.

815
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:49.040
Give me strength and give an strength.

816
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.930
I was surprised at how calm I was when I should've been panic stricken,

817
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.810
but there was too much to think about and do.

818
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.330
I couldn't let myself become irrational.

819
00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.180
It would all be different now.

820
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.960
I tried to envision myself in this new world and prepare for it.

821
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.780
I had a lot going for me.

822
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:12.980
I was in good physical condition and I could probably withstand torture.

823
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:17.450
I didn't believe I would be killed because I was too much of a blue chip for the

824
00:53:17.451 --> 00:53:18.284
enemy.

825
00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:24.810
Which again for you to say you're,
you're shot down,

826
00:53:24.811 --> 00:53:27.960
you're to land in enemy territory and your statement is,
I had a lot going.

827
00:53:27.961 --> 00:53:31.160
For me.
It's a positive attitude.
Circuits.
It's a positive attitude.

828
00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:35.190
That's your philosophy of saying good as my notes right there.

829
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:39.600
I wrote good knock this before,

830
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:43.890
so you've touched down.

831
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.940
I plunged backward into the mud and water trying to get my bearings.

832
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:49.770
I took off my helmet and mask and crawled out,

833
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.160
crawled without direction in the quagmire with slimy hands.

834
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:54.630
I tried to wipe mud from my eyes.

835
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:57.600
I saw that I was about 10 or 15 yards from an embankment.

836
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.890
I looked over to see that Gary touching down or an adjacent patty about 100

837
00:54:01.891 --> 00:54:05.130
yards away had disappeared behind the eight foot embankment,

838
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.520
a barefoot peasant wearing khaki shirts,

839
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.540
shorts and t shirt ran at top speed down the path toward me,

840
00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:16.620
grimacing with excitement and anger above his head.

841
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:20.820
He waved a double edged acts with blades about eight inches long.

842
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.900
My instructors never documented that type of weapon.

843
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.810
I heard him scream hand up,
hanging up.

844
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:31.740
I didn't understand what he meant and I kept working with my gear and shoot.

845
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.400
I had a 38 revolver strapped to my chest and it,

846
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.900
and as long as he stayed in the embankment,
I would not touch it.
It wasn't long.

847
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:40.351
However,

848
00:54:40.351 --> 00:54:44.280
before 10 or 12 more peasants came rushing toward me yelling and waving their

849
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.390
shovels and hoes.

850
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.070
Now there was power in numbers and they charged out in the water after me.

851
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:53.790
I raised my hands away from my body.
They started ripping my g suit,

852
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.470
found my survival knife,

853
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:58.710
and proceeded to cut away at the suit and the torso harness.

854
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:02.370
I tried to tell them to use the zippers and even attempted to show them how to

855
00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:04.350
do it,
but they knocked my hands away.

856
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.200
The more certain they were that I was harmless,
the meaner they became.

857
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:15.120
The shovel and hold blades flailed up my body to prove to me that I was there.

858
00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:16.470
Loath captain

859
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:18.543
<v 1>captive.</v>

860
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.910
<v 0>Strangely,
the peasants failed to see my revolver,</v>

861
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:26.890
probably because it too was covered with mud and the 38 restaurant in my holster

862
00:55:26.891 --> 00:55:29.830
at least three or four minutes before a peasant finally spotted it.

863
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.890
He yanked it out of the holster and slashed a few steps away.

864
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.300
A moment later,
he returned and screamed for special attention.

865
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.090
You fixed the barrel to my head,

866
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.600
I could see that at least two of the chambers were empty.

867
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:50.140
I had always kept five of the six chambers loaded,

868
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:53.890
so I knew that he must've removed at least one of the cartridges.

869
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:58.840
There was little I could do as I felt the muddy barrel against my temple.

870
00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:01.930
The peasant pulled the trigger

871
00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.393
<v 1>click.</v>

872
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:10.260
<v 0>He could fought and sneaked away wiping off his unexpected prize.</v>

873
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:24.100
You're
as far as

874
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.070
<v 2>your thoughts about being killed at that moment,</v>

875
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:34.080
did you accept them that you will use this thinking he's not going to do it?

876
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.630
What's your attitude at that point?

877
00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:41.070
I'd never in the entire experience and never thought I was going to be killed

878
00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.890
and I didn't think so.
Thanks.
So at that moment,

879
00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.430
of course I was very happy with it.
I heard the click of that revolver,

880
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.750
but uh,
but it was anger.

881
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:55.910
It was actually very encouraging to think that they were going to feign this,

882
00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:02.500
uh,
execution and not go through with it.
And,
uh,

883
00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.820
it was encouraging to me to think that yeah,

884
00:57:05.821 --> 00:57:08.280
they were going to hammer me around and get me pretty bloody,

885
00:57:08.281 --> 00:57:11.220
but they probably weren't intentionally going to kill me.

886
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:16.130
I guess I worried more about that.
They would kill me accidentally,
uh,

887
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.260
then intentionally,
but,

888
00:57:19.261 --> 00:57:22.280
and there were two or three times during the entire experience was one of them

889
00:57:22.281 --> 00:57:24.450
is while I was being tortured a how,

890
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:30.320
when I felt like I was losing it and I was close to death and they,

891
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:35.460
they loosened the ropes,
uh,
because they saw,

892
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:40.110
I think that I was getting pretty close to death.
And so,
uh,

893
00:57:40.111 --> 00:57:42.150
and that,
you know,
again,

894
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:46.620
that was good because I bet.
All right,
uh,

895
00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:49.680
this is hurts a lot,
but it looks like they're not going to kill me.

896
00:57:49.681 --> 00:57:52.230
I may wish I was dead,
but I don't think they're going to do it.

897
00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:58.780
<v 0>Now you guys are blindfolded.
They take capture Gary as well and there you're,</v>

898
00:57:58.890 --> 00:57:59.790
you're blindfolded.

899
00:57:59.791 --> 00:58:04.410
But at this point they put this kind of marginal blindfold on you that's not

900
00:58:04.411 --> 00:58:08.550
working really well.
So you can actually see,
and again,
I'm going to go to your,

901
00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:13.170
um,
go ahead and highlight your twisted sense of humor here.

902
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.600
So here we go.
Uh,
you're in the back of an old Russian jeep.
Back to the book.

903
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:21.990
Gary was held captive in the jeep ahead of mine at the incident.

904
00:58:21.991 --> 00:58:22.950
I recognize Gary.

905
00:58:22.951 --> 00:58:26.640
I started calling hysterically for a doctor to tend to his burned arms.

906
00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:32.010
The guards restrained me violently screaming foreign but distinct warnings to

907
00:58:32.011 --> 00:58:35.730
attempt no more communication.
I did however,

908
00:58:35.731 --> 00:58:39.480
shout one more thing.
I don't know why,
unless it was for morale.

909
00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:44.590
I shouted out these people or a thousand years behind in blindfolds

910
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.880
and it says later the POW is who were nearby cells.
Heard,

911
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:55.040
heard you screaming that and still laughed about it.
So,
uh,

912
00:58:55.290 --> 00:58:57.110
I'm glad you kept your sense of humor.
You know,

913
00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:59.850
<v 2>sometimes I look back on that and think that I,</v>

914
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:04.420
that I was in some form of shock because I mean,
who would,

915
00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:09.190
<v 0>who would come up with that would,
who would write this stuff?</v>

916
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.700
And uh,
they,
they bring,

917
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:18.640
they bring you in it from kind of parade you guys around and you hear camera's

918
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:23.641
clicking and eventually you get put into new guy village and you get put into,

919
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:28.430
you know,
a torture basically of torture room.
So here we go.
Back to the book,

920
00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:32.600
several torture cells and the prison,
the Green Nabi Room,

921
00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:36.950
so called because the walls and ceiling were covered with gobs of plaster,

922
00:59:36.951 --> 00:59:41.690
the size of golf balls,
which looked somewhat like mud,
dobber nests.

923
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.270
The globs had a particular function,

924
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:49.370
acoustics to muffle human sound.

925
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.630
Now you get through this day sunset,

926
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:56.660
I had difficulty in seeing what was beyond myself.

927
00:59:56.810 --> 01:00:00.290
So I began reminiscing about the world of active life.

928
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:04.280
I have loved so much outside my,

929
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:06.920
every minute had been filled outside.

930
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.160
I had been king the skies outside.

931
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.880
I had been continually learning,
doing,
accomplishing.

932
01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.320
I had been proud,
so very proud.

933
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.540
And now I was tired,
so tired,
so perplexed,

934
01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.930
so confined,
so very lonely.

935
01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:34.700
The trauma of overwhelming changed caused my mind to reel with this orientation.

936
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:36.390
<v 4>Okay?</v>

937
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:39.090
<v 0>I was afraid.
I stared at the emptiness.</v>

938
01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:42.780
Shadows crept up the walls gradually becoming more pronounced.

939
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.700
Curiously,
a vague ghostlike impression materialized.

940
01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.730
The image took the appearance of the master with arms outstretched,

941
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:57.330
a symbol.
It was strange,

942
01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.090
yet something I felt I should expect.

943
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.130
I began to utter the first lines of the 23rd psalm.

944
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.740
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

945
01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.310
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

946
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.650
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.

947
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.800
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

948
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:28.090
I repeated it allowed several times,
not because of any deep religious drive,

949
01:01:28.091 --> 01:01:30.940
but because it's simply seemed the thing to do.

950
01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:38.010
And then I prayed.
I considered making a deal with God,

951
01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:40.740
but rejected the idea.

952
01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.020
I made no big promises and asked for no miracles.

953
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:48.030
Just strength.

954
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:49.600
<v 4>Okay.</v>

955
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.470
<v 0>Strength to endure the hardship and strength from my wife,
Anne.</v>

956
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:56.900
It'd be difficult for her to,

957
01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.490
<v 4>okay.</v>

958
01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:01.700
<v 0>Yea though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of death.</v>

959
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:06.350
That was certainly where I was

960
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:17.870
an interesting point here is that in Colonel Readers podcast,

961
01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:23.060
uh,
you found the same thing that he went to the 23rd psalm then,
um,

962
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.630
uh,
and again it was just almost like,

963
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.100
well this is what I should do.

964
01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.133
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

965
01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:33.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

966
01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:38.820
Well I say there's no atheists in foxholes and I guess there aren't any in the

967
01:02:39.371 --> 01:02:42.550
prison camp,
although you do talk about some atheists in the prison camp.

968
01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:46.420
I do as a matter of fact come with a couple of guys to consider themselves

969
01:02:46.421 --> 01:02:48.710
atheist and,
and you know,
the,

970
01:02:48.711 --> 01:02:52.420
you also talk about faith and one of the things that I am glad we'll get to
this,

971
01:02:52.421 --> 01:02:55.030
but when you talk about faith,
your,

972
01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:58.570
you talk about faith not just in God,

973
01:02:58.571 --> 01:03:03.070
but faith in your country and all the one that I think that regardless of what

974
01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:07.090
someone's religious beliefs,
our faith in yourself.
Absolutely.

975
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:10.900
And I think all three of those or whichever one of those faiths where you find

976
01:03:10.901 --> 01:03:14.530
strength in times like this,
lean on it.

977
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:20.040
Absolutely.
And,
and,
you know,
faith in the team as well.

978
01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:24.120
We had to have faith in each other and that was awfully important to,
you know,

979
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:27.790
to be a part of a group like that that could trust one another.

980
01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:32.160
How quickly did you realize that there was,
that you were part of that?

981
01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:35.710
I guess we'll get to it,
but I mean,
when you first got your in this room,

982
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.520
did you feel completely isolated at first?
And there's no one else here?
No.
No.

983
01:03:39.521 --> 01:03:43.210
I knew that two or other prisoners there,
I could hear them.
Uh,
you know,

984
01:03:43.211 --> 01:03:47.620
some of them were being tortured as I was.
I could hear the torture.
I could.
Um,

985
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.210
you know,
I,

986
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:52.750
I could peek out sometimes and see them walking by my cell.

987
01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.810
So I knew there were other prisoners in the area and they just wouldn't let me,

988
01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.940
they would let me talk to them.

989
01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:04.100
So the interrogation begins,

990
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:10.520
the torture begins.
We're going back to the book,
we read copy regulations.

991
01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:15.080
You obey,
you live no trouble.
Okay.

992
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.320
I did not respond.
First Regulation,
you answer all questions.

993
01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.570
The way that the north Vietnamese justified torture was peculiar.

994
01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:30.620
When they asked me questions and wanted military answers,

995
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:36.040
I was not tortured to answer questions but punished for disobeying camp

996
01:04:36.051 --> 01:04:39.530
regulations.
What?
What airplane?
You fly.

997
01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.830
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you.

998
01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:46.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

999
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:48.090
<v 0>Lamb and they were calling you lamb.</v>

1000
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.310
What airplane to answer this question was of course not in my rules.

1001
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.900
I'm sorry.
I can't answer that.

1002
01:04:56.250 --> 01:05:01.020
The officer again reminded me about the punishment for disobeying camp rules.

1003
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1004
01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:06.950
<v 0>Okay.
You talk me or you talk steel</v>

1005
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:11.000
to which you responded.
Bring it on.

1006
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:13.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1007
01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.520
<v 0>The two higher ranking officials left the remaining officer with one word</v>

1008
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.170
ordered the guards forward.

1009
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:26.220
They brought it on the steel mentioned by the interrogator consistent of iron

1010
01:05:27.011 --> 01:05:29.500
manacles,
shackles and a leg bar.

1011
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.390
The shackles were cylindrical iron bars shaped like horse shoes but rounded at

1012
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:39.010
the end so that the five foot leg bar could be slipped into them and locked the

1013
01:05:39.011 --> 01:05:39.241
prisoner.

1014
01:05:39.241 --> 01:05:43.480
His ankles could then be forced through the openings and secured by the bar.

1015
01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:49.620
The junior officer walked out,
guards blindfolded me,

1016
01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:52.770
forced my wrists behind my back and place the open jaws.

1017
01:05:52.771 --> 01:05:54.090
The medicals around them.

1018
01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:00.050
These had obviously been intended for the more modest Vietnamese arms.

1019
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:04.310
They were so small that they had to be forced together just so the screw could

1020
01:06:04.311 --> 01:06:09.311
be seated in the bottom of the threads with what looked like a roller skate key

1021
01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.840
or guard began to turn the screw.

1022
01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:16.910
My skin was pinched between the metal and quickly succumb to the vice.

1023
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:18.590
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1024
01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:19.790
<v 0>I screamed in agony.</v>

1025
01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:23.810
Surely the guards wouldn't get these things much tighter.

1026
01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.600
Blood ooze down my hands and steal.

1027
01:06:27.601 --> 01:06:31.550
The guard kept turning the key like powerful magnets.

1028
01:06:31.551 --> 01:06:33.500
The iron was finally set,

1029
01:06:33.501 --> 01:06:38.501
flush circulation stopped my hands burned grayish blue tingled and became numb

1030
01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.170
regard.

1031
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:48.740
Then wrap the rope first round my left elbow and then around my right and drew

1032
01:06:48.741 --> 01:06:50.810
my elbows together behind my back,

1033
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:57.190
my shoulder muscles writhed and I feared that my sternum would separate.

1034
01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:02.930
I gasp for air.
Then I was thrown abruptly to the floor.

1035
01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:07.610
Shackles were jammed around my ankles and the leg bar was fastened and
padlocked.

1036
01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:09.170
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1037
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:12.590
<v 0>Electric wires similar to the kind that I had hidden underneath the table was</v>

1038
01:07:12.591 --> 01:07:13.424
brought forward.

1039
01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.750
I thought that the guards were going to use this to shock me,

1040
01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:19.250
but typical of the Vietnamese,

1041
01:07:19.251 --> 01:07:24.110
they didn't have anything else to use for rope and it torn the wire down from

1042
01:07:24.111 --> 01:07:28.610
some light fixtures.
This became the apparatus to wrap me up.

1043
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:33.920
It was first tied to the manacles than thrown over my shoulder and at last

1044
01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:36.170
secure to the shackles around my ankles.

1045
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:42.110
Guards forced a bamboo Paul under the wire and started rotating it so that the

1046
01:07:42.111 --> 01:07:43.280
wire contracted,

1047
01:07:43.281 --> 01:07:48.110
bringing my wrists up high on my back and drawing my face completely to my

1048
01:07:48.111 --> 01:07:52.200
ankles.
Oh was a human pretzel,

1049
01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:57.240
a Tea Cup with arms for a handle and the rest of my distorted body for the ball

1050
01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:02.160
circulation was impaired throughout my limbs,

1051
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.470
making them extremely painful to the touch.

1052
01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.750
The guards apparently drugged,
exhibited wide and glassy eyes.

1053
01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.920
They maliciously kicked me in the sides,
the limbs,

1054
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.230
the back and the head giggling and having a great time.

1055
01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:24.960
They picked me up a few feet from the floor,
dropped me since I was on my side.

1056
01:08:24.961 --> 01:08:29.550
Most of the time they especially enjoyed standing on my head symbolically

1057
01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.660
victorious.

1058
01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:34.770
The rubber tire saw sandals tore at my ear,

1059
01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:39.900
my face already target for abusers,
repeatedly subjected to fisticuffs and kicks.

1060
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.120
I remember staring at the floor and seeing my tears dropping the pools of blood

1061
01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.380
coming from my nose.

1062
01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:47.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1063
01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:50.820
<v 0>The louder I screamed,
the more they flailed.</v>

1064
01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:55.200
After about an hour,
the junior officer returned.

1065
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.970
You've talked now.
Yes.

1066
01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.710
The guards loosened the wires and ropes.

1067
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:08.600
Blood rushed back into my veins with knifing pain.
What airplane you fly.

1068
01:09:09.690 --> 01:09:10.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1069
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.920
<v 0>I hesitated a moment at the thought,
well,</v>

1070
01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:18.120
they know the airplane I'm flying because it's so ridiculous to undergo such

1071
01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:22.140
torture for information.
They already have the f four B,

1072
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:37.383
<v 1>that</v>

1073
01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.440
<v 0>part right there.</v>

1074
01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:43.120
I mean where you hesitate for a moment and then you say to yourself,
okay,

1075
01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.340
these guys shot me down in an f four which crashed into this patty and they know

1076
01:09:48.341 --> 01:09:49.840
exactly what I was flying.

1077
01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:56.490
This is not make sense for me to get this kind of abuse and torture for

1078
01:09:57.581 --> 01:09:58.660
something that they already know.

1079
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:06.290
And when you came to that conclusion,
how did you,
did you,

1080
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.140
was it pretty well you're feeling comfortable with it in your mind?

1081
01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:11.060
When you came to collegiate luck,
this is stupid.

1082
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:15.810
<v 2>No,
I was really never comfortable at all in that.
I felt very guilty.</v>

1083
01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.080
I was afraid.
Oh really?

1084
01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:24.081
It was very remorseful that I had not been as strong as I wanted to be.

1085
01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.920
And,
uh,
and through the,
you know,
the first several months of that experience.
So,

1086
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.450
uh,
I felt like,
um,

1087
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:36.930
I felt very guilty about having given up,
you know,

1088
01:10:36.931 --> 01:10:38.950
fighter pilots are not supposed to give up,
you know,

1089
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:43.710
we were by and the code of conduct,
of course,
name,
rank,
serial number,

1090
01:10:43.711 --> 01:10:46.650
date of birth.
Um,
I flew over this,

1091
01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:52.080
the enemy thinking that I was strong enough and that was good enough.
And um,
and,

1092
01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:57.081
and suddenly I was thrust into this situation and I even wondered,

1093
01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:01.320
would I,
would I ever be able to go back to my country?

1094
01:11:01.321 --> 01:11:06.321
Can I face might fellow fighter pilots that were stronger and tougher?

1095
01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:11.790
And
I found out that,
that,

1096
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:15.390
that feeling across the board,
every,

1097
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:19.740
every pow that I ever ran into felt guilty.

1098
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:24.980
And some guys even considered suicide because they felt like they could,

1099
01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:28.890
they could never live with the guilt of having given up.

1100
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.840
And it was,

1101
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:35.900
it was quite a revelation to me when I finally made contact with another

1102
01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:38.840
prisoner and confessed to this guy,

1103
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.650
I remember that my first contact and I said,
I said,

1104
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.500
uh,
oh,
I need to confess something to you.

1105
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:51.390
And when I tell you what I've done,
you may not want to communicate with me.

1106
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:54.420
You may hate me.
And if our roles were reversed,

1107
01:11:54.421 --> 01:11:59.250
I would probably hate you if you did what I did because I assumed that I was the

1108
01:11:59.251 --> 01:12:03.900
only one that ever gave in.
And so he said,
this is Bob Shoemaker.

1109
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:09.360
He said,
what do,
what do you do,
plum?
I said,
well,
I,
I broke.
Uh,

1110
01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.790
I tried to be strong,
but I,
I wasn't,

1111
01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:16.650
I broke in his response and,
and we're,
we're talking on a,

1112
01:12:16.651 --> 01:12:18.060
on the end of a wire,

1113
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:23.061
we tugging on a wire to communicate with each other with this secret code that I

1114
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:28.590
had,
that he had just taught me.
He said,
hell,
everybody broke.

1115
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.131
He said,

1116
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:32.900
there's not a man in this camp that is as strong as he wanted to be said,

1117
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:36.220
so get over yourself,
you know,
and that was a,

1118
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.280
it was a great revelation in my mind,
you know,

1119
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.790
to know that I wasn't the only one that had given him

1120
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.700
<v 0>as you,
you continue this and</v>

1121
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:56.010
again,
I,
you're,
you might've felt like you broke at this point,

1122
01:12:56.011 --> 01:13:00.630
but there's still some unbelievable spirit that you show.

1123
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:05.610
And I'm going back to the book around the courtyard in a nearby room.

1124
01:13:05.611 --> 01:13:08.160
My copilot copilot,
Gary Anderson,

1125
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:12.690
was undergoing about the same treatment as soon as I heard him exploding

1126
01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:16.800
obscenities.
I knew he was near.
Hey Gary,

1127
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:22.170
you all right?
I called the guards are remedial on top,
immediately on top,

1128
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:27.030
kicking and striking.
Gary heard me and yelled back.

1129
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:32.550
It was four years later that I came across a pow who had been a sell close to

1130
01:13:32.551 --> 01:13:35.040
ours at the time.
He said,
boy,

1131
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:38.700
that was one of the craziest things I ever heard you yelling.
Hey Gary,

1132
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:43.140
are you all right?
Bang.
Crunch fid.
Fine.
How about you?

1133
01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:45.030
Smack crash.
Crack.

1134
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:48.623
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1135
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:54.640
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
you eventually get,</v>

1136
01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.210
they're going to take you in and kind of parade you in front of Vietnamese

1137
01:13:58.211 --> 01:14:00.250
people.
And

1138
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.400
going back to the book,
the officer briefed me once more.

1139
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:08.340
I was to walk with my head down until he gave me the command,

1140
01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:11.530
let people see face the guards,
remove the cops,

1141
01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:15.520
and I pumped my hands and torch my shoulders to restore circulation.

1142
01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.620
The guards carefully directed me to the door,

1143
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:20.290
removing the blindfold and warned me not to look around.

1144
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.490
They then prodded me down the hallway lined with photographers and journalists,

1145
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:29.700
a group composed of orientals and a few Caucasians with the officer at my side.

1146
01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:33.910
I walked out of the building onto the patio where a battery of motion cameras

1147
01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:37.060
started worrying.
The officer shouted to me,

1148
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:40.510
let people see face slowly and deliberately.

1149
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:43.150
I looked up staring blankly into space,

1150
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.520
bowed deeply to the cameras and lowered my head.

1151
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.610
I was uneasy about this entire charade,

1152
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:53.200
feeling a combination of resentment and embarrassment at being featured as a

1153
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:54.760
sides show attraction.

1154
01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:01.320
<v 2>And what I didn't know at the time was it was Holcim man's birthday.</v>

1155
01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:06.570
And,
uh,
so that was part of the celebration,
uh,

1156
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:10.680
was I was being presented to the president of their country,

1157
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:14.610
those a birthday gift popping out of a cake.

1158
01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:21.480
And,
uh,
and the good news was that,

1159
01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:25.950
that I was,
I was in the media that they were taking pictures of me.

1160
01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.070
And so after a few months,
uh,

1161
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.670
my family saw those pictures.
Right.
And,
uh,

1162
01:15:32.671 --> 01:15:36.540
and so that was the good news about being shot down on the 19th of May.

1163
01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.210
<v 0>So that was the first indication that people knew that you were actually okay.</v>

1164
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:44.780
Right.
Or You were alive.
Maybe not.
Okay.
A strong word didn't mean to say,
okay,

1165
01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.590
<v 2>we're alive.
The,
uh,
the,
the,</v>

1166
01:15:47.591 --> 01:15:52.591
the picture that was taken and transferred to my family has me with my eyes

1167
01:15:54.081 --> 01:15:56.930
closed in my face was pretty well swollen.

1168
01:15:57.590 --> 01:16:00.140
And my little brother thought that I was dead.

1169
01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.880
He thought that was a picture of a dead man.
And so,
um,
but,

1170
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:09.560
uh,
but I think most people thought,
yeah,
no,
he,
he's alive.
So

1171
01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.460
you actually get,
how'd you get stabbed?

1172
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:19.340
Bayoneted you were about to fall or something?
Actually I was,

1173
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:20.480
I was,
uh,

1174
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:25.370
being prodded to walk faster by these guys.
And I was,

1175
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:29.540
I was hurting at the time,
you know,
I was injured from the,

1176
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:33.110
from the ejection,
and I wasn't able to walk very fast.

1177
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.990
Then I was blindfolded as well.
And so I hit it.

1178
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:41.350
I hit a Rut in the road and these guards with their bayonet fixed behind me stab

1179
01:16:42.441 --> 01:16:46.220
me in the,
in the thigh.
And so that was in fact,

1180
01:16:46.221 --> 01:16:47.870
that was the worst wound that I had.

1181
01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:51.710
And it festered for months because I had no medical care.
Um,

1182
01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:54.570
and um,
but I,

1183
01:16:54.571 --> 01:16:58.970
I never really knew if it was intentional or it was accidental,

1184
01:16:58.971 --> 01:17:01.250
but that was a,
that was how I got that wound.

1185
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.320
<v 0>Now you get back in and they're going to give you,</v>

1186
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:10.350
they give you the rules for the first time that you're supposed to follow and

1187
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:13.980
the,
the guy reads him to your,
and I'm just gonna,

1188
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.230
I gotta read these roles because,
uh,

1189
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:19.130
I think they give a good indication as to what you were facing.

1190
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.420
Here we go back to the book.

1191
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:23.690
You are the blackest criminal that this country has ever seen,

1192
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.680
but do do the lenient humane policy of the Vietnamese people.

1193
01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.520
If you follow regulations,
you live in peace regulation number one,

1194
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:35.750
criminals must give full and complete answers to questions asked by Vietnamese

1195
01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:38.150
guard or officer.
Number two,

1196
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:41.780
criminals must make no noise in room number three.

1197
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:45.590
Criminals must keep room clean and neat and must not mark rooms so graciously

1198
01:17:45.591 --> 01:17:48.290
given by Vietnamese people.
Number four,

1199
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:51.980
criminals must get up and go to bed at sound of Gong.

1200
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.600
Number five,

1201
01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:58.190
criminals must get under bed when imperialist aggressor bomb and strafe our

1202
01:17:58.191 --> 01:17:59.420
sovereign country.

1203
01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:05.030
Number six criminals must say bowel cow when they want.

1204
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:08.690
Ask anything.
Number seven,

1205
01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:13.900
criminals must go only in area that guard orders when they go outside of room.

1206
01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:17.990
Number eight,
criminals must bow to every Vietnamese guards,

1207
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:21.020
officers and people.
Number nine,

1208
01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:24.710
criminals must not bring anything into room from outside.
Number 10,

1209
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:29.950
criminals must not communicate with or look at other criminals in any other room

1210
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:35.450
or outside with minor variations.

1211
01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:38.600
These were the rules for the next six years.

1212
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.350
Big One was the communication.
They didn't want you guys talking to each other.

1213
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:47.030
No,
they didn't.
And uh,

1214
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:51.170
they did all of that they possibly could do to keep us from communicating.

1215
01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:56.150
But we got very clever and we,
uh,
had a lot of ways to communicate.

1216
01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:57.381
Now,

1217
01:18:57.381 --> 01:19:02.381
you spent some time in solitary confinement and here we go back to book.

1218
01:19:03.051 --> 01:19:04.790
During this period of solitary confinement,

1219
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.160
I had much time to think from the start.

1220
01:19:07.161 --> 01:19:11.900
I established a definite schedule for personal reflection and appraisal.

1221
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:15.800
This included a two hour worship service in the morning and a similar one in the

1222
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:18.230
evening.
I spent much time praying,

1223
01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:23.380
talking informally with God and recalling as many scriptures verses and Bible

1224
01:19:24.111 --> 01:19:25.280
stories as I could.

1225
01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:31.960
I also revive the words and tunes to songs from a Tennessee Ernie Ford album

1226
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:35.680
that I'd enjoyed on the Kitty Hawk.
Once in a while,

1227
01:19:35.681 --> 01:19:39.730
I would start humming too loudly and a guard would bang his rifle against the

1228
01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:43.510
door.
I spent more and more time thinking about intangibles.

1229
01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:49.360
The purpose for living ethics,
the supernatural faith,

1230
01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:50.763
pride.

1231
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:56.310
Because the tangibles which I had identified with were no longer present my

1232
01:19:57.611 --> 01:20:01.450
aircraft,
my ship,
my personal possessions.

1233
01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:06.760
This was the onset of a thorough reexamination of my,

1234
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:12.660
<v 2>often these intricate thought processes ended in slumber.</v>

1235
01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:20.300
One of the interesting things that it really most difficult to understand is how

1236
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:25.540
we had nothing going on.
Um,
you know what I mean?
The,
the,

1237
01:20:25.541 --> 01:20:29.640
the average American has hundreds of thousands of inputs,

1238
01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:34.641
everyday colors and sounds and smells and touch and all of these things.

1239
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:37.950
Uh,
and when you're in a little prison cell,

1240
01:20:37.951 --> 01:20:40.620
especially if you're in solitary confinement,
you know,
you might,

1241
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:46.110
you might hear a bird,
you know,
and then that's delightful.
That's a big deal,

1242
01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:50.940
you know,
to hear a bird and nothing else.
So,
uh,

1243
01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:55.860
again,
the good news and the bad news is your mind goes internal and you start,

1244
01:20:55.890 --> 01:21:00.000
you have to,
you have to create things,
uh,
on your own.

1245
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.740
And so you think about these intangible things and you go back through your life

1246
01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:06.750
and,
and,
uh,
and,
and,

1247
01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:11.460
and you think about the things that sustain life and why we are here,

1248
01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.320
because there's nothing else to do.

1249
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:16.200
Did you put some kind of structure around your thoughts?

1250
01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:21.201
It seems like you people might have a tendency just to let their mind wander and

1251
01:21:21.421 --> 01:21:25.440
maybe it wanders into places they don't want it to wander into.
No,

1252
01:21:25.441 --> 01:21:28.440
there was a lot of structure to it.
And uh,
in fact,

1253
01:21:28.441 --> 01:21:32.610
one of the things I did was to go back through my life to the very first memory

1254
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:36.420
that I ever had at three years old in Lee Compton,
Kansas,

1255
01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:41.130
when my grandmother came through and wanted everybody to,
to go with her well.

1256
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.810
And I remember that date.

1257
01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:48.140
And then I went from that to the day that I was shot down and tried to remember

1258
01:21:48.841 --> 01:21:53.370
every book I've ever read,
every friend had ever met,
every girl I'd ever dated,

1259
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:57.600
every a teacher,
books,
movies,
uh,

1260
01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:01.980
experiences.
And it took me about,
as I recall,

1261
01:22:01.981 --> 01:22:05.760
maybe three months working pretty hard on,
on that,

1262
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:11.370
that total autobiography in my mind.
And after that,

1263
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.170
then I would continue to go back through those individual days and try to

1264
01:22:16.171 --> 01:22:17.460
remember something else.
You know,

1265
01:22:17.461 --> 01:22:20.970
a different colored that I'd forgotten or a different person that was in the

1266
01:22:20.971 --> 01:22:22.880
room and whenever I would,

1267
01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.880
when I would discover something that I hadn't discovered the first three months,

1268
01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.180
it was like,
it was like meeting an old friend.

1269
01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:35.210
I could think about that one person or that one book or whatever,

1270
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:40.620
you know,
for an entire day.
And so it was just,
it was a way of,
of,

1271
01:22:40.621 --> 01:22:44.940
um,
of using that time in making the time go by,
uh,

1272
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.070
by working our minds.

1273
01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:51.660
Did you somehow catalog the days in your mind?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
It was a,

1274
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:54.890
it was a chronology.
It was a,
and,

1275
01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:58.920
and most everybody did that and a lot of guys did it much better than I,

1276
01:22:58.921 --> 01:23:03.380
they could tell you,
you know,
what was going on this day,
last year,

1277
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.450
the year before and the year they,
you know,
they,
uh,

1278
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:12.490
they could remember everything and had it all packed away.

1279
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.350
But yes,
it was very well categorized.

1280
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:24.290
<v 0>You finally get some pair of pants,</v>

1281
01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:27.230
a couple pairs of pants,
a couple shirts,
some underwear,

1282
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:32.310
undershirts toothbrush and some soap and you are going to use it for the first

1283
01:23:35.091 --> 01:23:37.850
time I stripped and with my little drinking cup,

1284
01:23:37.851 --> 01:23:42.170
douse myself with water lathered with my new bar of soap and rinsed,

1285
01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:44.690
shedding a two week layer of grime and sweat.

1286
01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:50.360
Then I shaved using a double edged razor which had no handle at last.

1287
01:23:50.361 --> 01:23:54.230
I was clean,
no itchy beard,
no Rican body.

1288
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:58.640
I put on my new clothes and wondered what impressions I would now make on the

1289
01:23:58.641 --> 01:24:03.641
newly captured POW [inaudible] dressed in fresh habla mint.

1290
01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:07.250
I experienced a sublime physical and mental catharsis.

1291
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:11.270
Even the pain of my wounds seem to wash away with the filth.

1292
01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:16.540
15 minutes later I was back in my cell reinspired to outlast any Vietnamese

1293
01:24:17.601 --> 01:24:21.410
endeavor to debase me.
The door opened.

1294
01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.040
I waited for something to happen and then in the doorway sauntered in a tall man

1295
01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.630
back hunched and forehead,
deeply lined.

1296
01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:33.920
He studied me with uncertain eyes and American,

1297
01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.630
another American.

1298
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:39.080
I rushed to the door as quickly as I could and grasped his hand the hand,

1299
01:24:39.081 --> 01:24:43.850
which was completely numb from inadequate sir circulation at the elbows high.

1300
01:24:43.851 --> 01:24:48.410
I said,
Charlie pawn.
So now you're living

1301
01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:51.000
<v 2>dealt with another American.
I am.</v>

1302
01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:55.790
Kay Russell was shut down in the same day I was.
And so he and I were,
uh,

1303
01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.720
he was my first roommate.
Um,
and,
and uh,
you know,
I was,

1304
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:01.900
I was,
uh,

1305
01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.150
in the same cell with a lot of different guys and they moved us around a lot,

1306
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.130
about every six months it moves around,

1307
01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.360
but they would give us different roommates every few months or take them all

1308
01:25:13.361 --> 01:25:16.570
away.
And that was in solitary confinement again.
And uh,

1309
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:18.700
we never really knew why,

1310
01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:24.220
but we assume that it was tried to destroy any fraternization with the guards

1311
01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:29.290
and try to disrupt any unity within the prisoners.

1312
01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:32.000
And so,
um,
so the,

1313
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.640
in fact sometimes there's a little bit difficult to describe exactly what it was

1314
01:25:36.641 --> 01:25:40.270
like because we were in different camps and different cells and you were

1315
01:25:40.330 --> 01:25:43.390
different guys for the entire six years.

1316
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:48.610
But didn't you,
do you like it when you got a new roommate?
Cause it's like a new,

1317
01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:49.930
you kind of explained the,

1318
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.570
it's like now you have a bunch of stuff to talk about what this person

1319
01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.460
absolutely.
Absolutely.
It was a,
it was glorious,
you know,
to find the,
uh,

1320
01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:58.480
because,
you know,

1321
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:02.980
he of course had all of the stories and he had the movies that he could tell you

1322
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:07.100
about and the things that he had learned and,
uh,
that he could teach you.

1323
01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:09.320
So yeah,
no,
it was,
it was wonderful.

1324
01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:13.580
Now that would last for maybe a few months until you ran out of the things and

1325
01:26:13.581 --> 01:26:16.310
then it became almost like a marriage,
you know,
where you've got those,

1326
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:19.940
those periods of time,
money,
mood periods of,
yeah,
exactly.

1327
01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:23.060
Well the fact of matter is you couldn't,
in some of those cells,

1328
01:26:23.061 --> 01:26:27.410
you couldn't be more than eight or 10 feet away from a guy 24,

1329
01:26:27.411 --> 01:26:30.080
seven for months and months and months at a time.
Right.

1330
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:34.640
And so little things start to bug Ya,
you know,
and uh,

1331
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:36.103
Eh,

1332
01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:41.030
not the least of which was a w w was our toilet.

1333
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.460
The toilet was a two gallon bucket in the corner.

1334
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:47.443
And uh,

1335
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:52.660
lots of times it was rusted out at the top with no lid and it was just quite a,

1336
01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.050
you know,
it,
it stunk to high heaven a lot of the cases.

1337
01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:00.840
And um,
and it was quite an irritant.
Yeah.

1338
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
You guys established a routine once you got in there and you know,

1339
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:11.300
there's a whole chapter in the book called routine and you're waking up at six

1340
01:27:11.301 --> 01:27:14.180
30 in the morning,
you're doing prayer at that time,

1341
01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:19.130
you're at seven o'clock,
you're,
you're practicing piano,

1342
01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.420
which I like and right.
And you're practicing piano.
And I was just from memory.

1343
01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:27.050
You,
had you ever played piano before?
I hadn't.
I had not.
Now,

1344
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:32.051
what I did know was that my span from my pinky to my thumb was not,

1345
01:27:32.211 --> 01:27:37.070
it was a,
I could span nine notes on a piano.

1346
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:42.110
And so I laid out a keyboard on my board bed and the new where the black keys

1347
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:46.390
were.
And I had played in the band,
uh,
and uh,

1348
01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:47.690
and also played guitar.

1349
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:50.990
So I knew a little bit about chords and scales and that kind of thing.

1350
01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.620
And I thought,
well,
I've always wanted to play the piano and all,
now's my chance.

1351
01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:58.540
This piece of wood looks good to me.
Yes,
this,
this,
this a work.

1352
01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:02.720
And then at eight o'clock you're doing pushups and sit ups and leg lifts and

1353
01:28:02.721 --> 01:28:04.280
whatever else,
or you're doing some,

1354
01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.910
some physical training and then you have school,

1355
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:11.120
the school bell rings at 9:30 AM and you guys are,

1356
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:14.150
you guys are learning and teaching each other,

1357
01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:17.840
whatever you can possibly teach each other.
Whatever subject you were good at,

1358
01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:22.430
you are going to teach.
We did.
And it was serious stuff.

1359
01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:24.560
As a matter of fact,
when we got home,

1360
01:28:24.561 --> 01:28:28.800
University of Maryland gave us credit for what we had,
you know,
the,
the,

1361
01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:30.470
the courses we had taught,
you know,

1362
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:35.471
without books or paper or powerpoints or instructors or professors or anybody

1363
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:41.050
because we were so intent on using that time for something of value.

1364
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.270
And,
uh,
and,
and,
and these guys,
uh,

1365
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:53.090
most of them smarter than than I would go back through their minds and recapture

1366
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:57.710
all of the subjects that they had learned.
One of the guy,
Joe Milligan,

1367
01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:01.350
I was with him,
uh,
I don't know the first few months,
I guess,

1368
01:29:01.351 --> 01:29:06.150
and he taught a course,
uh,
and um,
uh,

1369
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:09.240
chemistry,
no biology.
It was biology.

1370
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:11.850
And I'd never taken a course in biology.

1371
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:16.230
And I was very interested and in his course lasted about a week.

1372
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:18.900
Um,
and,
and that's all he knew.

1373
01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:24.250
But Joe and I live with him for awhile.
We're laid back on his rack,
about an,
uh,

1374
01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.720
an hour a day and just think about biology.

1375
01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:30.550
And after being there for six years,
he,

1376
01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:35.780
his course lasted six months and he knew everything protozoas the metazoan was.

1377
01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:40.410
And all of this just because that was back there in his mind.

1378
01:29:40.411 --> 01:29:44.730
He was able to recall that.
I recall that in deep,
deep enough.

1379
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:49.650
And it is amazing.
You know what,
what's back in there and your human brain.
It's,

1380
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:51.180
and we found that out.

1381
01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:55.290
If you think about something long enough and hard enough and again you don't

1382
01:29:55.291 --> 01:29:59.640
have these distractions of,
of everyday life that uh,

1383
01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:02.910
there's an awful lot stored back in there.
Yeah.

1384
01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:07.140
I had to bring this one up too because you talked about how you didn't have

1385
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:11.160
PowerPoint or whatever.
You'd have pens and chalkboards and here you go.

1386
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:16.290
Often in my dreams,
I must admit,
I envisioned leaving the Noi,

1387
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:17.520
Hilton going home,

1388
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:22.880
looking for and finding a brand new yellow pencil and bringing it back to myself

1389
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.530
or I would dream of entering shops containing nothing but rows and rows of

1390
01:30:28.531 --> 01:30:29.364
pencils.

1391
01:30:30.210 --> 01:30:33.750
I've never since taking a pencil for granted,

1392
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:38.220
that's,
you know,
we take so much for granted.
I mean,

1393
01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:43.030
didn't take so much for granted and to think about that right there and what,

1394
01:30:43.031 --> 01:30:45.630
what power a pencil.
If you have the power to take notes,

1395
01:30:45.631 --> 01:30:49.830
the power to create the power to draw the power to write this incredible power

1396
01:30:49.831 --> 01:30:53.740
comes from this little thing that we just gaffe off.
Like it's meaningless.

1397
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.790
That's right.
And for you to have that much appreciation for it,

1398
01:30:56.791 --> 01:31:00.690
that you would dream about it at night.
True.

1399
01:31:01.130 --> 01:31:04.380
It's incredible.
Uh,
10 o'clock you'd eat.

1400
01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:09.530
And what was the food?
Was the food you're eating?
Rice balls?
Yeah,
mostly rice.
Uh,

1401
01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:12.420
that was the mainstay.
You had,
um,
you know,

1402
01:31:12.421 --> 01:31:15.390
you get a small bowl of rice twice a day,

1403
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:18.510
looked about 10 o'clock once about two o'clock in the afternoon,

1404
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:22.060
and then you had a 20 hour stretch with nothing to eat.
Uh,

1405
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:25.580
sometimes they'd give you a bowl of broth in.

1406
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:30.590
Sometimes it would be a,
some kind of vegetable turnips or,
uh,

1407
01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:35.100
weeds of some kind when we call sewer soup.

1408
01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:40.560
You couldn't identify this stuff,
but I didn't need it.
You know,

1409
01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:43.520
there was not enough meat,
uh,

1410
01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:47.850
to put in a coffee cup for a year,
you know,
we,
there really was no,

1411
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.130
there was no meat of any variety.
How much,

1412
01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.420
how much did you weigh when you got out?
Uh,
I weighed about 140 when I came home,

1413
01:31:54.421 --> 01:31:56.730
but they fatten this up before we came home.

1414
01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.000
And I figure most of the time I was there about 115 pounds.

1415
01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:06.790
Did you,
uh,
ever was the hunger,

1416
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:07.810
did the hunger go away?

1417
01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:12.010
Did you or you just grinding hunger or did you just get used to it?
Uh,

1418
01:32:12.011 --> 01:32:16.660
it went away for the most part,
you know,
after,
I don't know,
four or five months,

1419
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:19.080
um,
your,

1420
01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:24.230
your stomach sort of shrinks and when you know that there's nothing else to eat,

1421
01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:28.600
um,
and so you know,
that they,

1422
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:33.460
in all fairness,
they gave us enough to keep us alive and,

1423
01:32:33.461 --> 01:32:36.850
um,
uh,
and,
and so that,
you know,

1424
01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:40.210
and rice is a pretty perfect food.
This is unpolished rice.

1425
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:44.580
It wasn't the uncle Ben's and we have today and a,
and there's a lot,
there's,

1426
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:47.830
there's protein in there and there's nutrients in the rice.

1427
01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.980
So that kept me alive.
Yeah.

1428
01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:54.130
At dusk you guys would have

1429
01:32:56.110 --> 01:33:00.250
showtime and people would do what you're talking about describing everything.

1430
01:33:00.251 --> 01:33:03.340
And every movie they've ever seen,
every book they've ever read and all that.

1431
01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:04.451
And uh,

1432
01:33:04.451 --> 01:33:08.680
you mentioned in here that in the beginning of confinement movies that would get

1433
01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:12.160
described or created cause people were creating movies to write in their head.

1434
01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:13.390
Yes,
yes.

1435
01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:18.490
And they went from PG to triple x overtime.

1436
01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:26.450
So did anybody come out and,

1437
01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:29.350
and execute on some of these ideas that they had?

1438
01:33:29.351 --> 01:33:30.730
Is there any way that came out and said,
yeah,

1439
01:33:30.731 --> 01:33:34.600
I thought of this movie or this book?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
In fact,

1440
01:33:34.601 --> 01:33:39.601
Sarah guys had great plans when one guy was a farmer and he had planned a pig

1441
01:33:41.681 --> 01:33:46.630
farm.
That was a,
that was his whole thing.
Um,
and he did,

1442
01:33:46.631 --> 01:33:49.750
he came back in the,
I live with a guy by the name of Danny Glenn,

1443
01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:54.580
who was an architecture student at the University of Oklahoma.

1444
01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:55.870
And,
uh,

1445
01:33:55.870 --> 01:34:00.870
Dan and I were together for a lot of years and he dreamed about building this

1446
01:34:01.271 --> 01:34:03.790
home.
And,
uh,

1447
01:34:03.791 --> 01:34:06.670
and that's all I thought about was building this dream house.

1448
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:11.910
And he had several little things about this home that we're very peculiar.

1449
01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:13.570
One of them was,
uh,

1450
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:18.750
as the sunlight would come through the top of the wall around our prison,

1451
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:24.280
the wall was kept with Barb wire in electrical wire and broken glass.

1452
01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.100
The glass was from bottles.
It was a various colors.

1453
01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.670
And in one particular cell that Dan and I were in,

1454
01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:35.330
the sun would come through the glass,
the colored glass,
and on to,
uh,

1455
01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.840
this,
this,
this tank of water,

1456
01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.320
and then reflect up under the eaves of our fast roof and into ourselves.

1457
01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:48.160
So we had all these colors and it was a beautiful thing,
you know,

1458
01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:53.060
was a kaleidoscope of colors.
And so he designed a house,
any figure,

1459
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:54.430
this whole thing out,
you know,
with the,

1460
01:34:54.850 --> 01:34:58.700
with the asthma of the sun and in all of this stuff and how he was going to do

1461
01:34:58.701 --> 01:35:00.880
this.
But,
uh,

1462
01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:05.960
and he would lay this out and he would draw on the concrete floor with a piece

1463
01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:10.080
of brick.
And,
uh,
he was a great artist,
you know,
the,

1464
01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:14.390
the guy could,
could design all this stuff.
And,
uh,

1465
01:35:14.410 --> 01:35:15.650
and of course,
you know,

1466
01:35:15.651 --> 01:35:20.651
he wanted me to be involved in this and in bore me to tears.

1467
01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:24.290
And he's Charlie.
What color do you think my bathroom ought to be?

1468
01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:30.050
I Dunno man.
I don't know.
No,
no,
no.
Charlie green or blue?
I don't know.

1469
01:35:30.051 --> 01:35:34.330
Green and green.
Okay.
So we,
we get home in,

1470
01:35:34.331 --> 01:35:36.020
had about a year after we,

1471
01:35:36.021 --> 01:35:40.840
I was living in Kansas and that he was in Oklahoma and he called me up.
Charlie,

1472
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:42.440
I got something to show you.

1473
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.740
And so I had a little airplane at the time when I flew down to Norman,

1474
01:35:45.741 --> 01:35:49.910
Oklahoma and he picked me up at the airport and we drove outside of town from

1475
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:53.990
about a quarter of a mile away.
I saw this house that I recognize,

1476
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:57.400
but I'd never been in Norman,
Oklahoma and I,

1477
01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:00.170
I swear I could have walked in that house and,

1478
01:36:00.250 --> 01:36:03.750
and touched any faucet or any light switch,
you know,

1479
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:06.890
the whole points because it was exactly as he had decided the prison.

1480
01:36:07.810 --> 01:36:10.850
So I went to the bathroom and it was blue.

1481
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:14.650
He had gone back,
you know,

1482
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:19.660
he had built it from a building materials that he had remembered and over the

1483
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.260
years that we were there they changed and so there were some of the,

1484
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:30.370
it was not available and so he went to these old lumber yards and he would find

1485
01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:35.150
the building materials that he had planned this house with and use those to

1486
01:36:35.151 --> 01:36:38.810
build his house.
And it was Greg.
But yeah,
a lot of the guys,

1487
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:41.930
a lot of the guys wanted to sail around the world.

1488
01:36:41.931 --> 01:36:44.240
You know a lot of us navy guys,
we had a sale and,

1489
01:36:44.250 --> 01:36:48.770
and that was the big fantasy was to take a sailing trip around the world in two

1490
01:36:48.771 --> 01:36:50.870
or three of the guys actually did that when they came home.

1491
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:53.353
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1492
01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:56.290
<v 0>Awesome.
The guards,</v>

1493
01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.870
some of the guards were pretty sadistic and here we go back to the,

1494
01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:05.980
probably the most sadistic practice of all was a game involving mice or puppies.

1495
01:37:05.981 --> 01:37:09.670
Guards would douse them with gasoline and set them on fire and turn them loose

1496
01:37:09.671 --> 01:37:12.790
to squeal and scurry and search a relief from the heat.

1497
01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:16.480
Then the soldiers would chase them with sticks playing polo with their live

1498
01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:20.350
fireballs until the little animals blackened and died.

1499
01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:25.680
So you had some serious sad status.
Yeah,

1500
01:37:25.681 --> 01:37:30.681
we just do an evil things and you say you didn't see anything book magazine,

1501
01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:36.840
newspaper Lyrics or song written speech,

1502
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:39.030
any billboard or anything while you were there.

1503
01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:40.650
That wasn't just a hundred percent propaganda.

1504
01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:43.120
<v 2>That's true.
You know,
uh,</v>

1505
01:37:43.121 --> 01:37:47.350
their music doesn't talk about love except for love of hace man and love of

1506
01:37:47.351 --> 01:37:51.150
their country and dedication to that,
um,
at,

1507
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:55.980
it's really incredible how they just fill the minds of their people with this

1508
01:37:55.981 --> 01:37:58.350
propaganda.
And uh,
you know,

1509
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:02.180
you tell somebody long enough and loud enough and they believe it and that's,

1510
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:03.300
you know,
that was the whole,

1511
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:04.400
<v 3>that was the whole country.</v>

1512
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:09.790
The one point you got this propaganda newspaper and it's the front page headline

1513
01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:15.800
was that there's been a revolution in rice planting technique and you were

1514
01:38:15.801 --> 01:38:16.760
thinking yourself,
oh man,

1515
01:38:16.761 --> 01:38:20.120
they must have invented some big machine that can like plan all the rice and now

1516
01:38:20.121 --> 01:38:21.630
they don't have to be out there on that.

1517
01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:24.680
You're doing the manual labor in the fields.
And here's the actual article.

1518
01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:27.950
For 4,000 years,
the Vietnamese people had been laboring,
sweating,

1519
01:38:27.951 --> 01:38:30.080
and toiling in the modern water of rice patties.

1520
01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:33.560
We've discovered a revolutionary method of planting rice.

1521
01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:35.570
Through extensive research.

1522
01:38:35.571 --> 01:38:40.571
We have found that instead of grasping the rice sprouts and planting them with

1523
01:38:40.611 --> 01:38:44.540
the palm of the hand facing downward is much more efficient to plant the rice

1524
01:38:44.541 --> 01:38:47.510
sprouts with the palm of the hand facing upward.

1525
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:51.163
So there's,

1526
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:55.250
there's the propaganda coming at you and there's the advancement of the,

1527
01:38:55.251 --> 01:38:58.670
you know,
them trying to tell the people how we're moving forward in the world.

1528
01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:05.060
And that was another thing that surprised me or it didn't surprise me,

1529
01:39:05.061 --> 01:39:08.030
but how,
what their,
their understanding,
you know,
they're,

1530
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:11.270
they're brainwashed and their understanding of what American culture was like.

1531
01:39:11.271 --> 01:39:14.930
And when you'd say,
well,
yeah,
I have a car and I have an air conditioner.

1532
01:39:14.931 --> 01:39:18.320
To them that was just unbelievable because the only people that could afford

1533
01:39:18.321 --> 01:39:21.500
that in Vietnam war,
this was the state itself.

1534
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:25.460
<v 2>True.
And they assume that if he had a car,
uh,</v>

1535
01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:28.550
you could carry pigs or chickens or something in your car.

1536
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:31.610
I guess that was the whole purpose of any kind of transportation was a haul

1537
01:39:31.611 --> 01:39:34.670
something around.
And,
uh,
and they,
you know,

1538
01:39:34.671 --> 01:39:36.220
they were really surprised that you could actually

1539
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:38.720
<v 3>just get in the car and go wherever you want it to go.</v>

1540
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:43.940
And they also fought that a third of Americans were starving to death.

1541
01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:48.920
So that's,
you know,
something to think about.

1542
01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:53.560
Always when you deal with these countries where people are being indoctrinated

1543
01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:57.920
and be with,
they're being fed information from the state,
it's going to be,

1544
01:39:58.550 --> 01:40:01.390
it's going to be lower eyes and you,
you,
you,

1545
01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.530
you can't be surprised when they believe something like that.

1546
01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:06.320
You just have to say what they believe.
How do we reeducate them?

1547
01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:11.560
<v 2>I went back to Vietnam,
uh,
first time in 43 years.
I hadn't been back.</v>

1548
01:40:12.130 --> 01:40:15.370
And,
uh,
a lot of things had changed,
you know,
I mean,

1549
01:40:15.371 --> 01:40:19.300
they still call themselves a communist country,
but oh,
by the way,

1550
01:40:19.301 --> 01:40:20.830
capitalism is alive and well,

1551
01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:26.010
but the propaganda is still exists there.
And,
uh,

1552
01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:31.120
and I took my family with me,
uh,
my wife and three of our four kids.

1553
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:35.530
Uh,
and in the 11 days that I was there,

1554
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:40.510
I never met anyone.
And I was at,
you know,
it was to embassy.

1555
01:40:40.511 --> 01:40:42.940
I spoke to the students at the university.

1556
01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:47.840
I spoke to cab drivers and waitresses and anybody.
And they,

1557
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:50.740
it really,
really nice people and very,
very nice to me.

1558
01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:56.130
But nobody knew that Americans had been tortured in the Vietnam War.

1559
01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.690
And in fact,
it was just the opposite.

1560
01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:03.990
They all would tell you that we got better treatment than the soldiers did and

1561
01:41:05.291 --> 01:41:10.210
better medical care than the soldiers did.
And so,
and in fact,

1562
01:41:10.211 --> 01:41:13.990
and in one of the,
uh,
one of the last days I was there,

1563
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:19.080
I ran into a lady in the park selling card postcards and she was missing a one

1564
01:41:21.131 --> 01:41:26.110
leg and she was about my age.
And so I sort of piece this thing together and,

1565
01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:30.580
uh,
she said,
one of my postcard,
well,
I'll buy a postcard,

1566
01:41:30.581 --> 01:41:34.020
but I want to hear your story.
Sit Down on this park bench and then,
uh,

1567
01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:38.770
tell me your story.
And she did.
I said,
how'd you lose your leg?
She said,

1568
01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:44.250
linebacker to linebacker to was the codename for the [inaudible] bombings that

1569
01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:50.040
ended the war in night in the Christmas of 1972 at,

1570
01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:52.600
but it was a secret code knee,
you know,

1571
01:41:52.601 --> 01:41:57.601
and for her to say she didn't call it an air raid or a bomb or anything else,

1572
01:41:58.261 --> 01:42:00.790
just call called our linebacker to,
and it was aren't,
you know,

1573
01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:05.560
that was our pilot jargon,
not her jargon.
And uh,

1574
01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:09.370
I said,
uh,
w what,
what,
what was the date?
She said 24,

1575
01:42:09.371 --> 01:42:12.910
December,
1972.
So I knew that she wasn't lying to me.

1576
01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:18.100
She said,
um,
be 52.
Oh yeah.

1577
01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:19.360
Well,

1578
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:24.360
so we talked for maybe 30 minutes on that park bench and she spoke very good

1579
01:42:25.061 --> 01:42:28.930
English.
And,
uh,
and at one point I said to her,

1580
01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:33.670
you speak excellent English.
You could be an interpreter,
you can be a guide.

1581
01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:37.690
Why are you out here making a living selling postcards in a park?

1582
01:42:38.530 --> 01:42:40.440
She said,
oh my,

1583
01:42:40.690 --> 01:42:45.130
my country would never give me a permit because I'm an invalid.

1584
01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:50.980
Ah,
man,
what a country.
And,
and then I said,
well,
um,

1585
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:56.470
uh,
do you know about the,
uh,
the museums?
Uh,
oh yeah.

1586
01:42:56.471 --> 01:42:59.650
I know all about the museums and the Hanoi Hilton Museum.
See,

1587
01:42:59.651 --> 01:43:02.290
they've made a museum out of my old prison camp.

1588
01:43:02.291 --> 01:43:06.040
The Hanoi Hilton is now a museum.
And I said,
well,

1589
01:43:06.041 --> 01:43:10.330
how were the prisoners treated at the museum?
All of they were treated great.

1590
01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.460
They had great food.
They played volleyball,
they had ping pong.
I said,

1591
01:43:15.461 --> 01:43:19.300
how do you know this?
She said,
oh,
documentaries.

1592
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:21.550
The government shows us documentaries.

1593
01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.500
And so she finally figured out that I was about her age and she said,

1594
01:43:26.501 --> 01:43:30.940
were you a pilot?
I said,
yeah,
it was a pilot.
She said,

1595
01:43:30.941 --> 01:43:35.230
be 52.
I said,
no.
I flew f four phantoms.
Oh,

1596
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:38.440
so were were you flying?
Uh,

1597
01:43:38.441 --> 01:43:42.820
on the 24th of December of 1972 I said,
no,

1598
01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.950
I was right here with you.
I was in the Hanoi Hilton and I was being tortured.

1599
01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:52.730
She said,
no,
that's impossible.
That it can't possibly be true.

1600
01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:56.270
I could not convince this lady that I would,

1601
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:58.710
that I or anybody else there.

1602
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.970
So the propaganda is alive and well.

1603
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:06.200
They keep continue to tell that people the lies and uh,
and,

1604
01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:08.120
and the folks who have no way of figuring it out,

1605
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:13.170
<v 3>you know,
it's,
uh,
uh,
another thing that,</v>

1606
01:44:13.190 --> 01:44:17.260
that you point out in the book on that culture or that,

1607
01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.520
that system of government back to the book,

1608
01:44:19.521 --> 01:44:22.490
the Vietnamese rarely exerted themselves.
Why should they,

1609
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:24.680
if they were gonna get a meal at all,

1610
01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:28.310
they'd eat regardless of whether they worked for it or not.
They didn't worry.

1611
01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.120
They didn't have to,

1612
01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:32.180
the state was responsible for their welfare as well as their guidance.

1613
01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.720
Even the upkeep of state property was not their problem.
So

1614
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:39.080
they're scary thing when

1615
01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:43.110
<v 2>it really is,
when,
you know,</v>

1616
01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:46.620
when folks are indoctrinated to that level and,
um,

1617
01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.880
but it's so prevalent,
you know,
uh,
and,

1618
01:44:49.881 --> 01:44:51.780
and they tried to do the same thing with us.
Yeah.

1619
01:44:51.930 --> 01:44:54.450
They tried to brainwash shots in,
it

1620
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:57.280
<v 3>was more important to,
you were kind of worried about that too in the beginning,</v>

1621
01:44:57.281 --> 01:44:58.120
right?
Like you fall,

1622
01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:01.450
it was something you needed to be concerned about and then you saw how

1623
01:45:01.451 --> 01:45:02.290
ridiculous.

1624
01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:07.630
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know,
they,
they,
uh,
they used a lot of,</v>

1625
01:45:07.631 --> 01:45:10.180
of the Russian,
the military equipment,

1626
01:45:10.181 --> 01:45:14.500
but they never invited the Russians in to try to brainwash us.
And we felt very,

1627
01:45:14.501 --> 01:45:19.450
very happy about that because they're brainwashing techniques were so silly.
And,

1628
01:45:19.451 --> 01:45:23.860
uh,
you know,
they would tell us this unbelievable things that,
that we laughed at

1629
01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.480
where you thought the Russians would do a better job.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

1630
01:45:28.481 --> 01:45:29.320
I'm sure they would have,

1631
01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:32.920
but more important than the rice we ate or the water we drink.

1632
01:45:32.921 --> 01:45:37.270
And every prison cell I was in,
the first thing they put in there was a speaker.

1633
01:45:38.050 --> 01:45:39.700
And,
um,
you know,
lots of,

1634
01:45:39.701 --> 01:45:42.070
lots of the prison camps didn't have any electricity at all,

1635
01:45:42.071 --> 01:45:46.360
but they had speakers and they were well above our reach,

1636
01:45:46.361 --> 01:45:50.410
so we couldn't turn them off or adjust the volume.
And,
um,

1637
01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:55.800
several times a day they would come on with the propaganda and telling us how

1638
01:45:57.101 --> 01:46:02.020
bad we were and how terrible our country was and how wonderful they were.
And um,

1639
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:07.000
in it,
it was pretty easy to turn these guys off,
you know,

1640
01:46:07.001 --> 01:46:11.440
just to ignore the uh,
the broadcast.

1641
01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:16.690
But it was also very concerning to see that that's the way they way they

1642
01:46:16.691 --> 01:46:17.800
indoctrinate their own people.

1643
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.660
<v 3>Horrible.
You,</v>

1644
01:46:20.661 --> 01:46:25.661
you talked about a little bit earlier you talked about the communication and,

1645
01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:29.240
and what that was all about and you had this lift the first time you were in

1646
01:46:29.241 --> 01:46:30.074
your cell,

1647
01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:35.860
you hear a little scraping and eventually you go over and it's little wire and

1648
01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:39.220
eventually note comes through it.
And here we go back to the book,

1649
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:43.850
had a piece of toilet paper tied to it.
I unfolded it and found these words,

1650
01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:48.350
memorize code,
eat note.
The code was easier to memorize.

1651
01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.980
Then the note was to eat.
But

1652
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.170
<v 2>I did both.
I rechecked the door,</v>

1653
01:46:52.230 --> 01:46:55.140
sat back down on the honey bucket and talked on the wire.

1654
01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.610
The code was a series of togs which represented letters of the alphabet and
it's,

1655
01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:03.150
it's basically a five by five code a,
B,
c,
d,
g,
e,
f,
g.

1656
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:06.150
And that is how you guys communicated.

1657
01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.850
And that had to be,

1658
01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:12.600
how long does it take to have a conversation with that code?
Cause you give,

1659
01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:17.670
you know,
one,
two tugs to go down and then one,
two,
three tugs to go across.

1660
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.550
How long does it take when you have these conversations?

1661
01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:23.100
Must have taken a long time.
Well that's true.

1662
01:47:23.101 --> 01:47:26.070
But that was a beauty of it because that's all we had was time.

1663
01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:31.440
And that was a very good way of,
uh,
of whiling away.
The hours is tugging on,

1664
01:47:31.441 --> 01:47:34.580
the wires are tapping on walls and uh,
or,

1665
01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.940
or sneezing and wheezing.

1666
01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.990
We had all kinds of ways to communicate and uh,
Eh,

1667
01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:46.690
and we took great pride in our communication effort and the sneezing and reasons

1668
01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:51.000
that just was it more,
how did the sneezing and wheezing,
coughing,

1669
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:53.090
it was the same kind of thing,
you know?
Uh,

1670
01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.610
it was all based around this five by five Matrix of the alphabet.

1671
01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.880
And so a cough would,
wouldn't be one.

1672
01:47:59.881 --> 01:48:04.720
A sneeze would be to weeds would be three on and so forth.
So that,

1673
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:09.360
so that two sounds would equal a letter.

1674
01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:12.090
And we use this in a lot of different ways.

1675
01:48:12.091 --> 01:48:15.870
If a guy was outside chopping wood for a fire for instance,

1676
01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:20.880
and he would chop in this code,
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop,

1677
01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:25.150
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop,
chop.
And it was what we called it,

1678
01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:29.910
we called it in a radio station because everybody could hear it.
And uh,

1679
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:33.290
and so,
um,
if,

1680
01:48:33.291 --> 01:48:38.230
if a new guy came into the camp and we knew who the president was,
you know,

1681
01:48:38.250 --> 01:48:41.960
lots of,
we did,
we had no information at all or new,
uh,

1682
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:46.140
who won the world series for instance,
why it was really big deal,
you know,

1683
01:48:46.141 --> 01:48:50.850
to get out there and chop the wood and the radio station and until the entire

1684
01:48:50.851 --> 01:48:54.980
camp,
who was the president?
The,

1685
01:48:55.410 --> 01:49:00.000
the guards ever catch on to that five by five code.
Yes.
Uh,

1686
01:49:00.001 --> 01:49:04.260
occasionally in a couple of guys were tortured to,
to reveal the code,

1687
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:06.000
but they could,
but they were,

1688
01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:11.360
it was really interesting because they were so uncoordinated that they couldn't

1689
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.840
replicate the code and they,
on several cases,

1690
01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:20.220
they tried to trick us and they would empty out a sale.
And they would,
uh,

1691
01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:25.250
go into that cell and try to tap on the wall or tug on the wire in the code.

1692
01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:30.790
And we knew immediately,
you know,
that it wasn't an American.
Uh,

1693
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:34.650
and you guys would get,
like I said is interesting.
You count you,

1694
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.380
you laid out two things.

1695
01:49:36.381 --> 01:49:40.680
At first the Vietnamese were like pretty much okay with stealing and so you

1696
01:49:40.681 --> 01:49:42.690
wouldn't get punished for stealing that bad.

1697
01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.390
But the communication thing is what they is what they would definitely punish

1698
01:49:45.391 --> 01:49:48.720
you for.
Yup.
True.
Yeah.
That,

1699
01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:52.870
<v 3>uh,
I mean that's the same thing.
I mean,
when we capture prisoners overseas,</v>

1700
01:49:52.871 --> 01:49:54.070
we don't want to talk to each other.

1701
01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:57.190
We'd separate them and you don't want them to talk to each other.

1702
01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:02.380
And at some point you started getting letters and receiving letters.

1703
01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:05.140
And how did that change the environment?

1704
01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:11.540
<v 2>Well,
I'm in a,
first of all,
we were just overjoyed to see that our,</v>

1705
01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:16.640
that our families,
you know,
that my wife,
uh,
was,
was okay and um,

1706
01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:22.260
and that they knew that we were alive.
And so it was,
you know,

1707
01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:26.080
it was a wonderful connection that we made.
Now we,

1708
01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:27.800
we call them letters,

1709
01:50:27.801 --> 01:50:32.720
but actually they were postcards and I'm in,

1710
01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.860
they were highly edited.
Uh,

1711
01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:39.560
it began with a postcard is we're just blanked out.

1712
01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:42.710
And then the Vietnamese decided that that's not good enough.

1713
01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:47.980
They actually would cut out certain words and so he had a postcard of six lines

1714
01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.230
and maybe of the six lines,

1715
01:50:51.231 --> 01:50:53.960
there might be a 15 words,

1716
01:50:53.961 --> 01:50:58.790
they would just cut out with a pair of scissors so that sometimes you really

1717
01:50:58.791 --> 01:51:02.300
couldn't figure it out what they were trying to say.
But you know,

1718
01:51:02.301 --> 01:51:06.890
that the fact that,
uh,
that was in the handwriting of a loved one,

1719
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:10.640
uh,
was,
was,
was,
was very comforting.

1720
01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.580
And yet those bastards,

1721
01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:18.470
and I use that term very specifically for this situation,
the dear John Letters,

1722
01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:22.610
they'd leave.
Those components are good to go and turn those over.
And you know,

1723
01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:26.660
it's,
you say bastards for that.
Is that kind of behavior from bastards?

1724
01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:29.780
Yeah.
They were quick to,
uh,

1725
01:51:29.781 --> 01:51:33.560
to tell us that our wives had filed for divorce or that,
uh,
you know,

1726
01:51:33.650 --> 01:51:38.510
our parents had died or that any bad news.
Uh,
they were,

1727
01:51:38.630 --> 01:51:39.980
they were very quick to promote.

1728
01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:46.310
<v 3>Yeah.
The chain of command that you guys,</v>

1729
01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:50.040
you know,
here you are in this prison camp and you guys all,
you know,

1730
01:51:50.050 --> 01:51:50.930
you figured out,

1731
01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:54.110
you realize we need to have a chain of command and you put that structure into

1732
01:51:54.111 --> 01:51:56.060
place.
And

1733
01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:02.510
when you did that,
did that Kinda,
I mean,
it seems like it would have,

1734
01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:06.130
it seems like that gave you guys so much strength as an,

1735
01:52:06.230 --> 01:52:10.670
as a group to get in the chain of command,
to organize yourselves.

1736
01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.740
It seemed like that gave you guys so much strength and fortitude as you,

1737
01:52:15.741 --> 01:52:16.850
as you were there.

1738
01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:22.290
<v 2>It was absolutely our survival,
uh,
was our chain of command.</v>

1739
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:25.440
Um,
what,
what you don't know.

1740
01:52:25.441 --> 01:52:28.620
And reading my book because they're only happened two or three years ago.

1741
01:52:28.621 --> 01:52:31.920
A study was done of all of the combatants of Vietnam,

1742
01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:34.980
of all the million and a half people that were exposed to that war,

1743
01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:37.500
30.6% had PTSD.

1744
01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:41.400
Almost a third of the combatants in Vietnam,

1745
01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:43.890
post traumatic stress disorder of the prisoners of war.

1746
01:52:44.130 --> 01:52:46.880
4% of us that PTSD,

1747
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:52.190
and it's primarily the guys who were shot down near the end of the war were only

1748
01:52:52.191 --> 01:52:54.860
prisoners for a few weeks or a month or two.

1749
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:57.740
And what we really believe,

1750
01:52:57.741 --> 01:53:02.450
and this is spelled out in another book called lessons from the Hanoi Hilton,

1751
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:05.420
which was written about,
uh,
two years ago,

1752
01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:11.120
lessons from the Hanoi Hilton explains that the reason why we came back and her

1753
01:53:11.121 --> 01:53:16.121
in such great shape is because of the unit to the we had in the leadership that

1754
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:22.961
we had in the prison camps because of the 591 guys came home and of the 591 and

1755
01:53:24.801 --> 01:53:27.170
they thought we'd be in baskets.
They thought we'd be vegetables.

1756
01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:32.000
They had our families brief to institutionalize us for the rest of our lives.

1757
01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:34.070
That's what they thought was coming home from prison camp.

1758
01:53:34.071 --> 01:53:37.250
And what can you expect from 591 guys?

1759
01:53:37.251 --> 01:53:40.760
We've produced 17 generals,
seven admirals.

1760
01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:43.910
Most of us retired his senior grade military officers.

1761
01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:48.380
We have doctors and lawyers and preachers and teachers and bishops and judges

1762
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:51.800
where a bunch of congressmen,
two United States senators,

1763
01:53:52.190 --> 01:53:55.730
two ambassadors.
We have a vice presidential candidate,

1764
01:53:55.731 --> 01:53:59.090
a president or candidate,
my old flight instructor,
John Mccain.

1765
01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:04.670
And they're telling us today where it healthier mentally and physically then if

1766
01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:06.020
we hadn't been shot down.

1767
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:10.430
And it was primarily because of the leadership,

1768
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:12.970
the chain of command that we had over there,

1769
01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:17.980
the unity that we found and the purpose that that's what the leadership in the

1770
01:54:18.261 --> 01:54:21.050
prison camp did for us.
Uh,

1771
01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:25.730
Jim Stockdale was our senior SRO,

1772
01:54:25.731 --> 01:54:29.750
senior residing officer in a prison camp for a long time and he said,

1773
01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:34.640
we are no longer victims of circumstance beyond our control.

1774
01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:39.230
We are not on the defensive here.
We are military men,

1775
01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:43.520
we are combatants and we will pursue this war until our last breath.

1776
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:45.370
And so what he did,

1777
01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:49.490
what that did was it gave us a reason to live,

1778
01:54:49.491 --> 01:54:53.170
a reason to be a reason to unify.
And the,
the,

1779
01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:58.010
the way we fought the war from the prison camp was to try to deny them any

1780
01:54:58.011 --> 01:55:02.150
propaganda.
Because as you,
as you've already said,
Jocko,
that this,

1781
01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:05.600
the propaganda was the mainstay.
I mean,
it was,

1782
01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:10.030
that was numero uno in their world was,

1783
01:55:10.110 --> 01:55:14.690
was propagandizing.
And they felt that,
that they,

1784
01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:19.800
that they could use us to tell the rest of the world how wonderful communism was

1785
01:55:20.241 --> 01:55:23.690
and how terrible capitalism was.
And now they were right,
we were wrong.

1786
01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:25.970
And so they would,
they would,
uh,

1787
01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:30.980
force guys to make tapes or write letters to the antiwar element and,

1788
01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:36.380
you know,
proclaim the,
the,
the wonderful nature of communism.

1789
01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:41.810
And so our job was to defend against this.
And,
uh,

1790
01:55:41.811 --> 01:55:44.040
and so we set up all

1791
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:44.860
<v 3>kinds of,</v>

1792
01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:49.860
of methods so that we would deny them any propaganda or even in some cases,

1793
01:55:52.141 --> 01:55:55.530
we would even go farther than to not deny.
The propaganda,

1794
01:55:55.531 --> 01:56:00.240
we would use their tools against them and that we would tell the world that,
oh,

1795
01:56:00.241 --> 01:56:03.840
by the way,
we are being tortured and oh by the way,
you know this,
you know,

1796
01:56:03.841 --> 01:56:08.340
these guys are attacking our neighbor in south Vietnam.
And so,

1797
01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:13.500
so the,
so that was the big effort and,
and um,
you know,
like I said,

1798
01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:14.510
this whole thing,

1799
01:56:14.511 --> 01:56:19.511
you just can't came out a few years ago that this was the big reason that we did

1800
01:56:21.121 --> 01:56:26.121
so well and that we're so healthy mentally and physically to today was because

1801
01:56:27.241 --> 01:56:31.020
we had this chain of command.
And on top of that,

1802
01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:32.490
and this is what I've really,

1803
01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:36.120
one of the big points I wanted to talk about today was what you're just hitting

1804
01:56:36.121 --> 01:56:40.230
on is that people have this idea that the military chain of command is this

1805
01:56:40.231 --> 01:56:44.120
rigid structure and that's why it survives.
And that's what the,

1806
01:56:44.230 --> 01:56:48.960
but you guys were put into a position that it was,
yes,

1807
01:56:48.961 --> 01:56:51.120
there's a military chain of command just like I had in the seal teams.

1808
01:56:51.121 --> 01:56:51.630
And if you,

1809
01:56:51.630 --> 01:56:54.600
if you think in the seal teams that I was the guy that was in charge and I was

1810
01:56:54.601 --> 01:56:57.330
barking orders and everyone was following everything I said to.
It's like,
no,

1811
01:56:57.331 --> 01:57:01.860
it wasn't like that.
It's a much more collaborative deal and you,

1812
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:06.330
you and this really became clear one section of the book here.
I'm going to,

1813
01:57:06.331 --> 01:57:07.650
I'm going to,
I'm going to read that.

1814
01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:13.080
What you were dealing with and how challenging this leadership position was for

1815
01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:16.350
the people that were,
we're leading,
so here we going back to the book,

1816
01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.150
making sure that everyone was on our team was the first of many objectives.

1817
01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:24.210
Understanding the rules of the game was the second.

1818
01:57:24.630 --> 01:57:28.140
It was assumed that all of us had a basic knowledge of the military discipline

1819
01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.020
and the code of conduct.
This code,

1820
01:57:31.021 --> 01:57:35.130
a very general document was open to many interpretations.

1821
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:39.570
How we construed the code often depending on the severity of the situation,

1822
01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:44.070
no longer could we pick up a telephone and call the Pentagon for advice.

1823
01:57:45.150 --> 01:57:49.650
The broad spectrum of the code divided the men in at least two groups.

1824
01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:55.050
Those who were disciplinarians by nature and interpreted the code strictly and

1825
01:57:55.051 --> 01:57:58.470
those who were liberal and rendered the code loosely.

1826
01:57:58.770 --> 01:58:03.530
We called these two groups,
the tough guys and the softies,
but this is this.

1827
01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:07.320
The key part right here,
softy was not derogatory.

1828
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:11.160
The name simply indicated a different approach to the code.

1829
01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:15.960
Tough guys who referred to the line,
I will never surrender of my own freewill.

1830
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:19.740
Sometimes flaunted their encourage ability and taunted the guards.

1831
01:58:20.250 --> 01:58:23.700
The Vietnamese answered with torture and the tough guys occasionally

1832
01:58:23.701 --> 01:58:28.230
relinquished more information than the softies who never committed themselves.

1833
01:58:29.010 --> 01:58:32.400
Regardless of our attitudes,
we were all in the same boat.

1834
01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:36.990
Each of us had acquiesce to the Vietnamese control to some extent,

1835
01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:39.540
whether accepting cigarettes are bowing to guards.

1836
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:44.500
The line which separated the tough guys from the softies was often unclear.

1837
01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:48.400
The important thing was to display unity.

1838
01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:52.180
Regardless of our individual philosophies,

1839
01:58:52.450 --> 01:58:56.830
we clearly understood that the Vietnamese would capitalize on any chinks they

1840
01:58:56.831 --> 01:59:00.760
found in our armor.
Unity didn't evolve automatically.

1841
01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:05.590
Learning its value required from us,
such introspection and sacrifice.

1842
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:11.160
How could it camp SRO appease the softies if he interpreted the code to strictly

1843
01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.070
or if he was too lax for the tough guys,

1844
01:59:15.670 --> 01:59:20.410
he was in an untenable position having little control over the actions of men in

1845
01:59:20.411 --> 01:59:24.190
other rooms.
He had excessive responsibility,

1846
01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:29.120
but none of the tools of authority.
No reduction of salary,

1847
01:59:29.121 --> 01:59:33.520
suspension of Liberty Court Marshal.
Indeed most of the fellows,

1848
01:59:33.521 --> 01:59:38.521
he had never seen his only association being a tap on the wall or a scribbled

1849
01:59:39.101 --> 01:59:42.280
message to meet this impractical setting.

1850
01:59:42.281 --> 01:59:45.490
The SRO wielded gentle sticks of diplomacy.

1851
01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:51.250
They knew we were not boots,
meaning bootcamp guys fresh out of bootcamp.
Who?
Who,

1852
01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:54.340
who asked how high at the command,
the jump.

1853
01:59:54.850 --> 01:59:59.770
We were all trained leaders who acted independently for the first few years.

1854
01:59:59.771 --> 02:00:03.490
The SRO is a 40 was limited to advice rather than orders.

1855
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:09.030
Realizing the importance of unity we respected is this advice as the wit were in

1856
02:00:09.761 --> 02:00:10.594
order.

1857
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:14.230
What if we refuse an order on the basis that it did not come from the commander,

1858
02:00:14.231 --> 02:00:17.860
but rather from five men who interpreted through our error ridden system.

1859
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:21.880
What if compliance to the order brought certain torture?

1860
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:25.360
We were very alone in answering these questions.

1861
02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:28.480
Once I received an order plumb request,

1862
02:00:28.481 --> 02:00:31.750
you communicate with Captain Abbot at all costs.

1863
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:35.290
What did the SRO mean by at all costs?

1864
02:00:35.770 --> 02:00:39.100
They didn't include being caught and put in leg irons for months at a time.

1865
02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:44.590
So the way that that is laid out,

1866
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:48.520
it reflects not just leadership in a prison camp.

1867
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:51.940
I'm here to tell you it reflects leadership in every situation because the

1868
02:00:51.941 --> 02:00:55.630
minute that you as a leader decided that you're just going to impose your will

1869
02:00:55.631 --> 02:00:59.680
on other people is where you start to lose respect and people start questioning

1870
02:00:59.681 --> 02:01:01.810
what you're doing.
That's very true.

1871
02:01:02.590 --> 02:01:05.020
And I think that the way that this comes out,

1872
02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:07.710
and that probably is one of the reasons why,
you know,

1873
02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:12.580
I didn't know about the facts that you just told me about the only 4% having

1874
02:01:12.581 --> 02:01:14.100
PTSD.
I mean,

1875
02:01:14.101 --> 02:01:17.650
and obviously you rattled off all the successful pdws that came out of this

1876
02:01:17.651 --> 02:01:22.150
horrible situation,
but that openness,

1877
02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:27.180
that open mind as leaders and and as subordinates to say,

1878
02:01:27.971 --> 02:01:32.890
look,
I'm getting this advice right.
This is so called advice from the boss.

1879
02:01:33.070 --> 02:01:36.700
I respect it,
I'm going to act on it.
Not because I have to,

1880
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:39.980
but because I understand the mission.
I understand we're doing

1881
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:43.430
<v 2>this and therefore it's not something that's being imposed on me.</v>

1882
02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:47.630
It's something that I am accepting and pushing forward of my own accord.

1883
02:01:48.230 --> 02:01:50.820
That's a huge difference.
It truly is.
I,

1884
02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:54.410
but I must admit that when I first heard about this,

1885
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:59.990
I was taken aback and I'm thinking,
you know,
this is really silly.

1886
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:04.190
I've got some senior officer down to the end cell,
this cell block,

1887
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:09.180
and he's putting more restrictions on me than it already have.
You know,
what way?

1888
02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:12.020
What's it going to do?
So take away my liberty card.

1889
02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:18.770
Throw you in the Brig.
Yeah,
I'm me to break,
um,
there,
uh,

1890
02:02:18.771 --> 02:02:23.090
and um,
uh,
and I had to be convinced,
you know,

1891
02:02:23.091 --> 02:02:27.610
that this was in our best interest.
Uh,
but,

1892
02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:29.420
but it,
it truly was.

1893
02:02:29.450 --> 02:02:34.450
And obviously that's the reason we came out as healthy as we did was because we,

1894
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:39.540
we,
well,
you say it better than most discipline.
You know,

1895
02:02:39.630 --> 02:02:41.900
a discipline brought about freedom.

1896
02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:47.660
And it was kind of crazy because we were being restricted even more.

1897
02:02:47.690 --> 02:02:51.070
And yet because of the restriction we had unity,
which gave us the freedom.
Yeah.

1898
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.550
Yeah.

1899
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:57.550
And then you guys started taking the broad code of conduct and specifying it

1900
02:02:58.670 --> 02:03:02.630
cause you guys had so much time into these things that you called plums.
Right.

1901
02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:05.570
And you didn't really know what the establishment of word poems came from,

1902
02:03:05.571 --> 02:03:06.140
but they were,

1903
02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:11.140
they were detailed to tenants of how you all were going to carry yourself and

1904
02:03:12.261 --> 02:03:15.020
you called him plums and they were things like the order that you were going to

1905
02:03:15.021 --> 02:03:17.150
go home.
Um,
you know,

1906
02:03:17.151 --> 02:03:20.850
not aiding the Vietnamese and in whitewashed and the truths,

1907
02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:22.880
the resistance,
how,

1908
02:03:22.881 --> 02:03:26.900
what level of resistance you were going to give when you were,
when you were

1909
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:30.830
interrogated,
how much resistance you were going to give with.

1910
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:35.660
And retcon six was just,
you know,
military bearing.

1911
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:38.780
And then Rez con one was straight up hunger strike.

1912
02:03:41.570 --> 02:03:44.540
That was one of the greatest displays I think,
uh,

1913
02:03:44.541 --> 02:03:49.541
that really affected the enemy was when they found out that when our commanding

1914
02:03:50.751 --> 02:03:54.830
officer of a,
of a camp could say,
okay,
rest con three,

1915
02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:59.630
no more bowing to the enemy.
And so throughout the camp,

1916
02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:02.150
in these individual cells,
you know,
there might be,

1917
02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:07.460
it might be 75 different cells and suddenly at the stroke of one,

1918
02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:11.270
one button,
you know,
nobody would bow to the guards.

1919
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:14.780
And it really frightened them to know that we had that much control,

1920
02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:18.800
that much unity.
And it was a silly thing,
but it,

1921
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:22.440
but it really felt so good that we had that,

1922
02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.370
that we had some leverage here.
And,
and the,

1923
02:04:26.410 --> 02:04:28.130
the other thing was that how you stayed,

1924
02:04:28.131 --> 02:04:32.360
you unified was by not accepting favors.

1925
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:34.790
And then you had to just the dichotomy of leadership,
right?

1926
02:04:34.791 --> 02:04:38.000
You got to balance between,
hey,
if I can accept favor and it's gonna

1927
02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:40.290
<v 3>help us and it's gonna make me healthier,
it's going to,</v>

1928
02:04:40.530 --> 02:04:45.240
then I should probably do it.
But then they put this,
then the commander,

1929
02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:50.300
the SRO would put a restriction or a reasonable timeframe.

1930
02:04:50.401 --> 02:04:53.190
So this was a classic example cause I already talked about how,
how,

1931
02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:58.290
how in love you were with pencils at this point.
At some point you got a pencil,

1932
02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.011
somehow you've got to put,

1933
02:04:59.011 --> 02:05:03.480
they gave you a pencil and you know the word spread that you guys had a pencil.

1934
02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:08.790
And the,
the,
the report or the,
the direction came back was,
okay,

1935
02:05:08.791 --> 02:05:12.600
you have 30 days to get more pencils so we're all equal.

1936
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:16.260
Or you got to give the pencil back and you didn't get any more pencils and you

1937
02:05:16.261 --> 02:05:19.350
had to give that pencil back.
Yup.
That's,

1938
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.980
but that you can see how when you,
uh,
how unified you are and how,

1939
02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:28.920
just like you said,
that shows the,
the,

1940
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:33.480
the guards and the camp leaders,
hey,
we are a unified,

1941
02:05:33.630 --> 02:05:35.340
but you can't break us.
You can't give,

1942
02:05:35.341 --> 02:05:38.180
you can't give somebody some special help and not give it to everyone.
Yeah.

1943
02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:40.293
Unbelievable.

1944
02:05:41.010 --> 02:05:45.900
Now you started talking about this a little earlier and I had to do a little bit

1945
02:05:45.901 --> 02:05:48.150
deeper on it because I think it hits a parting message,
right?

1946
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:51.840
So when you talk about living with somebody and how when you're living with

1947
02:05:51.841 --> 02:05:55.230
somebody and the furthest you can get away from him is eight feet.

1948
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:58.010
That's sometimes I feel like this with echo and we're,
you know,

1949
02:05:58.170 --> 02:05:59.220
we're not going to live with this guy,

1950
02:05:59.221 --> 02:06:03.630
but sitting in this pod gasping for air and you start saying,
okay,
that's good.

1951
02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:06.510
What,
what things start to grind on you and irritate you.

1952
02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:08.610
So whether they were exercising,

1953
02:06:08.611 --> 02:06:10.950
you get a guy that's going to exercise while you're trying to sleep,

1954
02:06:10.951 --> 02:06:12.840
where you get a guy that's snores,

1955
02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:16.800
which if you've ever dealt with somebody that snores,
made,
can't help,

1956
02:06:16.801 --> 02:06:21.450
but they don't even know that they sound like a chainsaw in your room and your

1957
02:06:21.451 --> 02:06:24.960
deal with you might get roomed up with somebody that snores every single night.

1958
02:06:25.410 --> 02:06:28.740
And the worst thing about somebody that snores is when you start thinking that

1959
02:06:28.741 --> 02:06:33.450
it bothers you,
it bothers you.
Even write pacing.

1960
02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:36.000
Pacing was another thing that would,
you know,

1961
02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:38.610
I'm gonna just could get up and pace and hey man,
just sit down.

1962
02:06:38.730 --> 02:06:43.650
So all these things,
some pow ate rice,
a grain at a time,

1963
02:06:44.490 --> 02:06:48.510
a grain at a time.
And you know,

1964
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:52.050
like on all these little,
these little,

1965
02:06:54.450 --> 02:06:58.950
I guess these little idiosyncrasies,
right?
And what are you eventually said was,

1966
02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:04.410
I'm going to take those 80 oh secrecies that bothers me about you and I'm going

1967
02:07:04.411 --> 02:07:07.650
to take the blame on myself.
I shouldn't be bothered by this.

1968
02:07:07.651 --> 02:07:09.990
And I'm the one that can't let it bother me.

1969
02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:14.490
And that is a huge difference to what most people do,

1970
02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:18.930
which is,
hey,
it's all about me and if you're bothering me,
you need to change.

1971
02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:22.620
And you're all,
his attitude was,
no,
you know what?
My attitudes,

1972
02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:24.900
you don't need to change.
I need to change.

1973
02:07:24.930 --> 02:07:28.260
I need to become more accepting of the way you are.

1974
02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:32.220
That's a big deal that you can make that transition in your life and can be a

1975
02:07:32.221 --> 02:07:35.950
much happier first.
That's true.
And I'm,
I'm still trying

1976
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:43.310
<v 2>eats.</v>

1977
02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:48.100
It's one of those things where it really is a game changer because now you know

1978
02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:49.280
it's extreme ownership,
right?

1979
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:51.390
I'm not going to blame everything on you for annoying me.

1980
02:07:51.391 --> 02:07:53.750
I'm going to take it on myself.
And then sometimes you would,

1981
02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:54.950
you'd have something that really,

1982
02:07:54.951 --> 02:07:57.350
like maybe you couldn't sleep and now you've got to talk to somebody else and

1983
02:07:57.351 --> 02:08:00.200
have,
have an indirect conversation.
Instead of saying,

1984
02:08:00.230 --> 02:08:03.260
a echo's really bothering me,
clicking his pen over there,

1985
02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:05.690
it's going to drive me crazy.

1986
02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:10.500
Can you maybe talk to him about his pen etiquette and have him stop that because

1987
02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:12.510
you're not doing it today.
But there was a,

1988
02:08:12.511 --> 02:08:15.680
there was an episode where he had the pen in his hand.

1989
02:08:15.681 --> 02:08:20.210
Things got a little bit fidgety and,
uh,
I didn't let it bother me.

1990
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:21.163
You know what I did?
Yeah.

1991
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:23.140
Brought them a new pen that didn't have the clicker on it.

1992
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:27.770
That's a partnership for that situation.
You know,
in today's world,

1993
02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:32.660
we have so many people that are so offended by certain things and,
and it's,

1994
02:08:32.661 --> 02:08:37.310
it's the same principle there is that if you offend me,

1995
02:08:37.610 --> 02:08:41.390
that's really more my problem than it is your problem.
You know,
it's,
uh,

1996
02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:46.050
I'm the one that decides if you offend me.
So,

1997
02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:50.760
so I need to change my idea of what's offensive.
Uh,

1998
02:08:52.590 --> 02:08:55.200
<v 0>one of the things that,
and,
and you know,
we're,
we're,</v>

1999
02:08:55.201 --> 02:08:58.230
it's easy to sit and laugh here a little bit about some of this stuff,

2000
02:08:58.231 --> 02:09:02.910
but one of your chapters is called insanity.
And,

2001
02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:04.860
um,
I'm going to the book here.

2002
02:09:04.861 --> 02:09:09.861
The first I knew of it was in the fall of 1968 and I didn't understand an old

2003
02:09:10.351 --> 02:09:14.340
beat up French ambulance ramp rattled into the courtyard and an American wearing

2004
02:09:14.341 --> 02:09:15.570
prison garb crawl bout.

2005
02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:19.170
He weaved like a robot with head down and shoulders slumped.

2006
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:23.280
It was odd guards never allowed POW is to walk that way.

2007
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.440
We devil timed.
Who was this man?
Had he just come from the hospital?

2008
02:09:28.530 --> 02:09:31.380
Was He tortured into semi consciousness or was he faking?

2009
02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:36.560
When would we find out the man was hallucinatory insisting that his cellmates

2010
02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:41.850
were communists piece together with limbs and heads of dead Americans.

2011
02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.810
Whose arm is that?
He asked,
is that my pilot's arm?

2012
02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:48.930
How can you call me,
speak such good English?

2013
02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:51.900
Because this man was wasting away,

2014
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:54.300
was necessary for his cellmates to force feed him.

2015
02:09:54.930 --> 02:09:57.000
The hostile patient was still strong,

2016
02:09:57.001 --> 02:10:00.990
requiring four or five men to constrain him so that a bamboo stick could be

2017
02:10:00.991 --> 02:10:05.250
forced between his teeth.
Another prisoner mashed rice down his throat.

2018
02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.271
When they finished,

2019
02:10:06.271 --> 02:10:09.630
he would gag himself to regurgitate what he thought was poisoned from the

2020
02:10:09.631 --> 02:10:14.250
Communists,
spewing rice all over the room.
He was in trance.

2021
02:10:14.730 --> 02:10:18.180
When the Vietnamese entered the room,
he refused to bow,

2022
02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:21.390
angered a guard,
scream,
Bao,
Bao,

2023
02:10:21.450 --> 02:10:26.220
and whipped his fist across the expressionless face.
The man continued to stand.

2024
02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:29.370
The guards continued to beat him.
UNMERCIFULLY

2025
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:33.620
and you guys can send you to see this.
Every six months or so,

2026
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:38.360
we saw our sick pow comrade transported between solitary confinement and the

2027
02:10:38.361 --> 02:10:40.970
hospital.
We felt helpless.

2028
02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:46.480
The only way we could assist was with prayer after September,

2029
02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:48.320
1970.
We never saw him again.

2030
02:10:50.610 --> 02:10:54.270
<v 2>There's a little more to that story that I did not know when I wrote the book</v>

2031
02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:58.770
that he had been a part of a,
of an experiment.
Then by a Cuban,

2032
02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:04.470
uh,
the Cuban came over to the communist country.
And as near as we could tell,

2033
02:11:04.710 --> 02:11:09.710
his sole purpose of being in Vietnam was to establish the breaking point of an

2034
02:11:10.201 --> 02:11:14.430
American fighting man.
And so this guy that I'm talking about in the book,

2035
02:11:14.850 --> 02:11:17.220
and I didn't,
didn't know his name at the time,
I wrote the book,

2036
02:11:17.290 --> 02:11:22.220
Earl Cobell was actually tortured to insanity.
Uh,
and that's,

2037
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:27.090
and that is why he was insane.
And,
uh,

2038
02:11:27.091 --> 02:11:31.560
and so his roommates then,
he was very belligerent and eh,
I mean,

2039
02:11:31.561 --> 02:11:35.520
here's another leadership principle cause you've got a group of guys in that

2040
02:11:35.521 --> 02:11:38.790
prison cell that were being threatened and some of them were,
were,

2041
02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:42.090
had broken bones or lacerations because of this crazy man.

2042
02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:47.310
He goes on a hunger strike in,
it's going to kill himself by not eating.

2043
02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:51.420
And they had to decide whether or not they were going to force feed him and keep

2044
02:11:51.421 --> 02:11:56.160
him alive and bring him back to his belligerence or let him die.

2045
02:11:56.850 --> 02:11:57.960
And so it was,

2046
02:11:57.961 --> 02:12:02.370
it was quite a dilemma in the prison camp and quite a dramatic time,
uh,

2047
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:05.670
when that was happening.
And,
and they did,

2048
02:12:05.671 --> 02:12:08.950
they force feed him and brought him back to health.
And then,
uh,

2049
02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:12.870
the Vietnamese for reasonable,
we never really knew,

2050
02:12:12.871 --> 02:12:17.871
but possibly because they saw that we had some control and they didn't want us

2051
02:12:17.971 --> 02:12:20.640
to have that control.
They pulled him out of that cell,

2052
02:12:20.641 --> 02:12:25.170
put him in solitary confinement and,
and then he died,
uh,
after that.

2053
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:29.400
But uh,
but it was a,
it was a tragic event,
uh,

2054
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:33.780
that a guy would be tortured to the point of insanity.

2055
02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:39.210
And that was the purpose of the torture.
Thinks it exactly there you said,

2056
02:12:39.211 --> 02:12:40.850
you said they were the purpose and on purpose.

2057
02:12:40.851 --> 02:12:43.290
It's perfectly [inaudible] sticking point.
Yeah.
To find the breaking point.

2058
02:12:43.291 --> 02:12:45.320
And they found it with this,
with coble

2059
02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:50.490
<v 0>you have another chapter,</v>

2060
02:12:50.491 --> 02:12:53.130
and we touched on this a little bit earlier about faith.

2061
02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:57.450
Going back to the book of I will be dumb.
That will be done.

2062
02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:02.540
It seem presumptuous to try to change God's will to make a deal with the

2063
02:13:02.941 --> 02:13:03.774
omnipotent.

2064
02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:08.520
If I promise to devote my life to the ministry extreme in exchange for freedom

2065
02:13:08.730 --> 02:13:12.800
and failed to follow through what then?
No.

2066
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:17.240
Trying to bargain with God was unfitting from the beginning.

2067
02:13:17.241 --> 02:13:19.040
I offered prayers of acceptance.

2068
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:23.750
I remembered the experience of seeing the Christ light shadow in the Green Nabil

2069
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:27.410
Room and the comfort I felt in that time of great need.

2070
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:32.670
That day I asked God for strength under whatever hardship I might face and I

2071
02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:36.780
prayed for an not for her fidelity or success,

2072
02:13:36.930 --> 02:13:39.240
but for tolerance,
courage,

2073
02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:44.190
and most of all her happiness with or without me.

2074
02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:48.000
I continued to this daily prayer.

2075
02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:56.220
Now this was faith was not just yours but everyone in.

2076
02:13:57.251 --> 02:14:02.251
Here we go again showing some of the power that you guys had as prisoners.

2077
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:04.601
Back to the book.

2078
02:14:04.601 --> 02:14:08.830
Thousands of bibles had been sent to us from church groups all over the world,

2079
02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.720
but the Vietnamese gave us none.
Asking wasn't enough,

2080
02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:15.940
so we decided to go on a hunger strike.

2081
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:21.700
Our senior officer informed the Vietnamese that we simply didn't want more food

2082
02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:26.200
until we could have a bible,
an uninterrupted worship.

2083
02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:30.880
They retaliated by shutting off our drinking water.
After a few days,

2084
02:14:30.881 --> 02:14:34.330
the Vietnamese were ready to settle and so were we.

2085
02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.280
They would give us a church service.
If we abided by certain stipulations,

2086
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:43.570
the service would be held according to their schedule.
No one could sing,

2087
02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:47.530
no one could stand and everyone to here strictly to camp regulations.

2088
02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.960
Every word spoken in the ceremony was to be written down for the sensors
perusal.

2089
02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:56.710
After all the restrictions,
we hadn't gained much,

2090
02:14:57.490 --> 02:15:02.200
but at least the V had given an inch.
After a few weeks later,

2091
02:15:02.650 --> 02:15:05.230
the V saw that our services,

2092
02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:08.230
we're not militant and relaxed restrictions.

2093
02:15:09.010 --> 02:15:12.910
They permitted a Forman choir to sing to hymns.
Most important.

2094
02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.430
They gave us a Bible for two days.

2095
02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:16.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2096
02:15:18.130 --> 02:15:22.850
<v 2>So you guys decided to hold the line on that one?
We did.
And um,</v>

2097
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:24.700
and it wasn't easy.
They,

2098
02:15:25.410 --> 02:15:28.480
an interesting thing back to the leadership was the,

2099
02:15:28.481 --> 02:15:33.481
the guy who promoted this was a very staunch Christian Guy.

2100
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:38.610
The number two in command was an atheist.
And,
and,

2101
02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:38.931
and,

2102
02:15:38.931 --> 02:15:43.720
and really had no great interest in having the Bible in the cell.

2103
02:15:44.050 --> 02:15:48.060
And so when the number one guy,
um,

2104
02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:51.700
told the Vietnamese that we were going to go on a hunger strike,

2105
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:52.751
they hauled them out of there,

2106
02:15:52.751 --> 02:15:55.750
that they took him away so that the number two guy,

2107
02:15:55.751 --> 02:15:57.790
the atheist was suddenly in charge.

2108
02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:01.330
And it was interesting to watch what was going to happen here.

2109
02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:06.070
And it was very encouraging when the atheist said,
continue the hunger strike,

2110
02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:10.090
we're going to get this Bible.
That's awesome.

2111
02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:11.573
You talk about

2112
02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:15.780
<v 0>their perception of the Vietnamese perception of,</v>

2113
02:16:15.930 --> 02:16:17.520
of religion in general.

2114
02:16:18.090 --> 02:16:21.480
Back to the book of the large majority of Vietnamese were not Catholic.
However,

2115
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:25.680
and when they discovered us in prayer as they did only the last year,

2116
02:16:25.681 --> 02:16:29.130
they asked what,
what you derive from this thing?
God.

2117
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:32.770
We tried to explain that we received strength,
comfort,
help,

2118
02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:37.540
and promise of eternal life.
These concepts were too difficult for them,

2119
02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:42.840
yet many seemed interested and did not mock our beliefs to the diehard

2120
02:16:43.570 --> 02:16:47.590
Vietnamese communist.
The state was their God,

2121
02:16:48.310 --> 02:16:50.950
their truth,
their way.
They're light,

2122
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:55.090
the controlling body and the government decreed infallible cannons without fear

2123
02:16:55.091 --> 02:16:59.680
of correction.
Whenever peasants asked who is the state,

2124
02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:04.630
they were told that they themselves were and that they had control and making

2125
02:17:04.631 --> 02:17:08.440
decisions.
Each was told that he was part of the [inaudible] state.

2126
02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:12.790
He was,
as long as he didn't interfere,

2127
02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:18.270
I consider my confinement in prison to be spiritually beneficial.

2128
02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:23.100
I was given an opportunity that few men have the time to pause,

2129
02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:26.040
to reflect and to establish priorities.

2130
02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:30.060
I found that my previous value system was unrealistic,

2131
02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:32.760
stripped of all my material wealth,

2132
02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.320
the only beacon I could home home in on was my faith.

2133
02:17:37.530 --> 02:17:39.200
It an unchanging God.

2134
02:17:42.030 --> 02:17:42.863
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2135
02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:50.060
<v 0>and you also went very deep on thoughts around patriotism</v>

2136
02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:55.740
and here's your toss.
Talking about patriotism.

2137
02:17:55.741 --> 02:17:59.460
Some pdws were super patriots feeling.

2138
02:17:59.461 --> 02:18:01.200
The United States could do no wrong.

2139
02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.360
A few felt that we had made a mistake and then it was time for us to get out

2140
02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:11.940
with most of the prisoners.
I accepted the fact that we were not perfect,

2141
02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.100
but felt that we were fighting for a worthy cause and should persevere until the

2142
02:18:17.101 --> 02:18:22.080
end.
And this is something I brought up on many occasions.

2143
02:18:22.081 --> 02:18:25.020
The fact of how hard we were.
No,

2144
02:18:25.021 --> 02:18:29.040
I fought in the war in Iraq and we went through extreme measures to try and

2145
02:18:29.370 --> 02:18:32.160
protect the civilian populace and the civilian infrastructure.

2146
02:18:32.161 --> 02:18:34.260
And here's your comments on that.
Back to the book,

2147
02:18:34.290 --> 02:18:38.310
great efforts were made to persevere the lives and property of civilians.

2148
02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:42.900
Pilots were threatened with court martial if they failed to pinpoint accurate

2149
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:44.460
military targets,

2150
02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:49.080
even to the extent that they would jeopardize their own lives by swooping just

2151
02:18:49.081 --> 02:18:54.081
above tree tops to preserve a peasant hut 50 yards from a Sam radar scope.

2152
02:18:55.500 --> 02:19:00.450
The Vietnamese capitalizing on this may targets especially difficult by placing

2153
02:19:00.451 --> 02:19:04.950
their military equipment in the middle of peasant hamlets or next to schools.

2154
02:19:05.490 --> 02:19:06.120
In fact,

2155
02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:10.890
several antiaircraft artillery guns were stationed on hospital rooftops

2156
02:19:14.330 --> 02:19:16.700
and your,
your thoughts about the involvement here,

2157
02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:21.820
the most powerful free nation in history could not idly watch the communist

2158
02:19:22.761 --> 02:19:26.330
world gobble up and dissolve sovereign nations.

2159
02:19:27.350 --> 02:19:32.270
We had to play the surgeon to excise the malignant disease of mind control.

2160
02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.090
I don't condone war.

2161
02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:38.750
I think there are few justifiable reasons for killing.

2162
02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:45.460
In Vietnam.
War was a last ditch effort of international diplomacy.

2163
02:19:45.670 --> 02:19:50.260
It was difficult to justify my six years of imprisonment when politicians with

2164
02:19:50.261 --> 02:19:54.700
expense paid trips to Paris should have solved the problems through negotiation.

2165
02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.860
In this case,
our negotiations,
we're at the end of their rope.

2166
02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:06.610
The communist didn't understand anything but the big hammer when our be 50 twos

2167
02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:09.800
shattered her noise defenses with thousands of bombs.

2168
02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:13.220
The Vietnamese realized we meant business

2169
02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:22.680
and this thought here we faced east once a week and pledge our allegiance.

2170
02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:30.380
We contracted our bill of rights and the Constitution to the communist manifesto

2171
02:20:32.830 --> 02:20:37.270
daily.
We saw how big brother destroyed individuality.

2172
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:38.920
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2173
02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:43.920
<v 0>We compared our lot with that of the guards while prisoners of war were behind</v>

2174
02:20:46.301 --> 02:20:47.134
bars,

2175
02:20:47.230 --> 02:20:51.820
the Vietnamese war captives inside their own bamboo borders.

2176
02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:53.480
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2177
02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:57.470
<v 0>We consider ourselves more fortunate than day.</v>

2178
02:20:58.260 --> 02:20:58.740
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2179
02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:01.890
<v 0>One day we would leave our cells.</v>

2180
02:21:06.490 --> 02:21:11.490
<v 2>Powerful statement and that's exactly the way we thought was that that they were</v>

2181
02:21:12.701 --> 02:21:17.080
the prisoners and we weren't.
We were always,
we were always

2182
02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:22.630
of the belief that we would go home and they had to stay there.
You know,
they,

2183
02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:26.710
they,
they had to stay in their prison and we would eventually be released.

2184
02:21:29.650 --> 02:21:31.750
<v 0>And you were right.</v>

2185
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:37.360
And during the week of 21 to 28,
January,
1973 for the first time,

2186
02:21:37.361 --> 02:21:39.220
treatment was actually humane.

2187
02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:44.380
The Vietnamese set up a volleyball net and allowed us to play or to exercise.

2188
02:21:44.590 --> 02:21:48.820
They gave us books and magazines from home.
We knew something was happening.

2189
02:21:50.050 --> 02:21:54.040
So you guys started to sense that
there was,
and you,

2190
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:56.500
and you talk about this in the book.
I didn't go into it much,

2191
02:21:56.501 --> 02:21:59.740
but there was always some people that were,
uh,
what'd you call it?

2192
02:21:59.741 --> 02:22:03.070
The people that would look at the amount of food you got?
Oh yes,
they would,

2193
02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:08.160
they would read the amount of rice you'd be given as to some foreseeing the

2194
02:22:08.381 --> 02:22:10.690
future of how long you're going to be in there for what you call him in the
book.

2195
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:13.540
<v 2>Uh,
we call them,
um,
I forgot</v>

2196
02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:18.010
<v 0>like food at Terry and
no gas drawn numbers.
Yes.</v>

2197
02:22:18.090 --> 02:22:21.830
Astronomers,
astronomers,
anyone.

2198
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:25.220
That's all they gave us more rice.
We must be getting ready to be released.

2199
02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.040
And you have that

2200
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.200
<v 2>feeling,
it sounds like,
you know,
once a year,
once,</v>

2201
02:22:29.290 --> 02:22:32.430
once every 18 months out.
Oh yeah.

2202
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:34.770
Well of course it depended on the person,

2203
02:22:34.771 --> 02:22:38.500
but some of the guys were so optimistic and uh,

2204
02:22:39.020 --> 02:22:43.950
and I was an optimist,
you know,
I've,
I would think a,
you know,
home,
in fact,

2205
02:22:43.951 --> 02:22:46.380
when I was first shot down,
uh,
I,

2206
02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:50.520
I thought we had finally given him the big blow.
You know,

2207
02:22:50.521 --> 02:22:54.330
we finally brought them to their knees on the 19th of May and,

2208
02:22:54.530 --> 02:22:56.700
and the first few days in prison or that,
you know,

2209
02:22:56.701 --> 02:23:00.720
this is really going to be our Ronnie because of the war is over and I fly home

2210
02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:03.270
and,
and my squadron has to take the ship home.

2211
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:07.550
I will be there to greet them when they come home.
It doesn't matter.

2212
02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:10.470
He is the positive attitude that is optimistic.

2213
02:23:10.471 --> 02:23:13.350
Those poor guys have to ride the ship back.
I'm going to be home before then.

2214
02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:18.720
Oh Man.
That's like I was,
I've said this

2215
02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:22.530
<v 0>one of the podcast.
I always,
when I'm in an in a commercial aircraft flying,</v>

2216
02:23:22.770 --> 02:23:26.910
I always think if this thing blows up in the sky,
I'm going to live.

2217
02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:30.190
I'm going to be that guy for you know,
of course I'm not going to kick it.
Sure.

2218
02:23:30.270 --> 02:23:34.170
Everyone else is going to die,
not me.
Uh,

2219
02:23:34.650 --> 02:23:39.530
and so finally,
here we go.

2220
02:23:39.531 --> 02:23:40.970
Back to the book,
the Camp Commander,

2221
02:23:40.971 --> 02:23:44.390
once a game called our group together about 180 of us old timers.

2222
02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:48.290
He was the first time that all prisoners in the camp were gathered in one place.

2223
02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:53.060
We lined up by buildings in military formation and we're called to attention by

2224
02:23:53.061 --> 02:23:57.260
our acting wing commander,
lieutenant colonel,
norm Gattis.

2225
02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:01.670
Although Vietnamese officials did not recognize our rank structure,

2226
02:24:01.671 --> 02:24:02.510
they said nothing.

2227
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:07.370
The camp commander read an announcement and the interpreter read the
translation.

2228
02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:10.920
It had been a long time since I'd heard English words.

2229
02:24:10.970 --> 02:24:15.470
So professionally when he finished and told us we could go,

2230
02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.030
our wing commander again called us to attention and dismissed us with bowed

2231
02:24:20.031 --> 02:24:23.960
heads.
With heads bowed,
we walked quietly back to our rooms.

2232
02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:25.730
We were stunned.

2233
02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:31.570
Some had waited for these words for over eight and one half years of the war was

2234
02:24:33.141 --> 02:24:35.840
over.
We were going home.

2235
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:41.063
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2236
02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:45.950
<v 2>Did that even feel real at that point?
You have to get your hopes up.</v>

2237
02:24:45.951 --> 02:24:50.450
So many times it really didn't.
And they tried to trick us many times.
You know,

2238
02:24:50.451 --> 02:24:53.960
they would call us in,
Hey,
sign this confession,
we'll send you home.

2239
02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:58.910
And uh,
and so even when it happened for real,

2240
02:24:59.510 --> 02:25:01.700
it,
it,
we couldn't believe it.

2241
02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:05.180
It wasn't really until we find that I've got a board that,
uh,

2242
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:09.110
that see one 41 and it took off the wheels in the well,

2243
02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:11.660
and when there was a little,
uh,

2244
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:16.790
a little bit of a administrative situation when it came time,

2245
02:25:16.791 --> 02:25:19.820
cause you guys had all new that you're gonna follow the order that you are

2246
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:24.130
capitol of the sick and injured.
We're going to go first,

2247
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:27.310
<v 0>then the enlisted guys,
we're going to go and then order of capture.</v>

2248
02:25:27.310 --> 02:25:30.580
<v 2>Exactly.
And that was part of the plums.
Right.
Okay.
That,
that was,</v>

2249
02:25:30.581 --> 02:25:35.320
that was part of all of the rules that had,
that,
that we've were abiding by.

2250
02:25:35.890 --> 02:25:38.680
And so we were in,

2251
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:42.910
we were numbered,
okay.
Sick and ancient guys got a went whoa.

2252
02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:44.800
And then it was our turn,

2253
02:25:44.801 --> 02:25:49.801
but by number of the date of Sudan and they pulled 20 of us out that were out of

2254
02:25:50.471 --> 02:25:53.890
order of the shoot down date.
And,
uh,

2255
02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:58.780
we made a big deal of this and a that.
And they,
they told us,
well,

2256
02:25:58.810 --> 02:26:00.100
Kissinger told us that we,

2257
02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:05.290
we almost caused an international incident because for whatever reason that we

2258
02:26:05.291 --> 02:26:07.000
really never knew for sure,

2259
02:26:07.001 --> 02:26:10.900
except that all 20 of us had,

2260
02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:16.150
um,
had some,
some disappointing,
um,
uh,

2261
02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:21.160
feature to our return.
And we never knew if that was the reason or not,

2262
02:26:21.161 --> 02:26:26.020
but we review either coming back to deaths in the family or disease or divorce

2263
02:26:26.021 --> 02:26:28.900
or that kind of thing.
All 20 guys.
And so,

2264
02:26:28.901 --> 02:26:33.310
but we were out of order and we did not know why we were out of order.
And so we,

2265
02:26:33.430 --> 02:26:38.430
we told them we weren't going home and he went back and forth for almost a day,

2266
02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:40.530
uh,
that we really

2267
02:26:40.850 --> 02:26:44.930
<v 0>to go home and then find the,
uh,
Colonel Gaddis just pulled you in and said,</v>

2268
02:26:44.931 --> 02:26:48.620
listen,
you guys are going home.
He gave us the direct order.

2269
02:26:55.810 --> 02:26:56.643
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2270
02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:00.040
<v 0>And then you get to the airport at the airport,</v>

2271
02:27:00.041 --> 02:27:02.260
the bus halted near pockmark runways.

2272
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:08.110
We exited solidly through a crowd of people and by microphone we were told to

2273
02:27:09.341 --> 02:27:13.120
walk to our receiving officer when our names were called.
As I heard my name,

2274
02:27:13.121 --> 02:27:16.480
I stepped past a table where Vietnamese and American representatives marked off

2275
02:27:16.481 --> 02:27:17.350
the exchange.

2276
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:22.450
I saluted the colonel than another and was escorted by an officer who was so

2277
02:27:22.451 --> 02:27:25.510
excited he could have,
he could say nothing more than,
isn't it great?

2278
02:27:25.630 --> 02:27:28.660
It's so nice to have you back.
We've all been waiting for you.
Isn't it great?

2279
02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:32.260
I felt as though he had previously composed what he would say,

2280
02:27:32.290 --> 02:27:36.310
but in his excitement,
his record stuck.
He was right.

2281
02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:37.933
That was great.

2282
02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:42.130
I walked up on the ramp of the [inaudible] 41 and saw the first navy uniform.

2283
02:27:42.970 --> 02:27:46.120
The officer inside that uniform grabbed me and hugged me and told me his name.

2284
02:27:46.330 --> 02:27:49.810
I didn't know him until he told me he was the briefing officer on the Kitty
Hawk.

2285
02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:51.070
The day I was shot down,

2286
02:27:52.030 --> 02:27:56.800
Gary Mauro and I had once worked many hours together and now we can joyfully

2287
02:27:56.801 --> 02:27:58.360
recall old times.

2288
02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:03.190
As soon as I was in the airplane and nurse kissed me and started the first of a

2289
02:28:03.191 --> 02:28:04.850
long chain of flash bulbs,

2290
02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.010
we were given American cigarettes magazines than information sheets telling us

2291
02:28:09.011 --> 02:28:10.960
what to expect at Clark Air Force Base.

2292
02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:14.710
The pilot taxi down the runway pushed off,

2293
02:28:14.711 --> 02:28:19.630
pushed the throttles and at the moment of liftoff,
suddenly it hit us.

2294
02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:21.860
We were off north Vietnamese soil.

2295
02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:26.300
We screamed above the noise of the engines minutes later,

2296
02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:31.190
who you're soaring above the Gulf of Tonkin and saw some of our ships.

2297
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:36.670
The commander of the Seventh Fleet sent a message of welcome and Jim returned to

2298
02:28:36.941 --> 02:28:41.530
the radio comm with a thankful acknowledgement by nightfall.

2299
02:28:41.650 --> 02:28:45.790
We reached the Philippines and Clark Air Force Base.
As soon as the doors opened,

2300
02:28:45.791 --> 02:28:49.930
we could see and hear the enthusiasm from what must have been 5,000 people,

2301
02:28:50.530 --> 02:28:54.970
banners and bans,
choral groups and cheerleaders.
Everyone seemed to be there.

2302
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:59.890
I walked down the ramp,
saluted a general and then an outro.

2303
02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:04.450
As I shook the admiral's hand,
I was so overcome with emotion

2304
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:06.503
<v 1>that I hugged him.</v>

2305
02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:14.900
<v 0>So you hugged the admiral?
That was embarrassing.</v>

2306
02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:23.120
I don't know why I did that.
Uh,
you know,
it was just maybe take a stab.

2307
02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:30.170
I would augment.
Kissed him.
Who'd been on.

2308
02:29:30.890 --> 02:29:34.130
Thank you sir.
Yes sir.

2309
02:29:34.131 --> 02:29:37.300
You're allowed to hug the animal when you come home after that.
No,
that's good.

2310
02:29:37.410 --> 02:29:41.470
I could tell what you wrote that you were sort of like what I just do exactly

2311
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:46.510
overcome with emotions and then you start kind of the in processing thing and

2312
02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:51.410
I'm that I had to be,
when they started handing you magazines,

2313
02:29:51.411 --> 02:29:54.440
it's cigarettes and food and all that and you go into that somewhat in here

2314
02:29:54.450 --> 02:29:58.640
where they're just,
how overwhelming is that?
That was wonderful.

2315
02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:01.860
It was joyful.
You know,

2316
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:06.910
I was reading through some Vietnam pow poetry and I got caught,

2317
02:30:09.970 --> 02:30:14.030
you know,
I was just looking for background.
I want to learn more and you know,

2318
02:30:14.210 --> 02:30:18.290
people express themselves and poetry and I've got locked into probably a dozen

2319
02:30:18.291 --> 02:30:23.291
poems that was nothing but different foods like raspberry cake and I just steak

2320
02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:29.780
in milk and chocolate milk in every fee.
It was like a thousand pounds.

2321
02:30:29.781 --> 02:30:32.470
It would just about food.
So my,

2322
02:30:32.580 --> 02:30:35.420
my favorite one was Jerry coffee wrote a poem.

2323
02:30:35.860 --> 02:30:40.820
It was called Ode to a weevil and the poem was little weeble in my bread.

2324
02:30:41.540 --> 02:30:46.310
I think I just bit off your head.
That was it.

2325
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:50.830
That was the end of the,
it was the end of the weevil too.

2326
02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:56.210
That's kind of dope.
So you guys,
you guys are,
you know,
uh,

2327
02:30:56.280 --> 02:31:00.290
that had to be somewhat overwhelming,
but you know,
like you said,
you guys,
uh,

2328
02:31:00.291 --> 02:31:04.940
you guys were,
were in good,
relatively good mental status.

2329
02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:07.480
Yeah.
Amazing.
Yeah.

2330
02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:12.890
Now as you're going through the motions with the doctors and the physical people

2331
02:31:12.891 --> 02:31:17.220
in the,
uh,
the,
uh,
the PA's,
the public affairs people,
okay.
You're saying,
hey,

2332
02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:20.910
you know what,
why don't I see my wife,
what's up with my wife?

2333
02:31:20.970 --> 02:31:25.290
And no one's really answering that question for you and find that you get the

2334
02:31:25.291 --> 02:31:30.030
chaplain and you say,
going back to the book here,
I looked up at him and said,

2335
02:31:30.031 --> 02:31:33.900
chaplain,
I have a great deal of faith in you and I want you to level with me.

2336
02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:37.830
So far I haven't been able to get a straight answer from anyone and I want to

2337
02:31:37.831 --> 02:31:41.610
know about my wife.
Would you please be kind enough to tell me what's going on?

2338
02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:47.160
And he says back,
well Charlie,
there is a problem with your wife.
She as well.

2339
02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:51.510
But she has some misgivings.
I'm not sure as to the extent,

2340
02:31:51.870 --> 02:31:53.640
but I'm sure that everything is going to be all right.

2341
02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:56.940
She's written me a letter but I didn't want to open it.

2342
02:31:58.470 --> 02:31:59.730
I felt that you should

2343
02:32:01.430 --> 02:32:05.780
and you get the letter and it's nothing crystal clear,

2344
02:32:05.781 --> 02:32:10.781
but the message is clear enough that you know she's not want to stay married to

2345
02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:14.324
you anymore.

2346
02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:20.060
And you call her

2347
02:32:21.970 --> 02:32:26.660
<v 2>the next day.
Actually he called my,
my parents first.
Okay.</v>

2348
02:32:26.890 --> 02:32:31.720
Back in Kansas.
Uh,
I tried to call her,
but,
uh,
it didn't,

2349
02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:36.610
it didn't work.
In fact,
they were,
they were very protective,
you know,

2350
02:32:36.611 --> 02:32:37.444
first of all,

2351
02:32:37.870 --> 02:32:42.700
they thought they thought I might be suicidal when I heard the news.

2352
02:32:43.090 --> 02:32:48.010
And so they were very protective of me and I,
uh,
they wouldn't,

2353
02:32:48.040 --> 02:32:50.220
they wouldn't let me call home.
Um,

2354
02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:54.970
even the chaplain in the psychiatrist and psychologist wouldn't lend called home

2355
02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:57.200
even to your parents?
Even to my parents.
Yeah.

2356
02:32:58.060 --> 02:33:02.080
They had this plan of how they were going to explain this to me,
I guess,

2357
02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:03.300
but they wouldn't let me call.

2358
02:33:03.670 --> 02:33:07.930
I finally found a social worker in the hospital,

2359
02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:11.370
you know,
hey,
I want to,
don't want to,
you got to telephone around here.

2360
02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:16.400
So I found a phone and I call my parents back in Kansas and,

2361
02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:21.600
um,
and they're the ones that actually told me,
I'll never forget my mom's words.

2362
02:33:21.601 --> 02:33:25.780
She said,
it sounded give 10 years of my life if it didn't have to tell you this,

2363
02:33:25.781 --> 02:33:29.720
but she's engaged to be married to another man.
She's,

2364
02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:34.490
she's filed for divorce.
And judge wouldn't give her a divorce.
You know,

2365
02:33:35.130 --> 02:33:39.670
the,
the um,
the justification was a abandonment,

2366
02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:40.230
you know,

2367
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:44.770
and she said her husband had had been abandoned her and the judge wasn't buying

2368
02:33:44.771 --> 02:33:47.560
that and so,
but no,

2369
02:33:47.561 --> 02:33:51.610
that was the first day I knew was when my mother told me that she had filed for

2370
02:33:51.611 --> 02:33:52.444
divorce.

2371
02:33:56.010 --> 02:34:00.210
<v 0>Um,
going back to the book here a few days later.</v>

2372
02:34:00.211 --> 02:34:01.050
So he talked to Ann.

2373
02:34:01.051 --> 02:34:05.790
But then some of the stuff you say here is I actually,

2374
02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:09.270
I just,
I just have to quote it back the book yet,

2375
02:34:09.271 --> 02:34:11.790
and had told me that she wanted to remarry,

2376
02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:16.080
I would not become an obstacle to her happiness.

2377
02:34:16.770 --> 02:34:19.900
I called her parents and they seemed quite unsettled about Ann's decision.

2378
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:23.770
A few days later I called Dan again and she complained that many members in the

2379
02:34:23.771 --> 02:34:25.420
news media had been harassing her.

2380
02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:29.440
She said she had often been misquoted and was the victim of character

2381
02:34:29.441 --> 02:34:30.280
assassination.

2382
02:34:31.090 --> 02:34:34.840
I then talked personally to some of the newspaper men and told them that I did

2383
02:34:34.841 --> 02:34:37.750
not want her to be more aligned in any way.
In fact,

2384
02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:41.920
I wanted them to say nothing at all about my wife.
For the most part.

2385
02:34:41.921 --> 02:34:44.410
They were receptive to my wishes.
I gave them a quote,

2386
02:34:44.411 --> 02:34:46.320
which they could use if they felt they had to.

2387
02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:50.800
The divorces regrettable is a real credible but inevitable drifting apart.

2388
02:34:50.801 --> 02:34:53.680
After so many years.
By this time,

2389
02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:55.840
my hope for reconciliation was dead.

2390
02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:00.250
I was determined to take it on the chin and roll with the punches.

2391
02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:07.570
<v 2>Well,
I may be coming off as a white knight here,
but it wasn't at all that way.</v>

2392
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:08.290
She,

2393
02:35:08.290 --> 02:35:13.290
I really to this day believe that in many ways the ladies had it worse than we

2394
02:35:14.621 --> 02:35:18.880
did.
You know,
and it's the,
it's the families back here.
You know what I mean?

2395
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:21.880
The military guys are over there and I'm sure you've seen this in,

2396
02:35:21.881 --> 02:35:26.650
in your experience as well,
is that we,
we believe in what we're doing.

2397
02:35:26.651 --> 02:35:30.700
We're dedicated,
we focused,
you know,
we're over there having a high old time.

2398
02:35:31.090 --> 02:35:33.100
The families back here don't have that.

2399
02:35:33.250 --> 02:35:38.250
And especially my wife didn't know if I was alive or dead from one day to the

2400
02:35:39.041 --> 02:35:43.390
next.
She went through the same years,
24 to 30 than I did.

2401
02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:47.590
She was supposed to be faithful to me and she was supposed to,
you know,

2402
02:35:47.650 --> 02:35:52.090
believe that I'd coming home,
not knowing if I'd ever come home and if I did,

2403
02:35:52.091 --> 02:35:57.070
would I still want to be married or would I be a basket case and a burden to
her,

2404
02:35:57.071 --> 02:36:01.570
the rest of her life.
And the other part of this,

2405
02:36:01.571 --> 02:36:04.360
which was,
which I didn't know at the time,
of course,

2406
02:36:04.361 --> 02:36:08.320
but she lost her support group.
You know,

2407
02:36:08.321 --> 02:36:11.140
they had a big wives club,
that's the squadron pilots.

2408
02:36:11.170 --> 02:36:14.890
All of our wives got together and they would take pictures and send us cookies

2409
02:36:14.891 --> 02:36:19.400
and make tapes and all these things.
And it was a very close knit group.
The,
the,

2410
02:36:19.401 --> 02:36:21.940
the wives of the pilots,
well,

2411
02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:25.390
when I was shot down or when anybody was killed or captured,

2412
02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:29.890
that wife was sort of summarily shunned by the rest of the group.

2413
02:36:30.900 --> 02:36:34.120
Not Officially,
but just because they didn't,

2414
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:38.800
they didn't want to,
um,

2415
02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:41.950
they didn't know what to say and they didn't want to be associated with somebody

2416
02:36:41.951 --> 02:36:44.260
who had that problem.
They didn't want,

2417
02:36:44.290 --> 02:36:48.340
they didn't want that to affect their life.
So she lost her support group.

2418
02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:50.730
She,
uh,
uh,

2419
02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:54.820
she went back to Kansas and went back to school there.

2420
02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:59.020
And then when she fell in love with this other guy,

2421
02:36:59.050 --> 02:37:03.130
she lost what support group.
She had it at home because her parents were upset.

2422
02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:06.910
My parents were upset.
I have a brother 10 years younger than I am,

2423
02:37:06.911 --> 02:37:10.070
that that looks a lot like me.
And he was of the,

2424
02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:12.760
about the same age during this,

2425
02:37:13.450 --> 02:37:16.400
the letter part of this experience that I had been when,

2426
02:37:16.450 --> 02:37:21.450
when in and I met and he would go over to mow her lawn in Kansas and she would

2427
02:37:22.581 --> 02:37:26.900
break out in hives,
serious emergency room kind of hives,

2428
02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:31.370
uh,
just at the site of my little brother because he looked like me.

2429
02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:33.660
And,
and so they finally,
uh,

2430
02:37:33.661 --> 02:37:38.661
the doctors restricted him from ever seen her because it caused her so much

2431
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:42.910
grief.
So it was tough on the ladies.
Anyway,

2432
02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:47.920
you look at it and I saw that and I felt that and I felt like I needed to do

2433
02:37:48.021 --> 02:37:51.350
whatever was necessary to give her a little piece.

2434
02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:56.650
<v 0>Well,
you might not say thank you,
came off like a white knight,</v>

2435
02:37:56.651 --> 02:38:00.610
but that's a pretty awesome treatment of someone for sure.

2436
02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:06.710
<v 2>Well,
and a lot of people,
um,
you know,
didn't understand it then and,</v>

2437
02:38:06.730 --> 02:38:08.960
and even don't understand it to today.
And you know,

2438
02:38:08.961 --> 02:38:11.690
some people want to blame her,

2439
02:38:12.370 --> 02:38:16.970
but by I have no animosity,
no blame whatsoever.
Um,

2440
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:19.630
for what she did.
I mean,
it was,
uh,

2441
02:38:21.060 --> 02:38:23.540
I have other people that will say,
well,

2442
02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:27.230
don't you wish that she had known early on that she was going to divorce you?

2443
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:30.980
No Way.
I would say no to her.
No.
Her,
her,

2444
02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:34.280
the thoughts of her kept me alive.
You know,
that was,

2445
02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:37.190
that was my purpose was to go back and be with her.

2446
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:41.360
The fact that it didn't happen.
Of course there's somewhat incidental,

2447
02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:43.490
but the six years I was there,

2448
02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:46.550
it was certainly a positive for me to think about her.

2449
02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:49.930
<v 0>And,
uh,</v>

2450
02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:54.760
you wrap up the book with a chapter called Reflections,

2451
02:38:54.761 --> 02:38:58.090
which is just phenomenal and you know,

2452
02:38:58.091 --> 02:39:02.410
looking back it kind of what you learned there.

2453
02:39:02.930 --> 02:39:06.970
I'm going to hit some of the sum of the parts of it because there's so much that

2454
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:10.390
everybody can,
can learn from this.

2455
02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:14.680
Going here to the book are closed.

2456
02:39:14.681 --> 02:39:18.850
Society subsisted we ate,
slept,
breathed.

2457
02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:23.980
We laughed and we cried.
We were frustrated and we were gratified.

2458
02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:28.270
We were embarrassed and we were proud.
Slowly,

2459
02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:33.480
almost imperceptibly particular patterns of behavior edged into our daily

2460
02:39:33.761 --> 02:39:36.430
activities and came until they became folk folkways.

2461
02:39:37.330 --> 02:39:41.530
There was nothing unusual about a man pacing the floor for hours like a caged

2462
02:39:41.531 --> 02:39:43.750
tiger.
No one,

2463
02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:49.140
no notice was given to the man lifting a soup bowl and licking it's spotless.

2464
02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:52.210
There was no stigma in baring our souls to one another.

2465
02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:55.990
We had our own Moore's and sense of propriety.

2466
02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:01.930
Our micro chasm was a petri dish containing its own strains and culture.

2467
02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:04.960
Although we had not been handpicked,

2468
02:40:05.290 --> 02:40:10.290
we were for the most part out of the same mold that of the professional officer

2469
02:40:10.421 --> 02:40:14.460
and pilot.
We were unique prisoners who acted differently

2470
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:16.920
<v 3>from those of Korea or World War II.</v>

2471
02:40:17.700 --> 02:40:22.080
We had been exposed to a different selection process and a new era of lifestyles

2472
02:40:23.010 --> 02:40:27.420
gathered together in a dubious fraternity of Hanoi's skydivers.

2473
02:40:28.770 --> 02:40:33.120
We were a group of cocky individuals.
We knew we were the best,

2474
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.570
<v 1>okay.</v>

2475
02:40:34.570 --> 02:40:39.280
<v 3>Stripped of personal possessions of million dollar airplanes of rank and</v>

2476
02:40:39.281 --> 02:40:43.030
prestige.
We suddenly found ourselves at the bottom of a dark pit.

2477
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:47.460
We could no longer look outward.

2478
02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:53.460
Our only alternative was to make the best of what we had.

2479
02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:02.800
And when you have so little and for you guys to take that attitude,

2480
02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:08.840
then there's so many people,
you know,
when I hear from people all over the world,

2481
02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.890
that will reach out to me and talk about the situation that they're in a bad

2482
02:41:12.891 --> 02:41:16.120
situation,
in a negative situation and,
and you know,

2483
02:41:16.121 --> 02:41:20.810
it's hearing from people like you that makes everyone realize I need to make the

2484
02:41:20.811 --> 02:41:23.870
best of what I have.
You know,
I need to make the best of the situation I'm in.

2485
02:41:23.900 --> 02:41:27.060
Because if you guys could do it,
anyone can.

2486
02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:34.850
<v 2>Again,
if this sounds like grand,
high level philosophy,
but it was,</v>

2487
02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:38.690
it was almost a survival technique.
You know,
it's almost,
hey,

2488
02:41:38.691 --> 02:41:42.710
this is the way that we can make it through.

2489
02:41:42.711 --> 02:41:46.190
This is a,
is believing in,

2490
02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:48.560
in the future and believing in ourselves.

2491
02:41:48.561 --> 02:41:53.561
And I look back on that six years and it was probably the most important six

2492
02:41:53.811 --> 02:41:55.730
years of my life because,

2493
02:41:56.030 --> 02:42:00.200
because I came through this silly experience with,
um,

2494
02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:04.850
with this kind of,
this kind of discipline,
it is kind of thought process that,

2495
02:42:04.851 --> 02:42:07.160
hey,
uh,
it's not the hand you're dealt.

2496
02:42:07.161 --> 02:42:10.310
It's the way you play the hand you're dealt.
And you may not have four aces this,

2497
02:42:10.311 --> 02:42:14.330
this around.
You know,
you may have trash,

2498
02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:18.920
but if you play it right,
it can still be a winning hand.

2499
02:42:21.410 --> 02:42:23.820
<v 3>A little bit of talk about you coming home.</v>

2500
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.240
Back to the book of my first impressions of home,
we're not too encouraging.

2501
02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:30.870
Newspapers and magazines were devoted largely to the drug problem.

2502
02:42:31.050 --> 02:42:33.300
Permissiveness,
the energy crisis,

2503
02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:38.420
a bounding crime rate and eroding and eroding and eroding family structures.

2504
02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:42.000
I was worried,
worried from a selfish viewpoint.

2505
02:42:42.410 --> 02:42:45.870
I had sacrificed many years from my country and I didn't want some young

2506
02:42:45.871 --> 02:42:47.460
whippersnappers destroying it,

2507
02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:52.980
but I decided to give myself a one year moratorium before taking a firm stand on

2508
02:42:52.981 --> 02:42:54.510
any of my observations.

2509
02:42:55.450 --> 02:42:56.100
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2510
02:42:56.100 --> 02:42:59.940
<v 3>And I've found that the news media in particular had exaggerated the negative.</v>

2511
02:43:01.290 --> 02:43:03.780
I didn't have my wallet stolen,
stolen,

2512
02:43:03.930 --> 02:43:08.930
nor did I see opium dens or gang wars when I visited schools instead.

2513
02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:12.190
I was pleasantly surprised with student demeanor.

2514
02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:17.760
Young people freely ask questions and showed a genuine concern for answers to

2515
02:43:17.831 --> 02:43:18.664
me.

2516
02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:23.650
They seem to have been unduly criticized by an inpatient adult society rather

2517
02:43:23.651 --> 02:43:26.500
than given,
been given wise counsel.

2518
02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:31.840
They have more freedom and I think they are generally capable of handling those

2519
02:43:31.841 --> 02:43:36.700
freedoms.
They're more mature than their counterparts of my generation.

2520
02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:39.400
They have to be to survive.

2521
02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:44.830
And one of the reasons I called that little section out is because guess what we

2522
02:43:44.831 --> 02:43:46.660
hear about the millennials right now.

2523
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:51.870
We hear the same thing about the millennials and maybe just everyone should give

2524
02:43:52.601 --> 02:43:57.130
a little moratorium on themselves.
I'm going to start imposing more and more.

2525
02:43:57.130 --> 02:43:59.290
It's Williams all myself.
I think that's a great idea.

2526
02:44:00.310 --> 02:44:03.720
Whoever started definitely doing that self imposed moratorium.
Yeah.

2527
02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:06.730
You see you here and meet with us.
You know,

2528
02:44:06.731 --> 02:44:10.270
we work with a lot of businesses and companies and people will ask us about you.

2529
02:44:10.290 --> 02:44:14.410
We got these millennials and and it's so hard to lead them.
And I say,
Oh,

2530
02:44:14.411 --> 02:44:15.100
why is that?

2531
02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:18.070
Because they want to understand why they're doing what they're doing because

2532
02:44:18.071 --> 02:44:21.500
they want to know what the goal and purpose of their of of their job is that

2533
02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:23.890
that's nothing new.
Oh.
Because there,

2534
02:44:23.950 --> 02:44:27.580
because they want to step up and run things.

2535
02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:32.110
I want that person working for me,
so

2536
02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:36.670
yeah,
put a little more him right

2537
02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:42.670
back to the book.
While in prison,
I had a lot of time to think.

2538
02:44:43.690 --> 02:44:46.870
The same question kept popping in my mind.
What am I doing here?

2539
02:44:47.230 --> 02:44:51.400
I'm 10,000 miles from home cooped up in a communist prison camp on able to enjoy

2540
02:44:51.401 --> 02:44:54.250
all the wonderful freedoms I was sent here to protect.

2541
02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:58.150
My first answer was obvious.
I'm fighting for my country.

2542
02:44:58.330 --> 02:45:00.370
I'm serving the United States of America.

2543
02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:05.230
I'd learned in school that America was Purple Mountain Majesties and amber,

2544
02:45:05.231 --> 02:45:06.490
amber waves of grain,

2545
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:10.990
that it was congress and the executive and the judiciary.

2546
02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:15.310
These were self evident,
but I had to get more personal than that.

2547
02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:20.530
America had demean more.
It had to relate to my own freedoms,

2548
02:45:20.650 --> 02:45:24.610
the product of nearly 200 years of a pioneering spirit.

2549
02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:30.550
My nation is a skinny kid who climbs on his bike before dawn to sling

2550
02:45:30.551 --> 02:45:31.450
newspapers.

2551
02:45:32.110 --> 02:45:37.110
My country is a librarian who sits behind glasses with pencil in are here and as

2552
02:45:37.661 --> 02:45:39.850
quick to find answers to my questions.

2553
02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:45.720
My homeland is a truck driver who smiles down from his cab and signals me

2554
02:45:46.270 --> 02:45:47.470
through the intersection.

2555
02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:53.670
My America is a personal friend and I am proud to serve her

2556
02:45:58.100 --> 02:46:02.140
and you and you go on to say that there must be a thousand definitions for

2557
02:46:02.141 --> 02:46:05.910
freedom.
Mine is simple.

2558
02:46:06.030 --> 02:46:09.290
Freedom is the ability to walk through the door.

2559
02:46:10.430 --> 02:46:13.520
<v 0>It's not the act of walking through.
That's proof of freedom.</v>

2560
02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:19.180
It's not going to church or speaking one's mind or demonstrating in the streets.

2561
02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:23.120
Freedom is the ability to choose whether to go to church.

2562
02:46:23.270 --> 02:46:26.660
To step up on a soap box to carry placards.

2563
02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:32.530
Now that I am released again,
I move about it.

2564
02:46:32.531 --> 02:46:37.531
Will I say what I wish I criticize and take criticism?

2565
02:46:39.340 --> 02:46:44.340
I feel freer now than ever before because I know what freedom is.

2566
02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:50.140
I appreciate those freedoms because I was once denied them.

2567
02:46:51.890 --> 02:46:52.723
And is there anything,

2568
02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:56.710
is there anybody that appreciates freedoms more than people that have had those

2569
02:46:56.711 --> 02:46:58.720
freedoms denied?
Probably not.

2570
02:47:00.730 --> 02:47:05.730
Is there any way to transfer the appreciation for those freedoms?

2571
02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:06.980
I mean,
I'm sure

2572
02:47:06.980 --> 02:47:10.000
<v 2>doing my darnedest to you and your darkness and uh,</v>

2573
02:47:10.110 --> 02:47:12.130
you were in the same business.
You know,
I,

2574
02:47:12.131 --> 02:47:14.540
I speak a couple of times a week all over the country have stuff.

2575
02:47:14.541 --> 02:47:17.480
So I came home trying to impress this on people.

2576
02:47:17.481 --> 02:47:22.481
But the truth is there's no way that you or I can't put people in that situation

2577
02:47:24.441 --> 02:47:27.140
that we've been in and make them feel the way they feel.

2578
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:30.650
There's no way I could deny a person a freedom.

2579
02:47:31.230 --> 02:47:36.170
I do corporate workshops,
uh,
as you do.
And,
uh,
and I'll put,

2580
02:47:36.890 --> 02:47:41.870
I'll put a person in her in a room by themselves with nothing there for 15

2581
02:47:41.871 --> 02:47:45.760
minutes and they go crazy.
You know?
Do you take their phone away from them?
Yeah.

2582
02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:51.170
You can cut that down to five.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah.
They're going nice.

2583
02:47:51.230 --> 02:47:54.680
And so,
uh,
there's very little,

2584
02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:56.420
well I should say it this way,

2585
02:47:56.470 --> 02:48:01.470
it's difficult to make that transfer to make a person to appreciate freedom when

2586
02:48:01.581 --> 02:48:04.580
they've never lost theirs.
And all I can do is tell them

2587
02:48:04.590 --> 02:48:05.430
<v 0>the story.
Yeah.</v>

2588
02:48:06.630 --> 02:48:11.310
And I appreciate your helping me tell the story I'm trying over here.

2589
02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:14.310
I'm going to,
you know,

2590
02:48:14.311 --> 02:48:18.180
occasionally I just have to go that a little bit of the distance on some stuff

2591
02:48:18.181 --> 02:48:21.120
that have to read in here.
This is one of those situations to,

2592
02:48:21.410 --> 02:48:25.650
to wrap up because I think this is just a such an important message for me.

2593
02:48:25.651 --> 02:48:30.390
For everybody.
Back to the book,
I'm often asked,
how did you do it,

2594
02:48:30.391 --> 02:48:34.710
commander?
How could you take six years of filth,

2595
02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:38.820
brutality and loneliness?
I could have never done it.

2596
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:40.520
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2597
02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:42.620
<v 0>My answer is,
of course you could.</v>

2598
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:48.110
As a matter of fact that you rub elbows each day with people who have done it.

2599
02:48:49.430 --> 02:48:51.170
We weren't the only prisoners.

2600
02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:56.320
Millions of Americans have experienced the manacles of the body or shackles of

2601
02:48:56.421 --> 02:48:57.254
the mind.

2602
02:48:58.190 --> 02:49:01.820
They have been bound by unfortunate external circumstances,

2603
02:49:01.970 --> 02:49:05.780
automobile accidents,
disease,
natural disaster,

2604
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:08.760
paralyzing grief from the loss of a loved one.

2605
02:49:09.930 --> 02:49:13.440
They've suffered deprivation and humiliation

2606
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:17.720
once a victim of misfortune,

2607
02:49:17.870 --> 02:49:22.790
many become too insecure to open doors.
Instead,

2608
02:49:22.791 --> 02:49:26.720
they allow themselves to wallow in despair.
They become alcoholics.

2609
02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:31.310
Drug addicts on faithful wives or husbands,
unruly children

2610
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:37.580
in ability to face personal responsibility is often hidden and seemingly

2611
02:49:37.610 --> 02:49:42.020
innocent.
Pastimes,
golf,
poker,
television,

2612
02:49:42.110 --> 02:49:42.943
sleep.

2613
02:49:43.870 --> 02:49:44.440
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2614
02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:48.910
<v 0>These diversions spawn intense feeling of guilt and worthlessness</v>

2615
02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:55.680
and some victims ultimately isolate themselves and become despondent.

2616
02:49:58.000 --> 02:49:58.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2617
02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:00.440
<v 0>A few commit suicide.</v>

2618
02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:07.600
I had ample opportunity to damn society and curse my fate.

2619
02:50:09.610 --> 02:50:10.250
<v 4>Okay,</v>

2620
02:50:10.250 --> 02:50:12.470
<v 0>but what good would that have done</v>

2621
02:50:14.090 --> 02:50:18.710
to be sure that Vietnamese would not have released me simply because I felt

2622
02:50:18.711 --> 02:50:19.970
sorry for myself.

2623
02:50:20.930 --> 02:50:21.270
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2624
02:50:21.270 --> 02:50:22.230
<v 0>On the contrary,</v>

2625
02:50:22.380 --> 02:50:26.280
they used to every available means to make that happen.

2626
02:50:28.270 --> 02:50:33.250
A despondent prisoner was a prime candidate for communist indoctrination.

2627
02:50:35.570 --> 02:50:40.570
My secret for enduring six years of hell is really not a secret at all.

2628
02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:43.730
First and foremost,

2629
02:50:43.731 --> 02:50:48.731
if I had faith in God knowing that his will would be done,

2630
02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:52.280
I never doubted that I could persevere.

2631
02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:55.790
I simply trusted God's promise to answer my prayers.

2632
02:50:57.020 --> 02:51:00.560
I also loved my country,
its people,
and its freedoms.

2633
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:05.600
I realized that because of the human element,
mistakes could be made,

2634
02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:08.310
but in growing up,

2635
02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:12.400
I had discerned that most of the people in this great land or on a very

2636
02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:16.860
honorable and compassionate
second,

2637
02:51:17.130 --> 02:51:18.800
I had self-discipline.

2638
02:51:19.630 --> 02:51:23.910
It would have been easier to avoid church torture by succumbing to north

2639
02:51:23.911 --> 02:51:25.320
Vietnamese interrogation.

2640
02:51:26.190 --> 02:51:31.170
It would've been easier to assume helplessness.
By blaming an evil world,

2641
02:51:32.250 --> 02:51:37.250
I could have rationalized myself into mental and physical paralysis.

2642
02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:40.073
However,

2643
02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:44.940
strict self obedience gave me the ability to persevere.

2644
02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:49.480
Finally,
I had pride.

2645
02:51:50.410 --> 02:51:53.500
I was proud to know and omnipotent God.

2646
02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:59.430
I was proud of my country and its heritage.
I was proud of my family.

2647
02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:03.930
I was proud of myself.
Faith,

2648
02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:05.860
disciplined,
pride.

2649
02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:11.800
Each of these nurture the others combined.

2650
02:52:13.090 --> 02:52:14.620
They allowed me to endure.

2651
02:52:16.890 --> 02:52:21.870
I have joined the ranks of millions of Americans who've applied heroic

2652
02:52:21.871 --> 02:52:24.330
principles in overcoming hardships.

2653
02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:25.450
<v 4>Okay?</v>

2654
02:52:25.450 --> 02:52:30.340
<v 0>Every day a disabled veteran steps away from his wheelchair everyday.</v>

2655
02:52:30.460 --> 02:52:33.600
Uh,
life is resumed after a death in the family.

2656
02:52:34.740 --> 02:52:37.020
Friendships erase,
loneliness.

2657
02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:43.100
Addicts throwaway the crutch of alcohol or drugs or obsessions.

2658
02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:48.180
Every day someone discovers how to love life,

2659
02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:51.160
no matter what the obstacle,

2660
02:52:52.930 --> 02:52:57.170
every day someone sees the light at the end of the tunnel,

2661
02:52:59.610 --> 02:53:03.450
these ordinary Americans are not held in esteem as heroes,

2662
02:53:03.810 --> 02:53:08.810
yet they have suffered grave misfortune and have recovered just as I.

2663
02:53:12.340 --> 02:53:16.120
So you see,
I'm no hero.

2664
02:53:22.650 --> 02:53:25.680
And I think it's that very humility,
sir,

2665
02:53:25.681 --> 02:53:30.681
that makes you a hero because you are certainly a hero to me and certainly a

2666
02:53:31.171 --> 02:53:33.990
hero to this great nation.

2667
02:53:35.310 --> 02:53:36.660
<v 2>Well,
thank you.
Thank you for that.</v>

2668
02:53:38.520 --> 02:53:41.710
And I am so those bouquets right back at you.

2669
02:53:42.170 --> 02:53:43.530
You're one of my heroes.

2670
02:53:47.310 --> 02:53:51.660
<v 0>I don't accept sir.
Not at all.
Um,</v>

2671
02:53:52.940 --> 02:53:55.860
you know,
as you look at other people's struggle

2672
02:53:57.450 --> 02:54:01.170
with all the things that you mentioned,
the drugs,
the alcohol,
the obsession,

2673
02:54:01.171 --> 02:54:03.000
depression after the loss of a loved one,

2674
02:54:05.550 --> 02:54:09.360
how can people find the faith,

2675
02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:15.270
the discipline and the pride that you talk about?

2676
02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:18.540
What do you think is that colonel,

2677
02:54:18.541 --> 02:54:23.541
that starting point that allows those things to grow in someone's mind so that

2678
02:54:23.731 --> 02:54:26.640
they can overcome these kinds of challenge?

2679
02:54:28.570 --> 02:54:33.570
<v 2>I think the first seed that you have to plant in nurture in your mind is that</v>

2680
02:54:34.541 --> 02:54:39.160
you still have the choice that you still are in control.

2681
02:54:39.850 --> 02:54:44.140
Because I think so many people that get bogged down with these challenges we're

2682
02:54:44.141 --> 02:54:47.340
talking about assume that there's no way out that,

2683
02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:52.380
that it's somebody else's problem or somebody else has to affect their lives and

2684
02:54:53.351 --> 02:54:55.840
they feel like they have no control over the,
over the outcome.

2685
02:54:56.500 --> 02:55:00.070
And so I think that's the beginning part of it is that,
um,

2686
02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:05.600
each of us makes decisions every day that control our destiny.

2687
02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:10.720
And it truly is not the things around us.
It's,
it's our,
it's our,

2688
02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:13.400
our approach to the things around us.

2689
02:55:13.401 --> 02:55:15.440
It's our definition of the things around us.

2690
02:55:15.441 --> 02:55:20.441
It's our willingness to accept a challenge and make choices about the things

2691
02:55:21.861 --> 02:55:26.690
around us.
And so if he can,
if you can nurture that,
if you can believe that,

2692
02:55:26.691 --> 02:55:29.690
yes,
I have control of my life,
I am,

2693
02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:32.090
I am the master of my fate.

2694
02:55:33.470 --> 02:55:37.580
I'm the captain of my soul.
Um,
and if you can really believe that,

2695
02:55:38.090 --> 02:55:42.650
then the rest is just a matter of the discipline it takes to work through it.

2696
02:55:43.890 --> 02:55:45.690
<v 3>You know,
it's an interesting,
I was talking to,
you know,</v>

2697
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:49.880
I was talking to your son Alex,
and we were talking about how,
you know,

2698
02:55:49.881 --> 02:55:54.440
as he was growing up and he was hearing your sort of philosophy of life and the

2699
02:55:54.441 --> 02:55:59.330
world,
and,
and when he heard me on,
on a podcast and he started saying,

2700
02:55:59.331 --> 02:56:02.560
wait a second,
I've heard,
I've heard this kind of stuff.
And,
and,

2701
02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:04.730
and we were talking about how,
you know,
I've,

2702
02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:08.390
I've Kinda said that now that you know,
there's some,

2703
02:56:09.260 --> 02:56:12.950
I hate to go so far as to say universal truths,

2704
02:56:12.951 --> 02:56:17.951
but there's certainly some things in human nature and human life that are very

2705
02:56:18.111 --> 02:56:21.950
similar across the board.
And when you take people and you put them through this,

2706
02:56:22.130 --> 02:56:22.910
this,

2707
02:56:22.910 --> 02:56:27.910
this crazy thing of life and you provide them with some similar challenges,

2708
02:56:28.161 --> 02:56:30.920
they're going to come to very similar conclusions.
And,

2709
02:56:31.020 --> 02:56:33.860
and from what you just said,
you know,

2710
02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:37.430
there's two things that you said that I say all the time and number one,

2711
02:56:37.431 --> 02:56:41.840
this perspective of,
you know,
what's that initial spark to say,
Hey,

2712
02:56:41.841 --> 02:56:43.330
I can take discipline,
I can take pride.

2713
02:56:43.370 --> 02:56:45.710
The first thing in my mind you've got to say is like,
okay,

2714
02:56:45.711 --> 02:56:47.210
these problems that are happening,
I can,

2715
02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:48.770
I got to take ownership of what I can do.

2716
02:56:48.771 --> 02:56:51.380
I'm going to take ownership on my problems.
I can't blame this guy.

2717
02:56:51.381 --> 02:56:54.770
Can't play Mac guy.
I got to take ownership too of them.

2718
02:56:55.250 --> 02:56:56.960
And that's the first thing.

2719
02:56:56.961 --> 02:57:00.680
And then the other piece that you said that I say all the time is you've got

2720
02:57:00.681 --> 02:57:04.340
decisions to make.
You've got little decisions to make,

2721
02:57:04.730 --> 02:57:06.770
and if you can make that right decision,

2722
02:57:07.130 --> 02:57:10.340
if you can do the right thing at that moment in time,

2723
02:57:10.850 --> 02:57:13.490
it's not going to change your life.
That one decision won't change your life.

2724
02:57:13.491 --> 02:57:17.030
But then you're going to three minutes later,
30 seconds later,
an hour later,

2725
02:57:17.031 --> 02:57:18.140
kind of make another decision.

2726
02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:21.800
And can you hold the line and get yourself pointed in the right direction and

2727
02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:23.510
can you have the discipline to do that?

2728
02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:26.240
Can you have the faith in yourself that you're going to make that happen?

2729
02:57:26.690 --> 02:57:28.130
And can you have the pride?

2730
02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:32.040
And you know a Dick Winters talked about that too on Los Po last podcast.

2731
02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:35.300
You know,
Dick winters from the first of five or six band of brothers.

2732
02:57:35.930 --> 02:57:40.730
But one of the big things that he was concerned about with his men was if the,

2733
02:57:40.731 --> 02:57:45.290
if he still saw them begin to lose pride and how a,

2734
02:57:45.291 --> 02:57:47.450
if I don't care what echo thanks to me,
if I come in here,

2735
02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:49.790
I'm not ready for this podcast,
and he's going to look at me like,
oh,

2736
02:57:49.791 --> 02:57:52.460
I guess chocolate was just letting it slide and all of a sudden if I don't care

2737
02:57:52.461 --> 02:57:55.280
anymore,
I don't care anymore.
Now I'm not preparing.
Now I'm not getting ready.

2738
02:57:55.700 --> 02:57:59.210
And then you take someone in combat and they start to lose pride and all of a

2739
02:57:59.211 --> 02:58:02.040
sudden they say,
I don't care who sees me acting

2740
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:04.920
<v 6>the wrong way.
Who sees me slacking off on a watch,</v>

2741
02:58:04.921 --> 02:58:07.920
who sees me not cleaning my weapon if I don't care about that anymore.

2742
02:58:08.250 --> 02:58:11.460
That's the beginning of that downward spiral.
And Pride is one of those

2743
02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:17.160
things that you have to be careful of because just like any other dichotomy that

2744
02:58:17.161 --> 02:58:18.660
we have as human beings,
yes,

2745
02:58:18.661 --> 02:58:22.650
you can get so much pride that you no longer think you can do anything wrong,

2746
02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:25.350
which we know where that leads.
That's right.

2747
02:58:25.950 --> 02:58:30.480
And you can have not enough pride to keep yourself on the right path.

2748
02:58:31.510 --> 02:58:33.660
Great.
Amazing stuff.
Uh,

2749
02:58:36.730 --> 02:58:37.563
<v 1>yeah.</v>

2750
02:58:38.330 --> 02:58:43.270
<v 6>Echo.
Did you have any questions?
Just wondering.
Well,</v>

2751
02:58:44.020 --> 02:58:47.540
this is one part I kind of want it to reflect on that I thought was pretty

2752
02:58:47.541 --> 02:58:52.430
important.
Even on a smaller,
he liked the part where you were regarding the,

2753
02:58:52.460 --> 02:58:56.340
um,
the guards as in their own prison,
you know,

2754
02:58:56.390 --> 02:58:59.480
so you almost like he said that they had it worse than you did.

2755
02:59:00.170 --> 02:59:04.580
So this one time my wife told me this story where she was in the checkout line

2756
02:59:05.150 --> 02:59:08.660
in the store.
A lot of stuff happens in the checkout line.

2757
02:59:08.661 --> 02:59:11.960
A lot of things happen when the grocery store with lot of lessons,

2758
02:59:11.961 --> 02:59:15.620
a lot of lessons.
So she was,
she found herself in the express line,

2759
02:59:15.621 --> 02:59:20.240
but she had more than the 15 items.
And the guy behind her started,

2760
02:59:20.241 --> 02:59:23.540
he was tripping the whole time though.
So she's paying,

2761
02:59:23.541 --> 02:59:25.990
she's trying to hurry up and he's like,
you,
you know,
you know,

2762
02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:31.630
what do you call loud talking like talking to the person next to him about my

2763
02:59:32.481 --> 02:59:37.100
life.
So after the whole ordeal,
it was kind of like a scene,
you know.

2764
02:59:37.220 --> 02:59:41.720
So my wife afterwards just like,
oh I hope you have a nice day.
You know,
like I,

2765
02:59:41.840 --> 02:59:45.830
you know,
she left.
Did she say it earnestly?
Yeah,

2766
02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:50.950
that didn't sound real earnest and I don't think that she probably,

2767
02:59:51.230 --> 02:59:54.230
yeah,
she was probably self d for sure.
But at the end of the day,

2768
02:59:54.231 --> 02:59:56.320
it's kind of like a,
I hope you have a nice day and shit.

2769
02:59:56.330 --> 02:59:57.770
So she told me that story and she was like,

2770
02:59:57.771 --> 03:00:01.460
but you know what a big part of me was like,
he has to go home with himself,

2771
03:00:01.580 --> 03:00:05.390
you know,
and I get to come home and be cool and have all my girl,
you know,

2772
03:00:05.391 --> 03:00:07.550
all this stuff.
I was like,
Dang,
that's a good way to look at it.

2773
03:00:07.551 --> 03:00:11.180
Cause he has to go home.
He's probably pissed.
Yeah.
For the day.
And you know,

2774
03:00:11.240 --> 03:00:13.580
she gets to go home with 17 grocery items to

2775
03:00:15.100 --> 03:00:19.760
reason through the checkout line.
It's true.
Um,
oh yeah.

2776
03:00:19.761 --> 03:00:22.280
One question.
You know,
when you got arrested,
when you bought that scooter,

2777
03:00:22.670 --> 03:00:26.570
the Christian figured about this because I've been in this experience because

2778
03:00:26.571 --> 03:00:29.030
you get the scooter ray,
you pack your friend.
Yeah.
Right.

2779
03:00:29.060 --> 03:00:31.490
And then the top say stop you.
That happened to us all the time.

2780
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:34.580
But why did they arrest you though is,
I mean,
is it like,
hey,

2781
03:00:34.581 --> 03:00:38.660
you guys can't do that.
You're going to jail.
Uh,
well I,

2782
03:00:38.661 --> 03:00:42.290
it was rather unusual I think for these,
these cops to see these two little guys.

2783
03:00:42.550 --> 03:00:47.240
You know,
we were 13 and 14 years old and then we weren't very big to begin with.

2784
03:00:47.241 --> 03:00:50.270
And then the motor scooter was bigger than we were and it's in the middle of the

2785
03:00:50.271 --> 03:00:54.650
night and were,
I think they,
they felt,

2786
03:00:55.310 --> 03:00:58.730
they felt like there was something suspicious.
Took it.
He's stolen.

2787
03:01:01.450 --> 03:01:05.320
Well,
uh,
all right.
Echo what sir?
Do you have anything else on that,

2788
03:01:05.350 --> 03:01:08.500
on that right there?
Nope.
Okay.
Uh,
no,
no,
no,

2789
03:01:08.501 --> 03:01:12.520
no further details on the scooter rides.
We got that clear.

2790
03:01:13.230 --> 03:01:17.310
We'll drop that echo.
Um,

2791
03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:23.110
you know,
do you think that you could maybe
tell us how to support the podcast?

2792
03:01:23.130 --> 03:01:25.390
Sure.
What to work.
Of course they can't.
That's what I'm here for.

2793
03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:27.430
One of the many reasons.
So,
um,

2794
03:01:29.260 --> 03:01:31.480
if you want to support this podcast many ways,

2795
03:01:31.580 --> 03:01:36.400
first way you can support yourself.
I,
I said it before,

2796
03:01:36.401 --> 03:01:40.090
I'm gonna say it again on it.
Supplements,
right?
You're doing physical stuff,

2797
03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:43.630
supplements that gets you through.
I'm not gonna spend too much time on it.

2798
03:01:43.631 --> 03:01:44.740
I want to,
I won't.

2799
03:01:46.210 --> 03:01:49.600
I'm going to recommend the Krill oil and the strong boom.
That's it.

2800
03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:54.500
See now just sir,
I'm not letting this annoy me.
I'm just going to go,

2801
03:01:54.501 --> 03:01:58.030
I'm just like,
okay with it.
It's my problem.
I don't want to listen to him talk.

2802
03:01:58.031 --> 03:02:02.950
That's my problem.
He has the right to speak for a long hours about this stuff.

2803
03:02:03.650 --> 03:02:06.550
Here's the thing.
They'll part,
like,
let's say you were to get annoyed.

2804
03:02:06.551 --> 03:02:09.820
The only reason you'd be annoyed they get annoyed is because you know this
stuff.

2805
03:02:10.330 --> 03:02:11.230
Some people they don't know.

2806
03:02:11.290 --> 03:02:13.660
There's all those people that maybe they want to hear it again on your every

2807
03:02:13.661 --> 03:02:15.460
word.
But the good thing about on it,

2808
03:02:15.461 --> 03:02:18.700
you know that's a good stuff cause supplements can be kind of junk sometimes,

2809
03:02:19.090 --> 03:02:21.370
but this is the 100% these,

2810
03:02:21.390 --> 03:02:24.970
this is the good stuff and their stuff for everything in life,
everything.

2811
03:02:25.210 --> 03:02:28.440
We only talk about the Krill oil,
some other stuff,

2812
03:02:28.441 --> 03:02:32.370
but you go on their protein wellness to even like digest it.

2813
03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:35.580
Everything they got on there on it.com that's where you get it.

2814
03:02:35.610 --> 03:02:38.490
If you want 10% off on it.com/jocko

2815
03:02:40.850 --> 03:02:44.990
another way before you do your Amazon shopping,
clickthrough Jocko,

2816
03:02:44.991 --> 03:02:48.320
podcast.com to do your Amazon shopping and then uh,
you know,

2817
03:02:48.350 --> 03:02:51.560
do your shopping is the,
is normal.
It's a good way to support small action.

2818
03:02:51.561 --> 03:02:54.680
Big reaction takes what,
three seconds?
Something like that.

2819
03:02:56.270 --> 03:02:59.780
Maybe for,
I don't know,
either way.
Do that.
That's a good way.

2820
03:02:59.810 --> 03:03:04.340
Also subscribed to the podcast if you haven't already.
That's iTunes,
stitcher,

2821
03:03:04.370 --> 03:03:08.830
Google play and other podcasting
platforms.

2822
03:03:09.490 --> 03:03:14.410
Subscribe on Youtube.
I put some excerpts on some more.
Last one.

2823
03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:17.080
That was a good one.
Good one,
12 minutes.
You're just so,
you know,

2824
03:03:17.081 --> 03:03:21.310
you're getting outside the boundaries of an excerpt.
Man.
I'm listening to it.

2825
03:03:21.311 --> 03:03:24.190
I'm like,
we don't want to our exercise right there,
but I'm like,
oh wait,
wait.

2826
03:03:24.191 --> 03:03:28.750
That kind of helped it,
you know?
Uh,
what was it?
It was a good one.

2827
03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:32.560
It's 12 minutes long.
Emotion.
Oh,
hangry.
Getting hangry.
Controlling.

2828
03:03:32.561 --> 03:03:37.020
You're stifling your emotions.
Emotions,
your emotions.
Yes,
exactly right.

2829
03:03:37.090 --> 03:03:40.930
When it's level two or lower on the Richter scale of emotions,

2830
03:03:40.931 --> 03:03:45.520
you can't behavior your emotions,
but your behavior can be based on anyway,

2831
03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:50.830
look at that little excerpt.
Uh,
put more on,

2832

2834
03:03:58.970 --> 03:04:03.110
Anyone who knows what youtube is.
Getting to know this.
I think I know a little,

2835
03:04:03.730 --> 03:04:06.710
but I didn't quite put all that together.
It's all good.

Um,

Jack was a store,

2838
03:04:14.930 --> 03:04:17.840

Jocko store.com.

2839
03:04:17.841 --> 03:04:20.750
There's some good stuff on their t shirts.
If you like t shirts,

2840
03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:22.850
we wear tee shirts,
right?
I know.

2841
03:04:22.851 --> 03:04:27.790
I do some women's stuff on their shirts.
Patches,

2842
03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:29.360
rash guards,
hoodies,

2843
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:34.340
new rash guard out maybe.
Maybe,
maybe not.

2844
03:04:34.341 --> 03:04:36.530
You got to look Jocko stored out.
Come get some good stuff.

2845
03:04:36.860 --> 03:04:39.920
We got some kids stuff to him there.
Yeah,

You're,

2846
03:04:39.921 --> 03:04:41.120
you're wearing one of those more.

2847
03:04:41.121 --> 03:04:46.121
Your kids does stuff if you're on youtube bug or hitting me up for warrior kid

2848
03:04:47.330 --> 03:04:49.220
tee shirts and,

2849
03:04:49.460 --> 03:04:54.170
and then immediately people said we want them for adults too.

2850
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:57.160
So we made some for kids but then adults said we want them.

2851
03:04:57.280 --> 03:05:01.640
So now we've got warrior kids cause can you be a 45 year old warrior kid?

2852
03:05:01.820 --> 03:05:05.900
I think I am.
Yes sir.
I'm in the game as a warrior kid.
Yeah.

2853
03:05:05.960 --> 03:05:06.830
And if you didn't,

2854
03:05:06.831 --> 03:05:10.100
I mean you're going to obviously talk about the work where the word could book,

2855
03:05:10.101 --> 03:05:13.850
but man,
when you read that book you're like Dang,
I wish I would have read this.

2856
03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:17.300
Whether it be when I'm a kid,
I wish I would've read it one day before her.

2857
03:05:17.301 --> 03:05:18.140
Read it that day.

2858
03:05:18.360 --> 03:05:20.720
It's like that's how much you wish you would've known all this stuff.

2859
03:05:20.721 --> 03:05:25.280
Cause it's real basic,
but it's so deep,
man.
I'll go.
Jake's got some info.
Layers,

2860
03:05:25.281 --> 03:05:26.870
man.
Layers upon layers.

2861
03:05:27.260 --> 03:05:30.320
There's people now identifying layers on Twitter by the way,
which is a pre,

2862
03:05:30.600 --> 03:05:33.980
there's been some really good identification of layers.

2863
03:05:34.010 --> 03:05:37.040
There's some layers in that book.
Yeah,
they're going to get deeper too.

2864
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:40.310
That's good.
So yeah,
you know.
Yeah.
Back to the store.

2865
03:05:40.340 --> 03:05:42.440
[inaudible] dot com you can see what's on there.

2866
03:05:42.441 --> 03:05:46.980
This is cool stuff and if you want to support,
get something,
you know,

2867
03:05:47.200 --> 03:05:49.550
also psychological warfare.
If you didn't know what that is,

2868
03:05:49.551 --> 03:05:52.970
which I know you already do,
but in a small event that you don't,

2869
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:58.030
it is an album on iTunes with tracks and Amazon music with tracks,

2870
03:06:00.920 --> 03:06:04.310
not music tracks,
spoken word checks.

2871
03:06:04.311 --> 03:06:08.320
Technically it's what's called spoken word number one,
by the way.
Yeah,

2872
03:06:08.460 --> 03:06:11.910
still still number one days that,

2873
03:06:11.930 --> 03:06:13.480
I mean for good reason because look,

2874
03:06:13.850 --> 03:06:15.860
he can put together a psychological warfare too,

2875
03:06:15.890 --> 03:06:19.760
and I've got some really good suggestions from everyone on things that need,

2876
03:06:19.761 --> 03:06:21.830
where we need help as a group.

2877
03:06:21.831 --> 03:06:26.831
So if you've got those hit hit us up on Twitter to give suggestions for

2878
03:06:27.290 --> 03:06:30.920
psychological warfare.
Two tracks.
Yeah.

2879
03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:36.000
What you need areas where we need help.
We all need help.
Yeah.
I got some,
some,

2880
03:06:36.300 --> 03:06:40.400
some uh,
request me 47 requests.
Yeah,

2881
03:06:40.401 --> 03:06:44.240
they're all my personal ones.
I think I got 48 now.
But yeah,

2882
03:06:44.241 --> 03:06:47.320
if you didn't know what that is,
it's like,
it's an album.
You get it.
You have a,

2883
03:06:47.340 --> 03:06:50.300
you know,
in your journey of what getting after it in,

2884
03:06:50.301 --> 03:06:54.200
you're getting after it journey,
but you're not strong the whole time.

2885
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:56.820
You're just not,
yeah moments.
And most of us aren't.

2886
03:06:56.970 --> 03:06:58.920
You're going gonna have moments of weakness.
But guess what?

2887
03:06:59.280 --> 03:07:03.060
In those moments of weakness,
you listened to the designated track.

2888
03:07:03.570 --> 03:07:06.570
If you're having a weak moment of weakness when you're trying to wake up at four

2889
03:07:06.571 --> 03:07:10.110
30,
come on,
Bro.
That's,
that's early four 30.
Every day.
Yeah.

2890
03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:14.220
The day is probably going to come where you're like,
you know what,

2891
03:07:14.221 --> 03:07:15.300
I'm gonna hit this news.
Guess what?

2892
03:07:15.330 --> 03:07:19.080
Listen to get up and get affricate up and get after it.

2893
03:07:19.081 --> 03:07:22.170
There's like two or three of those two and I guarantee you won't hit the snooze.

2894
03:07:22.200 --> 03:07:24.800
You'll get up,
you'll get after it.
Anyway,
that's,

2895
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:27.990
that's what I think with 100% certainty.
Anyway.
Again,

2896
03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:29.190
it's called psychological warfare.

2897
03:07:29.220 --> 03:07:33.680
It's on iTunes and Amazon music and some other places where you buy into some of

2898
03:07:33.681 --> 03:07:38.460
the music.
They're all,
all,
all a button in there.
Yeah.
Good.

2899
03:07:38.520 --> 03:07:40.110
And also by the way,

2900
03:07:40.380 --> 03:07:43.710
the book that we reviewed today with Captain Plumb,

2901
03:07:44.460 --> 03:07:49.460
it's available on Charlie plumb.com c h a r l I e P L U M b.com.

2902
03:07:54.270 --> 03:07:57.600
That's where you can get it.
It's called I'm no hero.
That's right.
And

2903
03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:02.490
also you can get some Jocko white tea on there.

2904
03:08:02.940 --> 03:08:05.970
If you need to drink liquid in your life,

2905
03:08:06.060 --> 03:08:09.600
you might as well drink a liquid that's going to make you smarter,
stronger,

2906
03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:12.540
faster,
and a more dynamic human being.

2907
03:08:12.670 --> 03:08:16.350
There was only one drink that does that and that's Jocko white tea.
By the way,

2908
03:08:16.351 --> 03:08:18.180
it's 147% double blind,

2909
03:08:18.181 --> 03:08:22.620
placebo approved and true and tested in a laboratory with people wearing white

2910
03:08:22.740 --> 03:08:27.740
outfits so you know or good to go weigh the warrior kid and this is the book

2911
03:08:29.191 --> 03:08:33.990
right there that's going to hit your kids from another angle and it is going to

2912
03:08:33.991 --> 03:08:38.010
get them to understand some things like hard work,
discipline,

2913
03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:43.290
honor,
physical training,
mental training,
studying.

2914
03:08:43.860 --> 03:08:46.470
No one thinks Jocko was going to write a book of teaching me how to study.

2915
03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:50.010
They didn't think that did that go tell me the truth.
They didn't think that.
No,

2916
03:08:50.070 --> 03:08:54.840
they didn't see my college grades.
So you learn how to study,

2917
03:08:54.841 --> 03:08:59.010
learn how to get stronger in the book where the Warrior kid get it for your kids

2918
03:08:59.370 --> 03:09:00.031
and you know what?

2919
03:09:00.031 --> 03:09:03.240
You're going to read it first and then you're going to get a copy for yourself

2920
03:09:03.241 --> 03:09:07.140
where the warrior kid get that.
Can I say something about one say apart?
Yeah,

2921
03:09:07.141 --> 03:09:11.780
sure.
We have another four hours of space on the recorder so let's do it.

2922
03:09:12.150 --> 03:09:15.810
There is a part when he sees small progress,

2923
03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:19.830
I think it was after one pull up and he's like,
yeah,
oh yeah,

2924
03:09:19.950 --> 03:09:24.630
fired up the part when he said he scolded him small,

2925
03:09:24.660 --> 03:09:29.070
mild scolding for celebrating too early or too much too early.
Jake says,
Hey,

2926
03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:33.030
take it easy,
they're good.
And,
but then he said,
no,
come over here.

2927
03:09:33.031 --> 03:09:35.790
Give me a high five and get back to work.

2928
03:09:35.830 --> 03:09:38.460
When you let them sell them in a little bit.
That was good man.

2929
03:09:39.390 --> 03:09:42.990
Jake is a good man.
It's good man.
He puts it out to it,
right?

2956
03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:39.910
just a social media junkie is what I'm hearing my kids keep me honest.

2957
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:43.660
And,

2958

2960

Thank you so much then.
Surely and honor.

2970
03:12:32.140 --> 03:12:36.250
And Sir,
do you have anything,
any other closing thoughts you want to add?

2971
03:12:36.820 --> 03:12:39.610
Well I want to tell you about the rest of the story.

2972
03:12:40.310 --> 03:12:45.310
It says people might be interested in knowing that my ex wife married the guy

2973
03:12:45.311 --> 03:12:50.311
she was engaged to and there they'd been living happily for the last 43 years.

2974
03:12:51.740 --> 03:12:51.980
I

2975
03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:56.330
<v 2>remarried a wonderful lady.
Yeah,
four kids,
two grandkids.
And one on the way.</v>

2976
03:12:57.350 --> 03:13:00.800
My daughter is married to a marine and they're pregnant with her first child

2977
03:13:00.801 --> 03:13:03.890
should be doing in fact any day now.
Semper fi,
my daughter,

2978
03:13:04.060 --> 03:13:08.690
I have a wonderful wife that supports me and the puts up with me.

2979
03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:13.610
Uh,
and uh,
and,
and,
and I'm,
I'm living the dream.
I really am.

2980
03:13:13.611 --> 03:13:16.820
I don't know how I could be happier in my life.

2981
03:13:16.821 --> 03:13:21.821
I could not write a story that would bring more fulfillment to me personally

2982
03:13:22.881 --> 03:13:27.560
then why already live?
I still fly airplanes.
I have two airplanes.

2983
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:32.270
I have a home in a hanger as well.
My man cave.
And,
uh,

2984
03:13:32.290 --> 03:13:33.140
it's just,
uh,
it's,

2985
03:13:33.141 --> 03:13:38.141
it's a delight to be alive and I appreciate you for helping me tell my story

2986
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:42.290
because,
uh,
I believe it's an important story now.

2987
03:13:42.650 --> 03:13:46.220
Not Everybody is going to be a prisoner of war.
In fact,
I hope,

2988
03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:51.080
I hope and pray none of the people listening to this podcast will ever be in

2989
03:13:51.081 --> 03:13:53.450
that eight foot cell that I was in.

2990
03:13:53.451 --> 03:13:57.350
But we all get into our own little prisons and,
and we can be,

2991
03:13:57.370 --> 03:14:02.370
I am convinced justice confined in our little eight inch box is I was in an

2992
03:14:02.931 --> 03:14:06.760
eight foot prison cell.
And so if,

2993
03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:11.510
if those challenges are the same,
then the solution is the same,

2994
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:16.370
uh,
the solution to the prisons that we find ourselves in.
You know,

2995
03:14:16.400 --> 03:14:21.210
the self discipline that it takes,
the believing that yes,
I am in control of my,

2996
03:14:21.650 --> 03:14:22.640
my own life.

2997
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:26.930
I am a captain of my soul and uh,

2998
03:14:27.290 --> 03:14:29.750
and that I do and I do make a difference.

2999
03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:33.810
So he put all those things together and um,
and you,

3000
03:14:33.870 --> 03:14:37.640
you can in fact live the life with the hand that you're dealt.

3001
03:14:40.540 --> 03:14:45.540
<v 0>I won't even try and make any additional points on that other than to say when</v>

3002
03:14:46.871 --> 03:14:51.871
you have a hangar with two planes in it for your man cave you when the man cave

3003
03:14:52.151 --> 03:14:55.960
contest.
Absolutely.
That's unbelievable.

3004
03:14:56.290 --> 03:14:58.180
And Sir,
obviously I,

3005
03:14:58.950 --> 03:15:03.520
I can't thank you enough for coming on the podcast for writing the book,

3006
03:15:03.580 --> 03:15:08.580
for sharing the knowledge that you paid so dearly to acquire and more important

3007
03:15:13.781 --> 03:15:14.381
than all of that.

3008
03:15:14.381 --> 03:15:19.150
I can't thank you enough for your service and your sacrifice

3009
03:15:20.710 --> 03:15:21.640
for six years

3010
03:15:23.410 --> 03:15:28.060
for us and for this great nation.

3011
03:15:28.660 --> 03:15:33.660
And you dedicate your book very simply

3012
03:15:36.300 --> 03:15:41.300
to the families of those brave men who will never return.

3013
03:15:44.190 --> 03:15:49.060
And for those families
and for those brave,

3014
03:15:51.660 --> 03:15:52.770
we will live.

3015
03:15:54.940 --> 03:15:59.940
And we will try to live as you have exemplified.

3016
03:16:02.570 --> 03:16:03.270
<v 4>Okay.</v>

3017
03:16:03.270 --> 03:16:07.230
<v 0>With faith and pride and discipline</v>

3018
03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:14.680
to overcome whatever hardships we might face and whatever obstacles might be in

3019
03:16:16.461 --> 03:16:17.294
our path.

3020
03:16:19.010 --> 03:16:19.810
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3021
03:16:19.810 --> 03:16:23.460
<v 0>And through those adversities,</v>

3022
03:16:26.290 --> 03:16:29.260
discover every day

3023
03:16:32.660 --> 03:16:34.820
how to love this life.

3024
03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:41.850
So until next time,

3025
03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:47.940
this is captain Charlie plumb
an echo pen.
Jocko.

3026
03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:50.280
Oh.
