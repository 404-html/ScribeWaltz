This is Jocko podcast number 77 with Echo Charles and me,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.410
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.340
And tonight we welcome back to the show retired chief warrant officer Roger

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.990
Hayden.
And if you don't know who Roger Hayden is,

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.020
then just stop right now and go back to episode 37 of this podcast and you can

8
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:34.200
listen to Roger came on for a short period of time.

9
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.020
We got some time constraints on the first time that Roger came on,

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.700
but he's one of the men on which the reputation of the seal teams is built.

11
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.950
Started off as a frogman member of the underwater demolition teams and deployed

12
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:53.451
to Vietnam with underwater demolition team 12 and then came back and checked

13
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:58.611
into seal team one where he deployed again two times to Vietnam and then spent

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.470
30 years in the seal teams and then as a civilian has another how many years?

15
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.670
20 [inaudible].

16
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.850
So we're just looking at a solid 50 years of service to naval special warfare in

17
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:19.170
the seal teams.
So,
like I said,
Roger has been on before.

18
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:23.670
And I'm gonna tell one real quick story to kind of give a little background as

19
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:28.320
to Roger's attitude about things.
And so I was on,

20
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.350
and I told this part of the story last time we were on a ship,
we were,

21
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.150
we were having our,

22
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.040
our operational readiness exercise was being graded.
It's called an orb.

23
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:40.770
And the person that's grading it is Roger Hayden.
So you know,
the,

24
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.630
the young seal platoons were getting graded and making sure that we know what

25
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.890
we're doing.
And at this point,
Roger is a warrant officer,

26
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.730
so he's a commissioned officer and he's out on the ship with us going,
you know,

27
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:57.120
watching how we're planning and seeing how we're preparing our gear and making

28
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.860
sure that we're,
we know what we're doing,
like I said,

29
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.860
and as a commissioned officer,

30
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.550
you're supposed to be eating in what's called the ward room with the rest of the

31
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.120
officers.
So,
you know,

32
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:13.080
the military has officers and they have enlisted guys in the officer's are sort

33
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:16.090
of the managers and the enlisted guys are the workers.
Right.

34
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.480
And as an officer on a ship,
on a navy ship,
you have something called a war room,

35
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:25.350
which is nice.
They have,
it's just a little,
it's not even a little level of,

36
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:29.130
it's pretty darn nice in the wardrobe I've eaten in both the wardroom and on the

37
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:30.570
mess decks and the wardroom,
you know,

38
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:32.640
you have real silverware and is actually people serving you.

39
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.950
So the wardroom is kind of Nice.

40
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.310
Well Roger as a warrant officer is permitted or authorized or supposed to eat

41
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:42.860
with the rest of the officers.
You know,
he's supposed,

42
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.760
supposed to go get that good treatment and Roger didn't want to eat with the

43
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.530
officers.
He wanted to eat with the chief.
So then the middle management of the,

44
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.650
of the navy is the chief,
the chief petty officers,

45
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.380
and there's chief's senior chiefs in master chiefs.

46
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.870
And there are like the backbone of the navy.
They have the,

47
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.250
the tactical knowledge and the seal teams.
And so Roger,

48
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.830
instead of wanting,
instead of eating with the officer's,

49
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.220
he wanted to eat with the chiefs and he,
before he was a warrant officer.

50
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.250
What were you a senior chief before you were warrant officer and masters master

51
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:19.720
chief.
So he was a hardy,
a master chief before he became a warrant officer.

52
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.760
And so he started eating the chief's mess with all the chiefs.
Well,

53
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.680
some of the,
the,
the chiefs on the ship,

54
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.340
they didn't like having officer,
you know,
we don't want this officer in here.

55
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:37.570
This is our territory,
right?
This is our area again,
you know,
we can't,

56
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.070
why is this officer coming in here?

57
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.850
And so my platoon chief at the time was actually friends with,

58
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.160
with Roger,
but you know,
he was the guy that was getting,

59
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.340
had relate building relationships with the chiefs on the ship and all that
stuff.

60
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.560
And so they knew him and they,

61
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.040
and he was a senior chief and they pulled them aside and they said,
hey,
you know,

62
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.150
hey,
senior chief,
you know,
it's kind of,
we've got this warrant officer,

63
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:02.590
he's a CEO.
Why is he coming in?
He's not,

64
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:04.870
shouldn't be coming in here and you need to go to the,
he needs to go to the,
uh,

65
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.560
the,
the wardroom with the rest of the officers.
This is the chief's mess.

66
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:12.730
He doesn't belong in here.
And so my chief was like listening to them.
Oh,
okay.

67
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.800
Well I'm not sure why you feel that way,

68
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.600
but this goes on for a couple of days.
And finally my platoon chief,

69
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:20.470
and I wasn't there for this,

70
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:25.471
but I got told the story and my platoon chief was a guy from the south and he

71
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:30.820
had a great accent and talked in a very distinct manner.
And so,

72
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.810
so they get into lunch,
I think it was launched,
they roll into the,

73
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.360
the chief's mess for luncheon or an officer.

74
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:41.920
Hayden comes in and he's standing in there and he's getting a couple looks from

75
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:46.150
people.
And finally my platoon chief stands up and says,
uh,

76
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.420
can I ask everyone in here a question real quick?

77
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.920
And they go,
okay,
you know what,
what?
And he says,
well,
this here is worn off,

78
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:00.370
Sir Roger Hayden,

79
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.050
member of the underwater demolition teams,

80
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:08.650
member of the seal teams,
served three tours in Vietnam,

81
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.090
highly decorated,
including a purple heart for being wounded.

82
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.690
And he was a master chief before he got commissioned and he wants to eat with us

83
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.770
in the chief's mess.

84
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.580
Does anyone here have a problem with that?

85
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.040
And of course,
no one did nothing but crickets.

86
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.420
And so Roger Hayden eats where Roger Haight and wants to eat.

87
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.920
So Roger,
welcome to the show.
Once again.
Thanks for coming back.

88
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:42.400
I know last time we were time constraint and uh,
you said you'd come back.

89
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:46.150
So here you are.
Appreciated you coming back on.
No,
it's my pleasure.
Thank you.

90
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.220
And,
uh,
like I said,
anybody that wants to get the full background,
you know,

91
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:53.110
listen to that podcast number 37.

92
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.090
And he talks a little bit about how you grew up,

93
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:59.180
but I had a question when you join.
So you came in and your dad was Udt,

94
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.073
which is awesome.

95
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.950
And then when you joined the navy in 1965 did you know you were going to

96
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.190
Vietnam?
Was the war big enough yet?
Because we had this guy on last time,

97
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:14.050
Captain Charlie Plumb,
and he went to the naval academy and he,
he said he,

98
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.470
he graduated from the Naval Academy I think in 1965 as well.

99
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.710
But he said he never heard,

100
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.580
he never heard the word Vietnam one time while he was going to the Naval
Academy.

101
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.270
It wasn't until he graduated that the war escalated and all of a sudden they

102
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.370
realized what he was going through.
Flight Training that yeah,

103
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:35.030
you're going to Vietnam.
But when you joined in 65,
did you know,
I mean,

104
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:37.730
were you thinking,
yeah,
I'm definitely gonna go to Lauren.
Go to Vietnam?
Yeah,

105
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.100
<v 1>pretty much because,
uh,</v>

106
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.480
I'd have been drafted in the army and I knew the army was going to Vietnam,

107
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.770
so I figured,

108
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.690
I knew I wanted to go in the navy and into Udt.

109
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.750
My Dad never talked about it much,
but,
uh,
you know,

110
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:57.751
when I was younger I watched the movies of the Marines attack team beachheads

111
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.880
and getting mowed down,
you know,
rangers taken heavies and stuff.

112
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:07.570
And then I saw the bridge of the river Kwai and the guns of Navarone and I

113
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:09.040
figured,
yeah,
if you're going to fight,

114
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.100
that's the kind of outfit you want to find a sneak around a little bit more.

115
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.290
So yeah,
I did.
I did.
In fact,
it was soon as I got in to the navy,

116
00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:21.700
I,
uh,
I took the screening test and all that stuff.
And you know,

117
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.320
before I even went to,
no,
right after,
when I was at radio one school,

118
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.660
I was a radio one,
so do it.

119
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:33.661
There was a 22 week long school and that's what I did is I worked and did all

120
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:37.770
that stuff and did the screening tests and the,
you know,
and uh,

121
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.990
they wanted me to go to Rhoda or some other navy insulation because they didn't

122
00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:47.530
do too bad and radio one score.
It wasn't the number one guy,
but,
and I went,
no,

123
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:49.360
I'm going to go to Udt and so,

124
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.050
<v 0>and then you went to what?
The u</v>

125
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.850
<v 1>they we,
our class,
our class wasn't starting up for about six months,</v>

126
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.570
so they stuck me on the USS Paul Revere 32nd street waiting for a Udt training

127
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.030
and I was a designated semen back in the day.
A designated semen was pretty good,

128
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.500
wasn't like it is now.

129
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.300
And I figured I'd work in the radio shack or something like that.

130
00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:16.530
We'll soon as they checked the board,

131
00:08:16.531 --> 00:08:20.430
they put me mass cook and I was down in the scullery loan.
We went down there,

132
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.570
there were two other guys that were waiting for a 22 that were in the scullery.

133
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:29.571
So we sat there and did that for six months and got off the ship and went next

134
00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:32.790
door across the bay there to training.

135
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.580
<v 0>Yeah.
That's something that the navy,
it's,
if you're a new guy,</v>

136
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.640
everyone talks about how new guys get treated wherever you are in the military.

137
00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:43.620
But in the navy,
when you,
when you show up to a ship,
you doesn't matter,

138
00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:47.640
you have to work in the,
uh,
in the scullery which is washing dishes.
What is it,

139
00:08:47.641 --> 00:08:50.010
a 90 day stint you got to do in that?
Yeah,
pretty much.
Yeah.

140
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.610
Pretty much 90 days are,

141
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.730
and you only don't do that if you're an e four and above.
Right.

142
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.271
And we did,

143
00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:02.010
I did a deployment where we had a guy that was in ESL but he was an e three and

144
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.660
you know,
he was saying,
Hey,
oh wait,
how am I going to get out of this,
you know,

145
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.390
doing the scullery duty.
And we're like,
you're not,
that's the rules.
You know,

146
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.360
you're going to go do it,

147
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.350
<v 1>do it.
And I was a senior Keith,
two of us,
a guy named real good friend of mine,</v>

148
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.040
we couldn't get her flight back.
So they put us on an Arg,

149
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.630
the float back here to San Diego and we kept Paul over,

150
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.310
guys from the next cook and that were seamen.
That's,

151
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.680
we just went,

152
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.670
we got stuff to do or doing training and they haven't got time to do that.

153
00:09:33.671 --> 00:09:37.330
So we kept him out of,
of course I was a senior chief then and so it was,

154
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.590
so we had little pole plus the Kava,
the boat.
He really liked us a lot.

155
00:09:42.591 --> 00:09:43.700
And uh,
you know,
the,

156
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.960
the CMC and he was a PBR Vietnam guy.

157
00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:49.490
So we get along really well.
Yeah.

158
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:50.921
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,</v>

159
00:09:50.921 --> 00:09:54.010
and actually this kid that ended up making me four luckily before we went on

160
00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:57.760
deployment,
so he's scared out of it.
But,
uh,
I would still do it

161
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.980
<v 1>bringing in the supplies and stuff like that,
you know,</v>

162
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.120
cause it was a good workout.

163
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:07.230
<v 0>Yeah.
I forget what they call that and Reps.
We did that too.
Yeah.</v>

164
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.590
I actually,
when I was on my first deployment,
I deployed to Guam and you know,

165
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.160
we just did whatever you wanted.
I was 21 years old.
It was completely insane.

166
00:10:15.161 --> 00:10:17.750
You got all this per diem money.
You felt like the richest.

167
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.920
You will never mind fell like you were the one just guy you ever met.
I mean you,

168
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.040
you never made any money when you're 1617 years old.

169
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:25.900
Do you get in the seal teams,

170
00:10:25.901 --> 00:10:28.030
you're getting all this money and then they go overseas and they're giving you

171
00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:31.150
per diem.
And so you're the richest dude in the world.

172
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.690
You have very limited responsibilities cause you're a new guy in a seal platoon.

173
00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:35.321
So what do you do?

174
00:10:35.321 --> 00:10:39.820
Just get crazy and get after it and you know,

175
00:10:39.821 --> 00:10:40.750
you're doing whatever you want.

176
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.920
And then my next deployment was on a ship and we pull into the first port and

177
00:10:44.921 --> 00:10:46.210
they say,
uh,
you know,

178
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.070
e four and below liberty expires at 10 o'clock and I was like,

179
00:10:51.071 --> 00:10:53.080
Oh yeah,
whatever.
You know,
I'm a seal.
And they were like,
no,

180
00:10:53.081 --> 00:10:57.310
actually you'll be back on the ship at 10 o'clock and there was no way around
it.

181
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.040
And where there was ways around it,
we found ways,
right.

182
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:01.390
You know what the way around it was,
right.

183
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.950
I'd put my PT gear in a backpack and then go off the ship to go out,

184
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.753
whatever,

185
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.680
and then hang out all night until five o'clock in the morning and I put my PT

186
00:11:14.681 --> 00:11:17.650
gear back on.
I'd run,
get a sweat going to walk up the brow and whatever.

187
00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:21.190
I was coming back and say,
yeah,
I was just out for a run,
got my rock on.

188
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.610
So there was ways,
there's ways to make it happen.

189
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.880
So speaking to guys from,

190
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.330
from when you were going through training,

191
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.890
was there guys,
when you're going through buds training,
was there Korean,

192
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:36.730
Korean vet,

193
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.970
Udt guys in there wasn't a World War II or was it just Vietnam guys have early

194
00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:42.520
Vietnam guards?
Yeah,

195
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.680
<v 1>World War II guys.
There was one guy named um,
um,
Goddamn and Tom,</v>

196
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.690
great big tall guy,
crew cut

197
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.590
and,
and he was a World War II.
Udt Guys,
let me tell you this story on that guy.

198
00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:01.340
So we're out of,
we just get the same committee,
the last part of the training,

199
00:12:01.341 --> 00:12:05.750
you know,
third phase,
you know,
so we're all lined up there.

200
00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:08.750
We just got off.
We went out there,
I'm an Lcu,
you know,

201
00:12:08.751 --> 00:12:11.150
with all of our demo and ammo and all that other crap.

202
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.750
We just mustered out there in this guy comes walking up,
great big tall guy,

203
00:12:15.751 --> 00:12:19.980
real old,
what was I,
1918.
You know what I mean?

204
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.240
He looked probably like,
uh,
you do or I do.
And we thought it was an old guy,

205
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.090
but he looks at us and he starts talking,
you know,
and he goes,
goddammit,
uh,

206
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.910
I'm the,
I'm your demo instructor.
And uh,
keeps talking to me.
He says,

207
00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:35.270
I don't Brooke,
no bullshit on the ranges,
you know,

208
00:12:35.271 --> 00:12:38.370
and we're kind of just looking at him like,
what the hell?
And he gets himself,

209
00:12:38.371 --> 00:12:42.320
worked up a little bit and he goes,
um,
matter of fact,
uh,

210
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.740
anybody that screws up,

211
00:12:43.741 --> 00:12:46.500
we'd just go out behind the shitter and get it squared away,
you know,

212
00:12:46.501 --> 00:12:47.940
and work still looking at him.

213
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.080
He talks a little bit more and get some self all excited and shit.
And he goes,

214
00:12:52.081 --> 00:12:56.100
matter of fact,
anybody wants to guy behind the shitter right now?
We'll go,

215
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.060
you know,
we're just looking at,
well come to find out later on,

216
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.320
it was in the 82nd airborne and jumped into Normandy,
got captured,

217
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:08.740
escaped on and on.
And then he was in the Korean War too.

218
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:12.430
That was one of our instructors.
Almost all of them there were in the Korean War,

219
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.410
you know,
pretty much.
But,
uh,
then we had another guy
and um,

220
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:22.300
on his jacket he wore,
he had a Udt instructor and the other side was God,

221
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.410
you know,
he was,

222
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.680
he was a hook nose Indian Apache and he was a bad ass dude.

223
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:32.260
And then they had some great guys.
And now most of the instructors,
yeah,

224
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:36.370
we're a,
and some were Vietnam guys,
you know,
like,
um,
um,

225
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.380
had this one blue eyed guy,
he was,
oh,

226
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.100
I can't think of his name right now either,
but he was,
I'm

227
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.750
on vacation,
was paddling up north in

228
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:56.220
the Columbia River,
so,
no,
not that north,
the east coast side.
And uh,
his,

229
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:01.140
he was a on a excursion with some other people in his canoed tipped over.
And,
uh,

230
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.590
he was real cold and shit and he was trying to swim a couple of them to shore

231
00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:07.540
and Shit and just uh,
just one out.

232
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:12.400
But this guy would run behind you and you of course we didn't have a lot of hair

233
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:13.720
but what we had stood up,

234
00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:15.990
you know and you turn and look and there he was just staring at,

235
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.330
she had these blue eyes,
you know,
I'll think of his name in a minute.

236
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.290
And real good guy though.

237
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:20.701
<v 0>And there,</v>

238
00:14:20.701 --> 00:14:25.110
there must've been a cause is pretty regimented now but they must have had,

239
00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:28.620
no it was,
it was definitely less regimented when I went through for sure.

240
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:34.090
It must have been completely just like no rules when you went through

241
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.213
<v 1>now wait,
this guy,</v>

242
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.920
during hell week he had what they called the swimmer line and like I say,

243
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:44.420
we're on the bay side mind you were in training in January,

244
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.450
started three January seven colder and God,

245
00:14:48.451 --> 00:14:50.850
you know what he would do as a,
we had all,

246
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.020
he have us hook into what we call the Florida board line.
You know,
like you,

247
00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:58.730
when you do recon is a guys hold on the line,
you move down the line and stuff.

248
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.210
And uh,
he had sent us all out and hell there is about,

249
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.453
<v 2>okay</v>

250
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.600
<v 1>fuck you about 60 of us,
excuse me,
good.</v>

251
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.691
Send us out.

252
00:15:10.691 --> 00:15:14.020
And we had to be in a straight line if we weren't bringing us all back and line

253
00:15:14.021 --> 00:15:18.910
us all up again and we weren't straight.
So he sent us out again,

254
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.700
brought us all back in and we're freezing.

255
00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:24.040
The guys are almost getting hypothermia cause we're not,

256
00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:25.440
we're just in a k pocket,

257
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.400
not your regular utilities that you wear for training.
Yeah.

258
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.450
So he sent us out again the third time and like if you're on the bitter end
line,

259
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:38.530
you're,
you're,
you're screwed.
You know?
Then he brought us back in.
He goes,

260
00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:41.200
well God damn,
I guess it still wasn't very,
uh,

261
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.990
you guys still weren't in a straight line and we may,

262
00:15:43.991 --> 00:15:46.690
we're going to have to send you out again all the way down the line.

263
00:15:46.691 --> 00:15:49.120
All you heard was click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click.

264
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.200
We just looked at him.
Wow.
All right.

265
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.890
We got other things to do,
but it was it.
We're done man.

266
00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.960
Every day he had a loss of yeah.

267
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.580
<v 0>Class
that was so cold.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

268
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.430
People always,
uh,
if,

269
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.810
if you don't know California and you think California is like Baywatch,

270
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.200
the old TV show,
do you think the water's all warm?
It's not warm.
It's not warm.

271
00:16:13.201 --> 00:16:17.760
Especially in January.
Yeah.
January 3rd it's not going to be warm.
And,

272
00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:21.240
and you were saying you guys were swimming like crazy going through that because

273
00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:22.640
you knew that you're going to Udt

274
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.350
<v 1>that's it.
So you're a frog.
Frogman that's what you're being trained for,</v>

275
00:16:26.351 --> 00:16:29.710
not seals.
So we did a lot more water work.

276
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:34.270
And you guys did going through buds because we didn't have the seal portion of

277
00:16:34.271 --> 00:16:37.540
it.
We got that after we made our deployment,
came back,
went and seal team.

278
00:16:37.541 --> 00:16:39.550
Then you went to a cadre.
Yup.

279
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.250
<v 0>Did you get any land warfare at all?</v>

280
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.041
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

281
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:48.041
A little bit more like basic stuff and a little immediate IUD has been immediate

282
00:16:48.671 --> 00:16:52.240
action drills,
but not much.
It was a,
like our last stop that we had,

283
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:55.660
I think I told you this and uh,
on thank you.
Many was a,

284
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.400
we did swim or scouts in on the other side of,
uh,

285
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.550
a rock formation.
We called bird shit rock and got to the island.

286
00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:08.551
They gave us all a 40 pound hammer sacks and we went from there all the way 23

287
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:13.930
miles to the end of the island.
We blew up walking.
Yeah.

288
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.470
<v 0>Okay.
So you Hump 23 miles after you swam over the</v>

289
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.460
<v 1>yeah.
And then came back and attack the camp.
That was our last top.</v>

290
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.090
<v 0>Hm.
That's a,
that's a crappy patrol two does cactus,
I know</v>

291
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.740
<v 1>I was smart.
I was thought I was pretty smart city,
so I wore a,
um,
kind of a,
um,</v>

292
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.450
what sue,
what do you call that?
The small one,
you know?
Oh,
like a wetsuit.

293
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.120
And because I,
you know,
so I wouldn't freeze to death coming in.

294
00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:43.980
And actually this was April,

295
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.780
almost the end of April and it was still cold out of San Clemente,
you know,

296
00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:53.280
so we swam in and I hummed to that thing on all the way up there and it got

297
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:57.330
sunny and warm,
almost frigging died back.

298
00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.980
You can peel it off me like this.

299
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.730
<v 0>There's no good,
there's no good way to do it.</v>

300
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.210
There's like no good way to handle coming over the beach is not going to be

301
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:07.650
convenient.
You're not going to be comfortable.

302
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.350
That's one of the things that makes,
in my opinion,

303
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.780
the one of the things that makes the seal team,

304
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.430
the guys in the seal teams are really good,

305
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.220
is that we just have to deal with the water and as soon as you're dealing with

306
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.100
water,
like you just said,
there's no easy way to do that.

307
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.400
Like you're going to either be freezing in the water or you can be sweating on

308
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:27.750
land or you're going to be too hot.
Oh No,
actually you're not.
You're going to,

309
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:30.210
you're going to be okay in the on the,
on the land.
It's,

310
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.290
you're just screwed is what I'm saying.
And not to mention your weapons,

311
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.750
your weapons all get your radios all get jacked up,

312
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.630
your weapons all get jacked up,
your gear gets all jacked up.

313
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.370
You got sand in your boots,
there's no good way to deal with it.
No,
there's no,

314
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.950
and on top of that,
the communications,
like you're in the water,

315
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:50.190
you can't talk to people,
you can't,
there's no radios aren't working.

316
00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:54.300
It's just everything sucks.
And so when we were do ops dry,

317
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.580
it just seems like it's so easy to do.

318
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.210
And I think that's the one big thing that separates,
it doesn't separate us,

319
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:02.850
but it's one of the things that makes us good is that we have to deal with the

320
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.190
water and we deal with in our whole career.

321
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.390
<v 1>Bottom line is you should never bring a boat to shore.
You always swimming.
Yup.</v>

322
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.840
That's what we do.
Yup.
Just like swimmers,
scouts,
the whole nine yards.

323
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.590
That's the bottom line was a chief.
I was pretty hard on that stuff.

324
00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:18.590
We never brought the boats to shore.
Yeah.

325
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.000
<v 0>You know,
we,
we,
we did the same thing when we were in the art platoon.</v>

326
00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:26.410
We never brought the boats in because there's a,
there's that 10,
15,

327
00:19:26.411 --> 00:19:29.080
maybe 20% chance that you're going to flip a boat,
you're going to lose a boat,

328
00:19:29.081 --> 00:19:30.730
something's going to happen to a boat,
and then you're screwed.

329
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.310
Now you got to bolt washing up against the shore and you got to deal with it.

330
00:19:33.311 --> 00:19:35.580
And it's a big no,
we always swam in it.

331
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.310
<v 1>It's a big,
it's a big target.
Yeah,
for sure.
For sure.
In Desert Storm,
you know,</v>

332
00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:44.340
and we inserted those coin.
He's the,
uh,
officer,
I won't mention any names,

333
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:46.860
but wanting to bring both the boats in,
you know,

334
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.210
and into Kuwait and let the Kuwaiti guys off and I went,
no,

335
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:54.840
he keep at least if you're going to do that,
keep one bolt back.

336
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:58.080
Even if he keep another bowling shirt because they can give cover he fire,

337
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.410
you know what I'm saying?
And then if they have to,
and he,
and you know,

338
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:04.230
you can be seen,
you know what I mean?
It's,
that's a big target,

339
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.360
you know what I mean?
You just don't do that,
you know?

340
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.640
<v 0>No,
that's,
there's so many things.</v>

341
00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:11.270
You've got to figure out what the water and when you,
when you guilt.

342
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.720
That's why when we were in Iraq and we rarely did boat ops,
we did some in,
in,

343
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:19.080
in the river.
But you're just telling all either on foot,
it just,

344
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:23.510
everything is so much easier.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
Uh,

345
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.240
that you get,
so you get done with training Cinco de Mayo,

346
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:32.390
1967 you get done with training and you check into Udt 12 and you didn't really

347
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:33.900
know too much about the seal teams,
I guess.

348
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:36.150
No one at that time knew much about the symptoms.

349
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.670
And you were saying on that first podcast that we did that the platoons weren't

350
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:45.240
really formed up yet.
You kind of showed up at Udt and you're,
it's,
it's,

351
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:50.110
it's kind of a loose situation,
but do you do,
do a workup call?
Once we started

352
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.190
<v 1>working up then it was regimented,
you know,
you knew what cad to do,</v>

353
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:58.490
but we had a while they had just come back and relieved a UDT 11 had just

354
00:20:58.801 --> 00:21:03.150
deployed and then 12 came back and you have a kind of a stand down for about a

355
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.740
month or two showed up for them.
Yeah.
Okay.

356
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.670
Cause it's a nine month deployment for UDTs.

357
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.840
So you have about a six months workup and then you have three months where the

358
00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:15.650
guys go on leave schools and stuff like that.
And we came,

359
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.620
I came in just at that time,
so it was really kind of like,
uh,

360
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.420
we'd go up and do what they call silver slippers up at a Pendleton when the

361
00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:28.230
marines are doing fibia slide needs and we'd be the lifeguards and stuff like

362
00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:31.430
that.
And you know what I mean?
Until we start forming up and start working,

363
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.940
then it got,
it got pretty good.

364
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.370
<v 0>What did you guys do?
Was that where they hardcore about PT back then?
Oh yeah.</v>

365
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:42.320
What'd you guys do?
Team pts,
platoons or team?
Team.
The whole team?
Yep.

366
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:47.720
And was it every every day?
Was it the same?
Was it flutter,
kicks,

367
00:21:47.721 --> 00:21:48.890
pushups,
pull ups,

368
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.790
<v 1>basic PT.
In fact,</v>

369
00:21:50.791 --> 00:21:55.170
I did and start lifting weights until I was in about

370
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.520
15 years,
maybe 16,
17 years because a,

371
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.040
you do old corners swimming.
All the PT we did and everything.

372
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.500
We were in really good shape.
I mean,
you know what I mean?

373
00:22:07.501 --> 00:22:11.340
And you didn't see a lot of the guys in the gym lifting heavy and stuff that

374
00:22:11.341 --> 00:22:13.500
came on later on.
Then also,

375
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.670
which I changed when I was later on when I was a chief and a senior chief and

376
00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:21.330
stuff.
And uh,
even,
uh,
no,
not as an LPO.

377
00:22:21.331 --> 00:22:25.160
We still did platoon PT every morning.
But uh,

378
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.470
we'd do it every other day then let the guys go off and do their running,

379
00:22:28.471 --> 00:22:31.830
do there Pete weightlifting and stuff like that and they'll work out well,

380
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.340
you know,
you can change.
Even though I thought PT in the morning,

381
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.110
first thing it was the best to do,
especially when we were in Subic and

382
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.470
half the guys would be thrown up and stuff.
We were doing PT.

383
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.200
<v 0>Yeah.
I always like we used to at team one when I got t one there was that,</v>

384
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.710
that team PT we did everyday and team two is the same thing,
but you know,

385
00:22:51.711 --> 00:22:53.300
I'll tell you once the war started,

386
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.390
there's a lot less focused on PT n it just was and she wore a yard to Jocko.

387
00:22:59.781 --> 00:23:03.410
You can't really go for long runs and shit where you're in a rock and

388
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:10.930
we'd run around bases.
Did you guys have,
uh,
my,
my question is,
uh,

389
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.610
did you take weights with you?
Did you have a workout place and stuff?
Yeah,

390
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:19.370
that we deployed and actually once one team shows up somewhere on deployment,

391
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.290
they all bring a bunch of gear and then there's enough to do it to get it done.

392
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.400
And then other teams,
they don't have to bring everything,

393
00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:30.270
but they'll bring more stuff and eventually,
you know,

394
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.830
whatever compound here in is pretty nice.
If you go to the bag saved,
calm down.

395
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.050
Yeah.
And uh,
and I was bribed,
brought maths for,
for Jujitsu.

396
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.150
I'd make a little Jujitsu area so I could still course

397
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.620
so I could still train and get the boys trading.
And um,

398
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.040
do you know what's funny too is like you were talking about it,

399
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.490
it's weird how some of this stuff stays cause you were talking about walking

400
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:57.260
around in Udt shorts and,
and choral boots and,
and unfortunately UDT shorts.

401
00:23:57.261 --> 00:23:59.520
I don't think guys wearing them,
I don't think they even get issued him anymore.

402
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.340
But when I got the team one,

403
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.000
we absolutely got issued UDT shorts and that's what work.
That was our uniform.

404
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.780
And we got issued coral booties,
those old gray coral booties.

405
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.530
And I didn't realize,
you know,
that's what you guys wore and that's,

406
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.890
that's something that they've probably been issued for.
I Dunno.

407
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.400
<v 3>He went out in town,</v>

408
00:24:17.401 --> 00:24:21.730
you'd see guys with the core Blue Levi's and there were all actual auction
stuff.

409
00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:24.340
You know what I mean?
You can pick out a team guy in a heartbeat.

410
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.040
<v 0>Yeah.
I,
I was,
uh,
I was,
I looked,</v>

411
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.780
I looked up coral booties and I was just seeing if anybody makes them anymore.

412
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.920
They're hard to get there on Ebay.
You got to buy a pair on Ebay,

413
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.550
you gotta be lucky if they have your size.

414
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.970
I got to go through my gear and see if I still have my choral booties.
Um,

415
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:40.743
<v 3>but,</v>

416
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.370
<v 0>and then you did do a legit work up though,
where you did all your hydro recon.</v>

417
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:51.470
<v 3>Yeah.
Only last hour.
We cons,
uh,
like a up the coast by Penelton.
Uh,</v>

418
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.400
we'd drug this one rocket looked in thing in up over these fucking mountains and

419
00:24:56.401 --> 00:25:00.590
put it in the lake and stuff like that.
And then we swam across the,
uh,

420
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:02.730
uh,
well did we swim?
No,

421
00:25:02.731 --> 00:25:06.330
we didn't right there at the channel and it goes out and you have those old gun

422
00:25:06.331 --> 00:25:08.790
emplacements and shit,
but it will attack those.

423
00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:10.710
And they had them set up of booby traps and stuff,

424
00:25:10.711 --> 00:25:14.800
so we'd go across and work her way up and shit like that.
Always stuff.
Yeah.

425
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:20.080
And Udt it was,
it wasn't bad.
It was good training.
I mean,
but it wasn't,
you know,

426
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.020
like a story I told you it was,
um,

427
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.650
during the 67 68 tet,
we're in Dong Tam on the ass.
Scary.

428
00:25:29.651 --> 00:25:33.580
And that's when we were who I was with Udt and there were about 17 of us on

429
00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:36.790
there.
We're doing that dark thing later on,
getting that a little bit more.

430
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:41.080
But uh,
that's when we worked with the ninth infantry and stuff.
And uh,
anyway,
uh,

431
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.190
they had a seal platoon in Mito,
which wasn't too too far away,

432
00:25:45.191 --> 00:25:48.230
but it was right in the town.
Why these coasts would have a,

433
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.630
would have a place in,
in a town.

434
00:25:52.631 --> 00:25:56.080
I'd never know because anytime you left her when any work,

435
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.450
you know what I'm saying?
You can be picked out.
But anyway,

436
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.990
so they were almost getting overran,
but they were on the tallest building.

437
00:26:01.991 --> 00:26:06.670
They had a 57 recoilless rifle and stuff.
Anyway,
they send a call out,
hey,

438
00:26:06.671 --> 00:26:10.390
we need help.
And there were 17 of us,
you know,
on the ass.

439
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:14.410
Scary Udt guys.
We wanted to go in and rescue them and save them.

440
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:19.780
And our officer,
just a great guy,
lieutenant said,
now he ain't going anywhere.

441
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.710
We're so proud.
You got an in their helicopter.
We don't know.
Don't even know.

442
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.450
We just wanted to go and help him pay card ready to go.
Yeah.

443
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:33.030
You know there are seals but the t guys do.
So anyway.
So,
um,

444
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.390
we didn't do that.

445
00:26:34.391 --> 00:26:38.960
And then I got back from deployment when the seal team went to the cadre and

446
00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:43.440
then those guys,
by the way,
they didn't get overrun.
No,
they,
they've them on.

447
00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.251
They were coming up,

448
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:48.120
the stairways never thrown grenade down at him and stuff like that.

449
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:52.860
And then finally the Arvin and the u s came in and took me to go back over.

450
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:56.580
It was during the 67 68,
10 you go bad.
But anyway,

451
00:26:56.581 --> 00:27:00.990
so when I got back and I went through cadre Sefa found out,
you know,

452
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.070
all day we weren't ready for this.
We didn't know any immediate action drills.

453
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.160
Well not a lot.
Not,
not,
you know,
pounded of newer head roll.

454
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.040
We'd automatically think about them,
any urban environment whatsoever.

455
00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.680
Say Plus we were in urban and that was urban would add our asses handed to us

456
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.310
cause we didn't know we were fighters would have fought.
But,
you know,

457
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.670
figured those guys in me told the VC and stuff there,

458
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.000
they had their shit together.
That was their town and stuff.
You know what I mean?

459
00:27:30.001 --> 00:27:33.780
We'd,
uh,
you know more about the urban stuff than I do,

460
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.590
cause they never fought urban,
you know,
we'd hit who chews and stuff like that,

461
00:27:37.591 --> 00:27:42.280
but we never swept through.
Uh,
we did one village one time,
but it was,
you know,

462
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.770
it was good.
You know what I mean?

463
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.820
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And so when you deployed to with Udt,</v>

464
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.400
did you guys write a ship over there?
Do you fly over there?

465
00:27:51.401 --> 00:27:52.234
How'd you get to Vietnam?

466
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.580
<v 3>We flew over to Subic Bay and I'm like,
I said,
uh,</v>

467
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.840
that's where we were at.
That's like,
you went to Guam.

468
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.590
We'll sue because our place who be pay and then,
uh,
they would,
uh,

469
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.610
would fly over to,
uh,

470
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.170
we had different debts that we hadn't Vietnam,

471
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.990
like in Denang,

472
00:28:11.991 --> 00:28:16.980
they had camped in Cha and from the Nang you'd workup and around food.
Why Way?

473
00:28:16.981 --> 00:28:20.460
Quine three Dung Hall,
the northern part of the area and stuff,
you know,

474
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:24.520
and then we got on the Diatchenko and I'm don't know if we picked the Dutch,

475
00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:27.070
she incorporate Subic or not.
We might have.
And then when,

476
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.540
when we did all them Beecher's guns and then the next debt I went to was down in

477
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.180
Dong Tam on the [inaudible] back to Subic inbetween at all.
Oh yeah.
Oh really?

478
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.920
And we'd be there for about a month or three weeks.
And

479
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.120
<v 0>so we had to basically deploy from Subic out to Vietnam,</v>

480
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.060
do operations for a month,
then go back three months,

481
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.480
over three months in three months at a time.
Yeah.
Well,

482
00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.840
but it's a nine month deployment.
Yeah.

483
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.370
<v 3>So yeah,
we,</v>

484
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:56.450
my three deaths were Denang then under Diatchenko and then down in Dong Tam when

485
00:28:56.631 --> 00:29:00.190
I,
as in Udt.
And that was three months at each place.
Yeah.

486
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.990
<v 0>And first of all,
on the last one you talked,</v>

487
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:08.510
talked about doing 130 miles worth of beach week.
It was about 120 I think.
Yeah,

488
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.470
it was three months.
I mean,
you know,
but you know,

489
00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:15.710
you were kind of talking about it like,
oh you know,
we were doing this weekend,

490
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.000
but that was,
you were,
you were recounting beaches in north Vietnam.
No,

491
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.160
south South Vietnam.
And was there any resistance?

492
00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:26.640
Were you guys in jeopardy of getting rolled up or was it more of like almost an

493
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:28.480
admin thing or was it somewhere in between?
Okay.
We,

494
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.470
<v 3>we always had to either marines or the arb,</v>

495
00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:35.340
which was the south Vietnamese army.

496
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:40.500
They would screen put screens out when we'd do the beaches to cover us in case

497
00:29:40.501 --> 00:29:41.880
we got hit with anything.
Right.

498
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.730
<v 1>Cause they were,
nobody knew what was really on the beaches and stuff.</v>

499
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.080
But if the marines were in the area,

500
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:50.800
they'd had sent a patrol and they had worked the back back chores and stuff as

501
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:53.680
we're doing our recon and stuff.
And the one that I've told you I,

502
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:57.460
we got hit was we didn't have any army,
army or marine.

503
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:01.990
So we sent two of our guys in the back to kind of check things out as we're

504
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:04.100
doing a recon.
And that's when we got cotton.

505
00:30:04.101 --> 00:30:08.010
At almost cotton that a l shaped ambush.
And uh,

506
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.580
what happened was as we were coming down the beach and we had the guys out and I

507
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:13.770
was a good talker first saw,

508
00:30:13.771 --> 00:30:18.771
I was out front with another guy and I had a pair of bathing suit,

509
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:23.380
a UDTs on coral booties and my super sweet and I was writing in the back shore

510
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:24.214
information

511
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.760
<v 0>so everyone knows what we're talking about.</v>

512
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.970
When you're going to land people on beaches or if you're potentially going to

513
00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:33.060
land people on beaches,
you have to do a reconnaissance of the beach,

514
00:30:33.061 --> 00:30:34.470
but not just of the beach itself,

515
00:30:34.471 --> 00:30:37.950
but of the water and how deep the water is and make sure there's no obstacles in

516
00:30:37.951 --> 00:30:38.670
there.

517
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:43.380
And so the people that did this since World War II was the underwater demolition

518
00:30:43.381 --> 00:30:47.390
teams.
So that's what we're talking about.
The way you do it is you,
you have a,

519
00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.790
literally,
you have a line,
a big rope.
It's small,

520
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.930
it's more like a line than it is real.
But that stretches from the beach,

521
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.960
from a couple guys on the beach called the beach party all the way out to a

522
00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.830
boat.
A small little rubber boat.

523
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.670
<v 1>Yeah.
And that was an IBS.
We hooked it tune,</v>

524
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:10.050
it's about 30 feet as knots where you know each pair is going to be holding onto

525
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.020
and you mark take the sounding than you as you went to the next sounding,

526
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:19.350
which was 25 yards down the beach.
And on the beats it'd be holding up these,
uh,

527
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.230
markers so that you could get yourself on them.

528
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.580
You'd be dippy doing down until you got to that point again.

529
00:31:26.581 --> 00:31:29.190
Then you'd take your sounding mix and then he'd come back and make a

530
00:31:29.191 --> 00:31:30.270
hydrographic charts.

531
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:34.970
<v 0>So there's guys on the beach that are holding what we call range markers and</v>

532
00:31:34.971 --> 00:31:36.830
they're set,
what did they sound like?
10 yards apart,

533
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.510
looking at one guy in the front,
one guy in the back,

534
00:31:38.511 --> 00:31:40.910
and they're looking at a compass so that they're making sure that they're lined

535
00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:43.940
up.
So that lines up this whole line.
So it's this,

536
00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:48.980
it's this kind of complicated in,
it seems like an administrative thing,

537
00:31:48.981 --> 00:31:51.230
but you got to do it.
Otherwise,
you know,

538
00:31:51.231 --> 00:31:54.320
you get a situation where the marines come into land and they hit a,

539
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:58.710
like they did.
Yeah,
they did an entire war and they handle no big data,

540
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.190
a reef and then they dropped the ramps,

541
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:05.000
the guys get out and they didn't know that that reef was only 10 feet long.

542
00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.200
It's two feet deep.

543
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.710
But now on the other side of the reef there guys are going into 10 1215 feet of

544
00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:10.544
water and drown.

545
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.170
So that's why you have to actually be fairly precise or as least as precise as

546
00:32:15.171 --> 00:32:16.400
you can be when you're taking these,

547
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.420
when you're doing this hydrographic reconnaissance.
So

548
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.410
<v 1>yeah,
have the back shore party,</v>

549
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.500
you know the two guys there and they have the officer and a couple of other guys

550
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.850
picking up the stakes,
the stakes out and that's usually cartographers job.

551
00:32:28.851 --> 00:32:33.060
You were way out ahead of everybody else taking the back shore information so

552
00:32:33.061 --> 00:32:37.230
that when you come back and do your I do graphic chart,
you know,
you,

553
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.400
you can lay it out.
Exactly.
Then you have to do Leroy

554
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.200
<v 0>and I was a cartographer.
I know all the ships.
So which I hated the man.</v>

555
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.010
Make your hand draw the maps,
your hand drawn that and those,
those,

556
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.090
those charts that you draw that you're going to present,

557
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:54.890
those are going to get presented to,
you know,
the,

558
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:58.790
the navy and they're gonna use those charts to conduct is landing.

559
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.610
So like I said,
they gotta be good.
You gotta be good quality.

560
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.000
<v 1>Yeah.
Anyway,
so,
uh,</v>

561
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:07.260
there are two guys are walking along and we were doing or beach reconnaissance

562
00:33:07.261 --> 00:33:08.730
and everything.
Well,
they,
they,
uh,

563
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.880
had an l shaped ambush on us and they had a spider hole back here with a cup of

564
00:33:14.061 --> 00:33:16.920
guys that once we got hit and if anybody ran back,

565
00:33:16.921 --> 00:33:21.360
these guys in holds him down or two guys hit those two guys and the spider hole

566
00:33:21.361 --> 00:33:24.660
and opened up on them,
which made them open up on the sooner.

567
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.590
So we all leapfrog back down the beach.

568
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.560
Really great guy.
Mean he took charge,
everything was perfect.

569
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:38.750
We grabbed onto the line to bolt the IBS took off and you know,
nine and a whore,

570
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.590
nine and a half horsepower range and didn't go real fast,
you know.

571
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.750
And then we had a coast guard cutter out there.

572
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:48.440
They started lobbing in a Willy Peter on them,

573
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:51.350
but we didn't know it was them and some of it landed pretty close to us.

574
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:54.960
So we thought there was them doing,
trying to hit us and we,

575
00:33:54.961 --> 00:33:59.780
we got out far enough and our pl that we finally got to and got on appeals.

576
00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:03.160
Uh,
you know,
the both that the,
uh,
uh,

577
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.240
that we inserted it off of and stuff.
And,
uh,

578
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.380
they picked us up and the guy who was shooting is 50 and stuff.

579
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:13.400
But what was really neat was income.
These two jets.
Oh.

580
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.760
And they napalm the whole beach.
That was,

581
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.960
that was kind of cool.
And that's when I told you when I got back to the boat,

582
00:34:20.961 --> 00:34:22.960
I said,
screw this naked warrior shift.

583
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.200
<v 0>I can't hear you.</v>

584
00:34:25.201 --> 00:34:30.201
So you're in a pair of UDTs call booties with walkers.

585
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:36.270
They're like,
they're like chuck converse.
Chuck Taylor's a little bit leaner.

586
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.320
The split for the,
no,
no,

587
00:34:40.321 --> 00:34:44.910
it was just like Congress.
So you could walk on coral,

588
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:50.010
get cut,
hold you down.
They're not big.
They weren't,
they were like,

589
00:34:50.011 --> 00:34:52.380
they were canvas and they had a kind of a rural,

590
00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:57.360
thick rubberized bottom on it day.
Yeah,
they were good.
And then,
uh,
I had an m 79,

591
00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:59.670
so I'm shooting that thing as I'm running back and stuff.

592
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.980
Then that's the only weapon you have,
is it?

593
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.580
That's all I had that in your slate to draw on.
Yeah,

594
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:08.610
collect back shorter for me.
I see.
That was kind of exciting.

595
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.100
And was that before you,
was that,

596
00:35:11.101 --> 00:35:14.910
was that recon before you work with the ninth infantry?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

597
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.840
I went from there,

598
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:20.870
from the Diatchenko down to Dong Tam and work with the ninth infantry and the,

599
00:35:20.971 --> 00:35:24.240
uh,
the ninth infantry man.

600
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.910
So this stuff I was looking about,
you know,

601
00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:30.840
about the ninth infantry and what they did and just first of all,

602
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.160
the ninth infantry is the,

603
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.880
is the unit that the fictional character Forrest Gump was supposed to be

604
00:35:38.431 --> 00:35:42.150
attached to,
which is why in the movies working by the water and all that stuff,

605
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.970
I imagine that's what they,
that's why they picked it.
Uh,

606
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.720
the ninth infantry in Vietnam had 10 medal of honors awarded to soldiers and

607
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.870
three sailors.

608
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.500
So they were working in conjunction very closely with the Brown water navy,

609
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.910
which again,
to pull a quote from the last time you,
you were on Roger,

610
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:07.911
you're like saying that job as being brown water navy was just vicious.

611
00:36:08.071 --> 00:36:13.071
John Vicious job and general Westmoreland said that the Ninth Infantry Division

612
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:19.130
and the mobile riverine forces saved the Delta region from falling to the north

613
00:36:19.171 --> 00:36:21.300
Vietnamese during,
during tet.

614
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.180
<v 3>That could have been,
I mean,
I didn't,
I wasn't on land with them.</v>

615
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.260
Don't know where we're thinking.

616
00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:29.950
We did remember I was a second class then and we got,
we were on the,
uh,

617
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.833
the um,

618
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.640
ask Gary in Benawashi as a reconnaissance guys.

619
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.740
We ask Gary and better water once they were apds.
What's that?
Um,
uh,

620
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:43.650
and Tibias some,
some kind of an amphibious ship.
Yeah.

621
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.360
Both of them were big ones and croup chips coop.

622
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.950
I think the ask Gary was a troop ship.
I'm not sure.

623
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.420
It could have been the Benwalk too,

624
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.390
but they were pretty good size ships and they were right at,
uh,
on the,
uh,

625
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.620
right at dawn cam,

626
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.670
which was the Dong Tam when it had a big army base and a navy base.

627
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.110
And late my third trip to Vietnam,

628
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:11.430
I went back to her as a seal and it was a same,
same place,

629
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.530
same area.

630
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.620
<v 0>So when you,
how did you guys get linked up with the ninth infantry?</v>

631
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:19.510
<v 3>Well,
we,
uh,
that's who we're doing the reconnaissance 40 to thank you.</v>

632
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.380
Go up the canals and up the rivers,
you know,

633
00:37:22.381 --> 00:37:24.660
see what the depth was so they could bring the uh,

634
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.470
the Brown water navy up there that the troop carriers and stuff like that for

635
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:32.430
the ninth symmetry and they didn't know what the depth of the,

636
00:37:32.431 --> 00:37:36.510
some of the places they were going to go in.
So they dropped us off on these,
uh,

637
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.130
we called them the dark,

638
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:42.570
they were like a jet ski except you didn't sit up on him.
He laid down on them,

639
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:47.990
use your feet to guide them and they had a 355 degree camera and a feather

640
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:54.090
kilometer and they would dig to have a sub drop us off and we'd come down and do

641
00:37:54.091 --> 00:37:58.830
the reconnaissance.
I mean take soundings and take pictures of Nolan's point,

642
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:03.000
like a pagoda,
more another canal coming in or something.
You know,

643
00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:06.480
we'd come back and we'd do a chart and we'd give it to him and that's what they

644
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:10.410
used those charts to go up and do their a amphibious landings.

645
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:15.090
But you can only go up those down,
those things maybe once or twice.

646
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:17.700
And then you didn't do it again because it'd be waiting for you.

647
00:38:17.701 --> 00:38:21.480
So when we weren't doing that,
which you can only do so many of them,

648
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.840
then we started writing with the ninth infantry as their demo guys

649
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.340
<v 0>and,
and so you would,</v>

650
00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:30.880
would you have already seen it because you do the dark mission and then you'd

651
00:38:30.881 --> 00:38:33.190
come back and then they'd come up with their plan and then they'd say,
okay,

652
00:38:33.191 --> 00:38:36.190
we're going to go up that river that you just came down.
So you'd be from we,

653
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.530
<v 3>would you be familiar with it now?
No.
If they took us,</v>

654
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:41.370
we went up to four corners and the places that we had never been,

655
00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.790
that was deep enough for him to go up and stuff.
But uh,
they might might've,

656
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.040
I don't know.
You know,
that would have been John Odish.

657
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:52.300
My Ot would have probably been in on the planning when they were going to go in

658
00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.610
something and talk about our charts and stuff,
you know,

659
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.020
memorize just a booger reader,
one of the guys in the dark,
you know.

660
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.310
And uh,
but then they said,
okay,
we're going to need you.
What were the lock,

661
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.620
I know you were saying on the last podcast that they had these log dams at the,

662
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:07.421
Oh yeah,

663
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:12.421
they'd put dams across logs and stop the boats up and just different obstacles

664
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:14.680
and shit or bunkers long.
And uh,

665
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:17.920
we'd go in and blow up the bunkers or blow up the log dams,
you know,

666
00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:19.770
if they had them.
And that's what I said.

667
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.390
They first put us on what they called an Alpha boat,

668
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.280
which was the lead boat and they had one in the rear and one of the front.
And,

669
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:30.670
um,
what would they look like?
Um,
God,

670
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:34.480
I don't have a picture of where I can show you.
I actually asked anybody looks,

671
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:37.690
looks up on the ninth infantry.
There'll be able to see them.
But anyway,

672
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:39.820
the Alpha boat,
we were on one of those.

673
00:39:39.821 --> 00:39:43.690
And that's the one I told you we got sunk on cause it'd be 40 rock and hit us

674
00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:46.990
right in the exhaust and things started going down and we rented to shore.

675
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:51.040
If it had been a little bit higher to hit all those stacks of a c four,

676
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:55.210
we had so but and then they started putting us in about the third or fourth bolt

677
00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.860
back.
They didn't want the big demo load in the front alpha boat.

678
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.470
Yeah,
that makes sense.
Pretty much figured that one out.

679
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:07.300
So your boat gets hit with a rocket and it starts sinking.

680
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.430
And in the the,
was it like a chief front of the boat?
No,
I was,
could have been,

681
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.500
I just know her first class or something and they ran us up and then it starts

682
00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:20.340
sinking down and we got off,
did a little perimeter and then the um,

683
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:25.210
as IPL bolt came up and just holds everything down and we swam over to the Zippo

684
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:27.040
boat and got off the Zippo boat.

685
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.790
So named because after the Zippo lighter because as a flame thrower,
yes.

686
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:36.220
Right,
exactly.
I know I popped this stuff off like people know what it is.

687
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.280
You'd hadn't been there to see it,

688
00:40:39.281 --> 00:40:43.660
but I mean it came zipping up and then we swam over to it and we got on it and

689
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:47.320
got out of there and you got everyone out of there or nobody got hurt or killed

690
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:49.030
on that just that'd be 40 rocket.

691
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.910
And they started opening up at are the boats opened up to,

692
00:40:51.911 --> 00:40:55.600
and they had fifties you know,
Jesus Christ,
20 minutes.

693
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:57.850
Did you try and salvage any of the demo and leave it?

694
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:02.170
Well I actually blow it and we were going to come back and do that,

695
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.030
but they decided to have VOD do it.

696
00:41:04.031 --> 00:41:08.210
So EOD went back and blew the bolt up and all that crap.
So yeah,

697
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.230
cause it was just partly out of the water and stuff,
but they pissed us off.

698
00:41:12.231 --> 00:41:16.670
We're underwater.
Demolition was like,
you know,
WTF,
you know that,
you know,

699
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:21.460
that's what we do.
Well the EOD guys,
I guess they didn't have a lot to do,

700
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:25.510
so they sent him down there.
I don't know if it was army or navy EOD,

701
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:28.360
but who knows.
It's always good to blow things up.

702
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.440
That's one of my first deployment I returned rack.
We didn't blow very much up.

703
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:34.160
And when I went to my second deployment to Iraq,

704
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.370
<v 0>I kind of had the attitude is if we had the opportunity to blow something up,</v>

705
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:41.390
we were going to blow it up.
It seems like the smart thing to do,

706
00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:46.210
being able to take it apart,
polling place you load in place and uh,

707
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:49.920
that one,
you know on the,

708
00:41:49.921 --> 00:41:53.540
on the last podcast you were talking about that one operation that you went on

709
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.020
and you,

710
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:59.020
it was basically a giant ambush against the whatever,

711
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:04.241
seven or eight boats that you guys had that the ninth infantry had and they must

712
00:42:05.281 --> 00:42:10.281
have been prepared waiting for you got for this group to show up.

713
00:42:10.551 --> 00:42:13.730
I mean,
what do they,
what was the enemy that well organized at that point?

714
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:19.010
<v 3>Stay warm and Nice,
but when you got psyops guys dropping pamphlets in saying,</v>

715
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:23.190
you know,
we may be doing something in this area,
uh,
you know,

716
00:42:23.191 --> 00:42:26.220
all the good guys leave and stuff like that.
You know,

717
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:31.240
cy upset a lot to play with that or chopper's going around with their speakers

718
00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:35.970
and you know what I mean?
Yeah.
So yeah,
that particular one,

719
00:42:35.971 --> 00:42:40.440
there was another group of boats I went up ahead of us,
dropped off their guys,

720
00:42:40.441 --> 00:42:43.170
the ninth infantry and were coming back and we passed him.

721
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.030
And as soon as we got by him,

722
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.840
I'd say about 10 minutes and we got opened up on,

723
00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:52.890
they didn't hit the first group,
they just hit our group.
And uh,
you know,

724
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.310
that was a,
that was a bad day in dodge city,
but you know,

725
00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:01.020
you got hit really bad but you managed to get to the shore and put some of the

726
00:43:01.021 --> 00:43:02.700
guys off and stuff.
And it was,

727
00:43:02.701 --> 00:43:06.810
I think it was going to be a pincher movement where they came in.
Okay.
People,

728
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.520
cause they dropped the other guy's way off and there were three Udt guys on that

729
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.140
group.
And then there were three of us on the group that when we got done,
he had,

730
00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:20.800
<v 0>and your main mission was going to be demo if basically yeah.
But uh,</v>

731
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:25.590
yeah,
uh,
those,
uh,
those big,
it's weird.

732
00:43:25.591 --> 00:43:29.650
Those are like straight up amphibious operations.
The army's conducted.
Okay.

733
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.970
<v 3>Now think about that.
And the Marines are holding the DMS.</v>

734
00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.090
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

735
00:43:33.091 --> 00:43:35.900
You were saying that the marines were busy upholding the DNC at that time.

736
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.470
<v 3>Yeah.
That kind of blew me away that the,
but the ninth infantry did a good job.</v>

737
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:41.250
I mean,
they were fighters,
you know,

738
00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:46.040
and they were out of Washington state of Washington,
you know,
and uh,
they,

739
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:48.440
uh,
they were good,
good troop.

740
00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:52.450
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
what about,
uh,</v>

741
00:43:52.451 --> 00:43:56.980
another different difference?
I mean,
even with the ninth infantry,
those guys,

742
00:43:56.981 --> 00:44:01.150
I mean in Udt you guys are all volunteers and I mean,

743
00:44:01.151 --> 00:44:05.020
and you've said you would have been drafted and had you not joined.
What did you,

744
00:44:05.021 --> 00:44:06.640
did you notice any difference?

745
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:08.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

746
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.430
<v 0>Between drafted guys and guys that were volunteers?</v>

747
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:15.640
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

748
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.280
<v 3>Didn't really work with that many army guys in the ninth infantry.</v>

749
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.940
The only thing I can remember that stands out as,

750
00:44:21.941 --> 00:44:24.960
I had a second lieutenant come up to me when was on a river boat,

751
00:44:24.961 --> 00:44:27.350
one of the river boats.
They were about ready to land him.

752
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.340
And he came up to me with his map and asked me where he was,
you know,
oh.

753
00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.590
And that kind of,
I went,
hmm,
that's a second lieutenant.

754
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.600
She's leading a platoon or squad or guys in,
you know,

755
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:42.810
they kind of,
you know what I'm saying?
I just don't know.
I don't know.

756
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:44.580
My thought of that was,

757
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.930
is we were trained and we knew what we were going to do,

758
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:53.130
just like in seal team and we leaned forward and that's what we're going to do.

759
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:58.050
You're just picked off the street,
go through basic training,
and then you,
uh,

760
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.800
you know,
next thing you know,
you were up on a hill,

761
00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:04.590
Vietnam being over random stuff that's gotta be pretty traumatic,
you know.

762
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.790
But then again,
Americans are Americans.
We fight,
you know what I mean?
Regardless,

763
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:13.791
but I think we were more psychologically set for what we did.

764
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.880
Then you're,
because of the extra training we had and stuff,

765
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:22.880
plus the guys that trained us where a lot of more Vietnam guys and like I said,

766
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.210
Second World War in Korean.

767
00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.920
That gives you with the type of job they did and that that's what we do.

768
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:33.420
<v 1>You got wounded on that vision too.
Yeah.
Right.
How bad did you get wounded?
Yes.</v>

769
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.930
Some shrapnel on my foot and my leg.
No big thing.
Did you,

770
00:45:36.931 --> 00:45:39.450
did it take you out of the field for an amount of time at all?
In fact,

771
00:45:39.451 --> 00:45:43.050
I got up and started shooting along this guy,
this other guy,

772
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:48.540
we had this,
a buddy of ours,
I think I told you this,
he got hit really bad,

773
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:52.590
was rapping on his arms and legs and I called over to him after I moved my

774
00:45:52.591 --> 00:45:56.820
fingers and toes and everything and realize that we all got blown down and then

775
00:45:56.821 --> 00:46:00.090
uh,
went over to him and hitting him with morphine,
putting it through its color.

776
00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:02.580
Then the 30 gunner got blown off his gun.

777
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.760
So I got up there and started shooting a 30,
you know what I mean?
No big thing,

778
00:46:05.761 --> 00:46:08.320
but it's just what you do.
You know,
we're in a hurry.

779
00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.100
So you shoot back.

780
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.110
He got blown on the other side of him and calls over to him,

781
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.310
didn't see my pin through his collar.
So hits him with another shot of morphine,

782
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:21.144
you know,

783
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.800
and about four or five minutes he kind of set up like this and wanting to do

784
00:46:25.801 --> 00:46:27.360
something.
But he was,
he was screwed.

785
00:46:27.361 --> 00:46:31.010
He was hurt really bad and then got up and started shooting and stuff.

786
00:46:31.011 --> 00:46:34.310
And the guys that were down in everything,

787
00:46:34.311 --> 00:46:37.100
we're after the 30 ran out of Ammo.

788
00:46:37.101 --> 00:46:41.320
I started shooting sixteens and they hand us up.
Sixteens is shooting stuff,

789
00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:44.150
load them for us and shit.
And then like I said,

790
00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.650
the ramp went down and we started going in towards the beach to let the guys

791
00:46:48.651 --> 00:46:51.170
that weren't,
uh,
wounded,
get off.

792
00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.490
And we started taking fire right through the front.
So I went to one side,

793
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.630
you went to the other side and I was using uh,
uh,

794
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.200
m 79 to try to suppress fire and stuff.

795
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.750
And then we backed off and then we got out of there.

796
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.100
Did you insert any of the army guys?
Yeah,
about eight or nine of them,
you know,

797
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.230
and how big,
how many guys got inserted?

798
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.920
I was like a company or a company strength.
Yeah.
Not,
yeah,

799
00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.980
it was more than a company who was eight bolts a lot of people about you can put

800
00:47:17.981 --> 00:47:22.840
about 25,
30 guys on the boats.
Yeah.
Yeah,
we were here.
We,

801
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:26.170
like I said,
it was really a weird thing cause uh,
you know,

802
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:30.010
we're sitting there and then everything just started fire going

803
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.380
<v 3>off and we heard a number one boats hit.</v>

804
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.600
We're number four bolt [inaudible] number three,
number four.
Yeah.
Number two,

805
00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:40.270
boats hit number three boats hit.

806
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:42.900
And I remember I just turned and looked at it and said,
we're fucked.

807
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:45.751
And we got hit.

808
00:47:45.751 --> 00:47:50.751
And what it did is it has a canvas cover and they had all those wires stretchers

809
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.930
stacked up in the beef.
40 rocker was heading right towards the uh,
uh,

810
00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.890
uh,
the
conning tower,
you know what I mean,

811
00:48:01.891 --> 00:48:03.270
where their driver and everything,

812
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.290
but it went low and hit those stretchers and he just went,
you know,

813
00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:08.550
all that shit went out.
So

814
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.620
<v 0>did you guys get good medical training?</v>

815
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.640
I mean obviously you had to give morphine.
Well Udt yeah,

816
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.430
pretty good.
Yeah.

817
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.240
<v 3>But in the seal team we had extensive dental,
medical training factor.</v>

818
00:48:21.241 --> 00:48:25.130
First platoon I went over as a,
we had our first class Korman.
Okay.

819
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.410
Probably the best.
Every week he had run a sue,

820
00:48:28.411 --> 00:48:32.160
something rather was soggy head wounds or something,
sucking chest wounds.

821
00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:36.510
And we had the same stuff that you guys did a have the mannequins up in the

822
00:48:36.511 --> 00:48:40.890
woods and you'd have to run up and treat him and what to do.
And we uh,

823
00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.420
learned to give ourselves a serum albumin them in case the corpsman was hit or

824
00:48:45.421 --> 00:48:48.860
seven,
you need to give yourself an ID.
We did all that stuff.
Yeah.

825
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.930
All of us carry that with us.
Everybody had Seroquel Beaune them,

826
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.360
which is a blood volume expander,
you know what I mean?

827
00:48:54.361 --> 00:48:58.260
Just in case you had to have it.
But uh,
Udt not so much.

828
00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:03.170
We knew morphine,
we knew the basics,
some of the basics and you know,

829
00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:07.860
pressurize and tourney kits and stuff like that,
but not real,
real good.
And UTS,

830
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.650
<v 0>they do a good job with that t triple c class that they teach now.
Africa,</v>

831
00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.280
you forget what it stands for,
but it's good combat trauma.
You guys learn that.

832
00:49:16.281 --> 00:49:18.380
And so they know what to do when somebody gets hit.

833
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:22.760
Everybody in the platoon knows like a decent amount to get.
The guys stabilized

834
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:26.990
<v 3>told us in a platoon,
this is the one in 69,
he says,
Ya,
yeah,</v>

835
00:49:26.991 --> 00:49:30.860
I'm the only Corman here and if I get hit,
somebody's got to take care of me

836
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:36.890
<v 0>through extension.
Good for him.
So,
uh,</v>

837
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:42.290
you get home from that deployment and now like you said,
you,

838
00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:45.560
you knew you had enough of the naked warrior,
your stuff and you said,

839
00:49:45.561 --> 00:49:47.300
I want to get a big machine gun.

840
00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.390
<v 3>But I will say that was one of the best deployments I was on the guys and</v>

841
00:49:50.391 --> 00:49:51.224
everything.

842
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:56.410
The a Udt 12 at that time was comprised of class 40 41 and 42 and some are 43

843
00:49:58.941 --> 00:50:00.890
but everybody knew everybody.
You know what I mean?

844
00:50:00.891 --> 00:50:02.920
It was real tight and real good.

845
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:07.180
And Subic Bay who would put Guam to change oil?

846
00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.870
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Like I say,
after we'd been there for about three weeks,

847
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.410
you're ready to go to a,

848
00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.440
<v 0>yeah,
their debt just to get out of there.</v>

849
00:50:15.441 --> 00:50:19.290
He didn't go to Vietnam to stay pretty much.
No,
I didn't.

850
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.590
I never realized that you guys would go back to uh,
you know,

851
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.400
back to Subic Bay in the middle of deployments.
That's,

852
00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:27.890
that's kind of how well we,
for

853
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.500
<v 3>then you'd hit it off to your next year.
Like you said,</v>

854
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:34.160
we were there for nine months in each debt was about three months,

855
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:35.510
you know what I mean?
Maybe a little less,

856
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.470
but we'd have some downtime and see we can,
then we'd go over Jordan next debt,

857
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:44.660
which is pretty nice.
You know,
nine months is a long time,
but still,
you know,

858
00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.430
then actually back in the day,

859
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.110
Subic Bay was almost worse than Vietnam and some areas because a,

860
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.950
it was almost like the gangsters back in Chicago.
You had all these uh,

861
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:57.530
different gangs where after each other and shit mean when you're was walking

862
00:50:57.531 --> 00:51:01.570
down excise a,
you almost had to look around the corner to see if,
you know,

863
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.700
they were shooting at each other for your walk by and Shit.
It was,
uh,

864
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.360
it was pretty,
uh,
kind of like the wild wild

865
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:11.400
<v 0>you said that the whole Udt uh,</v>

866
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:15.910
12 at that time was made up of all guys from the same like five or six buds

867
00:51:15.911 --> 00:51:16.744
classes

868
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.670
<v 3>that were there too from the other classes.
But it was,
uh,</v>

869
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:25.290
the majority of us that were put into little platoons and suffer from class 40,

870
00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:29.870
39,
maybe three,
and I was ahead of a they mode.
A lot of them went down.

871
00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:32.790
Some went to 12 too.
They used to just put them in 11 and 12.

872
00:51:32.791 --> 00:51:35.820
You went to a Udt team,
right.
And then,
uh,
yeah,

873
00:51:35.821 --> 00:51:38.940
there are a lot of more guys that were behind us.

874
00:51:38.941 --> 00:51:43.170
But remember we only ran two classes a year in bud.
Oh no kid.
Yeah.

875
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.950
Two classes a year.
Yeah,
we get 39 was graduated

876
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.600
and then we started 40 and then we graduated and that's when 41 was starting.

877
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:57.630
You know what I mean?
What do they run now?
Like five.
Yeah,
something like that.

878
00:51:57.631 --> 00:52:00.450
Five,
six years,
something like five when I went through.
Yeah,
I think so.

879
00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:02.903
So

880
00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:07.710
<v 0>you had a good experience with Udt,
but you still wanted to oh yeah,</v>

881
00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.590
I've got to go come man.

882
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:13.840
<v 3>And we've put it into cit every month to go to seal team when they yelled at us</v>

883
00:52:13.841 --> 00:52:17.680
and said,
yeah,
not until you get back,
you know?
So when we got back,

884
00:52:17.681 --> 00:52:20.290
we were the first two out of Udt into Cadbury.

885
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.190
<v 0>Yeah.
That's awesome.
You know,
echo and I had a conversation,</v>

886
00:52:23.191 --> 00:52:26.940
I'll talk about how at seal team one when I was in training self silting one we

887
00:52:26.941 --> 00:52:31.050
called ourselves cod dre and I didn't really know where that came from but I

888
00:52:31.051 --> 00:52:35.130
knew that that was what it was called and we were proud that we are cadre.

889
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:37.790
But then I was listening to the podcasts that you,

890
00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:40.000
you came on and you were talking about copy and you guys actually called the

891
00:52:40.001 --> 00:52:43.680
cadre training.
That's what it is.
Qt was was cloudberry

892
00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.790
<v 3>guys that taught her were Kadri instructors and that just carried on.</v>

893
00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:51.310
I guess you don't tune training was different.
You know,

894
00:52:51.311 --> 00:52:54.370
once you got in your gut out to ask you to your cadre,

895
00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:57.670
then you went to a platoon,
then you went through platoon turning to,

896
00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.500
and that was still ran by some of the contrary.
On the contrary we can,

897
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:04.630
cause we had our own training,
so on team one team,

898
00:53:04.631 --> 00:53:07.950
one training cells been around that long though.
It was,
you know,
yeah.

899
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:09.970
That was the only team.
That's true.

900
00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.350
And it wasn't another team that Udt guys and seal guys.

901
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:18.380
<v 0>Yeah.
That workup or the cadre training.</v>

902
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:23.330
Now you started getting heavy with field craft with,
I mean,

903
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.090
oh everything.
Yeah,
all every ambushes,

904
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.731
<v 3>you name it.</v>

905
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:30.720
And then we had the Lmo river we worked on and the [inaudible] was a lot like

906
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:34.630
Vietnam.
They actually set up a whole thing there to look like a Villi.

907
00:53:34.631 --> 00:53:39.450
Jay had a little wooden outpost where that,
you know,
the whole nine yard,

908
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:40.760
you didn't have to work,
you'll go down,

909
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:44.310
get in and then work your way in and stuff.
And it was just like Vietnam.

910
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.370
It was pretty close.
And once again,

911
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:51.150
the people that are teaching you RF seals that are in Kadri now who'd probably

912
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:53.460
just got back from Vietnam,
so they got fresh

913
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.410
information from the backyard,

914
00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:01.200
but tune train our training tone t one every time it platoon came back,

915
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:06.180
they had pull two or three of the best guys from that platoon and put them into

916
00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:09.510
our training.
So,
and that was every platoon that came back,
they did that.

917
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:14.030
So he had a cross cut of all the different areas of Vietnam and guides that had

918
00:54:14.031 --> 00:54:15.630
been in there that did well.

919
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:20.631
And that that's who we had guys like just some great guys.

920
00:54:20.641 --> 00:54:25.410
I mean we got good training and I mean,
there was no bullshit because they knew,

921
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.330
we knew that what we learned there was going to save our asses in our buddies.

922
00:54:30.331 --> 00:54:33.990
But so we,
we,
uh,
got pounded into our heads.

923
00:54:33.991 --> 00:54:38.991
We did river and stream crossing of a lot because you had a lot of rivers and

924
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.090
you know,
small canal,

925
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.510
well not small canals has been pretty good size either walked on number one up

926
00:54:45.511 --> 00:54:50.070
there to the side or you want to cross them,
you know,
like as a 60 gunner,

927
00:54:50.071 --> 00:54:51.540
I always carried about three,
uh,

928
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:57.060
UDTs with me to help me fold across.
But I'm just saying,
yeah,

929
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.320
to judge the current.
Right.

930
00:54:58.321 --> 00:55:02.190
So when you went out it would bring you right in where you're supposed to be and

931
00:55:02.191 --> 00:55:05.080
stuff like that.
You know what I mean?
Just uh,
extensive training.

932
00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:06.900
The Alamo on rivers,
not real.

933
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:11.670
It's not a real fast moving stream,
but it has a good current in it.

934
00:55:11.671 --> 00:55:13.110
So you learned all that,
you know what I mean?

935
00:55:13.111 --> 00:55:17.430
All you learned what you had to have or your gear you had.

936
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:22.080
Like we'd do a swimming cool stuff with our sixties and shit to see where we

937
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:25.470
needed to have the flotation and stuff like that.
You know what I mean?

938
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:28.110
It was pretty good actually.
When I went out to Niland,

939
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:33.390
we didn't even have the camp out there.
We had a,
in Niland itself,

940
00:55:33.391 --> 00:55:38.391
the town there was a gas station and it had about four or five green little

941
00:55:38.791 --> 00:55:41.460
green trailers and that's where we stayed at.

942
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:46.020
And then they use a truck is up to where the canal was,
the shooting stuff.

943
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:49.380
And a lot of times we'd go up there,
then we'd run back and stuff,

944
00:55:49.381 --> 00:55:53.750
you know what I mean?
And we'd go up to the chocolate mountains up to,
um,
uh,

945
00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:58.460
bill wells and stuff like that for ambushes and just,
you know what I mean?

946
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.550
We had an old camp.
There wasn't no camp there.
Psiphon,
Psiphon,

947
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.890
what was that cipher?
I can't remember the siphon that I don't know.

948
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:09.540
I mean all along that whole area.
In fact,
later on,
whereas amplitude,

949
00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.400
if we'd be going to chuck mountains,

950
00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:15.900
come back some other way and you'd still see holes were 40 Mike Mike had went

951
00:56:15.901 --> 00:56:19.020
into and stuff,
you know,
from back in the how much,

952
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:22.710
how much work were you doing at night?
Oh,
that's all.
The only time we weren't,

953
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:26.770
we do our immediate action drills and stuff during the day and stuff,

954
00:56:26.771 --> 00:56:30.790
but all of our ambushes and all the other field craft that we did and everything

955
00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:32.680
was all at night because that's when it worked.

956
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:36.860
<v 0>And that was the,
that was the known thing.
It was like,
Yep,</v>

957
00:56:36.861 --> 00:56:39.350
we're going to go out at night.
That's what we do.
Pretty much.
Yeah.

958
00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.220
How much did you guys,
did you guys go out if there was a full moon,

959
00:56:43.221 --> 00:56:44.870
would you go out less in Vietnam?

960
00:56:44.871 --> 00:56:48.500
Would you go out less if there's a full moon because you didn't fully June
stuff,

961
00:56:48.501 --> 00:56:50.780
you couldn't see that.
Well it was still dark enough.

962
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:54.090
Cause sometimes there's a desert,
a full moon.
It's almost like data.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

963
00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.880
yeah.
And what you know,

964
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.300
you're talking about gear a little bit and what you carried and there's all

965
00:57:02.301 --> 00:57:05.780
these kind of myths about what guys were doing back in the day.

966
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.110
And in Vietnam one of them is blue jeans.

967
00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.410
Like everyone wore blue jeans or a lot,
a lot of guys wore blue jeans,

968
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.310
which kind of makes sense to me because they're tough.
Right.

969
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.820
<v 3>That was the whole reason was that mosquitoes wouldn't go through them.</v>

970
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.360
And if you're in mangrove and stuff it wouldn't tear him and stuff.

971
00:57:22.361 --> 00:57:26.620
Ripstop would tear.
And if you've been down like when you stopped and stuff,

972
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:29.860
excuse me,
each of live right to the rip stuff and stuff.

973
00:57:29.861 --> 00:57:34.861
So we started wearing the blue jeans and you wanted to get zip up blue jeans,

974
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:37.840
not the button up cause they also kept leeches.

975
00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.960
If you had the button button button up ones you were screwed.

976
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:45.040
And then sometimes we wore panty hose underneath that to keep leaches office.

977
00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:50.050
But we'd take the Levi's and put them into our jungle boots and riggers tape

978
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:52.240
them around.
So,
you know,
we did,

979
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:55.390
it wouldn't just be hanging down where shit could come up and stuff.

980
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:59.230
There were a lot of leeches over there.
No big thing.
But I mean you just,

981
00:57:59.231 --> 00:58:01.720
you just learned,
you know.
And like I said,
the penny hose,

982
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:05.950
it's pretty funny cause when we were on see float guys would be walking around

983
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:10.951
with pink and blue and yellow pantyhose on and stuff and sailors are given us

984
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:15.310
kind of some weird looks and shit.
You know,
it's kind of funny.

985
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:16.990
How about guys going barefoot?

986
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:22.290
Well we had a couple guys that do that and guys stepped on stuff and a injured

987
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:23.650
themselves and that,
uh,

988
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:27.760
I didn't see that very much at all myself in my platoons.

989
00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.850
Maybe other proteins or tell you.
Yeah,
that was a big thing.

990
00:58:30.851 --> 00:58:33.280
But a lot of times we don't walk on trails.

991
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:37.840
We walked outside of the trails and then there's all kinds of shit in there and

992
00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:40.060
you don't want to,
uh,
just be bare for it,
I guarantee.

993
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:44.560
<v 0>Yeah.
So you get done with that,
um,</v>

994
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:48.200
workup and everything.
How about,
how about like your,
your,

995
00:58:48.201 --> 00:58:52.910
you are pick gunner hired stories about guys taking every round out of their

996
00:58:52.911 --> 00:58:55.920
belt and lubing every individual round.
Especially stone.

997
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.600
I heard that about stoner gunners that they'd take every round out of their belt

998
00:58:59.601 --> 00:59:03.970
and lube every individual round and put it back in there.
Is that not true?
I've

999
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:05.300
<v 3>never seen that happen.</v>

1000
00:59:05.301 --> 00:59:09.310
And then we had four guys that carried the stoner machine gun and my last

1001
00:59:09.311 --> 00:59:13.180
platoon.
But uh,
I don't know why you'd take him out and put them back in.

1002
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:16.180
They jammed a lot,
but that was just a stoner thing.

1003
00:59:16.181 --> 00:59:19.090
We send our guys to a Cadillac Gage,

1004
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.070
which is who made the stoner so they can learn all the

1005
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.300
<v 1>intricacies and,
and uh,
what to do if something happened,
you know what I mean?</v>

1006
00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:30.680
But the pink gun,
the 60 didn't have to worry about it that much.

1007
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:33.740
As long as you took care of that baby,
it did work for you.

1008
00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:38.150
The only time we ever had a malfunction was operator error.
You know,

1009
00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:43.370
like having a slide down your arm and then you get a link stuck in there or

1010
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:47.540
you're shooting it and year you have your doo rag around your neck and it gets

1011
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:48.560
caught and started dragging

1012
00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:53.400
things you learn.
You know,

1013
00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.390
<v 0>I don't know who told me the little one,</v>

1014
00:59:55.391 --> 01:00:00.220
little one of Vietnam a seals told me this story that like you had the,

1015
01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.190
the um,
he had,

1016
01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.320
he was a stoner gunner and when he came back he checked in his weapon and he was

1017
01:00:07.331 --> 01:00:10.390
going and joining another platoon.
So he went to get,
uh,
a new stoner.

1018
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.540
We're not a new stoner,
but one of the stoners out of the armory.
And he got,

1019
01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.840
went and checked the stone around of the armory and all engraved in the

1020
01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:21.220
buttstock of the stoner.
It said everybody must get stoned,

1021
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:27.070
<v 1>which I always got a good kick out.
It could have been no,
it was a,</v>

1022
01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.230
but that 60,
it was just,
um,
and you developed exactly,
uh,

1023
01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.840
like my basic loaders,
about six 30,

1024
01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.730
because we had 130 a round box and we had China Lake made.

1025
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.680
That goes,
went right on the side of it and we slung it,
you know,

1026
01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:46.690
on the shot from the hip.
But after shooting thousands of rounds from,

1027
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.651
from the hip,

1028
01:00:47.651 --> 01:00:50.960
you get really good eye to barrel coordination of exactly where they're round

1029
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.080
was going to go.
But even regardless,

1030
01:00:53.081 --> 01:00:58.060
you always worked at the end because it wasn't a uh,
excuse me,

1031
01:00:58.061 --> 01:01:01.110
a point weapon like a m 14,
you know,
it was a,

1032
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.210
it's an area weapon but still you can get pretty accurate with that son of a

1033
01:01:04.211 --> 01:01:09.211
bitch and you always walk you around Jim because Wa rounds get Shane off kid hit

1034
01:01:09.851 --> 01:01:14.500
a guy just as well as get him right square in the chest or something.
And um,

1035
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:19.800
I use canteen pouches and carried a five campaign canteen pouches around my

1036
01:01:21.671 --> 01:01:26.671
waist and I put a hundred rounds in there and leave about an inch out of that.

1037
01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:31.720
Got It.
Then when I would fire and I knew I was getting low pop,

1038
01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:35.740
my little on my uh,
can,
I had grabbed my,
uh,

1039
01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:41.070
thing of my 60 rounds snap men and dump them in and close it or the lid when it

1040
01:01:41.861 --> 01:01:45.310
opened up,
had ridges on the side and it would slide right in.
Just dependent,

1041
01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:46.090
you know.

1042
01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:50.020
But what was good about that box as you could be blown upside down or anything

1043
01:01:50.021 --> 01:01:52.210
and still have that hundred and 30 rounds are ready to shoot.

1044
01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.300
You know what I mean?
That's why we liked it.
But this place,
uh,
it was then,

1045
01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.920
it's a navy experimental place called China Lake,
can we,

1046
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.980
so we had them build them for us and they worked really well.

1047
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:04.840
Did you use a sling?
Yeah.

1048
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:08.140
[inaudible] what we did is we took the big bud played off,

1049
01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:11.280
put an aircraft I played on and if you knew us in the back,

1050
01:02:11.281 --> 01:02:12.460
you have that round thing that,

1051
01:02:12.461 --> 01:02:17.461
and we'd take a hook to see that bringing it up and took a hanger and made it

1052
01:02:17.591 --> 01:02:19.980
down rule like this.
And I it around the front of the

1053
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.140
<v 3>hangar.
So you could take it off when you're in a chopper,</v>

1054
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:25.170
she can hold it down and then you can take it off,
put it on.

1055
01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:27.810
But you got to fit just right where it was just right,

1056
01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:30.680
exactly where you wanted to do.
And it worked great.
You know,

1057
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.050
we were invented flux man.
We figured it out,
you know,

1058
01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:39.390
like we was on this one bolt one time and we saw these uh,
60 guys.

1059
01:02:39.391 --> 01:02:41.940
They were,
uh,
they had sixties and the bolts,
you know,

1060
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:46.550
and they had these big metal containers that the rounds when and where to let

1061
01:02:46.551 --> 01:02:49.440
them in it.
Then it was a flex tube that went into the 16.

1062
01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:51.480
So a couple of gay bars later,

1063
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:55.410
we walked off with a couple of those and they were fit perfect in the back of a

1064
01:02:55.411 --> 01:02:57.870
brick 77 a backpack.

1065
01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:00.960
We can put them on held 500 rounds.

1066
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.640
And you had the flex tube that went right into your 60.

1067
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.720
You had to have a special feed Tori for them.
You know what I mean?

1068
01:03:07.721 --> 01:03:11.940
It would feed trade the uh,
the feed tray was right on the end of the flex tube.

1069
01:03:11.941 --> 01:03:14.510
So it's set right in there.
Perfect.
So,

1070
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.570
and then if we're doing an off the chopper charged a bunker off,

1071
01:03:18.571 --> 01:03:21.870
you had to have 500 rounds right there.
And it was kind of neat.

1072
01:03:21.871 --> 01:03:25.560
We're the only ones Vietnam that he had that in fact we came off choppers one

1073
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:29.300
time.
We're doing parakeet ops.
I tell you about that later in,
uh,

1074
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:32.810
there was a whole bunch army guides and stuff where we landed with the choppers

1075
01:03:32.811 --> 01:03:33.461
that are getting off,

1076
01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:37.320
beaten each other on the back and a couple of good firefighters and Shit,

1077
01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:40.200
you know,
and just another quarter light coming up and everything.

1078
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.190
We're all bearded and you know,
Levi's and the,
all that shit.
Nah,

1079
01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:45.690
they're saying God damn.

1080
01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:50.370
I told you I had mercenaries over here was a mercenaries and one guy says and

1081
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:53.040
all that seals.
So you guys,

1082
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:56.340
you guys are the originators of the Predator pack pretty much I think.

1083
01:03:56.341 --> 01:03:59.810
I think we were,
they use them on the bolts but not on a,
not out in the field.

1084
01:03:59.811 --> 01:04:02.520
And you couldn't control it and I have to feed it.
No,

1085
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.810
if fed itself itself right on the bottom of that folder,
no,
nothing.

1086
01:04:06.811 --> 01:04:08.250
It just right through there.

1087
01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:12.420
But you gotta be careful because if you took that thing off and laid it down and

1088
01:04:12.421 --> 01:04:16.740
didn't put a nail through the,
uh,
through the flex part of it all,

1089
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:17.820
your rounded come out.

1090
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.930
So they have this big pile of underground that's not good,
you know,

1091
01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:25.410
especially if he's in a firefight and stuff,
trying to put it back in,
you know,

1092
01:04:25.411 --> 01:04:29.130
I'm just saying just funny,
but it was a,
it was pretty good.

1093
01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:33.690
Me and a guy named two of us had those and we fixed them up just,

1094
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.960
just playing,
looking at and thinking,
hmm.

1095
01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.500
But you couldn't patrol at night with them on patrol because they would go
clank,

1096
01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:41.940
clank.
You could hear her in my move.

1097
01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:46.000
And that was only if you're actually going off and hip and sub.
Like you say,

1098
01:04:46.001 --> 01:04:50.220
there was three types of ops we'd go into if we were going to take care of
these.

1099
01:04:50.221 --> 01:04:53.070
One was a downed pilot and um,
uh,

1100
01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:56.640
another seal platoon in trouble and a bright light was bright light.

1101
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:59.790
That's a prisoner of war going into hit there and get them out.

1102
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.340
But those three ops are the main,
main three woody went into no matter what.

1103
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:09.750
Yeah.
That's awesome.
Um,
you get,

1104
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.600
so you finish your workup and

1105
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.860
now you're over,
you go.
Your first deployment of Vietnam was this key low.
Yeah.

1106
01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.680
Kido Caleb

1107
01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.870
<v 0>tune Vietnam.</v>

1108
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:24.310
And you're saying you were doing the first podcast,

1109
01:05:24.311 --> 01:05:26.260
you were saying that you did dart board operations,

1110
01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:30.610
which was have a guy huck a dark cause you guys that didn't have good intel,

1111
01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:31.863
you didn't have good

1112
01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:32.863
<v 3>what we were,</v>

1113
01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:38.290
we were at a place called [inaudible] and it was a Vietnamese Firebase out in

1114
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.990
BFE gypped,
you know,
and uh,
we are here.

1115
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.230
Then down here you had the river and see flow where other squad was.

1116
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.140
But our squad got put up here.
That was

1117
01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:52.070
<v 0>so just one squad out there by itself.
Yeah.
Oh Dang.
With the vid Vietnamese guys,</v>

1118
01:05:52.071 --> 01:05:55.730
they had a fire base here and there was not good intel.

1119
01:05:55.731 --> 01:05:58.970
So you basically would throw a dart at the dart board and then do what?

1120
01:05:58.971 --> 01:06:01.640
Go do an ambush,
their go set an ambush,
basically go out and look,

1121
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.870
set up ambush or something and see what was out there and patrol.
Yeah.

1122
01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:09.800
And that then you also were inserting primarily on,

1123
01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:11.060
on sand pans during that time.

1124
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:12.720
<v 3>It pretty much other ways.</v>

1125
01:06:12.721 --> 01:06:16.830
We about three times we walked out of the Firebase and walked back in and that's

1126
01:06:16.831 --> 01:06:19.200
just,
that doesn't give you a warm and fuzzy,
you know,

1127
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:23.730
cause a change guards and stuff and you come back in all Lacey's moving out

1128
01:06:23.731 --> 01:06:27.840
there and maybe they don't know what the [inaudible] is for your coming back in

1129
01:06:27.841 --> 01:06:30.520
and shit.
And you know what I'm saying?
So yeah,

1130
01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.690
we didn't do a lot up at new NAM can because of that.

1131
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.550
And we only had sand pants.

1132
01:06:35.551 --> 01:06:39.330
We didn't have any of our bolts up there and none of the mediums or lights or

1133
01:06:39.331 --> 01:06:44.220
anything.
So,
uh,
after we'd been up there for about a month,

1134
01:06:44.221 --> 01:06:45.510
I think month and a half.

1135
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:49.920
Then they brought us maybe two months and then they brought us down to see float

1136
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:51.160
and then we start doing something

1137
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:55.330
<v 0>good ops down there.
How big is the sand pack?
How many guys could you fit in it?</v>

1138
01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:00.570
<v 3>Oh four or five.
So you take two band fans cause we were heavy.
Yeah.</v>

1139
01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:05.140
Wouldn't take 2 cents to sand pants if you ever gotten into a sampan no,

1140
01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.620
they're not a real stable.
Both

1141
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.640
Vietnamese are good to them because they're small.

1142
01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.930
But you get about five big Americans in there and it's a,

1143
01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.510
you have to be real careful.
And Are you rowing it?
No.

1144
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.640
It's got a little motor on the back.
Yeah.

1145
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.550
The little lights that of Ghana with us.

1146
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:26.910
We can put it along with it wasn't just herself,
you know,
and then,

1147
01:07:26.911 --> 01:07:29.160
and then someone who had stayed with the boats.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1148
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:32.970
The going to come back and get us,
you know,

1149
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:38.590
<v 0>but you didn't start working a lot until you got to see flow and what kind of</v>

1150
01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:39.700
ops we do now.
See Float,

1151
01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:44.530
<v 3>no,
same thing,
uh,
uh,
ambushes and going up wherever,
setting up ambushes.</v>

1152
01:07:44.531 --> 01:07:47.030
And that's when I told you I think it would,
you know,

1153
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:50.300
I get a little bit confused sometimes on pbrs and swept.

1154
01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.350
I'm thinking they were pbrs that we're down to the seafloor with us,

1155
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:54.610
but they would,
uh,

1156
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:59.530
we'd go up on the PBR and have a Boston whaler where this in a Boston winter can

1157
01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:01.510
probably hold four or five guys,
you know,

1158
01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:06.490
plus the guy on the front with a 60 and a girl.
The guy driving it.
Well,

1159
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.940
the way we had worked at us,
we had the whole platoon there.
One platoon,

1160
01:08:09.941 --> 01:08:13.510
it'd be going to do something.
Well,
two guys out of the other,

1161
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:18.570
I mean a one squad go up and two guys from the other squad luckily got to pick

1162
01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:23.510
to be the uh,
driver sitting up on a thing driving the,

1163
01:08:23.511 --> 01:08:27.440
uh,
the uh,
uh,
Boston Weiner and the other guy in the 60s,

1164
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:30.860
while everybody else was just looking over the edge like this and it didn't get

1165
01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:35.360
your,
again,
it wasn't,
you didn't get real excited when you were chosen to be the,

1166
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.020
uh,
the Coxen,
you know,

1167
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:40.820
<v 0>how often would you guys make enemy contact when you guys go out on ambush?</v>

1168
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:44.180
Cause I had to be kind of like looking for a needle in a haystack,
right?
Yeah,

1169
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:45.014
we do

1170
01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:47.170
<v 3>got some contact.</v>

1171
01:08:47.171 --> 01:08:50.110
That was the one down in the square bay I told you about when we hit the,

1172
01:08:50.111 --> 01:08:51.460
when I wasn't on that up,

1173
01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:55.310
when they hit that junk and then older mother flares start popping up and they

1174
01:08:55.311 --> 01:08:58.060
realize and,
and a few other times we got into some,
uh,

1175
01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.700
some crap that particular,
that,

1176
01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:06.470
that platoon and that deployment wasn't,

1177
01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.850
we didn't do an awful lot.
We went out a lot or get me wrong,

1178
01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:11.980
but we didn't get in a lot of firefights and stuff.

1179
01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:15.700
It was my second platoon where we kicked ass.

1180
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.171
<v 0>And it sounds like,</v>

1181
01:09:17.171 --> 01:09:20.140
I mean this is sort of classic and you and I were talking about this earlier

1182
01:09:20.141 --> 01:09:24.730
today.
If you don't have good Intel,
get fifth ambush all day long.

1183
01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.520
<v 3>The float,
we didn't have that good of Intel,
you know,</v>

1184
01:09:27.521 --> 01:09:31.920
and like we didn't have a chief of a platoon.
We had an Lpo and uh,

1185
01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:35.910
no mention of any names,
but he wasn't real good.

1186
01:09:35.911 --> 01:09:39.100
But we had this other guy that chief Korman had told her,
I'm not cheap at that.

1187
01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:43.220
A corpsman,
it was a first class and he kind of took over everything.

1188
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:47.450
He had been with the Marines twice to Vietnam.
So he was a good hand,

1189
01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.373
you know what I mean?

1190
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:52.870
Had a shift together with smart and just a couple of funny things happened when

1191
01:09:52.871 --> 01:09:53.840
it was down in the sea floor.

1192
01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:58.290
I told you where that pilot of close moved and stuck to set up all you're

1193
01:09:58.291 --> 01:10:00.450
looking for me.
We thought we had lost him,
you know,

1194
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:04.740
and that was like the chopper comes in and lands,

1195
01:10:04.741 --> 01:10:07.980
two of them did and one was pretty shot up and door gunner had been hit.

1196
01:10:07.981 --> 01:10:10.560
So they said,
hey,
uh,
anybody want to be a door gunner?

1197
01:10:10.561 --> 01:10:14.870
We got to go back and pick up some other guys.
Well of course as a corpsman.
Yeah,

1198
01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:16.880
I'll go.
So he's in UDTs,

1199
01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:20.760
he throws a flak jacket on the Hellman and takes the door gunner position,

1200
01:10:20.761 --> 01:10:21.030
you know,

1201
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:25.670
and they take off and about half hour later the chopper comes back in and lands

1202
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:29.220
shot up even more hair.
He gets off the,
I mean,
uh,

1203
01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:33.540
he gets off the boat holes,
his helmet down,
takes his flat jog out.
Fuck on.

1204
01:10:33.541 --> 01:10:34.374
Ever do that again.

1205
01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:40.240
<v 0>Yeah,
those,
uh,
we,
when we had,
um,
this guy Kirk colonel,</v>

1206
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:43.390
colonel reader on who's a pilot in Vietnam,

1207
01:10:43.391 --> 01:10:46.930
you flew cobras and Vietnam and a second deployment.
But those guys,

1208
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.380
those pilots in Vietnam,
the helicopter pilots Vietnam's they did not,

1209
01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:53.300
they knew they were going to take grounds.
They just went in anyways.

1210
01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.080
They were bad ass.
Same

1211
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.360
<v 3>as our sea walls.
And the black ponies business,</v>

1212
01:10:57.361 --> 01:11:01.080
he will especially were just unbelievable guys.
You know,

1213
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:06.330
they were just bad ass dude demand and the uh,
and I,

1214
01:11:06.331 --> 01:11:09.060
I told you I wanted story again and I bought that one chopper.

1215
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:12.820
So we're kind of pin down behind this rice die.

1216
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:17.610
We're getting some pretty heavy fire from the uh,
tree lines.

1217
01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:21.570
So we call in for a closer support and it's the sea walls,
you know,

1218
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:25.410
so we're getting up shooting,
getting back down my 60,

1219
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:28.170
and we're getting kind of low on Ammo to except the seawalls.

1220
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:32.400
We always had animals stage on the seawall so he could kick it off to us when

1221
01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:35.850
they came in.
So the seawalls are coming,
we can hear the roller of Walter.

1222
01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.770
Oh well when the sea wolves were doing,

1223
01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:42.780
they were the greatest when they weren't doing a close air support that do psy

1224
01:11:42.781 --> 01:11:45.190
ops,
they had these great big speakers.

1225
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:49.390
So we hear this one sea wolf coming in behind us and we're still shooting

1226
01:11:49.391 --> 01:11:52.720
everything.
All of a sudden out of the clear blue sky,
I swear to God,

1227
01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:56.440
you hear this,
we are,
the gods are hell fire.

1228
01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.700
And we bring you flyer and the fucking rocket went over,

1229
01:11:59.701 --> 01:12:04.701
her head hit the tree line and they either had a 50 or a mini gun on one side of

1230
01:12:04.901 --> 01:12:08.590
the sea wolf and that sea wolf turn like that and just holds the down.

1231
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.800
I think that one had a mini gun on and then right behind and came another seal.

1232
01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:13.700
But when they,
when we heard that we are like,

1233
01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:17.500
everybody just stopped shooting and we looked back up like,
what the fuck?

1234
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:23.110
It was unreal and that's really suppress a fire.

1235
01:12:23.111 --> 01:12:24.160
So then the black bone,

1236
01:12:24.161 --> 01:12:29.161
they had 2.7 rockets and a black ponies came in with a five inch zoomies and

1237
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.660
when they hit the hit the tree line,
it was blown to shit,

1238
01:12:31.661 --> 01:12:35.180
cleaned up over her head and that pretty much quotes to we've done and it'll get

1239
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:35.550
out of there.

1240
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:39.760
Just see lords came in the regular Hueys that picked us up and got us out of

1241
01:12:39.761 --> 01:12:41.290
there.
That was,
that was a good off though.

1242
01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:45.810
The Wolf's where the Navy pilots,

1243
01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:49.780
Navy Vietnam gun ships that came and supported and we're in like cobras.

1244
01:12:49.781 --> 01:12:54.010
They were regular [inaudible] rep with the rocket pods and I think,
uh,

1245
01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:55.330
like the,
uh,

1246
01:12:55.330 --> 01:13:00.330
black ponies had the 20 millimeter guns in the front and then the five inch

1247
01:13:01.031 --> 01:13:03.460
zoomies they had the,
just the rocket pods,

1248
01:13:03.461 --> 01:13:08.060
but they had a 50 on one side and or a,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1249
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.460
mini gun on the other side.

1250
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:13.600
And the most important that they think that they had from everything I've heard

1251
01:13:13.601 --> 01:13:17.350
and from what you're telling me right now is they had balls.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,

1252
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.970
they're good.

1253
01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:22.650
They were just come in and we got drunk one night or bar seawalls are on the

1254
01:13:22.651 --> 01:13:25.800
army side.
That's where they had their thing.
So we figured,
hell,

1255
01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.900
we'll go over and visit him and have him drink with it.

1256
01:13:27.901 --> 01:13:31.500
So we jumped in our six by and headed out.
We were,

1257
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:35.190
they had the army base here and the navy base.
Here we are,

1258
01:13:35.191 --> 01:13:39.560
lived on the Vietnamese side and had her own own very soul to fight.

1259
01:13:39.561 --> 01:13:40.650
It was perfect.
We,
anyway,

1260
01:13:40.651 --> 01:13:45.030
we got an r six pine was heading out when over where the Seawolf guys where we

1261
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:49.110
want to drink with us.
You know,
we had our sixties was stuff you never knew,

1262
01:13:49.111 --> 01:13:52.380
you know,
so we'd get over there and go walk in and their compound everything.

1263
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:54.210
All right boys get up,
let's drink.

1264
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.190
Well see we made them drink or this naked cause we were all naked so we're all

1265
01:13:59.191 --> 01:14:02.200
sitting there drinking beers,
naked

1266
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.050
nakedness and sixties and booze.

1267
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:11.860
I like where this is going.

1268
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:17.080
<v 0>You guys had way much more fun in Vietnam the morning time.
I'm telling you,</v>

1269
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:18.360
we weren't a,
we,

1270
01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.660
we'd get back to a knop dewar debrief cleaner weapons and go up and get shit

1271
01:14:22.661 --> 01:14:26.650
faced.
You know,
criminal readers said the same thing.
He goes,
he goes,
yeah,

1272
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:28.960
you know we'd go out,
we'd fly,
we'd get shot up,

1273
01:14:28.961 --> 01:14:31.510
we'd have to come back and like put the birds in for repair.

1274
01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:34.530
I then we'd get drunk and then we'd go and he goes,
I don't know.

1275
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.700
He really like looked at me and he said,

1276
01:14:36.701 --> 01:14:40.630
I don't know how you guys did it without alcohol.

1277
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.640
Basically you're going to say,
yeah,
that was it.

1278
01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:45.460
<v 3>You know,
went to Desert Storm.</v>

1279
01:14:45.461 --> 01:14:49.480
We were over there nine months and no alcohol and stuff.
It was okay.
But I mean,

1280
01:14:49.481 --> 01:14:52.240
to me it was just like,
yeah,
this isn't my war.
You know,

1281
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.970
we really didn't do that much.
And you know,

1282
01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.930
the guy did recons and stuff from Michelle hub and we did that one deception up

1283
01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:06.610
and uh,
when we inserted the Kuwaitis and that's outside of that,

1284
01:15:06.611 --> 01:15:08.830
they never would have gotten to a firefighter

1285
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:13.360
<v 0>this shit,
you know?
Yeah.
That was,</v>

1286
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:16.810
I'm assuming that was on your second deployment was your first,

1287
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:21.460
your first appointment,
you know,
you did what you did,
but it wasn't as fruitful.

1288
01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:21.960
No,

1289
01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.100
<v 3>I'd get it to me tell you the honest to God truth.
Coming out of 18 to seal team,</v>

1290
01:15:26.101 --> 01:15:29.670
I was ready to hit the deck running and it just seemed like we didn't hit the

1291
01:15:29.671 --> 01:15:34.671
deck running over there and just didn't have the Intel I don't think are,

1292
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.680
as you were saying,
leadership was all that good and stuff.
I mean,
we had one guy,

1293
01:15:40.681 --> 01:15:44.970
the Lt,
they were doing some shit down in sea float,

1294
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:47.910
but if where we were,
we just didn't,
you couldn't,

1295
01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:51.360
it was just wasn't that much you could do,
you would go out and look,

1296
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:53.130
try to find shit and everything,

1297
01:15:53.131 --> 01:15:56.770
but we didn't have actionable intel that we can react on.
You know,

1298
01:15:56.771 --> 01:15:59.010
what you found out later.
That's what you have to have

1299
01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:02.700
<v 0>sometimes too.
I think people spread their forces to thin.</v>

1300
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:03.541
Like you think about it,

1301
01:16:03.541 --> 01:16:06.000
you just take a squad and put them out there in the middle of nowhere with no

1302
01:16:06.001 --> 01:16:09.270
intel support and then you got another squad in some other area with no intel

1303
01:16:09.271 --> 01:16:11.370
support.
You know,
you might as well bring them together,

1304
01:16:11.371 --> 01:16:12.500
put a couple of guys together,

1305
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:16.330
Intel and you start making something happen the platoon before.

1306
01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:18.420
So that was there.
And so that,
uh,
that was

1307
01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:21.590
<v 3>put tune.
Rosie has gotten a lot of shit,
you know what I mean?</v>

1308
01:16:21.591 --> 01:16:24.210
That's when he got his medal of honor and stuff like that.
And uh,

1309
01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:29.280
actually my second trip over had been in that book tune,

1310
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:31.530
you know what I mean?
And told me some stories about it.

1311
01:16:31.531 --> 01:16:36.531
They got in a lot of shit that we were stuck in new NAM can and just didn't well

1312
01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:39.810
shift,
right.
You could see the human force,

1313
01:16:39.811 --> 01:16:44.811
which was at the very southern part of Vietnam and it's just triple canopy.

1314
01:16:44.881 --> 01:16:47.940
Just,
I mean we were away from that a little bit,
you know,

1315
01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.430
but the sole Vietnamese guy there,

1316
01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:54.480
he had tattoos all over and I guess he had fought with the French against the

1317
01:16:54.481 --> 01:16:58.650
Vietnamese Viet men,
you know,
which was the bad guys fighting the French.

1318
01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.340
Same as VC and we're through an interpreter.

1319
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:06.450
We were talking to him and then I got damn human for us,
you know,
that's uh,

1320
01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.580
he says,
yeah,
a whole uh,
uh,

1321
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.860
company of a French Foreign Legion.

1322
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.460
Paratroopers jumped in there and none of them ever came back out.
And we're going

1323
01:17:18.690 --> 01:17:22.370
plus the way I,
that's when I was telling you in my last podcast I did,

1324
01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:25.040
that's where we landed and we're just starting to put her shit away.

1325
01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:29.420
And the sloths lands and it's approved visor and good friend of mine,

1326
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.840
real good friend of mine now.
And then when that loach took off,

1327
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:36.800
we got the ship mortar now for about two hours.
And that's when we told him,

1328
01:17:36.801 --> 01:17:37.240
don't ever

1329
01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.380
<v 0>come here again.
You know,</v>

1330
01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.200
so now when you get back,
you get back,

1331
01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:48.550
you do another workup and well actually you got out for a little bit.

1332
01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:52.660
You come back in,
you decide,
you know,
that's like when I went to college,

1333
01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:55.160
I had to go to,
I had to get my,
once I got my commission,

1334
01:17:55.161 --> 01:17:57.730
I had to go to college and people would say,
oh,
what'd you learn in college?

1335
01:17:57.731 --> 01:18:02.110
And I'd say,
I learned in college,
never,
ever,
ever,
ever get out of the teams ever

1336
01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.200
deal.
So,
uh,
you,

1337
01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:10.630
you get out for a year or something and you come back in and getting your,

1338
01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.600
your second platoon and getting ready to go to Viet.
Was that November platoon?

1339
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.813
Okay.

1340
01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:19.990
<v 3>You're,
he just passed.
And what a great guy.
I mean,
was he the platoon commander?</v>

1341
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:24.070
[inaudible] it die?
We Ot,
you know,
he's a great guy.

1342
01:18:24.071 --> 01:18:28.090
Just a great guy,
man.
He,
uh,
and he just passed here,
uh,

1343
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:32.500
about three weeks ago and we went up and Rosecrans and they buried him and
stuff.

1344
01:18:32.501 --> 01:18:34.060
But he was a great guy,
man.

1345
01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:38.400
<v 0>And that workup,
that workup did,
it did,</v>

1346
01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.600
did much change between your first workup at seal team and your second one

1347
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.870
actually when I got out,

1348
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:48.340
<v 3>only came back in and went back through cadre.
Oh,
okay.</v>

1349
01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:52.150
Just to kind of crush yourself refreshed had been about a year as out,

1350
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:53.890
you know what I mean?
And it just,
it,

1351
01:18:53.891 --> 01:18:58.420
that's the way he did it in [inaudible] if you were gone way over six months or

1352
01:18:58.421 --> 01:18:58.721
something,

1353
01:18:58.721 --> 01:19:02.470
you went back through cadre is to even the guys that came from these coals,

1354
01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.710
you know,
just so they know how we worked in self,
which was good.

1355
01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.420
Why was going through cadre?

1356
01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:11.980
Jury Fletcher was out there with this platoon and they got to know him and uh,

1357
01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:16.300
I knew some of the other guys who have a teen.
So soon as I got out of the cadre,

1358
01:19:16.301 --> 01:19:18.520
they lost a guy in their platoon.
And lucky enough,

1359
01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:20.380
I was good enough to get into it.

1360
01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.910
So I didn't go through the whole workup with November two night,
just got in it.

1361
01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:28.630
And uh,
that's when I was telling you was down at the ream field.

1362
01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:33.400
They used to have a firing range down there.
And,
uh,
I was figuring out,

1363
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:35.790
ma'am,
I shoot something else.
And I,
you know,

1364
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:38.110
that's when I actually asked the first,

1365
01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:40.790
that's when I picked up a 60 me and this guy,
um,

1366
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:47.170
we shot it,
this career,
saw log pieces,
flew off the Curtis whole log,

1367
01:19:47.171 --> 01:19:49.530
and we set it on fire.
And I remember looking at him,

1368
01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:55.210
<v 0>you're looking at me and it was like,
we're in.
So that,
that was it.</v>

1369
01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:59.530
Yeah,
the 60s a beautiful thing.
Oh,
it's a great thing.

1370
01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:05.530
So this next deployment,
and you mentioned this on the,
on the,

1371
01:20:05.531 --> 01:20:08.280
on the first podcast when you came on about the

1372
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:12.270
<v 3>orders that you got from,
was it from Mac resach?</v>

1373
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:13.300
Is that who you're getting orders from?

1374
01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:18.880
Four v Nav for V and we landed in Saigon and Rlt die.

1375
01:20:19.921 --> 01:20:23.380
We went up to,
uh,
to see where we're going to go.
Uh,

1376
01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.240
what area we're going to work in.
What province,
you know,

1377
01:20:27.241 --> 01:20:30.240
and he went up there and they told him,
well you got the Vin long province,

1378
01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:35.220
she is where Dong Tam is and stuff.
And he said,
uh,
his orders were to pacify it.

1379
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:38.580
That was it.
And uh,
we brought,
uh,
he uh,

1380
01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.480
picked up a whole bunch of money so we can pay our kit Carson scouts and stuff

1381
01:20:42.481 --> 01:20:45.900
like that.
And we went to dawn cam.
Well we stopped at Ben.

1382
01:20:45.901 --> 01:20:50.280
Look first it's about 40 miles away from Dong Tam and there was another platoon

1383
01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:52.270
there,
Gary Gallagher's platoon.

1384
01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:56.180
We shows up in her six buys and stuff and we're kind of rugged looking,

1385
01:20:56.181 --> 01:21:00.610
cause we'd been in Saigon for three days and having a good time and shit and

1386
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:03.930
comes walking out and he looks at us,
he goes,
God damn,

1387
01:21:03.931 --> 01:21:06.090
you guys look like you've been here six months already.

1388
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.680
You always little be dragged ode to shit.
Then we went to Dong Tam,

1389
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:15.660
but we used to go back and forth.
I was the Neptune George anger.

1390
01:21:15.661 --> 01:21:18.570
They just had some great guys and they were,
like I said,

1391
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:19.980
they're our sister platoon,
you know.

1392
01:21:19.981 --> 01:21:23.720
So we'd go and see each other once in a while with the sister platoons deployed

1393
01:21:23.721 --> 01:21:26.750
at the same time?
No,
they had been over there for three months.
Okay.

1394
01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:30.630
So was it like a overlap of three months of the platoon?
Some of them,
yeah.

1395
01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:34.500
Two of them may go at the same time.
It usually when you got there,

1396
01:21:34.501 --> 01:21:38.400
there was another platoon somewhere around ya rather east coast or west coast of

1397
01:21:38.401 --> 01:21:41.880
course.
East Coast had two platoons over there.
So fung towel.

1398
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:45.990
I'm thinking it was one cow got,
I'm still trying to think of that name.

1399
01:21:45.991 --> 01:21:49.230
It's a right on a river and that's where the east coast platoon was.
We never,

1400
01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:51.900
not bay,
that's where it was not be.

1401
01:21:52.170 --> 01:21:53.670
And that's where the east coast puts in there.

1402
01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:57.570
They had a platoon there and they had a platoon of Mito and that was their two

1403
01:21:57.571 --> 01:22:00.780
platoons and then we took over.
When they left,

1404
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:03.500
we took over the one that dawn Mito,

1405
01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:07.540
but we moved to Dong Tam because we didn't want to be right in the middle of a

1406
01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.380
city,
you know,
or a big,
big town or a city.

1407
01:22:10.381 --> 01:22:13.950
So we moved down to Dong Tam and then the navy base didn't want us,

1408
01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:15.890
the army base didn't want us to,

1409
01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.750
they put us in the Vietnamese base that split them.
So there you go.
Yeah.

1410
01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:23.040
And that was good.
We had our bolts right there.
Everything was perfectly,

1411
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:26.490
we go to the army base,
the test fire weapons and shit.

1412
01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:29.730
And they were doing that all the time anyway.
So it wasn't,
it's another thing.

1413
01:22:29.731 --> 01:22:32.850
I wonder how can we tell how they test fired their weapons and shit.
Anyway,

1414
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:37.080
so what was your op tempo like when you are on the second deployment?

1415
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:39.390
Deployment was a,
we'd go out about

1416
01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:46.440
every two to three days because you had to gather in tone and stuff like that.

1417
01:22:46.441 --> 01:22:50.040
And uh,
and then we'd get a little break.
And if we were real board,

1418
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:55.080
we'd do what we called parakeet ops.
And,
uh,
there was this area,

1419
01:22:55.081 --> 01:22:57.670
I don't know if I talked about this in the first podcast,

1420
01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:02.890
but it was a place called the plain of reads and it was all enemy as all VC.

1421
01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:06.130
And so we'd take off,
uh,

1422
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.280
four or five of us in a Huey didn't have a seawall from front and in back of us.

1423
01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:15.370
And we just fly out there,
start looking,
go over,

1424
01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:19.690
go over small hamlets and villages and a few CVC run around and get shot at.

1425
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:21.910
They had land us,
we'd sweep through,

1426
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:25.000
then they'd pick us up and we'd go look for some more,
you know,

1427
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:29.980
that's when we were bored,
you know,
we call them parakeets pups.
And then the,
uh,

1428
01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:33.490
when we hit and started spreading around,
the Seawolf would go off.
I mean,

1429
01:23:33.491 --> 01:23:34.750
Not Sea Wolf,
the Sea Lord,

1430
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:37.990
which was our Huey and then the seawalls and start circling,

1431
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:41.050
looking for his quarters and stuff,
you know,
it was good.

1432
01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.730
We might get in two or three firefights you know?

1433
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:48.420
<v 0>Yeah,
I guess that would daytime off.</v>

1434
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:52.790
So you're just running those daytime ops and what you would you just look at the

1435
01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:54.590
map and say,
hey,
this is probably a good spot.

1436
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:59.220
<v 3>Yeah,
the planar reads a whole place,
uh,
strong stronghold,</v>

1437
01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:01.800
VC strong goal,
a lot of VC out there.

1438
01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:04.680
So then that's when,
uh,

1439
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:09.240
we took a couple of the Australian was us on that and those parakeet ops and

1440
01:24:09.241 --> 01:24:10.350
stuff and it blew him out of the way

1441
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:14.110
<v 0>or how they like it that they come back for more.
Oh yeah.</v>

1442
01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.390
We had two groups come down to us than me and

1443
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:21.690
<v 3>well to Nui dat where the Australian they'll us where and when our them and that</v>

1444
01:24:21.691 --> 01:24:23.590
was pretty,
pretty unique.
Yeah.

1445
01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:29.780
My 60 and route 500 rounds in 120 pound pack and walked around for about eight

1446
01:24:31.951 --> 01:24:36.440
days.
I was real happy about that.
It was good.
They were,

1447
01:24:36.441 --> 01:24:38.850
they were great troops and uh,
you know,

1448
01:24:38.851 --> 01:24:42.350
they loved coming down and working with us because we got contact and uh,

1449
01:24:42.690 --> 01:24:46.290
when they,
you know,
they're,
they look for things to see if,
what they could find.

1450
01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.310
They have two types of things.
They had a five man fighting patrol or a 10,

1451
01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:55.260
I mean a five man Ricky or a 10 men fighting patrol.
When we went out with him,

1452
01:24:55.261 --> 01:24:59.700
it was a 10 men fighting patrol cause we're going to go into this area that the

1453
01:24:59.701 --> 01:25:03.120
Australian armored infantry had taken over this,
uh,
north,

1454
01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:08.140
the Nva north Vietnamese army base camp and then just decimated it.

1455
01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.300
Well,

1456
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:13.850
our job was to go see if any of the Nva had moved back into the area or none.

1457
01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.080
It was good.
The best.
Like I said,

1458
01:25:16.081 --> 01:25:20.100
my first podcast is the best reconnaissance guys I've ever,
ever worked with.

1459
01:25:20.101 --> 01:25:23.550
And their fighters too.
They're good,
good,
good,
good troops.

1460
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:27.650
<v 0>Yeah.
For some reason a lot of people ask me if you've ever worked with foreign</v>

1461
01:25:27.651 --> 01:25:27.951
troops,

1462
01:25:27.951 --> 01:25:32.210
everyone want to con kind of wants to know what we think of their countries and

1463
01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:33.920
their troops,
you know,
and uh,
you know,

1464
01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:37.910
the Brits and the Aussies vsts or top kill for sure.

1465
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:39.480
The only ones that went out,

1466
01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:42.130
<v 3>well,
those on patrol and I think we're in Vietnam.</v>

1467
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:44.860
We were the only ones that went out with them.
You know,

1468
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:50.080
it all started out with a couple of SAS guys drinking in a bar with a couple of

1469
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:54.640
our guys and pooper pats and tell him tall tales and you know,

1470
01:25:54.641 --> 01:25:56.530
drinking beers and shit and next thing you know,

1471
01:25:56.531 --> 01:25:58.340
we had this exchange and it's been

1472
01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:01.630
<v 0>ongoing attendance.
Yeah.
Always.
When I was a team one,</v>

1473
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:06.350
there was always a SAS guy there.
Yeah.
Did you or did you,
when you went to go,

1474
01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:09.200
did you get to go to Australia?
Never went.
No.
Oh,
you'd love it.

1475
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.400
It's great.
I always got a,

1476
01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:17.420
I always got screwed out of going Australia five times after Vietnam and hill.

1477
01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:20.640
There was show guys there that had been to Vietnam with from yesterday.
Sas.

1478
01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:23.420
You know what I mean?
It was good.
It was great.
Yeah.

1479
01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:26.920
I always got screwed for some reason.
I'd always go,
wow,
yeah,

1480
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:27.831
we're going to go to Australia.

1481
01:26:27.831 --> 01:26:29.930
And some something will come up when we wouldn't get to go.

1482
01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:33.590
That's because your platoon officer wasn't very well liked or something?

1483
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:38.780
Most likely.
What?
Uh,
when you said you were getting contacted a lot,

1484
01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:40.730
so you're doing an app every two,
three days.

1485
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:43.850
How often are you guys getting an enemy contact?

1486
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.823
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1487
01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:50.870
<v 3>Jeff thought every time we went out because we were going out on actionable</v>

1488
01:26:50.871 --> 01:26:54.890
intel,
you know what I mean?
And uh,
shit,
I can't think of all of it.

1489
01:26:54.891 --> 01:26:58.510
Like at one time I was telling you and another time we hit these two who,

1490
01:26:58.710 --> 01:27:03.280
and guys came out,
it was like the OK corral except we won.
And um,

1491
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.350
another time where it's doing this re conscious looking and this one guy,
um,

1492
01:27:10.530 --> 01:27:14.400
or gets up on top of this bunker because we couldn't find any entrance around
it.

1493
01:27:14.401 --> 01:27:17.610
They may have had a tunnel coming into it somewhere and he's up there and I'm

1494
01:27:17.611 --> 01:27:18.690
standing here in this guy,
right?

1495
01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.900
She has a sixties there and we're kind of watching the area for him while he's

1496
01:27:22.901 --> 01:27:27.730
up there looking around and Q and Q and tune tune right by me comes as AK 47

1497
01:27:27.731 --> 01:27:32.230
rounds in the miss me.
I don't know how the hell they miss me,
but uh,
then,
uh,

1498
01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:38.220
jumps off the,
the bunker down right beside me and yeah,
just gone.
Yeah.

1499
01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:40.370
The guys over there,
that guys over there and meet her,

1500
01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.440
hear yelling and we'll shoot the son of a bitch.

1501
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.610
Finally we saw where his rounds came in and we started shooting and another time

1502
01:27:46.611 --> 01:27:51.560
we got pinned down a little bit and we were going to go in and hit this a check

1503
01:27:51.561 --> 01:27:52.850
this hospital out and stuff.

1504
01:27:52.851 --> 01:27:56.570
When we got hit pretty hard and we had a pullback and now move out.

1505
01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:58.700
That might've been when we got pinned down,
you know?

1506
01:27:59.000 --> 01:27:59.330
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1507
01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:01.640
<v 0>Oh,
is that when you called them the seawalls?
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

1508
01:28:01.930 --> 01:28:04.300
We called them and a few times,
you know?
Yeah.
No,
it's,

1509
01:28:04.301 --> 01:28:08.110
it's interesting because people think that every time you go out you're going to

1510
01:28:08.111 --> 01:28:10.950
get any me contact and you could see,
I mean,
your first appointment,
yeah.

1511
01:28:10.951 --> 01:28:13.360
It was rare that you'd get enemy contact does the second time.

1512
01:28:13.361 --> 01:28:17.290
It's a lot more often.
Yeah.
Like my first deployment to Iraq,
we got like,

1513
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:19.420
I don't know,
like four or five firefights maybe.

1514
01:28:19.690 --> 01:28:22.960
And they were all pretty like not,
not really a big deal.

1515
01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.760
And then when I was a troop commander,
Normani did,

1516
01:28:25.761 --> 01:28:29.930
the platoons were getting into it.
All the guy I know almost every,
not every,

1517
01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:33.850
almost every,
but a lot of the times,
I mean,
a majority of the times there'd be,

1518
01:28:33.851 --> 01:28:35.790
there'd be shooting going on,
you know?
Yeah.

1519
01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:38.700
<v 3>Carrie,
you,
I've talked to a lot of guys that were in your platoon,</v>

1520
01:28:38.701 --> 01:28:40.700
in Ramadi and they,
uh,

1521
01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.420
they had follow you to the [inaudible] the hell if they had her,
they loved you.

1522
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:49.340
So just letting you know you had a real good impression and you,

1523
01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:53.640
you were outstanding just telling you that.
That's for my guy,
you know,

1524
01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:57.570
talking to the guys on the ground drinking and stuff.
When your name comes up,

1525
01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:58.673
you know,

1526
01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.920
<v 0>well,
they're drunk.
I guess that's,
that's the reason I'm just showing it.</v>

1527
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.610
It's like,
you know,
you know,
well those guys were,
those guys.

1528
01:29:05.611 --> 01:29:09.020
Did those guys actually,
nevermind.
They would,
they did,
they,

1529
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:13.530
they did all kinds of stuff that was above way above and beyond the call of duty

1530
01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:17.740
for sure.
And uh,
God bless you.
Took it to them and that's what,

1531
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:21.170
that's what you're supposed to do,
you know?
Yeah.
It was,
uh,
it was,
uh,

1532
01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:23.930
it was an awesome deployment.
Awesome deployment and forth,

1533
01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.320
working with awesome guys for sure.

1534
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.490
<v 3>We went out one time and uh,
we heard there was this cashier,
you know,
so,</v>

1535
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:32.430
but we did want people to know they were going out there.

1536
01:29:32.431 --> 01:29:37.431
So we got into a refrigerator truck and hitting the back of that until they got

1537
01:29:38.071 --> 01:29:42.030
close to where the cache was and we went out and dug it up and came back.

1538
01:29:42.031 --> 01:29:43.260
Just little things,
you know what I mean?

1539
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:47.990
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
That was a neat off.
Yeah.
That's uh,</v>

1540
01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:53.750
that it's good stuff when,
um,
when you get back from that deployment,

1541
01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:58.010
and that was the last November,
when was the last fully deployed to Vietnam?
Yeah.

1542
01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:58.911
Did you didn't get any,

1543
01:29:58.911 --> 01:30:00.800
you didn't go back to sue beck when you were a seal platoon?

1544
01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:04.590
Did you know that was like,
no,
you can stay there the whole time.
Yeah.

1545
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:09.280
<v 3>Did get two weeks or a week or two weeks?
I think of rnr and uh,</v>

1546
01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.570
I think I went to Hawaii.

1547
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:13.320
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1548
01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:16.830
<v 0>And Thailand one time.
So supports your choice of going to Hawaii.</v>

1549
01:30:16.831 --> 01:30:20.580
He's from Hawaii.
So Hawaii is the bad.
Nope.

1550
01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.980
That's kind of weird though.
Go into Hawaiian.

1551
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:26.630
<v 3>Everything is all quiet and peaceful and everything and you just come out of the</v>

1552
01:30:26.631 --> 01:30:29.880
woods and you know,
after you'd been there for a while you're,
you,

1553
01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:31.800
you kind of want to go back.
You know what I mean?

1554
01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:35.350
<v 0>I don't know.
If I went to Thailand,</v>

1555
01:30:35.351 --> 01:30:38.350
I probably would've stayed in Thailand has still been there now and I'd probably

1556
01:30:38.351 --> 01:30:42.760
be dead.
It gives a lot of people that go to Thailand and don't come back.

1557
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:45.780
Bangkok makes the hard man humble can guarantee you

1558
01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:51.220
did a,
I remember last time we talked about this blue on blue that you guys had,

1559
01:30:51.221 --> 01:30:55.390
was that in November we'll tune?
No,
that was in kilos and kilos.

1560
01:30:57.490 --> 01:30:58.350
<v 3>No,
it was our,</v>

1561
01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:03.430
the officer that was with us up in a new NAM can and that was like you said,

1562
01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:08.070
was supposed to be an air hammer and anvil off.
It just went wrong.
Yeah.
And I,

1563
01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:09.530
I'm not sure if he was,
uh,

1564
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:13.720
stood up to shoot or if he was trying to wave and tell them to stop shooting.

1565
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:16.340
Anyway,
he got hit,
you know,
killed him.
So,

1566
01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:19.730
and then we almost had another in November platoon,

1567
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.170
or you forgot to mention this.

1568
01:31:21.171 --> 01:31:23.840
So we're hitting this island and it's not a big island,

1569
01:31:23.841 --> 01:31:25.850
but it had hooches all along one side.

1570
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:30.770
So they wanted us to go through and check out the hooches and we had what we

1571
01:31:30.771 --> 01:31:34.250
called white mice with us.
They were Vietnamese Intel guys.

1572
01:31:34.251 --> 01:31:39.020
I could look through things and find out if there's any VC stuff,

1573
01:31:39.021 --> 01:31:42.770
you know what I mean?
So thing.
So we lands and were sweeping through it.

1574
01:31:42.771 --> 01:31:47.030
And I had this one white mice with me and I had my 61 of the guy that

1575
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:54.270
plan this hop and thought it was a good idea was our debt golf guy and the debt

1576
01:31:54.441 --> 01:31:57.160
golf was your senior seal,
was that Def Golf?

1577
01:31:57.161 --> 01:32:02.010
And he was kind of in charge of all the other ever spread out.
And um,

1578
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:06.820
so we did it and he was with us and his interpreter.
So,

1579
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:10.450
and we were told everybody stay on this side when we patrol,

1580
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:14.260
because anything on the left side is a free fire zone.
Right?

1581
01:32:14.710 --> 01:32:17.780
So we're walking along and I'm looking at it,
the woods and I'll say,

1582
01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.850
see this Flint and through the woods.
So I bring my 60 up,

1583
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:24.940
take it off as safe and I'm watching,
well where the woods,

1584
01:32:24.941 --> 01:32:28.780
where there was a space and then another part of the woods where I wanted the VC

1585
01:32:28.781 --> 01:32:32.920
who I thought it was to get out in the space.
And then at hammering,
you know,

1586
01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:35.290
open up with my 60 and a,

1587
01:32:35.291 --> 01:32:38.200
we're spread out a little bit because everybody was checking different things

1588
01:32:38.201 --> 01:32:40.600
out as we're going along.
So I had it off safe.

1589
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.950
I'm just have laid it up on this a rice or rice bag,
you know,

1590
01:32:44.951 --> 01:32:47.530
with Rice on it and just waiting who comes out.

1591
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:52.930
But the lieutenant commander,
the Ted Golf Guy,
I was so fucking pissed.

1592
01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.750
If I had been a new guy,
I'd open up,
you know what I mean?

1593
01:32:55.751 --> 01:32:57.760
Maybe killed him and a thing.

1594
01:32:57.761 --> 01:33:01.690
So I told Jerry Fletcher my auntie about it and he never went out with us again

1595
01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.260
because that was crazy.
He was under the free fire zone,
you know what I mean?

1596
01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:08.450
And like you say,
what if I'd been a brand new guy or something new,

1597
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:09.940
but I wanted to wait til he got out.

1598
01:33:09.941 --> 01:33:12.660
So I had a clear picture before I opened up on him.

1599
01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:16.250
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean even your mindset wasn't even,
let me confirm this as a bad guy.</v>

1600
01:33:16.251 --> 01:33:19.270
You knew it was a bad guy.
You were just waiting for the him the,

1601
01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.090
<v 3>I wasn't saying that he,
that might be one of our guys.</v>

1602
01:33:22.091 --> 01:33:26.300
I knew it was a bad guy because we had already briefed heavily,

1603
01:33:26.630 --> 01:33:28.910
everybody stay on this side and anybody over there.

1604
01:33:28.911 --> 01:33:30.290
And you see them open up on them.

1605
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:34.850
<v 0>You know,
when I was running training man I,
I worked those guys,</v>

1606
01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:37.880
they would have blue and blue is all the time in training.

1607
01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:42.710
I mean we would just make stuff so confusing and just put the enemy in the wrong

1608
01:33:42.711 --> 01:33:44.240
place and get guys confused.

1609
01:33:44.241 --> 01:33:47.900
I wanted them to have blue on blues and training so they realized how easy it is

1610
01:33:47.901 --> 01:33:51.050
to happen.
So you get a guy instead of making that decision like,
oh,
I'll just,

1611
01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:51.471
you know what,

1612
01:33:51.471 --> 01:33:54.050
there's probably get a good vantage point over here if I just walk over here and

1613
01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:56.570
they'll know it's me.
You know?
It's like,
no,
they won't know what you,

1614
01:33:56.571 --> 01:34:00.200
they'll kill you.
So yeah,
it's a man you got to,

1615
01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:03.770
people don't understand how confusing it gets out there,
man.
It gets confusing.

1616
01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.930
<v 3>That's where you're training and you're like,
I was telling you though,</v>

1617
01:34:07.931 --> 01:34:08.764
it saved our butts.

1618
01:34:08.770 --> 01:34:12.700
Vietnam was there immediate action drills and they have them so ingrained into

1619
01:34:12.701 --> 01:34:14.020
us that it's dark.

1620
01:34:14.021 --> 01:34:16.630
You know exactly where the guy is going to be and what you're going to do,

1621
01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:19.990
whether it's a peel off or whether you're going to the right or left.

1622
01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:23.680
You know what I mean?
Getting out of the,
uh,
the fire zone,
whatever,

1623
01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:26.140
you know what I mean?
But you had to have that man,

1624
01:34:26.141 --> 01:34:30.430
that was immediate action drills to me are the key no matter what you're doing,

1625
01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:33.570
whether it's urban or I think,
which I can't really,

1626
01:34:33.810 --> 01:34:36.640
<v 0>no,
it's the same thing.
The same thing in an urban environment.</v>

1627
01:34:36.641 --> 01:34:37.640
You got to have a mediator.

1628
01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:42.150
<v 3>Say you have a hooch there and you're going to hit the hooch,
you know,</v>

1629
01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:45.510
we know there's probably bad guys in it.
And then we're coming in.

1630
01:34:45.690 --> 01:34:49.980
What we do is two guys to branch out to the right or left to get anybody from

1631
01:34:49.981 --> 01:34:51.960
behind.
The restaurant would go in,

1632
01:34:51.961 --> 01:34:55.650
one guy would turn around and look that way and the guys would go in and that

1633
01:34:55.651 --> 01:34:59.650
way they could shoot,
you know,
um,
one 80.
Yep.
You know what I mean?

1634
01:34:59.651 --> 01:35:03.620
And nobody was down.
Now if the hooch was covered and had full of around it,

1635
01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.510
then as we came in,
one of the guys in the left or go down,
lay down,

1636
01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.373
looked behind,

1637
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:12.410
the other guy would be right here at the corner so he could see anybody coming

1638
01:35:12.411 --> 01:35:13.244
out a window.

1639
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:16.670
And then we'd have the other guy over here and then we'd go in and hit it.

1640
01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.370
But what I'm saying is when we did that,
it was like that.

1641
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:24.200
I mean that and that was our immediate action stuff that we did.

1642
01:35:24.201 --> 01:35:27.110
That's how we'd hit a hooch.
And then when guys went in,

1643
01:35:27.111 --> 01:35:31.370
they had switch one swing high swing low just to,
you know,
to check it out.

1644
01:35:31.371 --> 01:35:35.780
Then they'd go through and then it's a clear or we got someone and then whoever

1645
01:35:35.781 --> 01:35:39.910
was right next to the door facing out,
cause we had our security,

1646
01:35:39.930 --> 01:35:43.500
didn't know if anyone but he was going to come behind you is that bring the guy

1647
01:35:43.501 --> 01:35:43.851
out.

1648
01:35:43.851 --> 01:35:48.680
Like I had my 60 I'd stick my 60 right between his legs and fold down than it

1649
01:35:48.681 --> 01:35:52.760
put my 60 in his mouth and go shit.
He wouldn't say much.
You know,

1650
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.130
and we'd take off.

1651
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:59.140
<v 0>Yeah.
That,
that you were talking about how the Sas,
one time you went home,</v>

1652
01:35:59.141 --> 01:36:01.010
show the SAS and they went out there,

1653
01:36:01.050 --> 01:36:05.340
you're out there for like 10 days and no one said a single word the whole time.

1654
01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:09.480
<v 3>If you did say something you put here right next to the guy or your mouth right.</v>

1655
01:36:09.481 --> 01:36:12.750
He actually was there and talk.
But normally it was all answering those.

1656
01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.380
<v 0>But like what you're talking about,</v>

1657
01:36:14.381 --> 01:36:16.930
all the stuff that you just described to do all that stuff without talking to

1658
01:36:16.931 --> 01:36:20.230
everyone just knows where to go.
It's,
it's a standard operating procedure.

1659
01:36:20.231 --> 01:36:23.140
It's the immediate action,
Joel and everybody knows exactly what to do and yeah,

1660
01:36:23.141 --> 01:36:23.760
that's

1661
01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.960
<v 3>yes.
Like you get a booby trap or something,</v>

1662
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:28.920
the smartest thing to do is back away and come in in a different way.

1663
01:36:28.921 --> 01:36:30.210
But if you had to keep going,

1664
01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:35.280
you'd feel it with your hand and grabbed the guy next to you behind you and show

1665
01:36:35.281 --> 01:36:38.490
him where it was.
Then you'd step over,
move on a few steps,

1666
01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:42.390
wait til he got over it by grabbing the guy behind him and you just keep moving.

1667
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:46.930
How often would you guys do that?
Not Too often.
We,

1668
01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:49.860
we did run into him occasionally,
but we were kind of lucky.

1669
01:36:49.861 --> 01:36:52.150
We never hit plus you'd see,
uh,
uh,

1670
01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.100
[inaudible] you'd be able to pick up the signs if you did happen to go on a

1671
01:36:56.101 --> 01:36:56.880
trail,

1672
01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.880
you could see broken branches facing a certain way or a little little sticks

1673
01:37:03.331 --> 01:37:07.080
pointing in a certain way or,
or actually we got landed one time in this,

1674
01:37:07.081 --> 01:37:10.530
a rice patty and we look after we got off,

1675
01:37:10.531 --> 01:37:13.560
everybody started looking around and all you could see was two doors signs,

1676
01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:16.680
which a man minefield.
So we didn't move,
you know,

1677
01:37:16.681 --> 01:37:19.620
we just call it the choppers back in and took off.

1678
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:24.700
<v 0>So your,
your second deployment to Vietnam,
how many casual,</v>

1679
01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:26.830
how many cats does he,
no one got killed,
right?
No,

1680
01:37:26.831 --> 01:37:28.510
we didn't get anybody hit or killed.

1681
01:37:28.570 --> 01:37:32.400
No one got hit or killed despite getting in all of those gunfights.
Yeah.

1682
01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:38.190
<v 3>Don't ask me which one of those things.
God's a frog man.
We figured,</v>

1683
01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.110
you know,
we're getting to the point,

1684
01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.820
that's why we had six month deployments and not a year or you know,
whatever.

1685
01:37:44.850 --> 01:37:48.630
Cause uh,
you start feeling like you're invulnerable,
you know,

1686
01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:54.120
but we're on the cutting edge and uh,
we just had the firepower.
We were better.

1687
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:56.400
I mean,
you could have the odd Jenna,
like that one,

1688
01:37:57.370 --> 01:37:59.520
the one that went right by me or something.

1689
01:37:59.521 --> 01:38:02.580
I could have hit me right in the chest or you had too much skill to get hit.

1690
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:08.280
It wasn't skilled at pure luck.
Dude.
I know.
It's like a,

1691
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:12.150
unfortunately in combat you can do everything right and you can still get killed

1692
01:38:12.151 --> 01:38:14.490
and he can do all kinds of things wrong and live.

1693
01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:18.210
We did that stay behind ambush that one night.
I think I told you about that.

1694
01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:22.080
I don't think so.
Okay,
so butter second op,

1695
01:38:22.081 --> 01:38:27.081
we had Vietnam thought we're going to go in and hit this one area here and if no

1696
01:38:28.201 --> 01:38:31.080
reason the uh,
the little village or anything like that,

1697
01:38:31.081 --> 01:38:32.880
then we're going to do a stay behind ambush.

1698
01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:37.980
And so a squad of us went in and patrolled through through some,
uh,

1699
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.530
Willie Peter to hooches shit like that,

1700
01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:43.560
and just kind of caused hate and discontent.

1701
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:48.180
And then the sun started going down.
So as soon as it's hard going down,

1702
01:38:48.181 --> 01:38:52.320
we've gotten an l shaped ambush being were rice patties.
We're going this way,

1703
01:38:52.330 --> 01:38:53.190
that way and stuff.

1704
01:38:53.191 --> 01:38:57.270
And then we had the other choppers came in like they were going to pick us up.

1705
01:38:57.570 --> 01:38:58.890
We had our other squad on it.

1706
01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:01.980
They got off the chopper ran around and got back in it like we're being

1707
01:39:01.981 --> 01:39:06.720
extracted.
Right.
So we sat there and sat there for about 45 minutes,

1708
01:39:06.721 --> 01:39:08.430
almost an hour,
Nelson here,

1709
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:13.040
these guys come walking down this rice dock with AK 47 shit and stuff.
And uh,

1710
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.860
we opened up on them and you know,
blew him off the rice dyke and shit.

1711
01:39:16.861 --> 01:39:19.890
And then they opened up on us from the treeline,

1712
01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:23.880
hit him a little bit to see what else came in and did some damage and shit.

1713
01:39:23.881 --> 01:39:27.030
And then the fucking chopper comes in.
There was only one of them,

1714
01:39:27.031 --> 01:39:30.540
so we'll all couldn't get on it.
We landed with two choppers,
you know,

1715
01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:33.570
so me and another guy,
a radio man,

1716
01:39:33.571 --> 01:39:38.200
and I'm a stoner guy myself stayed there.
Why that chopper went long.

1717
01:39:38.210 --> 01:39:41.510
Cam wasn't too far away.
Come back and picked us up,
you know,

1718
01:39:41.511 --> 01:39:44.400
and my poop was a little tighter,
tight on that and stuff.

1719
01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:47.570
How long were you sitting on the ground?
Oh,

1720
01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:50.380
about another 20 minutes before they can,
we got us.

1721
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.160
But nobody came in to the village after that because we had,

1722
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:56.880
we had hammered them that so,
and that was pretty good.

1723
01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.200
But that was a brilliant up.
Anyway.

1724
01:39:58.201 --> 01:40:01.890
So I'm shooting my 60 he's over here shooting the 40 Mike,
Mike,

1725
01:40:01.891 --> 01:40:06.120
and there's a small stream between us and we got back were drinking beers,

1726
01:40:06.121 --> 01:40:09.930
patent poopers dean,
you know,
tell him tall tales and she hasn't,
he says,

1727
01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:13.890
God damn,
didn't you see that fucking string around?

1728
01:40:13.891 --> 01:40:18.310
So went right by on the stream and I says,
no,
cause that's,
shoot my 60 you know,

1729
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:24.310
it was pretty neat.
You know what I mean?
That's some good times over there.
Yeah,

1730
01:40:24.311 --> 01:40:27.600
that's,
that's an amazing deployment to do all that Jay behind ambush,

1731
01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:31.830
classic pure.
I mean just the way you want to do it.
They knew we were there,

1732
01:40:31.831 --> 01:40:36.420
they thought we'd laugh,
they came in and we got the son of a bitches,
you know,

1733
01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:40.470
and then they always say,
you know,
did your shooting Guy Yourself?

1734
01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:43.740
Well you know when you open up with stoners in sixties and you see guys flying

1735
01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:44.970
off a rice tax and shit,

1736
01:40:45.150 --> 01:40:49.350
you're not sure if it's her 60 that hit em or if it's a stoner or whatever,

1737
01:40:49.351 --> 01:40:51.960
you know?
Yeah.
So it's the only one time.

1738
01:40:51.961 --> 01:40:56.961
I know I hit a guy for a fact is that often that when we came off the choppers

1739
01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:02.020
and did that OK corral thing.
Well then me and a guy,
another guy went around the,

1740
01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:06.520
before the squad continued moving by,
we wanted to check out the back,
you know,

1741
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:09.460
so you know,
it goes walking around and he had a car,

1742
01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:14.230
he was our Korman and I saw him walk around the edge and fire about three times

1743
01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:14.891
I stepped by,

1744
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:19.060
he missed the guy and here's this guy with an AK 47 right about here.

1745
01:41:19.061 --> 01:41:21.700
And I stepped around with my 60 pointing right at him,
you know,

1746
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:26.230
and I just flipped him.
And then we joined up and went,
kept going.

1747
01:41:26.590 --> 01:41:30.940
And then three guys popped up out of the rice dyke and one they started shooting

1748
01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:32.380
at us and we were shooting back.

1749
01:41:32.381 --> 01:41:36.490
But a sea wolf was coming right over us and three rounds went right through the

1750
01:41:36.491 --> 01:41:39.340
instrument panel on the Seawolf didn't hit anybody.

1751
01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:44.470
They turn like this and the guy had a mini gun and he just went on and we just

1752
01:41:44.471 --> 01:41:47.080
dropped down because there was fucking rounds going everywhere.

1753
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:52.720
<v 0>Yeah,
that's the amount of firefights you guys are getting into.
Take no cash.</v>

1754
01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:56.020
We didn't.
That's amazing.
That's amazing.

1755
01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.130
<v 3>And we didn't have a lot of pictures either because we didn't have a</v>

1756
01:42:00.131 --> 01:42:02.780
professional photographer walking around with it.
Yeah.

1757
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:08.240
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean it's a,
we missed,
I would say in Ramadi,</v>

1758
01:42:08.241 --> 01:42:12.800
we missed the real,
like a couple deployments later,

1759
01:42:12.801 --> 01:42:15.230
maybe a year later when guys we're going on appointments,

1760
01:42:15.231 --> 01:42:18.110
they had pictures of everything because they had helmet cams and they had all

1761
01:42:18.111 --> 01:42:20.420
this stuff and we didn't.
And as a matter of fact,

1762
01:42:20.421 --> 01:42:22.880
at that time there was like rules against taking pictures.

1763
01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.350
So we don't have a bunch of pictures.

1764
01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:30.250
<v 3>Both platoons I was in,
we took one just before we deployed and you know,</v>

1765
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.640
the whole platoon and then,
uh,
uh,
hardly nothing else after that.

1766
01:42:34.650 --> 01:42:38.990
We wouldn't let photographers close to us.
We wouldn't let a,
uh,

1767
01:42:39.330 --> 01:42:41.060
newspeople even come close.

1768
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:43.370
We weren't a Vietnamese based thing where they couldn't get on it.

1769
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:45.710
It was perfect and we just,
yeah,

1770
01:42:45.711 --> 01:42:48.590
we just went out and did her thing and had to get diamond.

1771
01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:52.040
Didn't beat no drums about it,
you know what I mean?
It was,
it was good.

1772
01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:53.610
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:42:53.610 --> 01:42:57.010
<v 3>There was a couple of platoons that had a photographer with him that took a lot</v>

1774
01:42:57.011 --> 01:43:01.620
of pictures of shit and you probably,
you probably seen them and you know,

1775
01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:03.313
we didn't.

1776
01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.620
<v 0>Yeah.
And there's platoons for in Iraq there was platoons,
it gotten Trump.</v>

1777
01:43:06.621 --> 01:43:08.860
And that's one of the reasons why we didn't take pictures cause there was the

1778
01:43:08.861 --> 01:43:13.861
tunes that had pictures that got exposed and got released and they will,

1779
01:43:13.911 --> 01:43:14.291
shouldn't have,

1780
01:43:14.291 --> 01:43:18.010
they were pictures they shouldn't have taken and they got trouble and it not

1781
01:43:18.011 --> 01:43:21.580
just that they got in trouble,
but it was bad press,
bad press for America,

1782
01:43:21.581 --> 01:43:24.520
you know.
And uh,
that's why there was rules.
It was like,
Hey,
no pictures.

1783
01:43:24.521 --> 01:43:25.860
So we don't have a lot of pictures of him.

1784
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.890
<v 3>Right.
How to do a hundred things right.</v>

1785
01:43:27.891 --> 01:43:30.110
And you do one thing wrong and that's what's going to pop up.

1786
01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:34.870
<v 0>Yeah.
And you do one thing wrong and you take a picture of it.
Yep.
And these days,</v>

1787
01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:39.880
you know,
that picture is going around the world in 30 seconds.
So it's a,

1788
01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:42.480
the desk.
One thing that has definitely changed and,

1789
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:45.400
and like I said when we were in Ramadi,
we were just like,

1790
01:43:45.401 --> 01:43:50.260
I don't think people were really on social media yet that we know not everybody

1791
01:43:50.261 --> 01:43:52.460
had a camera and not everybody,

1792
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.820
you know had a video can these guys got video cameras now that got helmet cams.

1793
01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:59.210
I got all this stuff and you know,
some of it's good,
some of it's beneficial.

1794
01:43:59.211 --> 01:44:01.400
I mean you're not going to get any better intel.
Then there was a,

1795
01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:04.550
a company commander from the first of the five or six who was one of the best

1796
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:08.510
guys I've ever worked with,
but he videotaped every time he went out on patrol,

1797
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:11.990
you know,
Humvee or,
or not in a Humvee.
However,
he was going on patrol.

1798
01:44:11.991 --> 01:44:15.560
He filmed the whole thing and he was working in one specific district of Ramadi

1799
01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:16.940
called the [inaudible] district.

1800
01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:20.750
And he would come back and watch those videos and he would just,

1801
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:23.270
he and I sat there and watched him with them one time and he goes,
yeah,

1802
01:44:23.271 --> 01:44:25.370
you see this garbage can over here.
Yeah.
This,

1803
01:44:25.371 --> 01:44:27.680
this one's a good landmark cause it's a different color.

1804
01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:30.970
And then up on this street corn right here,
this is,
uh,
this,
this,
uh,

1805
01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.400
poll is always filled with so many wires.
It always scares me,
you know,

1806
01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.690
cause there's so many wires hanging off it.

1807
01:44:35.691 --> 01:44:39.700
And he just had the whole city memorize because he had a camera rolling and his

1808
01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:42.890
home Humvee the whole time and for,
so for that reason,

1809
01:44:42.891 --> 01:44:45.910
plus when you gather intel,
you know,
you're going into a building and,

1810
01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.660
and you've got pictures of everything you got.

1811
01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:50.090
If anyone ever goes in that building gun here to here to here you go,

1812
01:44:50.091 --> 01:44:52.580
well here's what it is laid out.
So there's some definite benefits to it.

1813
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:56.390
But yeah,
there's some real drawbacks as well.
If you know,

1814
01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.150
for people can use that stuff for propaganda against you.

1815
01:44:59.151 --> 01:45:02.810
Or if you're videotaping things or you're recording things that are going to

1816
01:45:02.811 --> 01:45:07.760
make,
you know,
the Americans look bad.
And now you're saying,
okay,
you did this.

1817
01:45:07.761 --> 01:45:10.700
Well,
here's what was happening in the situation.

1818
01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:14.390
Here's why this happened and here's the context.
Well,

1819
01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:16.340
the context isn't gonna make it on to youtube.

1820
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:18.650
The only thing that's gonna make it on to youtube is the thing that makes

1821
01:45:18.651 --> 01:45:20.560
America look bad.
And that's what's going gonna so

1822
01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:21.181
<v 3>that has got it.</v>

1823
01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:24.350
And that's what the reporters are going to key on regardless of what you see.

1824
01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:28.330
We had barn dance files.
I tell you about that.
I think he did mention him.
Yeah.

1825
01:45:28.410 --> 01:45:32.760
Barden Dan files where this,
every time you went on an up and you came back,

1826
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:38.180
the guy who was telling you was there intel guy or first class and uh,
we'd,

1827
01:45:38.181 --> 01:45:41.610
he'd fill out these barn dance cards,
like to call them barn dance.

1828
01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.690
Cause that's just the pro word for whatever or yeah,

1829
01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:47.040
but if they had the who where,
what,
and whys equipment,

1830
01:45:47.041 --> 01:45:48.300
anything we found out there,

1831
01:45:48.301 --> 01:45:53.040
what firefights we've got into what a [inaudible] with the enemy we're using.

1832
01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:57.720
Anything that would be good intel.
And it was just a five by four by five card.

1833
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:58.710
But it was really good.

1834
01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:03.520
And every platoon like are the platoon we relieved already had theirs.

1835
01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.190
So if we're going back into a specific area that that went into,

1836
01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:11.310
we had it organized,
you know,
we'd look it up,
pull it up,

1837
01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.460
read and see what they hit and what they got and all that stuff.

1838
01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:19.080
And that would be help us out when we were going on and we did our briefs and

1839
01:46:19.081 --> 01:46:20.910
stuff and we'd do the same thing,

1840
01:46:20.911 --> 01:46:25.770
but every platoon who would have these barn dance files of what they did and the

1841
01:46:25.771 --> 01:46:28.470
areas they went into and stuff and it was pretty good,
you know,

1842
01:46:28.650 --> 01:46:30.380
that's how we did it.
You know,
that uh,

1843
01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:33.570
we didn't do the Camry quarter like you're saying,
but we,

1844
01:46:33.571 --> 01:46:37.920
anything that we saw that wouldn't be of interest of another patrol or another

1845
01:46:37.921 --> 01:46:40.930
platoon going into that area,
then we'd let them know,
you know,

1846
01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.480
through the barn dance files.
Yeah.
And then like you said,
uh,
when we got to

1847
01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.180
a Dong Tam,
Vinh Long Providence,

1848
01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:55.140
what did a split us up into provinces or districts in that province.

1849
01:46:56.550 --> 01:47:01.550
And then we would go out whether a kit Carson scouts or interpreter and gather

1850
01:47:01.831 --> 01:47:04.650
intel from the PSB guys.

1851
01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:07.650
The chiefs are from the SF that were out in the field,

1852
01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:12.390
indoor rangers that were doing fire bases and stuff like that and bring that

1853
01:47:12.391 --> 01:47:17.040
back.
And then we would put it up on our sip map and start working,
you know,
like,

1854
01:47:17.041 --> 01:47:20.860
uh,
we had this one,
um,
we knew through our,

1855
01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:25.260
our province at this one VCI which you've your high level guy,

1856
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:30.420
they wouldn't transmit communicationwise they would bring your orders in and

1857
01:47:30.421 --> 01:47:31.800
packets,
you know what I'm saying?

1858
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:36.000
And he would come through the province maybe once a month,

1859
01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:40.650
once every two,
all the different information to the VC,

1860
01:47:40.651 --> 01:47:43.290
what they want him to hit and stuff.
But he had all this stuff.

1861
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:45.390
We knew he came through there every time,

1862
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.500
but there were three different trails that he used because we'd gotten intel,

1863
01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:53.400
we didn't know which one it was,
you know,
so we went out on the one trail,

1864
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:56.340
did an ambush wax and people and shit like that.

1865
01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:59.290
So we knew when the next time he came he wasn't going to do that trail.

1866
01:47:59.790 --> 01:48:02.400
And then we did the same thing on the other trail.
Right.

1867
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:06.870
So we figured he's going to come down this trail.
And so we set up on him.

1868
01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:10.380
Got Him.
He came down that trail and we got him,
got some good Intel.

1869
01:48:10.410 --> 01:48:14.370
That's beautiful.
But that was just working with actual Intel,

1870
01:48:14.610 --> 01:48:18.000
trying to figure it out and,
and work in it,
you know.
So yeah,

1871
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:19.650
work out real good.

1872
01:48:20.110 --> 01:48:22.330
<v 0>Were you on that?
I've always heard about the software.</v>

1873
01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.800
They wanted to get this one VCI and they ended up hitting like his,

1874
01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:32.600
his family or some member of his family.
And then when they went to the,

1875
01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:35.340
when they had the funeral they went and got the guy that

1876
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:36.600
<v 3>no,
I wouldn't have on that.</v>

1877
01:48:36.601 --> 01:48:39.960
And there's a lot of things that happened and like you say,

1878
01:48:39.961 --> 01:48:43.190
when you're in your platoon,
that's Kinda your world and that stuff.

1879
01:48:43.191 --> 01:48:45.830
And I've heard of,
I don't remember hearing about that,

1880
01:48:45.831 --> 01:48:49.400
but I probably was one time and the trade winds,
the bar,

1881
01:48:49.401 --> 01:48:53.180
we used to drink the corn auto or something.
I'm sure that that was brought up.

1882
01:48:53.210 --> 01:48:57.950
Like I used to hit tax collectors and get their uh,
Piasta from him,

1883
01:48:57.951 --> 01:49:00.020
their money and then they would turn,

1884
01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.610
turn that into MPC and stuff,
you know,
just different things

1885
01:49:06.110 --> 01:49:08.540
collector because that's a,
that's a good thing.
You know,

1886
01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:13.640
I support PNF he had a whole bag full of money.
You will.
Oh well,

1887
01:49:13.670 --> 01:49:14.090
you know.

1888
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:17.900
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
No that's,
that's,
that's awesome.
That's a,</v>

1889
01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:22.520
and it's all another thing that people,
you know,
it's all self generated.

1890
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:24.740
So much of it is self generated.
Like when you're talking about,

1891
01:49:24.741 --> 01:49:25.670
it's the same thing for us.

1892
01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:29.690
I mean I had an intel group but my intel group was seals,

1893
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:34.750
some Intel seals and some Intel guys and they created all of our Intel and you

1894
01:49:34.851 --> 01:49:38.270
know,
our guys fed into it and so we produced our own targets.

1895
01:49:38.290 --> 01:49:41.600
Kind of like what you're saying.
Yeah.
People have this thought that,
you know,

1896
01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:46.160
the assault force is sitting there waiting for some command to come down and go

1897
01:49:46.161 --> 01:49:48.130
hit this target.
But the reality is we're making

1898
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.740
<v 3>up the targets,
we're figuring them out ourselves most of the time.
Yeah.</v>

1899
01:49:50.741 --> 01:49:54.490
Why can see the difference from my first book tune or we didn't have anything.

1900
01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.080
And my second platoon where we actually worked off of actually actionable intel

1901
01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:01.210
that we got,
it was like night and day.

1902
01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:05.320
I would do a whole different world and just like we talked about before we

1903
01:50:05.321 --> 01:50:07.270
started this,
you know,
you've got,
you're fine,

1904
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:12.310
you've got your fix and then you got your finish and exploitation,

1905
01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:13.443
you know what I mean?

1906
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:17.590
But that we're the best in the world I think on da stuff to finish.

1907
01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:19.540
But you can't do the,

1908
01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.080
the finish if you don't have the fine where you know what to go and hit,

1909
01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:23.943
you know what I mean?

1910
01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:27.730
And that's why long time ago we started up that field graph and all that other

1911
01:50:27.731 --> 01:50:31.480
stuff.
But
we are approved advisers.

1912
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:35.040
We had a training site up in Quia Maca,

1913
01:50:35.670 --> 01:50:39.430
you know we called to advanced training and it was for approved visors because

1914
01:50:39.431 --> 01:50:43.600
they would go over there by themselves or with one of their American and have

1915
01:50:43.601 --> 01:50:48.340
about 50 VC,
whatever that they were in charge of.

1916
01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:52.030
And that proves actually were for when the CIA would,

1917
01:50:52.031 --> 01:50:53.350
could collect intel,

1918
01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:58.030
but they didn't have a method of going out and hidden that,
you know,

1919
01:50:58.031 --> 01:50:59.770
react on doing the finished part of it.

1920
01:50:59.771 --> 01:51:02.170
So that's when they started the [inaudible] program.

1921
01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:07.510
And then we had a provincial prevention recon units is what they were called.

1922
01:51:07.511 --> 01:51:11.180
Proofs we call improves.
Like you say,
if I throw out an acronym,
no,

1923
01:51:11.230 --> 01:51:14.500
I'm just making sure because I'm just so used,
you know,
anyway.

1924
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:18.850
And they would pull a select guys to go through this prude training and east

1925
01:51:18.851 --> 01:51:23.320
coast guys too.
And um,
then they would go over and work for the,

1926
01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:26.020
said they'd be in charge.
You said VC,

1927
01:51:26.050 --> 01:51:29.080
but you didn't mean that rex VC vizio not,

1928
01:51:29.090 --> 01:51:32.710
not the act of guys that you avoid and stuff and decided they wanted to make

1929
01:51:32.711 --> 01:51:36.640
money,
you know what I mean?
So mercenaries is what they were.
And um,

1930
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:42.160
so,
uh,
they had that train up.
Coy mean tree.
Does it mean turncoat?
What does it,

1931
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:45.610
uh,
two boys.
A guy that,
yeah,
you left the uh,

1932
01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:50.640
the lead side or the Mba and went to Hawaii actually means no,

1933
01:51:50.741 --> 01:51:54.340
I don't the actual amount of it,
no,
I think it's a good,
it was a,

1934
01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:57.790
they'd put him in this camp and like when we went to Dong Tam,

1935
01:51:58.270 --> 01:52:00.340
we went to that camp with our interpreter,

1936
01:52:00.341 --> 01:52:04.780
but we just hadn't have a special boat guy at the time.
MST,

1937
01:52:04.781 --> 01:52:06.280
we call it a mobile support team,

1938
01:52:06.281 --> 01:52:09.850
not SBU that spoke fluent Vietnamese.

1939
01:52:09.851 --> 01:52:13.720
So we'd bring him with us when our interpreter didn't realize this guy could

1940
01:52:13.721 --> 01:52:15.310
speak Vietnamese to,

1941
01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:20.080
and then we'd start interrogating guys for our district that we're in,

1942
01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:20.710
you know,

1943
01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:25.710
for myself or Vinh long where the guys were and we had talked to them,

1944
01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:29.140
interrogate them and stuff and they sounded like they were good to go.

1945
01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:32.860
Then we'd bring him in as Care Carson Scouts and they would stay with us and

1946
01:52:32.861 --> 01:52:35.040
we'd let them go and stop at anytime we had an off.

1947
01:52:35.041 --> 01:52:38.440
They stayed with us until the op was done and stuff.
You know what I mean?

1948
01:52:38.441 --> 01:52:41.890
Then we just didn't let him go.
But they turned out that they were great guys.

1949
01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:43.420
And um,
anyway,

1950
01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:48.440
the proof program was about six months long and a half.

1951
01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:52.880
It was craft halfway was medical cause you had to have that when you're working

1952
01:52:52.881 --> 01:52:56.400
out there,
the medical especially cause you're on your own out there,
you know,

1953
01:52:56.420 --> 01:53:00.180
and you've got to be able to take care of yourself if she hit and um,

1954
01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:03.590
and then they would uh,
come over.
But these guys would also,

1955
01:53:03.591 --> 01:53:05.600
after they got done like we're going in,

1956
01:53:05.601 --> 01:53:10.601
another platoon would be able to get that is everything he did.

1957
01:53:10.941 --> 01:53:14.060
But we had about seven guys that are six guys.

1958
01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:19.610
It was one of them that went to a special school like Camp Perry,

1959
01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:22.490
but it wasn't camp here is different.
Was there a shorter version?

1960
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:26.780
And they got that training and they're the ones that were the cadre for that
sat.

1961
01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:29.990
And like my first platoon in 69,

1962
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:34.310
my whole platoon went through most of that before we deployed over.

1963
01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:37.760
So you get all that stuff.
We didn't get to field craft portion of it,

1964
01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:42.750
but they had some great,
really good,
uh,
uh,

1965
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:46.520
quick killed trails and stuff like that and map and compass and everything.

1966
01:53:46.521 --> 01:53:49.910
You know what I mean?
And we're lucky cause the platoon every once in a while,

1967
01:53:49.911 --> 01:53:52.640
if they didn't have guys going through would be able to pick that up and go

1968
01:53:52.641 --> 01:53:57.440
through it.
But that was a superb training.
I mean really good.
You know,
that's,

1969
01:53:57.710 --> 01:54:00.830
yeah,
it all boils back to training all.
Yeah.

1970
01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:03.270
That's one of the best things about the seal teams and stuff.

1971
01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:07.730
They call them to advanced training or sat training specifically for the

1972
01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:11.650
prevention of recon units that they sent the guys over to.
Uh,

1973
01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:16.700
so when you got back from that deployment of Vietnam now,
like I said,

1974
01:54:16.701 --> 01:54:19.850
that was the November thing was the last full deployment to Vietnam.

1975
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:24.950
And you now,
you know the wars kind of over,
but,

1976
01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:29.380
but you stayed in the teams.
Did you go right to buds?
I mean,
yeah,
that,

1977
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:33.300
so I get these orders to the activity of space and I thought what the Shit,

1978
01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.710
cause that's when the dirty 30 was happy and all that.
So yeah,

1979
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:39.890
I blame the [inaudible] the dirty 32 people now,

1980
01:54:39.891 --> 01:54:44.570
dirty 30 is where after the war we had too many people and they wanted to cut us

1981
01:54:44.571 --> 01:54:47.480
down.
So even though guy who just got out of trees and stuff,

1982
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:51.470
they pick 30 guys to go out to the fleet fee,
divers,

1983
01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.240
ELD and stuff like that.

1984
01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.900
And after two years they could come back or whatever and it was just sucked.

1985
01:54:56.901 --> 01:55:00.890
It was just one of the low points I think of the teams.

1986
01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:05.660
Imagine you just made major,
made it through buds and or Udt training,

1987
01:55:05.661 --> 01:55:06.770
whatever they called her back then.

1988
01:55:06.771 --> 01:55:09.560
It might've been buds and next thing you know you're,
you know,

1989
01:55:09.561 --> 01:55:12.120
you're going to dive score somewhere anywhere.

1990
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:16.880
I went over to and that was really pissed.
I went over to,
uh,
to um,

1991
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:20.570
uh,
buds as an instructor,
land warfare.

1992
01:55:20.571 --> 01:55:22.850
It was a third phase and all that shit.
But,
uh,

1993
01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:28.670
they still had LDN program going on then,
which is,
uh,

1994
01:55:28.671 --> 01:55:33.160
we're uh,
you know,
gotten his action.

1995
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:38.240
Some other guys did and I wanted to stay there and still do the LD and then I

1996
01:55:38.290 --> 01:55:41.850
figure,
I don't know,
I just was one was selected to go to buds.
Yeah.

1997
01:55:42.170 --> 01:55:44.490
Then when I got done with,
I went back to t one.

1998
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:48.900
How long were you at Bud's instructor?
For two years.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1999
01:55:49.050 --> 01:55:50.730
And then you go back to t one.

2000
01:55:50.731 --> 01:55:54.950
I was there again for about seven years and it took about three or four
platoons.

2001
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:58.580
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
When you see Budz now,

2002
01:55:58.581 --> 01:56:00.380
cause you still are in the community,

2003
01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:04.820
is there any major difference that you notice between what you went through and

2004
01:56:04.821 --> 01:56:09.190
what you see now?
A lot more land warfare now.
Yeah.

2005
01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:13.190
I think the kids get trained better.
There's so much more to learn under old.

2006
01:56:13.191 --> 01:56:13.941
Half our class,

2007
01:56:13.941 --> 01:56:17.600
Pauline would have flunked just academic way with what the guys got to know now.

2008
01:56:17.601 --> 01:56:21.950
I swear to God we were a frog band.
There was,
you know,
one of them that hard.

2009
01:56:21.951 --> 01:56:25.180
But now with all the calm and everything those guys go through,

2010
01:56:25.230 --> 01:56:29.830
they teach that stuff and buds,
they teach common buds.
They teach some of it.

2011
01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:31.950
Yeah.
Not all of it,
but some of it.
And they,

2012
01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:36.700
a lot of ideas when I go out to a San Committee and stuff,
I guess they do,

2013
01:56:36.701 --> 01:56:39.620
maybe they don't.
Maybe that's more than SQT,
but yeah,

2014
01:56:39.621 --> 01:56:42.910
they gotta use radios and shit there in buds.
But it's just a,

2015
01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:48.240
it's a mixture between what we did next QT and what was the frog man.

2016
01:56:49.211 --> 01:56:50.950
But I think the frog man part of it,

2017
01:56:50.951 --> 01:56:53.740
the EDD part of it is kinda really slacked off.

2018
01:56:53.741 --> 01:56:57.280
I think they do a few cursory parallel,

2019
01:56:57.310 --> 01:57:01.360
perpendicular recons and stuff like that.
But,
uh,
when I went through,

2020
01:57:01.361 --> 01:57:06.130
we were in that fucking how much it was so cold and everybody always says this,

2021
01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:11.740
you earned your wetsuit.
Uh,
and it wasn't a full wetsuit.
It was just the,
uh,

2022
01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:14.230
well that's for sure.
Yeah,
it was the same with me.
We had,

2023
01:57:14.231 --> 01:57:17.560
we had the old wetsuits with beaver tails and we,

2024
01:57:17.561 --> 01:57:20.550
even when I went through this is 1991.
Right?
Yeah.

2025
01:57:20.551 --> 01:57:23.950
And so it's not like you couldn't get a Doosan good surfing wetsuit because I

2026
01:57:23.951 --> 01:57:27.130
surfed and I knew what a good wetsuit was.
So they gave me that Shitty,

2027
01:57:27.190 --> 01:57:32.170
a wet suit with the beaver tail with a big Zipper,
big,
loose open.

2028
01:57:32.171 --> 01:57:35.440
It looked like a 1970s disco.
There's so much water going through that thing.

2029
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:38.380
It was almost not worth wearing.
Well we,
we,

2030
01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:43.500
our first one was in Udt and no fans are nothing.

2031
01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:47.820
You are and your friends go,
yeah.
Once you get appreciation,
they had a,

2032
01:57:48.190 --> 01:57:51.400
they called a wet suit appreciation and then they fade appreciation.

2033
01:57:51.401 --> 01:57:53.290
So to get your friends to,
you know,

2034
01:57:53.291 --> 01:57:57.340
and then we got our fans that we still did a couple of swims without the wetsuit

2035
01:57:57.341 --> 01:58:00.770
that we got our wetsuit.
And I mean,
it was like Jesus Christ,
you know,

2036
01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:04.750
everybody always says,
yeah,
you,
you don't mind cold water d.
And I says,

2037
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:06.730
I've hated cold water all my life.

2038
01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:09.760
It's just part of her job and it's what you do.
You know what I'm saying?

2039
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:14.980
You only get wet once.
You know what you just,
Oh,
you're going to get wet.

2040
01:58:15.010 --> 01:58:18.880
You can just get it wet one time and that doesn't matter anymore.
But the uh,

2041
01:58:18.910 --> 01:58:21.290
I mean,
and there's certain things that I don't think if change,

2042
01:58:21.291 --> 01:58:24.470
like there's always been a 5.5 nautical mile swim.
Yeah,
right.

2043
01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.050
That I don't think that's gotten any shorter.

2044
01:58:26.051 --> 01:58:27.520
I don't think that that just is what it is.

2045
01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:32.630
A lot of the standards have stayed the same physically and it

2046
01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:35.410
fluctuates a little bit.

2047
01:58:35.411 --> 01:58:40.411
I think about who's the director over bud and how many times they roll people

2048
01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:44.620
and everything back in the day.
I mean,
if our guy was,

2049
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:47.670
it got dropped or something,
he was gone.
Never saw him again.
He was just,

2050
01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:51.010
he was just out of there,
you know,
it wasn't come back later.

2051
01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:53.360
Maybe they did after a couple of years or something.

2052
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:57.370
Like we had a guy in our class name,
uh,
getting hit.

2053
01:58:57.371 --> 01:58:59.380
It had been in class 37,
I think,

2054
01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:03.640
and he had broke his hip and then he was in my class and he made it,

2055
01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:04.533
you know what I mean?

2056
01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:07.960
<v 0>Really got hypothermia bad.</v>

2057
01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:14.900
There was a guy and there was a guy in my class that had rolled back is Jeff

2058
01:59:14.901 --> 01:59:18.020
eggs as a matter of fact,
who's a Jujitsu guy.
But he had hypothermia.

2059
01:59:18.021 --> 01:59:21.020
They dropped him for hypothermia and he would and he wouldn't.

2060
01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:26.330
So they told him,
he's out there like,
you're done.
Hey Man,
listen,

2061
01:59:26.331 --> 01:59:27.740
you're a great guy but you can't,

2062
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:31.490
you can't be in the program anymore because you just get hypothermia too easy.

2063
01:59:31.491 --> 01:59:35.540
And he's like,
no,
I'm not leaving.
And they gave him his dungarees back,

2064
01:59:35.541 --> 01:59:37.960
which is like the regular navy thing that you wear.

2065
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:41.340
And he showed up with the class on Monday with his dungarees zone,

2066
01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:43.760
just PT and with the class in the compound.

2067
01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:45.680
And they looked at him and they're like,
all right,

2068
01:59:45.681 --> 01:59:49.670
we'll give this bastard or another shot.
Yeah,
he was,
he's a hard dude.

2069
01:59:49.671 --> 01:59:51.480
And he made it through hypothermia.

2070
01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:57.350
<v 3>He did.
He,
um,
exhaustion.
When you get it to the heat thing,</v>

2071
01:59:57.710 --> 02:00:01.110
that'll come back and bite.
You know,
it really does.
I mean,
I swear to

2072
02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:02.960
<v 0>got it.
Hypothermia is like that too.
Yeah.</v>

2073
02:00:03.070 --> 02:00:06.400
If you get it real bad case because I knew it was like that with heat
exhaustion,

2074
02:00:06.401 --> 02:00:08.320
but I didn't know it was like that with hypothermia.
I think it is.

2075
02:00:08.321 --> 02:00:12.550
I mean maybe I'm wrong,
I'm just know that's what I heard.
So I don't know.

2076
02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:16.270
Well I'm lucky because I've always been pretty well marbled in terms of

2077
02:00:16.271 --> 02:00:20.480
installation is those really skinny lean dudes.

2078
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:21.560
We found out

2079
02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:25.650
<v 3>if you swim as hard as you can,
you usually stay warm anyway.
That's a good boy.</v>

2080
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:27.830
I don't like treading water and cold water.

2081
02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:30.980
You know like that swimmer line I was telling you about that was,

2082
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:33.830
that was painful.
God Almighty,
that was cold.

2083
02:00:34.670 --> 02:00:36.950
And I told you when we first got the budge,

2084
02:00:36.951 --> 02:00:41.020
they had us go down to four oh one and gave us the talk,
you know,

2085
02:00:41.021 --> 02:00:44.330
and the guy left he and right here it won't be there seizure to pass a

2086
02:00:44.331 --> 02:00:47.700
marshmallow through the keyhole of a needle than make it through and we're all

2087
02:00:47.701 --> 02:00:51.440
going,
yeah,
whatever.
And so they marched just all back in front of the bay.

2088
02:00:51.441 --> 02:00:53.070
You know,
I told you you were on the bay side.

2089
02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:56.760
And then the guy was telling you about come walking out and he kind of look at

2090
02:00:56.761 --> 02:01:00.540
us and we're kind of like,
yeah,
yeah,
how Tufts can this be and everything.

2091
02:01:00.541 --> 02:01:05.030
And he said,
uh,
about face forward,
March in March,

2092
02:01:05.031 --> 02:01:07.180
this all of their dress blues right in the water.

2093
02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:10.950
So you got your flap sticking out like this.
All the white hats floating in.

2094
02:01:10.951 --> 02:01:13.190
The officer's hadn't kind of looked at each other.

2095
02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:17.800
<v 0>Damn.
This may not be that easy.
And it went downhill from there,
you know,</v>

2096
02:01:19.190 --> 02:01:22.510
get
dressed blues.
Dude,

2097
02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:27.790
that's difficult.
Uh,
so you got done,

2098
02:01:27.791 --> 02:01:29.230
you got done with being a buds and structure.

2099
02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:32.590
You went back and you did a bunch of,
how many platoons did you do back?

2100
02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:37.420
I did overall nine.
That's not that many.
But I mean it was good actually.

2101
02:01:37.421 --> 02:01:40.070
That is a lot for anyone that's listening and doing nine per period is a lot.

2102
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.020
<v 3>Cause that's nine platoons with workups.
Yeah.</v>

2103
02:01:42.021 --> 02:01:46.270
That's like 20 years worth of work right there.
Uh,
um,

2104
02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:48.830
and then,
you know,

2105
02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:53.840
had her story about you and you got into a fight with some guy at an island.

2106
02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:59.150
Oh yeah.
It was like,
ah,

2107
02:01:59.151 --> 02:02:03.110
you got into a fight with some guy at nylon was that was this guy that was just

2108
02:02:03.111 --> 02:02:07.910
out of prison?
That's the one,
yeah.
Darion yeah.

2109
02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:12.710
Somehow.
You know,
I heard the story from my platoon chief and he and he said,

2110
02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:16.750
Oh yeah,
you said Roger Aids a toughest bastard alive.
And I had to go eagles.

2111
02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:21.130
Yeah.
One time we're out at Niland and there's some guy in a bar and he's,

2112
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:25.310
whenever something happens and you guys throw down and apparently you guys had

2113
02:02:25.311 --> 02:02:29.090
like a legit like five maybe 10 minute fight.

2114
02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:30.470
Oh it was terrible.

2115
02:02:32.210 --> 02:02:35.140
I walked in the bar and I'm just sitting there and he is strong,

2116
02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:40.300
kept playing his watch and he rides a saddle and finally I asked the bark Tinder

2117
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:44.100
gotten damn,
can you play a different song guide?

2118
02:02:44.130 --> 02:02:46.430
Turns it off in this great big guy stands up.

2119
02:02:46.431 --> 02:02:50.540
Like he said he had blonde hair about six,
four.
I think.

2120
02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:56.000
Look,
just look those steel blue eyes and stuff and how come you turn that off?

2121
02:02:56.001 --> 02:02:57.790
And a bartender pointed right to me.
Well,

2122
02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:01.870
he said to turn it off and then the guy looks at me and I went,
hmm,

2123
02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:06.110
I don't want to fight.
You know,
just,
you just don't get in fights.

2124
02:03:06.111 --> 02:03:09.260
It was so I started walking out the door going across the other bar,

2125
02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:12.050
which is right across the street,
like you wouldn't have followed me.

2126
02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:17.500
So he follows me out the door and I turned and looked at him and I said,

2127
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:20.370
no,
he's going to follow me over there.
We'll probably warranted fighting.

2128
02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:25.550
So I jumped on one foot twice and hit him as hard as I could write in the,

2129
02:03:25.551 --> 02:03:28.500
John knocked him down,
his head went like this and,

2130
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.930
and hit the wall and some which did right back up.
And I went,

2131
02:03:32.931 --> 02:03:34.400
Holy Shit.
You know.

2132
02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:39.410
So we did about a 10 minute fight and he actually never hit me one time because

2133
02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:41.390
I was just,
I was in really good shape,
you know,

2134
02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:46.040
Ireland running and you know what I mean?
And so finally we squares off again.

2135
02:03:46.041 --> 02:03:49.250
You know,
and I look at him and he looks at me and I'm covered in blood,

2136
02:03:49.251 --> 02:03:51.830
but it's his blood dripping on me cause I just kept,
you know,

2137
02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:56.870
have to guide ever hit me.
He had killed me.
He was fighting for fun,

2138
02:03:56.871 --> 02:03:59.600
I was fighting for my life.
You know that,
that's the deal.

2139
02:03:59.930 --> 02:04:03.350
So we scores off again and finally I went a week,

2140
02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:07.130
I'm not tired yet and we can keep on fighting or we can go across the street and

2141
02:04:07.131 --> 02:04:10.190
have a beer.
And he thought about it.
He says,
well,
let's go have a beer.

2142
02:04:10.610 --> 02:04:11.810
Puts his arm around me.
You know,

2143
02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:16.470
you're pretty tough for a little guy and I'm almost crying.
God,

2144
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:20.480
thank God that was probably the toughest fight I've ever been in.

2145
02:04:20.481 --> 02:04:22.280
And that guy was a Jesus.

2146
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:25.760
And then I found out he'd been in prison and that's what he did.

2147
02:04:25.761 --> 02:04:28.120
His weight lifter and box when he was in prison.
Yeah,

2148
02:04:28.130 --> 02:04:30.340
that was how I got out of that.
I'll never know,
man.

2149
02:04:30.341 --> 02:04:32.750
That was the punchline was the dude just got out of prison.

2150
02:04:32.751 --> 02:04:34.020
It was a weightlifter in a box,

2151
02:04:34.290 --> 02:04:38.810
got box or wasn't worn out gas.

2152
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.120
A few moments of excitement in that one.
And then you,
uh,

2153
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.390
you became a warrant officer.
Yeah,
I was a master chief.

2154
02:04:45.391 --> 02:04:50.100
I was master chief of group one and at that was all I was going to do after that

2155
02:04:50.110 --> 02:04:51.660
wasn't going to go war calm or anything.

2156
02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:53.820
And that's when they came out with a warrant program.

2157
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:58.830
So I put him for warrant and went warrants and then deployed to Desert Storm,

2158
02:04:58.831 --> 02:05:01.850
came back.
And then,
uh,
we started the,
uh,

2159
02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:06.180
that special program I was in.
And he did that for about a year,
year and a half.

2160
02:05:06.181 --> 02:05:11.160
And the benevolence of a war come decided we didn't need that anymore.

2161
02:05:11.161 --> 02:05:15.870
So they took us all in,
put us into run the first,
uh,

2162
02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:20.190
as QT for group one instead of having an,
at the teams.

2163
02:05:20.191 --> 02:05:24.630
And then we did that.
And then I went from that to,
uh,
start doing all auris.

2164
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:26.730
That's awesome.
I'll send each step doing or

2165
02:05:27.130 --> 02:05:28.930
<v 0>when I was in my second platoon,</v>

2166
02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:33.280
all the guys that all of our new guys went through your,
uh,
your ESCO QT.
Yeah.

2167
02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:36.700
Yeah.
We've,
we've been going for like two hours right now.
Just,
um,

2168
02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:39.640
I want to get one more question.
Some,

2169
02:05:39.641 --> 02:05:44.641
some people listen to the podcast that want to go in the seal teams and you

2170
02:05:46.331 --> 02:05:47.110
know,

2171
02:05:47.110 --> 02:05:51.850
any sort of thought on what they should be thinking about when they're trying to

2172
02:05:51.851 --> 02:05:54.400
get in or trying to go through.
They ask me all the time,
you know,

2173
02:05:54.401 --> 02:05:57.970
I always say real simple stuff,
you know,
like,
Hey,
do a bunch of pull ups,
pushups,

2174
02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.970
dips,
swim,
run and don't quit.
And,

2175
02:06:01.971 --> 02:06:03.460
and that's how you make it into the seal teams.

2176
02:06:03.461 --> 02:06:07.060
And when you get in the seal teams,
you know,
work your ass off.

2177
02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:10.010
<v 3>Well,
you know,
you give it all those kids up at the pretreating,</v>

2178
02:06:10.011 --> 02:06:14.120
upper great lakes,
you know,
physically fit perfect.

2179
02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:17.360
And,
uh,
if the mental thing,
it's a,

2180
02:06:17.361 --> 02:06:20.360
you got to take each day at a time when you get there.

2181
02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:22.130
And if you finish that day,

2182
02:06:22.131 --> 02:06:24.830
be real happy then get the next day and keep going on.

2183
02:06:24.831 --> 02:06:27.600
Don't look ahead of what you gotta do.
But,
uh,

2184
02:06:27.601 --> 02:06:32.150
it's like when I was a second time,
I was at bud structure as a master at arms,

2185
02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:34.850
you know,
and I'd get all these guys in and I'd tell him,

2186
02:06:34.851 --> 02:06:39.320
if you want to do everything we want to do and have the easy life go ELD,

2187
02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:43.730
if you think you're going to be a diver and a working diver,
I said,

2188
02:06:43.731 --> 02:06:47.390
go be a diver.
And I told him,
if you want to be cold,
wet and miserable,

2189
02:06:48.110 --> 02:06:51.740
then go on the seals.
But I will say one thing,

2190
02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:55.010
even going through buds and you can probably attest to this,

2191
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:59.450
that just gets you into the teams and then you deploy.

2192
02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:04.480
And that's where you pull from what you experienced in bud rather,

2193
02:07:05.331 --> 02:07:09.670
where you have to push yourself to the Nth,
you know,
like,
um,

2194
02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:13.580
there again,
two and 69,
we were doing this,
uh,

2195
02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.230
when I was with kilos platoon,
we're going to set up the Sam Bush on this river.

2196
02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:22.880
We had to go through about a click and a half of mangroves shit.

2197
02:07:22.881 --> 02:07:26.540
And that's where it was all gray and shit from Agent Orange and shit.

2198
02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:31.670
I was up to my knees in mud up to my waist in water.

2199
02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:33.793
And uh,

2200
02:07:34.130 --> 02:07:38.230
when you're holding your up high enough to keep it out of the water and you go

2201
02:07:38.231 --> 02:07:41.710
for about a click and a half in that shit using just compass,

2202
02:07:41.711 --> 02:07:43.440
because there were,

2203
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:47.620
we didn't have gps and all that shit and you kept going to your rent to the

2204
02:07:47.770 --> 02:07:52.030
stream or whatever you're going to set it up on.
He had a strain headache so bad,

2205
02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:56.970
you're fucking ice or cross and you're breathing in mosquitoes in your mouth and

2206
02:07:56.971 --> 02:07:59.230
spitting them out and shit like that.
That's a,

2207
02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:06.190
you do that and you come back and three beers and pat poopers,
you know,

2208
02:08:06.191 --> 02:08:07.120
you're good to go.

2209
02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:12.280
Or you're in Korea and in Pohang and you got to hit this target,

2210
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:16.270
but you got to go over about three mountain ridges because you can't run the

2211
02:08:16.271 --> 02:08:17.170
ridges and Korea.

2212
02:08:17.171 --> 02:08:21.820
You got to go up and down them and come out of a submarine and land on the beach

2213
02:08:21.821 --> 02:08:23.750
and it's cold and you're,

2214
02:08:23.850 --> 02:08:27.250
you're kind of covering why one guys trying to take off his wet suit and he's

2215
02:08:27.251 --> 02:08:31.340
fallen down until he gets it off that then you do it and you get about halfway

2216
02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:34.330
up the first a mountain ridge before you start getting warm.

2217
02:08:34.630 --> 02:08:38.930
That's when you find out a few,
uh,
if you got or not,
the bottom line is,
uh,

2218
02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:43.990
we complete the mission,
you know?
Yup.
That's what we do no matter what.

2219
02:08:43.991 --> 02:08:46.540
But like I say,
buds,
hell week,
all that shit.

2220
02:08:47.050 --> 02:08:50.920
Just get you your mind in the right place to know that,
well,
God damn,

2221
02:08:50.921 --> 02:08:53.260
I went through hell week.
I can do this.
You know what I mean?

2222
02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:57.400
And other things like the five mile swim and all that stuff.
And that's all.

2223
02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.210
It's just a,
it's,
it's more I've seen when I was an instructor,

2224
02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:05.500
great big guys that were football players fall out and quit.

2225
02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:08.900
And I've seen little skinny guys that you'd laugh at and thinking of this guy's

2226
02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:12.740
going to be a seal and he makes it through.
It's all because of appearance.
Mine,

2227
02:09:12.850 --> 02:09:14.770
you know.
Do you agree?
I mean,

2228
02:09:15.050 --> 02:09:17.420
<v 0>yeah.
And I've always,
you know,</v>

2229
02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:24.080
bugs and screening process and you don't actually learn much in buds.

2230
02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:27.050
It just gets rid of the people that don't want to be there.

2231
02:09:27.051 --> 02:09:29.780
And the real test comes when you,
you know,
when you get into combat,

2232
02:09:29.781 --> 02:09:32.000
because going into,
you know,
being cold,

2233
02:09:32.001 --> 02:09:35.570
wet and miserable for two or three or four or five days and training and doing a

2234
02:09:35.571 --> 02:09:39.810
bunch of push ups doesn't compare it to what you were just talking about or
yeah.

2235
02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:44.020
<v 3>Think of the sand and all that shit that you went through that,
yeah.
I mean,
I,</v>

2236
02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:48.160
I don't like the desert and I don't like coding the mountains.

2237
02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.950
You can give me the jungle anytime and I'm a happy camper.

2238
02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:55.290
<v 0>Yeah,
I don't like mosquitoes so I'll take the desert or the mountains.</v>

2239
02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:58.190
But those are the things,
you know,
you know,

2240
02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:02.340
I always say that or I always talk about seeing my guys lined up to go out and

2241
02:10:02.341 --> 02:10:04.530
Ramadi and their,
their home.

2242
02:10:04.531 --> 02:10:06.900
These are lined up and like if I wasn't going on the op,

2243
02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:09.360
there's just like platoon was going out and I'd stand there.

2244
02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:12.140
I salute them like as they were leaving.
No,

2245
02:10:12.150 --> 02:10:16.440
I'd just stand out there and slew them as they were rolling out and what it

2246
02:10:16.441 --> 02:10:19.820
takes to be the lead Turret gunner in the first home.

2247
02:10:19.821 --> 02:10:23.730
V is more than what it takes to get through buds.

2248
02:10:23.790 --> 02:10:28.680
Like that guy who knows that there's been,
you know,
an id on the road,

2249
02:10:28.681 --> 02:10:29.790
he's about to drive by.

2250
02:10:29.970 --> 02:10:34.970
There's been seven to 10 ideas a on that road and he's the lead Turret gunner

2251
02:10:36.590 --> 02:10:38.900
and he's going to roll out again.
And he did it the night before.

2252
02:10:38.901 --> 02:10:41.000
He did it the week before and you did it the night before that.

2253
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:43.730
That's what the test is.

2254
02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:46.950
<v 3>Plus or reminded me when I was on that,
um,</v>

2255
02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:51.820
Boston whaler to where is he?
He's up at the top right.

2256
02:10:53.110 --> 02:10:55.570
What can people see him?
Yup.
Yup.

2257
02:10:56.330 --> 02:11:00.150
Any a rockets or anything like that,
you know where it's going to go.
Yup.
Yeah.

2258
02:11:00.610 --> 02:11:04.150
Cause we're gonna want to stop that from shooting,
you know what I mean?
But,
uh,

2259
02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:08.060
just so,
just an example,
I mean like when I was in Subic would be,
uh,

2260
02:11:08.590 --> 02:11:13.590
we'd take the two weeks was pretty neat because the topography there was you'd

2261
02:11:14.111 --> 02:11:19.111
go from triple canopy jungle down to mangrove to where the lower mal was,

2262
02:11:19.811 --> 02:11:22.900
which was their,
their,
uh,
fuel places and stuff.

2263
02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:24.880
While I'd take my guys up to the,

2264
02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:29.230
about four or five of them up to the hospital,
which was up top,

2265
02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:32.560
we'd go down through the triple canopy jungle,

2266
02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:34.260
worked her way all the way through,

2267
02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:39.010
spend the night and come in and hit the lower mouth.
So they had triple canopy,

2268
02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:42.580
regular jungle and mangrove swamps type of stuff.

2269
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:45.310
And they were going to just to kind of let them know,
you know,

2270
02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:46.900
this is what it was like boys.

2271
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.820
<v 0>Yeah.
That's all.
That's that.
And that's what it's like.</v>

2272
02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:54.290
It's like that's why we train hard and to be prepared for that stuff.
So,

2273
02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:58.730
yeah.
Awesome.
Awesome advice.
Echo.
Speaking of advice,

2274
02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:01.220
do you have any advice on how anyone,

2275
02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:05.030
if they want to maybe support the podcast or support themselves,

2276
02:12:05.090 --> 02:12:07.880
how they could do that?
Quick,
quick question,

2277
02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:13.430
quick question.
You mentioned the booby traps a lot.
Like what kind of booby trap?

2278
02:12:13.490 --> 02:12:14.720
What is it like trip wires?

2279
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:18.710
<v 3>God,
we were ever before when we deployed in,
I don't know if it was,</v>

2280
02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:20.450
I think it was 70 71.

2281
02:12:20.451 --> 02:12:25.451
We stopped in Hawaii and went to the EOD booby trap course that they had,

2282
02:12:26.211 --> 02:12:29.600
that they'd picked up over the years in Vietnam and set it all up.

2283
02:12:29.601 --> 02:12:33.290
And after we went through that thing you did,

2284
02:12:33.291 --> 02:12:36.950
he want to go over just about,
because it was unbelievable that they would,
uh,

2285
02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:41.780
do stuff like,
um,
they'd like to use you guys or call my ids,

2286
02:12:41.781 --> 02:12:44.000
but there'd be like mortars up in trees.
And stuff.

2287
02:12:44.001 --> 02:12:48.270
And they'd use different methods like a guy named [inaudible].
Yeah,

2288
02:12:48.690 --> 02:12:49.111
they got,

2289
02:12:49.111 --> 02:12:54.111
he got here with a command detonated a might've been a mortar and you hit him

2290
02:12:54.901 --> 02:12:56.340
pretty bad.
But uh,

2291
02:12:56.341 --> 02:13:00.440
but sometimes they would take filament down and put a uh,

2292
02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:04.500
official,
it's on it so that you'd grab it.
You wouldn't feel it on the bottom,

2293
02:13:04.530 --> 02:13:08.520
you know,
and uh,
Paul said off whatever they had set up,

2294
02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:13.350
if you usually saw a filament line that was just kind of sagging and everything,

2295
02:13:13.351 --> 02:13:16.740
you'd go ahead and cut that.
If it was tight,
she didn't fuck with it.

2296
02:13:16.741 --> 02:13:17.221
Like you say,

2297
02:13:17.221 --> 02:13:21.330
the smart thing to do is the back way and coming in another direction and the

2298
02:13:21.331 --> 02:13:23.760
way the are point scouts did it,
they were really good.

2299
02:13:23.761 --> 02:13:27.460
They would take a thin uh,
uh,

2300
02:13:27.690 --> 02:13:31.950
branch or stick,
you know,
real thin.
Like just like when you're right,

2301
02:13:31.951 --> 02:13:33.690
you can feel all of bite on the line.

2302
02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:36.420
They would take that and they would hold a kind of in the center.

2303
02:13:36.421 --> 02:13:40.350
And as we're moving slow,
they move.
At any time that thing dipped,

2304
02:13:40.590 --> 02:13:41.940
they had reached out and feel it.

2305
02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:45.540
Like a lot of other times if you going down a trail,

2306
02:13:45.570 --> 02:13:49.890
which isn't a really good idea anyway,
but you step over a log,

2307
02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:53.580
sometimes they'd put a pressure detonate and stuff over that log if you stepped

2308
02:13:53.581 --> 02:13:57.720
on it.
So you'd always want to go to the side.
Just a myriad of things.

2309
02:13:57.721 --> 02:13:58.554
There was a,

2310
02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:00.353
<v 2>Ooh,</v>

2311
02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:06.110
<v 3>a lot of the stuff was command detonated.
Like when we were on those river boats,</v>

2312
02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:08.570
there was this place called Snoopy's knows,
you know,

2313
02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:10.550
and we'd have the boats going like this,

2314
02:14:10.551 --> 02:14:12.440
and when they would turn one group of boats,

2315
02:14:12.441 --> 02:14:14.120
another group of volts would be here,

2316
02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:17.960
and then they would open up on this group of boats.
So they would shoot across,

2317
02:14:17.961 --> 02:14:20.990
but it wasn't that far to the war.
The other boats were,

2318
02:14:20.991 --> 02:14:24.350
and they'd started getting hit and thinking,
God damn were being shot at.

2319
02:14:24.351 --> 02:14:27.450
Then you go back and forth,
or they would,
uh,

2320
02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:31.910
put a beef 40 rocket.
Then they'd be down here in a spider hole,

2321
02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:33.200
but they'd have a,

2322
02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:34.933
<v 0>uh,</v>

2323
02:14:35.490 --> 02:14:37.930
<v 3>like singing old pulse,
little and sticking up.</v>

2324
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:41.670
And as soon as the boat got right there,
they would hit the command thing.

2325
02:14:41.810 --> 02:14:43.470
Rocco would go off and hit the boat.

2326
02:14:43.710 --> 02:14:46.740
Everybody had opened up here and these guys would be giggling,
taken off,

2327
02:14:46.741 --> 02:14:49.260
you know what I mean?
Just uh,
just,
yeah.

2328
02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:53.650
<v 0>You know,
the,
uh,
the EOD guys that we had nowadays in the seal teams,</v>

2329
02:14:53.651 --> 02:14:56.830
the guys that come and they go through workup with,
they're awesome.
You can't,

2330
02:14:56.831 --> 02:14:58.930
you couldn't,
if someone normal person was watching,

2331
02:14:58.931 --> 02:15:01.780
they wouldn't be able to tell who's EOD and who's not in at least when we were

2332
02:15:01.781 --> 02:15:04.120
in Ramadi,
and that's where most of the EOD guys are.
Like,

2333
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:09.310
but my IUD guys talking about not wanting to go over there,
my EOD guys,

2334
02:15:09.311 --> 02:15:12.190
they would,
they would put together briefs of like the latest,

2335
02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:14.200
the latest idea that's been out there.

2336
02:15:14.201 --> 02:15:17.200
And this is when we're in Ramadi and you know,
every couple,

2337
02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.190
every maybe like once or once every two weeks they'd put together more of a

2338
02:15:21.191 --> 02:15:25.180
detailed brief of like,
Hey,
this is what it does,
this is this thing.

2339
02:15:25.810 --> 02:15:28.990
And what we would do is when someone new,

2340
02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:32.470
like let's say someone was in from out of town or we had like a visitor that was

2341
02:15:32.471 --> 02:15:35.170
going to go on and off with us,
you know,

2342
02:15:35.171 --> 02:15:38.770
they'd give that extended brief to teach the guys.
Well,

2343
02:15:38.771 --> 02:15:41.400
what it actually did was he would just horrify.
Yeah.

2344
02:15:42.250 --> 02:15:44.000
Showed up there with,

2345
02:15:44.230 --> 02:15:48.850
through that a course that they had there that became like the joke.
Like I,

2346
02:15:48.851 --> 02:15:51.620
you know,
I'd looked at the EOD,
I like,
I see their slide come up and I,

2347
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:53.770
the initial slide and the brief was,

2348
02:15:53.771 --> 02:15:57.400
I could tell it was the big brief and I look over at the person that was going,

2349
02:15:57.401 --> 02:15:58.690
like our guests,
you know,

2350
02:15:58.691 --> 02:16:02.500
maybe it was like a senior officer or someone is going to come or some intel

2351
02:16:02.501 --> 02:16:04.240
person that we're going to go out and run off with us.

2352
02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:07.330
And I'd look them at the beginning of the EOD brief and you know,

2353
02:16:07.331 --> 02:16:08.950
they just have a normal look on their face.

2354
02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:13.030
The by the end of 22 slides later they'd looked like they didn't want to go

2355
02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:16.660
anymore.
Vc would take these uh,
uh,

2356
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.883
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

2357
02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:21.920
<v 3>the stone things you have water in itself,
right.</v>

2358
02:16:22.070 --> 02:16:24.320
And therefore you're going to a village.
We didn't do,

2359
02:16:24.321 --> 02:16:26.100
we didn't usually sweep to villages,

2360
02:16:26.101 --> 02:16:29.770
do shit that fill about half of it up with gasoline.

2361
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:34.150
And if they knew the Americans would come in and take a grenade,
wrap up,

2362
02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:37.610
save rigors tape or something that would disintegrate,
asked one,

2363
02:16:37.810 --> 02:16:39.940
drop it in there.
Then as the guys are going through,

2364
02:16:39.941 --> 02:16:42.580
checking out the hooches and everything,
that would go off.

2365
02:16:42.581 --> 02:16:45.700
I mean like where if we were going to go into a hooch or something,

2366
02:16:46.090 --> 02:16:50.440
we would tie a string to the door and then pull the door open.

2367
02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:54.940
Everybody would be down or if we saw something and then where the steps we're

2368
02:16:54.941 --> 02:16:58.450
going into it.
Sometimes if we weren't hitting it quick,
you know,

2369
02:16:58.570 --> 02:17:01.800
you checked and see what was under the uh,
you know what I mean?

2370
02:17:01.810 --> 02:17:04.780
See if there's anything,
but it's just a,
they were ingenious man.

2371
02:17:04.781 --> 02:17:08.650
They were really beautiful.
They beat the French and shit.

2372
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:13.690
These guys have been fighting for a couple of years,
you know?
Yeah.
Anyway,

2373
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:14.230
go ahead.

2374
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:15.850
<v 5>Sorry.
Yeah,
that was it.</v>

2375
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:20.920
That it's crazy how they get smarter and then you guys get smarter with trying

2376
02:17:20.921 --> 02:17:23.380
to figure it out.
Then they're like,
okay,
they're trying to figure out this.

2377
02:17:23.381 --> 02:17:25.090
So they get sworn in and it becomes,

2378
02:17:25.290 --> 02:17:30.160
that's the game and the game does of the game.
Speaking of,

2379
02:17:30.170 --> 02:17:33.040
speaking of being in the game like that,

2380
02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:35.350
some Alpha brain today,

2381
02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.560
apparently I did Alpha Brain Alpha brain from audit.

2382
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:43.010
I don't think there is any other kind of Alpha brain,
but nonetheless,

2383
02:17:43.011 --> 02:17:47.780
I did take some and we're going to talk about it not for too long.
So anyway,

2384
02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.860
supplements,
supplementation.
So thinking about this I,

2385
02:17:52.861 --> 02:17:55.820
it's taking Krill oil actually is when I was thinking about this,

2386
02:17:57.140 --> 02:18:00.800
where would you be if you didn't take any krill oil or any strong bond?

2387
02:18:01.610 --> 02:18:04.490
Where would you be?
We don't know.
Behind we're not.
I'll tell you,

2388
02:18:04.491 --> 02:18:08.930
you'd be be exactly right.
So,
so it kind of makes me think like,
okay,

2389
02:18:08.931 --> 02:18:12.300
you know anyone who's thinking about,
okay Jocko,
Acca,

2390
02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:14.390
they'd talk about taking Krill oil all the time,

2391
02:18:14.391 --> 02:18:18.020
how much it helps and they didn't start taking it.
You're behind.

2392
02:18:18.170 --> 02:18:22.610
So my recommendation is take the Krill oil,
not to mention the Alpha brain,

2393
02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:26.930
not to mention any other supplements that will help you get to where you want to

2394
02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:27.764
be.

2395
02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:32.370
You talk about procrastination sometimes every once in a while.

2396
02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:35.850
And that's the biggest thing,
by definition,

2397
02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:40.140
that's going to keep you from doing it.
You know,
I get on the supplements,

2398
02:18:40.141 --> 02:18:40.951
that's the point there.

2399
02:18:40.951 --> 02:18:44.970
And if you want 10% off the supplements that we all know are the best

2400
02:18:44.971 --> 02:18:49.680
supplements,
go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko boom.
There it is.

2401
02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:55.050
Support Yourself.
Then you can support others and it's worth the vodcasts.

2402
02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:56.280
Boom.
There it is.
Also,

2403
02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:58.890
another way to support pod podcast is Amazon click through,

2404
02:18:58.891 --> 02:19:02.580
which means before you do your Amazon shopping,
click through the website Jocko,

2405
02:19:02.581 --> 02:19:04.830
podcast.com a little banner.
They're

2406
02:19:06.590 --> 02:19:09.870
a good and natural way to do it is you know when you shop for the books,

2407
02:19:09.871 --> 02:19:11.820
like the books that you cover,

2408
02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:18.420
we have a whole page of all the books,
all of them click through there.

2409
02:19:18.421 --> 02:19:20.240
Boom.
It will take you right to the books you purchased.

2410
02:19:20.241 --> 02:19:24.300
That's a good way to support there is support your brain as well with books and

2411
02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:27.470
educating yourself.
Also,

2412
02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.700
subscribe to the podcast on Itunes,
stitcher,
Google,
play,

2413
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:35.210
all these other podcasting providing platforms.

2414
02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:38.240
If you haven't already,
it's a good way to do it.

2415
02:19:38.241 --> 02:19:40.400
Leave a review if you didn't in the mood.
If you're not in the mood,

2416
02:19:40.401 --> 02:19:43.610
then don't do it or you can still do it if you're not in the little whatever you

2417
02:19:43.611 --> 02:19:47.390
want.
Also,
youtube,
subscribe to that Allen.

2418
02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:49.640
People who have been subscribing,
that's good.

2419
02:19:51.350 --> 02:19:54.350
It's good because it helps spread.
The word seems obvious,

2420
02:19:54.351 --> 02:19:58.280
but when you really think about it is not as obvious as you might think because

2421
02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:01.130
when you get that alert,
it's not just the whole podcast.

2422
02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:05.210
As we always kind of note,
it's like little excerpts,
you know,

2423
02:20:05.211 --> 02:20:09.170
a lot of times or a little bit more artistic excerpts,

2424
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:14.870
you'll be more compelled to share those.
And we talk about shareability,
right?

2425
02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:17.780
When you get,
when someone shares it with you,
that's one thing and you're like,

2426
02:20:17.781 --> 02:20:19.850
okay,
I'll listen to this.
It's only two,
three minutes long.

2427
02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:24.740
But on the reverse side,
when you,
uh,
when you're about to share it,

2428
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:27.740
you'll be thinking kind of in the other person's mind.

2429
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:31.880
They're more into listening to it because it's shorter.
It's subtle,

2430
02:20:31.881 --> 02:20:35.330
but there's a difference.
So anyway,
if you subscribe,
boom,
that you'll have,

2431
02:20:35.370 --> 02:20:39.260
it'll have that effect on you as well.
I know.
Seems magic,
but it's,

2432
02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:43.130
it's very explainable.
Anyway,
point there is subscribe to Youtube.

2433
02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:46.850
That's a good one.
We'll put more videos on there as well.
Also,

2434
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:52.820
Jocko has a store.
It was called Jocko store,
Jocko store.com.

2435
02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:57.710
New Rash Guard is out.
Straight up.
We did it on the Facebook live it,

2436
02:20:57.711 --> 02:21:00.620
put it live on that.
You were there.
I was there.

2437
02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:05.270
I think it was your Facebook live.
I don't think I've ever done a Facebook live,

2438
02:21:05.271 --> 02:21:09.740
by the way.
Anyway,
back to the store.
There's women's stuff on there.

2439
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:13.580
This tee shirts on there.
You have a tee shirt that we gave you a tee shirt,

2440
02:21:13.581 --> 02:21:16.850
right?
Last time.
We'll give you another one.
This step two.
They're pretty dope.

2441
02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:20.450
There's layers.
It's more to the church.

2442
02:21:20.451 --> 02:21:25.370
Then then meets the eye or your kid's shirt is out.
Warrior kid shirts.

2443
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:29.630
Sure.
Adults and children.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2444
02:21:30.050 --> 02:21:34.340
Also Jocko uniform.
That's what I'm calling it.
The Jocko uniform.
Oh,
this shirt.

2445
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:38.570
Victory.
Emma man fitness shirt.
You know the actual original.

2446
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:44.640
Sure.
A hundred percent cotton.
Very soft.
Like a jockey.
The lakes in.

2447
02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:49.400
Anyway,
from I here I,
this is what I heard.
Anyway.
A lot of cool stuff on there.

2448
02:21:49.401 --> 02:21:51.860
If you want to support,
get something,

2449
02:21:51.861 --> 02:21:56.810
there's some patches on there to velcro patches,
regulations,
size for the hats.

2450
02:21:56.811 --> 02:22:01.460
Actually we got hats coming out too,
by the way.
Oh,
a lot of people been asking.

2451
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:03.080
They're not out.
They're not out.
I'm saying,

2452
02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:07.460
I'm saying because when people make these suggestions and a lot of people start

2453
02:22:07.461 --> 02:22:12.120
making it okay,
you know,
the more people that make them,
the more um,

2454
02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:12.950
we,

2455
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:17.840
we are likely to begin to think about executing.

2456
02:22:17.841 --> 02:22:20.370
How you make it sound like such a process,
a long process.

2457
02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:23.330
It's a process because you can't just have like two guys saying,
Hey,

2458
02:22:23.331 --> 02:22:27.120
we should get,
um,
you know,
I dunno.
Something,

2459
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:29.880
earrings or something in another guy's.
Yeah,
that's cool.

2460
02:22:29.881 --> 02:22:32.310
And there's only through exactly right story.
Don't ask.
Boom.

2461
02:22:32.311 --> 02:22:34.410
So you mean my point for me,
so Pat's,

2462
02:22:34.411 --> 02:22:37.720
we're one of those ones where there was a lot of people saying we need or we

2463
02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:41.220
should,
we should have hats.
That would be cool.
And people were like,
yeah,

2464
02:22:41.221 --> 02:22:43.200
I think that too.
So anyway,
that's what on the way

2465
02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:48.990
somebody is out there.
I already mentioned the rash guard,
I think.

2466
02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:52.500
I think we have a lot of good stuff on there,

2467
02:22:52.530 --> 02:22:57.140
but only wait for you to find out is to go to Jocko store.com and find out for

2468
02:22:57.141 --> 02:22:58.140
yourself if you're in the mood,

2469
02:22:58.260 --> 02:23:01.440
get something like that or get something that's on there and it will support the

2470
02:23:01.470 --> 02:23:02.520
podcast.
Also,

2471
02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:07.380
good way to support yourself in your journey journey.

2472
02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:11.910
Are we doing journey or journey?
You've been doing it just so you know.
I know,

2473
02:23:11.911 --> 02:23:15.420
but I just,
I have mixed emotions about it was still not comfortable.
Yeah.

2474
02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:17.490
I like when other people say and not myself anyway.

2475
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:21.120
And you're getting after it journey,
waking up early,
uh,
sticking to the workout,

2476
02:23:21.121 --> 02:23:24.810
sticking to the Diet.
I think that's the,
that's the main one.

2477
02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:28.350
You know what I'm saying,
baby.
But don't say,

2478
02:23:28.351 --> 02:23:31.440
maybe you were at my house the other day and you were,
what?
Were you eating?

2479
02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:36.690
Chicken wings?
No,
there was all bad apple pie.
Was it apple pie?

2480
02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:41.190
No,
there was something nonetheless.
As far as diets go,

2481
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:45.930
I went nuts on the chicken wings.
Technically,

2482
02:23:45.931 --> 02:23:49.470
the way those were made,
that wasn't much of a deviation from the Diet.
Okay.

2483
02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:54.870
Anyway,
the point there being diet is a hard thing.
Yeah,

2484
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:56.820
exactly right,
and that's the point really.

2485
02:23:56.821 --> 02:23:59.940
Even Jocko gets nuts sometimes it was a Saturday so that could have been as

2486
02:23:59.941 --> 02:24:00.780
cheat day.
Who knows?

2487
02:24:00.781 --> 02:24:04.650
But I'm just saying you can be on the program and the Diet thing that'll sneak

2488
02:24:04.651 --> 02:24:08.100
up on you,
that'll sneak up on you and you're not ready.
Like if you,
if you have,

2489
02:24:08.101 --> 02:24:11.920
okay,
I got to wake up at four 30 you know when the insurgent is going to come is

2490
02:24:11.930 --> 02:24:16.930
going to come at four 30 you got to work out at eight 30 or five or whatever

2491
02:24:17.041 --> 02:24:20.880
time.
You know when the weakness might come so you can be ready for it.

2492
02:24:20.881 --> 02:24:23.700
The Diet thing,
you just don't know.
This is what I'm saying.

2493
02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:27.780
So nonetheless he knee moment of weakness.
This is what you do.

2494
02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:34.100
You go to iTunes or Amazon music and get an album with tracks called

2495
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.290
psychological warfare.

2496
02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:42.570
All it is is a bunch of tracks Jocko telling you why you should not skip

2497
02:24:42.571 --> 02:24:46.980
workout.
You should not hit the snooze.
You should not eat the donuts.

2498
02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:51.540
No donut.
Practical logical

2499
02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:56.840
advice from Jocko.
You know why?
Because a lot of people,

2500
02:24:56.870 --> 02:25:01.080
they look for inspirational and ice.
This is practical.
Flimsy,
right?

2501
02:25:01.081 --> 02:25:04.770
Inspirational.
It's very flimsy because it relies on you feeling like it.

2502
02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:06.330
This has nothing to do with feeling.

2503
02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:09.990
This has to do by definition with you not feeling like it.

2504
02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:14.520
So let Jocko talk you into making the right decision.

2505
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:17.370
That's all it is.
A hundred percent effective.

2506
02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:22.580
I dare you to skip the workout after workout and get off whatever the track is

2507
02:25:22.741 --> 02:25:25.000
called cause the ones who have them on there because anyway,

2508
02:25:25.690 --> 02:25:28.990
against psychological warfare,
iTunes still number one by the way,

2509
02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:33.340
that's a check holding,
holding strong,
holding strong for good reason by the way.

2510
02:25:33.390 --> 02:25:36.420
<v 0>Yeah.
Also when you're on Amazon,
you can get Jocko white tea,</v>

2511
02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:40.370
which I'm drinking right now and the reason I'm drinking it is because it's

2512
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:43.980
delicious.
By the way.
What does it tastes like?
Your victory,

2513
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:49.800
a way the war,
your kid book came out,
feedback's been unbelievable.

2514
02:25:49.801 --> 02:25:54.330
Getting photos of kids doing pull ups,
studying,
doing Jujitsu,

2515
02:25:54.331 --> 02:25:57.810
basically getting after it in all realms of getting after it,
which is,

2516
02:25:57.870 --> 02:26:01.830
which has been awesome.
And if you want your kid to get after it,
yeah.

2517
02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:07.170
Or other kids around your kid to get after it and become stronger,

2518
02:26:07.171 --> 02:26:10.080
smarter and better than get them way of the warrior kid.

2519
02:26:10.470 --> 02:26:13.740
And I just got an email yesterday from a friend of the family,

2520
02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:17.850
69 years old.
Is that considered a kid?

2521
02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:20.990
<v 5>No.
Little bit older than the kids.
Only the kid.</v>

2522
02:26:20.991 --> 02:26:23.720
But guess what he said he learned a lot from uncle Jake.
I did.

2523
02:26:23.721 --> 02:26:26.270
I just finished it.
Oh you finished this in a few days ago.

2524
02:26:26.271 --> 02:26:29.180
I read one or two chapters is every night routine,
boom,

2525
02:26:29.181 --> 02:26:31.130
boom with my four year old.
Just feel,

2526
02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:35.020
does she understand that she understands a percentage of it?
She's four.

2527
02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:38.210
Does she understand the impact?
So this is the plan.

2528
02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:40.250
So she's going to understand these really,

2529
02:26:40.251 --> 02:26:43.260
really basic things and maybe you know,

2530
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:44.830
I'm gonna just read it over and over and over it.

2531
02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:48.890
So it comes to ethos kind of thing.
And then after she gets older,

2532
02:26:48.891 --> 02:26:52.730
she didn't start understanding the details and then the more the older she gets,

2533
02:26:52.731 --> 02:26:55.250
the more she understands her book.

2534
02:26:56.710 --> 02:27:00.640
<v 0>Boom.
This guy,
friend of the family,
69 years old,</v>

2535
02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:02.780
learned from it and then he went,

2536
02:27:02.781 --> 02:27:05.560
went and bought a copy for all of his grandchildren and each of them

2537
02:27:05.561 --> 02:27:07.360
individually.
So that's good.

2559
02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:36.860
Echo.
You got anything else?

2560
02:28:37.850 --> 02:28:40.790

2561
02:28:40.930 --> 02:28:43.300
<v 3>for coming by.
Thank you so much.</v>

2562
02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:48.050
Oh my son's been going to,
you did.

2563
02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:52.180
So what are your studio for about six months now and can tell you he loves it.

2564
02:28:52.450 --> 02:28:53.710
Yeah,
he was,

2565
02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:58.880
went to about two and a half years of this fighting boxing guy that was really

2566
02:29:00.341 --> 02:29:04.270
good.
And uh,
but he says that you just saw was a plus the instructors,

2567
02:29:04.271 --> 02:29:08.770
you got our top shelf.
He really likes it.

2568
02:29:08.771 --> 02:29:13.390
And he told me to tell you,
man,
he really enjoys it.
And thank you.

2569
02:29:13.610 --> 02:29:17.960
<v 0>Yeah,
of course.
Uh,
it's,
it's great to have our GM victory MMA.</v>

2570
02:29:17.961 --> 02:29:21.920
It's great to have it.
And to have it,
it's just accessible to people.

2571
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:26.090
There's no walls around it.
It's an open door.
It costs money of course,

2572
02:29:26.091 --> 02:29:29.660
cause you gotta pay rent and all that stuff,
but not that much.
Not,
not crazy.

2573
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:33.830
It's 100 bucks a month.
You can train anytime you want,
anytime you want.

2574
02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:35.600
Well not 24 hours a day,

2575
02:29:35.601 --> 02:29:40.100
but six in the morning until 10 o'clock at night and in other places.
Oh yeah,

2576
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:42.590
like three times as much training,

2577
02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:44.170
<v 3>just Jujitsu.</v>

2578
02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:47.300
You got everything there and he shows that's what he likes about it.

2579
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:49.910
Wide Open and uh,
you know,
he likes it.

2580
02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:54.160
<v 0>Yeah.
It's got Jujitsu,
boxing,
Moy,
Thai wrestling,
MMA,</v>

2581
02:29:55.060 --> 02:29:59.290
crossfit.
It's got everything in there and that's why we built it.
Uh,

2582
02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:03.820
Roger,
you got anything else?
No,
I'm good.
I'm about burnout now.

2583
02:30:05.610 --> 02:30:09.730
Well,
Amen.
Once again.
Thanks for coming on.
My pleasure.

2584
02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:13.900
Just awesome to have you on here.
And the first time that you were on,

2585
02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:16.750
I got a million.
I know you don't do social media,

2586
02:30:17.230 --> 02:30:20.380
but I got a million people saying,
please bring Roger back on.

2587
02:30:20.381 --> 02:30:24.430
Please bring Roger back on.
And now that you were on today and you once again,

2588
02:30:24.431 --> 02:30:27.760
you have a good way of telling little bits of stories that are awesome.

2589
02:30:27.790 --> 02:30:31.840
And I want to hear like a one hour story about sea wolves coming in and dropping

2590
02:30:31.841 --> 02:30:34.770
bombs and spraying stuff down.
And I'm like,
how does that what guy?

2591
02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:36.490
I want to learn the tactics of what was going on.

2592
02:30:36.490 --> 02:30:39.580
So you're probably gonna have to annuity you're burned out for today,

2593
02:30:39.581 --> 02:30:43.960
but you're probably gonna have to get on one one more time at least.
And uh,

2594
02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.950
but thanks for coming on again,
sharing your story,
your experience,

2595
02:30:47.951 --> 02:30:52.360
your wisdom with us,
and more important.
Of course,

2596
02:30:52.930 --> 02:30:56.110
thanks for what you did for our country,
for the navy,

2597
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:57.670
and of course for the teams.

2598
02:30:58.570 --> 02:31:02.740
You're absolutely one of the guys that made the teams what the teams are.

2599
02:31:03.430 --> 02:31:05.200
So thank you for that,

2600
02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:10.230
Roger Honor to have you on here and for the rest of the Vietnam veterans.

2601
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:13.360
And I hear a lot from Vietnam veterans.

2602
02:31:14.350 --> 02:31:19.350
Thanks to all of you for holding the line and thank you for every deployment,

2603
02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:23.670
for every operation,
every mission,

2604
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:28.950
every day spent out on patrol.
Every night spent out in the Bush,

2605
02:31:29.370 --> 02:31:32.760
every helicopter assault,
every river operation,

2606
