This is Jocko podcast number one 64 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.020
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.820
<v 0>I crept ahead a few feet and raise carefully to look over the bank crack.</v>

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.720
A rifle was thrust up and fired only inches from hails head.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.380
The bullets split his scalp and the concussion broke his ear drums.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.660
Blood streamed over his face,
blinding him,
and I helped get him back to Stewart.

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.280
Then I pitched a second bomb close in.
Meanwhile,

9
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:33.870
Macintyre had not halted.

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.560
He had rushed on the and Sam Bro and I have raised as we hurried after him.

11
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.980
A machine gun blazed at us from a spot on the right and we dove into the mud

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.120
crash slam.
The stokes gun was at work,

13
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:51.210
but it's shells dropped short falling almost in our path.

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.720
We rose again as the maxim stopped firing.

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
Then a flaming white hot instant oblivion.

16
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.190
<v 0>When I recovered consciousness,</v>

18
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.780
my head was splitting with pain and a terrible nausea had seized my stomach.

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.450
The Stoke Shell had dropped beside me,

20
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.170
throwing me bodily into the mud and Sam Bro was stunned as well.

21
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.290
He was lying in the slime and feeling his limbs certain that he was wounded all

22
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:22.560
around us was a frightful clamor of guns and bombs and brightful shots.

23
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.850
I heard Macintyre's voice shouting five rounds rapid.
Then it stopped,

24
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.580
but my nose was bleeding and I was too dizzy to stand.

25
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.330
We crawled towards the sound,
then halted.

26
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.700
There was a great plunging in the MERC and to dim figures came toward us puffing

27
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.640
and blowing,
tugging at something.
They were Germans,

28
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.160
big men and a machine gun and tripod.
They placed it just in front of lesson.

29
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.330
One man gang did along cartridge belt.

30
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.710
I pulled the pin from my last bomb and heaved a missalette account of two.

31
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.320
It burst just beneath the tripod.
One man went down like a huge tree.

32
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.500
The other struggled a moment before he stilled.

33
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.710
We went by them making sure the gun was ruined and in new made crater found in

34
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.440
man of a company with his wrist almost severed.

35
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.520
We bandaged him quickly and send them back and we're rising to go on.

36
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:18.600
When Clark came stumbling through the mud and yelled at us,
come on,
give them

37
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.330
his shout was cut off.
He pitched dead in front of us.

38
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.750
The man scurried by with a stretcher and we went over to the bank where we could

39
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:28.650
see men moving.

40
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.390
It was Louis Gunner and he said Macintyre had been shot through the stomach and

41
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:34.224
was dying.

42
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.520
<v 0>They got him on the old stretcher,</v>

44
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.730
but he went on the to the shore bank in front and found old Bill Mickey and

45
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:45.790
Johnson Crouch.
They're shooting at a German gun with that streak.

46
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.010
Sparks not more than 30 yards away.

47
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.060
Sam Bro had bombs with him and he and I hurled them.

48
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.460
The burst seems right.
It seemed right on the gun and it was silenced.

49
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.770
I stared at the other men on the bank.

50
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.040
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.270
<v 0>they were all dead.</v>

52
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.370
Melville and IRA and Jennings lying there together,

53
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.600
rifle in hand,
all shot through the head by one sweep of the German gun.

54
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.390
Old Bill had seen it and stayed thereafter trying to pop the gunner himself

55
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.510
before dead man was poor.
Old Sam at rest.
At last

56
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.360
we looked around and found all the rest of the party.
He'd gone,

57
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.110
but another fit of sickness seized me and I could not move for a long time.

58
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.160
Sam Bro stayed with me.
We did not go back.

59
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.790
We had to crawl a distance to avoid the machine gun fire,

60
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.430
but the main fighting had shifted over to the left.

61
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.670
A light vapor was stealing over the ground,

62
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:50.590
making it harder to see and I stumbled over a body as we found the road bank.

63
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.710
It was the professor riddled with bullets dead.
He was covered with mud,

64
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.340
had lost his steel helmet,
had evidently got lost in the darkness.

65
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:05.341
And there he lay after years of study and culture with Glassy eyes and face up

66
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.700
term to the sky,

67
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.910
a smashed cog of the war machine with not a hope of burial accepting by a chance

68
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:17.161
shell and the mist thickened enrolled suddenly over him.

69
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.190
Knight found us,

70
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:23.940
still crouched in our cover and I got up and went around the shell holes until I

71
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:25.920
found old bill and Johnson.

72
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.940
They told me that a relief was due and that there had been no orders.

73
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.750
<v 0>Then a corporal from another platoon came and called to us to follow him.</v>

75
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.400
We were to go back to [inaudible].
The 16th battalion was relieving us.

76
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.420
We went and met the incoming men by our old trench where we're joined by the

77
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:50.630
remainder of the company and heard that big Glen had been killed.
That is,

78
00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:54.370
he died gloriously in the fighting at the graph house.

79
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.740
All that long dragged back was a hideous nightmare.

80
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.100
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.570
<v 0>The track was worse than when we had come and in the shelling was insistent</v>

82
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.550
incessant.
We moved with infinite slowness.

83
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.560
Every step,
a struggle,
uh,

84
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:17.561
tearing physical effort and a vast noise was all thundering,

85
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.870
rolling clamor that doled our thinking,

86
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.780
mercifully some smothering.

87
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.020
Some of our agonized impressions of that night before

88
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.330
the November rains.
We're chilling,
US freezing us.

89
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.800
Our feet were always soggy and we were almost despondent.

90
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.910
<v 0>All that time we'd been out,
we had talked,</v>

92
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:45.820
but little each man seemed busy with his own thoughts,

93
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.250
disinclined to speak to one another.

94
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.230
There had been to many of our friends killed the men we had been with for
months.

95
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.040
I've found that Mcleod and farmer had in the mud.

96
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.960
Egglestone had been wounded in placed on a stretcher and then he and his bearers

97
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:07.410
were all blown to fragments by a big shell and portaled.

98
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.660
Flynn had been killed.

99
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.520
We seem to move in a days to do things as if we were automatons.

100
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.580
When it grew dark,
we moved again to form a new line.

101
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.420
The Hun spotted us and started shelling wall machine gun fire,

102
00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:28.490
rake the ground up.
Him and I were together.

103
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.850
As we started digging,
I saw body just in front of us.

104
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.990
A big man with his equipment over is great coat catch,

105
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:37.940
hold of that stiff.
I said to Upham,

106
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.520
pull him back here and we'll use them for part of our parapet.

107
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.630
He stared at me,
don't he yelled,
don't touch him.

108
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.540
I seized the corpse myself,

109
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.310
rolling it over into place and up sprang from where he had been spading and

110
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:57.310
commenced on new hole over to the right.

111
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.800
A salvo of shells came and exploded.
Whizzing fragments were all around me,

112
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.190
but I was not touched
up and fell and was dead when I reached him.

113
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.230
There was a strange cry further on.

114
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.520
It was the sergeant major who should have gone to the depot,

115
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.670
the old original he and insisted and coming in for one more trip and his jaw had

116
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:25.460
been carried away by shrapnel.
He died before morning

117
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.970
two other men were down.
Johnson and baron both wounded.

118
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.540
The shelling continued all that night and the next day,

119
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.040
<v 2>yeah,</v>

120
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.440
<v 0>we had dug deep v shaped pits,</v>

121
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.590
connecting some of them and there we crouched gray faces under muddy helmets,

122
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.290
red rimmed eyes,
staring dazed,

123
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.320
wondering our brains numbed beyond thinking by the incessant explosions.

124
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.850
One of the new men pitch down between our shelter and the next one he was

125
00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:05.740
pierced in a dozen places and one arm had been sheered from his body by
shrapnel.

126
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.420
Mickey sat beside me shuttering,
half stoned,

127
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.550
staring unseeing,

128
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.920
his limbs twitching convulsively at each concussion.

129
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:30.170
And that right there is a couple of pages

130
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.660
worth of reading of the book and we go on written by a guy by the name of wheel

131
00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:45.081
bird who was a Canadian soldier that fought in world war one.

132
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.650
And like I said,
that's just a couple of pages from the book.

133
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.680
But the pages go on and on and on just like that war did.

134
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.740
And you,
you explain it like the amount of people killed around him,

135
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.690
a wounded around him.
It's,

136
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.410
it's horrific and it's hard to

137
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
even fathom what that did to these men before,

138
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.553
during,

139
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.560
and after combat physically and mentally and psychologically

140
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.800
and the physical part.
These are things that you can see,

141
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:34.590
you can see those wounds,
you can understand them,

142
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:37.980
but the psychological part is perhaps

143
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:39.190
<v 2>okay,</v>

144
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.020
<v 0>the hardest to understand.</v>

145
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.500
<v 2>Okay.</v>

146
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.500
<v 0>Now I say that this podcast is about human nature and the reason it is,</v>

147
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:52.770
and the reason that I focus on human nature is because in my opinion,

148
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.850
in order to lead people,
you have to understand people.

149
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.100
You have to understand what their nature is.

150
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:01.110
You have to understand human nature and

151
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.510
<v 2>okay.</v>

152
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.890
<v 0>A lot of human nature boils down to psychology.</v>

153
00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:10.220
And I recently got a recommendation from,
uh,

154
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:14.420
trooper out on the interwebs who recommended a book called psychology for the

155
00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:15.290
fighting man.

156
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:21.450
And this is a book that was first printed in 1943 and the book is,

157
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.140
it's an incredible book.

158
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.200
It's filled with an immense amount of very useful information and it's written

159
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:39.620
as almost like a mental guide to the American military men that are getting

160
00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:42.260
ready to go fight the Germans and the Japanese in World War II,

161
00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:44.270
obviously 1943 that's when it's written.

162
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:50.380
This is right in the middle of World War II and even though the book is 75 years

163
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:56.840
old,
the,
the information that's in it,

164
00:10:56.841 --> 00:10:59.270
the knowledge that is contained inside of it,

165
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.310
<v 2>okay</v>

166
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.660
<v 0>can still be utilized today in any leadership situation.</v>

167
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.011
And in fact,

168
00:11:06.011 --> 00:11:11.011
this book is so dense with information that I'm actually going to split it into

169
00:11:11.501 --> 00:11:16.501
two separate podcasts so that we can go into some more detail and not end up

170
00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:20.680
with a 14 hour podcast.
So

171
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.740
let's kick it off.
Going into this book.
As I said,

172
00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:30.640
the title of the book is psychology for the fighting man.

173
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.560
And the subtitle is what you should know about yourself and others

174
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.590
kicks off part one a psychology and combat.

175
00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:46.090
When the British eighth army pursued the retreating axis forces from Egypt

176
00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:48.890
through Libya,
they found a long root grow.

177
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.050
They found along the route great quantities of abandoned equipment,
some tanks,

178
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.180
guns in perfect condition and gasoline for the tanks and ammunition for the
guns.

179
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.260
The physical materiel of a large access force was there,

180
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:04.420
but it was useless to the access.

181
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.750
There were no men left to operate it.

182
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.400
You keep hearing it said that men cannot fight without weapons,

183
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.270
but it is just a true that weapons cannot fight without men.

184
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.400
And Army is men.
Not any men at all.

185
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.490
For a crowd of men may only be a mob,

186
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.010
but trained and equipped men.

187
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.740
What sort of equipment do men have?
An army need?
Planes,
tanks,

188
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:35.170
guns and jeeps.
Mortars,
grenades,
rifles.

189
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:39.730
And bayonets camouflaging mess kits above all food and water.

190
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.040
Everything that the ordinance and quartermaster can supply.

191
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.130
But that is not all.
No.

192
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.540
The men need morale.
They need courage.

193
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.010
They must have confidence in each other.
And the belief in ultimate victory,

194
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.950
who is the quarter master?
Who can issue stocks of courage and confidence?

195
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.950
Yet these are essential weapons.

196
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.340
So we started off with a great point.
Where do you get your courage issued?

197
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.700
Not from the quartermaster,
not from the supply guy.
No.

198
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:20.440
It's got to come from somewhere else and it is just as important part of winning

199
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:23.980
a war as tanks,
planes,

200
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:29.010
bullets and bombs going on and the army must have leaders to plenty of them cos

201
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:34.630
and NCS who supplies them.
Besides leaders,

202
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:39.370
it must have all sorts of special abilities and skills,
mechanical,

203
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.270
mechanical ability and in particular is needed in this new mechanized war.

204
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.980
Ability to drive trucks,
pilot ability,
mathematical ability,

205
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.300
cooking ability,
clerk skills,
lots and lots of abilities.

206
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.520
You can't fight a war without them and the army needs efficiency too.

207
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.150
And efficiency means not only effective organization.

208
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.440
There's also basic efficiency of the individual man,

209
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.340
his strength and health,
his resistance to hardship and fatigue,

210
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.320
his alertness even when fatigued and despite freezing cold or exhausting heat

211
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.430
toughness of body is a weapon,
indispensable to victory.

212
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.340
This book is so straightforward.

213
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.120
It's just so straightforward and it doesn't pull any punches.
It's,

214
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.890
it's one of the best things about this and you can tell it's written,

215
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:33.610
it's directed,
it's directed for like the frontline grunt trooper.

216
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:35.770
That's who it's directed at and not just the infantry guy,

217
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:38.350
but anybody in the army doing any job.

218
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.710
And it's refreshing to read something that's as straightforward as this book is

219
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.850
going on.
The army has a perpetual problem of psychological logistics,

220
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.880
a problem of the supply of motives and of aptitudes and abilities of habits and

221
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:55.274
wisdom.

222
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.600
How does it get this mental materiel to the right places at the right time?

223
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.300
That is what this book is about.
So again,

224
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.690
it's looking at the psychological aspect of warfare and saying,

225
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:13.400
how do you,
how do you deliver these necessary supplies?
We need courage,

226
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.720
right?
We need abilities,
we need emotions,
we need aptitudes,

227
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.390
we need the right habits.
How do you deliver those

228
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.910
back to the book if the army cannot find a man with needed ability,

229
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.200
an effort is made to find one with an aptitude for being trained in that
ability.

230
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.880
And then it trains them all in part by teaching them the rules and the

231
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:37.130
techniques in part by giving them practice.

232
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.180
No troops are ready to go into combat until their training period is over and

233
00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:43.430
even then they are still green troops.

234
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.350
The training is still going on in combat until finally the men are seasoned

235
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:52.700
troops have learned how to meet the unexpected emergencies of war and have

236
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:55.430
acquired that competence and confidence.

237
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.860
That is the basis of their courage.

238
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.213
<v 2>Okay?</v>

239
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:05.230
<v 0>It is this human materiel that determines more than any other one thing,</v>

240
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.510
whether an army will win or lose.

241
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.910
Guns and chow are essential to but given equally of supply victory goes to the

242
00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:16.900
better troops,

243
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:21.820
troops composed of men who know their jobs and do them willingly and well men

244
00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:23.980
with initiative to act by themselves,

245
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.920
the train troops which make up the season to army.

246
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:28.870
<v 2>Okay?</v>

247
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.040
<v 0>There are moreover fundamental differences between people that affect their ways</v>

248
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.350
of fighting and their abilities to fight.

249
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.160
These differences are not,
however,

250
00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:43.600
due to blood as the Nazis teach,
but mostly due to training,

251
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.190
tradition,
home life,

252
00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:49.030
and other things that have a powerful effect on the character of men.

253
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.470
War is waged best by choosing methods of warfare best adapted to the nature of

254
00:16:55.931 --> 00:17:00.160
our own people and opposed to the natures of the enemy.

255
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.153
Peoples.

256
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.530
American men have no particular love for killing.

257
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:06.590
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

258
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.680
<v 0>for the most part,
they hate killing.
They think it is wrong.</v>

259
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.440
Sinful ordinarily punishable by death.

260
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.580
They do not look upon death as a beautiful and glorious experience and most of

261
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:19.850
them do not consider the military life as a suitable life.

262
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.860
Work War Two American men is a dirty,

263
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:29.780
disagreeable business to be gotten over as soon as possible so that we as a

264
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:34.781
nation can get along with what we were happily engrossed in inventing,

265
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.070
producing,
growing,
making life more useful and satisfying.

266
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.170
Americans can stand a long,
hard pull.

267
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.640
They look forward not back.
They are slow to accept.

268
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:55.641
War will not go all out until they are attacked or are sure their ideals are in

269
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:02.850
grave danger.
But once they have started,

270
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.880
they do not stop or spare themselves until the goal of victory seems to them to

271
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:09.294
be secure.

272
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.170
Perhaps in 1919 they made a mistake about having already made the world safe for

273
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:18.870
democracy,
but they would not have stopped had they thought,

274
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.820
had they not thought themselves safe,
nor will they stop.
Now

275
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:30.170
they are not demoralized by temporary adversity or single defeats.

276
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.290
So some good info,
right?

277
00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:38.291
They're clearly trying to set the mental attitude of the American young American

278
00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:45.530
soldiers that are reading this.
We can stand the long hard pull.

279
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.050
If you mess with us,
we're going to finish it.

280
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.510
We're not demoralized by temporary adversity or single defeats doesn't matter

281
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.260
you.
You want a battle right on.
Watch this.
We'll be back.

282
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.450
Continuing on,
it has been said that war is inevitable,

283
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.550
that men are so made that they just have to fight.
That is true.

284
00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:09.230
If you mean they have to be aggressive,

285
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.960
that they need to have power and to use it,

286
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.620
that they are forever wanting to change things that are hard to change,

287
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.380
so as that they can get on with better living.

288
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:24.810
But the fact is that they do not have to fight each other and not many Americans

289
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.420
agree with Hitler in thinking,

290
00:19:28.421 --> 00:19:32.360
fighting other nations a good thing for any nation,
even when the ugly,

291
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.360
ugly business ends in victory,

292
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.410
there are other things than men and nations to fight.

293
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:39.970
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

294
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.910
<v 0>men can fight calamity and disaster,
flood,</v>

295
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.940
fire and famine with anger and zest and even fight nature to prevent disasters

296
00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:50.680
happening.
They fight disease.

297
00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:55.680
Having for a century been waging effective war upon it with a numerable
conquest,

298
00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:59.470
which history now records.
They fight for freedom,

299
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:05.020
freedom to worship as they wish,
freedom to think and speak as they please.

300
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.040
Freedom from want and poverty.
Freedom from fear.

301
00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.760
That's the American and democratic philosophy.

302
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.430
The reason why America is now at war,

303
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.670
every American ought to understand this.

304
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.740
To know why a nation that wants peace has to go to war

305
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.940
because nobody likes murder.
You have to kill the murderers.

306
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.900
You cannot get along without police.
And this war is a policing job.

307
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.130
It's a large scale job because it is a total war.

308
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.930
So clearly this book is,

309
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.300
is answering a lot of questions for an 18 year old kid that's heading out to

310
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:49.900
warn,

311
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.900
maybe doesn't fully understand why or what's happening and here it is,

312
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:58.570
just laying it out.
Look,
these people are bad.
We're good.

313
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.880
They need where the police of the world,
which sometimes in the,
in,

314
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.490
in today's time,
people take that as a negative,

315
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:10.420
like we can't be the world police,
but here he's straight up.

316
00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.740
This is straight up saying,
yes,
we are the world police.
There's bad guys.

317
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.330
We're going to go put them down.
And it's interesting too.
Nobody likes murder.

318
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.430
You have to kill murders.
That's the way it's got to be.

319
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.710
Again,
you know,

320
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:31.711
these days we get so desensitized to buy media right by movies and video games

321
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:38.860
and music talking about killing,
and that's just,
that's the way we grow up.

322
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:44.440
But in the in these days,
you had to kind of convince people that,
hey,

323
00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:47.710
this is the way it's going to go down.
You're going to go kill people.

324
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.090
And that's okay.

325
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.340
Total war is just what its name implies.

326
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.640
War On all fronts with all possible weapons.

327
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.810
There's the home front as well as all the battlefronts there.

328
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.710
Also the military front,
the economic front and the psychological front,

329
00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.940
military economic and psychological warfare,
makeup,
total war.

330
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.410
The Germans had that big idea first,

331
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.540
but the Americans can fight the devil with his own fire and a hotter one and are

332
00:22:19.541 --> 00:22:20.374
doing it.

333
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.620
The three kinds of warfare all related a military success may also be an

334
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.450
economic victory if it results in the capture of great quantities of enemy

335
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.130
materiel or blocks.

336
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:38.131
Important supply routes to the enemy nation or it can be a psychological victory

337
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.120
if it lowers enemy morale,

338
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:45.210
helps to make soldiers expect to feed leads the enemy people to be ready to

339
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:46.414
submit.

340
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:53.750
What I like about this idea of total war is when you apply it to other parts of

341
00:22:55.381 --> 00:22:56.490
your life,
right?

342
00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.260
If you apply it to business and how you can't just focus on one aspect of

343
00:23:01.261 --> 00:23:03.300
business,
you can't just focus on,
hey,

344
00:23:03.301 --> 00:23:05.010
we're going to go out and create something new.
Guess what?

345
00:23:05.011 --> 00:23:06.990
We get to create something new.
We got to sell it.

346
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.140
We've got to figure out the way to get the cost to produce down.

347
00:23:10.141 --> 00:23:11.970
We've got to figure out how we're going to beat our competitors.

348
00:23:11.971 --> 00:23:13.350
We've got to figure out how we're going to spray.

349
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:18.510
You've got to figure out all these things.
Total war in business,
in life,

350
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.200
total war,
right?
How do you win?
The total year?

351
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.240
Life is war,
right?
Your life is a war.

352
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:27.990
You're fighting against all these things that are happening and you're fighting

353
00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:31.500
to win.
You're fighting to be healthy.
You're fighting to be financially stable.

354
00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:34.590
You're fighting to take care of your family in the best possible way.

355
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.100
It's total war and all these things.

356
00:23:38.101 --> 00:23:41.430
You have to fight all of these fronts at the same time all the time.

357
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.980
That's why you can't sleep at night because it's total Warren life.

358
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.430
<v 3>Yeah,
that's so true.
It's like you can,</v>

359
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:53.630
you can be like winning certain battles in life.
You know,

360
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.570
like you can have a great job making great money,

361
00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:01.850
but don't exercise and be poor health,
you know,
or,
or opposite or what.

362
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.780
There's so many like just as battles,
you know?
Yeah,
absolutely.

363
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.960
And you have to be paying attention to those.

364
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.700
You have to pay attention to all the fronts.
Yeah.

365
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.720
And there's a lot of times where people get focused on one front.

366
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.810
Yeah.
And it just doesn't,
it doesn't help.

367
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.060
And even even like inside of a business,

368
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:27.350
you'll get a business where they just focus on one thing and they'll miss it.

369
00:24:27.351 --> 00:24:30.350
They're getting flanked.
Yeah.
Big Time.
Yeah.

370
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:33.670
A lot of those times in this goes in life obviously.
That's what,

371
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.320
how I'm thinking of it.
But uh,
yeah.
And like in companies,
right,

372
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:39.890
where you say they focus so much on one thing and then a lot of times is because

373
00:24:39.891 --> 00:24:43.190
that thing is like has a big payoff,
you know,
like you get,
it seems like,
Dang,

374
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:46.670
I'm getting ahead.
Huge Times.
Especially like at like at home,
right.
Where,

375
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.270
let me just put it in just a few more hours of work.
Right.
A week for a month,

376
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:51.950
two months,
three months,
and Dang,

377
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:55.460
that paycheck comes in and you do sold well for the com.
You go to work,

378
00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:58.490
you're the hero kind of thing and you're like,
Dang,
I'm getting ahead.
Big Time,

379
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.060
but like something else,
we'll kind of falter,
which won't show itself right away,

380
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:04.910
you know?
Then when you like how you seek it,
flank flanked,
you're like,
Dang,

381
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.110
I hope just flank you.
You got to get focused on all fronts.

382
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.020
Continuing on an economic success of our own can lead to a military defeat of

383
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:18.110
the enemy.
If it robs him of essential supplies,

384
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.460
it can become a psychological victory if it disheartens him and makes him

385
00:25:22.461 --> 00:25:25.760
readier to give in.
On the other hand,
of course,

386
00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:30.290
a military victory is useless if it leads to a psychological defeat.

387
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.690
The Japanese may have done a great,

388
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.570
may have done great military damage at Pearl Harbor,

389
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.550
but it resulted in net loss to them because of the effect of uniting the

390
00:25:40.551 --> 00:25:42.020
Americans in anger.

391
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Real defeats other than deaf are psychological in the end.

392
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.350
That's pretty powerful.

393
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.760
Real defeats other than death itself or just psychological,
right,

394
00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.990
so they're just psychological.

395
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.890
The enemy gives up surrenders.

396
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.560
You have to kill the enemy or make him surrender.

397
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:09.860
There isn't any other kind of victory.
If he is fanatical,

398
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.970
you may just have to kill him.
Americans would rather just get them to surrender.

399
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.810
So this is something that's so important to remember is that if you get beat,

400
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.500
it's psychological.
If you're still alive,
it's just a psychological defeat.

401
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.070
You just need to reframe it and how are you going to come back and win next
time?

402
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.390
Psychological warfare is the newest arm in war.
It is directed at opinion,

403
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:38.030
belief,
confidence,
courage,
and the will to fight.

404
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:43.830
It is both defensive and offensive for it tries to build up morale in our people

405
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.190
<v 0>and troops and to break down the morale of the enemy.</v>

406
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.940
The chief weapon of psychological warfare is propaganda.

407
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.700
The radio and the press are used to bolster on the home front.

408
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:57.270
The enemy has reached by newspapers and leaflets dropped from airplanes and by

409
00:26:57.271 --> 00:27:00.630
short wave radio propaganda.

410
00:27:00.631 --> 00:27:04.410
In spite of what many people think is not necessarily dishonest.

411
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.500
Truth is often the best propaganda,

412
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.190
especially when it is fed to persons who are starving for it.

413
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.780
The most effective propaganda must be founded on fact must start from some

414
00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:18.990
important event that actually happened and is known to be true.

415
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.990
Then the propagandist interprets the event.

416
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:27.050
Much as a good lawyer interprets evidence in favor of his client or as the

417
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.510
honest advertiser makes a claim for his product.

418
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:37.020
This is another very important part.
When you're in a leadership position,

419
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:42.110
how much of being leader is making sure that the propaganda it gets out there?

420
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.480
Have you ever heard this expression when someone says,
uh,
you know,

421
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:48.690
you're not really good at telling your story if you ever heard that before,

422
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.290
like a,
like a company there,

423
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.400
they're out there trying to do great things and they are,
they're working harder,

424
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.620
they're having some success,
but nobody knows it.
And I've,

425
00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:00.720
when I work with companies,
there's sometimes the companies,

426
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.590
no one even inside the companies knows about the successes that they're having.

427
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.240
They're failing to even spread the word within their own company.

428
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:14.970
And so they think they're getting crushed by the,
by the competitors.

429
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.080
Because they're not,
because the competitors,
guess what?

430
00:28:17.081 --> 00:28:21.900
The competitor's great at propaganda.
Every time the,
that,
the,
the,
uh,

431
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.790
competitors signs a new client,

432
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.540
they put out a big linkedin post,
right?

433
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.220
They put in a big social media blast,
Hey,
wait,
just the sign.

434
00:28:31.221 --> 00:28:35.830
I know it's great to welcome up our and our newest client.
Meanwhile,
you know,

435
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.380
a company's not doing that.

436
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.530
So everyone inside the company doesn't know that we're signing all these new

437
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:43.400
clients.
So this idea of propaganda is,

438
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.450
is very important in warfare and in leadership and in business.

439
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:54.030
And at the same time you might've heard about this,
I probably have,
you know,

440
00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.830
<v 4>he was Facebook,
maybe Instagram,
I forget,</v>

441
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:58.960
but they did like some study where it like,

442
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:03.160
it actually was linked to people getting depressed because of that.

443
00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:07.720
And it's this,
this con,
that concept that you just said,
well,
you know people,

444
00:29:07.721 --> 00:29:09.190
and this is nothing new.
Where,
where people,

445
00:29:09.191 --> 00:29:13.000
they'll post just their highlights of their life and then like me as just a

446
00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:15.740
normal person and I'm looking at everyone else's highlights of their life.
Think,

447
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.900
Dang,
I don't live that kind of life.
I'm not traveling to Thailand and you know,

448
00:29:19.901 --> 00:29:24.390
all these places,
and maybe I do,
but that was like once last year and this,

449
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.690
you know,
it seems so it kind of that it's,
it's like propaganda maybe on purpose,

450
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.640
maybe not,
but it's like,
yeah,
it's like the perception,
you know,

451
00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.401
where you have,
you,

452
00:29:34.401 --> 00:29:39.400
you know your life and it's like the highlights are like one out of a thousand.

453
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.040
Meanwhile,
everyone seemingly is

454
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.940
<v 0>one out of one.</v>

455
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:48.430
Just all highlights another Sushi restaurant tonight with a bunch of girls and a

456
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.320
Lamborghini,
all that stuff,
man.

457
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.140
And it's like everyone except me,
you know?

458
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:58.660
So it's kind of that feeling Echo Charles,
he's not

459
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.360
whatever,
I'm not gonna fall for it.
I'm not going to fall off.
Yeah,
no,
it's true.

460
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.880
It's true.
And that stuff does,
it does build up.
It does.

461
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.500
And that's like propaganda in your own life.
Now,
believe you,

462
00:30:10.501 --> 00:30:14.680
I'm not recommending that you do good propaganda of your ids to grab to showed

463
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:17.680
your positive life.
No,
no,
I'm not saying that.

464
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:22.530
I'm saying don't believe the hype military psychology is psychological warfare

465
00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:27.210
is not.
However,
the only way which psychology contributes to success in combat,

466
00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:30.420
there are hundreds of others and soldiers and officers need to know what

467
00:30:30.421 --> 00:30:34.680
psychologists know and what psychological methods can find out.

468
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:35.813
For instance,

469
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:40.170
soldiers need to understand men in order to understand themselves and their

470
00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:44.520
comrades and officers must learn how to interpret an influence,

471
00:30:44.521 --> 00:30:48.060
the conduct of those for whom they are responsible.

472
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.440
So this is exactly what I say,
old time.
If you want to be a good leader,

473
00:30:52.441 --> 00:30:57.340
you got to understand people.
The soldier must know about human needs,

474
00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:01.990
motives,
and emotions about fear when it comes,
what to do about it,
about anger,

475
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.410
when it is useful,
when it makes trouble about zest,

476
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:09.850
which is the core of good morale in a unit about anxiety and the sense of

477
00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:13.150
insecurity,
about indignation against the enemy,

478
00:31:13.151 --> 00:31:18.151
any irritation against comrades about the relation of food and have sex to

479
00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.690
military life.

480
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.960
He should know also of the relation of all these things to morale and thus learn

481
00:31:25.151 --> 00:31:29.230
how to avoid bad morale and to build up good morale

482
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:37.310
clearly.
And this is not just true for combat,
this is true for life.

483
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:41.570
Every soldier ought to understand further the problems of the mental adjustment

484
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.600
of men first to the army later to combat why men feel insecure.

485
00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.470
What makes for courage?
The signs of approaching breakdown,

486
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.610
how to prevent breakdown and what to do about it when it happens.

487
00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:01.410
The selection and training of leaders for the army has become one of the most

488
00:32:01.411 --> 00:32:04.650
important problems in the cycle in the psychology of war.

489
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.640
Not Enough is known about it,
but what is known to some should be known to.

490
00:32:08.641 --> 00:32:12.480
All the good leader is the man who builds up morale.

491
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.710
How does he do it?

492
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.240
What kind of man must he be if he is a poor leader,

493
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.220
can he become a better one?

494
00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:27.790
And there are mobs and panics to be understood to civilian mobs and panics may

495
00:32:28.551 --> 00:32:33.350
be the concern of the soldier when the populous gets mixed up with a fighting or

496
00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.410
when the enemy's homefront begins to break.

497
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.510
Panics may moreover occur in well-disciplined troops.

498
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.450
If all the conditions for panic are present.

499
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.790
What are these conditions?

500
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.780
Why are seasoned troops panicked less than green troops?

501
00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:57.780
The army place each man with his talents where he will be used to his best

502
00:32:58.661 --> 00:33:03.610
advantage,
but each individual must know how to get the most out of his talents.

503
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:10.660
The primitive fact of combat is that man pushes when he encounters an obstacle

504
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:16.430
to the achievement of his desire,
pushes more if blocked,

505
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:20.930
gets angry of still forwarded and then fights,

506
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:23.450
but to this fighting,

507
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:28.451
he eventually brings all of the knowledge and skill that has made him supreme

508
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:29.990
among the animals.

509
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:34.400
He fights by learning how to use his eyes at night and learning how to arrange a

510
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:36.920
system that will let him hear inside of an airplane.

511
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.030
He fights by selecting good leaders and good truck drivers.

512
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:46.390
He fights by understanding human nature in order to build up good morale that

513
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:48.770
will overcome fear.

514
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:54.840
He fights by saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the

515
00:33:54.841 --> 00:33:58.680
right time and sometimes that is propaganda.

516
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.370
He uses every resource of science and intelligence,

517
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.250
including psychology.
He has two,

518
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:10.490
four this is total war

519
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.010
I love.
They get about that,

520
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:22.430
about every aspect of your life is to be prepared for total war.

521
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.640
Which by the way,
you're in,
you know,

522
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:29.340
you might not be in combat at this moment in time,
but you're fighting,

523
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.760
you're fighting all the time and you have to bring every asset,

524
00:34:32.761 --> 00:34:34.860
every resource that you have available.

525
00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:38.250
You have to bring it to fight cause this is total war.

526
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.680
Now the book goes into some pretty big sections right here.

527
00:34:46.321 --> 00:34:51.321
One of them cite is a weapon or site as a weapon and then and then hearing as a

528
00:34:51.571 --> 00:34:56.571
tool and it literally talks about how to see better things you can do to make

529
00:34:57.211 --> 00:35:00.900
your night vision better,
how to preserve your night vision,

530
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.090
how to c sharp or just all those kinds of things.

531
00:35:03.091 --> 00:35:06.390
He talks about camouflage and stuff.
Real tactical stuff.

532
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.600
And then it talks about hearing and what you need to hear and how you can adjust

533
00:35:12.151 --> 00:35:15.630
your hearing and how to listen sharply.
And I'm gonna go,

534
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.430
I'm not going to talk about the site piece,

535
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.990
but I'm going to talk about the noise.

536
00:35:18.991 --> 00:35:22.860
There's just some interesting points about noise.
Loud sounds,

537
00:35:22.861 --> 00:35:26.760
especially when they are sudden in strange our natural causes of fear.

538
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.140
Many sounds are terrifying.

539
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.520
A sudden loud noise like the discharge of a pistol will make anyone blink and

540
00:35:33.521 --> 00:35:35.170
jump it.
We'll start with a limb.

541
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.960
This is true even well trained men who pride themselves on their familiarity

542
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:40.794
with firearms.

543
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.350
It is an instantaneous response that may be all over before the,

544
00:35:46.351 --> 00:35:48.390
I can see it.
It shows up.
However,

545
00:35:48.391 --> 00:35:53.391
in slow motion pictures seasoned troops get so that they don't appear to pay any

546
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:56.010
particular attention to the din of battle.

547
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.580
Even horses will stand still under the rising roar of a diving bomber will only

548
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:04.800
toss a head impatiently.

549
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:11.010
The experience soldier on the other hand needs first to become adapted to the

550
00:36:11.011 --> 00:36:12.180
noises of war.

551
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.020
He must be exposed to them in training as much as possible.

552
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.910
After the noise is become familiar,

553
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:21.090
it's loudness will not affect him so greatly in combat.

554
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.170
Control over noise makes it less fearful.

555
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.620
You don't mind the noise of gunfire so much as you are the one who is doing the

556
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:32.790
shooting.
So talking about brick,
getting people used to the,

557
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.920
the loud noises that you're gonna come up against.

558
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.110
And this is something that we used to do.

559
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.960
I don't even know if guys do it anymore cause it's probably not that smart.

560
00:36:39.961 --> 00:36:44.190
But we used to do immediate action drills with no ear protection in.

561
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.930
So we'd get used to shooting guns and having all that just massively loud noise.

562
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.970
And we wouldn't do it every time.

563
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.840
But we would do several rounds with no ear protection.
This is

564
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.590
now in current times.

565
00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:02.990
Guys have these nice headsets that have noise,
they're noise canceling headsets.

566
00:37:02.991 --> 00:37:06.720
So they're actually pretty awesome.
So it's not that big of a deal anymore.

567
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.420
But back in the day,
they wanted to make sure,
hey,

568
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:12.390
you gotta realize how loud this is going to be if you get in a firefight,

569
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.480
if you get your first firefight and you've never had a,

570
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.000
an [inaudible] machine gun two feet away from your ear,

571
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.450
get getting crazy laid down,
a hundred round belts,

572
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:24.460
it'll be a shock to your system.
So that's what,
and,

573
00:37:24.461 --> 00:37:27.250
and not to mention they're hucking grenades,

574
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.900
simulators at you and in artillery simulators.

575
00:37:29.901 --> 00:37:31.890
So there's explosions going off cause that's what,

576
00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.630
that's what they're trying to do.
Get you used to that scenario.
No

577
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.910
men subjected to the excessive noise of war over a long period.

578
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:46.911
Sometimes it build up an over sensitiveness to any sort of loud sharp report.

579
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:48.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

580
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.960
<v 0>They are in the state of a man with a hangover.</v>

581
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:55.220
The Bang of a door will make them jump.
A loud shout is painful.

582
00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:00.020
The noise of a truck exhaust is frightening in the hospitals where men are

583
00:38:00.021 --> 00:38:03.800
convalescing from bad cases of these war nerves.

584
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:09.320
The dropping of a Pan will startle a ward full of sleeping men so violently that

585
00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:09.831
the jerk,

586
00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:13.310
we'll bring them out of their sleep and even out of their beds and onto the

587
00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:16.720
floor.
But this state of nerves,

588
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.640
the linked in their minds with the noise and produced by the noise is due mainly

589
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:25.560
to more disturbing things that have become associated with the noise.

590
00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.610
Noise is just as loud and originally just as distressing as the noises of war.

591
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:36.010
If they are only just a part of everyday work or fund tolerated,

592
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.640
men become used to the din of a boiler factory or a pneumatic drill.

593
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:44.050
It may deafened them,
but it does not demoralize them.
So that's pretty obvious,

594
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:48.580
right?
What's,
what's making these noises horrible to use?

595
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:51.970
Cause every time a bomb goes off you see your friends get blown up and killed

596
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:53.950
and you're afraid that the same thing's going to happen to you.

597
00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.520
Whereas a pneumatic drill just making a bunch of noise or you're not that

598
00:38:57.521 --> 00:39:01.930
worried about it.
This was,

599
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.800
again,
there's a lot of real basic information.

600
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:08.350
You can imagine this book being issued to frontline troops,

601
00:39:08.351 --> 00:39:13.300
but I had to call this one out here to sooner or later most soldiers have the

602
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:17.860
experience of getting lost in heavy words are jumbled as possibly get lost a few

603
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.450
yards,
just a few yards off the trail.

604
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.610
It gives a man a peculiar helpless feeling.

605
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:30.410
You are so accustom all your life to knowing where you are and who you are and

606
00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:34.840
about what time it is that the feeling of not knowing what of these things comes

607
00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:35.860
as a great shock.

608
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.280
And then it goes on a little from the,

609
00:39:40.281 --> 00:39:44.830
it says a compass is a big help and I was like,
hmm,
yeah,
yes it is indeed.

610
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.690
There's another real captain,

611
00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:50.680
obvious it is best to have a map in your pocket when you get lost.

612
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.910
If you can't have one,

613
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.730
then you ought to see one before you get into strange country.

614
00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.840
So that's real obvious to the Mora soldier knows about maps,

615
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.991
better equip,

616
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:06.700
he is for combat duty is training and how to read them and what to look for on

617
00:40:06.701 --> 00:40:10.510
them if he keeps practicing,
should enable him to find himself.

618
00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:11.950
If he ever gets lost on any terrain,

619
00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:15.880
he knows from map and the reason I called that part out is think about all the

620
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:20.881
situations that you get in where you have the opportunity to gather some

621
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:23.440
intelligence before you go into them.
You know,

622
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:25.960
if you're going for a job interview,
what can you do about that company?

623
00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.060
If you're going to meet with a client you've never met with before,

624
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.540
how much information can you have with these days?
You can Google,

625
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:35.170
so when you get all kinds of information,
you go to their linkedin account,

626
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:38.440
you can find out where they went to school and what sport they play it or

627
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:42.670
whatever.
You go to their Facebook page,
you go to their give,

628
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:44.290
pull up articles that were written about them,

629
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:46.420
and there's all kinds of intelligence you can gather.

630
00:40:46.421 --> 00:40:50.890
There's no reason to go into a meeting blind anymore without knowing the terrain

631
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:53.320
that you're getting into without understanding the culture that you're going

632
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:54.340
into.
There's no reason for it.

633
00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:01.080
Next work in the army as much more than just shouldering a rifle and doing long

634
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:02.260
foot marches.

635
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:07.180
Soldiers work at several hundred different kinds of fighting jobs and add even

636
00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:08.380
more kinds of jobs,

637
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:12.460
some directly related to combat in some not which can be filled with men already

638
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:16.480
trained for them or men who have the necessary aptitude for learning.

639
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.340
One of the jobs quickly.

640
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.120
All leaders have the responsibility for seeing that the right man gets the right

641
00:41:22.121 --> 00:41:26.560
job.
And when mistakes are made,
that misfits are transferred.

642
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.170
And this thing is this where this book gets pretty politically incorrect.

643
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.580
It's basically,
look,
some people can't do this jobs.

644
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.000
Some people aren't fit for these jobs and some people aren't fit for these other

645
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:38.490
jobs.

646
00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:39.323
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

647
00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.830
<v 0>Continuing on thousands know how to drive a tractor,</v>

648
00:41:43.831 --> 00:41:47.820
how to repair an ignition system.
Others can weld castings,
repair watches,

649
00:41:47.821 --> 00:41:51.270
other timing instruments or road transits.
Keep accounts,

650
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.780
carve carcasses of beef,
develop photographs.

651
00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:58.290
The army needs many men who can do these things.

652
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.490
The British found that out in the first world war.
At first,

653
00:42:02.491 --> 00:42:05.190
they neglected to save their specialists.

654
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.980
They sent to the front professional men,

655
00:42:07.981 --> 00:42:10.920
engineers and men and skilled trades.

656
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:14.100
Many were killed in the early months of the war.
Later,

657
00:42:14.101 --> 00:42:18.840
the need for them in special posts behind the line became a cute.

658
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:20.431
So,
yeah,

659
00:42:20.431 --> 00:42:25.431
this is all about forming up an army of civilians that have skills and saying,

660
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.190
oh,
you've been a truck driver for whatever for six years in the civilian sector.

661
00:42:29.191 --> 00:42:32.100
Guess what you're going to do for us?
You're going to drive a truck.
Oh,

662
00:42:32.101 --> 00:42:35.310
you're a butcher.
Guess what?
We need butchers and right on down the line,

663
00:42:35.311 --> 00:42:40.030
and you can imagine world war one,
probably them.
That being very shortsighted.

664
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.380
It'll how long that Warren was going to last him like,
oh,
oh,

665
00:42:43.381 --> 00:42:45.630
you're a mechanic.
Cool.

666
00:42:45.631 --> 00:42:48.800
We're just going to send you the front with everyone else and you're going to

667
00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:50.040
die like everyone else,

668
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:54.120
and you look up in six months or a year and they don't have the necessary

669
00:42:54.121 --> 00:42:57.530
support logistically to carry on the war.
Hmm.

670
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.960
How soldiers differ?

671
00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.870
Men differ just as much.

672
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:10.880
Inability to learn different sorts of duties as they do in size of feet in

673
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:12.260
height or in weight.

674
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.630
Some are as much as three times as able as others.

675
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.200
I like that.
Hey,
some people are just three times more capable than you.

676
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.790
That's the way it is.
Most of course are just about average.

677
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.170
Some men cannot learn a three,

678
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.630
a three figure telephone number by hearing it once some can learn as many as

679
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:39.410
nine figures.
The average is around six or seven.
Have you ever heard that before?

680
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.530
Have you ever heard that the reason our numbers are seven digits long is cause

681
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:45.410
that's about the average that a human can memorize.
No,

682
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.820
I haven't and that's very interesting.
I heard that it could that possibly be

683
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:56.330
not bro Science,
but uh,
urban myth.
Could it be an urban legend?

684
00:43:56.331 --> 00:44:00.810
It could be.
It's true.
I like it.
Yeah,
it was awesome.
Actually.
Will you,

685
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.280
will you have your doctorate in Bro Science?
So I'm working on it.
Yes.
Yes.

686
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:09.050
You did.
You do your Undergrad in,
uh,
urban legend.

687
00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.290
Uh,
back to the book.

688
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:20.150
Some men starting from scratch can learn in eight weeks to receive and send

689
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:22.910
radio code at 16 words per minute.

690
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.480
It takes others 22 weeks.

691
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:31.260
Some men used to handling certain types of machinery can learn to handle certain

692
00:44:31.261 --> 00:44:34.020
kinds of weapons much faster than others.

693
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.770
So the problem is to understand and measure aptitude.

694
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.900
Aptitude is potential skill.

695
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.310
The capacity for learning to do something quickly and accurately when given the

696
00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:49.230
chance to learn.
Both speed and accuracy are important in learning.

697
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:51.690
A soldier needs to learn rapidly,

698
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:56.691
but also to be accurate at what he's learned and men different differ from one

699
00:44:57.151 --> 00:45:02.130
to another in both ways.
For one thing,

700
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:05.520
men differ greatly in the speed with which they learned.

701
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.930
Some aviation cadets can solo solo after four hours of instruction.

702
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.570
Others are not allowed to so low,
even after 14 hours.
Here,

703
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.830
the quick learners are urgently needed.

704
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:22.580
Slow learners tie up the training fate planes too long besides quick learning

705
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.630
might mean a shorter warm,

706
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.760
yet the armory cannot do without the slow learners.

707
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:35.300
Manpower is needed and there are many military jobs which require other

708
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:37.700
qualities than speed of learning jobs,

709
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:41.010
which the slow learners will prefer to have.

710
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:45.810
Men also differ in speed and accuracy of reaction.

711
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.790
The average driver requires from one half to three quarters of a second to put

712
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:53.280
on the brakes after the stop light goes red.

713
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.090
Yet some can apply the brakes in three tenths of a second.

714
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.460
Others use up to a whole second.

715
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.680
These are important differences for riflemen and machine gunners as well as for

716
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:07.890
truck drivers.
Every 10th of a second counts in battle.

717
00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.630
They were see that thing when they were um,

718
00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:17.000
<v 3>they would do in like the speed tests for Conor McGregor.
Then he was the,</v>

719
00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.210
he was the fastest athlete.
They had tested speed,

720
00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:22.970
like reaction kind of like reaction time.

721
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.910
Like when you see something you touch a button or whatever,
you know,
whatever.

722
00:46:25.911 --> 00:46:27.080
They have these little tests set up.

723
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.800
Then apparently Mcgregor was the fastest athlete that they had tested,

724
00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.550
which is crazy.
Yeah,
it is crazy.
It is crazy.

725
00:46:34.551 --> 00:46:38.360
Cause you know some of these baseball players and I guess I think,

726
00:46:38.361 --> 00:46:39.380
I think that would be the,

727
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.230
do you think that would be the fastest Hyandai coordination?

728
00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.970
I don't tell them my head seems like it.
I mean cause those balls come quick.

729
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.810
Yeah.
Yeah.

730
00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:53.660
There is a test that you can do when we're kids wa how they do in science class.

731
00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.500
You hold one guy,
you know,
they,

732
00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.860
you get a ruler.
Oh yeah.
And then drop it.
Yeah.

733
00:47:00.861 --> 00:47:04.040
The teacher holds it and then you put it,
he puts it on your finger,
you know,

734
00:47:04.041 --> 00:47:05.810
between your fingers.
Right at the,

735
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:08.720
at the zero mark he dropped it and how quick you can.

736
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:10.820
How far do your fingers have to be opened?

737
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.670
I don't know cause it seems like that could be an advantage.

738
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:18.710
My grandfather used to do this,
well it's called the dollar drop.

739
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:19.551
Okay.

740
00:47:19.551 --> 00:47:24.380
And he would fold a dollar lengthwise only to make it kind of aerodynamic.

741
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.740
If you could catch the dollar,
you could,
you could keep it.
Okay.

742
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.010
It sounds pretty easy.
It,
yes sir.
It

743
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.650
<v 4>does.
Some people can't catch that dollar.
Yeah.
So you think if you're,
you know,</v>

744
00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.780
uh,
you know how you're saying,
you just said how far your fingers.
Yeah.

745
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:42.970
The thing is for the experiment,
as long as you designate kind of that,

746
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.260
you know,
or even eyeball it,
you know,
I mean it might be a millimeter difference,

747
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.460
but you know,

748
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.550
usually it's like there's always those people that are looking for that edge.

749
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:54.790
Right.
Is Jocko.
Yes.

750
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.450
Because I'm thinking I would be figuring out how,

751
00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:01.330
cause I used to do that with a dollar drop.
Right.
I'd get my fingers here.
Yes.

752
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:04.210
That makes sense.
When the,
you know,
the dog has more stakes for sure.

753
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:06.543
Pulls out that

754
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:11.860
you're really the guy in science class who wanted to win though,

755
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.980
even though it wasn't a competition.
Of course it's a competition.

756
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.360
<v 0>So in,
I don't know,</v>

757
00:48:21.361 --> 00:48:23.940
I'm pretty sure that that stuff can be trained as well.

758
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:28.650
And that's one thing that um,
you know,
we,
when you're bringing your kids up,

759
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:31.590
you bring them up and you make them play multiple different sports.

760
00:48:31.591 --> 00:48:34.380
You don't feel cause some too young because they become,
they don't,

761
00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.200
they don't develop the broader athletic skills.

762
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.920
So you're supposed to get them involved in a bunch of different sports and those

763
00:48:43.681 --> 00:48:46.500
kids will end up,
even if he took one kid and you say,
oh,

764
00:48:46.501 --> 00:48:48.600
did you just going to do a hundred percent football his whole life?

765
00:48:48.601 --> 00:48:51.780
And you took another kid and you did multiple sports and but you did like a

766
00:48:51.781 --> 00:48:53.310
little bit more of a focus on football.

767
00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:58.730
The chances are they kid that did multiple sports but focused on football is

768
00:48:58.801 --> 00:49:02.490
going to do better than the kid that just did football.
From what I understand,

769
00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:05.490
I'm sure there's some bro Science people out there that will uh,

770
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:08.220
object to my statement.

771
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.090
<v 4>Oh it makes sense.
You know where it's brought more broadly athletic and pre,</v>

772
00:49:13.091 --> 00:49:16.630
I'd imagine you'd be able to learn quicker too because your body is used to

773
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.850
moving different ways rather than just a one way.

774
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.880
<v 0>What are you going to do with things are a little bit different out on the</v>

775
00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:23.230
football field,
right?

776
00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:26.920
Cause little situations that can unfold it if you're athletically adept at

777
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:30.520
adapting to various situations are going to be better off.
Yeah,
it's true.

778
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:33.363
Going on,

779
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:37.810
men differ also in the speed and accuracy of perceiving.

780
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:42.700
One clerk can check in five minutes accompany roster.

781
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:44.650
That takes another man 20 minutes.

782
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:49.090
Some men can see a white target in the dark at 400 yards away to others.

783
00:49:49.091 --> 00:49:50.080
It is invisible.

784
00:49:50.081 --> 00:49:54.640
At 200 yards rangefinders differ in their ability to tell the distances of

785
00:49:54.641 --> 00:49:59.641
different objects when the job is seeing you must choose the best seniors.

786
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.060
So That's interesting cause you could have someone that has bad reactions but to

787
00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.360
see really well and if you ever read,

788
00:50:07.361 --> 00:50:10.630
I'm sure at some point we'll do chuck Yeager's book can hear back from matter of

789
00:50:10.631 --> 00:50:13.840
fact,
chuck Yeager's on Twitter,
I don't know if you know that,

790
00:50:13.841 --> 00:50:16.870
but chuck Yeager's on Twitter and I've gone back and forth a couple times.

791
00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:21.670
People have said come on the podcast,
but in his podcast or his book Yeager,

792
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.790
he just had incredible vision.

793
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:30.240
Like he'd be flying in formation and he could see the enemy way before anyone

794
00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:34.820
else could see the enemy.
He'd be like up bogeys at four o'clock,
boom,
we go.

795
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:38.270
And because his eyesight was apparently just amazing,

796
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.760
that used to be a big deal for fighter pilots.

797
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:45.761
I think it's less of a big deal now because you got radar and all that.

798
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.500
So it's not as big of a deal as it used to be.

799
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:51.950
Just your eyes against the enemy's eyes.

800
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.881
Back to the book.

801
00:50:55.881 --> 00:51:00.290
There is however much more to a good soldier than speed and accuracy with which

802
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:04.850
he learns acts and perceives every man has interests,

803
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.740
likes and dislikes.

804
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.040
These determined in part what he will do well and how fast he will improve a

805
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:15.980
man's interest.
For instance,
for instance,

806
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:20.780
usually determine what he will do with what he learns.

807
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:26.200
Mere exposure to training never made a skilled soldier.

808
00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:31.650
It is the interested man who remembers and profits by his training and is ready

809
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:37.280
to apply it to new situations.
Right?

810
00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:42.020
So it's so true how true.
It's just so true.
So true.

811
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:44.110
We don't,

812
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.990
and what I think is really important about this from a business perspective is

813
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.080
what they're basically saying is put the right people in the right jobs.

814
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:55.610
That's the overall concept of put the right people in the right jobs.

815
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.900
That's what you need to do.

816
00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.690
If you've got someone that might not be super talented,

817
00:51:59.691 --> 00:52:01.640
but they're very interested,

818
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:04.470
they're probably the better higher than someone that's just got a bunch of town

819
00:52:04.471 --> 00:52:07.190
but doesn't care.
In fact,
I'll go ahead and say they straight up are the better.

820
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:08.024
Higher.

821
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.750
<v 3>Yeah.
Cause it,
and then they'll,
they'll wind up learning like so quick.</v>

822
00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.440
And your specific thing,
you know,
you're specifically,
they're into it.

823
00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.600
If someone is not into it,
that's,
that's bad.
Oh,

824
00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:25.340
like someone who has like a major like degree and you know,
his resumes,

825
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:30.180
he honored degree but like,
Hey,
I'm really into whatever it is that you're doing.

826
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:34.230
Like for instance,
you like making videos,
gear into it,
right?
Sure.

827
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:35.610
If you didn't like,

828
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.780
<v 0>you know,
if you got no enjoyment from it,</v>

829
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.620
think of how horrible it would be

830
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:43.040
<v 3>to trying to get you to do it.
I mean,</v>

831
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:46.110
it's pretty hard to get you to do video right now and you're actually like doing

832
00:52:46.111 --> 00:52:50.100
it.
Yeah.
Or you know,
like,
um,

833
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.670
like politics.
Right.
You know how like some people they like politics,

834
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:57.600
some people don't.
So you get someone who likes politics and the news comes on,

835
00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:00.060
they're going to be all up in there learning everything.

836
00:53:00.061 --> 00:53:03.000
What's going on like today,
you know,
then someone who's not there,

837
00:53:03.001 --> 00:53:06.180
like all the news is on.
Let me watch.
Well that's an interesting,

838
00:53:06.181 --> 00:53:08.130
I thought you were going to say that people that are in DePaul,

839
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.170
because I actually have,

840
00:53:09.171 --> 00:53:13.320
that's one case where I would disagree because a lot of times people that really

841
00:53:13.321 --> 00:53:14.250
like politics,

842
00:53:14.251 --> 00:53:17.490
you don't want them in politics because they're just political machines.
Right?

843
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:21.600
You want a normal person.
Oh yeah.
He's just a normal everyday.

844
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:23.010
You don't want the person that's like,
you know what I'm gonna do,

845
00:53:23.011 --> 00:53:26.040
I'm gonna be precedent.
I'm going to be,
I'm going to in charge.
They like

846
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.860
<v 4>that person.
You don't remember to be president.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think and it's like,</v>

847
00:53:28.861 --> 00:53:32.190
look,
I don't really want to do this.
Yeah.
And I think the,
yeah,
that's different.

848
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:36.780
That's all hungry for the political life there,
there,
uh,
there,
uh,

849
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:40.560
arrogant person that thinks that they should be in charge of it.
It's like now,

850
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:44.960
yeah,
I don't watch like on TV,
like,
so like me,
if,
uh,

851
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.890
if I watch,
um,
I dunno.
Like,
okay.
So,

852
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:54.150
well that's kind of a good example cause I'm interested in Hawaii,
so you know,

853
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:58.980
I'm going to like,
but like,
okay,
so on,
so I make videos,
right?
80 some,

854
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.630
some visual effects,
whatever.

855
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:04.980
There's a youtube channel called video copilot,

856
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:09.540
right?
So all of us,
it's mainly just tutorials on how to do stuff.

857
00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:13.170
That's all it is really.
So when that,

858
00:54:13.171 --> 00:54:16.650
like if a new video comes out of something,
man,
I'm all up in there,
all up in it,

859
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:20.100
but you don't care.
You're going to watch that thing and you're going to,

860
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:23.620
you're going to,
you're not even going to click on it.
Not even close.
No.

861
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.960
See what I'm saying?
Unless I was like,
hm,

862
00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:29.370
I wonder if I'm going to take echoes job or yeah.
Or,
okay,
okay.
Case in point,

863
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:33.660
I'm not interested.
Right.
So I could barely even get through one of those videos.

864
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.050
I'd be like,
no,
I'm going to go over here and do burpees.
Yeah,
exactly.

865
00:54:37.051 --> 00:54:40.080
So you're going to click on that video.
If I say,
Hey Jocko,
click on this video.

866
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:43.800
This will make,
you know,
you're broadening your horizon.
I Dunno,
whatever,

867
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.570
click on this video and just watch the whole thing.
Watch it five times.

868
00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:51.420
Actually,
Bro,
when you're done watching it five times,
it's bad.

869
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.090
Everything went over your head.
Don't care.
You don't even care.

870
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:59.550
<v 0>So advice from this book is put people that are interested in the job,</v>

871
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.910
truly,
inherently interested in,
they're going to do a better work.

872
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.030
Even then maybe someone that's more talented than then they are

873
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.840
back to the book.

874
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:15.300
Other personal differences besides interests and likes and dislikes are

875
00:55:15.301 --> 00:55:19.290
important,
especially for some military tasks.
One may feel,

876
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.760
one man may feel completely at ease in the transparent cage in which a

877
00:55:23.761 --> 00:55:28.761
bombardier must sit while another ordinarily dextrous is so upset in the exposed

878
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:36.171
position that the pupils of his eyes dilate his fingers fumble and he cannot

879
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:38.520
manipulate the bom site properly.

880
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.120
<v 4>So there you go.
You've got a guy that's probably a better,</v>

881
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:44.890
maybe he has quicker reaction times,

882
00:55:44.891 --> 00:55:46.600
but he's just scared to be inside the turret.

883
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.180
<v 0>Two equally wise,</v>

884
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:55.140
officers may not be equally good leaders.

885
00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:00.000
One is at ease with his men,
talking with them freely,

886
00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:02.640
getting their slant on matters of importance.

887
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:07.110
And giving his orders and directions readily.
The other,

888
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.940
although he wants his men to like him and respond alertly and willingly to him

889
00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:12.630
as a leader,

890
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:17.070
cannot bring himself to feel free and confident with them and open up with them

891
00:56:17.071 --> 00:56:20.550
in a way to gain their confidence and liking in turn.

892
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.560
The first is of course the better leader,

893
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.020
<v 3>so then there you go.
That's like straight up,
hey,
this person,</v>

894
00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:30.640
if you're more comfortable talking to your troops,

895
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:33.190
they're going to sense that and you're going to be better than someone that's

896
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:37.440
comfortable talking to the troops.
Indeed,

897
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:41.320
leadership is the quality that the army most needs.

898
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:43.450
All advancement brings with it.

899
00:56:43.451 --> 00:56:48.451
Responsibility and responsibility for the conduct of others requires leadership.

900
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:56.170
That's interesting because what's interesting about that is that is,

901
00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.920
and it goes into this later on talking about the,

902
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:03.010
we probably won't cover it until the next podcast on this book,

903
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:05.140
but talking about the,
you know,

904
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.740
are leaders born or made and this is clearly leaning a little bit towards born

905
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:16.810
clearly,
which I agree with.
I think leaders are born and made.

906
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:17.980
Yeah,
it's both.

907
00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:22.000
It feels like a lot of times when people use the expression are they born,

908
00:57:22.001 --> 00:57:25.420
whether it be leaders,
whether it be whatever,
you know he's a natural whatever.

909
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:30.610
Um,
I get the expression and I understand and agree of course,

910
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:35.470
but technically like if you say if a leader is made or born,

911
00:57:35.471 --> 00:57:40.120
born meaning like he wasn't trained at a very specific point to be a leader.

912
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:45.100
He brought to the training or to the position just a bunch of like talent or

913
00:57:45.101 --> 00:57:47.680
whatever.
But he probably learned that through like his life,

914
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:49.460
what he was exposed to,
what he was,
you know.

915
00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:55.110
But there are certain aptitudes that people have and those play an impact.

916
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.820
If you have somebody that's really articulate,

917
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:02.890
they're going to make a better writer than someone that's not her.

918
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.490
But even someone who's articulate,
they,
they learn that through sort of life.

919
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:07.840
There's no possibly,

920
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:12.900
but some of it maybe there's like a shorter tongue or something because it has

921
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:15.970
to be genetic is what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.

922
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:17.770
I don't know if there's an articulate gene.

923
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:21.280
There is an articulate gene for sure north on a gene.
It's your brain,

924
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:24.790
how much capacity do you have the process words quickly and assemble them

925
00:58:24.791 --> 00:58:29.260
together into sentences and put them out to comprehendable statement?

926
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.660
How can you do that?
How well can you do that?
Yeah,

927
00:58:31.661 --> 00:58:35.280
but you're not born knowing how to to I guess.
Yeah,
like a process and have the,

928
00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.740
yeah.
You have what?
Yeah,
that's it.

929
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:41.410
What process or what size processors or do you have in your,
in your brain,

930
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:46.440
you've got the old four 86 was or do you got the new pentium,

931
00:58:49.481 --> 00:58:53.680
whatever was probably like 10 years old.
Pentium,
you know,

932
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.700
it's like a I seven or eight nine.
I have no idea.
Anyway,
but no,

933
00:58:57.701 --> 00:59:00.820
because there's articulate people who don't talk fast or don't.
Yeah.

934
00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:04.840
That's able to assemble there.
Okay.
Here's another one,

935
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.570
and this ones,
and I've talked about these before,

936
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:11.740
but the ability to look at complex problems and simplify them.
Yeah,
sure.

937
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:15.100
Some of that is learned,
some people just are born with it.

938
00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:19.840
Some people learn it in the streets.
Street.
Yeah.

939
00:59:19.841 --> 00:59:22.340
I think my,
my,

940
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:26.420
I'm drawing back on my Bruce Saints background and I do think,

941
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:28.280
I believe I'm under,

942
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:34.010
I believe it's a belief that you get it from like,
like,

943
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:39.100
like your guarantee if you take someone that had a twin brother yeah.

944
00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:46.280
And,
and you,
one of them would be more apt at some things than the other one.

945
00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:51.470
There's gotta be some things that you are better at than your brother naturally

946
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:55.250
and some things that your brother is better at.
The new,
I don't know of any,

947
00:59:55.251 --> 00:59:58.610
but the,
I mean,
put it this way,
all the differences that we have,

948
00:59:58.611 --> 01:00:02.870
I feel like I can map it back to why because just being second born,

949
01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:06.940
I was born in a little bit smaller to now look at me like a bigger,
I'm like,

950
01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.250
I don't want to be here.
Especially people would compare to,
you know,

951
01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:11.540
like growing up with a twin brother,

952
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:16.400
they always compare like all he's little bit tall.
Anyone yes.
Or whatever.

953
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:19.050
Oh yeah.
And the training that no more are there

954
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.010
anyway.
The point is,
I'm not saying,
I'm not saying you're,
I think you brew,

955
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:32.000
you're probably right,
of course,
but
I think it's mostly learned,

956
01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:32.810
bro.

957
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:37.810
People have a certain genetic cognitive capacity without question.

958
01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.500
Yeah.
That's not even debatable.
Yes,
I would not to be.

959
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:47.360
So what we're talking about is the ability to take that cognitive capacity and

960
01:00:47.361 --> 01:00:50.090
steer it towards the articulation of language.

961
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:52.700
If you have more cognitive capacity,

962
01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:55.160
you will be able to articulate language better.

963
01:00:55.430 --> 01:01:00.430
And there's probably little modules inside the brain that are genetic that have

964
01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:05.591
even more capacity for the grabbing and assembling of linguistic patterns

965
01:01:07.941 --> 01:01:12.941
together where they flow off the tongue rapidly and sensibly.

966
01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:17.630
And there's got to be part of your brain that's better at that just genetically.

967
01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:22.580
Now,
of course,
if you spend a lot of time in that arena,

968
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.110
you will get better at it over time.
But there's gotta be some,

969
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:32.111
just like you have x amount of fast twitch muscle and Echo Charles,

970
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.180
like how hard did you work at your vertical jump?
Did you guys test that?

971
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:41.450
And Football?
Yes.
Okay.
What was the highest vertical jump you ever had?

972
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.440
39 and a half.
Okay.
That's pretty good.
Right?

973
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:50.240
Is there a war there,
people on your team that worked harder than you,

974
01:01:50.241 --> 01:01:54.380
if not harder,
that never got to 39 and a half inches probably.
Yes.

975
01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.830
Actually yes.
Affirmative cause I didn't really work exactly.

976
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.320
I knew this is a loaded question.
So yes sir.

977
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.470
So someone,
there was someone on your team that they,

978
01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:10.280
they worked and they trained and they were doing jump squats and Bulgarian

979
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:13.790
lunges and split squats and they were just trying to get that vertical jump up.

980
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:17.280
They were wearing,
remember those shoes with the toes on them,

981
01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.120
get the mops when to get them hops.

982
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:25.320
So this guy had all those things and you already got to 32 inches.
Right?

983
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:29.370
And he goes,
he was bummed.
But,
but that's what I'm saying.

984
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.790
He has a certain genetic capability.

985
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.330
There's physical capabilities that are genetic and there's some,

986
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:41.690
some mental capabilities that are genetic and both of them have a max capacity.

987
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.440
And that dude with the,

988
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.430
the toe shoes for vertical jump improvement at warm.
Awesome.

989
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.910
And there was a kid one time,
he lived across the street from me and he,
you know,

990
01:02:53.911 --> 01:02:57.290
he's young.
He was,
this is when I was probably 25 hours in the day.

991
01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:58.440
It was back in the day.

992
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:02.910
But this kid train all summer long with those shoes.
And he was,

993
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:07.020
he what he wanted to do is dunk a basketball and he did it.
He did it eventually,

994
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:09.660
but he worked hard.

995
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.760
There are some people that don't even have to work hard and they can dunk a

996
01:03:11.761 --> 01:03:14.880
basketball.
They're just got it.
Yeah man.
Yeah man.

997
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:17.340
My friend cake nuts who I mentioned Ken cake nuts.

998
01:03:17.341 --> 01:03:20.600
Don't know who we're talking about.
Some,
some different attributes now.
Um,

999
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:25.650
he was like,
he always had like kind of like big,
it's called big muscle bellies,

1000
01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:29.740
like the party,
your muscle.
Anyway,
he had kind of big muscle genetic use,

1001
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.710
a thinner guy,
but,
and he was always cut.

1002
01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:36.090
So even into adulthood he wouldn't have to watch his diet and you know,

1003
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:39.270
meanwhile if it like a normal person,
if you watch your diet like a lot,

1004
01:03:39.271 --> 01:03:43.220
then you can get that cut.
You can get there all.
Yeah,
totally can.
But cake nuts.

1005
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.420
He's just cruising,
just shred,
you know,

1006
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.850
and then he like lifts a bunch of weights over the summer.
Who working on,

1007
01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:54.660
I gave him by the way and he listened,
but he comes back and he's just huge,

1008
01:03:54.661 --> 01:03:59.160
still got by the way.
So it's like Dang.
But you know,
he just has it like that.

1009
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.053
There you go.

1010
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.870
Genetic genetic differences and that's what they're talking about in this book.

1011
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.340
And I think sometimes people's attitude nowadays,
it's like,
well,
you know,

1012
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.370
you can do whatever you want.
Well took.
No,

1013
01:04:11.371 --> 01:04:13.440
actually you should find out what's good for you.

1014
01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.760
That's what you should look for me.
Yeah.
Like I was a radio man.
You know,

1015
01:04:17.761 --> 01:04:20.100
it's like a radio man.
Why?
Cause I was like smart,

1016
01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:22.320
but I was big enough to carry a radio.
Right?

1017
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:25.440
If the small guys and a seal platoon,
they become the point man,

1018
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:29.490
because you don't have to carry any extra weight.
Gentleman,
you're so right.

1019
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:30.301
Like so.
Right.

1020
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:35.301
And consider like major industries and we'll just say sports,

1021
01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:39.330
right?
Where it's like,
it's pretty clear when you win,
you win.
When you lose,

1022
01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:42.750
you lose sports,
right?
So get the established sports

1023
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.480
with very,
very few exceptions is going to be the case.
You're going to get like,

1024
01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:49.530
okay,
football,

1025
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:52.110
because there's a bunch of positions that do very different things.

1026
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.100
The tight end,
he's going to be a certain bill.

1027
01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.270
Generally it's for sure the quarterback is going to be a certain build and

1028
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:57.940
receiver.
Her,

1029
01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.610
me certain build the center and the line certain built like you grab a guy from

1030
01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:03.390
the line guard,
right?
One of the guys in the line,

1031
01:05:03.391 --> 01:05:08.391
you put him on defense as like a cornerback or something who needs literally

1032
01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:12.390
opposite after do that too.
It happened.
So no,
no,
no.
Just train them,

1033
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:16.140
train on for 10 years,
no negative.
Probably make him better.

1034
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:18.700
But you to make him successful.
Exactly.
Right.
So it's like,

1035
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.310
it's such a clear example just because there's more on the line with that,

1036
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:23.860
you know?
So if you're a youngster,

1037
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:28.690
you should look at your attributes and see number one where your attributes fit

1038
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:31.690
and then what your interests are.
Sometimes people get,

1039
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.890
they're super interested and so they just try for it anyways,
you know?

1040
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:38.560
And that's cool.
That's cool.
There's,

1041
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:42.580
there's some people that we get really good at a sport but they're still not

1042
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:46.030
good enough to go pro because they don't have the genetic

1043
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.360
gifts that are needed.

1044
01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:54.100
And that's why it's so prevalent in such a like big deal when you do find that

1045
01:05:54.101 --> 01:05:57.850
like the super rare guy where it's like,
hey,
he's not really genetically gifted,

1046
01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:02.660
but he works so hard that he made it.
Absolutely.

1047
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.780
That's like a guy in basketball who's like not tall,
not fast.

1048
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:12.130
Yeah.
Yeah.
But he was pubes pretty fast though.

1049
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.210
And he could jump or well,
but he's small.
You know,
it's interesting,

1050
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.470
I was talking to Dallas,
who's the coach of the goals,

1051
01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:24.970
the San Diego goals hockey team.
But a few years ago,

1052
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.950
not very long,
the hockey had become all these big giant guys,
you know,

1053
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:34.900
six,
four,
six,
five,
260 pounds.
He's big monster guys.

1054
01:06:34.901 --> 01:06:37.790
And that's where everyone had started going in that direction.
All the team,

1055
01:06:37.791 --> 01:06:40.390
there's getting bigger because you guys are massive and they can hate hard.

1056
01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:44.770
And then recently it started going back again to guys that were smaller and

1057
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:49.240
quicker and could move faster.
So that's an interesting evolution,

1058
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:52.750
but you can look at it,
you could have looked at it,
you know,

1059
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:54.970
four years ago or whenever it was,
I don't really know.

1060
01:06:55.660 --> 01:07:00.130
But 10 years ago or whatever,
when you were five 11,
you're like,
Oh man,

1061
01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:03.640
I'm not big enough to play pro hockey.
But some kids were like,
you know what,

1062
01:07:03.641 --> 01:07:06.520
I'm five 11 and be fast.
Maybe faster than everyone.
Okay,
cool.

1063
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:10.780
And he made it and now they're in the game.
Yeah.
Makes Sense.
Yeah.

1064
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:15.781
I'm not as familiar with like the necessities of being a good hockey player or

1065
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:21.140
team as far as the physical attributes.
Um,
but like football,
I used that,

1066
01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:26.020
that example because the jobs of each position are so different.

1067
01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.260
I mean not each position,
but like the differences between,
you know,

1068
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:32.020
like a quarterback wide receiver and then the difference between that and like

1069
01:07:32.021 --> 01:07:36.220
all line men.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So like basketball is different.

1070
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.470
Even though they have different positions where everyone has to Sorta,

1071
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:43.570
generally speaking,
of course there's exceptions,
but everyone's going to be tall.

1072
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.110
No one's going to be like slow.
If you're like slow,

1073
01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.120
it's like that's a big kind of deal,
you know?

1074
01:07:49.121 --> 01:07:52.480
So everyone's a little bit more uniform.
Yeah.
Hockey scene or the same way.
Yeah.

1075
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.090
More uniform.
Hockey's more uniform.

1076
01:07:55.180 --> 01:08:00.180
Seal platoon is not uniform because you've got a big 60 gunner gunner,

1077
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:03.850
but,
but you know what?
Not all paid gunners are big.
Yeah.

1078
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.170
Cause you can just be a tough 162 pound pig.

1079
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.620
Just king.
Just kid grind it out.

1080
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:16.220
Appointments usually a little bit smaller,
but that's,
but when you get to a seal

1081
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:20.240
<v 0>team,
guys look at you and you're like,
oh you're,
you're five,
seven year,</v>

1082
01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:22.400
140 pounds.
You're going to be appointment.

1083
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:24.620
That's the way it's going to work most of the time.

1084
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:27.410
Sometimes you get them in a platoon and they're like,
we already got appointment.

1085
01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:29.390
Dude,
you're going to carry a pig here.

1086
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:31.760
You go buck up and start doing some squats.
Moly.

1087
01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.140
All right.
Personality.

1088
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:39.470
It takes more than brains to make a good soldier.
It takes guts,

1089
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:44.050
it takes endurance,
it takes a willingness to do hard work.
It takes a,

1090
01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.820
a keen interest in doing the job well.

1091
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:52.120
Psychologists wish they could give the army right now a method of measuring

1092
01:08:52.851 --> 01:08:57.851
these important pat personality assets tests that would be as accurate and

1093
01:08:57.981 --> 01:09:02.981
reliable as a test for measuring the ability to do arithmetic or aptitude for

1094
01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:06.680
learning radio code.
They can't,

1095
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.270
some tests had been tried,
many have been found useless.

1096
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:16.010
Few are promising.
You know what's interesting,
I just thought of this,

1097
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.630
I went to communication school,
the,

1098
01:09:19.631 --> 01:09:24.631
the seal communication school and we had to learn Morse code and there was one,

1099
01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:30.620
I was probably 20 guys in my comms course and we all had to learn Morse code and

1100
01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:36.110
this was very clear that some people were better at it than others cause you had

1101
01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:38.330
to,
and we didn't have to send very fast,
we,

1102
01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:42.140
but we had to be able to receive like a certain amount of groups.

1103
01:09:42.141 --> 01:09:43.550
It's called the group.
It's five,

1104
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:48.340
five letters in a group and they would just come back to d two d d d d d d d Dee

1105
01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:48.360
Dee.

1106
01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.060
And you had to be able to receive and write down what the letters were with no

1107
01:09:53.061 --> 01:09:55.850
mistakes.
But what's interesting is we all showed up.

1108
01:09:55.851 --> 01:10:00.170
No one knew any morse code when we showed up and there was a complete bell curve

1109
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:03.470
when we got done,
you know,
some guys were really good at it naturally.

1110
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:08.650
Some guys were horrible at it and it took every ounce of mental power for them

1111
01:10:09.561 --> 01:10:12.650
to figure out and get to be able to pass the test.

1112
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:16.310
And I had a crazy guy that was teaching the comm school and someone would be

1113
01:10:16.311 --> 01:10:19.460
like,
hey,
um,
chief,
why do we have to learn,
you know,

1114
01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:23.040
Morris Code since no one uses it anymore.
He'd go and he'd say,
ah,

1115
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:26.620
in the event of a nuclear holocaust,
Morse code,

1116
01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.380
<v 4>ms,
the only thing that's going to be punching through the ionosphere,</v>

1117
01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:34.350
and of course I was 18 years old and I was like,
oh dude,
that's right.
Right on.

1118
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.770
I was,
my interest was piqued.
I was like,
Hey,
in event of a nuclear holocaust,

1119
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.940
I'm going to be on the HF radio hammer and out Morris code to the troops.

1120
01:10:42.941 --> 01:10:47.680
Let them know what's up.
Well,
that makes sense.
How was stupid?
I was what we,

1121
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.070
what it means to what you don't agree with that?
No,
dude,

1122
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:52.330
if there's a nuclear holocaust,
I wouldn't be alive.

1123
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.970
Well what if we would be dead?
But you,

1124
01:10:53.971 --> 01:10:57.340
you know what if you're like one of the only survivors or survivors like me,

1125
01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:01.990
but it's so man,
that's interesting that that where you'd have to,

1126
01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:04.150
I mean that small little thing that you just said where you have to,

1127
01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:08.110
it's less about putting it out.
It's more about receiving cause worst code.

1128
01:11:08.111 --> 01:11:11.370
You don't communicate necessarily pickers.
The reason I'm to,

1129
01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:14.280
here's the reasoning behind it.
If you want to send

1130
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.120
<v 3>Morse code,</v>

1131
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.500
you can send at whatever pace you want is the people are just going to sit there

1132
01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:23.010
and take the letters that your son did,
right?
They're not saying hurry up.

1133
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.360
So you can send it whatever pace you want,
but receiving,

1134
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.930
you gotta be ready and I forget what the minimum standard.
I think it,

1135
01:11:29.931 --> 01:11:32.430
well I want to say it was 20 groups of minute or something like that.

1136
01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:36.480
You want to pass?
You mean like not passing and I forget,
I forget,

1137
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:40.260
but we weren't as good as like a regular navy guy who would just be,

1138
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:42.000
I don't even know what,
but they way faster.

1139
01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:44.040
We were like knuckle draggers compared to them.

1140
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:48.030
We had to learn every day and you had to do it every day and to test it out.

1141
01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.370
And some people test it out in a few weeks.

1142
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.260
Some people didn't test out until the,
you know,
the last days sitting,

1143
01:11:55.261 --> 01:11:59.970
there's nuclear wars code gets,
do you,
you still know Morse code?

1144
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:04.410
Not really.
What if he came in at like beep?
No,

1145
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.190
I would need to brush up on it and brush up on it and which I need to do because

1146
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:12.180
if there is a nuclear holocaust,
I want to be,
you know,
ready to get comms out,

1147
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.670
HF coms and receive them.
Of course,
you know?
Yeah.

1148
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.580
Check.
But it's such a clear example of,
and the guys,

1149
01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:24.690
it wasn't like on that bell curve of guys that were good and bad.

1150
01:12:24.691 --> 01:12:29.691
It wasn't like everyone that was a good seal was up at the top and the guys that

1151
01:12:30.781 --> 01:12:32.760
weren't good at Morse code were bad seals.
No,

1152
01:12:32.761 --> 01:12:36.450
it was like some of the guys were awesome guys and they sucked it Morse code and

1153
01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:39.150
some guys were marginal guys,
but they were great in Morse code.

1154
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:42.390
And there is a perfect example,
like what do you do with that guy?

1155
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:44.670
And we'll put them in to make them a radio man.
You know?

1156
01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:49.770
That's interesting that he,
I kicked nuts when he was going through,

1157
01:12:49.771 --> 01:12:54.720
I think it was bud.
No,
no,
no.
It was after buds.
He,
he kept saying like,
man,

1158
01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:57.740
actually my other friend Jeremy was telling me that,
oh yeah,

1159
01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.240
he's good at pretty much everything.

1160
01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:03.810
He's just really good at stuff except for picking locks.

1161
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:06.120
It was like struggling with like bigger locks,

1162
01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:09.180
which is kind of a random thing to struggle with.
Picking locks is,

1163
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:11.430
is a difficult thing and it's a,

1164
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:17.390
it's more like playing a musical instrument that it is like doing a technical

1165
01:13:18.391 --> 01:13:23.340
skill where you do a,
B,
c and you get d no picking locks is like,

1166
01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:26.700
you're gonna to feel a little art man.
You got a feel for it.

1167
01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:29.610
And I've been with guys,
I was okay at picking locks.

1168
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:35.220
The guy that I learned from was,
he could walk up and put the,

1169
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:37.110
you know,
walk up to indoor Auburn stand,

1170
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:41.370
not facing it and just stand there and just pick the lock open in seconds.

1171
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.250
It's pretty incredible.
Kind of like on that,
that movie,

1172
01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:48.390
the Italian job you ever launched to that?
No,
he has a good one.
So this girl,

1173
01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:51.870
she was like the safe cracker,
like a den of thieves.

1174
01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.480
They're this group of the safe cracker.
Yes.

1175
01:13:55.710 --> 01:14:00.150
Her Dad was cracker.
It was like a genetic thing.

1176
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:04.700
They're good,
you know.
So the dad passed it onto the,
you know,
it's like genetics.

1177
01:14:04.701 --> 01:14:06.840
Some people,
that's how you know.
Yeah.

1178
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.070
Maybe the learned behavior as well as you know from the old men going on

1179
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.190
<v 0>back to the book.
One trouble is that a man's person.
Now this is important.</v>

1180
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:19.480
One trouble is that a man's personality changes in different situations.

1181
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.651
For instance,

1182
01:14:20.651 --> 01:14:25.510
the man who is brave is a lion in the test room at a reception center.

1183
01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:28.690
May Not be so brave when he gets into combat.

1184
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.620
The man who is able to make quick decisions wisely when things are quiet may go

1185
01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:36.260
to pieces when he is distracted by machine gun fire and do something that result

1186
01:14:36.261 --> 01:14:40.870
in his own death or the death of others and difficult situations that may the

1187
01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:42.460
reverse effects on some men.

1188
01:14:42.461 --> 01:14:46.090
Men who have never distinguished themselves in training camp may be come fired

1189
01:14:46.091 --> 01:14:48.610
with new spirit when going,
when the going gets tough,

1190
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:53.170
astounding themselves and other men with what they can do an extreme emergency.

1191
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:57.430
So that's obviously important too.
So even though you know someone,

1192
01:14:57.431 --> 01:15:00.160
you don't even know him,
you don't know what you're going to get.

1193
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:03.460
You might have somebody that freaks out when things go sideways.

1194
01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.540
Next section.
Training makes the soldier.
When men entered the army,

1195
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:15.130
they're told the importance in the fighting areas of taking cover from enemy

1196
01:15:15.131 --> 01:15:19.930
fire in slit trenches.
This point is emphasized in books,
lectures,
training,
films,

1197
01:15:19.931 --> 01:15:23.520
demonstrations and exhibits.
By the time the soldier reaches the battlezone,

1198
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:27.580
he has learned that he should take cover in a slit trench whenever he stops.

1199
01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:30.640
That is one kind of learning.
In one way,

1200
01:15:30.641 --> 01:15:34.900
it is the most useful client with knowledge of how things should be done and why

1201
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:36.130
they are important.

1202
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:40.180
A soldiers equipped to act in new situations and there is nothing that produces

1203
01:15:40.181 --> 01:15:42.130
so many new situations as combat,

1204
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:47.410
but this kind of learning unfortunately does not always result in action.

1205
01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.370
A soldier may know perfectly well that he should dig a trench.

1206
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:55.090
You may have learned it from demonstrations exactly how to go digging it.

1207
01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:59.620
Yet when the enemy planes come overhead,
he may in his excitement,

1208
01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:02.830
forget that what he was learned in such emergencies,

1209
01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:07.240
he is more likely to act from habit.
Then from reasoning and sense,

1210
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.830
habit formation is a further stage of learning.
It depends on practice,

1211
01:16:11.831 --> 01:16:13.390
experience and repetition.

1212
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.580
No action ever becomes automatic by learning in words how to perform it,

1213
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:23.350
but without actually practicing it.
But by repetition,

1214
01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:27.940
the operation of a machine or a rifle gets itself reduced to habit so that it

1215
01:16:27.941 --> 01:16:30.970
becomes almost entirely mechanical like walking.

1216
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.960
You do not have to think about putting your left foot forward after planting

1217
01:16:34.961 --> 01:16:38.800
your right foot ahead.
That is because you have walked so much you could do,

1218
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:42.970
you could not get that way merely from listening to lectures on how to walk.

1219
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:45.430
If during maneuvers,

1220
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:49.810
a soldier practices taking cover instantly whenever he sees or hears an air

1221
01:16:49.811 --> 01:16:52.480
attack warning or plane coming close,
he,

1222
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:54.970
if he always throws himself flat when he first,

1223
01:16:54.971 --> 01:16:58.420
here's the sun whistle of a shell or the singing of bullets past his ears,

1224
01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:01.750
these actions soon becomes second nature to him.

1225
01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:07.300
That particular warning sights and sounds become fixed as signals for immediate

1226
01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:08.860
actions in real emergency.

1227
01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:11.840
The soldier does not have to stop and think about what he should do.

1228
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:16.070
He just does it
straight forward.

1229
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:20.750
That's why we roll in Jujitsu.
That's why egg need.
Look,
drilling is important.

1230
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:25.660
I get it.
You got to learn the move,
but you got to roll.
Yeah.

1231
01:17:25.661 --> 01:17:28.870
Y a n one could argue that drilling it serves the same purpose.

1232
01:17:28.871 --> 01:17:32.380
Just in a more like specific kind of what you gotta do both.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1233
01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.970
Now that if you drill correctly,

1234
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:37.300
but what you can't do is sit there and get shown to move.
Right,
right.

1235
01:17:37.330 --> 01:17:38.650
You got to do the move.
Yeah.

1236
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:42.820
And I used to do that too and we'd have guys going through CQC training and a

1237
01:17:42.821 --> 01:17:44.680
lot of times,
you know,

1238
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:50.200
instructor might want to hear himself talk a lot and explain things cause you

1239
01:17:50.201 --> 01:17:51.940
know,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a pump to the ego.

1240
01:17:51.941 --> 01:17:56.260
When you get up there and you show people what was your,
how I did it,

1241
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.780
did it look,
this is,
you know,

1242
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.880
you get an instructor that wants to hear himself talk and meanwhile they sit

1243
01:18:03.881 --> 01:18:06.350
there and talk for 20 minutes.
Uh,

1244
01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:09.790
the seal platoon could have done three more runs through the kill house in 20

1245
01:18:09.791 --> 01:18:12.850
minutes.
So I'll tell you what,
say what you got to say,

1246
01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.370
say it quick and let the boys go pull that trigger.

1247
01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:20.610
Because that's how we get good by doing back to the book.

1248
01:18:20.741 --> 01:18:25.420
This sort of learning of minor importance in high school or college is basic in

1249
01:18:25.421 --> 01:18:27.450
the army.
That is wide drill is so important.

1250
01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.820
Why discipline is so essential in war games,

1251
01:18:30.821 --> 01:18:33.790
the soldier gets conditioned to all sights and sounds of battle.

1252
01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:34.840
In early training,

1253
01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:38.020
it may be possible to simulate realistically the noises of shells,

1254
01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:42.910
dive bombers and bursting bombs by recordings we produced by loudspeakers in

1255
01:18:42.911 --> 01:18:46.270
advanced training,
a soldier may be taught to lie flat on the ground,

1256
01:18:46.271 --> 01:18:48.490
while real bullets strike within a few feet,

1257
01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.340
close enough to cause San to fall on the back of his neck.

1258
01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.900
He knows he is safe as so long as he lies still,
but if you'd get up and run,

1259
01:18:55.901 --> 01:18:59.560
he will be killed.
That is good training for combat.

1260
01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.210
A real bullet forms,
much better habits than a lecture about a bullet,

1261
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:09.520
such thoroughly drilled habits enabled the soldier to act when there is no time

1262
01:19:09.521 --> 01:19:10.330
for fought.

1263
01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:13.330
They ensure that he will act correctly in mechanically even when his mind is

1264
01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:16.780
confused and thinking is almost impossible

1265
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:23.910
but knowledge of the science of warfare and practicing solving novel military

1266
01:19:23.911 --> 01:19:28.500
problems are important too because they enable the soldier to act wisely in the

1267
01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:32.070
thousands of unexpected emergencies that arise in battle.

1268
01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:37.490
Habit is safer than fought for standardized acts but it won't work for brand new

1269
01:19:38.851 --> 01:19:39.810
problems.

1270
01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:45.420
That is why we would train our guys in brand new problems all the time.

1271
01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:48.840
That way you get a protocol for how to,
how to handle brand new problems.

1272
01:19:49.290 --> 01:19:51.690
You start to understand what you're going to do.
Oh,

1273
01:19:51.691 --> 01:19:53.280
I don't know what's happening.
What do we do a step back.

1274
01:19:53.281 --> 01:19:55.050
I'm going to look around them and assess the situation.

1275
01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.180
I'm going to come up with some possible solutions.

1276
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:59.490
I'm going to think about what the outcomes of those solutions are,

1277
01:19:59.491 --> 01:20:02.040
what the risks are and then it would make a decision we're going to move forward

1278
01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.950
in that direction cause like

1279
01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.010
confronting or dealing

1280
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:12.720
<v 3>with new problems or un charted situations or whatever.</v>

1281
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:17.790
The skill of dealing with that is like another skill in and of itself.

1282
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:21.660
I think you're saying this like last start protocol and people were asking about

1283
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:25.030
protocol protocol for handling new problems.
What do you do?

1284
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:28.000
And eventually you get good at because of the slightly obvious first thing is

1285
01:20:28.001 --> 01:20:30.390
you do is you detach.
You have to take a step back.

1286
01:20:30.391 --> 01:20:34.380
You have to turn around and look around,
physically look around.
So detach,

1287
01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:37.590
look around,
make an assessment,
come up with possible solutions,

1288
01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:41.010
think about what the outcomes of those solutions might be and then pick the one

1289
01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:44.980
that has the best possible outcome.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1290
01:20:44.981 --> 01:20:49.981
And that's pretty different than like trained level 10 training.

1291
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:56.100
Perfect.
Training on situation a,
B,
c,
d,
e,
F,
g,
H,
I,
J,
k,
l,
M,
N,
o.
P.

1292
01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:00.480
And Q.
Because you merged,
you're going to get hit with Z.
Yeah.
When z hits,

1293
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.650
it's like Dang can and then you've totally should.

1294
01:21:02.651 --> 01:21:04.820
I just got a message from a guy that was in,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1295
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:07.530
police officers in a big firefight with some of his guys.

1296
01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.790
And he was literally said,
said,
I was like thinking to myself,
I'll get covered.

1297
01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:14.700
Move.
Here's what we're going to do.
Prioritize and execute.
He's going through.

1298
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.560
He's like,
there was pretty awesome,
pretty awesome to hear that.

1299
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:22.410
To hear a guy say,
Yep,
I can hear your voice saying,
cover,
move,

1300
01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:27.120
put down color of fire right now,
they were not 21 minute firefight,

1301
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:29.610
which is a long day long.
That's a long firefight for,

1302
01:21:29.611 --> 01:21:33.900
especially for police officers.
Back to the book,

1303
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.450
drill for combat changes.

1304
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:41.070
The recruit squad into an efficient fighting machine training can convert an

1305
01:21:41.071 --> 01:21:44.850
unorganized civilian group into an organized unit with deadly power,

1306
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:47.550
military confident competence.
Moreover,

1307
01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:51.690
strips war of its most repulsive and paralyzing horrors

1308
01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:58.200
and knowledge takes from the enemy,
his most potent,
potent,

1309
01:21:58.201 --> 01:22:02.640
and effective.
What?
Weapon?
Surprise,
drill.

1310
01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:03.481
Combat Training,

1311
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:07.530
practice and discipline combined with the experience in war are things that make

1312
01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:10.350
America's combat troops into seasoned troops.

1313
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:14.940
So even taking away the ability for the enemy to surprise you.

1314
01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:16.770
It's like we talked about before.

1315
01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.430
If if you try and move on me in Jujitsu and,

1316
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.270
and I've never seen it before,
there's a chance it's going to work.

1317
01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:27.360
There's the best possible chance go to work and as soon as I know what that move

1318
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:28.194
is,

1319
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.400
I mean it then it's the chances of it working are a lot less,

1320
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:37.380
a lot less.
Significantly less.
Yeah.

1321
01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:40.650
Yeah.
That's why role playing is so important.
Well,

1322
01:22:40.651 --> 01:22:44.250
in the business world is very important because we can come at you with

1323
01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:46.020
different things that a subordinate,

1324
01:22:46.021 --> 01:22:48.360
it's going to save you or even up the chain of command.

1325
01:22:48.361 --> 01:22:51.210
If I had to go brief my boss on something that we were pretty sure he didn't

1326
01:22:51.211 --> 01:22:54.210
like and I was like,
okay,
I go,
you be the boss,

1327
01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.570
you come at me with all the negatives about the plan I've come up with and then

1328
01:22:57.571 --> 01:23:02.070
we do that.
So then when I go in,
I've already seen these even one time.

1329
01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.890
Like I said,
one one time makes an incredible difference.

1330
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1331
01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.230
<v 0>Back to the book and we need speed.</v>

1332
01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.290
Democracy's always have to hurry up at the last minute.

1333
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:16.400
The enemy is always facing us,
ready,
trained,

1334
01:23:16.401 --> 01:23:17.600
and there isn't much time.

1335
01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.470
We must take advantage of every possible shortcut toward the goal of creating

1336
01:23:21.471 --> 01:23:24.800
season troops,
troops armed with adequate,
adequate training.

1337
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:30.320
The first shortcut is an understanding of the few facts about how learning takes

1338
01:23:30.321 --> 01:23:33.830
place.
The most important requirement of learning is incentive.

1339
01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:39.380
Men Marching to drill reluctantly can no more be taught swiftly and efficiently

1340
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:43.280
than a jeep can be taught to run on an empty tank.

1341
01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:49.160
People need incentive,
but fortunately for the army's instructors,

1342
01:23:49.161 --> 01:23:50.430
there is a power.

1343
01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:54.680
There is a powerful motive are furnished by the situation itself.

1344
01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:58.280
No false incentives need be thought up and provided.

1345
01:23:58.460 --> 01:23:59.900
The enemy has attacked us.

1346
01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:04.760
We're at war and no man wants to go out and face the that enemy unprepared.

1347
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.590
No American wants to see American soldiers killed needlessly in unmatched

1348
01:24:09.591 --> 01:24:10.424
battle.

1349
01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:15.080
No one wants to see our armies defeated and the Gestapo policing New York City

1350
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:21.640
success itself is reward to soldier.

1351
01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:24.460
It makes him proud.
This is when they start,

1352
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:27.280
I forgot to say that I'm skipping chunks of this book,

1353
01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:30.970
but this is where he's talking about how the incentives that that uh,

1354
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.110
that a soldier could have.
His commander may commend him,

1355
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:38.620
but it's usually enough if he sees that as CEO has noticed that he has done a

1356
01:24:38.621 --> 01:24:42.040
good job.
Good morale depends on such rewards.

1357
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:51.950
Such awards by his officers and approval from his own comrades in general.

1358
01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:55.860
Reward is much more effective for learning then is punishment.

1359
01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:57.680
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1360
01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.513
<v 0>This is good.</v>

1361
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Punishment excites resentment and tends to make the soldier anxious not to

1362
01:25:04.731 --> 01:25:08.060
comply.
If he can get away with carelessness or disobedience,

1363
01:25:08.210 --> 01:25:12.920
that's if you could remember that right there,
this podcast is worthwhile.

1364
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:14.900
If you remember the fact that as a leader,
if you're,

1365
01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.760
if you're constantly punishing people,

1366
01:25:16.761 --> 01:25:21.761
what you're doing is making them resentful and encouraging them to not comply

1367
01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.800
and rebel against you and try and get away with carelessness and disobedience.

1368
01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.680
Think about your kids do right.

1369
01:25:30.681 --> 01:25:33.780
Cause we do that with the kids better to what I told you.
And then when they try,

1370
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:36.680
they're trying to skate around you.
Yeah.
Reward.

1371
01:25:36.681 --> 01:25:38.990
Keeps his attention on the business in hand.

1372
01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:43.370
Punishment tends to shift his attention from the task to his own troubles.

1373
01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.120
The best kind of reward because it is most effective in learning is the glow of

1374
01:25:47.121 --> 01:25:50.690
satisfaction that a man has when he knows he has done something correctly and

1375
01:25:50.691 --> 01:25:52.190
well it has clicked.

1376
01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:56.750
The most effective punishment is the surge of disgust that comes when he knows

1377
01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:57.950
he's missed the target.

1378
01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.980
<v 2>That's all I've all known is always good</v>

1379
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.450
<v 4>to have a reminder because it's natural to like,</v>

1380
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:11.000
I mean with your kids or whatever the,

1381
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.080
when they do something wrong it's because that'll stick out more in your mind,

1382
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:18.440
you know,
if they do something right,
especially if it's not for the first time,

1383
01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.620
it's like,
oh yeah,
that's how you're supposed to do it.
Right.
Kind of thing.

1384
01:26:21.621 --> 01:26:26.610
So it doesn't stick out in your mind to commend them.
Yeah,
like encouragement,

1385
01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:29.240
reward kind of thing.
Like it's,
you know,
it's more powerful.

1386
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:33.650
But then in your mind as kind of the teacher or whatever the,

1387
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:37.670
when they fail to miss the mark,
you know,
especially if they do it.

1388
01:26:37.671 --> 01:26:40.200
Like if they're having a hard time with something,
you know,
you know,

1389
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:43.490
like to learn stuff,
you got to do it over and then they're having a hard time,

1390
01:26:43.491 --> 01:26:44.930
I don't know,
swimming,
potty,

1391
01:26:44.931 --> 01:26:48.660
train on an or whatever when they don't miss the mark yet.
So you,

1392
01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.290
it comes with the frustration sometimes can't do that,

1393
01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:52.490
can't show that kind of thing.

1394
01:26:52.491 --> 01:26:56.790
But even though it's like the most readily available,
like reaction,
you know the,

1395
01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:01.330
when they fail so you get so yeah,
to be reminded of it helps I think.
Yeah,

1396
01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:02.720
it's an important point.

1397
01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:06.963
<v 2>Next,</v>

1398
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:08.900
<v 0>this is why the army has to,</v>

1399
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.200
has been right to reduce greatly the emphasis on close order drill in recent

1400
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:19.040
years in the light of modern knowledge and in the view of modern conditions of

1401
01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:22.460
warfare.
This drill conflicts of the methods which must be used in battle.

1402
01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:26.360
So closing Bridgette drill is our close order drill is when,
you know,

1403
01:27:26.361 --> 01:27:28.100
you'd see Marines,
army,

1404
01:27:28.101 --> 01:27:31.010
they're like a handy the rifle back road forest and everything's all,

1405
01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.370
it's like parade type stuff.
Yeah.
That's a close order drill is.

1406
01:27:34.371 --> 01:27:36.620
And they used to do more of it and now he's saying that they do less.

1407
01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.950
Back to the book.
In the drill of the early basic training,

1408
01:27:39.951 --> 01:27:44.000
the whole emphasis on teaching is on teaching the soldier to respond to spoken

1409
01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:47.480
commands when he,
yeah,
when he goes into combat,

1410
01:27:47.481 --> 01:27:50.240
smoking spoken commands become impossible.

1411
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:54.680
The human voice is silent in the din of battle.
If commands are given it all,

1412
01:27:54.681 --> 01:27:56.480
they must be given in the form of a nudge,

1413
01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.990
a kick or an arm and hand signal and in drill,

1414
01:27:59.991 --> 01:28:04.100
the soldier also forms the habit of acting shoulder to shoulder with other men.

1415
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.230
He comes to rely on being in a group on doing what the other men do when they do

1416
01:28:09.231 --> 01:28:12.920
it.
Getting combat such close order work would be suicidal.

1417
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:18.290
Men are on their own.
Men are then on their own or in twos or threes.

1418
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:20.510
They must keep at a distance from each other,

1419
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:25.310
both to do much of their fighting skillfully and to avoid making crowded targets

1420
01:28:25.311 --> 01:28:28.340
for the enemies,
bombs,
shells or bullets.

1421
01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:33.230
This means that an advanced trading men must learn new habits which conflict

1422
01:28:33.231 --> 01:28:36.950
some respects of the old.
That's not good.

1423
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.110
The basic rule of learning is this.

1424
01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:44.140
Do it right from the beginning because if you form wrong habits,

1425
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:48.440
you must unlearn them before you can learn what is right.

1426
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:53.740
The rule to follow is never prepare for combat by learning to act on a signal

1427
01:28:53.781 --> 01:28:57.320
that cannot be given after combat has started

1428
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.150
and then it talks about how to increase the speed of training.

1429
01:29:03.151 --> 01:29:06.000
Here's some things to do to increase the speed of training.
Number one,

1430
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:08.460
do things right the first time.
Number two,

1431
01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:12.000
keep constant checks that you know immediately whether you are doing right or

1432
01:29:12.001 --> 01:29:15.840
making a mistake.
That's a good one.
That's why I like shooting steel so much.

1433
01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.840
We were shot steel before.
No,
as soon as you,

1434
01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.500
as soon as you pull the trigger and the shot goes,

1435
01:29:20.501 --> 01:29:24.090
do you know if he hit it or not?
And so it's completely gratifying.

1436
01:29:25.650 --> 01:29:28.530
Make no unnecessary motions.

1437
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.000
If you flourish your hands or putter around with your tools like it or not,

1438
01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:37.140
these profitless motions will become habit to it's want to do everything as

1439
01:29:37.141 --> 01:29:41.580
clean as you can,
do things in the same order and in the same way,

1440
01:29:41.581 --> 01:29:44.460
stick to this rule as far as possible.

1441
01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:50.010
Avoid unnecessary lead links in the chains of your learning.

1442
01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:52.440
This was interesting at,

1443
01:29:52.441 --> 01:29:56.220
well I'm not going to read it cause it went on about learning Morris Code in
how,

1444
01:29:56.610 --> 01:30:01.610
how you can put these multiple different steps in to learn it when in fact you

1445
01:30:01.711 --> 01:30:03.960
could just say that noise means this letter.

1446
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:08.460
You don't have to translate it to the little things in your mind or the sounds

1447
01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:12.300
in your mind.
The dit,
dit dosh.the.dot Dash Dash,

1448
01:30:12.301 --> 01:30:14.460
dash or when you don't need to translate that in your mind.

1449
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:19.550
That sound means this letter and you can get there quickly like a lake.

1450
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:22.640
Lloyd is language.
Really?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1451
01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:25.980
Like when you're fluent in a language you don't think in English anymore.

1452
01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:28.710
I don't.

1453
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:33.710
I've rarely got maybe got into that a little with a few parts of Espaniol when I

1454
01:30:35.341 --> 01:30:36.061
was in college,

1455
01:30:36.061 --> 01:30:40.500
but I never carried on a conversation without translating what I was hearing,

1456
01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:45.400
which is completely lame.
The clunky for sure.

1457
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:50.500
That's part of the process,
I would think.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1458
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:56.070
Number six,
aim at first for smoothness of performance rather than speed.

1459
01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:01.170
Number seven,
be sure to understand what you are trying to do,

1460
01:31:01.171 --> 01:31:05.880
what final objective your aiming aiming at.
That's important.

1461
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:06.890
People should really,

1462
01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.870
you whoever your training needs to understand what they're trying to do.

1463
01:31:09.871 --> 01:31:12.240
I've found this an early Jujitsu.

1464
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:17.190
There was a lot of lacking in this where you didn't understand that getting the

1465
01:31:17.191 --> 01:31:21.340
underhooks was a thing they just understood like for this particular move,

1466
01:31:21.341 --> 01:31:22.290
you put your arm here.

1467
01:31:22.291 --> 01:31:25.380
I didn't understand it was a whole thing would have been better to be like,
hey,

1468
01:31:25.381 --> 01:31:28.140
you're always looking for the underdogs.
Make sense?

1469
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:33.210
That's actually what Dean taught me.
Tony.
He is the one that taught me that too,

1470
01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:38.640
and this is when he was a blue belt.
Number eight,

1471
01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:43.200
learn series of actions rather than single moves.

1472
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:49.110
That's good for Jujitsu as well.
You don't just want to learn the one.

1473
01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.260
You want to learn how all those three,
four,

1474
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:56.040
five moves tied together and how you set up the counters and how the counter

1475
01:31:56.041 --> 01:31:57.330
leads to another trap.

1476
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:03.610
Nine keep on practicing.
10 overlearn.

1477
01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:08.140
Number 11 relax.
Interestingly enough,

1478
01:32:08.650 --> 01:32:11.410
until people to relax and larks hoarder

1479
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:20.680
back to the book ways have been worked out to help cut down the time required to

1480
01:32:20.681 --> 01:32:24.850
master a subject to read and understand a book or assignment to solve a problem

1481
01:32:24.851 --> 01:32:28.720
or to memorize a rule or formula.
The man in the army,
this is,

1482
01:32:28.721 --> 01:32:32.470
this is about studying and I was like,
yeah,

1483
01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:35.950
I don't know if I'm going to put this in there,
but then all you know,
people,

1484
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:38.890
our students,
we will add a new job.

1485
01:32:38.890 --> 01:32:43.780
They got to learn something and this is the most cold blooded way to talk about

1486
01:32:43.781 --> 01:32:47.320
learning.
The man in the army should not allow noise or other distractions or

1487
01:32:47.321 --> 01:32:49.000
interruptions to put them off his work.

1488
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:54.670
Working under such difficult circumstances is direct training for actual

1489
01:32:54.671 --> 01:32:55.451
fighting conditions.
Oh,

1490
01:32:55.451 --> 01:32:58.060
so there's some annoying things going on when you're trying to,
you know,

1491
01:32:58.061 --> 01:33:00.760
read a book.
Cool.
Learn to ignore them

1492
01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:04.870
in the field.
The most in the field,

1493
01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:08.350
the most vital and difficult decisions must be made in the midst of the most

1494
01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:12.190
violent distractions and under all sorts of physical and mental strains.

1495
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:16.960
The officer had to wait until he could be free of noise or disturbance before he

1496
01:33:16.961 --> 01:33:21.400
could work out a problem or make a decision would be useless in the army if he's

1497
01:33:21.401 --> 01:33:22.120
used to it,

1498
01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:25.690
a certain amount of noise and confusion may actually stimulate the army man to

1499
01:33:25.691 --> 01:33:29.590
do better thinking if it's convenient,

1500
01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:32.080
a definite time of the day should be assigned for studying.

1501
01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.440
The mind can be trained to be ready for work in a certain hour,

1502
01:33:34.441 --> 01:33:37.390
so this happens as much the same way as you begin without.

1503
01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:41.650
It'd be and thinking about food or some other set time for the same reason,

1504
01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:45.640
it might be desirable to have a certain place set aside for study,

1505
01:33:45.670 --> 01:33:50.050
even if it is just your bunk in a noisy barracks or tent than the act of sitting

1506
01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:51.310
down in that place.

1507
01:33:51.311 --> 01:33:56.311
Will immediately form habit put you in the proper frame of mind for mental work.

1508
01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:59.740
If you are lucky enough to have a desk or a corner for your study,

1509
01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.700
don't spoil its value by using it for relaxation or nothing,

1510
01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:10.120
but even if they are insistently disturbing,

1511
01:34:10.170 --> 01:34:15.170
it's insistently disturbing is nearly always possible to ignore distractions and

1512
01:34:15.311 --> 01:34:20.260
get down to the business at hand.
The mind is an excellent seed net.

1513
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:23.200
You can read the newspapers and never see the advertisements.

1514
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.400
You would hear a strange footsteps across the room yet never noticed the loud

1515
01:34:27.401 --> 01:34:30.670
ticking of a clock on your own table,
the telegraph,

1516
01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:34.630
or can sleep through the long continuous sounding of his instrument yet wake at

1517
01:34:34.631 --> 01:34:39.631
once his own call when his own call comes in with the right dots and dashes and

1518
01:34:41.531 --> 01:34:45.310
the same way it is possible to make yourself deaf and blind to all sorts of

1519
01:34:45.311 --> 01:34:49.900
sights and sounds except those directly concerned with the problem being
studied.

1520
01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:54.490
Do you get annoyed when there's,
when you're trying to do what?
Do you listen to?

1521
01:34:54.491 --> 01:34:56.890
Music when you're doing work?
Depends on the work,
but yes.

1522
01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.013
<v 1>Interesting.</v>

1523
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:06.220
<v 3>At first it is fatiguing to shut out distractions.
You know what I'm like,</v>

1524
01:35:06.221 --> 01:35:08.620
I was just,
as I was asking her quad,
this is what I'm like,

1525
01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:15.750
if I let something started to bother me,
then it just bothers me a tub and,

1526
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:19.270
and for some reason,
if I just don't let it bother me that it's fine.
Like if my,

1527
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:22.000
my wife's in the other room with,
you know,

1528
01:35:22.001 --> 01:35:25.240
my youngest daughter and they're playing a game and they're making noise and

1529
01:35:25.241 --> 01:35:29.080
having conversations about it and whatever.
If I'm,

1530
01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.830
if I'm in the wrong mindset,
if I don't do what this book is telling me to do,

1531
01:35:32.831 --> 01:35:35.320
which is just,
you just shut it out.
Like I'm like a,

1532
01:35:35.370 --> 01:35:39.550
like a legit do disposed to do.
Oh,
there's some noise over there,
whatever.

1533
01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:45.220
Just lock it up.
Otherwise it's what weakness.
Otherwise it's major weakness.

1534
01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:49.390
What about like snoring?
Um,
like you know,

1535
01:35:49.391 --> 01:35:53.700
your year like a roommate or what?
But you know,
you know,
I have a,

1536
01:35:53.710 --> 01:35:56.080
we have a mutual friend that when we used to go to fights,

1537
01:35:56.081 --> 01:35:59.230
we would stay in one room and the story would be pretty crazy.

1538
01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:03.670
But I would normally sleep right through it.
Yeah.
If I know what's happening.

1539
01:36:03.671 --> 01:36:07.750
It's weird.
Like my,
my crying kids when they were babies,

1540
01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:08.620
they would make a wake up,

1541
01:36:08.621 --> 01:36:11.140
my wife and my wife and I went to sleep right through it.

1542
01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:15.520
But if there's a noise outside the house or whatever,
I'm awake.
And she,

1543
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:20.050
since her throat,
it's like the perfect combination.
The girl,

1544
01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:23.050
the mother and the crying child.
I think that's a genetic thing.

1545
01:36:23.170 --> 01:36:26.230
I think we're like a crying baby.
It's like,
well you know,

1546
01:36:26.290 --> 01:36:29.010
did you get a genetic thing?
Did you learn that in Brookside?

1547
01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:34.000
The halls of Bro Science.
Does that make sense?

1548
01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:37.360
Yes it does.
And is there a part of me,
cause you know when,

1549
01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:41.860
when we had small children,
my wife didn't work.
I did.
So

1550
01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:46.270
that was her roles and respond my roles and responsibility where go to the,

1551
01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:50.410
you know,
do my job during the day.
And whenever I was in the navy,

1552
01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.300
her roles and responsibilities were take care of those kids.
So she,

1553
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:59.590
there's probably a huge part of that where I'm maybe in the beginning when the

1554
01:36:59.591 --> 01:37:01.900
first baby was crying and I was like,
oh,
what's that?

1555
01:37:01.901 --> 01:37:05.230
And then eventually I just said,
oh,
she's got it.
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1556
01:37:05.231 --> 01:37:06.220
Got It handled.

1557
01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:07.173
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.370
<v 3>Uh,
going back to the book,
at first it is fatiguing to shut out distractions.</v>

1559
01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.660
You actually make your muscles tense in your effort to attend a business later

1560
01:37:16.661 --> 01:37:21.090
you get,
so that things that distract you,
no longer worry.
You know,
it's,

1561
01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.210
when I'm on an airplane,

1562
01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:25.510
you're wrapped a screaming baby on an airplane and no factor to me,

1563
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:27.420
it's like no factor whatsoever.

1564
01:37:27.421 --> 01:37:31.240
What about whatever we talked about while we were on there?
Oh,
okay.

1565
01:37:31.241 --> 01:37:33.550
You brought it up too.
I was like,
oh hey that scream you.
Is that,

1566
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:36.340
is that bothering you?
This doesn't bother me at all.

1567
01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.470
Still later they help and find that you miss them if they disappear like the man

1568
01:37:41.471 --> 01:37:44.860
who is startled when his clock stops ticking or the radio.

1569
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:46.450
At first it prevents you from studying,

1570
01:37:46.451 --> 01:37:49.720
but if you keep it on continuously you may get so you cannot study without it.

1571
01:37:50.610 --> 01:37:51.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1572
01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:53.630
<v 3>Having set the stage as well as possible for most effective study.</v>

1573
01:37:53.631 --> 01:37:56.490
The next important preparation is develop absorbing

1574
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:58.290
<v 0>interest in the material to be mastered.</v>

1575
01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:02.790
It is not necessary to resort to self delivered mental pep talks.

1576
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:07.560
Enthusiasm grows naturally out of the realization that a study is important in

1577
01:38:07.561 --> 01:38:11.820
reaching the desirable goal that it will satisfy your curiosity and we'll give

1578
01:38:11.821 --> 01:38:14.280
you a chance to exercise some special talent.

1579
01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:20.810
Isn't that funny how that could very well be a self pep talk that those words

1580
01:38:21.391 --> 01:38:25.050
are a true
true.

1581
01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:31.490
The chief aide to learning however is understanding when something makes sense,

1582
01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.360
when it all fits in with what you already know,

1583
01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:40.860
that it is easily filed away in the ready reference system of your memory where

1584
01:38:40.861 --> 01:38:45.840
it can be recalled later at need.
Learning without understanding is hard.

1585
01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.380
You probably learned the multiplication tables that way.

1586
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:53.100
Learning with understanding may require no effort at all,

1587
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:57.540
so try to understand,
see relationships.

1588
01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:01.200
If chapter eight depends on chapter two then you are uncertain about chapter
two,

1589
01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:06.060
turn back,
see the dependence,
work it out for yourself rather than read it again.

1590
01:39:06.330 --> 01:39:08.400
If you learn a new scientific fact,

1591
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:12.900
see whether you can find instances of it in your own experience and then when

1592
01:39:12.901 --> 01:39:16.050
you think you know it,
when you think you know what you have studied,

1593
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:21.150
say it all over to yourself in your own words that tests understanding.

1594
01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:26.300
Sometimes it gets clear for the first time as you explain it to yourself and if

1595
01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:30.900
you can't get it said to your own satisfaction,

1596
01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:34.890
then chances are you really do not understand it and what you don't understand,

1597
01:39:34.891 --> 01:39:35.760
you won't remember.

1598
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:41.070
That's good information right there for the students of the world which everyone

1599
01:39:41.071 --> 01:39:41.904
should be.

1600
01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:46.920
This is other good information solving problems.

1601
01:39:47.970 --> 01:39:52.970
The method of bird's eye view first applies to rapid problems solving as well.

1602
01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:58.890
Haste to often temps people to plunge into working out the first part of a

1603
01:39:58.891 --> 01:40:01.860
problem where the easy parts before the entire problem is clearly in mind.

1604
01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:05.460
This may result in a false start in needless work.

1605
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.080
Read the whole problem through first use Karen,

1606
01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:10.560
setting the problem down.

1607
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:14.220
If you are new at this particular sort of problem,

1608
01:40:14.221 --> 01:40:16.110
don't try to take shortcuts in this.

1609
01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.610
A little extra time used on formulating the problem in your mind or on paper can

1610
01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:22.800
save a great deal of time in finding the solution.

1611
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:27.000
The next step is to rapidly review all possible methods of solving the problem

1612
01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:30.180
until you find the the one that seems right.
Then try that.

1613
01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:32.220
If that file fails to work,
try another.

1614
01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:34.890
That's the way you work with a mechanical puzzle.

1615
01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.740
You should use the same method on a technical problem.

1616
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:40.770
And this is the same exact thing that I was saying about how to solve like a

1617
01:40:40.771 --> 01:40:45.090
complex tactical scenario.
You'd take a step back.
You look at what the promise,

1618
01:40:45.150 --> 01:40:47.910
you make sure you understand the whole problem.
You just don't say,

1619
01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:48.930
oh we're getting shot out from over there.

1620
01:40:48.931 --> 01:40:51.090
We're gonna change everything and focusing on now cause you're getting flanked

1621
01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:54.280
or you're getting,
you're getting some by fire over there.

1622
01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.580
So you take a step back,
you analyze the situation,

1623
01:40:57.581 --> 01:41:00.880
you make sure you understand it to the best of your possible ability,

1624
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:03.910
and then you start saying,
okay,
what are my options?

1625
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:05.980
Once you figured out what your options are,

1626
01:41:05.981 --> 01:41:09.640
you quickly assess what would the results of those options be?
What's the upside,

1627
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:11.740
what's the downside?
And then you pick one of them.
You go,

1628
01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:17.100
<v 4>that's so funny.
That exact thing.
Not as complex,</v>

1629
01:41:17.101 --> 01:41:20.820
but that exact thing played itself out in my life here recently.

1630
01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.650
So we've got a trampoline,
right?

1631
01:41:22.651 --> 01:41:25.920
You don't want those big ones for your kids and you've got to put it together.

1632
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:28.860
It didn't look at the whole instructions.
Well,

1633
01:41:28.861 --> 01:41:32.100
I do this thing where it was that that they said,
I forget how they call it,

1634
01:41:32.101 --> 01:41:35.040
said the words that they use in the book right there that you just said,

1635
01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:38.250
but basically I looked at it.
I didn't understand the whole thing.

1636
01:41:38.251 --> 01:41:40.790
I didn't read the whole answer.
I don't know.
I looked at it,
I was like,
all right,

1637
01:41:40.791 --> 01:41:43.980
I understand.
I see.
I see the problem I'm dealing with here.
So I did it.

1638
01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.450
And how'd that work out for it,
Bro?
Three separate times I went,

1639
01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.880
you know how like at a certain point you got to make sure you've got to do

1640
01:41:50.881 --> 01:41:52.160
something.
It's like that kind of,

1641
01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:57.060
so I had to make sure that the springs were aligned in a certain way for a

1642
01:41:57.061 --> 01:42:00.510
reason that's going to come up later that she didn't know.
So I'm like,
sure,

1643
01:42:00.511 --> 01:42:04.770
I get it.
I'm smart.
I've put on all this through the whole thing.

1644
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:08.400
Everything took like an hour,
just over an hour to do it.

1645
01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:12.420
So I keep going and keep going.
Keep going.
Now it's time to put up like the,
uh,

1646
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:16.260
the,
you know,
the little barriers that your kids don't fly off their trampoline,

1647
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:20.340
but the springs,
the springs are not aligned with the hooks there,

1648
01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.560
so I can't put up the barriers.
Yeah,
it's a bummer,
isn't it?

1649
01:42:22.590 --> 01:42:26.340
It's a freaking bummer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it happened again with another thing later.

1650
01:42:26.341 --> 01:42:27.540
Actually it happened four times,

1651
01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:31.020
but the fourth thing was just the little basketball hoop and I was like,

1652
01:42:31.021 --> 01:42:34.860
it's not worth it.
I never put it on the basketball hoop but haven't,
hey,

1653
01:42:35.010 --> 01:42:36.660
a fire were to under it to read the whole thing,

1654
01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:39.270
read the whole Dang thing and I wouldn't have written,

1655
01:42:39.271 --> 01:42:40.800
it would've saved me like three hours

1656
01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:45.480
<v 0>back to the book when you're stumped and maybe because you have taken the wrong</v>

1657
01:42:45.481 --> 01:42:46.470
approach to the promise,

1658
01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:50.880
easy to get into a Rut in thinking it is hard to shake yourself loose from one

1659
01:42:50.881 --> 01:42:52.890
point of view and see a completely new it.

1660
01:42:53.190 --> 01:42:56.330
This stuff is so simply stated that it's a,

1661
01:42:56.331 --> 01:42:59.520
you underestimate the power of what's being said right here.
Yeah.

1662
01:42:59.670 --> 01:43:02.160
This stuff is lifesavers.

1663
01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.930
You tend to keep going back and repeating this same old kind of attack that is

1664
01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:10.860
always it failed.
It's like feeling in the same,

1665
01:43:10.890 --> 01:43:13.870
it's like it's like feeling in the same pocket six times,

1666
01:43:14.370 --> 01:43:17.130
six times when you've lost your cigarettes and cannot find them.

1667
01:43:19.290 --> 01:43:20.250
Especially.

1668
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:25.310
Is it hard to try new methods when you are tired or nervous over your failure to

1669
01:43:25.711 --> 01:43:26.970
get the right answer?

1670
01:43:27.330 --> 01:43:31.020
At such times it is best to close your book and work on something else or to do

1671
01:43:31.021 --> 01:43:35.100
something outdoors with fresh air or even if you can afford the time,

1672
01:43:35.101 --> 01:43:37.810
take a nap when you come back to your problem and the,

1673
01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:41.670
the new approach may come to you in a flash and from then on,

1674
01:43:41.671 --> 01:43:43.680
the work may go quickly and smoothly.

1675
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.903
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1676
01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:48.520
<v 0>I,
I have to actually,</v>

1677
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:53.530
that's one of those things I'm pretty instinctive on a lot things that I do in

1678
01:43:53.931 --> 01:43:57.710
terms of things that I talk about in the way I actually apply them in my life,

1679
01:43:58.070 --> 01:44:00.830
I'm pretty good at most of them.
Most of them a hug.
I'm not even,

1680
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:03.890
I don't have to consciously,
I can kind of look back and go,
oh,

1681
01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:08.210
he asked me what I did and I'm pretty stoked on it.
I can do that,

1682
01:44:08.211 --> 01:44:10.700
especially in Jujitsu.
I can get in a Rut

1683
01:44:10.750 --> 01:44:11.311
<v 3>and be like,
oh,</v>

1684
01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:13.530
I'm just going to do this right here and it should work because I've done it

1685
01:44:13.531 --> 01:44:17.250
before and it's going to work this time and I'll have to constantly be like,

1686
01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.680
oh you,
you're,
you're,
you're beating your head against the wall.

1687
01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:22.290
You don't do it anymore.
And I'll have to do a different approach.

1688
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:28.330
But I mean it's kind of demonstrates your humility because you've always like

1689
01:44:29.041 --> 01:44:32.130
every time we roll in and actually when I see you rolling with other like really

1690
01:44:32.131 --> 01:44:32.790
good guys,

1691
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:37.790
it seems like you adapt and make little changes way quicker than most people in

1692
01:44:38.131 --> 01:44:41.340
for Dang.
Sure.
Way quicker than me.
I feel like I'm all that,

1693
01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:42.300
like what you just said,

1694
01:44:42.330 --> 01:44:45.770
I feel like that's just a hundred percent know what I'm saying.

1695
01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:49.860
But I'm sure I'm okay at it.
I mean,
I know I'm okay at it,

1696
01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:53.760
but even me at this point I'll be like,
oh,

1697
01:44:53.970 --> 01:44:55.620
he's not going to put his arm there.

1698
01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.390
You've tried it three times in a row working.
You need to do something else.
Yeah.

1699
01:45:00.391 --> 01:45:01.580
You can like recognize,

1700
01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.850
I recognize when I'm beating my head up against the wall and that's not a good

1701
01:45:05.851 --> 01:45:06.684
feeling

1702
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:09.590
<v 0>and it's both.
The great feeling is as soon as you do something different,</v>

1703
01:45:09.591 --> 01:45:10.460
generally you,

1704
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:14.270
you may not get total success but you won't get the same outcome because the

1705
01:45:14.271 --> 01:45:16.580
outcome was failing,
which we don't like know

1706
01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.540
how to make learning stick.

1707
01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:24.020
The two basic principles of learning anything,

1708
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:29.090
our interest and participation,
it is not true.

1709
01:45:29.091 --> 01:45:32.300
That repetition alone is the basis of learning something.
Well,

1710
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:37.340
a man who repeats an act again and again with his mind only half of what he is

1711
01:45:37.341 --> 01:45:41.480
due.
It was mind only half on what he's doing.
May indeed learn it,

1712
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:45.170
but he will learn it neither quickly nor well.

1713
01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:50.200
Fortunately doing a thing and practicing it usually reinforce a man's interest

1714
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:56.590
so that there is really only one important principle interest at the bottom of

1715
01:45:56.601 --> 01:46:00.530
learning.
Active participation is secured by practice.

1716
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:05.590
Lectures are used only when preliminary explanation at some length is needed or

1717
01:46:06.801 --> 01:46:09.260
when men cannot be put through the work itself.

1718
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:12.830
You're not only told how to fire a rifle,

1719
01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:17.720
you or helped actually to do the firing and you work out of doors in the way

1720
01:46:17.721 --> 01:46:19.400
that you will later work in combat.

1721
01:46:19.730 --> 01:46:24.730
You do under instruction what later on you are going to have to do in combat

1722
01:46:25.161 --> 01:46:28.250
yourself.
So you've got to do these things.

1723
01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:33.770
Interest is secured in a variety of way,
number of a variety of ways.
Number one,

1724
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:38.660
the personality of the instructor is important.
It should be dynamic and fort.

1725
01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:42.920
It should be a dynamic enforceful person who appreciates the fact that learning

1726
01:46:42.921 --> 01:46:45.860
takes time and that some men are slower than others.

1727
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:50.890
He must stimulate his men to want to learn to instruction must finally become

1728
01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:52.950
individual.

1729
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:56.940
There must be close contact between some instructor in every soldier.

1730
01:46:58.840 --> 01:46:59.180
Three,

1731
01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:04.180
the relation of the learning to the problems of combat must always be stressed

1732
01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:10.060
for,
although nonessentials are an omitted in army teaching,

1733
01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:14.860
it is important that the soldier should understand the basic principles of what

1734
01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:15.694
he is doing.

1735
01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:20.880
If he is learning how to use a machine that he should know how the machine

1736
01:47:20.891 --> 01:47:21.724
works.

1737
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:25.143
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1738
01:47:25.630 --> 01:47:28.900
<v 0>critical.
And number five,</v>

1739
01:47:29.230 --> 01:47:34.230
the soldier must also have full knowledge of the purpose of what he learns of

1740
01:47:34.571 --> 01:47:36.130
why he needs to know it.

1741
01:47:36.730 --> 01:47:41.730
Only with such knowledge can his interest be at the highest and only with such

1742
01:47:42.101 --> 01:47:46.900
knowledge is he able to adapt what he has learned to different circumstances

1743
01:47:46.901 --> 01:47:49.360
that arise in combat.
So we've got to know why.

1744
01:47:53.290 --> 01:47:58.290
It also says here that all army commanders are leaders and teachers.

1745
01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.510
So if you're a leader,

1746
01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:05.640
you are a teacher.

1747
01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.630
Talking a little bit here about efficiency and trading,

1748
01:48:10.631 --> 01:48:14.380
the simplest kind of learning is to learn by trial and error.

1749
01:48:14.410 --> 01:48:18.550
But this isn't the best,
the most efficient way.
It wastes too much time.

1750
01:48:18.551 --> 01:48:22.930
And so the army never uses it except in solving original problems where one

1751
01:48:22.931 --> 01:48:26.980
method after another may be tried or at least imagined.

1752
01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.090
So trial and error is never the best.
Here's a good one.
In battle,

1753
01:48:32.091 --> 01:48:36.890
a leader can give orders,
but only brief ones.
Sometimes by signal.

1754
01:48:36.891 --> 01:48:39.890
The soldier receiving such an order must also,

1755
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:41.090
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1756
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:46.090
<v 0>see the battle situation right around him in deciding how to best carry out that</v>

1757
01:48:47.301 --> 01:48:48.134
order.

1758
01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:55.410
Next,
how to speed up training.

1759
01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:57.230
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1760
01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.250
<v 0>we'll to learn.</v>

1761
01:48:59.130 --> 01:48:59.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1762
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:00.111
<v 0>Uh,
soldiers.</v>

1763
01:49:00.111 --> 01:49:03.500
Common Sense tells him that he must learn how to fight before he meets the
enemy.

1764
01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:04.940
Number two,
interest.

1765
01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:06.270
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:07.890
<v 0>Number three,
disciplined.</v>

1767
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:09.320
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.220
<v 0>Soldiers are trained to realize the serious importance of the things they are</v>

1769
01:49:13.221 --> 01:49:17.090
taught.
How much these things we'll meet in combat later on.

1770
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:23.720
Number four,
individual instruction.
Number five,

1771
01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:26.090
experience of success.

1772
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:31.220
Army instructors try their best to see that each man does a thing right the

1773
01:49:31.221 --> 01:49:36.221
first time even by holding his hand and putting it through the correct movements

1774
01:49:36.471 --> 01:49:40.750
if necessary.
Number six,

1775
01:49:40.751 --> 01:49:42.550
elimination of nonessentials.

1776
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:46.630
You only supposed to be learning things that you actually need to know.

1777
01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:51.600
Number seven,
all around attack every possible way of reaching the soldiers.

1778
01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:54.580
Student mind is utilized.

1779
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:49:55.950 --> 01:50:00.300
<v 0>And then this instruction is immediately put to use in action on the drop.</v>

1781
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:03.630
Soldiers learn by doing so as far as possible.
Instruction is capped.

1782
01:50:03.631 --> 01:50:05.460
Practical and concrete.

1783
01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:09.930
If it instructor puts too much emphasis on training men in the particular

1784
01:50:09.931 --> 01:50:11.490
details of doing a job,

1785
01:50:11.491 --> 01:50:14.970
the soldier fails to get a clear understanding of the result aimed at it.

1786
01:50:16.650 --> 01:50:18.090
Although men and training,

1787
01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:22.860
although in training men in many different army jobs,

1788
01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.670
adequate attention must be paid to the detailed steps to be taken to reach the

1789
01:50:26.671 --> 01:50:27.570
final objective.

1790
01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:32.840
The aim itself must also be made entirely clear to the soldier.

1791
01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:36.150
This is cool.
And I trained a little kids in Jujitsu and be like,

1792
01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:39.270
you just got to get around their legs.
Yeah.
Did you tell them that?

1793
01:50:39.271 --> 01:50:43.230
And they'll figure it out,
how to do it and then when they get stumped,

1794
01:50:43.231 --> 01:50:45.090
you teach them some actual technique.

1795
01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:50.280
Otherwise he's apt to become confused in battle if the situation changes and he

1796
01:50:50.281 --> 01:50:54.310
cannot follow the steps in exactly the way he was taught in training

1797
01:50:59.490 --> 01:51:01.320
efficiency in the army,

1798
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:06.090
every ounce of the soldiers energy should be concentrated on the defeat of the

1799
01:51:06.091 --> 01:51:11.091
enemy whenever he wastes his strength on any sort of activity that does not

1800
01:51:11.411 --> 01:51:15.700
contribute to that one,
and it is an effect.
A casualty.

1801
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:21.960
No.
Where is efficiency more important than in combat there?

1802
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:25.560
Every man must work at the very peak of his powers.

1803
01:51:25.710 --> 01:51:30.360
His eyes must see better than the enemy's eyes.
His ears must hear better.

1804
01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:34.860
He must think better on this victory.
Depends.

1805
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:41.990
We re weariness tired hands or eyes or nervous system.

1806
01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.790
Anything that reduces the soldiers efficiency at a critical moment in combat may

1807
01:51:47.791 --> 01:51:49.080
cost him his life.

1808
01:51:49.590 --> 01:51:53.940
It may cost the army apposition and advance a battle.

1809
01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:55.953
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1810
01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:00.380
<v 0>The enemy usually refuses to recognize the end of a work day.</v>

1811
01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:01.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1812
01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:06.360
<v 0>Nature often provides the only lighting bomb holes.
Ensure ventilation.</v>

1813
01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:08.850
When a soldier gets an actual combat,

1814
01:52:08.851 --> 01:52:13.830
what he is called upon to do seems to have no similarity at all to anything he

1815
01:52:13.831 --> 01:52:17.130
had ever done in a civilian job.
There is no routine in battle,

1816
01:52:17.250 --> 01:52:20.370
no standardization,
no monotonous repetition.

1817
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:24.450
Each moment is a challenging new experience calling for new decisions and fresh

1818
01:52:24.451 --> 01:52:25.230
insight.

1819
01:52:25.230 --> 01:52:30.210
It is hard to see where the combat soldier can get any help at all from what

1820
01:52:30.211 --> 01:52:34.200
he's learned about efficiency in a factory far from the battlezone.

1821
01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:40.980
That is why a soldier in training must learn from the start to cut out useless

1822
01:52:40.981 --> 01:52:45.350
and roundabout movements that take needless time,
seconds count

1823
01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:49.490
and a soldier's energy counts too.

1824
01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:53.330
He can't afford to get worn down before his job is done.

1825
01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:58.080
He must keep his speed and accuracy up to top notch performance and he

1826
01:52:58.081 --> 01:53:03.080
blundering combat may be fatal there.
He may not be able to miss an AME again.

1827
01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:06.380
He may never have another chance.

1828
01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:12.400
No,
we get into this last little section that we're going to cover today.

1829
01:53:12.401 --> 01:53:15.130
It's about fatigue,
sleep,

1830
01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:18.880
that other enemy

1831
01:53:20.590 --> 01:53:25.590
fatigue is a fifth column enemy that is always ready to infiltrate and attack.

1832
01:53:26.651 --> 01:53:30.310
No Man can stick at a job for long periods through the day and night and

1833
01:53:30.311 --> 01:53:31.960
continue at top notch performance,

1834
01:53:31.961 --> 01:53:35.290
especially if his job involves using a great deal of strength,

1835
01:53:35.291 --> 01:53:38.590
keeping alert and making accurate split second decisions.

1836
01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.000
So you're allegedly need rest.

1837
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:49.070
I posted the other day,
sleep is the enemy and people get,

1838
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:53.610
so it's a song by Danko Jones and it's a great song.
Sure.

1839
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:57.350
But,
and you know,
I kind of do feel that way,
you know,

1840
01:53:57.351 --> 01:54:01.460
cause it's pretty easy just to fold to sleep and you could spend all day in bed.

1841
01:54:01.461 --> 01:54:05.720
I know you don't see it that way,
but I kind of knew.
But sleep is the enemy.

1842
01:54:05.721 --> 01:54:09.630
Dislike food is the enemy.
Yeah.
Abusing.
It

1843
01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:17.640
could point just how long men can work and continue to do their best.

1844
01:54:19.011 --> 01:54:23.720
Depends upon a great many different things.
It depends first upon the man.

1845
01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:26.060
It depends also on the type of work.

1846
01:54:26.061 --> 01:54:28.430
It depends upon the conditions of the work upon the food,

1847
01:54:28.431 --> 01:54:33.431
eating upon rest obtained during the job upon worry and excitement and finally

1848
01:54:33.651 --> 01:54:35.420
upon the necessity for action,

1849
01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:40.460
a man can run fast and long if death or the devil is behind him,

1850
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:46.750
he can fight hard for unbelievable lengths of time if there can be no retreat or

1851
01:54:47.181 --> 01:54:48.890
a victory is in sight.

1852
01:54:50.210 --> 01:54:54.110
Most hazardous is the fatigue which comes from spurts of extreme effort,

1853
01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:56.510
the greatest of which a man is capable.

1854
01:54:56.511 --> 01:55:01.160
Such supreme effort seldom if ever occurs in any job on the home front.

1855
01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:03.860
It does occur in sport.

1856
01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:08.980
It does occur in battle spurred by the necessity necessity to extraordinary

1857
01:55:09.441 --> 01:55:09.951
violence.

1858
01:55:09.951 --> 01:55:14.951
A man may actually put out so much effort that he burns up his body fuel at a

1859
01:55:15.081 --> 01:55:18.110
rate eight times more than the normal rate.

1860
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:23.330
I have no idea where they got these numbers eight times more.

1861
01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:25.010
That's a pretty accurate,
this,

1862
01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:29.090
he cannot keep up more than a few minutes at a time.

1863
01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:32.210
Otherwise the sugar in his blood will fail.

1864
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:35.570
We'll fall to a critically low level.
His heart will fail,

1865
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:38.390
is collapse or even death will follow.

1866
01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:42.100
What do you think bro?
Science right there.
Well,

1867
01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:44.010
I mean then you make a good point where you,

1868
01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:48.130
<v 4>where he got these,
I dunno where he got those numbers from.</v>

1869
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:51.300
People get Rhabdo yes.
And,
and,

1870
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:56.080
but you get rhabdo you don't like fail on the moment.
Your heart doesn't fail.

1871
01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:56.320
Yeah.

1872
01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:01.320
Well the first thing I thought of is like in Jujitsu or MMA where you get to

1873
01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:05.250
like be adrenaline dump,
right?
Because your,
your soul like,

1874
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:10.140
I mean it's through Adrenalin button.
Like it's these external circumstances.

1875
01:56:10.141 --> 01:56:13.080
It's like you're on the stage,
you know,
usually it's an inner competition.

1876
01:56:13.081 --> 01:56:15.870
It's not necessarily training.
So you're on the stage,

1877
01:56:15.871 --> 01:56:20.580
so it's when it's do or die,
do or die.
It's not,

1878
01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:24.110
but that's what you guys are.
Yes.
But,

1879
01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.460
so I was just thinking like if this is true,

1880
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:31.080
like when a guy gets gassed in the UFC and he just can't go on.

1881
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.010
But then what if somebody came in there with a machete and was like,

1882
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:40.060
run a hack you to pieces.
What do you think the guy would do?
He'd run.
Yeah,

1883
01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:45.140
but that's like another level of stress that's do or die do or die out there on

1884
01:56:45.871 --> 01:56:50.520
the UFC or whatever.
And that's not accurate.
It's very inaccurate.

1885
01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:55.200
But as an example,
it feels like that's,
you know,
like they're still,

1886
01:56:55.201 --> 01:56:58.350
but they're using like probably eight times the energy,
you know,

1887
01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:01.290
cause there's so pumped up because of their onstage and stuff,

1888
01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:04.670
the nerves and all that stuff.
So it's like that,
you know,

1889
01:57:04.671 --> 01:57:07.590
it's another weird one when someone gases or whatever and then they ended up

1890
01:57:07.591 --> 01:57:12.591
winning and then they get that other surge [inaudible] a couple of 10 seconds

1891
01:57:14.071 --> 01:57:17.830
ago.
Why don't you put that effort out Bro.
Yeah.
So that,

1892
01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:21.450
that proves,
I wrote about this in the field manual.
Like,

1893
01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:24.160
sometimes you gotta use emotion and sometimes you've got to use logic because

1894
01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:27.490
someone's going to let that emotion come out yet.
So,
but all that,

1895
01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:30.360
the thing is like,
that does sound funny and look funny.

1896
01:57:30.361 --> 01:57:34.290
If a guy likes seems to be sort of gas and then write the literally the second

1897
01:57:34.291 --> 01:57:37.520
he wins,
he's,
he's running with his hand in there when you know,

1898
01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:40.890
but all that is,
that's not like a,
um,

1899
01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:45.600
like a maybe a slacker Thurston,
nothing like that.
That's like just the stress.

1900
01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:49.170
And winning is like,
I don't know if I'd call it a stress,

1901
01:57:49.171 --> 01:57:52.170
but I guess this is what I heard.
This is bro Science,
I heard this from people,

1902
01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.970
I need this in any official thing,

1903
01:57:53.971 --> 01:57:57.600
but you get like this boost of like hormones,

1904
01:57:57.601 --> 01:58:01.110
like testosterone and all these crazy hormones when you win a fight.

1905
01:58:01.710 --> 01:58:05.310
So it's maybe to that.
So it's like,
man,
it's not like it's controllable.

1906
01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:06.720
You'd have to actually be,

1907
01:58:06.810 --> 01:58:11.280
be confronted with a stimulus of winning for that tree to get that boost.

1908
01:58:11.281 --> 01:58:11.790
You know,

1909
01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:16.790
just like you're confronted with a stimulus of the crowd to get that overdrive

1910
01:58:16.921 --> 01:58:19.350
scenario where using eight times the energy

1911
01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:23.910
back to the book yet such fatigue,

1912
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.290
fatigue does not always make you inefficient if you have strong enough need or

1913
01:58:28.291 --> 01:58:31.770
desire for action.
I like that right there.
Yeah.

1914
01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:34.110
That's that machete scenario that you just introduced.

1915
01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:38.700
Sometimes I wonder if I'm like perpetually in a state of like war.

1916
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:42.010
I wonder that my brain too,
because sometimes I can't

1917
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.430
<v 3>sleep at all.
I believe that.
Yeah.
And I,</v>

1918
01:58:46.930 --> 01:58:47.800
because I want to get up.

1919
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.430
I'm not like that all the time.
I mean I do.
There's,

1920
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:56.390
there's definitely days where I sleep really soundly.
Yeah.

1921
01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:58.330
But a lot of times it's like,
no,

1922
01:58:58.331 --> 01:59:02.590
it's not happening cause I got stuff I got to do word what a war over here on my

1923
01:59:02.591 --> 01:59:04.510
end over here,
I understand.
Yes.

1924
01:59:05.410 --> 01:59:08.710
Mental work and emotional strain or also fatiguing,

1925
01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:12.090
but the man who gets tired from mental work where the strain of responsibility

1926
01:59:12.091 --> 01:59:13.630
and worry has additional problem.

1927
01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:18.940
He may not consume the sugar in his blood as does the man engaged in a violent

1928
01:59:18.941 --> 01:59:20.620
physical worker.
Combat his blood,

1929
01:59:20.621 --> 01:59:25.120
therefore gets out of balance as bro Science coming covenants and the rest of

1930
01:59:25.121 --> 01:59:28.150
sleep may not readily restored.
It's actually weird because it's both sides,

1931
01:59:28.151 --> 01:59:31.120
but it makes sense.
Yeah.
I guess all bro Science kind of makes sense.

1932
01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.190
That's why it's Bro Science,
right?

1933
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:36.790
It is good for the man who's been under this sort of strain to get some sort of

1934
01:59:36.791 --> 01:59:39.610
physical exercise.
A swift game of tennis,

1935
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:42.910
a long walk or a turn at shopping would.

1936
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:49.510
A second effect of fatigue is the tired feeling.
I think that's funny.

1937
01:59:50.590 --> 01:59:55.210
This is nature's natural protection against over fatigue.

1938
01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:56.410
When a man feels tired,

1939
01:59:56.411 --> 02:00:00.220
it becomes increasingly difficult for him to go on with his job.

1940
02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:04.660
He is more and more eager for rest and sleep.

1941
02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:08.950
Less and less able to spur himself on to go another mile.

1942
02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:13.150
The best antidote for this feeling of tiredness is high morale and the example

1943
02:00:13.151 --> 02:00:14.020
of other men.

1944
02:00:14.530 --> 02:00:19.270
It is the man working alone who has the hardest job in combating his own desire

1945
02:00:19.271 --> 02:00:20.470
to lie down and sleep,

1946
02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:25.570
but the most important effect of fatigue is the effect it has on work.

1947
02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:29.980
When a man is tired,
he doesn't,
he cannot do his very best.

1948
02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.240
The amount of work he is able to do falls off and the quality of his work

1949
02:00:34.241 --> 02:00:37.870
suffers too.
He does not see it as well,

1950
02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:41.740
does not hear as well,
nor is he so alert.

1951
02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:46.920
His movements may become clumsy and bungling in loss of loss and efficiency.

1952
02:00:46.991 --> 02:00:50.860
Strange as it may seem,
is not always related to feelings of fatigue.

1953
02:00:51.190 --> 02:00:54.940
A man may feel very tired when he has not been working particularly hard,

1954
02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:59.110
but is merely board or untrusted an interested in his work or when the

1955
02:00:59.111 --> 02:01:02.680
ventilation is so bad that he gets dopey.
This is important.

1956
02:01:02.681 --> 02:01:04.330
I think on the other hand,

1957
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:09.390
a man really close to exhaustion may be so excited by his work that he's unable

1958
02:01:10.481 --> 02:01:12.890
to rest and does not feel tired at all.
Oh yeah,

1959
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.080
so consider this and probably think about testimony for some reason.
Yeah,
it is.

1960
02:01:17.650 --> 02:01:22.330
That's what I think.
And consider this like in Jujitsu,
right?
Or like right now,

1961
02:01:22.331 --> 02:01:26.380
if I were to talk enough smack to you right now,
like no matter how you feel,

1962
02:01:26.381 --> 02:01:28.210
you can be tired,
you can be a one hour sleep,

1963
02:01:28.211 --> 02:01:31.150
you can be doing all this stuff like before and whenever you can be terrified

1964
02:01:31.170 --> 02:01:33.700
talking enough smack and I challenge you to roll outside.

1965
02:01:33.701 --> 02:01:37.630
You'll probably do it there.
There's no problem it's on.

1966
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.080
But if I say okay,

1967
02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:43.560
<v 4>after this go like run on a treadmill,
it's easier.</v>

1968
02:01:43.561 --> 02:01:45.150
It's easier output

1969
02:01:56.100 --> 02:02:01.020
anyway.
Debatably easier to run on a treadmill.

1970
02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:05.820
But man,
you ever ran a day?
You used,
have you ever run on Treadmill,
treadmill?

1971
02:02:05.821 --> 02:02:08.790
Probably 10 times in my whole life.
And you know,

1972
02:02:08.791 --> 02:02:11.700
I used to get into the trip moan,
but man,
if when you,

1973
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:13.650
when that boredom hits you probably you're like,

1974
02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:15.780
I can't run one more step on this damn thing.

1975
02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.500
Even though I could easily go train right now with like a bunch of good guys,

1976
02:02:19.501 --> 02:02:22.500
you know?
So it's like,
it's that exact thing when you get bored.

1977
02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:26.490
Like just the littlest bit of fatigue is going to jam you up big time,

1978
02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.020
but even if you're really fatigued and you're doing something fun,
you'll go,

1979
02:02:31.450 --> 02:02:35.260
<v 0>oh yeah for sure.
That's why Jujitsu such good exercise cause it's fun.</v>

1980
02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:40.210
So true men differ considerably in the rate at which they get tired on the same

1981
02:02:40.211 --> 02:02:44.290
job.
They differ even more in their rates of recovery after work is over.

1982
02:02:44.291 --> 02:02:47.890
There is almost no general rule as to what will happen except that recovery is

1983
02:02:47.891 --> 02:02:51.160
very rapid at first and slows down as the rest of the state is approached.

1984
02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:53.230
In fact means however,

1985
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:58.300
that a lot of good can be got out of short rest and that many short rests are

1986
02:02:58.301 --> 02:03:01.960
better than one long one.
That makes sense to me.
Taking a little power nap,

1987
02:03:03.370 --> 02:03:06.730
students learn best if they did not do all learning at once.

1988
02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.980
Do not try and cram up before examinations,

1989
02:03:08.981 --> 02:03:12.160
but study a little and then quit for a while for a day or two.

1990
02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:16.840
In industry efficiency is highest when rest pauses are ranged at frequent

1991
02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:19.930
intervals.
I agree with that.

1992
02:03:20.170 --> 02:03:22.180
Although some I just power through stuff

1993
02:03:23.710 --> 02:03:27.160
so it does not pay to overwork workers or soldiers.

1994
02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:32.170
Some fatigue is on avoidable and much fatigue must be undergone in the process

1995
02:03:32.171 --> 02:03:33.430
of toughening a soldier,

1996
02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:37.810
but chronic fatigue is not to be found along the shortest road to victory.

1997
02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:42.220
So don't get tired.
Now it gets real specific on sleep.

1998
02:03:42.970 --> 02:03:45.190
You can stay up all night and keep awake.
And this,

1999
02:03:45.250 --> 02:03:48.620
I was surprised how accurate this reflects me.
Hmm.

2000
02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:51.520
I think you'll find it accurate as well.

2001
02:03:51.670 --> 02:03:55.510
You can stay up all night and keep awake.
Provided you are active,

2002
02:03:55.570 --> 02:03:59.470
provided you keep using some muscles,
at least the speaking muscles.

2003
02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:03.940
You can march all night,
play poker all night,
fight all night and talk all night.

2004
02:04:04.450 --> 02:04:05.320
You will likely,

2005
02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:11.010
you will be likely to get terribly sleepy somewhere between zero 300 and zero

2006
02:04:11.111 --> 02:04:15.610
600 unless you were doing something exciting or intensely interesting.

2007
02:04:16.210 --> 02:04:18.190
But you can get through that,
provided your active.

2008
02:04:18.191 --> 02:04:19.390
So like this would happen a lot.

2009
02:04:19.391 --> 02:04:24.391
You got on a patrol and you patrol all night to get to a position and then it's

2010
02:04:24.911 --> 02:04:28.330
now three o'clock in the morning and that's when you get tired.

2011
02:04:28.331 --> 02:04:31.300
Four o'clock in the morning you haven't gone to at and that's when you get
tired.

2012
02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:36.280
Then this happens,
um,
of do actually continue on.
That does not mean however,

2013
02:04:36.281 --> 02:04:40.110
that you can read study all night using few muscles other than those of your

2014
02:04:40.111 --> 02:04:41.730
eyes.
If you have to study all night,

2015
02:04:41.731 --> 02:04:46.620
you may need to read out loud or stand up to read
by the time.

2016
02:04:46.621 --> 02:04:49.110
Cause basically,
and that's totally true,
right?

2017
02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:53.140
If you have work to do and you're up working,
it's fine.
But if you,

2018
02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:57.660
if you going to read this book in the next 10 hours and you're falling asleep,

2019
02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:00.600
and that's one of the reasons why if you like,

2020
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:02.760
let's say of a normal schedule job,

2021
02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:06.360
like a nine to five and then you want to work out or good Jujitsu or something

2022
02:05:06.361 --> 02:05:07.020
after work,

2023
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:11.340
don't go home because when you go home to shut down on the couch for a second or

2024
02:05:11.341 --> 02:05:16.080
even if you just like,
you know,
just talk to your wife or whatever,
it's like

2025
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:21.050
rather than going straight to the gym and you're,
you're,

2026
02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:24.070
that might be the best advice you've ever given.
Seriously.

2027
02:05:25.330 --> 02:05:29.250
Like if you want to train,
don't go home,
go to the gym.

2028
02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:33.000
That's very good advice.
Then it goes on in.

2029
02:05:33.001 --> 02:05:36.150
It says by breakfast time you'll be getting less sleepy.
This is totally true.

2030
02:05:36.151 --> 02:05:38.100
If you stay up and then once the sun coming up,

2031
02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:40.920
you can get through the next day pretty well.
You may feel tired,

2032
02:05:40.921 --> 02:05:43.440
especially you've been awake march every especially you've been marching or

2033
02:05:43.441 --> 02:05:47.610
walking to keep awake.
You won't feel fresh.
You'll feel uncomfortable,

2034
02:05:47.730 --> 02:05:51.420
but other people will not notice anything wrong with you unless you sit down to

2035
02:05:51.421 --> 02:05:54.420
relax with nothing important or interesting to do,

2036
02:05:54.421 --> 02:05:55.860
then very likely you will doze off.

2037
02:05:56.670 --> 02:05:59.340
If you have a job that requires accurate movements are accurate thinking,

2038
02:05:59.341 --> 02:06:01.920
you'll probably make no more mistakes than you usually do.
So let's say,
Hey,

2039
02:06:01.921 --> 02:06:04.080
if you stay up for 24 hours and still be good to go all next day,

2040
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:08.190
which I know you've done this at the muster or close to it,
right?

2041
02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:11.700
We've done like an hour sleep,
two hours say,
but yeah,
I've done it before.

2042
02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:15.960
Maybe for one day.
Yeah.
And like second day you kind of hit the rack realer.
Yeah.

2043
02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:20.550
Big Time.
Yeah.
Uh,
the second night you won't want to stay up,

2044
02:06:20.551 --> 02:06:24.360
but you may have to another March may necessarily the enemy man attack and it's

2045
02:06:24.361 --> 02:06:28.200
the second night and the second night is like the first,
but more difficult.

2046
02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:32.540
It's harder to keep active under your own power yet you can if your officers and

2047
02:06:32.541 --> 02:06:34.140
the enemy furnished the motivation.

2048
02:06:35.610 --> 02:06:38.370
You don't want to keep your mind on any topic very long.

2049
02:06:38.371 --> 02:06:41.670
Your thoughts and ideas will trail off into irrelevancies have.

2050
02:06:41.671 --> 02:06:45.000
You can possibly get a chance to relax.
You will and then you'll go to sleep.

2051
02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:47.340
You ought not to be on century duty,

2052
02:06:47.341 --> 02:06:52.341
but you may keep awake by walking or if you go off into an inattentive days

2053
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:55.020
while you continue walking,

2054
02:06:55.890 --> 02:06:58.680
by this time you will probably getting quite irritable.

2055
02:06:59.130 --> 02:07:01.740
Little things provoke you and you may talk some nonsense.

2056
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:06.390
Your anger does not last though.
You'd rather go to sleep the day after.

2057
02:07:06.391 --> 02:07:10.020
The second.
Sleepless night is better than the preceding sleepless night,

2058
02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:13.890
but you'll be irritable,
rambling and illogical and speech thought.

2059
02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:18.060
An inattentive more than usually sensitive to pain.
Your eyes itch.

2060
02:07:18.061 --> 02:07:20.550
You may begin to see double.
You can't sit down to read.

2061
02:07:20.551 --> 02:07:22.890
Your handwriting becomes bad in Pennsylvania dropped from your hand.

2062
02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:27.930
You may even begin to have a loose imagining events that do not really happen as

2063
02:07:27.931 --> 02:07:30.300
if you begun to dream while you are still awake.

2064
02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:35.450
You can still be spurred to your full mental powers in manual dexterity if the

2065
02:07:35.451 --> 02:07:38.500
stimulus is strong enough.
If your commander demands your attention,

2066
02:07:38.501 --> 02:07:39.490
if a shell comes over,

2067
02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:42.730
but the effect of these things doesn't last as long as it would normally.

2068
02:07:42.731 --> 02:07:45.730
Pretty soon you're going back to where you were with the most important thing in

2069
02:07:45.731 --> 02:07:49.840
your world is to need the need to shut your eyes and go to sleep.

2070
02:07:50.410 --> 02:07:54.220
Wounded soldiers coming out of combat after many days and nights of continuing

2071
02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:58.570
continuous fighting's fighting maybe so terribly in need of sleep,

2072
02:07:58.571 --> 02:08:02.680
that even the severe pain of wounds has not keep them from going sound asleep as

2073
02:08:02.681 --> 02:08:06.520
soon as they are allowed to lie down and aesthetics can be dispensed with.

2074
02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:09.970
So there you go,
there's your,
there's your second day,

2075
02:08:09.971 --> 02:08:14.890
and now you're into your second day of the second full day without sleep.

2076
02:08:15.130 --> 02:08:16.930
How long can you go without sleep?

2077
02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:21.310
You can manage a third night without sleep and maybe a fourth with all the

2078
02:08:21.311 --> 02:08:22.780
symptoms getting worse with attention,

2079
02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:27.580
harder and harder to command with more activity necessary to keep you awake.

2080
02:08:27.581 --> 02:08:30.400
A psychologist wants,
kept himself awake for four whole days,

2081
02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:35.670
spurred only on by scientific motive for seeing what would happen next with dose

2082
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:39.880
doses of a stimulant.
Ben's Adriene,

2083
02:08:39.881 --> 02:08:44.530
which is like an amphetamine which I had to look up to help.
He may actually,

2084
02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:48.610
he actually kept himself awake for eight whole days and seven nights.

2085
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:54.750
There was a man once who believed that sleep was a bad habit which ought to and

2086
02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:57.220
could be overcome.

2087
02:08:58.090 --> 02:09:01.540
He was given a watchman's clock on which to record every 10 minutes.

2088
02:09:01.541 --> 02:09:02.620
The fact that he was awake,

2089
02:09:02.710 --> 02:09:07.690
he stayed awake almost continuously for nine and a half days missing only 31 out

2090
02:09:07.691 --> 02:09:11.890
of 1,380 recordings of the 10 minute intervals.
Of course,

2091
02:09:11.891 --> 02:09:15.730
he got some other cat naps during the 10 minute intervals.
As time wore on,

2092
02:09:15.731 --> 02:09:16.900
he became dazed.

2093
02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:20.710
He could keep appointments at the wrong time or in the wrong place or both.

2094
02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:24.610
He got so he could so that he was not always sure where he was.

2095
02:09:24.611 --> 02:09:25.421
At the end of the time,

2096
02:09:25.421 --> 02:09:29.380
he was beginning to have hallucinations and delusions of persecution and had

2097
02:09:29.381 --> 02:09:33.010
become so cantankerous that the experiment had to be stopped.

2098
02:09:34.110 --> 02:09:36.790
It just turned into so you just got so angry.

2099
02:09:36.930 --> 02:09:40.510
It just had to shut it down like it wasn't like he was going to die.

2100
02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:43.450
He was just real mad at everyone like,
well,
we can't take this anymore,

2101
02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:46.870
so that's pretty accurate.

2102
02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:53.530
Going back to the book,
sleep soon restores the sleepy man or animal.

2103
02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:57.310
The men who stay awake for two or three days are generally in pretty good shape

2104
02:09:57.311 --> 02:10:02.311
after a 12 hour sleep and show no effects at all after two or three normal

2105
02:10:02.531 --> 02:10:06.640
nights.
That's totally true.
You can get yourself back to normal real quick.

2106
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:13.950
The whole trouble and sleeplessness is with attention and thus higher levels of

2107
02:10:14.381 --> 02:10:16.420
the brain which are necessary for attention.

2108
02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:18.690
The soldier who loses sleep is becoming an,

2109
02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:22.330
is becoming inefficient because he can no longer keep his mind on the job,

2110
02:10:22.570 --> 02:10:27.340
on any job except the one job of getting relaxation,
closed eyes and sleep.

2111
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:32.910
He can be stimulated into attention by activity by a foretaste of command by,

2112
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:37.130
but the effect of the spur last less and less as time,

2113
02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:40.940
less and less time as he gets sleepier.
When spurred,

2114
02:10:40.941 --> 02:10:44.330
he can do almost any simple task as about as well as usual,

2115
02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:48.110
unless it is a task that requires attention,
alertness,
and judgement.

2116
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:53.500
Then he begins to fail being frustrated by not being allowed to sleep.

2117
02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:58.460
He becomes irritable,
belligerent,
and perhaps even unmanageable.

2118
02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:01.790
His morale goes down.
He's no longer a good comrade,

2119
02:11:02.710 --> 02:11:05.830
but his recovery will be rapid.
Give him sleep,
which is all he wants,

2120
02:11:05.831 --> 02:11:09.430
and pretty soon he'll be back.
His old competent,
friendly alerts self.

2121
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.590
That's all right in an emergency.

2122
02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:14.770
But ordinarily soldiers should have enough sleep.

2123
02:11:15.490 --> 02:11:20.490
They need to be alert whether for study or combat weather driving a truck in

2124
02:11:20.951 --> 02:11:24.550
America or firing an anti tank gun in Africa or Europe.

2125
02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:29.200
Enough regular sleep from taps to first call should be the rule,

2126
02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:30.580
<v 2>okay?</v>

2127
02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:32.740
<v 0>Except when the enemy decrees.</v>

2128
02:11:32.741 --> 02:11:37.741
Otherwise there is no rule about the amount of sleep that young adults must

2129
02:11:37.751 --> 02:11:38.290
have.

2130
02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:43.290
Some get cranky and irritable when cut down from seven hours a night to five

2131
02:11:44.050 --> 02:11:45.160
others do not.

2132
02:11:45.610 --> 02:11:49.570
The unit with high morale can do with less sleep,

2133
02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:52.630
but sleepy men tend to have low morale.

2134
02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:53.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2135
02:11:53.770 --> 02:11:58.090
<v 0>These two forces work against each other.
There is also,</v>

2136
02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:01.240
there are also no rigid rules about the details of sleep.

2137
02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:05.020
No rules that apply to everyone alike.

2138
02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:07.233
So,
and,

2139
02:12:07.330 --> 02:12:11.320
and actually it's interesting because I'm here right now on a very minimal

2140
02:12:11.321 --> 02:12:16.030
amount of sleep.
I had a meet,
I had to fly to DC,
I had a meeting in DC.

2141
02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:17.290
It went late

2142
02:12:19.330 --> 02:12:24.190
and when I got done with the meeting,
got back to my hotel at midnight.

2143
02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:26.400
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2144
02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:30.540
<v 0>I had to prep this podcast.
I was on west coast time,
so I was like,</v>

2145
02:12:30.541 --> 02:12:32.580
well it's only 10 o'clock or whatever,

2146
02:12:32.581 --> 02:12:35.880
nine o'clock so I just stayed awake.

2147
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.680
My car pickup was it three?
I probably slept 40 minutes

2148
02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:43.950
and then we'll,

2149
02:12:43.951 --> 02:12:47.640
but then I did sleep on the plane flying back from the east coast out to here.

2150
02:12:47.970 --> 02:12:51.150
I got at least probably three hours of sleep.

2151
02:12:51.151 --> 02:12:54.870
They're uncomfortable or not.
Is that even sleep?

2152
02:12:54.871 --> 02:12:58.470
We don't know what does that count as?
Yeah.
And

2153
02:12:59.590 --> 02:13:00.300
<v 2>okay.</v>

2154
02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:04.320
<v 0>Not Try not,
don't have much sleep right now.
We do a pretty good,
yeah,</v>

2155
02:13:04.321 --> 02:13:09.030
it doesn't matter.
We'll be,
you know when people,
people call you can't perform.

2156
02:13:09.031 --> 02:13:12.450
I don't,
I don't know.
And people freak out and say you cannot,

2157
02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:15.700
there's no way you can perform as well when you're sleeping.

2158
02:13:15.701 --> 02:13:20.070
If you don't have enough sleep.
It's like,
Bro,
I get it.
Hey,
I'm not anti sleep.

2159
02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:24.390
If you need to sleep,
man,
sleep as much as you can sleep as much as you can.

2160
02:13:24.391 --> 02:13:27.870
See eight hours a day sleep,
10 hours date.
I don't care.
I'm not against you.

2161
02:13:27.871 --> 02:13:32.550
I don't hold it against you.
But there's things,
number one,

2162
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.460
if you have a lot of things that you need to do and you spend a lot of time in

2163
02:13:38.461 --> 02:13:40.620
bed,
the things that you need to do aren't going to happen.

2164
02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:44.910
So you may need to get out of bed and get things to happen.
And number two,

2165
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:49.650
I don't even,
I have horrible feeling if I sleep a lot.
Yeah.
Not,

2166
02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:50.850
not just,
okay.

2167
02:13:50.851 --> 02:13:54.390
I feel bad because I missed on doing some stuff that I'd probably needed to do.

2168
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:58.060
Also,
I don't feel more rested.
Oh yeah.
Okay.

2169
02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:00.990
I don't feel more rested if I sleep eight hours,

2170
02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:06.000
I feel sometimes it worse.
So,

2171
02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:11.350
<v 4>yeah.
And he essentially said everyone's different.
Yes.</v>

2172
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:16.470
A hundred percent complete opposite.
I feel way more rested.

2173
02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:21.180
It's even seven hours.
I'm good.
Six hours is,
I'm fine.
Six hours,

2174
02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:24.660
two days in a row,
I'm not.
That's when those symptoms start to creep in.

2175
02:14:25.110 --> 02:14:28.110
Seven hours every single day.
Fine.
Eight hours.

2176
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:33.180
I feel like a booth,
like I'm,
yeah,
nine hours.

2177
02:14:33.181 --> 02:14:36.540
I don't know if I would could go nine hours more than one or two nights in a
row.

2178
02:14:36.570 --> 02:14:37.500
Like just physically.

2179
02:14:37.501 --> 02:14:39.880
I just pick up whatever boy I could do the night hours and night,

2180
02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:42.720
<v 0>like saw all it,
all it salad.</v>

2181
02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:46.650
I'll have to try some something out off to try it out and see if I feel more
soft

2182
02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:51.870
<v 4>live
for you.
You know?
Um,
like you said,</v>

2183
02:14:51.871 --> 02:14:55.530
people will say,
hey,
you,
you,
there's no way you can perform at your,

2184
02:14:55.590 --> 02:14:59.550
at your highest if you're sleep deprived or whatever.
Whatever I would imagine.

2185
02:14:59.551 --> 02:15:03.510
Just like,
cause you know how to say in here that everyone's different.

2186
02:15:03.511 --> 02:15:08.511
Like your optimum versus your subtle optimum mum might be like super small mom,

2187
02:15:08.610 --> 02:15:10.310
you know,
where you know,

2188
02:15:10.350 --> 02:15:14.010
you feel a little teeny tiny effects but your output or the results of your

2189
02:15:14.011 --> 02:15:15.630
output or whatever are pretty similar.

2190
02:15:15.631 --> 02:15:20.460
They're almost an pretty much unnoticeable even though you could have done a

2191
02:15:20.461 --> 02:15:23.420
little bit better with more sleep kind of thing.
But you know,
just like,

2192
02:15:23.610 --> 02:15:26.760
and then opposed to me where man I go five hours of sleep.

2193
02:15:26.761 --> 02:15:29.610
The difference between six hours of sleep and five of the sleep for me is like,

2194
02:15:29.611 --> 02:15:33.180
I feel like a completely different person like there.
Yeah.
Aw Man.

2195
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:36.060
There was one time it was like,
I remember,

2196
02:15:36.061 --> 02:15:38.670
cause I was talking to [inaudible] so it was a time when life was in town.

2197
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:42.390
I got like very hardly any hours asleep.

2198
02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:46.800
And I remember talking to him and thinking per leaf Vincam thinks I'm stupid or

2199
02:15:47.130 --> 02:15:49.410
just cause I didn't even really make sense.

2200
02:15:49.411 --> 02:15:52.980
I mean I don't know if he noticed it but I noticed it.
But then yeah,

2201
02:15:52.981 --> 02:15:55.290
if they got like six or seven or whatever's cool.

2202
02:15:55.670 --> 02:15:57.650
<v 0>Well for everyone that freaks out.</v>

2203
02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:04.010
I'm not saying don't save sleep,
sleep a bunch.
Sleep all you want.

2204
02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:06.373
That's fine.

2205
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:11.410
<v 4>You don't sound very confident or you don't sound very like,</v>

2206
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:13.100
well it's probably because

2207
02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:19.450
<v 0>I don't,
cause you only got three hours of sleep.
Yeah,
you're irritable.</v>

2208
02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:21.220
You're here in the morning because

2209
02:16:23.050 --> 02:16:26.140
I get that you should sleep.

2210
02:16:26.170 --> 02:16:29.010
But I think people take advantage of it real quick.
That makes any,

2211
02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:30.190
they start just getting

2212
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:33.010
<v 3>into the,
you know,
I am just going to sleep all the time.</v>

2213
02:16:33.011 --> 02:16:35.170
It's like when someone says dark chocolate's good for you.

2214
02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:40.570
You don't know say chocolate cake.
Yeah.
And then it's like,

2215
02:16:40.571 --> 02:16:43.750
well does that include dark chocolate cake?
Is that include dark chocolate,

2216
02:16:43.751 --> 02:16:46.810
triple fudge ice cream?
Cause the dark chocolate is good for you.

2217
02:16:46.811 --> 02:16:51.120
So I'm in the game,
so sleep is good for me,
so I'm not getting out of bed.
So,

2218
02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.990
but whatever,
I encourage people to sleep and I,
it's not,

2219
02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:59.260
the other thing is that it's crazy.
It's,
it's not like I don't sleep.
I sleep,

2220
02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:01.690
I sleep almost every day.

2221
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:08.980
You know what I mean?
It's good.
I go almost every day.
I sleep.
No,
I see.

2222
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:14.190
Just about every day I go to bed at 01030111130 somewhere in there.

2223
02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:21.060
I wake up at four 30 maybe for 20 maybe four 32 but that's a lot of sleep.

2224
02:17:25.090 --> 02:17:29.200
You know,
that's between five and six hours every day.
Yeah.

2225
02:17:29.201 --> 02:17:32.410
I mean it guests for your standard,
but two people freaking out,

2226
02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:35.770
so no reason.
Well,
you know what I mean?

2227
02:17:35.771 --> 02:17:38.440
For people who are sleep deprived and they do have differences,

2228
02:17:38.441 --> 02:17:42.040
which very much I do know,
I do know this for a fact.

2229
02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:46.650
When I have less sleep,
I'm more emotional.
Oh yeah.

2230
02:17:46.810 --> 02:17:51.550
And,
and you know what?
I actually,
it actually is helpful for me.

2231
02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:55.870
Oh Dang.
Oh yeah.
Like I like to be sleep deprived to somewhat,

2232
02:17:56.050 --> 02:17:59.830
I don't session and say say I like to sleep a little bit less because it's more,

2233
02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:01.720
it makes more,

2234
02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:05.610
it makes my life a little bit more on edge,
which I like.

2235
02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:08.230
Actually what's funny is you said that one time when you were like,

2236
02:18:08.231 --> 02:18:12.300
I like a little bit of Sleep Dep.
That was weird when you told me.
I was like,

2237
02:18:12.301 --> 02:18:14.230
I guess I see what you're saying cause it Kinda,

2238
02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:17.680
it's almost like a comfort thing,
right?
Like if you're too comfortable,

2239
02:18:17.681 --> 02:18:22.630
like you might be more inclined to relax almost kinda idea even though,

2240
02:18:22.631 --> 02:18:27.310
I mean I can't really get down with it because the more rested I am the more

2241
02:18:27.311 --> 02:18:28.230
happier I'm going to feel.

2242
02:18:29.050 --> 02:18:32.620
Like you say emotional and in the book it's an irritable right there.

2243
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:36.490
I think it's the same thing with irritable,

2244
02:18:36.491 --> 02:18:38.920
like to kind of like I'm irritable with like stuff,

2245
02:18:38.921 --> 02:18:42.290
not even inanimate stuff like the my,

2246
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:46.720
my phone isn't connected to my Bluetooth in my car quick enough.

2247
02:18:46.721 --> 02:18:49.270
I'm like what still is wrong with this thing in my head,
you know,

2248
02:18:49.450 --> 02:18:53.260
that kind of stuff even.
But then if I'm rested pat,
no,
no factor.

2249
02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:56.000
Maybe it won't work at all.
I don't care if I had to see,

2250
02:18:56.170 --> 02:18:59.860
I like that little bit of edge cause part of it is because things like that

2251
02:18:59.861 --> 02:19:03.050
never bothered me.
So it was or whatever my phone didn't conduct to.

2252
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:07.520
So you're kind of dead.
Yeah,
I'd rather bring it back to life.

2253
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:11.800
A little bit of anger,
irritability,
make it good.

2254
02:19:12.550 --> 02:19:13.360
Anyways,

2255
02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:18.360
so that's where I want to stop for this podcast about this book and on the next

2256
02:19:20.411 --> 02:19:21.070
book,

2257
02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:24.690
and actually this is like the warm up and I think the second half of the book
is,

2258
02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:28.010
is even better.
It's when it gets into the morale,

2259
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:29.570
<v 0>it's when it gets into leadership,</v>

2260
02:19:29.571 --> 02:19:33.620
it's when it gets into the psychological warfare office and defense.

2261
02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:37.790
And so we'll pick that up on the next podcast.

2262
02:19:37.791 --> 02:19:42.770
I want to do one more little passage from this book here.

2263
02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:47.840
It's a shorter passage,
but it's just,
uh,
again,
just to,

2264
02:19:47.841 --> 02:19:49.250
just a reminder of what,

2265
02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:55.720
what war is going back to and we go on by,

2266
02:19:55.821 --> 02:20:00.560
we'll bird,
here we go.
We found the platoon and hardly recognized it.

2267
02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:05.180
The sergeant was there and Mcdonald's,
but the rest were strangers.

2268
02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:11.290
They told me that the 73rd of the fourth division had been so caught up that

2269
02:20:12.261 --> 02:20:16.490
they had been withdrawn and the 85th Nova Scotia highlanders had taken their

2270
02:20:16.491 --> 02:20:17.324
place.

2271
02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:23.200
The remnant of the 73rd had been divided between us and the 13th I got

2272
02:20:24.081 --> 02:20:26.660
McDonald's the one side and ask questions.

2273
02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:28.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2274
02:20:28.140 --> 02:20:29.850
<v 0>It was far worse than I thought.</v>

2275
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:30.990
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2276
02:20:30.990 --> 02:20:35.040
<v 0>The 42nd had gone straight through to their objective.</v>

2277
02:20:35.041 --> 02:20:36.040
Despite the sleet,

2278
02:20:36.041 --> 02:20:41.041
the snow and mud and confusion had driven back all opposition and sees their

2279
02:20:41.410 --> 02:20:44.690
objective,
but on their left,

2280
02:20:44.691 --> 02:20:49.691
the fourth division had been held up and a flanking fire had taken a heavy toll.

2281
02:20:51.570 --> 02:20:54.050
Freddie was gone.
He had predict.

2282
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:59.070
He had predicted truly a big shell had landed beside him killing him and burying

2283
02:21:00.511 --> 02:21:01.344
him.

2284
02:21:02.350 --> 02:21:05.950
Charlie had fallen in the first rush riddled with bullets.

2285
02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:07.361
Joe,

2286
02:21:07.361 --> 02:21:12.361
the [inaudible] policemen had fought through to the objective and had been

2287
02:21:12.401 --> 02:21:14.200
killed by a sniper on the flank.

2288
02:21:15.690 --> 02:21:20.690
One shell had wiped out Stevenson thorough and Roy as they grouped by a captured

2289
02:21:22.201 --> 02:21:23.034
gun.

2290
02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:24.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2291
02:21:24.370 --> 02:21:28.480
<v 0>Mcmillan had been shot in the stomach and it died after waiting hours in a</v>

2292
02:21:28.481 --> 02:21:31.480
trench.
Billy,

2293
02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:35.800
the complainer had fallen as he had charged a machine gun keeping on until he

2294
02:21:35.801 --> 02:21:37.900
was almost within reach of the gunners.

2295
02:21:40.020 --> 02:21:45.020
Little Gilroy had been killed and Westcott smelly had been wounded,

2296
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.880
huggy.

2297
02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:54.880
The sergeant had been defied and it had been wounded at the same time and had

2298
02:21:56.191 --> 02:21:59.880
been taken away together.
Big Herman was missing.

2299
02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:02.280
They load co located his body.

2300
02:22:02.281 --> 02:22:06.240
A month later that morning you'd shaken hands with Freddy,

2301
02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:10.470
said goodbye to him and then we had,
when he had got going,

2302
02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:11.850
had run a muck.

2303
02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:16.980
He was found almost at the bottom of the ridge near a battery position with

2304
02:22:16.981 --> 02:22:21.720
eight dead Germans about him.
Four of them killed by bad debt

2305
02:22:24.330 --> 02:22:29.330
in the other besides Tommy slim and Joe had survived and Irin Sam and big Glenn

2306
02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:35.040
and Eddie and Mickey and Jerry.

2307
02:22:36.030 --> 02:22:40.140
They sat in the dug out that night after a hard day of rebuilding roads,

2308
02:22:40.141 --> 02:22:45.141
each man's suffering from bodily fatigue and crawling with vermin and the clam,

2309
02:22:46.001 --> 02:22:50.730
he chill of mud.
Kate clothing,
their faces,
brooding,
enigmatic,

2310
02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:54.780
even Mickey's curiously odd,
only their eyes moving.

2311
02:22:57.110 --> 02:23:00.970
They would not talk about the fighting and seemed utterly worn.

2312
02:23:03.310 --> 02:23:04.510
Six months ago,

2313
02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:09.840
we had marched eagerly bravely are tin hats askew and with a cheeky retort for

2314
02:23:10.871 --> 02:23:14.770
every comment,
Heidi,
whatever secret apprehensions we had,

2315
02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:16.210
not knowing the heavy,

2316
02:23:16.270 --> 02:23:21.270
ominous silence that follows the burst of big shells and the cries of the

2317
02:23:21.371 --> 02:23:26.371
wounded not knowing what it is to scrape a hasty grave at night.

2318
02:23:28.030 --> 02:23:29.480
And there Barry,

2319
02:23:29.481 --> 02:23:34.481
a man who has worked with you and slept with you since you enlisted.

2320
02:23:41.410 --> 02:23:44.470
Clearly,
war is hell.

2321
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:49.110
It's a physical and it is a psychological hill.

2322
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:53.600
And the more we know about it,

2323
02:23:55.100 --> 02:24:00.020
the more we should understand that war is to be avoided as much as humanly

2324
02:24:00.021 --> 02:24:00.854
possible.

2325
02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:08.540
But it also teaches us how strong we as human beings can be.

2326
02:24:09.771 --> 02:24:11.150
What we can overcome.

2327
02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:17.570
It teaches us the importance of training,
the importance of preparation,

2328
02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:22.700
the importance of will not only the will to win in war,

2329
02:24:24.910 --> 02:24:28.000
but the will to carry on and to win

2330
02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:30.333
<v 1>in life.</v>

2331
02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:35.660
<v 0>And we all have that power.</v>

2332
02:24:36.770 --> 02:24:37.603
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2333
02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:39.410
<v 0>we just need to find it.</v>

2334
02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:42.320
<v 1>Okay.
And to win.</v>

2335
02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:46.960
<v 0>And I think that's all I've got tonight.</v>

2336
02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:52.480
So Echo Charles.
Speaking of

2337
02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:55.153
<v 1>winning,</v>

2338
02:24:56.060 --> 02:25:01.060
<v 0>I know we are sort of trying to be on the path of winning mentally,</v>

2339
02:25:01.671 --> 02:25:02.271
physically,

2340
02:25:02.271 --> 02:25:06.710
psychologically in life and on the mats.

2341
02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:08.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2342
02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:13.420
<v 0>And I know that's sort of the thing we're doing here,
the movement.
Sure.</v>

2343
02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:18.470
And I know you have some recommendations for that.
Yes.
Might be helpful.
Yes.

2344
02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:22.850
They will be helpful actually.
Nice.
Nice.
What do you got?

2345
02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:24.273
I have,

2346
02:25:24.310 --> 02:25:29.150
<v 4>well,
we're on the path,
right?
We got that week war.
Life is war.
We're at</v>

2347
02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.290
war.
All out war.
All out war on that war.
No,

2348
02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:40.240
total war.
Podo work.
That's what we're in.
Yes.
Total war.

2349
02:25:40.241 --> 02:25:43.910
So we'd be in that total war.
There's little battles,
right?

2350
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:49.060
So I think people are not going to like that.
What life is war.

2351
02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:52.090
But it's so true.
Yeah,
I mean it,

2352
02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:55.390
I mean if you start looking at your life like it's war,

2353
02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:57.170
it's going to make you better.
Yet,

2354
02:25:57.820 --> 02:26:02.020
if you look at every day as a war on multiple fronts,

2355
02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:05.980
you know that you have to fight where victory is the only choice.

2356
02:26:06.730 --> 02:26:09.400
You're going to have a better life actually.
It's really,
yeah,
it's really good.

2357
02:26:09.401 --> 02:26:13.360
Even for someone who look,
I get it.
The word war might trigger some people.

2358
02:26:13.390 --> 02:26:16.090
I get it.
It's just like the word fight might trigger some people,

2359
02:26:16.091 --> 02:26:19.810
but you could say life is a fight.
It's always a fight,
not against people.

2360
02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:24.820
My suspicion is the amount of people listening to this podcast that are

2361
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:29.170
triggered by the word to war or fight is zero.
Zero.
Yes,
I agree with you.

2362
02:26:29.171 --> 02:26:31.450
That's my suspicion.
I could be wrong,

2363
02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:34.600
but they're severely triggered at this point if that's where they're at.

2364
02:26:35.770 --> 02:26:39.940
That's the only thing we talk about is fighting in war.
Yes.
I think you're right.

2365
02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:42.720
I believe you are right.

2366
02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:47.320
Making sure so within the all out war there's little battles,

2367
02:26:47.530 --> 02:26:50.110
right,
and in those battles,

2368
02:26:50.770 --> 02:26:53.290
one of those battles is the Jujitsu.

2369
02:26:55.690 --> 02:27:00.400
When you do this,
you're going to need a g and a rash guard just to begin.

2370
02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:01.730
That's why I think so.

2371
02:27:01.810 --> 02:27:04.550
Actually technically you could wear basketball shorts and a tank top.

2372
02:27:04.570 --> 02:27:08.270
You could not recommend and I recommend,
especially the basketball shorts.
Yeah.

2373
02:27:08.271 --> 02:27:13.120
They will be pulled down,
pull down,
pulled up,
caught on people's toes.

2374
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:17.080
Sometimes just not a good plan.
Not as good as like,
yeah,

2375
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:22.090
maybe some board shorts.
They don't.
As far as,
yeah.
Nonetheless,

2376
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:24.790
this is where you can get these things from origin,
origin,

2377
02:27:24.791 --> 02:27:28.810
main.com that's where you go get a rash guard,

2378
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:32.080
get a geat best game in the world.
Factually,
by the way,

2379
02:27:33.370 --> 02:27:35.170
also happens to be made in America.

2380
02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:37.840
Are they the best because they're made in America?
Maybe,
maybe not,

2381
02:27:38.260 --> 02:27:42.640
but those are two separate either way.
Reminded,
Oh yeah,
best games in the world.

2382
02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:47.320
Many different options there.
Also,
grass cards,
like I said,
also joggers.

2383
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:53.320
Yeah,
like I said before,
but yeah,
a lot of clothes.
Apparel.

2384
02:27:53.350 --> 02:27:57.220
We'll say.
What you're missing is jeans.
Yes,

2385
02:27:57.730 --> 02:28:02.020
there are genes.
Wait,
can we get genes now?
We should be getting jeans now.

2386
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:06.760
I know I have origin jeans.
I know I'm in a little bit of a preferred scenario.

2387
02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:10.300
I know people.
Yeah,
so I was going to say,
wait,

2388
02:28:10.301 --> 02:28:13.650
if we can all get jeans now that's interesting because I didn't get any.
Yeah,

2389
02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:17.110
well,
the genes are being made at this time,

2390
02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:21.760
so they're available.
We'll denim,

2391
02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:22.760
American denim,

2392
02:28:22.850 --> 02:28:26.960
American made best jeans ever obviously.

2393
02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:28.850
And yeah,

2394
02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:33.880
check 'em out or do you mean.com also supplements best kind of supplements.

2395
02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:39.940
So I've can't come to the conclusion that the harsh conclusion and that exercise

2396
02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:46.670
generally speaking is probably the best thing you can do for yourself.

2397
02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:50.720
Agree.
Generally speaking,
I'm not saying there's no exceptions,

2398
02:28:50.721 --> 02:28:51.554
I'm not saying that.

2399
02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:57.230
And you're not saying that throw everything else into the dumpster.
Correct?
Yes.

2400
02:28:57.470 --> 02:29:00.950
So when,
when it comes to supplements,
okay,
well,
so what is,

2401
02:29:00.980 --> 02:29:02.960
what's the best kind of supplements to take then?

2402
02:29:03.410 --> 02:29:07.220
If we understand that exercise is the best thing you can do for yourself,

2403
02:29:07.221 --> 02:29:08.090
what kind of supplements?

2404
02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:12.890
Is it like muscle building supplements or is it,

2405
02:29:12.891 --> 02:29:15.050
this is what I'm asking myself as I'm driving.

2406
02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:20.890
Cause they drive sometimes or is it the kind of supplement that allows you to

2407
02:29:21.051 --> 02:29:25.580
stay able to exercise at full capacity longer?

2408
02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:29.120
Probably those,
right?
I know what you think.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2409
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:34.160
Mozhan you like to joint warfare Krill oil.
Yes sir.
You liked the discipline,

2410
02:29:34.310 --> 02:29:38.600
right?
Because,
and I say this because it's not selfish.
It's not just intuitive.

2411
02:29:38.810 --> 02:29:42.020
You think supplements to give my body bigger or whatever.
Stronger.

2412
02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:44.840
But what if you do want to get more yoke to let's say,

2413
02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:47.300
how would you get some of that mold?
Like you said,

2414
02:29:47.301 --> 02:29:50.480
we don't throw everything else into the dumpster.

2415
02:29:50.481 --> 02:29:55.070
I'm just saying this is [inaudible] road and I eating whatever and when I go on

2416
02:29:55.071 --> 02:29:56.510
the road I go on a trip,
I eat.

2417
02:29:56.780 --> 02:30:00.320
I usually really good cause I go on a steak restaurants and I get rib eyes.

2418
02:30:00.410 --> 02:30:03.890
Yes sir.
And no matter what,
when I come home I want to have more.
Yeah.

2419
02:30:03.891 --> 02:30:06.950
Cause I have that mint chocolate chip Monck cause it's like a dessert.

2420
02:30:07.170 --> 02:30:08.110
It is a disease.

2421
02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:12.710
Without the guilt we actually crap.

2422
02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:16.660
Yeah that yes.
Literally good for you.
How can you get to dessert?

2423
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:18.050
That's actually good for you.

2424
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:21.110
I'll tell you how you got to origin main.com you give them.
Okay.

2425
02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:24.770
If you've got kids instead of feeding kids junk,

2426
02:30:25.310 --> 02:30:28.640
that's horrible for them.
You get them some warrior kid milk,

2427
02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:33.700
you will have kids that want to drink something that's awesome for them.
Yup.

2428
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.200
And by then it's a meal by the way.

2429
02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:40.070
They will be stoked to get your sick kids.

2430
02:30:40.071 --> 02:30:41.840
Some warrior kid milk.

2431
02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:46.760
Tasty people would ask him about when the strawberry adult Moke is coming out.

2432
02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:50.630
I told me,
I told the little,
do not mess this up.

2433
02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:55.640
I'm like the strawberry kids.
Mark is APIC.
It's epic.

2434
02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:58.870
Yeah.
I said if you mess up and the,

2435
02:30:58.970 --> 02:31:03.200
and the adult strawberry milk is an APP,
beck,
we're going to have an issue.

2436
02:31:04.130 --> 02:31:08.270
That's a problem.
Be Little's on the case.
Yeah.

2437
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:12.830
Well he's on the case yet.
It's true.
Also,
Jack was the store.

2438
02:31:13.220 --> 02:31:14.420
It's called Jocko store,

2439
02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:20.050
so go to juggle store.com this is where you can get shirts,

2440
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:23.010
hoodies,
rap,
more rash guards,

2441
02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:27.060
all representative of this path that we're on.

2442
02:31:27.490 --> 02:31:29.100
We're on the path certainly,

2443
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:32.280
and we're going to stay on the path where you stay on the path until the path

2444
02:31:32.281 --> 02:31:33.540
path ends.
And guess what?

2445
02:31:33.570 --> 02:31:37.550
The little answer to that little riddle about doesn't it?
So,

2446
02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:40.740
but if you want to represent Jocko,
store.com got some new stuff on there.

2447
02:31:40.741 --> 02:31:44.160
By the way,
we're a little new design of the hoodies,
you know,

2448
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:48.420
really like that one nonetheless.
Hey look,
go check it out.

2449
02:31:48.450 --> 02:31:53.280
If you like something or something.
Triggers.
Stickers are some,

2450
02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:57.060
uh,
yeah,
but there's bumper stickers on there.
This patches on there.
There's more.

2451
02:31:57.061 --> 02:31:59.220
I just designed a new rash guard.

2452
02:31:59.250 --> 02:32:02.940
It's not like totally new with a new rash guard sent it to Pete.

2453
02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:06.580
We're getting it done and should be there and a,
you know,
within the week.
Um,

2454
02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:10.890
also I know week to you talk a lot of trash to me about lightweight hoodies.

2455
02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:14.800
We're going to do a lightweight Hoodie,
100% despite pipe.
Okay.

2456
02:32:15.450 --> 02:32:19.200
Jocko unapproved.
But when you see it,
it's going to be approved anyway.

2457
02:32:19.260 --> 02:32:22.110
If you like something gets on.
If I was going to wear a lightweight Hoodie,

2458
02:32:22.111 --> 02:32:25.860
I would just wear a tee shirt,
bro.
Yeah,
I did it.
But some of us,
you know,

2459
02:32:25.861 --> 02:32:29.190
we liked that there's like this little intermediary pose,

2460
02:32:29.260 --> 02:32:32.280
a situation where it's not hot,

2461
02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:35.940
it's cold,
but it's not cold cold.

2462
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:39.720
You don't like when the wind sort of blows consistently and you're like,

2463
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:40.020
you know,

2464
02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:45.020
I couldn't think we by the grace of decentralized command that this is

2465
02:32:45.211 --> 02:32:48.950
happening.
Yes.
Because despite spite what you're saying to me,
yes.

2466
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:50.520
A medium or whatever.

2467
02:32:50.521 --> 02:32:55.521
You said a light weight hoodie makes no logical sense to me as a human.

2468
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:58.820
You know,
that's one of the many differences between me and you can.

2469
02:32:58.860 --> 02:33:02.670
I think that there are a lot of people out there who support me on this
decision,

2470
02:33:02.671 --> 02:33:07.040
which is why we will track and see if anyone buys lightweight.

2471
02:33:07.230 --> 02:33:11.610
Just go into the numbers.
Okay.
I understand.
Also,
there's women's stuff.

2472
02:33:11.700 --> 02:33:16.170
Present them to the people.
Yeah.
Cool.
Well,
there it is.
Yeah.
Anyway,
Jocko,

2473
02:33:16.171 --> 02:33:19.110
store.com there's some women's stuff on there.
Then there's cool stuff.

2474
02:33:19.111 --> 02:33:23.220
You've liked something,
get something.
It's a good way to represent for sure.
Also,

2475
02:33:23.250 --> 02:33:28.200
Jocko white tea,
if you want to deadlift 8,000 pounds if you're not already.

2476
02:33:28.201 --> 02:33:30.330
Okay.
This is the reason or one of the reasons,

2477
02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:33.440
unless you're already a tea drinker,
even if you're not a teacher,

2478
02:33:33.450 --> 02:33:36.300
because I wasn't teaching anchor Nigerian Jocko White Tea,

2479
02:33:36.330 --> 02:33:40.500
so I am a teacher in cartel.
Technically.
This is the original.

2480
02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:44.530
This is like the first thing.
What?
I'm going to make something,

2481
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:49.020
I'm going to make this tea.
Oh,
the university is the front of the product.

2482
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:53.340
It some on the way over here.
Yeah.
You know,
it's funny,
man.

2483
02:33:53.341 --> 02:33:56.760
If you kind of guess I was a little bit chilly.
I wanted some warm tea.

2484
02:33:56.761 --> 02:33:58.080
I could have used a little lightweight.

2485
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:06.660
Anyway,
it's interesting how all these products is all stuff that you use.

2486
02:34:06.661 --> 02:34:10.590
So you're like,
you're like walking,
not walking,
but you're just sorta existing.

2487
02:34:10.591 --> 02:34:13.290
You're like,
hmm.
Instead of like,
you know,
getting this stuff.

2488
02:34:13.291 --> 02:34:17.190
Let me just make it so,
and it turns out you make all your own stuff.
Well,

2489
02:34:17.350 --> 02:34:18.310
the thing is

2490
02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:21.370
<v 3>if you're going to,
I'm picky.
That's my problem.</v>

2491
02:34:21.610 --> 02:34:26.020
I'm picky about what I like and what I don't like.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well,

2492
02:34:26.021 --> 02:34:27.760
I'm straight forward,
but I'm picky.

2493
02:34:27.761 --> 02:34:32.110
I want this specific thing a specific way and you can't buy what I want or you

2494
02:34:32.111 --> 02:34:35.440
couldn't,
you couldn't buy what I want now.

2495
02:34:35.441 --> 02:34:39.880
You can just do what I want.
It's just like everything,
like the g,

2496
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:44.380
like victory,
MMA and fitness,
our gym.
Why is that?
Why does it exist?

2497
02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:48.280
Because we want it to have the way we want things to be.
You can't just,

2498
02:34:48.281 --> 02:34:51.850
you can't go to someone else's gym and expect it to be the way you want it.

2499
02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:56.560
You can't buy some supplement off the shelf and expect it to taste the way you

2500
02:34:56.561 --> 02:34:57.311
want it to taste.

2501
02:34:57.311 --> 02:35:02.311
It's going to taste the way some random person in some other area,

2502
02:35:04.090 --> 02:35:08.090
you wanted it to taste.
They don't know what tastes good.
Yeah.
Well,

2503
02:35:08.740 --> 02:35:10.850
and they're going to take,
once they figure they had to put in the,

2504
02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:15.340
they're just trying to make the maximum profit margin so they're putting

2505
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:20.440
feelers,
whatever.
So anyways,
make totally mix.

2506
02:35:20.470 --> 02:35:23.950
If you're going to make something then if you have to,
you,

2507
02:35:23.951 --> 02:35:27.640
if you want to use something,
why not make it the way you want it?
Origin genes,

2508
02:35:27.641 --> 02:35:28.090
by the way.

2509
02:35:28.090 --> 02:35:33.090
Same thing the way I want them to be made to way Pete likes all made,

2510
02:35:34.270 --> 02:35:38.620
you know,
in America.
So anyways,
yeah.
That's how we ended up doing this stuff.

2511
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:43.550
Cool.
Boom.
Yeah.
Good.
I'm glad you did by the way.
Oh,
and uh,

2512
02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:47.140
there's some people we joked about subscribing to the podcast.

2513
02:35:47.170 --> 02:35:51.400
I saw some comments that people didn't,

2514
02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:56.290
hadn't subscribed the podcast until the last show.
This dude was like,

2515
02:35:56.291 --> 02:36:01.291
I listened to 163 episodes and I never subscribed to the podcast until you said

2516
02:36:01.841 --> 02:36:06.520
and joked about who would listen to 163 episodes and not subscribe to the

2517
02:36:06.521 --> 02:36:09.220
podcast.
And he said that was me.

2518
02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:13.990
So there might be one other person out there that hasn't subscribed to the

2519
02:36:13.991 --> 02:36:18.991
podcast or hasn't subscribed to the youtube channel or hasn't subscribed to the

2520
02:36:19.001 --> 02:36:20.830
warrior kid podcast.

2521
02:36:21.730 --> 02:36:25.930
So if you haven't subscribed to those things do so wait,

2522
02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.220
what do you mean you stand corrected?

2523
02:36:27.250 --> 02:36:29.890
You're the one that always says like there might be someone that's an,

2524
02:36:29.891 --> 02:36:34.690
I didn't believe you.
I think,
I don't know if I'd ever say for subscribing,

2525
02:36:35.290 --> 02:36:37.150
but it was yes,

2526
02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:42.400
I always said or feel that it seems obvious.
Yes to subscribe,

2527
02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:44.050
subscribe.

2528
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:48.310
And I always thought that that was dumb and I thought to myself who could listen

2529
02:36:48.311 --> 02:36:51.460
to this podcast over and over get an,
not subscribed to it,

2530
02:36:51.461 --> 02:36:53.960
but that rubbed off on me and I started to feel that way.
In fact,

2531
02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:56.710
cause right now I'm trying to search my feelings and I do feel that way.

2532
02:36:56.711 --> 02:36:59.570
Like why are you telling people to subscribe?

2533
02:36:59.571 --> 02:37:00.640
So we don't need to say this anymore.

2534
02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:04.270
But now what I'm saying is we got reports back from the field of people that

2535
02:37:04.271 --> 02:37:09.130
didn't subscribe yet.
162 podcast deep,
huh?

2536
02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.230
And now we're 164 podcasts.

2537
02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:13.010
If you have them subscribe to the podcast subscribers.

2538
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:16.190
If you check out the youtube channel,
by the way,

2539
02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:20.210
the youtube channel echoes videos are on there.
He's real proud of him.

2540
02:37:24.410 --> 02:37:26.990
He's real proud of him.
He puts little things exploding.

2541
02:37:27.890 --> 02:37:30.260
Some people think it's too much.
Well,

2542
02:37:30.570 --> 02:37:34.490
some people think it's sometimes they're,
sometimes they're right in there.

2543
02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:38.870
It's a dichotomy.
You gotta balance that iconomy no,
I have no effects.

2544
02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:39.830
Too many effects.

2545
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:44.430
There's varying levels of appropriateness with affects.

2546
02:37:45.310 --> 02:37:49.220
So at some point I want you to purposely make a video that's completely,

2547
02:37:49.221 --> 02:37:52.910
you take whatever I've said on this podcast that's over the top anyways,

2548
02:37:52.911 --> 02:37:55.610
and then just make the most over the top video.
That is a good,

2549
02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:59.960
I remember one time I said,
don't sleep,
eat steak,

2550
02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:03.440
train her or something like that.
That's what,

2551
02:38:03.441 --> 02:38:05.320
that's what the video should it be about that?

2552
02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:10.160
Just guys with broken legs crawling out on the mat with a steak hanging out of

2553
02:38:10.161 --> 02:38:13.790
their mouth,
you know,
like that kind of thing over the top.

2554
02:38:13.791 --> 02:38:17.270
Everything exploding a fire because lot of times your explosion is don't have

2555
02:38:17.271 --> 02:38:21.710
fire.
A lot of times they're just smoking more,
more like smoking dust.

2556
02:38:22.610 --> 02:38:27.380
You keep it dark.
Explosions more just like dis rent,

2557
02:38:27.410 --> 02:38:29.360
like various levels of destruction.

2558
02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:35.300

Well.
Yeah,
I thought you didn't say that.

2568
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:17.720
Okay.
I think I missed them.
That's nice nonetheless.

Just like this.

2571
02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:27.380
Just like this book man.
Very much.
So.

2573
02:39:32.811 --> 02:39:35.720
Go on [inaudible] dot com slash travel this is where you can get kettlebells,

2574
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:41.060
add to your home gym,
add to your capability.
Rings.
Add to that.
Keep me.

2575
02:39:41.061 --> 02:39:45.980
But I just got some,
uh,
the storm trooper on Star Wars.
Straight up pop right.

2576
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.710
Don't hate on that Russ third.
They're dope.
None the less.

2577
02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:50.870
We were a lot of good stuff on there.
Good fitness stuff.

2578
02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:55.370
Do you hear of storm troopers?
Do you actually think of like bad ass?
Yeah,

2579
02:39:56.170 --> 02:39:58.910
cause I always think of them as just things that get shot all up.

2580
02:39:59.230 --> 02:40:03.230
And that is true.
That is true.
But humans,
yeah,
there are people,

2581
02:40:03.350 --> 02:40:07.570
they're troopers actually,
I think they're clones of people.
So this,

2582
02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:09.440
that's why they're just fodder.

2583
02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:13.160
They just get killed by laser beams all the time in the movie.
Yes,

2584
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:16.470
but when you see a storm trooper kettle bell,
it's pretty cool.

2585
02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:20.490
And there's a Darth Vader one too.
There's an iron man one and there's a,

2586
02:40:20.491 --> 02:40:23.940
the Boba Fett guy wouldn't jangle fed or both of them,
I don't know.

2587
02:40:23.970 --> 02:40:28.320
They wear the same helmet.
So nonetheless related there.

2588
02:40:28.410 --> 02:40:31.500
One is where the Clune came from.
If I'm not mistaken,

2589
02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:36.960
I don't know.
I might've got my star wars mythology mixed up,

2590
02:40:36.961 --> 02:40:41.160
but nonetheless they are kettle bells now on.
It makes them end their dope.

2591
02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:44.520
A lot of cool stuff on there.
On it Dotcom.
Slash Jocko.

2592
02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:49.580
We got Mickey in the dragons book that's available right now for every kid that

2593
02:40:50.431 --> 02:40:54.690
you know,
get a Mike in the dragons way the warrior kid

2594
02:40:56.910 --> 02:40:59.760
and weigh the warrior kid to Mark's mission.

2595
02:41:00.300 --> 02:41:03.420
Those are books to show your kid how to be on the path.

2596
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:08.990
And now we have combing warrior kid three which now has a sub title and the

2597
02:41:10.081 --> 02:41:12.900
subtitle is where there's a will.

2598
02:41:14.670 --> 02:41:17.840
So he has to dig deep in this book learns a little bit about digging deep.

2599
02:41:17.841 --> 02:41:20.880
He also learns a little bit about humility.

2600
02:41:21.390 --> 02:41:25.200
He learns about ego for the first time.
His Ego starts getting involved.

2601
02:41:25.290 --> 02:41:30.290
So check out those books that I will let you know when where your kid three is

2602
02:41:30.361 --> 02:41:32.040
available for preorder,

2603
02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:34.470
which we're going to be a little bit more efficient at this time when we do

2604
02:41:34.471 --> 02:41:37.470
preorders so we don't get into the Mike and the dragon situation where people

2605
02:41:37.471 --> 02:41:40.320
have to wait a little extra time to get the book when it comes out.

2606
02:41:40.321 --> 02:41:43.560
So book for you,
I'll let you know when that's ready.

2607
02:41:44.310 --> 02:41:48.090
The field manual discipline equals freedom field manual available right now.

2608
02:41:48.270 --> 02:41:53.100
I was with a buddy of mine that's a in the finance world and has,

2609
02:41:53.130 --> 02:41:54.450
you know,
one of those,

2610
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:59.220
I guess it'd be a stereotypical office of the finance,

2611
02:41:59.221 --> 02:42:01.180
the investment bankers,
you know,

2612
02:42:01.181 --> 02:42:04.950
I'm talking about everything's all clean and white,
New York City type thing.

2613
02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:10.820
And he showed me a picture in there as you walk in this beautiful clean office

2614
02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:17.150
entryway.
It's not even an office.
It's like a thing for Yay.
Yeah,

2615
02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:20.430
yeah.
One of those.
And there's a white table.
It is a big white table.
You know,

2616
02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:22.650
it was probably eight by eight.

2617
02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:27.480
There's one book by itself,
the field manual,

2618
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:31.890
and he says,
and he says his,
his uh,
front office girl the other day,
said,

2619
02:42:31.891 --> 02:42:35.250
everyone that comes in looks at that book and says,
what is this?

2620
02:42:35.251 --> 02:42:37.620
Where does come from?
Where did you get this?

2621
02:42:37.890 --> 02:42:41.850
Every single person who makes a comment.
So that's the field manual.

2622
02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:43.500
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

2623
02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:48.560
Get it for anyone that needs to little help being on the path and you who needs

2624
02:42:48.901 --> 02:42:53.400
helping on the path.
Everybody.
Extreme ownership.

2625
02:42:53.401 --> 02:42:57.420
First Book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin leadership lessons from the

2626
02:42:57.421 --> 02:43:01.620
battlefield.
And then we wrote the dichotomy of leadership,

2627
02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:06.740
which gives some guidance on how to be more balanced as a leader.

2628
02:43:08.731 --> 02:43:12.010
Because if you get out of balance as a leader and you extreme in one

2629
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:15.910
<v 0>direction or the other in a multitude of various dichotomies,</v>

2630
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:20.770
you will rip your team apart,
which is not good.

2631
02:43:20.771 --> 02:43:24.010
So dichotomy of leadership.
Get that one.
We also got Ashkelon Front,

2632
02:43:24.011 --> 02:43:27.070
which is our leadership consultancy.

2633
02:43:27.071 --> 02:43:30.610
And that's what we do is we solve problems through leadership.
It's me.

2634
02:43:30.670 --> 02:43:34.900
It's Leif Babin JP to now Dave Berg,
Flynn Cochran,
Mike's Rally,
Mike by Ima,

2635
02:43:34.930 --> 02:43:39.250
go to echelon front.com.
If you want us to come and work with your company,

2636
02:43:40.030 --> 02:43:45.030
get your leadership aligned and get your entire organization on the path to

2637
02:43:45.371 --> 02:43:48.820
victory.
Hit us up.
We have the muster,

2638
02:43:48.821 --> 02:43:50.380
which is our leadership event,

2639
02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:54.490
2019 we're doing it May 23rd and 24th in Chicago.

2640
02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:56.680
Wouldn't do in September 19th and 20th in Denver.

2641
02:43:56.681 --> 02:43:59.500
And we're doing December 4th and fifth in Sydney,
Australia.

2642
02:43:59.501 --> 02:44:03.640
Are you going to Australia with us?
Yes.
Okay.
So that's what's happening.

2643
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:08.650
Every event that we've done has sold out.
And when I say sold out,

2644
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:12.880
I mean were personal friends of mine are saying,
hey,
hey,
it's a little late,

2645
02:44:12.881 --> 02:44:16.100
but can you just,
ah,
just I just need three seats and you know,
from me.
And uh,

2646
02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:20.560
my girlfriend and my buddy were going to go and I'm like,
actually,
no,
I can't,

2647
02:44:21.010 --> 02:44:25.060
there's no more seats and the fire code will not allow any more human beings in

2648
02:44:25.061 --> 02:44:28.660
there.
So these all are going to sell out.
There'll be no

2649
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:35.990
alibis sick like well in the military told safe rounds or alibis meaning like I

2650
02:44:35.991 --> 02:44:39.970
got an extra round.
Hey just one,
one more like no,
it's not going to happen.

2651
02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:44.650
So,
and don't get mad if that does happen.
You know,

2652
02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:46.840
Oh joke was you know,

2653
02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:52.160
can help you.
Uh,
we have to talk to the fire Marshalls.

2654
02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:58.810
So if you want to come sign up early extreme ownership.com I'll tell you what

2655
02:44:58.811 --> 02:45:00.280
the Australia one is going to be,

2656
02:45:00.570 --> 02:45:04.240
it's going to sell out quick because I think there's 450 seats.

2657
02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:05.410
That is not a lot.

2658
02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:09.820
And when I did a book signing up in Brizzy of in Brisbane,

2659
02:45:09.821 --> 02:45:11.350
Australia,
Brisbane,

2660
02:45:12.130 --> 02:45:17.030
there was a ton of people there that flew to Brisbane to,

2661
02:45:17.090 --> 02:45:20.500
to hang out for five minutes,
you know,
get a book signed.

2662
02:45:20.590 --> 02:45:24.370
So that one in Sydney is going to be sold out quick.

2663
02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:28.570
So jump on there if you want to come down,
