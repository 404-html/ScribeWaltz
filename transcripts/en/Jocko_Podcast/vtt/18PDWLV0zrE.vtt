00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.490
This is Jocko podcast number 56 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.730
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo,
good evening,

3
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.940
silent screams and broken dreams.

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.890
Addicts,
junkies,
pushers and feens.

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.700
Crowded spaces and sad faces.

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.120
Never looked back as the police chase us.

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
Consumed slowly by chaos,
a victim of the streets,

8
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.830
hungry for knowledge,

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.390
but afraid to eat a life of destruction.

10
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.310
It seems no one cares.

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.210
A man child alone with burdens to bear

12
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.260
trapped in a life of crime and hate.

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.740
It seems the ghetto will be my fate if I had just one wish,

14
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.400
it would surely be that God would send angels to set me free.

15
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.620
Free from the madness of a city running wild,

16
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.820
free from the life of a ghetto child.

17
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.230
And that is a poem written by a young Deon,

18
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:27.630
dre McCullough,

19
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.250
a criminal drug dealer who when he wrote that Poe poem was doing time

20
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.170
after being one of the main subjects in a book called the corner,

21
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.850
which is written by David Simon and Edward Burns,

22
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:52.200
which documents the violent drug trade in Baltimore,

23
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.063
Maryland.

24
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.210
And that Sorta morphed into an HBO series that was called the corner as well,

25
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.610
which paved the way for another series,
which is called the wire,

26
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.650
which is just an outstanding mini series that came out on Hbo.

27
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.170
But the wire is his fictional,

28
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:18.090
even though it's based on kind of the same situation in Baltimore,

29
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.250
but the corners real,
the book,

30
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:25.251
the corner is real and it gives a very clear any very grim view at the life of

31
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.660
drugs and crime in the inner city,

32
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.940
namely in Baltimore.
And I'm going to go back to the book now.

33
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.730
We can't stop it.
Not with all the lawyers,

34
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.620
guns and money in this world,

35
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.310
not with guilt or morality or righteous indignation,

36
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.750
not with crime summits or task forces or committees,

37
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.920
not with policy decisions made in places that can't be seen from the last corner

38
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.330
of Fayette and Monroe.

39
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.760
No lasting victory in the war on drugs can be bought by doubling the number of

40
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.850
beat cops or tripling the number of prison beds.

41
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.450
No peace can come from kingpin statutes and civil civil forfeiture laws and

42
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.330
warrantless searches and whatever the hell else is about to be tossed into neck

43
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.050
next year's crime bill down on fifth street.

44
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.520
They know today and has on every other day.

45
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.900
The shop will be open by mid morning and the touts will be on the corners,

46
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.990
chirping out product names as if the stuff is street legal.

47
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.180
The runners will bring a little more of the package down in the feens will queue

48
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:42.730
up to be served align of gaunt,

49
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.350
passive supplicants stretching down the alley and around the block.

50
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.060
The corner is rooted in human desire,

51
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.630
crude and certain and immediate.

52
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.530
And the hard truth is that all the law enforcement in the world can't mess with

53
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:06.541
desire down at Fayette and Monroe and every corner like it in Baltimore,

54
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.270
the dealers and feeds have one because they aren't legion.

55
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.690
They've won because the state of Maryland and the federal government have in

56
00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:19.691
prison thousands and arrested tens of thousands and put maybe 100,000 on parole

57
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.751
and probation roles and still it isn't close to enough by raw demographics.

58
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:31.270
The men and women of the corners can claim victory in Baltimore alone.

59
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.450
A city of fewer than 700,000 souls with some of the highest recorded rates of

60
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:39.490
intravenous drug use in the nation.

61
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.300
They are 50 perhaps 60,000 strong.

62
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.460
Three of them available for every prison bed in the entire state of Maryland.

63
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.070
The slingers,
our manning,

64
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.940
more than hundred open air corners serving up the product as fast as they can

65
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:59.941
get it off the southbound metro liner and the Feans are chasing down that blast.

66
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.920
24 seven

67
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.520
in neighborhoods with where no other wealth exists.

68
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.840
They've constructed an economic engine so powerful that they'll readily

69
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:15.210
sacrifice everything to it.

70
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.680
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

71
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.970
<v 0>and make no mistake,
that engine is humming.
No slacking profit margins,</v>

72
00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:24.060
no recessions,
no bad quarterly reports,
no layoffs,

73
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.700
no naturalized unemployment rate.

74
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.340
Get it straight.

75
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.490
They're not just out here to sling and shoot drugs in drug market and s in

76
00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:39.681
cities across the nation lives without any obvious justification are given

77
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:43.560
definition through a simple self sustaining capitalism.

78
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.600
The corner has a place for them.
Every last soul touts,

79
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.680
runners look outs,
mules,
stick up,
boys,

80
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.440
stash dealers and forcers,
feens burn artists,
police,

81
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:01.790
snitches,
all necessary in the world of the corner.

82
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.290
Each is to be used,
abused,

83
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.120
and ultimately devoured with unfailing precision.

84
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.770
It's about the feens thousands of them who want that good dope.

85
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.430
They need it the way other souls need to breathe air.

86
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.260
It's about the slingers,
the young crews working the packages,

87
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.180
all of them willing to trade a morality that they've never seen or felt for a

88
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.910
fleeting moment of material success.

89
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.730
They're working the package with the hidden knowledge that they will fall,

90
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.410
that with rare exception,

91
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.620
the money won't last and the ride will be over in six months or four or three.

92
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.750
Violence.

93
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.550
Violence is no longer the prerogative of the professional,

94
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.250
but a function of impulse and emotion.

95
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.270
The contract killers and the well-planned assassinations of earlier areas are

96
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.560
mere myth on these corners.

97
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.390
Now the moment of truth generally comes down to some man child with hurt

98
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:21.391
feelings waving of 380 or a 38 around spraying bullets up and down the block.

99
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.370
The accidental shooting of by standards is now common place.

100
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>

101
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.170
<v 0>Even 15 year old hoppers have loaded 38 it's hidden in the alley.</v>

102
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.690
The job is a little better than a deaf

103
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.613
<v 2>wish,</v>

104
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.800
<v 0>and in the end,
the corner best serves the hardcore,</v>

105
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.653
the hardcore,

106
00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.390
the junk yard dogs with neither the time nor the inclination for pity.

107
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.220
The corner proves itself every day.

108
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.510
It destroys whatever it touches.

109
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.433
<v 2>Okay?</v>

110
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.540
<v 0>Eventually the corner destroyed de Andre Mccullough,</v>

111
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.120
even though he received the second chance in his life,

112
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.630
and he actually got to play a small role in that series that came out on Hbo.

113
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:36.650
The wire,
you've got some other jobs in the entertainment industry as well,

114
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:38.360
but the corner called them back.

115
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.130
And that guy,
the Andre who wrote that poem,

116
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.490
he ended up dead of a heroin overdose in 2012 at the age of 35

117
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.200
no,
there's a reason I'm bringing this up and that is because we have a guest

118
00:08:58.201 --> 00:08:59.034
tonight,

119
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.080
a guest that is actually more responsible for this podcast than anyone,

120
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.370
and we'll get to that later.

121
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.060
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

122
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.060
<v 0>but his name is Peter Attia and he grew up a boxer.</v>

123
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:18.740
It's been a long distance endurance athlete,
God,

124
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.750
his degree in medical engineering and applied mathematics and then got his

125
00:09:24.081 --> 00:09:26.420
doctorate as an MD from Stanford

126
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.240
and did his residency in surgery.

127
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.150
And the reason that I started off this whole

128
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.040
talk about the corner is because he did that residency at a place called job

129
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.210
John Hopkins Hospital,

130
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.910
which is about three miles from the actual corner of Fayette and Monroe Street,

131
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.220
the war zone that's pictured in the book,

132
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:02.030
the place where de Andre Macola lived and were violence was and in many ways

133
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:08.090
still is just a part of life and Peter was at ground zero in the war zone and

134
00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:15.680
saw more darkness and suffering probably than any person should have to

135
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.010
and learned a lot from it

136
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.990
and we're going to get to that in a bit,
but first of all,

137
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.810
Peter Attia,
welcome to the show.
Thank you for having me,
sir.

138
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:35.480
Glad to have you on finally
and

139
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.340
you grew up.
We'll get,
we'll get right into it.
You grew up.

140
00:10:40.341 --> 00:10:41.900
Tell us a little bit about just growing up,

141
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.790
you grew up in Canada and I know you've covered it.

142
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:47.750
For those of you that haven't listened to the Tim Ferriss has interview with
you,

143
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.620
listen to them,
what does that,
three of them?
Yeah,
I think so.

144
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:54.860
I think there's three of them.
You can listen to those and get more details on,

145
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.530
you know,
Peter,
his whole background.

146
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.000
But for those that are just listening right now,
you grew up in Canada.

147
00:11:02.001 --> 00:11:04.550
Just a little,
little s little statement about that.

148
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.280
<v 3>Yeah,
I grew up in Toronto.
Um,
you know,
immigrant parents,</v>

149
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.020
so grew up,
you know,
sort of in the wonderful lower middle class,

150
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.570
uh,
not the best suburb of Toronto.
The Toronto,
like New York has five boroughs,

151
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.730
four of them are nice.
One of them is not.

152
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.320
I grew up in the one that's not so nice.
Um,
and uh,

153
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.360
meaning it's just a dump and nodded like it's,
you know,

154
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.640
it's not like a war zone or anything.
Um,

155
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.740
and I have lived now in the United States for about half of my life.
So I,

156
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.410
high school in college was in Canada.

157
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.090
And then everything from med school beyond has been here and I am now a dual

158
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.953
citizen.

159
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.050
<v 0>How did that transition work?
Cause you didn't you,</v>

160
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:51.051
you obviously got applied mathematics degree and then you worked in the civilian

161
00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:54.190
world a little while with that degree,
right?

162
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.690
<v 3>Yeah.
So,
uh,</v>

163
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.420
my plan was always to do a phd in aerospace engineering.
Um,

164
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.810
and so I,
that's why I did the mechanical engineering and applied math.

165
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.180
I did the two things for Undergrad.
Got It.

166
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.660
And then was sort of just in the,

167
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.350
almost about ready to go and start that phd in aerospace.

168
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.650
And then I had just a complete change of heart and decided I wanted to go into

169
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:20.710
medicine.
And so that,

170
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:24.430
so what I had to do for a year then was you've got to take this thing called the

171
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.940
MCAT,
which of course I didn't have any of the courses to take it.

172
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:32.500
So I had to sort of teach myself the chemistry and biology that summer took the

173
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:35.450
m cat.
Okay.
But then I still had times,
that's what I do in the summertime.
It's,

174
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.250
I'll,
I'll teach myself,
you know,
chemistry and biology.
I didn't,

175
00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:42.290
I didn't do that well.
And then,
uh,

176
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:47.030
and then I had to do what's called a post back here where you go back and you're

177
00:12:47.031 --> 00:12:50.390
in the process of applying to medical school without actually having the courses

178
00:12:50.391 --> 00:12:54.260
to get in.
So if you get in it's conditional.
And,
and so that year,

179
00:12:54.261 --> 00:12:59.120
because I'd already graduated,
I just taught calculus.
Um,
so I,
you know,

180
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.440
was like a,
you know,
adjunct lecturer at the university and taught calculus,

181
00:13:03.441 --> 00:13:04.730
which I always enjoy it.
I mean,

182
00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:08.390
cause I taught it for a couple of years before and so and so that's why you're

183
00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:11.800
waiting to get into med school applying and then,
and getting my courses,

184
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:15.850
like I forget what I had to take biology and psychology.

185
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:19.150
Biochemistry had to take a few prerequisites to get it because in engineering

186
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:22.180
and math I'd never taken a single course.
In fact,

187
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.910
the day before I took the MCAT,
this,

188
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:27.690
this is only going to be funny for Geeks who get biology.

189
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.970
So I'll clarify in a moment.

190
00:13:28.971 --> 00:13:33.971
But I'm studying for the MCAT this summer that I'm supposed to take the test and

191
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.040
the whole time I'm studying,
I'm like,
you know,

192
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.320
I can't believe how sloppy these textbooks are.

193
00:13:39.321 --> 00:13:42.530
They keep confusing meiosis and mitosis.

194
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.830
Like why can't they just spell it the same way?
Both times?
Like they,

195
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.440
I didn't realize that it was two separate things.
Right.

196
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.960
My ocs is when a cell separates,

197
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:55.610
Brits doesn't replicate its DNA might host sees is when it creates an equal
copy.

198
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.750
And I literally not until the day before the m cat realized that those were two

199
00:13:59.751 --> 00:14:02.000
separate things.
I mean,
that's how,

200
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.150
that's how clueless I was going into this test.

201
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.630
It was lucky reason I knew that was because I was helping one of my daughters

202
00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:10.580
studied for their biology something.

203
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.310
Anybody who took any biology course should know that,

204
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.140
but I hadn't taken any so and so then you get into med school.
Yeah.
You go there.

205
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.270
What's that?
Four years.
Another four years of school.
Huh.

206
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.360
And then you get done with that and now it's time to do your residency.

207
00:14:23.361 --> 00:14:28.040
So you do,
you get to pick where you're going to go.
Not sort of,

208
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:33.070
so it's a funny system called the match system.
So when you're in your,

209
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.790
that's your beginning,
your fourth year of medical school.

210
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.640
By that point you have to figure it out.
What you want to do.

211
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.280
Do you want to be a surgeon?
Do you want to be an internist?

212
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.870
You want to be a pediatrician or radiologist,
whatever you want to do.

213
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:51.871
Cause all of those have different programs and then you have to apply to those

214
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:55.820
programs.
So let's say you wanted to do orthopedic surgery,

215
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.390
you would send out your application to all the orthopedic programs in the

216
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:03.110
country.
Hopefully you'd get interviews to a good number of them.

217
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:08.110
You'd go do the interviews and then you would submit to a match system,

218
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.320
a rank order of the places you'd want to go.

219
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.070
And you don't put something on there that you don't want to take.
So if you,

220
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:18.860
if you inner,
you know,
if you applied to 30 programs,

221
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:23.630
you got interviewed at 15 and you liked the 10 you rank those 10 in order.

222
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.280
Similarly,
the programs,
after they interview everybody do the same exercise.

223
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.230
They do the rank.
Hmm.
And then a computer matches you one-to-one.

224
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.390
That's actually pretty squared away.
Yeah.
So you,

225
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.160
the only way you're going to guarantee you know where you're going is rank one

226
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:44.570
program and hope you get it.
All right.
So,
um,
in my case,
I forgot,

227
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:49.220
I think I ranked five programs,
um,

228
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.540
and I ranked,
um,
Johns Hopkins first for surgery,

229
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.100
not because I want it to live in Baltimore though in many ways I think it was a

230
00:15:58.101 --> 00:16:02.840
blessing to do so.
But you know,
because at the time,

231
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:04.130
I don't know that this is true today,

232
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:07.010
but at the time it was probably the best general surgery training program in the

233
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:10.370
country.
And that was a combination of two things.

234
00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:15.371
One is you had these kind of legendary surgeons there that had pioneered some of

235
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:19.820
the most complicated,
what are called hepatic biliary surgeries,
surgeons,

236
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.720
surgery of the pancreas and the liver and stuff like that.
But at the same time,

237
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.460
as you alluded to,
it was in a war zone.

238
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.480
And so the other aspect of training to be a good surgeon is having great

239
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:32.600
exposure to penetrating trauma.
So trauma,

240
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.220
you always want to divide into blunt and penetrating blunt trauma is not often

241
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.450
operative.
So people that get hit by cars and things like that,
you know,

242
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:42.830
ends up being more orthopedic.

243
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:45.590
But if you're a general surgeon and you need to be able to cut open the chest

244
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:48.980
and the abdomen and things like that,
it's penetrating trauma.
It's,
it's,

245
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.610
you want knife and gun fight.
Um,
not that you want it,
but that's,

246
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.210
that's the training ground to be.
And so,
and,
and Sorta Baltimore would have been,

247
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.030
you know,
probably in the top five.
What year was this?

248
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:05.220
2000 2001.
Yeah,
2003.
Okay.
And

249
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.290
<v 4>when you were,
what was it,
what was the thing that slipped,</v>

250
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.180
or if this is going backwards a little bit,

251
00:17:12.181 --> 00:17:14.310
what was the thing that transitioned in your mind where you all of a sudden

252
00:17:14.311 --> 00:17:15.144
wanting to do medicine?

253
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.380
<v 3>Well,
yeah,
it's funny.
I don't think I've ever talked about this publicly.
Um,</v>

254
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.420
so when I was in engineering school,
I,
uh,
in my second year,

255
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.060
I started doing some volunteer work.
Um,

256
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.670
and I this the reason why is too complicated,
but I started volunteering with,

257
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.430
uh,
some kids that were in,
in a,
in a shelter that had been abused.
So is,

258
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.540
it is a home for sexually abused kids.

259
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.600
And that got me interested in sort of volunteering in a hospital.

260
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:49.320
So I was volunteering at a hospital that,
um,

261
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.720
had,
you know,
it was a pediatric cancer ward,
so you would just sort of,
you know,

262
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:57.150
you'd go up there and you'd kind of hang out with kids and just play with them

263
00:17:57.151 --> 00:18:00.120
and stuff like that.
And so between that experience,

264
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.960
and then I was still doing this volunteer work with these kids who had been

265
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:05.970
sexually abused.
A lot of those kids were suicidal.

266
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.160
So I also found myself in the hospital a lot with these kids after they'd

267
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.440
attempted to kill themselves.

268
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.510
And I think somewhere in my senior year of engineering,

269
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:19.950
I kind of had this,
you know,
I,
I don't know what the word is.
You know,

270
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:23.100
I don't think it's an existential crisis as much as maybe a nervous breakdown,

271
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:23.940
but just a bunch of things.

272
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:27.990
We're kind of going on probably some undiagnosed psychiatric issues on my part.

273
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:29.760
But I realized like

274
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.950
I love engineering and math intellectually,
but I,

275
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.300
there's no emotional connection outside of the joy of solving a problem,

276
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:41.610
which by the way is probably plenty enough.

277
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.870
But I wondered if there was something else that I'd be more interested in that

278
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:50.850
could scratch two itches,
right?
It could scratch sort of the intellectual itch,

279
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.530
but also maybe an emotional itch.

280
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.560
And so I spent the majority of my senior year thinking about was there something

281
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:02.540
else I ought to do?
Um,
but I'd been successful in,

282
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.220
in my undergrad.
So it was sort of a given that,
you know,

283
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:06.870
if you're going to graduate at the top of your class,

284
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:10.770
you're going to go off and do the best phd program.
So at the very end,

285
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:15.660
when I sort of declined to do that and I turned down a bunch of scholarships,
um,

286
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.380
it seemed a little odd that I would go and do medicine.
But,

287
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.160
but that's really the reason.
It was,
you know,

288
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.350
it was kind of this epiphany I had one day actually while I was in the hospital

289
00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:27.360
and I was sort of had this actually,
it's really funny,

290
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:29.730
we've just moved as were talking about earlier and you know,

291
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.710
one of the things moving is great for is cleaning up stuff and actually found my

292
00:19:34.711 --> 00:19:38.970
essay that I wrote when I applied to medical school back in,
you know,
whatever,

293
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:41.850
95 or 96.
And uh,

294
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.730
it was really interesting to go back and read the story because it's exactly

295
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:46.140
kind of how I remembered it.
Right.

296
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:48.390
Which was like this moment I had this sort of insight,

297
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:53.370
that is what I want it to do.
So,
um,
so that's,
that's kind of the,
the,
the,

298
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:58.371
the series of events that led me to have that seemingly orthogonal change in

299
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:00.680
direction.
Right.

300
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.450
<v 5>Okay.
So now you go through that,
you end up,
you get your excepted,</v>

301
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.140
the residency at John John Hopkins,
you show up there.
What's that like?

302
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:11.963
Well,

303
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.910
<v 3>I remember when I interviewed at Hopkins for Medical School as well.
Um,
and I,</v>

304
00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:20.160
I was lucky enough to get in there for medical school and at the time I think

305
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:22.770
Hopkins was technically the best medical school in the country.

306
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:27.510
I think it was Harvard and Hopkins were the best two.
And Stanford was,
you know,

307
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.920
maybe third,
fourth,
fifth.

308
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.490
But I remember when I interviewed there for medical school at the end of the

309
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:36.420
interview,
like I had to spend a night there.

310
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.720
And so they put us up in the dorms for the Med students,

311
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:42.270
which great idea you get to meet your upper classmates.

312
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.940
And I remember I said that that Friday night I said,
hey,

313
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:46.410
I'm going to go walk down to the harbor.

314
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.560
It's like a mile and a half down the road.
And they were like,
oh no,

315
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.860
you can't do that.
I said,
what do you mean?
He said,
you,
you,
you,

316
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.930
you can't walk outside of the hospital.

317
00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.010
And then they pointed out that on every corner there was like a booth with an

318
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:04.060
armed guard.
There's a garden full armor with a,
an automatic weapon.

319
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.300
And so I remember at the time thinking,
yeah,

320
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.730
I probably don't want to go here for med school.
So,

321
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:13.270
and of course Stanford's sort of for a guy who'd never been to California and

322
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:16.540
who'd lived in miserable cold weather his whole life,
I was like,

323
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.560
it could have been the hundredth ranked medical school.
I was still going there.

324
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.550
<v 5>So I have some actual stats that I pulled up.</v>

325
00:21:23.551 --> 00:21:28.551
So war zone in 1993 there was 48 murders for every hundred thousand people.

326
00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:32.220
There's what?
700,000 in the,
in the city.

327
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:37.460
The next highest was in 2015 55 and in 1993 again there was 353 homicides,

328
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:46.350
homicides,
almost one a day.
And so,
you know,
I have to put this in there,

329
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.350
just,
you know,
because we're sitting here calling it a war zone.

330
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.620
So when I was in Ramadi in 2006 the one one AED,

331
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.100
which is the,
the ready First Brigade,
you know,
5,600 soldiers,

332
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:04.140
while we were there with them for six months,
they lost 61 guys.

333
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.560
So what I'm saying is now that doesn't count the enemy casualties,

334
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.920
but it counts the friendly casualties that are showing up at our med center.

335
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.600
Right.
So there,
you know,
you're talking three or 400,

336
00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:22.620
well you just said one a day.
Yeah,
about one a day.
Okay.
So,

337
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.650
um,
so you knew how bad it was when you got weed?

338
00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.240
<v 3>Yeah,
I sort of knew it was dangerous,
but,
but I think when I decided that,</v>

339
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.060
you know,
for this,
that season of my life,

340
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.060
you got to sacrifice everything and you'd have to go to the place where you're

341
00:22:39.061 --> 00:22:40.050
going to get the best training.

342
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.840
And I didn't want to leave California because you know,

343
00:22:42.841 --> 00:22:46.690
four years in California for the first time was,
you know,
when,
you know,

344
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:48.240
you guys know what it's like.
Yeah.
I mean,
it was like,

345
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.800
I don't ever want to leave this place,

346
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.450
but I also knew I just couldn't get that level of training on the west coast and

347
00:22:54.451 --> 00:22:57.120
it was,
you know,
you basically have to go to a place like Hopkins,

348
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.040
Brigham and women's in Boston,

349
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:04.320
maybe wash u in St Louis was going to offer a very similar environment.
Um,

350
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.150
so then,
you know,
so then I ended up ranking at first they ranked me first.

351
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.590
So away we go,
we get lucky.

352
00:23:10.591 --> 00:23:14.010
It's a match made in heaven and that's like kind of February of your senior year

353
00:23:14.011 --> 00:23:15.210
and then reality sets in,

354
00:23:15.211 --> 00:23:18.330
which is you've got sort of four months until you have to show up.

355
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.880
And that was kind of like the Oh shit moment,
right?

356
00:23:23.881 --> 00:23:27.270
Like the,
I really just signed up for this.
Um,

357
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.590
and a good friend of mine who was two years ahead of me in medical school,

358
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.170
his name is Bryan Dunham.
He's now a pediatric head and neck,
ear,

359
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:41.100
nose and throat surgeon at chop in Philadelphia.
He was at Hopkins,

360
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.250
which was at the time the best ear,
nose and throat program in the country.

361
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.470
And he actually recommended,
I read this book,
the corner because,

362
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:51.980
and Brian's one of these guys who's just,
you know,
he's just,

363
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:54.640
he's like a renaissance man,
you know,
like not only is a great surgeon,

364
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.920
he's like a gifted artists,
you know,
his side job as medical illustration,

365
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:03.380
like you can't believe what this guy can do,
but he's introspective.
Right?

366
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:05.560
And he was,
he said,
look,
you know,
you're,

367
00:24:05.561 --> 00:24:09.320
you're going to sign up to be in this war zone and you're going to be taking

368
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:13.880
care of people that it's going to be very easy to despise.

369
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.501
So he said,

370
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:20.501
you need to read this book to gain a sense of their perspective.

371
00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.920
Um,
because a very,
like I said,
you know,
so,
so at the time,

372
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:27.770
I can't remember the stats.
I feel like at the time that I was there,

373
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.460
we averaged about 16 penetrating trauma's a day.

374
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.670
Now to put that in perspective,
in general surgery,

375
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.360
your on call every second to every fourth night.

376
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.220
So average about every third.
I mean it's every third night,
120 times a year.

377
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:45.590
You will spend the night in the hospital not sleeping,

378
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.740
waiting to take care of any trauma patient.

379
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.160
So if every third day and night,
you know,

380
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:54.110
16 of these people are getting shot and stabbed,

381
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.160
you're going to have a lot of time in the Er in the trauma bay dealing with that

382
00:24:58.161 --> 00:25:00.500
and it's really easy to get jaded really quickly.

383
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.730
It's fun for the first month and then all of a sudden every time somebody gets

384
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:06.320
shot it's preventing you from sleeping,

385
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:10.910
which when we're sitting here all well rested sounds like a very callous thing

386
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:15.200
to say,
but all of a sudden you're sort of like,
dammit man,

387
00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:18.920
like I can't eat because the trauma pager just went off again.
To this day,

388
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:23.900
I still eat shockingly fast and it drives my wife nuts,

389
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.980
but she doesn't understand.
I said,
I think it's just I'm a victim of,

390
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.060
you never know when you're going to have to stop what you're doing and that

391
00:25:32.061 --> 00:25:33.170
might be your last meal.

392
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.260
Even I shaved quickly because the worst thing that could happen is you got

393
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:38.780
shaving cream all over and the trauma pager goes off and you've got to run down

394
00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:41.380
half shaved,
you know,
you got one side of your beard down the other side,

395
00:25:41.381 --> 00:25:46.230
not so stupid things like that.
So,
so that was Brian's recommendation.

396
00:25:46.231 --> 00:25:49.010
So I got the book immediately devoured it,

397
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:55.050
found it to be the most depressing thing I had ever read heavy,
um,

398
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.970
made more depressing by the fact that they pull no punches,

399
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.600
no names are changed.
So every person you read about,

400
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:06.650
you were reading about it in a completely uncentered,
uncensored,
unfiltered way.

401
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.820
And I mean you,
you read it,
you know,
there's nothing happy about this book.

402
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:13.220
Like you just finish it and you think,
yes,

403
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:15.650
you have more empathy than you understand where,

404
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.280
where these folks are going to be coming from.
But it's like,
I don't,
there's,

405
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.470
it's not like you finished that book and go,
Oh,
here's the solution.

406
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.090
We need a six point plan that's going to do excellent.
It's like,
I don't know.

407
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.130
<v 4>That's kind of why I read that one excerpt.
This is like we can't win,</v>

408
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.850
which is an awful fault.
And that's what,

409
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.600
that's the impression the book gives you is we can't win it.
And I don't,

410
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.250
I that the,
the way he phrases it of being licked,

411
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.310
it doesn't matter how many police and whatever you do,
you're,

412
00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:44.130
you're going against desire.

413
00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.860
<v 3>Well,
the,
the stat that you reiterated,</v>

414
00:26:46.861 --> 00:26:51.270
and I remember it very well from when I read this book the first time was you

415
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:53.910
couldn't take every junkie and put them away.

416
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.780
If you took every federal and state prison bed in Maryland,

417
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.700
you'd have three people for it.
If you just looked at the users,

418
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.900
never mind the guns,
the money and everything that comes with it.

419
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.240
So yeah,
that's not a solution.

420
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.080
Now there's a second reason that I don't think Brian knew,

421
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:17.710
cause I don't think anybody knew that that book really hit home.
Which,
um,

422
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.630
was it,
it,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it sounds tangential to this story,

423
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:25.890
but it becomes highly related.
And at the beginning of a

424
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.670
end of my third year of medical school,

425
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.890
I'm going to the gym one day riding my bike as I always do.
I get up,

426
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.960
I get to the gym,
I get off my bike,
go to lock it up.
And I was like,

427
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.120
my back really hurts,
like really hurt.
Not like,
oh,
it's a little stiff.

428
00:27:42.121 --> 00:27:43.890
Like something feels horrible.

429
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.570
So I started walking down the steps to the gym and I was like,

430
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.060
not gonna happen today.
Like,
I mean,
I couldn't,
I couldn't do anything.

431
00:27:53.061 --> 00:27:57.450
I couldn't tie my shoe.
So I just went back,
got on my bike,
rode,

432
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.080
rode back to my apartment,
told my roommate.
I was like,
Hey man,

433
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:05.280
I'm gonna gonna go lay a bit light down upstairs.
The next morning I woke up,

434
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:09.420
I couldn't get out of bed.
And to make a very long story short,

435
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.860
over the next two weeks,
I completely deteriorated.
Um,
you know,

436
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.280
I was at the point where I could get in and go to the hospital,

437
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:19.470
but I had to like have the nurses,

438
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:21.960
this is back in the wild west days where you could just sort of get anything you

439
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:23.370
needed at the pharmacy.
You know,

440
00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:26.190
I'd get nurses or residents to inject toward all into me,

441
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.930
which is a really strong end.
Said,

442
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.620
I could only sleep if I laid in an l shape over the nurses' station.

443
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.810
Um,
and it just wasn't getting any better.

444
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:40.680
And then one day it pain changed immediately.

445
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.330
I realized in retrospect what happened,

446
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.320
a herniated disc had fragment had broken off.
So the pain in my back dissipated.

447
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:47.880
But now I had this,

448
00:28:47.881 --> 00:28:51.870
what turned out to be a four centimeter fragments sitting on my s one nerve
root.

449
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.140
So now it felt like my left foot was being skinned from the bottle,

450
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:57.450
but that was constant.

451
00:28:57.451 --> 00:29:02.451
So that was an unrelenting pain and it could only be sort of brought under

452
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.430
control if I could put my foot into a bag of ice,

453
00:29:05.431 --> 00:29:08.640
cause then I could make my foot go numb and then I could take some pain
medicine.

454
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.030
So this went on for another week and then the dean of the medical school saw me

455
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:13.590
limping through the hospital.
I said,
what's wrong?

456
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:15.960
And I told him and he dragged me down to the Er.

457
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:19.950
We got an MRI that showed all of this.
And I was in surgery the next morning.
Uh,

458
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.900
this was a Sunday night.
Monday morning,
I'm in the,
or it turned into a disaster.

459
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.340
The Guy who operated on me operate on the wrong side.
So I woke up,

460
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.620
the left issue was still present,

461
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.140
but now I had what's called a foot drop on the right side.

462
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.970
So foot drop is when the nerve that holds your foot up,

463
00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:40.830
which we take for granted when we walk.

464
00:29:40.831 --> 00:29:44.620
But if you don't have the ability to what's called Dorsi flex,

465
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.020
your foot would drop.
You can't walk,

466
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:51.550
you'll end up dragging your toe when you keep tripping.
This story,
I mean,

467
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:53.980
we could spend three hours on the story because it's so idiotic.

468
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.240
The punchline is I eventually needed many trips back to the operating room.

469
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:02.020
This guy refused to believe there's anything wrong with me.

470
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:06.880
It took another amazing doctor,
a neurologist,
to actually intervene on my behalf.

471
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:12.160
And three months later,
I'm unable to walk.

472
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:13.270
I'm unable to do anything.

473
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:17.530
My mom actually had to fly down from Toronto to look after me.
Um,

474
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.200
and I'm sort of,
you know,
you go through the checklist,
right?
So,

475
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:27.220
so there's,
I don't know if you've ever heard of Elizabeth Kubler Ross.

476
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.570
I don't think she's alive anymore,

477
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:33.571
but she wrote a very famous book on the stages of dying and it goes through like

478
00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:41.230
anger and denial and finally acceptance at the end.
Right.
And so,
you know,

479
00:30:41.231 --> 00:30:43.630
bargaining like it's something that would make sense if you,

480
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:47.980
and I'm sure you've watched and you've probably watched it on really small

481
00:30:47.981 --> 00:30:49.090
scales,
you know,

482
00:30:49.091 --> 00:30:53.860
like in combat you might see these things over the course of compressed with a

483
00:30:53.861 --> 00:30:56.170
cancer patient,
you might see this stretched out over a year.

484
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.600
And so I was kind of going through this on my own right,

485
00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:00.850
where initially it was like,
oh my God,

486
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.790
what if I don't finish this rotation I'm doing right now what's called a

487
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:08.710
surgical sub internship too.
Oh,
well what if I don't graduate on time too?

488
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.090
What if I can't be a surgeon?
And then it was,
what if I don't walk ever again?

489
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.620
Um,
so somewhere along the way,

490
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.090
and I don't remember exactly when,

491
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.990
probably like a month and a half into this,

492
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.410
I finally caved in and started taking pain medicine.

493
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.400
<v 4>I thought that's where the story was going.
I was like,</v>

494
00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:32.610
at some point he's going to get on the opiates.
Yep.

495
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:38.440
<v 3>Been so reluctant to do so initially been so stoic,</v>

496
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:43.240
you know,
just taking my end ceds and I'm even using Benadryl,

497
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:45.160
which is a horrible pain medication of course,

498
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:47.410
but it sedates you through some of the pain.

499
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.560
And so I,
you know,

500
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.070
I started taking Percocet and Percocet is um,

501
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.550
it's typically 10 milligrams of oxycodone.

502
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:02.790
Oxycodone is the fast acting version and it's stronger than say a vix or Vicodin

503
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.040
is Tylenol and hydrocodone immediate acting.

504
00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:09.820
But hydrocodone is not as strong as oxycodone.
Percocet is stronger than Vicodin.

505
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:14.890
They both have Tylenol.
It's just the opiod is stronger.
And so,

506
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.370
you know,
if you take a Percocet,
which would,

507
00:32:17.371 --> 00:32:21.700
we have 500 milligrams of Tylenol and 10 milligrams of Oxycodone,
you know,

508
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.470
I probably was taking,
you know,
start taking two,
three,
four,

509
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:27.430
five,
six of those a day,

510
00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:32.431
you develop a tolerance and eventually you,

511
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.040
there's a longer acting version called Oxycontin,

512
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:39.980
which is just a time released version of oxycodone.
So

513
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.480
<v 6>then you would take that twice a day.</v>

514
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:46.481
So at my peak I was probably taking 80 milligrams of oxycontin a day,

515
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:50.090
plus another hundred and 20 milligrams of oxycodone.

516
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.870
I just got rid of the Tylenol all together.
You can just get straight oxycodone.

517
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:59.350
And so I'm about 200 milligrams a day of oxycodone equivalent.

518
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.150
And again,
if you know,
if I took that today,

519
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:04.490
I would just die because you just stop breathing.
But at the time,
you know,

520
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:07.760
you build up this tolerance.
But it also,

521
00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:12.761
there was this point where I realized that I wasn't just taking it for the

522
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:14.690
physical pain.
Right.

523
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:18.710
And I think this is the single most important insight I had that when coupled

524
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:21.290
with reading that book six months later was the,

525
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:25.580
I think the single most important realization I ever had with respect to,

526
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.600
to this problem,
which was at some point it was,

527
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:33.980
I was just so depressed that I couldn't walk and I was so worried that I'd never

528
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:38.210
be able to do anything again.
That at least the drug gave me a high.

529
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.620
That took me away from that.

530
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.940
And so then it got to the point where I was just taking that drug all the time

531
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:49.340
and I just stopped engaging,
like wasn't engaged with anyone,
anything.
Um,

532
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.720
and then I sort of had this realization that that was happening and I was like,

533
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.430
I,
I want to stop.

534
00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:00.740
So at the time I was dating this girl,
she was an anesthesiology residents.

535
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.940
She was a few years older than me,
re just the coolest,
coolest person.

536
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.231
And I'd said to her,

537
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:09.380
she was kind of the only one that knew what was going on because at the time,

538
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:11.210
even the doctors who are prescribing this,

539
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:14.390
like this just wasn't on people's radar as a problem back then.

540
00:34:14.391 --> 00:34:17.280
I think today people would be like,
homeboy,

541
00:34:17.281 --> 00:34:20.480
he's got 200 milligrams of Oxycontin a day.
That's probably not good.

542
00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:22.810
But at the time it was just like,
it was like tic tacs.

543
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.640
<v 4>That's right.
So that would legitimately kill it.
Like if I took 200 milligrams,</v>

544
00:34:26.641 --> 00:34:28.890
would that,
that would really Jackson went up,

545
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.620
<v 6>I would think.
I think if I took 200 today,
I would stop breathing.
Yeah.</v>

546
00:34:32.621 --> 00:34:36.670
Cause that's how opiates kill you.
They repress,
they inhibit respiratory drive.

547
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.070
That's what,
whenever,
whenever someone overdoses on heroin,

548
00:34:39.071 --> 00:34:43.660
they just stopped breathing.
Um,
so yeah,
I think 200 would,

549
00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.510
I don't know.
We'd have to,
I'd have to look at the farm right after.

550
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.540
Um,
she,
she said,

551
00:34:52.541 --> 00:34:54.760
you can't just stop right?
You,

552
00:34:54.761 --> 00:34:59.761
the withdrawal is so painful that you have to taper off.

553
00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:04.360
You have to probably go on Methadone and then you'd have to start some pretty

554
00:35:04.361 --> 00:35:09.040
potent antidepressants like Maoi or Tca.

555
00:35:09.041 --> 00:35:11.370
So you have to go on a drug like nor triptolene,

556
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.040
which is in and of itself kind of a crazy thing.
And I was like,

557
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.870
yeah,
but I think I'm just going to stop cold Turkey now,
unlike alcohol.

558
00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.340
So if you took an alcoholic,
you know,

559
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.030
you took someone who is drinking 20 alcohol,

560
00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.500
alcoholic beverages a day and they've been doing that forever and you stop them,

561
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.573
they will die.

562
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.780
They will get something called Delirium tremens and they will die a horrible

563
00:35:34.781 --> 00:35:38.010
cardiac death.
They will break into a arrhythmias.
They will die.
So

564
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.120
<v 3>when we had alcoholics in the hospital,</v>

565
00:35:40.121 --> 00:35:42.660
and let's say we had to operate on somebody who happened to be an alcoholic,

566
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.270
we would actually just put them on an ethanol eat.

567
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.550
We weren't even trying to detox them.

568
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.480
We just want to make sure they didn't die and go into these delirium tremens
but,

569
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.790
but heroin and opiod is not like that.

570
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.320
It is not physiologically lethal to stop cold Turkey.

571
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:03.240
It's just unbearable.
And so I was like,
I'm going to do it.

572
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.260
So against her better judgement,

573
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.360
I just stopped one day and she could not have been more.

574
00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:16.230
Right.
It was the darkest,
I mean,

575
00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:20.340
I can laugh about it now.
It was the darkest month of my life.
It was a month.
Oh,

576
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:23.790
at least.
I mean it was,

577
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:27.390
I would just sit on a park bench for the whole afternoon,

578
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.600
like complete flat affect.

579
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.640
<v 5>But it's all mental.
It's not a physical thing.
No,
there's physical stuff.
Yeah.</v>

580
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.610
<v 3>Going on.
I mean,
but,
but no,
it's,
it's,
yeah,
you're,
you know,
you,</v>

581
00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:42.910
you sort of like,
you know,
opiates make you itch like crazy.
You get constipated.

582
00:36:42.911 --> 00:36:45.040
So there's like a reversal of a whole bunch of physical stuff.

583
00:36:45.041 --> 00:36:49.180
But the biggest thing is the craving and the depression.

584
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:55.030
Um,
and so the depression of coming off this thing was brutal.
Um,

585
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.240
in many ways.
And I don't tell that story to say,

586
00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.080
well look at how special I am that I detox.
That's not the point at all.

587
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.070
I had two things going for me that virtually no junkie has going for them.
Right?

588
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.120
The first is I didn't have a network of people around me that were doing the

589
00:37:10.121 --> 00:37:12.280
same thing.
So I was sort of the only guy doing it.

590
00:37:12.281 --> 00:37:16.060
So for me to go and be around my friends was to be around people who weren't

591
00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:16.894
doing this.

592
00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:20.620
We always used to joke that if you really want to kick a heroin habit,

593
00:37:20.621 --> 00:37:22.480
you have to get a whole bunch of new friends like you.

594
00:37:22.481 --> 00:37:24.910
You don't get to decide you're not doing heroin and then go back and hang with

595
00:37:24.911 --> 00:37:27.460
your friends that are doing hair when you need to watch trainspotting to learn

596
00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:29.380
that.
The second thing,

597
00:37:29.381 --> 00:37:33.100
and perhaps the more important thing is I finally did connect with a doctor who

598
00:37:33.101 --> 00:37:34.790
was able to put me on the right path.
So I,

599
00:37:34.791 --> 00:37:39.580
I had ended up going back to the operating room probably half a dozen times over

600
00:37:39.581 --> 00:37:44.350
the course of the year to have all these problems corrected and then I found

601
00:37:44.351 --> 00:37:48.100
something else to fix it on,
which was physical therapy.
So I started to,
you know,

602
00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.280
even though it didn't seem like exercise,
it wouldn't seem like exercise today.

603
00:37:51.281 --> 00:37:54.610
At the time it was the first activity I was able to do.
And so,
you know,

604
00:37:54.611 --> 00:37:59.080
within six months I could like walk like a reasonable distance again.

605
00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.830
And so I would be spending three hours a day at physical therapy just doing like

606
00:38:02.831 --> 00:38:04.480
the most trivial exercises.

607
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.890
But basically the root cause of my depression was getting better.

608
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.250
So that's really the only reason I think I was able to kind of detox off this

609
00:38:12.251 --> 00:38:15.520
stuff.
Whereas I think for many people,
a,

610
00:38:15.521 --> 00:38:19.150
it's not clear what the root causes or B,
it's not getting better if it is clear.

611
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:23.170
And so that's why I think it's really,
it's a,
it's a brutal addiction.

612
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.470
<v 5>And it seems like also you had a future,
right?
You had a life,</v>

613
00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:29.090
you are in medical school,
you're going to,
you know,

614
00:38:29.091 --> 00:38:33.340
you're going to ask a lot of these people that are drug addicts,
what do they,

615
00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.970
they have no life that they're looking forward.

616
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.220
They're just looking forward to nothing.

617
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.110
<v 3>And so in February of that senior year,</v>

618
00:38:39.111 --> 00:38:43.490
when I had to submit my rank list,
I think we match in March,

619
00:38:43.491 --> 00:38:48.110
I misspoke earlier.
I was still not functional perfectly.

620
00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:53.140
Like there was no way in February of 2001 that I could have withstood a surgical

621
00:38:53.421 --> 00:38:57.080
residency,
but I had to make a decision at that point,
which was,

622
00:38:57.081 --> 00:39:00.740
will I be ready on July 1st and if I won't be,

623
00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:03.680
I should not submit my rank.
I should defer a year,

624
00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.510
sit out a year in medical school,
whatever.

625
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.720
And I remember that was the hardest decision I had to make and I just gambled.

626
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:09.531
I was like,
you know what,

627
00:39:09.531 --> 00:39:12.230
I'm going to be ready and I'm going to make it happen no matter what.

628
00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:17.000
And so I submitted matched and then in addition to now reading the corner to

629
00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:22.001
prepare for Baltimore and reflecting on my own sort of struggled with addiction,

630
00:39:22.491 --> 00:39:26.120
which was completely fresh in my mind.
I'm also like rehabbing,

631
00:39:26.121 --> 00:39:30.410
like it's my day job and going through like as an eye.

632
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.870
Most people take the last quarter in med school off,

633
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:35.390
but I didn't have the ability to do that now because I had the,

634
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.260
I had to go straight through till graduation day because I'd missed so much time

635
00:39:39.261 --> 00:39:41.210
during my injury.
Um,

636
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:46.810
so when I showed up in Baltimore a couple of days before July 1st I mean it

637
00:39:46.971 --> 00:39:49.780
still wasn't crystal clear to me that I could go,
you know,

638
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:54.560
two days without sleeping,
standing in Orr for eight hours at a time.

639
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.060
All those sorts of things.

640
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.640
<v 5>Yeah,
no,
that's one of the things,
the sleep deprivation,
cause people always,</v>

641
00:39:59.641 --> 00:40:04.641
obviously I take a lot of flack because I don't sleep a lot and,

642
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.370
and the sleep deprivation.
So what did that low,

643
00:40:08.371 --> 00:40:10.710
what's that like when you're going through residency and you're just saying,

644
00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:14.250
I mean there's days where you're going 24,
48 hours,
no sleep.

645
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:19.050
And how'd that affect you?
What did you think of that?
What do you think?

646
00:40:19.051 --> 00:40:20.040
Looking back at it,

647
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.920
<v 3>w w what's your opinion of it now?
Well,
you know,</v>

648
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:28.270
when I decided that I was going to go into surgery,
I mean I,
I always,

649
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.640
I'm pretty,
uh,
insecure in general.

650
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.830
Most people don't necessarily appreciate that on the outside,

651
00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:37.090
but always thinking,
I don't know if I've got what it takes here,

652
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:38.690
how do I figure it out?
And so my,

653
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:42.640
my whole emo in life is test the system hard.

654
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:47.170
So when I was in medical school still deciding this,
I figured,
well,

655
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.630
every Thursday night I'm going to pull an all nighter in my room,
standing up,

656
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.430
not allow myself to eat,
sleep,
drink,
pee,
do anything.

657
00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:01.950
And I'm a stand at my desk for eight hours and practice suturing,
you know,

658
00:41:01.951 --> 00:41:05.020
sort of try to mimic what it would be like to be in an operating room all night,

659
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:08.030
not being able to go pee and not being able to drink,
not going to do this thing.

660
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:12.460
And so I had a little bit of confidence,
you know,
I figured,
okay,
I can do this.

661
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.220
Like I can pull an all nighter once a week.
That's,
you know,

662
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.250
not that that's a good thing to do,
but it was like kind of a confidence thing.

663
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.840
Right.
So then you show up,

664
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.850
but there's no preparing you for what you're in store for.

665
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.070
Now I got to point out this is not the way it is anymore.
So in 2000,

666
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.140
I want to say like four,
um,

667
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.690
<v 6>like labor laws came in exactly the,</v>

668
00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.590
a whole bunch of laws came in that we could spend hours talking about how it

669
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:43.100
turns out the laws haven't,
they haven't fixed the underlying root problem,

670
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:46.910
but nevertheless,
a whole bunch of work requirement hours stuff got fixed.
Right.

671
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:50.360
So you couldn't work more than 80 hours in a week or 88,

672
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:54.530
depending on if your program had an exemption and you couldn't work more than 24

673
00:41:54.531 --> 00:41:56.600
hours consecutively and stuff like that.

674
00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:01.600
But by the time those laws really kicked in,
I was already gone.
And,

675
00:42:01.601 --> 00:42:06.140
and so I don't really know what it's like today,

676
00:42:06.141 --> 00:42:08.630
but I would imagine it's,
um,

677
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.440
it's less demanding from a sleep deprivation standpoint.

678
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.980
But at the time there were no such rules and you were at the sort of every

679
00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:20.810
second,
every third or every fourth night call.

680
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:24.710
But then your post call day you would still work.
So our mutual friend,

681
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:26.690
Kirk Parsley,
which of course is how we met,

682
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:31.900
this is one of his favorite stories about me because he loves this story because

683
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:34.340
it's so crazy.

684
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:39.230
So this is July of 2001.

685
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.290
So I am one month into being a doc,
right?

686
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:47.600
And I'm on an every third night call rotation at this hospital called Bayview,

687
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:52.520
which is about five miles from what we call the mothership,
which is Hopkins.

688
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.960
And it's out in like East Baltimore.
It's in a real crappy part of town.

689
00:42:56.961 --> 00:42:59.500
Not that there's,
isn't really,
I mean,
I hate saying this,
but I don't,

690
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:03.650
they're not that many good parts of town,
at least back then in Baltimore.
Um,

691
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.820
and uh,
so I'm a,

692
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.490
so I show up on a Monday at five o'clock in the morning.

693
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.950
So I slept in my own bed Sunday night.

694
00:43:12.951 --> 00:43:15.140
So Monday morning I show up at five to round,

695
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:20.141
we do our whole thing and that night I'm supposed to go home.

696
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.800
So that's my off,
cause you called your swing day,
you show up at five,

697
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.610
you'll be home by 7:00 PM that night.
If all goes well.
So you worked your,

698
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:28.821
you know,

699
00:43:28.821 --> 00:43:32.300
14 hours and then you sleep in your own bed and then you get to come back the

700
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.760
next day and then you're going to be on call.
So at the,

701
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.530
so we're rounding that afternoon.
So,
and the,
uh,
the,

702
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.690
the s one of the senior resident says,
Hey,

703
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:44.490
so and so didn't show up for their shift in the Er.

704
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:49.460
The Er always staffs one surgical resident fulltime and this guy just didn't

705
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:54.140
show up.
And she's like,
and it's a 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM shift,

706
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.440
can you cover it?
And you know,

707
00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:02.240
this would be like if you ask the most junior guy you know to do something like

708
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:07.100
he,
he,
he'd be kicking his own ass to say yes.
Like he couldn't wait to do that.

709
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.190
Right.
So I was like,
hell yes,
I will do that.

710
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.790
So then I go down to the Er and I work all night,

711
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:17.360
seven to seven and then the next morning is now my on call day.

712
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:22.690
So now I'm 7:00 AM cranking away until that night.

713
00:44:22.851 --> 00:44:26.240
And then I'm up all night on call.
So,

714
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:32.130
and then it's now Wednesday and it's my post call day and I'm there till

715
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:37.370
five or 6:00 PM so I've basically been up from about 4:00 AM Monday and it's now

716
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:39.930
five or 6:00 PM Wednesday

717
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:45.450
and I get in my car to drive home and I have to make it,

718
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.480
I have to go down this miserable street called Eastern Avenue to hit the 83 to

719
00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:55.800
drive up to my place.
And I'm driving along eastern avenue,

720
00:44:55.801 --> 00:45:00.360
which is like red light after red light after red light or stop sign or
whatever.

721
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:04.080
And every time I'm at a stoplight,
I fall asleep,

722
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:08.850
my foot pops off the clutch and I stall.
Like I am so tired,

723
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.290
I can't even,
you know,
handle like the gradual,
you know,

724
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.770
easing off the clutch and the gas just to move up and up and up.
I can't do it.

725
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.290
So finally,
in one moment of lucid clarity,
I'm like,
you can't get on the freeway,

726
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.490
you're going to die.
So I was like,
what's the solution?
I was like,

727
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:27.870
you gotta get over and take a nap.

728
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:32.910
So I pull over my car on the side of eastern avenue right in front of this park

729
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.520
called Patterson Park,
which at the time,

730
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.350
I don't think I fully understood that that was an open air drug traffic market.

731
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.370
So I got up,
but here's the best part of,
sorry,

732
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.240
the logical thing to do would have been just in,

733
00:45:45.241 --> 00:45:48.600
stayed in the car and take a nap.
But I was like,
yeah,

734
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:51.540
I haven't seen the sunlight in like days.
And it's,
the sun is still out.

735
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:55.860
Like I'm going to go nap in the park.
So I get out of the park,

736
00:45:55.861 --> 00:46:00.861
I'm in green scrubs that are covered in bloodstains cause I was too dumb to not

737
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:03.630
change.
I go lay down in the park,

738
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:08.870
I take my page or off and I clip it to my neck and I set the alarm to let go off

739
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:10.320
in one hour,
you know,

740
00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:13.890
so at like 7:00 PM it'll wake me up and I'll feel perfectly rested and I'll be

741
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:14.724
able to drive home.

742
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.560
So I laid down and middle of Patterson Park and the next thing I know I wake up,

743
00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:22.140
it's like one in the morning,
two in the morning,

744
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.090
there's needles everywhere there is,

745
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.690
I have like a bite on my arm that looked like they're from rats cause they're

746
00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.160
like nothing I've ever seen before.

747
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:35.580
Like these bites all over me and I'm just thinking to myself like,

748
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.560
how did I not get killed here?

749
00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.780
Like the only thing that prevented me from dying was how ridiculous the site
was.

750
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:47.220
You know,
if something's so strange,
like nothing,
you know,
so I was like,

751
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:48.330
God damn it man.

752
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.930
So I get back in my car and drove home and when I tell Parsi that story,

753
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:53.010
he loves it because he's like,

754
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:57.930
that's the classic example of how complete deprivation of sleep impairs your

755
00:46:57.931 --> 00:47:00.840
judgment.
Um,
so you know,

756
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.750
there were a couple stories in residency where I had to do like those three

757
00:47:03.751 --> 00:47:06.940
night back to back to backs.
Another time it happened,
I remember was an okay.

758
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.820
<v 5>Do you feel like though,
okay,
driving a car is kind of boring stop lights,</v>

759
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:13.470
but when you're really tired,

760
00:47:13.471 --> 00:47:15.330
but then all of a sudden something happens like boom.

761
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.480
I feel like when that happens,
I feel I can lock on it.

762
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:22.170
There's almost no amount of sleep deprivation that will stop me from functioning

763
00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:24.780
and getting something done that's important all on task on time.

764
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.510
<v 6>Absolutely.
Is that true?
Does that true?
No,
I think,</v>

765
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.520
I think an adrenaline rush in the can provide any amount of clarity and focus

766
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:35.770
that's necessary.
The problem is very few things are life or death that way.

767
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.490
Now in your world,
there were plenty of things,
but in my world not,

768
00:47:38.491 --> 00:47:40.360
and this is the extra.
So sure.
I was going to tell it was

769
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:45.360
in a pretty my third year,
uh,

770
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.380
I think it was my third year.
Um,
I was same,
same sort of deal.

771
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:53.380
I ended up covering for somebody and then covering for two people in two

772
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:54.970
consecutive nights.
And then it was my turn.

773
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:58.870
So that was like three straight nights of not sleeping and it's the middle of

774
00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.880
the night.
And this guy comes in the Er who's,
you know,

775
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.880
got a really diseased gallbladder.

776
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.340
And in retrospect it should've never come out that night.

777
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:10.390
But a lot of times the dirty little secret is surgeons want to operate at night

778
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:11.140
cause they can get better.

779
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.310
Oh our time electively as opposed to waiting the next day if it's not emergent.

780
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:15.881
So sure enough,

781
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:19.600
we're in the middle of the operating room doing a laparoscopic gallbladder

782
00:48:19.601 --> 00:48:23.350
removal at two in the morning when we don't really need to be there two in the

783
00:48:23.351 --> 00:48:26.890
morning.
We could've slept and done it the next day.
Um,

784
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:29.450
and sure enough,
so,

785
00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.560
so in a lab in removing the gallbladder is a two surgeon procedure.

786
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.440
So there's the main surgeon,
which because we're a teaching hospital,

787
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:36.280
I'm the main surgeon,

788
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:39.070
I'm actually doing the operation and then there's the attending who's holding

789
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:42.760
the camera and retracting for me.
So I'm like,
I'm doing this.

790
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.640
And yeah,
that's a stimulating activity.

791
00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:49.180
But of course I've done a hundred of them so it's not that stimulating.
Well,

792
00:48:49.181 --> 00:48:50.470
I can't stay awake.

793
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:54.970
And I finally somehow managed to fall asleep on this patient,

794
00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.810
like I face plant into patient.
Wow.

795
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:03.220
Luckily it was laparoscopic so I didn't contaminate the surgical,
but so

796
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:08.180
<v 4>even something as stimulating as surgery because it would look if the guy's</v>

797
00:49:08.181 --> 00:49:11.330
aorta was bleeding,
I'm sure I would have.
Yeah,
exactly.

798
00:49:11.331 --> 00:49:15.980
But now you're doing this full of copper gallbladders no big thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

799
00:49:15.981 --> 00:49:19.730
It wasn't stimulating enough to overcome three days of sleep debt.
Did you do?

800
00:49:19.731 --> 00:49:23.060
Did you figured out any tricks?
Any,
you know,
for instance,

801
00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.680
I can tell when I was going through seal training and even my,

802
00:49:25.681 --> 00:49:29.060
my whole career and even to this day,
I take these,
I take a little power naps.

803
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:30.590
If I'm feeling that tired,

804
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:35.870
I elevate my feet and I sleep for like six to eight minutes and it totally

805
00:49:35.871 --> 00:49:38.060
recharges me.
Did you,
do you take power naps?

806
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:39.690
<v 6>Okay.</v>

807
00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:42.150
<v 4>No.
Aside from your power nap parking,</v>

808
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:45.580
it lasted seven hours and almost guys you killed.
I did

809
00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:49.170
<v 6>power nap in my car again,
same thing.
I was like,</v>

810
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.160
there's like eight o'clock at night.
I got to the pool.
I had a rule,

811
00:49:53.161 --> 00:49:54.480
which was after you left the hospital,

812
00:49:54.481 --> 00:49:57.660
you never went home because I knew if I went home I wasn't going to leave.

813
00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.160
So I would always go from the hospital to the gym or the pool or whatever I was

814
00:50:02.161 --> 00:50:05.160
doing.
And on this particular night I get there,
it's eight o'clock at night.

815
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:08.490
I am so tired.
I'm nauseous.
Like the thought of that.

816
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.800
<v 4>You didn't want to go home just because you knew you'd go to sleep?</v>

817
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.970
I fall asleep,
I want to go to sleep because you've been awake for three days.

818
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:13.950
Why didn't you warn off?
Why don't,
why don't,

819
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:16.520
why don't you want to go and fall asleep?
The funny,

820
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.280
<v 6>a good friend of mine who again,
a couple of years ahead of me,</v>

821
00:50:19.281 --> 00:50:22.370
gave me interesting advice,
whether it was right or wrong,
I don't know.
He said,

822
00:50:22.371 --> 00:50:25.850
look,
you're going to be tired no matter what in residency.

823
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.100
Don't stop all the other things in your life because you'll still be tired.
Now.

824
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:32.360
I don't know that that was the right advice,

825
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:36.950
but I took it to heart and in my view was I'm going to continue to work out

826
00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:40.820
every day.
I'm not on call,
I'm gonna,
you know,
do all the stuff I want to do.

827
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:44.630
And unfortunately sleep always took the brunt of it.
So yeah,

828
00:50:44.631 --> 00:50:46.910
so it would be to the pool.
And so same thing I got there,

829
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:50.870
but on this particular night I was so tired.
I was so nauseous.

830
00:50:50.871 --> 00:50:54.590
Like I couldn't suppress the desire to vomit.
And I was like,
I'm not gonna.

831
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:56.750
I can't,
if I puke in the pool,
they'll kick me out.

832
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:58.730
I won't get to soon as it's not going to be worth it.
So I was like,

833
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:04.370
just sit here for like 30 minutes and take a quick nap.
So same thing.

834
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.430
Took the page you're out,
which normally could wake me up,
clip it here.

835
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:12.430
And it was freezing because it was like the winter.
So I left.
No,

836
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.040
it wasn't cold,
but I remember wanting to leave the radio on.
I like a dumb ass.

837
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.330
So the car is off.
So alternators off radios on what?

838
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:23.420
You know how the story ends?
I wake up at two in the morning,
battery's dead.

839
00:51:23.421 --> 00:51:25.180
I'm in the middle of the parking lot.
I can't,
you know,

840
00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:29.390
I had to call my girlfriend,
get jumper cables to get me out.

841
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.230
That's a girlfriend went on to become my wife,
by the way.
Um,

842
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:37.280
so short answer,
no,
I didn't have a great strategy.

843
00:51:37.281 --> 00:51:41.270
I did have a friend who,
and I never tried this,

844
00:51:41.271 --> 00:51:44.240
but he told me he would put coffee grounds in his eyelids.

845
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:47.480
Apparently it hurts so much that you couldn't close your eyes.

846
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:51.820
<v 5>Okay.
That's what I mean,
I would not that,</v>

847
00:51:51.821 --> 00:51:54.310
but I've told people this all the time to,
you know,
do,

848
00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:56.650
do a little bit of physical exercise.
If you're super tired,

849
00:51:56.651 --> 00:51:58.570
that definitely picks you back up.

850
00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:03.990
There's gotta be some reality or some scientific reason for that happening is

851
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.380
that's another thing you can do.
But um,
so you were so okay,

852
00:52:08.381 --> 00:52:12.550
we know it's socks.
You're not sleeping and you're dealing with these patients.

853
00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:17.700
And how do you start to detach from this reality that's around you so you're not

854
00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:23.050
getting,
you know,
cause you,
you,
you,

855
00:52:23.051 --> 00:52:26.140
you said already you like to kind of the emotional involvement with people.

856
00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.770
But then at the same time you said it didn't take long before you despise these

857
00:52:29.771 --> 00:52:33.160
patients that are coming in because they're interrupting your sleep and

858
00:52:33.161 --> 00:52:33.994
bothering you.

859
00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:39.190
That's gotta be a crazy balance to try and strike as a human being.
I mean,

860
00:52:39.191 --> 00:52:44.191
human beings are not meant to be dealing with 16 puncture wounds a day.

861
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:49.150
That's,
that's not right.
So what,
what happens in your brain?

862
00:52:49.151 --> 00:52:50.110
What happened in your mind?

863
00:52:50.111 --> 00:52:54.640
What did you notice about your mentality and this whole business as time went
on?

864
00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:59.760
<v 6>Well,
what I noticed,
so again,
not everybody becomes jaded,</v>

865
00:52:59.761 --> 00:53:01.410
but most people do.
And where,

866
00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:04.930
where my sense of jaded developed was actually towards,
you know,

867
00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.080
the patients with diabetes,

868
00:53:07.081 --> 00:53:10.860
the patients who had complications from being overweight.

869
00:53:10.861 --> 00:53:13.290
Like when those people would show up with,
you know,

870
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:16.180
the abscess in their foot in the middle of the night,
that needed to be debris.

871
00:53:16.181 --> 00:53:18.640
Did those people,
I would get,
again,

872
00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:23.470
pretty pissed at amazingly the,

873
00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:25.710
that what we,
you know,
these,
these folks,

874
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:29.400
like I kind of always maintained a soft spot in my heart for them.

875
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:34.670
And interestingly,
you know,
it's,
it's,

876
00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:38.880
it's easy once they die.
Yeah.
So,
so what happens is,
let's say a guy comes in,

877
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:40.680
you guy's been shot.
Um,
you know,

878
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:44.640
generally people who are dead in the field don't make it in.
So,
so,
but,

879
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.070
but sometimes there's this gray zone where,
you know,

880
00:53:47.071 --> 00:53:49.440
someone comes in who's basically dead,

881
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:52.620
but because they had a little bit of a pulse on the way in the door,
like,

882
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:57.180
we're gonna do everything we can.
But a lot of times when those patients die,

883
00:53:57.181 --> 00:54:00.180
like the room has to be turned over really quickly,

884
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:04.110
which means someone's got to come in and take the body,
put it in a body bag,

885
00:54:04.111 --> 00:54:06.600
gather everything.
Cause usually these are criminal investigation.

886
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:07.680
So the police are there,

887
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.130
the housekeeping staff has to come in and mop all the blood off the floor

888
00:54:11.131 --> 00:54:13.740
because depending on where the gunshot wound was,
like gunshot wound to the head,

889
00:54:13.741 --> 00:54:17.520
for example,
tons of blood.
Um,
because the heads of confined space,

890
00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:22.860
um,
and in that moment it's really easy to just immediately walk out the door.

891
00:54:22.861 --> 00:54:26.370
But I find myself,
you know,
I'd,
I'd sometimes like flip through their wallets.

892
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.000
Right.
And you know,

893
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.950
invariably you'd see something like you'd see a picture of a little kid.

894
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:35.730
So you see this guy who's huge,
who's just been killed,

895
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:40.700
he's probably 25 and you'd see like this six year old girl in his wallet and
you,

896
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.470
you know,
you'd start to sort of wonder what the narrative is,
right?

897
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:47.610
Like is that his daughter?
Probably.
Did he know her?

898
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.510
Probably.
Did she know him?
Maybe not.
Like,
you just don't know.

899
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.930
And all of a sudden that that's,
that's,
that's,
that's a sort of humanizes these,

900
00:54:54.931 --> 00:54:56.310
these guys.
And again,

901
00:54:56.311 --> 00:55:00.360
I think because of my own understanding of what they were dealing with because

902
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.700
of those 16 penetrating traumas,

903
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:07.280
15 had to be drug involved in one way or another.
Um,

904
00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:12.390
and so everybody who were taken care of for the most part was some part of the

905
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:16.110
cycle that's being described in the corner.
Now occasionally it wouldn't be,

906
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.630
I mean one of the examples that stands out that was,

907
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:24.120
I would say sort of like the top five saddest things I ever saw in residency was

908
00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:26.880
July 1st,
2002 I just happen to remember that day.

909
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.560
And this girl on her 16th birthday came in and she was just,

910
00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:33.690
she was just hit by a stray bullet in her neighborhood.

911
00:55:33.691 --> 00:55:38.100
It was her 60th birthday stray bullet from,
you know,
unrelated gang violence.

912
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.020
Hit her in the head.
And you know,

913
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.380
she's an example of someone who came in basically dead.

914
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:46.100
But in situations like that,
like you'll,
you know,

915
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:47.160
I'm sure you can relate to this.

916
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:50.040
You're just going to do something that's so beyond heroic.

917
00:55:50.041 --> 00:55:51.930
You want to do anything and everything to try to save her.

918
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:55.830
And of course we couldn't.
So,
you know,
those examples are kind of rare,

919
00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.020
but the majority of the Times it's,
you know,

920
00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:03.150
executions for people who stole money.
Um,
that's,

921
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.970
those,
those would be hard to see.
Right?
Because you see these girls,
you know,

922
00:56:05.971 --> 00:56:07.860
this is like this is a deadly game.

923
00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.820
<v 5>No.
And even the,
even the girl,
the 16 year old girl,</v>

924
00:56:10.821 --> 00:56:14.180
she's part of the cycle too because that's just a stray bullet.
That's right.

925
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.660
<v 6>She's in a,
she's in a lousy neighborhood.
You can almost guarantee that,
you know,</v>

926
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.490
if she's living in where she's living to get hit by a stray bullet,
like,

927
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.470
you know,
yeah.
She wasn't living in,
you know,
Roland Park.

928
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:27.470
<v 4>And when,
once you,
did you,</v>

929
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:30.080
would you ever see any family would have any family ever come in?

930
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:34.900
<v 6>Yeah.
So there's two types of things going on,
right?
So,
so the,</v>

931
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:39.910
the biggest problem we would have would be real gang on gang stuff because it

932
00:56:42.471 --> 00:56:44.300
became sort of a feed forward loop.
Right?

933
00:56:44.301 --> 00:56:46.760
So if one guy came in and he was killed,

934
00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.290
you immediately knew the flood gates were going to open because there's going to

935
00:56:51.291 --> 00:56:54.190
be retaliation that night.
I don't remember.

936
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:59.390
The police were pretty good about trying to make sure that like when someone

937
00:57:01.371 --> 00:57:03.860
came in and who was killed,
like if you weren't immediate family,

938
00:57:03.861 --> 00:57:06.260
you were not allowed there.
Um,

939
00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.870
and they also tried to create a little bit of a delay and letting that

940
00:57:08.871 --> 00:57:12.560
information out.
Again,
maybe that wasn't the,
the,
the,

941
00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:14.150
the most considerate thing to do,

942
00:57:14.151 --> 00:57:19.070
but their view was trying to let the violence dissipate.
Um,
yeah,

943
00:57:19.071 --> 00:57:20.330
the family stuff's hard.
I mean,

944
00:57:20.331 --> 00:57:22.880
the hardest family interaction I ever had was with,
uh,
with,
uh,

945
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.660
actually a blunt trauma and it wasn't involving drugs at all.
Right.
This was,
uh,

946
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:30.980
this was a,
um,
a boy.

947
00:57:30.981 --> 00:57:34.760
He was 15 years old.
He and his brother,

948
00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:38.540
his older brother who was probably 18,
had picked him up after school.

949
00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:42.230
They were driving home and they were,

950
00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:47.180
they had the right away and a guy ran a red light and t-boned them on the

951
00:57:47.181 --> 00:57:50.810
passenger side.
And this,
the 15 year old boy,

952
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.700
both of them came in as separate traumas,

953
00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:57.320
but the older boy came in as an adult trauma.
So he went to the adult side.

954
00:57:57.321 --> 00:57:58.940
I happened to be on pediatric surgery,

955
00:57:58.941 --> 00:58:02.090
like I was the senior resident on pediatric surgery that month.

956
00:58:02.091 --> 00:58:05.480
So I ran a pediatric trauma,
which is where the 15 year old came in.

957
00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:09.440
And that turned out the older,
the driving son was fine.

958
00:58:09.441 --> 00:58:10.670
He didn't have a scratch on his body,

959
00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:15.800
but this kid came in basically dead on arrival though it wasn't clear why,

960
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:19.310
but his pupils were blown.
Um,
you know,

961
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:22.220
little bit of a pulse.
We did,
you know,

962
00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:28.090
probably 30 minutes of everything imaginable before accepting the reality that

963
00:58:28.281 --> 00:58:30.480
he shared his aorta.
So if a,

964
00:58:30.481 --> 00:58:35.010
a high enough force can actually share the aorta and it dissects and you

965
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:39.290
basically bleed to death inside the wall of the aorta.
And that's why he died.

966
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:43.640
And that was another example of how everybody just sort of scatters after that.

967
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:48.440
But you know,
his mom is in a waiting room wondering where her boys are,

968
00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:52.550
who,
you know,
could have been in a fender bender for all she knows.
So

969
00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:55.610
those were,
I mean,

970
00:58:55.611 --> 00:58:59.510
unquestionably the most difficult discussions ever because trauma is the one

971
00:58:59.511 --> 00:59:03.970
area where
there's complete surprise.
Like,
you know,

972
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.990
it's tragic when somebody dies from cancer.

973
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:10.160
It's even tragic when somebody dies during an elective surgical operation,

974
00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.810
which happens unfortunately from time to time.

975
00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:16.160
But at least there you have some heads up that something dangerous is going on.

976
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:19.550
But this kid like,
you know,
said goodbye to his mum that day,

977
00:59:19.551 --> 00:59:22.100
went to school and never came and now she

978
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.250
<v 3>hears,
oh,
he's in a car accident and she's in the hospital.</v>

979
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:27.530
Never imagining that he could be dead.

980
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:31.280
And then you have to be the guy that goes in and say,
you know,

981
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.600
I'm really sorry to tell you this,
but your son is dead.
You know,

982
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:39.620
there's actually a really interesting article written in the New York Times on

983
00:59:39.621 --> 00:59:44.600
this exact topic,
um,
by,
uh,
so it's kind of interesting story.

984
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:46.880
So my mentor in medical school to this day,

985
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:50.210
one of the closest mentors I've ever had is a guy by the name of Steve
Rosenberg.

986
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:55.100
So Steve Rosenberg is the chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute and

987
00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:57.800
he's kind of one of the luminaries in immunotherapy.

988
00:59:57.801 --> 01:00:02.120
So I did my postdoc with him at the Nih and uh,

989
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.360
I actually spent time there in medical school and actually he just called me

990
01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:08.150
yesterday out of the blue.
We ended up having a great catch up for 30 minutes.

991
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:13.010
His daughter,
his three daughters,
his youngest daughter is Naomi Rosenberg,
who's,

992
01:00:13.011 --> 01:00:17.570
uh,
a resident at and I think she's an emergency room doc at Penn,

993
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:22.640
which is also in a war zone in Philly.
And she wrote a great piece on this,

994
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:26.060
which maybe we could link to in the notes or something.
Um,

995
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:31.010
it's probably like the last three months about the difficulty of having to

996
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:34.070
communicate to families when tragedies like this happen,
which of course,

997
01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.170
you know,
she would see a lot of as well in Philly.

998
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:40.030
<v 5>And then that happens.</v>

999
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:45.340
So you do everything you can to save this kid's life.

1000
01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:48.910
And then you walk in,
you face the mother,

1001
01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.360
you drop the most devastating possible imaginable news on her,

1002
01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.530
and you got to go back to work.
I mean,
right.
I mean,
don't you then have to,

1003
01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:03.680
isn't it?
Don't you have to go work again now that,

1004
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:08.530
that night in particular,
that was,
that was,
that was,
um,

1005
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:13.350
<v 3>I remember that day pretty well.
That was April of 2003,
um,</v>

1006
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.790
when that boy died.
And,
um,
but at the time,

1007
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:19.561
you know,

1008
01:01:19.561 --> 01:01:23.430
by the time we had declared time of death and I had gone to talk to his mom,

1009
01:01:23.431 --> 01:01:26.010
it was probably like 10 o'clock at night,
you know,

1010
01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.570
I probably spent an hour with her.

1011
01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.690
And of course it's disruptive because you're in there and your pager is going

1012
01:01:30.691 --> 01:01:30.901
off.

1013
01:01:30.901 --> 01:01:34.380
I've got the Er calling me about this kid and I've got the ICU calling me about

1014
01:01:34.381 --> 01:01:39.270
this and you know,
um,
and she's,
you know,

1015
01:01:39.271 --> 01:01:41.990
I mean,
like I,
I,
God,

1016
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.850
I sure hope I never have to know what she went through because I can't,

1017
01:01:44.851 --> 01:01:47.100
can't really imagine.
Right.
I mean,

1018
01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:52.080
she's hysterical at a level that you just like a movie doesn't do justice to

1019
01:01:52.081 --> 01:01:56.850
that.
Like you don't see that level of hysteria normally.
Um,

1020
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.981
and I,

1021
01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:02.070
I that that was certainly like one of kind of the three or four that really

1022
01:02:02.071 --> 01:02:05.420
upset me the most.
I mean,
I,
I had a real hard time getting,

1023
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.630
I think I got lucky that night.

1024
01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.000
I think that at night ended up being a pretty calm night.

1025
01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:13.320
I remember I got to probably spend some time just alone in a call room that

1026
01:02:13.321 --> 01:02:17.620
evening.
You know?
And,
and for me that was a,
so the,

1027
01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:21.270
this is the awful thing is we tend to project what's going on in our own life,

1028
01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:24.150
into any situation.
I mean,
I,
I think I realized that pretty early.

1029
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.480
And so I think in the case of that particular trauma I saw in that boy,

1030
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:33.000
my brother,
my younger brother.
And so I,

1031
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.610
so I was dealing with two things in that moment.
One was,
um,

1032
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.460
meaning from my own and not,
not,
not the immediate issue,
which is this boy died.

1033
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.330
One is I'm imagining now like this could have been me and my brother in high

1034
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:48.150
school like this.
This could have been us.
And how,

1035
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.860
how your life changes after that.

1036
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:54.080
Like I thought his brother's life is never going to be the same.
Um,

1037
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:55.681
the second was,

1038
01:02:55.681 --> 01:02:59.670
this was already after I had decided to leave medicine altogether.
Um,

1039
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.050
which was in June of 2006 and this,
this trauma,

1040
01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:08.550
it was like April of 2006 so I decided in March of that year that I was just

1041
01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:11.220
going to finish that year and then leave.
So,

1042
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.940
so the other thing that was sort of,
that I was struggling with,

1043
01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:18.330
which probably makes us a little heavier than it needed to be,

1044
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:21.810
was as painful as this is,

1045
01:03:21.811 --> 01:03:23.670
it's a privilege to be this person.

1046
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.060
It's a privilege to be the guy who gets to try to save a life.

1047
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:32.370
And even when you fail that interaction you're going to have with that family,

1048
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:34.680
which I think is something they only wrote about in that piece.

1049
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.000
It's so important.

1050
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:39.150
It seems trivial to us because you have that interaction over and over and over

1051
01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:43.560
again.
But to that family,
it's so important that will be with them forever.

1052
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.810
And I think I felt that,
I felt that that was a privilege.

1053
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:48.060
And so I think I realized like,
I'll never do this again.

1054
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.750
I'll never again have that privilege to,
even if I fail to,

1055
01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:54.630
to try to,
you know,

1056
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:58.740
sort of say to somebody to actually then be able to comfort that family.

1057
01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:02.520
And that sounds really weird and it's a very morose sort of thought to have.

1058
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:06.990
But all of those things,
I think in that particular example,
um,

1059
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:12.240
you know,
made for a really difficult,
uh,
set of,
you know,

1060
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.550
days and weeks that followed.
I went to his funeral,

1061
01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:17.790
his first patient I ever went to a funeral of a first trauma patient,

1062
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.940
certainly went to the funerals of patients.
You've got to know through,
you know,

1063
01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:23.880
people who were dying of cancer and stuff,
but,
you know,
trauma patient,

1064
01:04:23.881 --> 01:04:26.580
like you just wouldn't think to go to someone's funeral that you'd never known

1065
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.890
because like,
I'd never known that boy.
Right.
Um,

1066
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:33.810
I stayed in touch with his mom for a few years and not surprisingly,

1067
01:04:33.811 --> 01:04:36.690
their life just completely fell apart.
You know?

1068
01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.580
<v 5>Does it make it that much worse that you got this?</v>

1069
01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:47.260
You juxtapose the,
the kind of this normal kid,
right?

1070
01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:52.120
Who dies this random accident and then at the same time every night you're,

1071
01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.530
you've got people that are killing each other

1072
01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.330
and you're dealing with and you're seeing the results of that and you can't do

1073
01:04:58.331 --> 01:05:02.700
anything about it.
How does it,
does that also play into your,

1074
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.170
your thoughts about,
hey,

1075
01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.790
I'm here trying to save these people's lives and they're out there killing each

1076
01:05:09.791 --> 01:05:13.450
other for over nothing over the street corner over this,
over that.

1077
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:15.820
Did you go down that road?
Mentally,
I'm

1078
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:17.980
<v 3>not there.
I'll tell you</v>

1079
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.060
<v 6>the one time I felt really ethically,
maybe ethnically is too strong a word,</v>

1080
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:23.410
but just to be blunt,
I mean,

1081
01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:27.400
the one time I was really pissed off that I was trying to save somebody's life

1082
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:32.650
was a guy that came in who killed his wife,

1083
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.750
killed his daughter,

1084
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:40.530
and then put the gun in his under his Chin and pulled the trigger and mist.

1085
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:46.470
So he basically blew off the side of his face and was still alive.

1086
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.610
His brain was completely intact.

1087
01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:53.440
This guy was going to survive after 23 you know,
face operations,

1088
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.720
and you know,

1089
01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:59.380
I'm taking care of this guy in the ICU and I'm kind of pissed off about it

1090
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:03.100
actually,
right?
And maybe I shouldn't be right?
Who am I to judge this guy?

1091
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:05.860
But I'm like,
you know,
you killed your wife,

1092
01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:07.780
you killed your kid and you wanted to die.

1093
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.380
Why the hell am I putting anything into you?
Now,
of course,

1094
01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:14.980
that is a slippery slope because in medicine we're never supposed to play that

1095
01:06:14.981 --> 01:06:19.470
role,
right?
We're never,
we never play God,
right?
People,
you know,

1096
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.300
some doctors want to act like they're playing God,
but we never played God.

1097
01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.930
We're just there to do a job.
And on that day I remember thinking,

1098
01:06:25.931 --> 01:06:27.850
I don't want to do this job.
I don't want to,

1099
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:30.220
I don't want to take care of this guy or I want this guy to die.
Actually.

1100
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.950
<v 5>How do they,
how do they,</v>

1101
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.170
how do they address that when you're going to medical school,

1102
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:38.400
that whole idea they've got a covered on,

1103
01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:43.170
or is it just so underlying that the underlying theme of everything you do that

1104
01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:46.950
by the time you get done it's there?
Well,
that's a,
that's a really good question.

1105
01:06:46.951 --> 01:06:47.784
I don't know.

1106
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.620
Are there ethic ethics classes in medical school that teach you that?

1107
01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:53.610
I am sure who are there.

1108
01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:57.720
<v 6>Are I the fact that I can't tell you one thing about an ethics class I took</v>

1109
01:06:57.721 --> 01:06:58.554
tells you it,

1110
01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.780
that whatever ethics you have are going to be independent of whatever class

1111
01:07:03.781 --> 01:07:06.450
you're taking.
And who knows?
You know,
today,
you know,

1112
01:07:06.451 --> 01:07:10.230
these pendulums swing from one end to the other for all I know,
you know,

1113
01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:13.640
half the curriculum could be ethics today.
I don't know.
But,

1114
01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.870
but the short answer is I think,
you know,
it's,

1115
01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.320
it's sort of internal and the reality of it is,
you know,

1116
01:07:19.321 --> 01:07:21.780
if you're in a good program and the one thing I'll say,
I mean,

1117
01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:26.310
as much as Hopkins was a brutal place to exist,

1118
01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:31.710
the camaraderie there was unbelievable.
I mean,
you know,

1119
01:07:31.711 --> 01:07:35.340
the nickname for the residents was the Halstead marines,
right?
Which again,

1120
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:39.450
it doesn't do justice to real marines,
but that was sort of the camaraderie,

1121
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.090
right?
It was like you would do anything for your rest,
you know,

1122
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.870
that's why you'd always volunteer to stay up three nights to help somebody else

1123
01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:50.340
out.
And so,
you know,
I hadn't really great friends there.
And in fact to this day,

1124
01:07:50.341 --> 01:07:54.540
like some of my closest friends,
people that I'm in touch with almost every day,

1125
01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:57.270
we're were guys I went through that experience with.

1126
01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:01.080
And you could talk about those things with each other,
right?
I mean,
you know,

1127
01:08:01.081 --> 01:08:04.230
it was,
it was okay to say like,

1128
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:08.490
I really wished this mother fucker would die because he's taking up a bed,

1129
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:14.070
he's costing the state 1 million bucks and I hate him.
Um,

1130
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.190
and I think somehow being able to talk about

1131
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.040
<v 3>that,
I think makes it a little bit easier.
Right?</v>

1132
01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:22.300
<v 5>Well,
absolutely.
I mean,
in any,
that's what happens in the military.</v>

1133
01:08:22.301 --> 01:08:26.810
You get guys that go through tough situations,
tough battles,
and they are,

1134
01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:29.170
they become closer going through it.

1135
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.080
And part of the thing that brings them closer together.

1136
01:08:31.081 --> 01:08:33.910
So you're talking about what's going on as it's happening and after it happens.

1137
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:35.463
What did you,

1138
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:38.200
<v 2>so</v>

1139
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.040
<v 5>a lot of times in this,
this podcast,</v>

1140
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:44.550
I say that this podcast,
yeah,

1141
01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:48.630
we talk about war and we talk about leadership and we talk about history,

1142
01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:54.320
but I find that the actual root of what the podcast becomes about is,

1143
01:08:55.830 --> 01:09:00.270
is really about human nature and what people,
what human beings are like.

1144
01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:04.980
Was there,
I'll give you both sides of this question.

1145
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:09.570
Did you learn anything about people,
about human nature there?

1146
01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.960
That was surprisingly positive.

1147
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.420
And before you answer that one,

1148
01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:18.180
did you learn anything about human nature while you were there?

1149
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:21.000
That was surprisingly negative.

1150
01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.330
<v 3>So,
so I'll give you one thing that I learned that I don't know that I would call</v>

1151
01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.410
positive or negative,

1152
01:09:29.411 --> 01:09:34.411
but it was an observation that in retrospect seems obvious but it never would

1153
01:09:36.281 --> 01:09:38.890
have.
I never would thought of it before.

1154
01:09:38.891 --> 01:09:42.650
And to this day it still serves me well to understand it.
So the opposite,

1155
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.210
the fruit does,
the first observation is that,
um,

1156
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:51.750
when you look at a significant illness,
like a,
a,

1157
01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:56.650
a completely disruptive insult,
you know,
cancer,
you know,

1158
01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:58.180
you have pancreatic cancer,

1159
01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:02.360
which means you're going to die and you're going to die soon.
Um,

1160
01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:07.180
there are two types of families that come into that situation.

1161
01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:12.280
So families that show up already fractured,
get blown apart,

1162
01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:17.730
fractures that families that show up already tight become the tightest of any

1163
01:10:18.521 --> 01:10:21.700
family.
The same would be true when you see,
you know,

1164
01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:25.390
a kid that comes in,
you know,
a burn victim,
right?

1165
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:28.720
As kid that gets burned badly on the 4th of July and this kid's going to spend

1166
01:10:28.721 --> 01:10:32.440
the next two months in the hospital.
Um,
you know,

1167
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:35.770
a couple that comes in with tension already in their marriage.

1168
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.170
They get splintered,
wide open.

1169
01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:40.960
If they came in and everything was fine,

1170
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:42.900
they're going to be there for each other,
they're going to be tighter.
So,

1171
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.540
so that was an observation that I just saw over and over and over again.

1172
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:50.290
And I sought in probably even more,
um,

1173
01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:55.000
vivid color when I was at the Nih because the two years I was there,

1174
01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.490
um,
you know,
I was mostly doing research,

1175
01:10:57.491 --> 01:11:00.760
but you still had clinical responsibilities and so you're,

1176
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:04.060
you're basically seeing patients who are coming to receive experimental therapy

1177
01:11:04.061 --> 01:11:06.460
for cancer.
So these are patients who were all,
you know,

1178
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:09.790
otherwise going to die within six months and most of them will still go on to

1179
01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:12.220
die.
Obviously the,
a subset of them we can help,

1180
01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.040
but you're seeing over and over again.

1181
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.390
<v 6>So that was the first observation.</v>

1182
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:20.430
And then the second was that there were just a couple of residents who,

1183
01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.050
um,
I couldn't believe how amazing they could be,

1184
01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.880
how they could never sort of do the wrong thing.

1185
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.970
So,
so there,
there were two residents in particular.
One really,
he was,
he,
he,

1186
01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:38.450
his name is Chris Sonne and day he is now a,
uh,

1187
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.510
he's a transplant surgeon at the University of Michigan.
Amazing guy.

1188
01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:45.600
And so Chris was two years ahead of me and I mean,

1189
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:50.100
he was like that guy that I would have done anything for.

1190
01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:54.900
And I remember when I was leaving thinking to myself,
you know,

1191
01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.530
I'm really glad I'm leaving because if I stayed,

1192
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:02.610
I'd know I could never be as good as Chris like that.
Like,

1193
01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:04.320
how can someone be this good?

1194
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.920
And I don't mean like he can so this good and cut that out.

1195
01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:12.450
I don't mean even medically and human,
just as exactly as a human being.

1196
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.890
He is on a level I can't get to.

1197
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:21.780
And you know,
I don't know anybody else who can get there either,

1198
01:12:21.781 --> 01:12:26.340
but the fact that I can't get there is a little upsetting to me.
Um,

1199
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.160
and I'm glad I don't have to spend the rest of my life chasing him,

1200
01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.390
which of course Chris would never think of it that way because that's the nature

1201
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:36.780
of being that guy as you is just completely humble,
modest,

1202
01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:39.510
unassuming guy who just happens to be a god.

1203
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:44.870
<v 5>You know,
it's,
it's,
uh,
going back to the first point that you mentioned,</v>

1204
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:48.620
and it's something that I've heard people talk about as well,

1205
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:51.360
my buddy's talk about is,
you know,
the,

1206
01:12:51.361 --> 01:12:56.270
the whole idea of post traumatic stress and all that and,

1207
01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.310
and what war does to people,

1208
01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:02.480
and one thing that I happened to agree with is pretty similar to what you're

1209
01:13:02.481 --> 01:13:06.890
saying and that is going into the war,
right?

1210
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:12.070
If the person is got a good stable mindset and a good attitude and is a positive

1211
01:13:14.241 --> 01:13:18.830
person and they're going to come out of it with all those good positive things

1212
01:13:18.831 --> 01:13:21.350
amplified,
they're going to be more positive.
They're going to be stronger,

1213
01:13:21.351 --> 01:13:22.520
they're going to be mentally tougher.

1214
01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:27.500
It's the people that go into it that are already somehow fractured.

1215
01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:32.210
Those fractures are going to get worse through the trauma of combat.
Again,
um,

1216
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:37.310
this is a broad generalization and there's definitely great guys that see things

1217
01:13:37.311 --> 01:13:38.510
or do things that they,

1218
01:13:38.511 --> 01:13:41.150
that it hurts them and it takes them a while to get through it.

1219
01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.150
But there's also some guys that you go,
you know,

1220
01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.720
that guy was messed up when we showed up and now he's worse and it,

1221
01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.410
and it's that pressure that opens up those fractures even wider.

1222
01:13:51.411 --> 01:13:52.830
And it's interesting that you got this,

1223
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:56.660
you saw that with family structures as well.

1224
01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.720
And I could completely see how that happens.
And that happens,
right?

1225
01:13:59.721 --> 01:14:02.180
That happens in it.
You don't even need trauma to make that happen.
I mean,

1226
01:14:02.181 --> 01:14:05.660
when you get the financial trauma on a family,
if they're not tight,
that'll,

1227
01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:08.480
that'll make him blow up.
Whereas if they're tight,

1228
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:12.610
you don't going through some financial problems,
they'll get,
they'll buckle down,

1229
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.490
they'll save money together,
they'll skip the movies,
they'll start,
you know,

1230
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:19.780
they'll enjoy cooking ramen noodles together so that trauma can,

1231
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.510
can expose those fractures.

1232
01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:27.660
That's why it's important to try and create the most solid foundation you can

1233
01:14:28.481 --> 01:14:31.240
with your family and with your own mind.
So that when these traumas hit,

1234
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:34.510
you don't get fractures screen for that.

1235
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:40.300
They try to,
but um,
you'll like this story.

1236
01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:43.510
So we had to take a psychological screening.
This isn't the 90,

1237
01:14:43.511 --> 01:14:47.440
so it wasn't like we were super advanced on any of this stuff.
And I'm going,

1238
01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.180
you know,
when I was going through bootcamp,

1239
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.660
they gave us a psychological screening for,

1240
01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:55.450
for our attempt to go to,
to seal training.

1241
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.350
And so they asked a bunch of questions and it was complete the sentence

1242
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:03.850
questions.
And so it would,
it was really obvious what would,

1243
01:15:03.851 --> 01:15:08.380
what would flag you and for,
and,
and so I made every answer,

1244
01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.930
uh,
cause we,
I was in boot camp and the food sucked.

1245
01:15:10.931 --> 01:15:15.640
And so every answer that I gave was just all about food.
So for instance,
they'd,

1246
01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:20.020
they'd say,
complete this sentence.
I hate when my mother,
right.

1247
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.140
So it's pretty easy to,
to say,
you know,

1248
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.220
I hate when my mother shuns me in front of my sisters and I want to kill her.
No,

1249
01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:29.740
no,
no,
no,
no.
All my answers were like,
you know,

1250
01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:34.770
I hate when my mother overcooks the steak and doesn't put enough pepper on it.

1251
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:40.150
You know,
just like every answer I gave was about food,
but it was really easy.

1252
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:43.660
My point is that it was really obvious if you were not a complete,

1253
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.570
even if you were,
if you,
in fact,
if you were a psychopath,

1254
01:15:46.571 --> 01:15:50.200
you would very easily say,
answer all the questions correctly and get through it.

1255
01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:53.230
And there's been plenty of guys that made it through seal training that,

1256
01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:55.540
you know,
there's,
there's some bad criminals,
there's a,

1257
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.950
there's been a couple really heinous crimes committed by guys that were seals

1258
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:04.930
and just,
just if they made it through,
they got screened.
So yeah,
they,

1259
01:16:04.931 --> 01:16:06.940
they had a screening,
but I wouldn't say it's the most effective.

1260
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:08.680
They've gotten better now,
you know,

1261
01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:11.740
in some of those guys that committed horrible crimes,
it,
you know,

1262
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:15.820
kind of inspired the seal teams to step up that screening process as much as

1263
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:18.850
possible to make sure that we're not letting guys through that or that are

1264
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.050
deranged some way that are going to do something horrible like that.

1265
01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:28.880
Um,
you kind of already talked about these,

1266
01:16:28.881 --> 01:16:33.710
but is there any other thing that,
that you learned about yourself

1267
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:39.180
in that situation and,
and you,
I didn't really know too much about the,
uh,

1268
01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.530
where you went afterwards that the NIH,
if you want to go into that a little bit,

1269
01:16:43.531 --> 01:16:46.170
but what did you learn about yourself through this whole process?

1270
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:49.140
Obviously you learned something because at some point you decided,
you know what,

1271
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:51.450
I don't want to,
I don't want to do this.

1272
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.290
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean that's,
those are,</v>

1273
01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:58.650
those are some of the most interesting years of my life and I,

1274
01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:04.220
I'm pretty glad that I didn't have my first kid til I was 35 which on the one

1275
01:17:04.321 --> 01:17:07.290
hand you,
you sort of think,
well,
God,
I'm so old,
you know,
like,

1276
01:17:07.291 --> 01:17:09.980
I'm not going to be,
I'm not going be like the 50

1277
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.420
<v 6>year old grandfather.
Right.
Um,
but on the other hand,</v>

1278
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:17.060
I think it's a really good thing because when I think about what was going on in

1279
01:17:17.061 --> 01:17:20.360
my mid to late twenties,
you know,
the,

1280
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.450
the sort of really difficult decisions I had to make.
I mean,

1281
01:17:23.451 --> 01:17:27.620
leaving medicine after being in it for 10 years was a really difficult decision,

1282
01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:30.890
especially to go and do something that had nothing to do with medicine.
I mean,

1283
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:34.250
when I left,
I joined a consulting firm,
Mckinsey and Company,

1284
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:39.080
and I did credit risk modeling.
Like I didn't have a thing.

1285
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:42.640
The fact that I was a doctor was like a liability.
There was no,
like,

1286
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:45.740
it was like starting all over again in life.
Um,

1287
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:48.380
so to get to that point,
yeah,

1288
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:52.460
I had to go through a whole bunch of stuff.
So I think,

1289
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:55.490
I mean,
I don't know,
I wouldn't even know where to begin.
I mean,

1290
01:17:55.491 --> 01:17:59.690
I think one thing I learned was,
so this fellow that I alluded to earlier,

1291
01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:02.840
Steve Rosenberg,
who is again to this day,

1292
01:18:02.841 --> 01:18:07.220
probably one of the most important mentors in my life outside of family members,

1293
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.300
um,
just an amazing human being,
right?

1294
01:18:11.301 --> 01:18:13.400
So just kind of on another level,

1295
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.700
and I remember even asking him after being in his lab for two years,

1296
01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.670
because remember we had a couple of people in the lab who I just didn't think

1297
01:18:19.671 --> 01:18:23.930
were that good.
They really bugged me.
Their existence bothered me.

1298
01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:28.150
And I,
and I finally,
after being in the lab for two years,

1299
01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:31.550
worked up the courage to ask him like,
how he,

1300
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:34.220
because he's like this guy who's going to win a Nobel prize.

1301
01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:36.200
Like he's changing the game.

1302
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:41.390
And yet we had a couple people that I kind of thought were bottom feeders and I

1303
01:18:41.391 --> 01:18:45.500
was like,
you never get upset at them.
Like every,

1304
01:18:45.501 --> 01:18:50.450
I've never seen you get upset at these people.
How?
And he just said,

1305
01:18:50.451 --> 01:18:51.021
you know,
Peter,

1306
01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:56.021
I just look at everybody and I figure out at least one thing that they can do

1307
01:18:56.751 --> 01:19:00.740
well.
And I just figured out a way to empower them to do that one thing,

1308
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.650
even if they can't do the 10 things that I would expect you to do.

1309
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.570
I remember thinking,
I understand in theory what you're saying,

1310
01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.670
I can't do that.

1311
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.720
I can't tolerate mediocrity.

1312
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:18.440
So that was a huge thing that I learned.
Um,

1313
01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.160
and it never really hit home again until I was running a nonprofit because,

1314
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:28.280
you know,
there wasn't a lot of mediocrity at Hopkins.
Right.

1315
01:19:28.281 --> 01:19:31.070
And you sort of had your pick of the best residents there.

1316
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:34.220
Everybody there was the best at what they did.
You had amazing nurses,

1317
01:19:34.221 --> 01:19:38.960
amazing residents are amazing respiratory therapist and like everybody there was

1318
01:19:38.961 --> 01:19:43.070
like the best of their field,
right?
And then I go to Mckinsey,
same thing.

1319
01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:46.490
You've kind of got the best of the best all over again.
But you know,

1320
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.920
fast forward five years,
I'm now running a nonprofit.

1321
01:19:48.921 --> 01:19:51.610
Well all of a sudden you don't get the best of the best anymore.
You're,

1322
01:19:51.611 --> 01:19:56.270
you're drawing from like the third pool.
And I remember coming back to that,

1323
01:19:56.271 --> 01:20:00.440
which is,
you know what,
you're probably not cut out to do this.

1324
01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.300
You have two choices.
Don't be a leader,
just be your own dude.

1325
01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:08.160
We're be a leader but only with a players.

1326
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:13.310
But this notion of like you have the capacity to mentor the c players and maybe

1327
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:19.510
turn them into a B plus player.
Like,
I don't have those jeans.
I can't do it.
And,

1328
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.000
and not only that,
like I will destroy the c player and I don't mean to,

1329
01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:28.620
but I will bury them in the ground and,
and become a horrible human to them.
So,

1330
01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:32.490
so I also realize like I can be a really bad person.
Um,

1331
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:37.770
if I don't,
if I don't respect the work that someone's willing to do.

1332
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:41.740
<v 5>So do you,
did,
did you or do you ever have to find a counter to that?</v>

1333
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.740
Cause like if you were in the military and you and I were working together,

1334
01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.350
I would be like,
Hey Peter,

1335
01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:50.010
did you gotta get you gotta get you gotta Act like Rosen?
What does that road,

1336
01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.530
you've got to act like him because in the military you're not getting a players.

1337
01:20:53.531 --> 01:20:55.370
I mean,
you've got some great guys,
even in the seal teams,

1338
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:56.980
you got some great guys that are studied.
Got some.

1339
01:20:56.981 --> 01:20:59.290
Okay guys that are in the middle,
you've got some losers down at the bottom.

1340
01:20:59.410 --> 01:21:00.161
Guess what you need?

1341
01:21:00.161 --> 01:21:03.160
Every single one of them go on to talking with you and they all got to give you

1342
01:21:03.161 --> 01:21:04.990
what you,
everything made can.

1343
01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:09.010
And the more you create conflict with them and the more you are talking down to

1344
01:21:09.011 --> 01:21:10.370
them,
the less they're going to do there.

1345
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:13.650
You know how they're already has a c level player,
a d level player.
Yeah.

1346
01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.940
They're going down there.
You're not,
you're not making them any better.

1347
01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.710
So that's a,
did you ever try and correct that or do you just go through and say,

1348
01:21:20.711 --> 01:21:23.860
you know what,
you've realized that that's like a weakness of yours.

1349
01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:24.411
<v 6>Clear.</v>

1350
01:21:24.411 --> 01:21:29.411
There were two attributes that you can be a c player in and I can cope with one

1351
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:32.570
but I can't cope with the other and I accept it fully.

1352
01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:37.130
I can cope with someone who has a c plus intellect.

1353
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:40.580
So if you think about the intellect is the CPU of the computer.

1354
01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:43.280
I don't need everybody to have the fastest CPU.

1355
01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:47.970
I accept the fact that like we all have different sort of innate capacities to,

1356
01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.980
to,
to sort of process and do.
And you know,
we all move at different speeds.

1357
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:56.570
I can cope with variability there where I cannot cope with variability or maybe

1358
01:21:56.571 --> 01:21:57.291
I've just chosen,

1359
01:21:57.291 --> 01:22:02.291
I don't want to is I can't cope with variability on intent,

1360
01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:07.730
work ethic,
integrity like when you are,
if you can't be an a player there,

1361
01:22:07.731 --> 01:22:09.530
I actually don't want you in my life anymore.

1362
01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.470
And I think I'm old enough now that I've just said fuck it.

1363
01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:14.390
You know I'm not going to deal with it anymore.

1364
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:18.370
Life is too short and I'm not going to deal with c players who,

1365
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.190
who fail on those metrics.
I don't care how smart you are,

1366
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:25.760
but if you can't show up and work your ass off,
if you can't be honest,

1367
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:29.510
if you can't care,
if you can't want to get better,

1368
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:32.510
I actually don't want you in my life.
So you're right.
I probably,

1369
01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.591
I mean I think I,

1370
01:22:33.591 --> 01:22:37.910
I'm probably not cut out to be a leader because I can't take those people who

1371
01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:40.130
are failing on those metrics and work with,

1372
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:44.730
<v 5>well you just need to be a leader of a very high performing team,</v>

1373
01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:49.730
not of a regular regular to you.
Yeah.

1374
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:53.680
<v 6>I never had problems.
Right.
So when I was a resident,
you know,</v>

1375
01:22:53.681 --> 01:22:57.760
residency is very hierarchical.
Right.
You know,
you've got the med student,

1376
01:22:57.761 --> 01:23:00.730
the sub I,
the intern,
the second year resident,
the senior resident,

1377
01:23:00.731 --> 01:23:03.670
the chief resident,
the fellow,
the attending.
I mean it's,
it's,

1378
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:06.610
it's as clear as day in charge at any moment in time.

1379
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.600
And as I'm going up through those ranks for the most part,

1380
01:23:10.601 --> 01:23:14.080
I never really had difficulty with the teams underneath me.
But again,

1381
01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:17.070
I had the luxury of being at Hopkins.
Everybody there is the best,

1382
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.770
the med student,
they're the best,
the resident or the best Mckinsey's,
same thing,

1383
01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:24.950
you know,
you're dealing with the best of the best.
But Yeah,
running a nonprofit,

1384
01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:27.280
it was like a totally different world to me.

1385
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:32.590
And so I think the difference is a great leader could have succeeded in any

1386
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:34.500
environment.
You know,
they could have done it,

1387
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:36.370
they could have figured out like okay,

1388
01:23:36.371 --> 01:23:41.371
the reason this person like acts like a lazy sack of Shit is actually because of

1389
01:23:42.131 --> 01:23:42.964
this.

1390
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:47.680
And you can like figure out a way to like touch them and help them out of that.

1391
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:49.420
And I was just like,
yeah,
I'm not doing it.

1392
01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:55.990
<v 4>So that was,
so that's,
that's going back to NIH and you,</v>

1393
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.530
that was the first time you dealt with people.

1394
01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:02.500
<v 6>First Time I'd sort of seen in a long term working environment,</v>

1395
01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:05.380
like a couple people who weren't top agents.

1396
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.800
And again maybe part of it's cause you're in the government at that point and

1397
01:24:08.801 --> 01:24:12.820
you get some staff people there maybe who you know.
And part of it,

1398
01:24:12.821 --> 01:24:15.580
I think it was just because Steve Rosenberg was such an amazing guy and he could

1399
01:24:15.581 --> 01:24:18.910
get the best out of everybody that he might've just had a greater tolerance for

1400
01:24:18.911 --> 01:24:19.744
that.

1401
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:24.810
I think the second thing I learned was I would never be a world class scientist.

1402
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.540
So when you go to NIH,
you're really only going for one reason.

1403
01:24:31.541 --> 01:24:34.570
I mean I'm sure there's some people that go there just to check the box and say,

1404
01:24:34.571 --> 01:24:36.700
I was at the Nih.
That wasn't why I went.

1405
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:39.670
I went because Steve Rosenberg was my hero when I was in medical school.

1406
01:24:39.671 --> 01:24:44.380
I read his book called the transformed cell and I was like that book,

1407
01:24:44.381 --> 01:24:47.500
just know that book along with another book by you're getting Richard Fineman

1408
01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:48.460
called.
Surely you're joking.

1409
01:24:48.461 --> 01:24:52.960
Mr Feynman became kind of two of the most important books I read during my

1410
01:24:52.961 --> 01:24:57.760
twenties.
Um,
and actually wouldn't date somebody,

1411
01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.280
I wouldn't date a girl until she,

1412
01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:03.170
<v 4>rather than,
oh,</v>

1413
01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.040
we're going to go into it after,
after the podcast,

1414
01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:11.450
you and I are going to go to a full,
full on counseling session.
You need help.

1415
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:14.840
So,
so

1416
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:19.420
<v 6>what's,
so I went to NIH because I was like,
look this,
you know,</v>

1417
01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.020
this guy is my God and I want to be like that,

1418
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.890
right?

1419
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:29.780
I want to be the best surgeon scientists that ever lived.

1420
01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.520
And then I got there and I realized that surgery and science couldn't be more

1421
01:25:34.521 --> 01:25:35.354
different.

1422
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:40.390
Surgery is the ultimate immediate gratification like surgery.

1423
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:44.240
You get to fix the problem in hours.

1424
01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:47.210
Science is a lifetime of work,

1425
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.180
a lifetime of failure before success is in fact,

1426
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:52.940
one of the most remarkable stories from Rosenberg's book,

1427
01:25:52.941 --> 01:25:55.430
which of course I read well in medical school,

1428
01:25:55.431 --> 01:25:59.450
but it wasn't until a decade later when I'm living it that I really understood

1429
01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:04.690
why he was great and why I couldn't be great was from when he arrived at Nih in

1430
01:26:05.421 --> 01:26:08.720
1974 until he really had,

1431
01:26:08.721 --> 01:26:11.540
his first success was about 10 years.
So for 10 years,

1432
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:15.860
everything he was trying was failing and every patient died.

1433
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Every single person that showed up died until this one woman in 1984 when

1434
01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:28.490
finally they figured out how to doe something called Interleukin two and they

1435
01:26:28.491 --> 01:26:33.080
finally sort of cracked the first piece of what has turned into a very long code

1436
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:34.610
that 30 years later,

1437
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:38.540
we're just starting to make really amazing traction on.

1438
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:43.700
Now think about that for a second.
43 years ago,

1439
01:26:43.701 --> 01:26:48.140
he started that job for 10 straight years.
He just lost.

1440
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:53.230
It's like you're going to go play pickup every day for 10 years and lose every

1441
01:26:53.231 --> 01:26:54.064
day.

1442
01:26:55.790 --> 01:27:00.530
So what I realized was actually I don't have that intestinal fortitude.

1443
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.680
I cannot fail that frequently and still be at my best the next day.

1444
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:10.700
And again,
I hate admitting that cause it sounds awful.
It sounds like I'm just,

1445
01:27:10.701 --> 01:27:14.920
I suck and I guess I suck.
But like I realized like I could be good.
I mean,

1446
01:27:14.921 --> 01:27:18.200
and I could go after easier problems to solve where you can like,
you know,

1447
01:27:18.201 --> 01:27:21.230
get grants and you know,
just play the game.

1448
01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:23.690
And that's frankly what most people do in this space.

1449
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:29.060
But if you want to like change the game,
if you want to change mankind,

1450
01:27:29.061 --> 01:27:30.950
if you want to do something seminal,

1451
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:35.870
you have to be willing to fail forever.

1452
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:41.180
And I realized like I don't,
I find that ups,
again,

1453
01:27:41.181 --> 01:27:42.860
it's not that I'm addicted to the win,
it's not like,

1454
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:46.340
oh I have to be told good boy,
good boy,
good boy,
but I need someone,

1455
01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:49.640
I need to know that I have some control over my faith.

1456
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:53.510
Whereas in surgery you have some control over your fate.
You know,

1457
01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:56.480
there is a difference between being a good surgeon and being a bad surgeon.

1458
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:58.640
And it's not to say there's not a difference of you being a good scientist and a

1459
01:27:58.641 --> 01:27:59.101
great scientists,

1460
01:27:59.101 --> 01:28:04.010
but in science you are far less in control of what's going on then in surgery.

1461
01:28:04.090 --> 01:28:04.281
Now,

1462
01:28:04.281 --> 01:28:09.281
he must have had some longterm vision hypothesis that he absolutely believed it.

1463
01:28:11.021 --> 01:28:13.870
He laid it out.
He said there are four things that have to be true.

1464
01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:17.140
If we're going to ever figure out a way to get the immune system to fight
cancer,

1465
01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.210
these four things have to be true.
And if they're not true,
the immunes,

1466
01:28:20.230 --> 01:28:22.600
the human immune system,
we'll never be able to fight cancer.

1467
01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:27.820
And it took 10 years just to figure out the first proof of concept in a human.

1468
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:31.930
So yes,
they had a couple of successes in mice where they had demonstrated,
okay,

1469
01:28:31.931 --> 01:28:36.880
like at least in Nice you can do this.
But in cancer biology,

1470
01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:40.300
you know,
you don't get terribly excited about doing stuff in mice for very long.

1471
01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:40.751
You know,

1472
01:28:40.751 --> 01:28:45.100
there's a really famous Italian cancer biologist who once famously said,

1473
01:28:45.101 --> 01:28:49.790
if you can't cure cancer in a mouse,
you need a new profession.
That's,

1474
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:54.910
that's pretty low hanging fruit.
You,
you gotta be able do it in people.
So

1475
01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:59.560
it was while you were there that you would decide you weren't,

1476
01:28:59.561 --> 01:29:02.010
didn't want to go into medicine anymore.
Who gets

1477
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.290
<v 3>complicated,
right?
So then you're still,</v>

1478
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:06.250
I was still in the middle of my residency,
so what,

1479
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:09.420
so then I went back to Hopkins to finish my surgical training,

1480
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.190
but then I decided,
you know what,

1481
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.530
I think I might actually go into cardiac surgery,

1482
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.780
which I'd always been interested in.
So when I was in medical school,

1483
01:29:15.781 --> 01:29:20.781
I was really torn between cancer surgery and cardiac surgery and um,

1484
01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:23.580
you know,
to go into cancer surgery.

1485
01:29:23.581 --> 01:29:26.580
I think the real focus is going to be on research.
Like you want to,
you know,

1486
01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:29.430
you have to be involved in science and surgery.

1487
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:32.070
Whereas I thought in cardiac surgery,
you know,

1488
01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:34.170
it's just pretty much the coolest surgery.

1489
01:29:34.171 --> 01:29:37.400
Like it's the most technically demanding surgery by far.
Um,

1490
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.221
I shouldn't say by far,

1491
01:29:39.221 --> 01:29:41.790
I mean I think there are other things that are hardly on par technically,

1492
01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:43.980
but I was like,
I also came back in the mindset of,
you know what?

1493
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.940
I'm just going to become like a great technician,
right?
I just,

1494
01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.350
and I loved opera.

1495
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:52.890
I mean the heart is in one sense the simplest organ in the body.

1496
01:29:52.891 --> 01:29:55.020
Like it's really simple to understand what it's doing,
you know,

1497
01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:58.470
unlike the brain or the liver where it's just like 10 layers of complexity.

1498
01:29:58.471 --> 01:30:01.380
Like we kind of know what's going on with the heart and when it comes to

1499
01:30:01.381 --> 01:30:04.350
operating on it,
you know,
it's all a mechanical problem.
Like,
you know,
Oh,

1500
01:30:04.351 --> 01:30:07.430
this valve doesn't work.
Oh,
this pipe doesn't work.
Oh,
this thing gives them,
or,

1501
01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:11.970
um,
but that was sort of my concession of,
well,
you know what,

1502
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.080
you don't have to be the best surgeon scientists.

1503
01:30:14.081 --> 01:30:18.810
Why don't you just be the best surgeon?
Um,
because they are,

1504
01:30:18.811 --> 01:30:20.260
you're more in control,
right?

1505
01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:25.110
That's now just a function of how hard you want to work.
Um,
and that was,

1506
01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.140
that was,
that was shipper right up my alley.
And so then how did that path,

1507
01:30:28.141 --> 01:30:31.410
that drift to you don't want to do any of this anymore?
You know,

1508
01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:35.010
I think over the next couple of years,
I mean just a couple of things changed.

1509
01:30:35.011 --> 01:30:38.900
I mean,
one was,
you know,

1510
01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:41.580
I wasn't getting frustrated with these patients that we were talking about

1511
01:30:41.581 --> 01:30:43.440
earlier.
It wasn't the trauma patients that were getting to me.

1512
01:30:43.441 --> 01:30:46.140
There was something else that was getting to me that was much more frustrating,

1513
01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:47.400
which was the entire system.

1514
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:53.180
It seemed like everything we did was this last ditch effort to put incredible

1515
01:30:57.211 --> 01:31:02.160
resources into a person's life at the very end.

1516
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:05.460
And we didn't really move the needle that much.
Right.

1517
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:09.360
So it just seemed like a broken system.

1518
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.280
On the other end of the spectrum,

1519
01:31:11.281 --> 01:31:13.350
there's something else that did strike me as broken,

1520
01:31:13.351 --> 01:31:16.860
which actually contrasts or contradicts a little bit of what I said earlier.

1521
01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:20.370
I did feel that there was a subtle difference in the quality of residents.

1522
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:21.930
So where there's this guy,
Chris on and day,

1523
01:31:21.931 --> 01:31:25.410
who's like the best resident that ever lived,
you know,

1524
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.490
I think I was a good resident.

1525
01:31:26.491 --> 01:31:27.720
I think there were some other really good residents,

1526
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:31.620
but there were others that just,
you know,
they were good but they weren't great.

1527
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:34.770
And the thing about residency that really bugged me,

1528
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.880
and I think part of this was I was watching my brother who was a lawyer,

1529
01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.750
so he came out of law school when I came out of medical school,

1530
01:31:42.751 --> 01:31:43.740
like we were at the same time.

1531
01:31:43.741 --> 01:31:47.970
And so I start residency when he starts this law practice or he joined like this

1532
01:31:47.971 --> 01:31:52.920
law firm.
And I remember seeing that it was a totally different world.

1533
01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:56.580
Like their promotions seemed more merit based.

1534
01:31:56.910 --> 01:32:00.070
Like they went up the ranks,
they got bonuses,
like

1535
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.550
<v 6>all these things happened that were functioning.
So my brother was like,
you know,</v>

1536
01:32:04.090 --> 01:32:06.660
he was like breaking every record at his law firm,
right?

1537
01:32:06.661 --> 01:32:09.250
Like nobody could work as hard.
Nobody could bill as many hours.

1538
01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:12.820
Like nobody could like crush it like he could and he was being rewarded for it.

1539
01:32:12.821 --> 01:32:16.120
Now he ended up hating it.
He left.
He's now a public defender or a,

1540
01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:18.040
he's prosecuted rather.
So,
you know,

1541
01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:20.290
it takes a huge pay cut to go and become a prosecutor.

1542
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:21.610
Cause that's what he really wanted to do.

1543
01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.490
But the point is he could have risen all the way up that chain.

1544
01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:27.460
And I remember thinking in residency,
I'm like,
we all get paid the same.

1545
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:31.450
We all take the same number of years to get through.
It seems crazy to me.

1546
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:33.580
Like there's no other system where this would be the case.

1547
01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:38.581
Like I couldn't think of another system where you just had this complete total

1548
01:32:38.741 --> 01:32:43.000
lack of meritocracy.
Um,
it was really hard to get fired from residency.

1549
01:32:43.001 --> 01:32:46.510
Like I saw some real knuckleheads do some real stupid things.

1550
01:32:46.511 --> 01:32:49.510
I never actually saw anybody get fired,
which is not to say you couldn't.

1551
01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.250
I'm sure you could.
Um,

1552
01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:56.940
but I felt like I was working a lot harder than was necessary because I just

1553
01:33:01.811 --> 01:33:03.850
wanted to be better.
And I thought,
God,

1554
01:33:03.851 --> 01:33:07.600
it's still crazy that this is going to take this many years to get through.
So,

1555
01:33:07.770 --> 01:33:08.890
so the,
and I also,

1556
01:33:08.891 --> 01:33:11.290
there's just a whole bunch of things about this system structurally that I

1557
01:33:11.291 --> 01:33:14.230
thought were completely broken.
And then on the other side,

1558
01:33:14.231 --> 01:33:17.220
I just felt like healthcare was completely broken as a system.
Right?

1559
01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:20.110
So we have this idea,
you know,
I don't remember the exact stats,

1560
01:33:20.111 --> 01:33:21.280
but you're going to spend like,
you know,

1561
01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:26.830
50 60% of your entire healthcare dollars in like the last year or two of your

1562
01:33:26.831 --> 01:33:30.880
life.
I mean,
something Asinine.
Right?
And,
uh,
so at the time

1563
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:36.280
my wife said to me,
you know,

1564
01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:41.230
you are clearly upset about this system.
Uh,

1565
01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:45.670
I,
I think you have two choices.
You should either fix the system or leave it.

1566
01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.160
But I think that what you're doing now,

1567
01:33:48.161 --> 01:33:51.940
which is staying in the system and not changing it will probably not be

1568
01:33:51.941 --> 01:33:52.774
sustainable.

1569
01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:57.280
And so I think the toughest decision I ever made was at that point,

1570
01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:58.660
because I'm 30,

1571
01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:06.480
probably 32 33 I've invested 10 years into this and I'm thinking,

1572
01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:15.100
I want to do over,
I want a complete do over,
which,
you know,

1573
01:34:15.101 --> 01:34:20.050
everybody knows that the sunk cost fallacy is called the sunk cost fallacy for a

1574
01:34:20.051 --> 01:34:24.760
reason.
But it's still a damn compelling reason to keep doing something.

1575
01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:30.040
So,
so that was like a,
that was a super difficult time.
And you know,

1576
01:34:30.041 --> 01:34:32.290
in part you sort of feel like you're letting your mentor's down.

1577
01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:36.220
Cause a lot of people had invested a lot in me.
Right.
Hopkins had taken me,
right.

1578
01:34:36.221 --> 01:34:38.080
You're,
I was like one of the six chosen ones,

1579
01:34:38.081 --> 01:34:39.970
they only take six categorical is a year.

1580
01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.710
So now you're going to leave that program.
And there were,
you know,

1581
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:47.530
a couple of attendings I'd become really close to who really believed in me and

1582
01:34:47.531 --> 01:34:50.620
really said like,
you're gonna,
you're going to do something really special.

1583
01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:51.431
And then to say,

1584
01:34:51.431 --> 01:34:55.090
actually I'm going to leave and I'm not even going to be a doctor anymore.

1585
01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:59.330
I'm just going to go in.
Yeah.
So then you roll straight to Mackenzie.

1586
01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:04.460
Well,
so,
so what I wanted to do is actually go back and get an Mba because,
uh,

1587
01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.120
I really,
the other thing I missed a lot in medicine was a,

1588
01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:14.000
I missed quantitative stuff.
Like I,
I missed math.

1589
01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.290
Like I miss being an engineer.

1590
01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:19.370
And the few times I tried to bring that into medicine,
I got spanked.
Right.

1591
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:20.840
So you know,
there's one story.

1592
01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:23.960
I think I've talked about this maybe on a podcast before.

1593
01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:27.650
I don't think so though.
This is actually probably my first or second year.

1594
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:31.070
I'm in the ICU taking care of this patient and there's patients on a very,

1595
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:33.950
very toxic drug called gentamycin.

1596
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:36.950
This is a drug that has to be dosed very carefully.

1597
01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:39.110
So if you give too much of it,

1598
01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:42.200
you can destroy their hearing permanently and destroy their kidneys permanently.

1599
01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:43.430
If you don't give enough of it,

1600
01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:47.270
the bacteria that you're trying to kill will kill them.
So you're,
you're,
you're,

1601
01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.360
you have a very narrow range in which to give the dose.

1602
01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.140
So there is no standard dose.
It's not like,
oh,

1603
01:35:54.141 --> 01:35:56.300
just take 875 milligrams of this every 12 hours.

1604
01:35:56.301 --> 01:36:00.440
Now it's take it first guess based on the patient's body weight,

1605
01:36:00.441 --> 01:36:03.830
so this many milligrams per kilogram,
give it to them and then measure a level.

1606
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:07.670
And then once the level comes below a certain point,
give it again.

1607
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:11.150
And I remember thinking,
it doesn't even make sense.
Like,

1608
01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:16.220
surely we know enough about the kinetics of this drug that we could build a

1609
01:36:16.221 --> 01:36:18.860
mathematical model to predict when to give it.

1610
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:24.410
So I looked up,
you know,
a couple of papers,
a couple of books,
one night on call.

1611
01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:24.951
Sure enough,

1612
01:36:24.951 --> 01:36:29.951
I find like there's a very predictable alpha and Beta decay cycle for this drug.

1613
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:33.440
So like literally an excel,

1614
01:36:33.441 --> 01:36:37.760
I build a model that uses a very simple differential equation and it needs a few

1615
01:36:37.761 --> 01:36:41.600
inputs and it will predict the kinetic curve of this.
And I'm like,
all right,

1616
01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:46.280
let's try it out.
So take one of my patients gonna be on Gentamycin.

1617
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:48.500
I do everything the standard way,

1618
01:36:48.501 --> 01:36:51.770
but I plugged my numbers into the model to see what my model had predicted this

1619
01:36:51.771 --> 01:36:53.870
better and better.
And the answer was unquestionably.

1620
01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.210
So now I start to get a little confident in the idea.

1621
01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:58.250
So like the next night I'm like,
all right,

1622
01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.710
I'm actually going to start dosing the patient based on the model,

1623
01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.920
which never puts the patient in jeopardy because you're always going to check

1624
01:37:03.921 --> 01:37:07.490
the level before you dose,
but you're going to do so at the exact right moment.

1625
01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.520
And so my model predicted like at 4:31 AM this patient will Nader,

1626
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:15.470
which means that's when you need to dose them.

1627
01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.670
So sure enough at like four in the morning,
I get the pay,

1628
01:37:18.671 --> 01:37:22.310
I asked the nurse to draw the patient's blood to confirm they're just about to

1629
01:37:22.311 --> 01:37:26.210
Nader.
We're going to reduce them in a way we go.
So next morning on rounds,

1630
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:30.530
you know,
in the ICU you round as a big team,
I'm presenting that,
you know,

1631
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:33.830
this patient is one of my patients and I start explaining that,
okay,

1632
01:37:33.831 --> 01:37:36.710
so the patient received their dose of Gentamycin at four 30 in the morning and

1633
01:37:36.711 --> 01:37:37.191
the attending says,

1634
01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:40.250
well what do you mean four 31 and we never dose Genta at four 30 in the morning.

1635
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.380
We dose it at 7:00 AM always.
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,

1636
01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:49.340
but the patient hit their nadir at four 30 it's like,
I don't care.

1637
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:51.910
You know?
And so we got into this huge fight and like,
you know,

1638
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:56.550
I almost got fired that that would've got me fired by the way,
find me,

1639
01:37:56.551 --> 01:37:58.650
someone gets fired,
someone gets fired.

1640
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:03.580
And so I mean that hist me off beyond words.
Right.

1641
01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.540
It pissed me off that like,

1642
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:09.390
it just struck me as so anti intellectual.

1643
01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:12.780
Maybe my model wasn't perfect.
We never know.

1644
01:38:12.781 --> 01:38:17.400
But the fact that nobody even cared to say,
is there a better way to do this?

1645
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.160
That drove me that shit crazy.

1646
01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.910
And that's just one of many stories like that that happened through residency

1647
01:38:23.911 --> 01:38:28.350
where I was like,
it's almost like we want to live in the 1950s here.

1648
01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:30.210
And so,

1649
01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:35.070
so you have that sort of pain of problem solving is not valued.

1650
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.880
At least it didn't seem valued to me.
It was valued in the lab,

1651
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:40.860
but I had decided now I'm not going to be in the lab.

1652
01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.000
So here I live in this world where problem solving is not valued.

1653
01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:50.310
And I don't actually,
I'm not a quant anymore.
Like I don't do math anymore.

1654
01:38:50.311 --> 01:38:53.340
And I really loved math.
Um,
so I started,

1655
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.100
so I started tutoring kids in math.

1656
01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:59.910
I made like a little bit of free time so I could like tutor high school kids in

1657
01:38:59.911 --> 01:39:03.960
calculus just to like get my calculus on again,
missing it.

1658
01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:07.320
But it wasn't the same.
So,
so then I was like,
you know,

1659
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:09.870
maybe I'll go back and get an Mba.
So I looked into that,

1660
01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.280
didn't feel like I was already drowning in debt at that point in time.
You know,

1661
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:17.340
you've got med school debt is sort of painful and you know,

1662
01:39:17.341 --> 01:39:18.390
residency you're making,

1663
01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:21.090
I think at the time were making about 34,000 bucks a year.
So it's,

1664
01:39:21.091 --> 01:39:25.560
you're not even putting a dent in your $200,000 debt sort of thing.
So,

1665
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:29.580
so then I remember one night I was in,

1666
01:39:29.610 --> 01:39:32.640
I was on call and I was really pissed to be on call this night,

1667
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:35.250
this and now you can relate to this better than I'll ever be able to relate to

1668
01:39:35.251 --> 01:39:37.140
it because I'm sure this happened to you your whole life.

1669
01:39:37.141 --> 01:39:41.460
But my best friend from high school tells me in February,

1670
01:39:41.461 --> 01:39:46.350
he's getting married that August,
and I'm the best man.
He lives in Toronto.

1671
01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:48.600
So he's like,
this is the date of my wedding.

1672
01:39:48.601 --> 01:39:51.300
I figured it was like August 5th it's a Saturday.

1673
01:39:52.650 --> 01:39:54.660
I want you to be the best manner,
completely honored.

1674
01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:57.450
So I tell my program director in February,

1675
01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.790
can I not be on call that day or the day before?

1676
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.410
I just need to,

1677
01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:07.650
I need to be able to fly out to Baltimore on a Friday and come back on a Sunday.

1678
01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:13.380
And he's like,
Hey,
that's no problem.
I remind him three times.
No problem,

1679
01:40:13.410 --> 01:40:15.720
no problem,
no problem.
Sure enough,
the call schedule comes out.

1680
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:19.800
I'm on call Saturday,
I'm on call the day of the wedding.
Like,

1681
01:40:19.801 --> 01:40:23.610
you've got to be kidding me.
So it's two o'clock that morning.

1682
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:28.460
I'm down in the Er looking at a chest CT scan on a guy who I'm worried has it,

1683
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:32.570
what's called a dissecting aorta.
And,
um,

1684
01:40:33.150 --> 01:40:36.390
the radiologist,
you know,
I,

1685
01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.110
I introduced myself and she's very nice and she sort of walks me through the CT

1686
01:40:40.111 --> 01:40:43.110
scan and then we just start shooting the breeze a little bit and she says,

1687
01:40:43.111 --> 01:40:45.620
Oh yeah,
you seem kind of down tonight.
What's up?
And I was like,
hi,

1688
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:47.910
I'm just kind of pissed off.
I mean,
wish I wasn't here at Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1689
01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:50.820
blah.
And,
and she's like,
yeah,
I can,
I can relate.

1690
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:53.860
I used to be in a surgical residency myself and I was like,
oh,
really?
She goes,

1691
01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:54.161
yeah,
yeah.

1692
01:40:54.161 --> 01:40:58.450
I did my internship and surgery up at the University of Seattle and I just hated

1693
01:40:58.451 --> 01:41:01.420
it so much that I left and actually joined this company called Mckinsey.

1694
01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.990
I worked there for two years,
but then decided I wanted to come back to medicine.

1695
01:41:04.991 --> 01:41:07.480
So,
uh,
but I wanted to do it in sort of a kinder,
gentler way.

1696
01:41:07.481 --> 01:41:09.220
So that's why I'm back here doing radiology.
And I was like,

1697
01:41:09.250 --> 01:41:12.310
oh well what's this Mckinsey thing?
I'd never heard of it.

1698
01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:16.990
And so she told me all about it and I was like,
Huh,
that sounds interesting.

1699
01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.420
How do I apply?
You know?
And that was sort of the beginning of it.

1700
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:22.300
So she introduced me to some folks and you know,

1701
01:41:22.301 --> 01:41:26.260
then I had to like study all over again cause to the way they interview at these

1702
01:41:26.261 --> 01:41:29.920
consulting firms is very specific and it's not you.

1703
01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.800
You can be the smartest dude in the world if you show up and you haven't thought

1704
01:41:32.801 --> 01:41:37.180
through how to solve a case like what are called these case interviews,
you're,

1705
01:41:37.181 --> 01:41:38.014
you're going to flail.

1706
01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:41.320
So you have to actually put in some like work and then study.
So I,
you know,

1707
01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:44.380
got a bunch of books on case interviews and I'd be sitting in the trauma bay

1708
01:41:44.381 --> 01:41:47.710
waiting for bodies to come in.
I'd be like reading my cases,
you know,

1709
01:41:47.711 --> 01:41:51.400
case interview things before.
So that,
that's,
that was sort of the transition.

1710
01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.770
<v 4>And then you walk,
you walk out,
you walk away from medicine you'd go into,</v>

1711
01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:59.640
so where are you doing medicine specific consulting.

1712
01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.920
So I was looking at rooted

1713
01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:04.670
<v 6>to do that because Mckinsey,
um,
and I,</v>

1714
01:42:04.671 --> 01:42:07.590
I'm sure this is true of like Bain and Bcg,

1715
01:42:07.591 --> 01:42:11.790
which are kind of the other two really big um,
management consulting firms.

1716
01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:12.630
Um,

1717
01:42:12.630 --> 01:42:16.740
they recruit about a third of their consultants who out of sort of what we call

1718
01:42:16.770 --> 01:42:20.430
non typical or atypical rather,
um,
backgrounds.

1719
01:42:20.431 --> 01:42:24.750
So people who have PhDs or jds or MDS,
but who didn't go to business school.

1720
01:42:24.751 --> 01:42:27.420
And then so they send you off to do business school that summer.

1721
01:42:27.421 --> 01:42:29.460
They do this and call it a mini Mba,
which was,

1722
01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:33.480
I mean it was like being a kid in a candy store again because I got to go spend

1723
01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:36.510
a whole summer in school again,
learning finance,

1724
01:42:36.511 --> 01:42:38.370
like learning all of these things that,
you know,

1725
01:42:38.371 --> 01:42:39.730
for some people might seem kind of dry,

1726
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:44.040
but when you're like just dying to get back into numbers,

1727
01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:45.930
I was like,
oh my God.
Like,
you know,

1728
01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:48.540
I remember the first time we learned what was called the efficient frontier,

1729
01:42:48.541 --> 01:42:51.330
which is basically this differential equation that describes,
you know,

1730
01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:55.590
an investment philosophy.
I was like,
like,
I can't believe I'm doing this again.

1731
01:42:55.591 --> 01:43:00.570
I can't believe it.
So,
so then we show up for orientation.

1732
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:02.820
I'm in San Francisco at this time.

1733
01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:05.130
That was the other thing I wanted to get back to California.
So I was like,

1734
01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.680
you know,
San Francisco,
please.

1735
01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:12.660
So during the first a drink during orientation week,

1736
01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:15.950
I was approached by one of the staffers there and they said,
hey,
you know,

1737
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.230
your background looks like you've done a lot of mathematics.
I said,
yeah.

1738
01:43:19.231 --> 01:43:20.820
They said,
well,
you know,

1739
01:43:20.821 --> 01:43:23.540
we know you're a physician and you're probably here to work on,
you know,
the,

1740
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:26.400
all the medical teams are going to try to grab you to have you work on some

1741
01:43:26.401 --> 01:43:30.070
biotech thing or whatever.
But,
um,
we have this,
um,

1742
01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:35.660
banking issue that is very important to some of our clients and it requires an

1743
01:43:35.671 --> 01:43:38.940
ability to do stochastic calculus would,
would you be up for doing that?

1744
01:43:38.941 --> 01:43:40.380
And I was like,
of course.

1745
01:43:41.010 --> 01:43:45.540
And so then that was basically the beginning and I never really stopped doing

1746
01:43:45.541 --> 01:43:50.040
that stuff.
So,
so I ended up doing what's called credit risk modeling,

1747
01:43:50.041 --> 01:43:53.540
which then,
which started out around this thing called the Basel to accord,

1748
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:55.270
which was a type of,
uh,

1749
01:43:55.460 --> 01:44:00.350
this was a regulation that came out in the mid two thousands that required banks

1750
01:44:00.351 --> 01:44:04.160
to hold a certain amount of capital against unexpected losses.

1751
01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:09.161
So banks have a long history of knowing how to hold capital for expected losses,

1752
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:13.160
but they don't really know what to do for unexpected losses.
And in particular,

1753
01:44:13.161 --> 01:44:17.810
the problem that was damning was something called asset value correlations.
So,

1754
01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:22.190
um,
if you're a bank,
you,
you could have 27 lines of business,

1755
01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:27.050
you do first mortgage,
second mortgage,
Otto student credit card,

1756
01:44:27.051 --> 01:44:27.884
like you name it.

1757
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:33.080
And the problem is nobody really understood how those assets correlated.

1758
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:37.100
So if your loss rate is x in this,

1759
01:44:37.101 --> 01:44:39.980
what's the probability that it impacts the loss rate in that?

1760
01:44:40.690 --> 01:44:42.670
<v 5>So where that,
where the rubber meets the road is,</v>

1761
01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:47.380
if I can't make my house payment,
I'm probably not making my car payment either.

1762
01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:51.610
That's right.
And that's what nobody got to realized.

1763
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.870
Everything went down.

1764
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:56.690
<v 6>Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So that turned into,
as we were in the midst of that,</v>

1765
01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:57.940
<v 5>because the,</v>

1766
01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:02.940
because the banks used to leverage themselves so much that they could do well in

1767
01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.590
when the market crashed,
they weren't ready for it.
They couldn't handle it.

1768
01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:08.620
<v 6>You know,
it's such an,
I mean,</v>

1769
01:45:08.621 --> 01:45:11.420
it's like literally one of my favorite topics actually,
which are,

1770
01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:14.260
I'm sure your listeners don't want to get bored to tears on it,

1771
01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.550
but the first of all,

1772
01:45:15.551 --> 01:45:20.200
the best movie of all the movies that have like tried to explain what's going
on,

1773
01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:25.230
the big short by far does the best job because it actually explains the,

1774
01:45:27.370 --> 01:45:29.350
the sequence of events that went,

1775
01:45:29.630 --> 01:45:33.310
that took this from being just an isolated problem to a systemic problem.

1776
01:45:33.311 --> 01:45:38.311
Most people miss the subtlety of how this thing ceased to be contained,

1777
01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:39.760
as you know,

1778
01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.410
because technically a housing crisis shouldn't have affected the global economy.

1779
01:45:44.650 --> 01:45:49.650
So it was these instruments called CDOs that effectively allowed this problem to

1780
01:45:51.791 --> 01:45:56.080
become enormous.
But at the time,
the bigger issue was,

1781
01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:01.180
you know,
just a great example of Hubris that exists everywhere,
right?

1782
01:46:01.210 --> 01:46:06.210
Which is one we don't like looking at data that contradicts our point of view

1783
01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:10.750
and we're all guilty of this.
I'm guilty of this.

1784
01:46:10.751 --> 01:46:12.780
I find myself doing it and I actually am now quite amused.

1785
01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.980
I'm so attuned to it now that I'm quite immune.

1786
01:46:14.981 --> 01:46:16.330
It's like if I'm flipping through Twitter,

1787
01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:21.340
I'll see a story that is completely against how I feel and I don't want to read

1788
01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:24.340
it.
And then like the next one will be like exactly how I feel.
I want to read it.

1789
01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:28.420
And I'm like,
Dude,
look what you just did man.
You've got to stop,
pull back,

1790
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:33.510
go assume you are wrong and keep going and try to figure out if you're but so,

1791
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:38.210
so at the,
at the banking level,
I mean,
and we,
you know,
the,

1792
01:46:38.211 --> 01:46:40.420
the canary in the coal mine here,
while there were many,

1793
01:46:40.421 --> 01:46:44.410
but in 2000 early 2006 2000 yeah.

1794
01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:47.650
Mid 2006 we had,

1795
01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.010
when we were trying to do these asset correlations,

1796
01:46:50.011 --> 01:46:53.250
one of the biggest problems we had is we couldn't,

1797
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:56.790
we only had 10 years of data.

1798
01:46:57.450 --> 01:47:00.240
The banks only had this data recorded for 10 years.

1799
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:02.820
We didn't have losses to model.

1800
01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:07.840
And I remember saying to like,
you know,
the controller at this bank,
I'm like,

1801
01:47:08.530 --> 01:47:08.951
hey man,

1802
01:47:08.951 --> 01:47:13.300
like it's going to be really hard to build you a model of losses when you don't

1803
01:47:13.301 --> 01:47:16.540
have any historical losses.
And he goes,
well,
and that's mortgages.

1804
01:47:16.541 --> 01:47:20.440
Mortgages can't lose money,
right?
So that was,
and we can laugh at that now,

1805
01:47:20.441 --> 01:47:24.640
but at the time that was like not an unreasonable point of view,
right?

1806
01:47:24.641 --> 01:47:28.300
Like you can't lose money on a first mortgage.
Think about it.

1807
01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:31.960
You got to put 20% down.
You want to buy a home for a hundred grand,

1808
01:47:31.961 --> 01:47:35.230
you better show up with 20 you better be able to document.
You have a job,

1809
01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.210
you better do this,
you better do that.
You'd better do that.

1810
01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:41.770
So you now the bank's only on the hook for 80 on a home that's been legitimately

1811
01:47:41.771 --> 01:47:44.620
appraised for a hundred and you've shown documentation,

1812
01:47:44.650 --> 01:47:48.610
so you're at least going to pay that thing down to 70 such that worst case

1813
01:47:48.611 --> 01:47:53.410
scenario,
market falls by 10% houses worth 90 you lose your job,

1814
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:57.250
guess who still gets paid the bank,
they still get their 70 sure.

1815
01:47:57.250 --> 01:47:59.050
If you're in the business of creating a second mortgage,

1816
01:47:59.051 --> 01:48:00.310
you take a little bit more risk,

1817
01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:04.330
but there's no reason you should have been losing money on first mortgages.

1818
01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:08.950
And so
you fast forward a year.

1819
01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:10.240
Well especially because,

1820
01:48:10.241 --> 01:48:12.350
don't worry about the value of the house cause that's going to go,

1821
01:48:12.351 --> 01:48:16.390
he's going to go up.
That's right.
So we're good to go.
Oh well that's where,

1822
01:48:16.391 --> 01:48:19.210
and I remember even when I was in Baltimore,
one of my buddies,

1823
01:48:19.211 --> 01:48:20.590
because you know the residents,

1824
01:48:20.591 --> 01:48:22.750
we're always looking for a way to make a buck on the side,
right?

1825
01:48:22.751 --> 01:48:25.180
When you're making 34 k a year,
you got it.

1826
01:48:25.210 --> 01:48:27.640
You got to come up with and the only saving grace as you can't spend money,

1827
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:31.450
like your,
your closes free,
you're in scrubs all the time.

1828
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:35.170
You're kind of eating for free all the time.

1829
01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:38.070
Cause I eat off the patients' trays,
whatever,
they didn't finish,

1830
01:48:38.071 --> 01:48:42.070
I like go to the nurse's station or eat all this crap.
So I didn't,

1831
01:48:42.250 --> 01:48:44.680
I didn't actually spend much money.
Um,

1832
01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:47.950
pens was like the only thing I wasted money on.

1833
01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.580
Like I collect mom blogs and so even through residency I would still buy these

1834
01:48:51.581 --> 01:48:55.540
beautiful pens.
So,
um,
so yeah,

1835
01:48:55.541 --> 01:48:57.010
I remember one of my buddies being like,
dude,

1836
01:48:57.011 --> 01:49:01.240
we got to start buying houses in Baltimore because like they're so cheap and you

1837
01:49:01.241 --> 01:49:05.200
can get them with no money down.
So you could buy a house for 200,000 bucks,

1838
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:07.780
put like $5,000 down.

1839
01:49:08.050 --> 01:49:13.050
If that house goes up to two 20 you just made 25 k you made 20 k on your five.

1840
01:49:14.921 --> 01:49:19.921
We're going all the way and no one does the math of what if it goes down to one

1841
01:49:20.051 --> 01:49:23.440
90.
You just lost everything.
Right.

1842
01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:28.630
So luckily I didn't get it on any of those sweetheart deals.

1843
01:49:28.930 --> 01:49:30.640
Although if you time them right there,

1844
01:49:30.641 --> 01:49:33.310
a lot of people did make a lot of money on those deals before the shoe fell.

1845
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:37.330
So when,
when the,
when the,
when things started to become clear,

1846
01:49:37.331 --> 01:49:38.650
so in early

1847
01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:45.270
in early oh seven,
it became clear sub subprime mortgages,

1848
01:49:45.271 --> 01:49:50.050
we're going to be a problem by August of Oh seven,

1849
01:49:50.051 --> 01:49:54.640
eight a very famous then famous analyst.
Uh,

1850
01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:55.211
what's her name?

1851
01:49:55.211 --> 01:49:59.770
Meredith Whitney I believe is her name.

1852
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:05.400
I think she was at Oppenheimer called something that at the time seemed crazy.

1853
01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:10.390
She said,
Citi Group is going to cut its dividend next month.
So for city group,

1854
01:50:10.410 --> 01:50:10.871
you know,
huge,

1855
01:50:10.871 --> 01:50:15.190
one of the largest banks in the country to not pay a dividend for Q three seemed

1856
01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:17.320
impossible.
But she'd done the math.
She's like,
yeah,

1857
01:50:17.321 --> 01:50:18.160
there's no way they're getting,

1858
01:50:18.161 --> 01:50:20.770
they're getting crushed on these mortgage backed securities.

1859
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:24.490
And everyone was like,
she doesn't know.
She's talking about sure enough,

1860
01:50:24.610 --> 01:50:27.610
Q3 comes along,
city cuts its dividend.
Chuck Prince,

1861
01:50:27.611 --> 01:50:32.050
the CEO of city gets fired.
And at that point it's like God damn.

1862
01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:37.660
But again,
everybody was still thinking this is just a sub prime problem.

1863
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:41.260
It's an inch wide and yeah,
it's a mile deep,
but it's an inch wide.
Well,

1864
01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:45.700
in the background we're working on another problem which is prime mortgages,

1865
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:48.100
that which everybody thinks is totally fine,

1866
01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:53.230
that which has a historical default ratio of less than half a percent and we're

1867
01:50:53.231 --> 01:50:58.120
seeing in the data the data that was right in front of this bank the whole time.

1868
01:50:58.570 --> 01:51:01.840
Oh,
there's a,
there's a tsunami coming.

1869
01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:06.310
Your default rate's going to hit four or 5% which again,

1870
01:51:06.311 --> 01:51:09.400
that might not sound like a lot.
That's 10 times your default rate.

1871
01:51:09.670 --> 01:51:13.630
It's going to be actually higher than that as we learned and your loss given a

1872
01:51:13.631 --> 01:51:15.310
default is going up much higher.

1873
01:51:15.311 --> 01:51:20.311
So loss is actually the dot product of probability of default and loss given

1874
01:51:20.981 --> 01:51:23.950
default.
Okay?
You guys are my only two customers.

1875
01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:29.280
Probability you default is 50% the probability you to faults 10% if you default,

1876
01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:35.160
you will lose 100,000 so it's 10% times 100,000 I expect to lose 10,000 on you

1877
01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:37.000
if you default.

1878
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:42.030
It's 2000 so 50% times 2000 a thousand so my total expected losses 11,000 so

1879
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:48.370
this is,
you know,
you do this 88 million times for every account you have.

1880
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:52.300
And the model to predict probability to fault in loss given default are enormous

1881
01:51:52.301 --> 01:51:56.470
models that each have 50 variables in them.
Actually the PD does,
the LGD doesn't,

1882
01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:00.310
but what people didn't realize is the loss given defaults were skyrocketing.

1883
01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:05.710
It was like,
in fact,
again at the level of just being kind of a math idiot.

1884
01:52:05.711 --> 01:52:10.360
Like that to me was so amazing to watch,
right?

1885
01:52:10.361 --> 01:52:14.290
It was like,
Holy Shit,
watch these LGDs go.

1886
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:16.300
They're just like blowing up like cheese.

1887
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:19.630
And then you knew once the PD triggered,

1888
01:52:19.631 --> 01:52:22.930
meaning what's the probability of default went?
Oh,
it was,
it was,

1889
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.440
it was going to become a nonlinear catastrophe and it turned out so November

1890
01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:30.851
15th Thursday,

1891
01:52:30.851 --> 01:52:35.230
November 15 2007 it was kind of the day like that was the matrix moment.

1892
01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:37.120
So I had a team,
great example.

1893
01:52:37.121 --> 01:52:40.420
I was able to be a leader for once because I had an amazing team.

1894
01:52:40.630 --> 01:52:43.270
I had a team in San Francisco of four people.

1895
01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.220
I had a team in India of four guys.

1896
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:50.600
We worked around the clock 16 hours a day every day except Sundays.

1897
01:52:50.601 --> 01:52:53.960
We took off and we would pass the model back and forth to each other.

1898
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:56.060
Amazing like it was like it was,

1899
01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:58.850
it was pure bliss to be working that hard on this problem.

1900
01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:03.560
And on that day we basically came up with four independent models that all

1901
01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:08.561
predicted how bad this thing was going to be and we presented it to the

1902
01:53:09.171 --> 01:53:13.220
leadership of this bank and it's really funny,

1903
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:18.020
I was a manager,
so,
so it Mckinsey,
you have these levels like analyst,

1904
01:53:18.021 --> 01:53:19.760
associate manager,
junior partner,

1905
01:53:19.761 --> 01:53:23.120
partner director for a meeting of that stature,

1906
01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.580
meaning you're talking to the entire leadership of the bank.

1907
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:29.570
The senior partner would only be the one to predict.
I'd be in the corner,

1908
01:53:29.571 --> 01:53:34.070
work in the PowerPoint answering a question if piped up because there's going to

1909
01:53:34.071 --> 01:53:37.250
be a technical question,
but the senior partner would do all the talking.

1910
01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:40.490
But on that day we go into the meeting and the senior partner says,
Peter,

1911
01:53:40.491 --> 01:53:43.250
you should present this.
And I said,
are you sure?

1912
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:47.300
Cause I'm like the third most junior guy in the room here.
And he said,
yeah,

1913
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:48.860
two reasons.
One,

1914
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:51.500
you're the only one who actually understands how all of these models work.

1915
01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:54.200
And T and this is the funniest thing he said,
he goes to,

1916
01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.800
because of all of your experience with cancer patients,

1917
01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:03.160
you're going to be very good at answering hard questions about bad things

1918
01:54:03.651 --> 01:54:05.810
happening.
Wow.
And I was like,
okay.

1919
01:54:06.170 --> 01:54:11.170
So I stepped in and I did my best to be empathetic and nonjudgmental and like

1920
01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:14.510
just as evidenced fact based as I could.

1921
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:16.010
And this is what this says and this is with it.

1922
01:54:16.130 --> 01:54:20.030
When you look at the run rate model and the PGD says this and the Lgd says this,

1923
01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:24.260
and the vintage model says this and you know here.
And so finally,

1924
01:54:24.261 --> 01:54:28.820
like the president of the bank says,
how much money are we going to lose?

1925
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:32.210
Like she was kind of like,
you know,
like all good leaders.
She's just like,

1926
01:54:32.211 --> 01:54:34.220
just get,
tell me the God damn answer first.

1927
01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:39.980
So I said I had to think on my feet like pretty quickly about a way to put it in

1928
01:54:39.981 --> 01:54:40.431
terms.

1929
01:54:40.431 --> 01:54:45.431
So I said you're going to lose more money in the next 18 months than you've made

1930
01:54:46.701 --> 01:54:48.440
in the last 10 years.

1931
01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.990
<v 7>And see the Jocko answer to that question,</v>

1932
01:54:53.290 --> 01:54:56.590
how much money are we to lose would have been all of it.

1933
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.180
That's what we're seeing you and me on Twitter.
Right?

1934
01:55:03.190 --> 01:55:06.280
Like you always have the best answer.

1935
01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:09.190
Like always cause that that would be like,
Hey John,

1936
01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:13.360
can you just picked it up on Twitter?
Like the CEO of the bank.
Hey Jakob,

1937
01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:17.830
how much money we're gonna lose all.
Look Peter,
one of three.

1938
01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:22.620
Well start with your Ebitda last year.
Multiply that by two of

1939
01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:29.590
three of three.
Did they,
they listened to you at all?

1940
01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:31.960
They want to believe that data.
Good.

1941
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.620
<v 6>I was impossible.
That was impossible to fathom.
Uh,</v>

1942
01:55:34.650 --> 01:55:37.110
years later cause I had it by this point left Mckinsey.

1943
01:55:37.410 --> 01:55:42.410
But I stayed in close touch with that team and I reached back out to that senior

1944
01:55:42.541 --> 01:55:45.030
partner who,
um,
actually I'm still very close with you.

1945
01:55:45.031 --> 01:55:48.120
I just got an email from him two days ago.
I said,
hey man,

1946
01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:51.780
remember all those models?
Yeah,
yeah.
Did we,

1947
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.700
where we roughly close?
And he goes oh no,

1948
01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:59.520
the model is underestimated by a third.
I mean I was like,

1949
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.240
it seems like we kept trying to tone the models down cause they kept giving us

1950
01:56:03.241 --> 01:56:06.120
these answers and we were like,
damn,

1951
01:56:06.121 --> 01:56:09.330
like there's no way it can be this bad.
And we were like,
oh,

1952
01:56:09.331 --> 01:56:12.540
let's make this assumption more conservative and let's do this.
You know,

1953
01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:14.820
in the end it was like,
nope,
it was actually that bad.

1954
01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.510
<v 5>Brutal.
So then,
now I remember I saw you tell a story one time.</v>

1955
01:56:19.570 --> 01:56:21.340
It's on,
it's on youtube somewhere,

1956
01:56:21.370 --> 01:56:24.910
but you're talking about a patient you were working on,

1957
01:56:24.911 --> 01:56:27.160
you kind of alluded to this earlier,
you know,

1958
01:56:27.190 --> 01:56:31.150
either pre diabetic or diabetic and you're sitting there going,

1959
01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:34.660
you gotta be kidding me.
Cause the day before you tried to save someone's life,

1960
01:56:34.661 --> 01:56:37.520
that was,
you know,
a young kid.
And that was sort of it.

1961
01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:42.340
Was that the first time that you started thinking about nutrition as a,

1962
01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.010
you know,
and an earlier you talked about,
hey,

1963
01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.330
we do all this stuff at the end of the life,

1964
01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.180
it's all this prevention to prevent someone from actually dying.

1965
01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:51.990
But if we would have invested some of that money up front,

1966
01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:55.660
top these people out to eat,
we'd been better off.

1967
01:56:55.661 --> 01:56:57.280
Is that sort of where it came from or

1968
01:56:57.450 --> 01:57:00.830
<v 6>not at all?
I mean,
I never made that connection at that time.
Right.</v>

1969
01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:03.150
So at that time it was just what you described.

1970
01:57:03.151 --> 01:57:07.320
It was just the visceral reaction of I'm so angry at you.

1971
01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:12.360
How can you not take care of yourself?
How can you be sitting here?

1972
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:15.810
So fat,
so diabetic,
you know,

1973
01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:18.870
over and over again,
you come in here to,

1974
01:57:18.871 --> 01:57:23.250
to have these ulcers debriefed it and to have these things amputated and you

1975
01:57:23.251 --> 01:57:26.400
know how the story's going to go.
Like just get it together.
So,
so this was,

1976
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:29.030
I mean I didn't say those words,
but that's how I'm feeling.
Right.

1977
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:33.180
And so that's,

1978
01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:37.170
that's just part of like the like the callousness that developed towards that

1979
01:57:37.171 --> 01:57:40.170
subset of patient.
It wasn't until

1980
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:46.530
probably 2009.
Um,
so I'm out of medicine now,

1981
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.570
but I was becoming overweight and I was pre diabetic.
I wasn't diabetic,

1982
01:57:51.571 --> 01:57:56.520
I was pre diabetic and I was,
you know,
that I was sort of come full circle.
Right.

1983
01:57:56.530 --> 01:57:58.680
And I was like,
wait a minute,
wait,
I do everything right.

1984
01:57:58.710 --> 01:58:01.170
I mean I'm swimming four hours a day,

1985
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:06.150
I'm following that Goddamn food pyramid to the core and I don't need saturated

1986
01:58:06.151 --> 01:58:10.620
fat.
I'm like,
you know,
I,
I carb load like a band sheet.

1987
01:58:10.621 --> 01:58:15.170
Like why am I,
why is all this stuff happening to me?
And so,

1988
01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:20.100
so then when I went through my whole discovery process of figuring that out,

1989
01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:24.780
it was only then that I really thought back and reflected upon,
you know,

1990
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:29.550
the horrible way I had treated,
not just that patient particular,

1991
01:58:29.551 --> 01:58:31.830
but that obviously many other patients like her.

1992
01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:37.080
I remember her case specifically because it was probably like the absolute low

1993
01:58:37.081 --> 01:58:39.520
point of my existence.
Um,

1994
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:45.850
so unfortunately it took me sort of failing on my own because at least then I

1995
01:58:46.451 --> 01:58:49.720
could say this isn't a willpower problem.
It's not like you don't care.

1996
01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.220
It's not like you're not trying,

1997
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:55.180
you're doing what you're told to do and you're failing miserably.

1998
01:58:55.181 --> 01:59:00.181
So either you're an outlier or maybe the advice is incorrect.

1999
01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:02.670
<v 5>So you're eating what you're being told to eat,</v>

2000
01:59:02.671 --> 01:59:06.840
your car bloating and you're still getting fat.
Yup.

2001
01:59:07.110 --> 01:59:08.640
And at this time you're swimming,

2002
01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:12.180
we were just talking about it before the podcast.
You're doing ultra long swims,

2003
01:59:12.330 --> 01:59:17.160
dozens of miles worth of swimming,
which by the way,
in seal training,

2004
01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:20.970
then basic seal training,
the longest you swim is five and a half nautical miles,

2005
01:59:20.971 --> 01:59:24.540
which is 6.2 statute miles,
which,

2006
01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:27.510
and that's with swim fins on.
So you're out there in the end,

2007
01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:32.460
you're out there in the open ocean swimming 12 1518 miles at a time,

2008
01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:35.610
and you're training for that working hard.

2009
01:59:35.611 --> 01:59:40.611
And you're quote unquote eating right because you're not eating saturated fat.

2010
01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:44.790
And yet you're getting fat.
You go into the doctor,
you get blood tests,

2011
01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:48.540
and they say,
oh yeah,
by the way,
you're prediabetic and you just say to yourself,

2012
01:59:48.541 --> 01:59:49.680
what is going on?

2013
01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:51.420
<v 6>Yeah.
And truth be told,</v>

2014
01:59:51.421 --> 01:59:56.280
I was actually more pissed just from the vanity standpoint at being fat.
I mean,

2015
01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:00.850
<v 5>which I get for those of you on the podcast,
echo is nodding his head.</v>

2016
02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:02.683
We did that.

2017
02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:06.060
<v 6>I mean,
I wish I could say like,
oh,
it didn't bother me to be fat.</v>

2018
02:00:06.090 --> 02:00:10.680
It did bother me to be fat.
It really bothered me to be fat.
Right?
It bothered me.

2019
02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:14.040
It bothered me a lot actually.

2020
02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:19.050
And so much so that I actually wanted to get a gastric bypass.
And so I went,

2021
02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:20.613
uh,
it's like,

2022
02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:24.900
so right now I'm about 175 I was like probably two or five to to 10.

2023
02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:29.760
<v 5>It's again,
after this podcast,
you and I were going into counseling session.</v>

2024
02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:34.500
<v 6>So I went to,</v>

2025
02:00:34.501 --> 02:00:39.501
I finally got my doctor to get me a referral to this guy named Ken Fujioka,

2026
02:00:39.511 --> 02:00:43.110
who's like a very prominent bariatric physician here in San Diego.

2027
02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:48.000
So I finally go to see Fujioka.
So I'm sitting in the waiting room and uh,

2028
02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:51.000
actually I think I told this story on Tim's podcast.

2029
02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:55.050
I don't remember telling you,
but it is in,
that's in the book.

2030
02:00:55.110 --> 02:00:58.780
It's in the his I think the stories.
Yeah.
So I,

2031
02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:03.000
but in the spirit of assuming nobody listens to or reads multiple other things,

2032
02:01:03.210 --> 02:01:06.420
so I'm in the waiting room,
I'm finally waiting to see,

2033
02:01:06.421 --> 02:01:10.410
and the nurse comes out and before you go back to the,
to the clinic room,

2034
02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.810
like you have to get weighed,
that's just part of the protocol,
right?

2035
02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.420
So like they call my name.

2036
02:01:15.690 --> 02:01:20.400
So I walk up and I get on the scale and the nurse comes out in ways me and it's

2037
02:01:20.401 --> 02:01:24.930
like,
you know,
whatever,
two 10 and she's like,
congratulations.

2038
02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.850
And I'm like,
what?
She goes,
you're postsurgery right?
And I'm like,

2039
02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:34.770
no,
I'm here to be evaluated for surgery.
She like looks at me,

2040
02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:39.620
looks out at the waiting room where everybody is 400 pounds and like doesn't say

2041
02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:40.610
a word,

2042
02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.510
but the look in her eyes is basically like what the Hell is wrong with you?

2043
02:01:45.511 --> 02:01:45.980
That yeah,

2044
02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:50.480
<v 7>you got serious as your son,
but</v>

2045
02:01:52.670 --> 02:01:56.390
it seemed like a reasonable idea.
Very reasonable,
very reasonable.

2046
02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.560
You might want to check your reasonable ideas with me for future because that is

2047
02:02:01.821 --> 02:02:06.500
not a reasonable idea.
So you get done.
You don't do that surgery obviously.

2048
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:09.650
But what,
I had no patience for me.
What clicked in your brain?

2049
02:02:09.651 --> 02:02:11.930
Did you just all of a sudden say to yourself,
okay,
how is this happening?

2050
02:02:11.931 --> 02:02:16.680
And then you remembered your a and p class and said this is what's happening.

2051
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:20.240
<v 6>So I remember clear as day.
So,
uh,</v>

2052
02:02:20.650 --> 02:02:24.760
September 7th,

2053
02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:29.070
2009 I did,
uh,
I sort of did like one of these long swims a year.
You know,

2054
02:02:29.071 --> 02:02:30.610
you do a bunch of short ones,
a bunch of training,

2055
02:02:30.611 --> 02:02:32.230
but you always haven't had one main event.

2056
02:02:32.250 --> 02:02:36.880
My main event this year was I went back to Catalina Island and I wanted to swim

2057
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:39.400
from now la out to Catalina.

2058
02:02:39.401 --> 02:02:44.401
I had previously gone from Catalina to La and um,

2059
02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:50.140
it was tough swim.
I had a torn labrum,
so about six hours in,

2060
02:02:50.170 --> 02:02:53.740
you know,
it just became unbearable pain.
Um,

2061
02:02:53.770 --> 02:02:58.770
and you don't usually have a head current in the Catalina channel.

2062
02:02:59.201 --> 02:03:01.750
So the San Pedro Channel,
you know,
this,
you probably trained out there,

2063
02:03:01.870 --> 02:03:04.960
the currents usually running from point conception down or up.

2064
02:03:05.110 --> 02:03:07.420
So you usually have a little bit of a cross current and rare,

2065
02:03:07.450 --> 02:03:11.620
very rare to get anything back or forth.
And if anything,

2066
02:03:12.010 --> 02:03:14.350
it's generally a little bit towards the island.

2067
02:03:14.530 --> 02:03:19.530
And when I had swum four years earlier from Catalina to La,

2068
02:03:20.051 --> 02:03:21.670
it took 10 and a half hours.

2069
02:03:21.730 --> 02:03:24.280
But that was only 18 months after I learned how to swim.

2070
02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:30.180
I was a much better swimmer in 2009 and I was going in the theoretically faster

2071
02:03:30.431 --> 02:03:34.750
direction.
So a great example is expectations can kill you.

2072
02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:39.430
So I'm expecting this to be like a nine hour swim back.
And,

2073
02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:41.260
and really the only thing I'm thinking about,

2074
02:03:41.261 --> 02:03:44.050
which is the worst thing you think about in marathon swimming,
you should never,

2075
02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:47.200
ever,
ever think about how long this is going to take because you just,

2076
02:03:47.201 --> 02:03:49.570
you're just setting yourself up for misery.
The only real question has,

2077
02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:53.110
could I break nine hours?
You know,
I should be able to break nine hours.
Right?

2078
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:57.070
So to make a long story short,
I don't even come close.

2079
02:03:57.071 --> 02:04:00.550
This is a total disaster scenario.
The other thing you,

2080
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:05.760
you'll appreciate this just because you'll appreciate the stupidity.
Um,

2081
02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:10.540
you never want to look anywhere when you're swimming except down.
Um,

2082
02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:13.840
it's very demoralizing when you're in the middle.

2083
02:04:14.170 --> 02:04:15.430
Like if you're in the middle of the channel,

2084
02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:19.470
you don't see land from the water level.
You just,
you just don't.
So that's true.

2085
02:04:19.690 --> 02:04:23.860
So before you get on the water,
you tell the crew and every,

2086
02:04:23.861 --> 02:04:26.880
I've crew chief for a lot of great swimmers.
I mean,
it's the,
the,

2087
02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:31.660
the crew asks the swimmer,
what do you want?
What information do you want?

2088
02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:35.620
So we're starting to swim at midnight at point percent day.
I said,
okay,

2089
02:04:36.250 --> 02:04:37.083
I want to,

2090
02:04:37.410 --> 02:04:42.410
when there are exactly 10 miles to go and exactly four miles to go,

2091
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:47.670
what's the total distance of the swim?
Well,
as the crow flies,
it's 21 um,

2092
02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:50.790
and if so,
you don't have a current,
you're doing a 21 miles swim.

2093
02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:53.470
If you do have a current,
you're going to swim more than that.
So,

2094
02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:55.320
so that's why I said,
I said,
guys,

2095
02:04:55.410 --> 02:04:58.830
I want to know when there's tend to go and four to go.
Why tend to go?

2096
02:04:58.831 --> 02:05:03.120
You're just a little over halfway.
I'd like to just know that at four to go,

2097
02:05:03.150 --> 02:05:06.360
it's put your head down and swim for two hours.
Don't do anything.
You're there.

2098
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:10.470
So start the woman midnight.
This is in September,

2099
02:05:10.471 --> 02:05:13.950
so I forget what time the sun was rising back then,

2100
02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:18.480
but I knew that I would have tend to go before the sun came up.

2101
02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:21.330
So in other words,
I knew that once the light was up,

2102
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.730
I was going to be inside the 10 stretch.

2103
02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:28.020
And one of the most amazing things about swimming in the middle of the ocean.

2104
02:05:28.021 --> 02:05:31.920
I don't know if you've got to experience this during training is in the Pacific.

2105
02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:36.920
The bio luminescence is so strong and so on a clear night,

2106
02:05:37.050 --> 02:05:39.240
which I was always lucky to have every time I swam out.

2107
02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:40.320
I've done a lot of the channels,

2108
02:05:40.321 --> 02:05:42.660
swims every time I've been out there I've always been blessed with these clear

2109
02:05:42.661 --> 02:05:43.494
nights.

2110
02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:48.920
It's so dark cause once you get out of Las light under the water so your hand is

2111
02:05:50.041 --> 02:05:54.210
coming down,
you are seeing the bio luminescence flare off your hands.

2112
02:05:54.450 --> 02:05:58.350
When you breathe you were seeing the stars.
You can't tell the difference.

2113
02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:02.500
It is so dark.
You cannot see the difference between stars and bioluminescence.

2114
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:06.300
It's like being in this amazing chamber and so that's the,

2115
02:06:06.630 --> 02:06:08.970
that's the reward you get for swimming at night,

2116
02:06:08.971 --> 02:06:10.560
which is otherwise incredibly lonely.

2117
02:06:11.550 --> 02:06:14.880
And then the first thing you notice is the bio luminescence gets harder and

2118
02:06:14.881 --> 02:06:17.490
harder to see,
which means,
oh the sun's going to be up in an hour.

2119
02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:22.980
The Sun comes up.
Now the sun's like up there.
I haven't heard anything.

2120
02:06:22.981 --> 02:06:27.810
And I'm like,
those guys,
they forgot to tell me I've got 10 to go.

2121
02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:32.460
That's okay.
Probably down to six to go now.
And I'm swimming,
I'm swimming.

2122
02:06:32.461 --> 02:06:34.920
I'm assuming it must be like 10 o'clock in the,
I mean I'm being facetious,

2123
02:06:34.921 --> 02:06:39.270
it's probably like eight 30 in the morning and they're like 10 to go.

2124
02:06:39.690 --> 02:06:41.620
And I was like she's us.

2125
02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:47.340
And cause at that point I had no clue what the current was like cause a swimmer

2126
02:06:47.341 --> 02:06:50.520
can't feel current.
Right.
Just can only feel relative velocity,

2127
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:51.840
not absolute velocity.

2128
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:57.470
So you know that coupled with the torn labrum coupled with like it ended up

2129
02:06:58.201 --> 02:07:02.730
being over 14 hours of swimming and there's a very long story because your

2130
02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:05.100
question was so simple.
But I remember getting on the boat,

2131
02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:08.460
<v 7>I don't even remember what my question,
your question was about Patricia,</v>

2132
02:07:09.570 --> 02:07:13.110
about like when I finally decided this was the day that was over here in bio

2133
02:07:13.111 --> 02:07:17.310
luminescence.
Bill.
Okay.
So this is the day,

2134
02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:19.740
finished the swim,
get back back

2135
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:24.750
<v 6>to the boat and they've got like two burgers and two cokes waiting for me.</v>

2136
02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:27.700
And I mean like I couldn't have eaten those things quicker.

2137
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:31.860
Like the biggest juiciest burgers you've ever seen.
Like the cokes,

2138
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:35.110
like they tasted so good.
Right?
Because you know your mouth is so salty,

2139
02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:38.170
you actually really wants him to suite.
And my wife,

2140
02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:42.460
my wife hates when I tell this story cause she denies that she said it,

2141
02:07:42.461 --> 02:07:46.900
but she completely said it.
I'm just sitting there like raw.

2142
02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:49.510
I remember this,
I have a picture of the burger fatty.

2143
02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:54.270
I've got like a USA towel wrapped around my waist.
Inhaling,

2144
02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:55.960
I come to fisting Burgers,

2145
02:07:56.230 --> 02:07:59.770
drinking my cokes and she just looks at me and she goes,
and again,

2146
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:03.890
just in the sweetest way possible,
she said,
you,

2147
02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:07.850
you should probably work on being a little less,
not thin.

2148
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.233
Wow.

2149
02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:17.890
Is that like the kindest way to just tell somebody you're kind of getting a

2150
02:08:17.891 --> 02:08:20.850
little fat,
almost 14 hours swim?

2151
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:26.370
So that was the last time I had a coke.
Yeah.

2152
02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:30.010
I've never had a coke since.
Um,
and,

2153
02:08:30.011 --> 02:08:31.920
and all I did frankly at the time was just saying like,

2154
02:08:31.930 --> 02:08:34.630
I'm just going to try and experiment because I was like,
look,

2155
02:08:34.810 --> 02:08:37.390
at that time I still thought it was just calories in,
calories out.

2156
02:08:37.391 --> 02:08:40.000
I thought it was really just simple arithmetic and my view was,
all right,

2157
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:43.510
I can't do anything more on the calories outside.

2158
02:08:43.870 --> 02:08:45.370
There's only 168 hours in a week.

2159
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:49.240
I'm not willing to exercise more than 28 of them,
so calories out.

2160
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:51.550
I don't get to change that anymore.
And frankly,

2161
02:08:51.551 --> 02:08:54.460
I didn't really want to change the calories inside cause I hated being hungry

2162
02:08:54.461 --> 02:08:56.620
every time I tried to eat less,
I would just be so hungry.

2163
02:08:56.621 --> 02:08:58.450
I didn't know what to do with myself.
So I was like,

2164
02:08:58.451 --> 02:08:59.710
I'm going to try a new experiment.

2165
02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:03.100
What if it's the type of Calgary that might matter?

2166
02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:07.300
Sugar strikes me as not great for you,

2167
02:09:07.450 --> 02:09:12.070
even though I can't tell you why I'm going to stop having sugar.

2168
02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:14.620
So that was my first experiment in September of [inaudible] nine,

2169
02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:17.830
and that led to everything that's come since that time,

2170
02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:20.770
which obviously ultimately led to me coming back to medicine as well.

2171
02:09:21.110 --> 02:09:25.850
<v 4>Yeah.
And that's where you're at now.
And,
and,
and by the way,
um,</v>

2172
02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:28.730
listening to Tim Tim's podcast,

2173
02:09:28.731 --> 02:09:32.810
what else should people listen to to get all that nutritional information?

2174
02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:36.800
Does the rest of the story?
I think it's Sam's.

2175
02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:41.450
<v 6>Yeah.
I mean a couple of things with Tim.
Um,
I did a podcast with Chris Kresser,</v>

2176
02:09:41.690 --> 02:09:46.550
um,
earlier this year.
Talked about longevity a little bit.
I did one,

2177
02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:48.530
I did,
I probably have maybe,
Oh,
you know what?

2178
02:09:48.531 --> 02:09:49.640
Probably you get more into nutrition.

2179
02:09:49.810 --> 02:09:53.750
There's an IHMC video I did probably like three or four years ago.

2180
02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:57.710
<v 4>That one's like an hour long and you go pretty detailed in it.
Yup.
Okay.
Yeah,</v>

2181
02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:01.130
I've watched that one.
Yeah.
Yeah,
those are good.
Those are good.

2182
02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:05.660
And again,
if you had to kind of

2183
02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:10.010
tell people that aren't going to go listen to those podcasts,

2184
02:10:10.011 --> 02:10:14.500
aren't going to watch that,
that video,
what would you tell them?
You know,

2185
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:17.540
what would you tell him to eat overall?

2186
02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:24.030
<v 6>You know,
I generally don't like talking about nutrition because,
uh,</v>

2187
02:10:24.150 --> 02:10:26.970
and don't worry,
I will answer this question,
but I know at least preface it,

2188
02:10:26.971 --> 02:10:30.240
why I don't like it.
I don't like talking about this stuff.
Um,

2189
02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:37.180
nutrition is kind of a pseudoscience that masquerades as a religion for many

2190
02:10:38.481 --> 02:10:39.314
people.

2191
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:44.500
And so I find it difficult to have a discussion about biochemistry when it's so

2192
02:10:45.981 --> 02:10:49.550
cloaked in emotion,
religion,
and dogma.

2193
02:10:50.630 --> 02:10:53.930
Now that's not to say I don't have a strong point of view.
I certainly do.

2194
02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.430
It's also an evolving point of view.

2195
02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:58.800
I feel different today than I felt four or five years ago.
Uh,

2196
02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:00.560
feel different than I than I felt two years ago.

2197
02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:04.820
And also my life is one big experiment,
right?
So,
you know,

2198
02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:08.090
we were joking before I came in here and I've got a glucose meter buried within

2199
02:11:08.091 --> 02:11:08.721
me at the moment.

2200
02:11:08.721 --> 02:11:12.860
I've got like all these heart rate variability things like everything I'm doing.

2201
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:14.170
Actually,
let me just check them.

2202
02:11:15.630 --> 02:11:17.810
I actually did an experiment before I came here today.

2203
02:11:17.811 --> 02:11:22.610
I ate something and I want to see how much it raised my blood sugar.

2204
02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:26.993
What did you eat?

2205
02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:31.280
So I ate this product that I've been doing some research on.

2206
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:34.790
It's called no k,
n,
O,

2207
02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.620
w like no foods.

2208
02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:41.390
And I was introduced to this product by one of my patients who said,
Hey Peter,

2209
02:11:41.391 --> 02:11:46.100
I want you to kick the tires on this a little bit.
It's um,
it's,

2210
02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:51.160
it uses a sugar substitute called [inaudible] and it tastes amazing and

2211
02:11:51.501 --> 02:11:55.460
apparently like it doesn't raise your blood sugar at all.
And I was like,
yeah,

2212
02:11:55.461 --> 02:11:59.510
I'm familiar with Al yellows.
Uh,
for,
for those who might not know,

2213
02:11:59.570 --> 02:12:04.570
[inaudible] is a sugar that occurs in nature in very small quantities that looks

2214
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:10.850
exactly like this sugar called fructose,
which is fruit sugar,

2215
02:12:10.851 --> 02:12:14.180
the sweet component,
sugar with one small exception.

2216
02:12:14.570 --> 02:12:18.440
But that one small exception carries with it some very important things.
One,

2217
02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:21.800
it's not quite as sweet as fructose.
It's about 70% of sweet.

2218
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:24.110
But by giving up a little bit of that sweetness,

2219
02:12:24.111 --> 02:12:25.880
you get a whole bunch of stuff in return.
First of all,

2220
02:12:25.881 --> 02:12:29.480
it's not metabolized by the liver,
which is the real problem for it goes to,

2221
02:12:29.690 --> 02:12:30.860
you barely absorb it.

2222
02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:34.760
So 99% of it or more or less as excreted by the kidneys.

2223
02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:38.810
And three,
it actually seems to lower blood glucose.

2224
02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:41.540
So this company,

2225
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:46.570
no foods is putting this like making stuff out of this,

2226
02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:51.530
but stuff that is like carby like bread and waffles and muffins and stuff.

2227
02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:54.350
So anyway,
to make a long story short,

2228
02:12:54.351 --> 02:12:56.660
I met this patient's house and he's forced feeding me these things,

2229
02:12:56.661 --> 02:13:00.200
which is really my way of saying he's left the bag open and I'm inhaling them

2230
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:04.610
and he's like,
yeah,
you gotta,
you gotta like tell me if this stuff's legit.

2231
02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:05.850
So to make a long story short,

2232
02:13:05.851 --> 02:13:10.160
he plugs me into the guy who founded the company and he has sent me a bunch of

2233
02:13:10.161 --> 02:13:13.430
this stuff to just play with cause he knows what I do.

2234
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:17.300
And so that's what I've been doing.
So today I normally don't eat breakfast.

2235
02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:20.120
So I worked out this morning and then before I came here,

2236
02:13:20.121 --> 02:13:25.121
I had a big piece of their toast covered in almond butter and then two of their

2237
02:13:25.401 --> 02:13:28.670
huge waffles covered with almond butter and bananas.

2238
02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:30.230
Like I made a big sandwich out of that.

2239
02:13:30.590 --> 02:13:34.500
So the almond butter not going to have a huge glycaemic response because it's

2240
02:13:34.501 --> 02:13:35.700
got so much fat and protein in it,

2241
02:13:35.701 --> 02:13:37.920
but the bananas should skyrocket my blood sugar,

2242
02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:41.400
not to mention the two fricking waffles the size of my head and the piece of

2243
02:13:41.401 --> 02:13:43.560
toast.
So interestingly,

2244
02:13:43.590 --> 02:13:48.590
so that was at nine o'clock that I ate those and I've been up since three 30 but

2245
02:13:49.471 --> 02:13:52.470
I didn't eat anything.
I worked out from seven to eight.

2246
02:13:53.070 --> 02:13:55.050
So admittedly there's a bit of a glycogen debt.

2247
02:13:55.290 --> 02:14:00.290
So at nine o'clock when I ingested my blood glucose was 65 and at its peak,

2248
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:08.990
which was 11:18 AM it was up to 90 and it's now down to 83 what would real

2249
02:14:09.961 --> 02:14:11.160
waffles have done to you?

2250
02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:16.220
I think they would have sent me to like one 43 huge pieces of bread slash waffle

2251
02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.050
with the full banana.
So anyway,
I've been doing these experiments all week,

2252
02:14:22.051 --> 02:14:25.020
which is just a great excuse to eat this stuff and I'm kind of actually

2253
02:14:25.021 --> 02:14:28.770
surprised.
I'm kind of blown away.
So,
okay.
With all that said,

2254
02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:30.510
what's my advice for what people should eat?

2255
02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:37.080
In an ideal world,
everybody would have this thing embedded in them.
Like I do.

2256
02:14:37.290 --> 02:14:42.080
This thing is called a Dexcom g five.
It's a continuous glucose monitor.
Um,

2257
02:14:43.330 --> 02:14:46.950
typically only used by people with type one diabetes.
Um,

2258
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:50.820
we're now starting to see people with type two diabetes where them,
but,
um,

2259
02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:55.910
I was really completely lucky one day sitting on an airplane next to a dude who

2260
02:14:56.071 --> 02:14:59.580
happened to be into watches.
I'm into watches,
we got talking about watches.

2261
02:14:59.610 --> 02:15:02.040
I find out he's the CEO of the company that makes this thing.

2262
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:05.370
The rest is history,
right?
I'm like obsessed with this stuff.

2263
02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:10.050
And so because the answer is this,
right?

2264
02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:11.580
If you were a computer program,

2265
02:15:11.581 --> 02:15:16.581
I would say Jocko eat whatever you want to eat such that your average blood

2266
02:15:16.921 --> 02:15:21.921
glucose remains below 85 milligrams per deciliter and your standard deviation

2267
02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:27.480
below 10 milligrams per deciliter.
So translate that into English.
Okay.

2268
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:32.600
So eat in whatever way your genetics and epigenetics permit you to such that

2269
02:15:33.211 --> 02:15:38.211
your glucose levels stay low and the variability stays low and those two things

2270
02:15:39.421 --> 02:15:41.610
will ensure that your insulin levels stay low.

2271
02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:46.020
So what I'm trying to do is optimize for something called the insulin AUC or

2272
02:15:46.021 --> 02:15:49.590
area under the curve than we can't measure that test clinically.

2273
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:51.780
Only I could measure that.
It's put you in a hospital,

2274
02:15:52.050 --> 02:15:55.080
put a central line in your neck and excuse me,

2275
02:15:55.081 --> 02:15:59.220
sample your blood every 30 minutes over the course of a day where you somehow

2276
02:15:59.221 --> 02:16:03.360
act normally and every day.
So then I'd have a time axis y axis,

2277
02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:04.800
the x axis to be time.

2278
02:16:04.801 --> 02:16:08.520
The Y axis would be insulin level and we generate a curve and we'd calculate the

2279
02:16:08.521 --> 02:16:12.390
area under that curve and we want that number to be as low as possible.

2280
02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:15.180
So we can't do that outside of the research setting.

2281
02:16:15.210 --> 02:16:20.100
So then the next best thing is keep your average glucose is low as possible and

2282
02:16:20.101 --> 02:16:20.881
the variability.

2283
02:16:20.881 --> 02:16:25.680
So you could have an average glucose of a hundred with low variability.

2284
02:16:25.890 --> 02:16:29.280
And that actually wouldn't produce that much insulin or you could have a glucose

2285
02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:34.000
of a hundred with high variability,
same average glucose,

2286
02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:37.000
higher variability is going to have higher insulin,
all things equal.

2287
02:16:37.450 --> 02:16:42.450
So just through empirical testing in myself over the past year and a half,

2288
02:16:43.090 --> 02:16:48.090
I've realized that an average blood glucose and this thing tells me every time I

2289
02:16:48.281 --> 02:16:51.610
hit click,
like it gives me my last 14 days,

2290
02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:56.290
I just realized like for my average to be below 85 and my standard deviation to

2291
02:16:56.291 --> 02:16:59.290
be below 10 is like super dialed in.

2292
02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:05.280
So what you can eat to achieve that varies tremendously by individual.

2293
02:17:06.190 --> 02:17:09.210
Um,
you know,
there are some people who just dispose of glucose remarkably.

2294
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:14.220
So that blood tests we're going to do next week is going to be our best test at

2295
02:17:14.231 --> 02:17:17.050
measuring that.
Um,
and so,

2296
02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:22.030
so glucose disposal is as mostly a function of the insulin sensitivity of the

2297
02:17:22.031 --> 02:17:26.830
muscle because the muscle is where we dispose of the majority of glucose.

2298
02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:31.900
Um,
but it's more a little more complicated than that.
Right?
Sleep impacts that.

2299
02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:32.831
Right?

2300
02:17:32.831 --> 02:17:37.831
So sleep deprivation makes us more insulin resistant though.

2301
02:17:38.381 --> 02:17:42.040
This has been experimentally demonstrated even with two weeks of sleep

2302
02:17:42.041 --> 02:17:43.030
deprivation.
So there's a,

2303
02:17:43.570 --> 02:17:47.590
it's a small but very well controlled experiment that was done out of the

2304
02:17:47.590 --> 02:17:49.510
University of Chicago price six years ago.

2305
02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:53.290
They took a very small number of subjects,
like I said,
about eight subjects,

2306
02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:57.610
and for two weeks let them only sleep four hours a night.

2307
02:17:57.790 --> 02:17:59.360
And they did,
um,

2308
02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:03.070
a very invasive tests called a euglycemic insulin clamp at the beginning.

2309
02:18:03.071 --> 02:18:07.810
And at the end of the experiment and their insulin sensitivity,

2310
02:18:07.811 --> 02:18:10.690
their glucose disposal deteriorated by 50%,

2311
02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:16.090
and with no change in what they were eating.
So,
um,

2312
02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:20.530
so it's highly variable,
right?
So that's theoretically the answer.

2313
02:18:20.590 --> 02:18:24.610
On a practical level,
I would say the answer is this,
right?

2314
02:18:25.390 --> 02:18:30.310
If it comes in a package,
you're probably better off not eating it,
right?

2315
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:31.240
Um,

2316
02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:36.240
if your ancestors couldn't have eaten this even 200 years ago,

2317
02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:38.650
it's probably not worth eating.

2318
02:18:39.670 --> 02:18:42.250
So if you just follow that advice,

2319
02:18:42.670 --> 02:18:46.450
think about how many things you'd eliminate from your diet,
right?

2320
02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:50.410
If you just took packaged foods away from your diet.
And again,

2321
02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.470
notice I'm agnostic.
You want to be a Vegan,
knock yourself out.

2322
02:18:53.471 --> 02:18:56.920
Do you want to be the Paleo Man of the century?
Go for it.
I don't give a shit.

2323
02:18:57.190 --> 02:19:00.190
Okay.
Like I couldn't care less.
Right.

2324
02:19:00.430 --> 02:19:03.040
But if you can largely adhere to those principles,

2325
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:05.800
you're kind of going to be fine.
Do you want,
you know,

2326
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:09.250
you're going to get 70% of the way there.
You want to get 80,
90,

2327
02:19:09.251 --> 02:19:12.700
100% of the way there.
Yeah.
Well then there's no simple answer.
Now at that point,

2328
02:19:12.701 --> 02:19:17.260
you got to dial in and you gotta go full immersion into how do you tweak to your

2329
02:19:17.261 --> 02:19:22.000
biochemistry?
How much protein,
what's the timing of the meals?
When do we fast?

2330
02:19:22.001 --> 02:19:24.720
I mean,
all of the stuff that,
uh,
is,

2331
02:19:24.810 --> 02:19:28.150
is my world and maybe soon to be your,
uh,

2332
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:33.140
<v 3>that,
that's,
um,
that's the,
that's the stuff for which you cannot provide,</v>

2333
02:19:33.170 --> 02:19:36.920
you know,
systemic advice.
But at the,
at the societal level or at the,

2334
02:19:36.921 --> 02:19:40.610
just the most basic level.
Yeah.
I mean,
think about that advice.
Like,
you don't,

2335
02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:44.120
you don't eat sugar anymore.
You won't eat refined carbohydrates anymore.

2336
02:19:44.121 --> 02:19:47.090
You're not going to eat,
you know,
processed crappy foods anymore.

2337
02:19:47.091 --> 02:19:48.770
What are you going to eat?
You're gonna eat fruits,

2338
02:19:48.771 --> 02:19:50.540
you're going to eat vegetables,
you're going to eat meat,

2339
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:53.450
you're going to eat grains.
You know,
what kind of grades are you going to eat?

2340
02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:54.950
Well,
you know,
you're,
you're,
you know,

2341
02:19:54.951 --> 02:19:57.830
you're not going to really eat these sort of refined crappy grains that people

2342
02:19:57.831 --> 02:20:00.260
that you're going to,
you know,
your,
your starches,
I'm sorry,
not grades.

2343
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:04.790
Your starches are probably gonna be in the form of potatoes and rice.
So Again,

2344
02:20:04.791 --> 02:20:06.680
a lot of pee.
You know,
I just,
I sort of,

2345
02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:10.070
I think the reason I'm only talking about nutrition anymore is I don't find it

2346
02:20:10.071 --> 02:20:12.530
to be at an intellectually honest discussion anymore.

2347
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:16.070
I find it to be just a discussion of dogma,
right?
So if you're a low carb camp,

2348
02:20:16.071 --> 02:20:20.120
you're a low carb camp.
If you're in the,
you know,
whatever the Vegan camp,

2349
02:20:20.121 --> 02:20:21.520
you're in the Vegan camp,
like there's the,

2350
02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:23.930
you can't even have a discussion about this stuff.

2351
02:20:24.410 --> 02:20:28.580
And at least not with most people.
So I just,
you know,

2352
02:20:28.970 --> 02:20:32.510
you ever read the book called Diet Cults?
Uh,
no.

2353
02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:36.970
So does it get into this nonsense?
That's the whole book really.

2354
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:41.060
So interesting.
Fond to read.
Oh good.
All right.

2355
02:20:41.061 --> 02:20:42.020
We'll have to check that out.

2356
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:44.990
And I called now kind of open with us and since we're,

2357
02:20:46.310 --> 02:20:49.140
since we're a little over two hours right now,
uh,

2358
02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:55.300
I said that you're probably the most responsible individual for this podcast and

2359
02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:03.720
because you originally through Kirk,
uh,

2360
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:07.340
sent me up to do a podcast with Tim Ferriss,

2361
02:21:07.341 --> 02:21:11.600
which sent me up to do a podcast with Joe Rogan,
which was just all awesome.

2362
02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:13.880
And both those guys told me I should do my own podcast.

2363
02:21:13.881 --> 02:21:17.840
So anyone that's listening to this podcast say thanks to Peter for that.

2364
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:22.700
Actually they should thank Kirk,
right?
Because,
and Kirk was the man,
you know,

2365
02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:27.260
I mean Kirk is,
I don't need to tell you,
but Kirk's one of those guys were like,

2366
02:21:27.261 --> 02:21:32.180
he doesn't have to justify an ask.
Right.
So when he introduced me to you,

2367
02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:35.330
he didn't have to explain.
He was just like,
I want you to meet Jocko.

2368
02:21:35.331 --> 02:21:38.410
Jocko is my friend.
I was like,
that's good enough.
And so in a,

2369
02:21:38.570 --> 02:21:42.560
to me like that's the measure of when life is good and because I feel that way

2370
02:21:42.561 --> 02:21:45.050
with all of my friends.
Like if Tim introduces me to somebody,

2371
02:21:45.051 --> 02:21:48.170
like Tim's introduced me to like a dozen people that does an amazing

2372
02:21:48.171 --> 02:21:52.580
relationships have come out of that.
Right.
And so,
you know,
you know,

2373
02:21:52.581 --> 02:21:56.570
really it was just very easy for me to sort of take Kirk on his word that like

2374
02:21:56.600 --> 02:21:59.120
if you know,
Jack has great guide,
then that's,
that's all I needed to know.

2375
02:21:59.121 --> 02:22:01.370
I knew you were going to be a great guy.
And then similarly,

2376
02:22:01.371 --> 02:22:04.760
like I could tell Tim like,
hey,
you gotta meet Jocko and,
and you know,

2377
02:22:04.761 --> 02:22:09.650
Tim gets quote unquote pitched all day long,
but you know,

2378
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:10.780
he knows that I'm,

2379
02:22:10.890 --> 02:22:14.480
I'm not going to send them somebody that's not going to be really interesting

2380
02:22:14.481 --> 02:22:17.680
and going to benefit his listeners,
not just,
you know,

2381
02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:21.580
whatever agenda that person might have.
Yeah,
no,
it was awesome.

2382
02:22:21.581 --> 02:22:25.860
And that that really did,
I mean the way Tim,
you're way Tim

2383
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:30.390
<v 5>advised the way he was going to release the podcast in order to support them in</v>

2384
02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:31.890
bulk.
I mean he just nailed it.

2385
02:22:31.891 --> 02:22:36.891
It was kind of ridiculous the way he understands that stuff and how helpful it

2386
02:22:37.051 --> 02:22:40.830
was to,
you know,
get in our book out there and getting it sold and,

2387
02:22:40.890 --> 02:22:44.130
and all that and getting all these people on board.
And then,
you know,

2388
02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:46.950
that turned it into this podcast,
which,
you know,
he,

2389
02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:50.970
he definitely has promoted the podcast and a fantastic way along with Joe.

2390
02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:52.980
So that's both been awesome.
But again,

2391
02:22:53.350 --> 02:22:57.180
started with Kirk connected me with you and then you connected me with Tim.
So,

2392
02:22:57.181 --> 02:22:58.920
uh,
appreciate that.

2393
02:22:59.610 --> 02:23:02.460
And I'm speaking to this podcast,

2394
02:23:03.690 --> 02:23:07.980
my almost silent partner over here that go,
Charles,

2395
02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:11.670
if somebody wants to support the podcast,

2396
02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:17.310
how would you recommend they go ahead and do that?
You'll always have a question.

2397
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.820
Oh,
oh.
How'd you hurt your back or regionally?

2398
02:23:21.810 --> 02:23:24.940
<v 3>No,
I don't think we ever really have a diagnosis.</v>

2399
02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:28.420
There were certainly nothing on that day that I did that day.

2400
02:23:28.421 --> 02:23:32.520
I'm riding my bike to the,
to the gym.
I,
you know,

2401
02:23:32.530 --> 02:23:35.800
I think about the sins of my youth.
Um,
you know,

2402
02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:41.040
I was really into martial arts in addition to boxing and I used to spend a ton

2403
02:23:41.950 --> 02:23:45.480
of time,
um,
I was really obsessed with spinning back kicks.

2404
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:47.970
Now I don't know if that could have done it or not.
I,

2405
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:53.560
but I used to practice 75 spinning back kicks with each leg every single day for

2406
02:23:53.561 --> 02:23:57.880
probably about six years,
seven years.
Um,
it's possible,

2407
02:23:57.881 --> 02:24:00.220
even though in theory a spinning back kick,
if done correctly,

2408
02:24:00.221 --> 02:24:02.830
should really not put any torque on the lower back.

2409
02:24:02.831 --> 02:24:06.610
It's much more in your hips and technically the flexibilities in the thoracic

2410
02:24:06.611 --> 02:24:08.950
spine,
not the lumbar spine,
but you know,
God knows,

2411
02:24:08.951 --> 02:24:11.580
maybe I just wasn't doing those things correctly.
Um,

2412
02:24:12.130 --> 02:24:14.200
I did squat and dead lift really heavy growing up.

2413
02:24:14.201 --> 02:24:18.160
I did power lifting as sort of a side sport,
but you know,

2414
02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:22.960
certainly never hurt myself doing that.
I rowed crew for a year.

2415
02:24:23.350 --> 02:24:24.760
And so I always,

2416
02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:28.150
I've always wondered if that was the most destructive thing I did because I'm in

2417
02:24:28.151 --> 02:24:30.820
an eight man boat.
It's eight your asymmetric,
right?

2418
02:24:30.821 --> 02:24:34.780
So when you scull your symmetric,
when you sweep your not,
and so I was like,

2419
02:24:35.290 --> 02:24:36.130
I was a sweeper.

2420
02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:39.970
And so I almost wonder if like that's the most destructive thing I ever did.

2421
02:24:39.971 --> 02:24:40.360
Yeah.

2422
02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:45.040
And then you figure if you're asymmetric lake that your everyday life is

2423
02:24:45.041 --> 02:24:48.480
asymmetric really.
Cause you have a little bit of over developmental insight.

2424
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:51.190
It might have been.
So I guess I'd never really known,

2425
02:24:51.191 --> 02:24:54.340
but I take it really seriously today.
In fact,
you know,
Jocko,
you'll dig this.

2426
02:24:56.170 --> 02:25:01.170
Two weeks ago I did a video in New York with a friend of mine named Jessie

2427
02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:06.100
Schwartzman and uh,
he's like,
I call him the savant of movement.
It's guys like,

2428
02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:09.900
just like the kinesthetic man.
And,
um,

2429
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.920
I wanted to put a video together of how do you train to train,

2430
02:25:14.921 --> 02:25:18.970
how do you prepare your body to train?
So it's basically three sections.
It's,
um,

2431
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:20.710
what,
uh,
what,

2432
02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:24.640
what's the sort of dynamic while the sort of tissue preparation,

2433
02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:26.560
the static prep and the dynamic prep?

2434
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:30.670
It took us eight [inaudible] maybe six hours to shoot this video.

2435
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.810
It'll be edited down into probably three 10 minute videos.

2436
02:25:35.050 --> 02:25:36.100
And as soon as they're done editing,

2437
02:25:36.101 --> 02:25:37.930
I'm just gonna throw them up on youtube and my blog.

2438
02:25:37.931 --> 02:25:42.520
So I'll make sure you've got a copy.
It's,
it's,
it's,
uh,
I mean Jesse is just,
uh,

2439
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:44.800
you know,
he walks me through all the exercises,

2440
02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:48.730
but I get the sense like if I had done that stuff all the way in my life,

2441
02:25:48.731 --> 02:25:51.040
I probably never would have been hurt.
And luckily,
knock on wood to this day,

2442
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:51.874
I mean,

2443
02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:55.420
I never thought I'd be able to squat and dead lift again after going through

2444
02:25:55.421 --> 02:25:59.230
that year of my life.
But amazingly,
I,
I'm totally fine.

2445
02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:02.250
And who's a herniated disk that popped off?
Yeah,

2446
02:26:02.290 --> 02:26:06.750
so it was an l five s one really big herniation,
but then,
uh,

2447
02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:10.930
four or five centimeter fragment broke off and then floats down the canal and

2448
02:26:10.931 --> 02:26:12.160
that was sitting on the nerve root.

2449
02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:14.590
And then I developed a few other problems after.

2450
02:26:14.591 --> 02:26:17.170
So I developed this thing called a fossette arthropathy,

2451
02:26:17.171 --> 02:26:21.820
which resulted in the feeling of having my testicles torn out from the inside.

2452
02:26:22.570 --> 02:26:25.210
I'm not even joking.
That's just so it's just unbearable.

2453
02:26:25.730 --> 02:26:30.240
<v 8>Yeah,
I would imagine that's unbearable.
I don't recommend that.
No.
All right.</v>

2454
02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:34.670
Um,
well that being said,

2455
02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:39.140
I guess we can talk about some so you can talk about on it.

2456
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:44.750
I was talking with Greg and Terry [inaudible] and I was showing them about,

2457
02:26:44.890 --> 02:26:48.320
uh,
I was showing him the warrior bars.
Right,
right.
These are,
these are dope.

2458
02:26:48.321 --> 02:26:51.020
And then,
then he was like,
oh yeah,
like what else is there?

2459
02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:55.310
There's some good songs as good stuff.
So I brought out the new preworkout one,

2460
02:26:56.060 --> 02:27:00.380
which is good,
by the way.
I have a report on that.
So that one comes out and then,

2461
02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:02.600
uh,
the Krill oil comes out.
Oh yeah,
this is good for this.

2462
02:27:02.601 --> 02:27:05.570
So we're talking about this,
this big table,
like all the sub,
it's not a lot.

2463
02:27:05.571 --> 02:27:10.550
It's like four things that worry bar cause of Krill oil and the preworkout and,

2464
02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:14.570
uh,
three things.
And we're like,
yeah,
this does this and this does this.

2465
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:17.390
And then I kind of stepped back and I'm like,
yeah,

2466
02:27:17.391 --> 02:27:20.570
we're those guys with all our supplements talking about supplements,

2467
02:27:20.571 --> 02:27:24.350
talking about supplements,
right.
Which I've never done.
And Greg goes,
yeah,

2468
02:27:24.351 --> 02:27:27.740
if we weren't such nice guys,
this would be a real douchey conversation.

2469
02:27:28.190 --> 02:27:33.190
So the kind of the irony there is him saying that he's the one having the

2470
02:27:35.361 --> 02:27:40.340
douchey conversation,
but he is the nice guy.
You get it.

2471
02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:42.180
I guess.
So anyway,

2472
02:27:43.180 --> 02:27:46.680
point there or actually the second point there is on it is good supplements.

2473
02:27:46.681 --> 02:27:48.960
So if you do talk about it while you're taking them,

2474
02:27:48.961 --> 02:27:51.150
you're not having a douchey conversation.

2475
02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:55.260
And this is why I heard Joe Rogan talking the other day about how hard it is

2476
02:27:55.261 --> 02:27:58.290
when you're a standup comedian and you tell a joke and it just flat.

2477
02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:01.200
I think we just got,
here's the thing,

2478
02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:06.390
just getting your mercy last night I didn't do it because I'm not a merciful

2479
02:28:06.391 --> 02:28:08.820
person that had joking elements.

2480
02:28:08.821 --> 02:28:12.570
But this is true in this part of the bigger point that I'm making.
I hope so.

2481
02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:19.210
Everything I say,
even though you pretty much do
anyway.

2482
02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:22.970
The reason that,
not a douchey conversation.
Here's the point,

2483
02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:26.360
is because on it supplements the Krill oil,

2484
02:28:26.361 --> 02:28:30.560
all that stuff is actually good quality.
It's not like,
Hey,
I'm going to meet it,

2485
02:28:30.561 --> 02:28:34.370
I'm gonna get buff and all this stuff.
It actually helps your performance anyway,

2486
02:28:34.970 --> 02:28:39.290
so in the event of you wanting on it stuff and supporting this podcast,

2487
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:44.960
while@thesametimesupportingyourselfgoingonat.com slash Jocko 10% off,
boom.

2488
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:51.110
Second way to support Amazon,
click through Christmas is over,

2489
02:28:51.290 --> 02:28:56.240
but we still need stuff,
duct tape,
whatever,
nice,

2490
02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:59.570
et cetera.
Um,
if you want to support this podcast,

2491
02:28:59.571 --> 02:29:03.090
just go to the website chocolate podcast.com.
Click through the

2492
02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:07.730
Amazon banner link before you do your shopping.

2493
02:29:08.810 --> 02:29:11.480
You can support that way.
It's a good way to support,

2494
02:29:13.690 --> 02:29:16.670
oh wait,
yeah,
you're into chemistry,
right?
Sodium,

2495
02:29:16.671 --> 02:29:19.700
when you put a little piece of sodium in the water,
right?

2496
02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:20.930
It makes this big commotion.

2497
02:29:20.931 --> 02:29:23.540
So that's what kind of what the Amazon Click through does.

2498
02:29:23.570 --> 02:29:27.950
It seems like the small little thing but applied properly,

2499
02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:31.550
it makes a big impact in the podcast support wise.
Anyway.

2500
02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:33.800
I thought you'd get to reverify that doctor,

2501
02:29:34.580 --> 02:29:36.740
I will have to go and look at the Amazon Click through.

2502
02:29:39.350 --> 02:29:42.650
I tell Jack that he typically doesn't really understand cause he doesn't know

2503
02:29:42.651 --> 02:29:46.940
what sodium does.
No,
it might've been potassium or both actually.

2504
02:29:47.650 --> 02:29:49.480
So now this whole thing has been a lie.

2505
02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:54.080
I'm sure not and I'm pretty sure I haven't actually fairly surgeon.

2506
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:58.550
Pretty sure it goes a long way with that girl I guess.
Anyway,

2507
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:02.480
you can subscribe to the podcast on Itunes,

2508
02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:06.320
which seems obvious cause typically the podcasts you listened to,

2509
02:30:06.321 --> 02:30:08.750
you subscribed to,
but sometimes you don't.

2510
02:30:08.751 --> 02:30:13.670
So subscribe if you have not already and you want to support this podcast,

2511
02:30:14.390 --> 02:30:19.280
Google play,
stitcher also in the game.
Yeah.
And iTunes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2512
02:30:19.281 --> 02:30:21.950
It's kind of unfair that I don't think about that as much.

2513
02:30:21.951 --> 02:30:24.640
You know when you have an iPhone and I can kind of forget all this other stuff,

2514
02:30:24.641 --> 02:30:29.240
we're here to help out.
Yeah man.
Good thing you're here on this podcast.

2515
02:30:29.650 --> 02:30:34.650
A Youtube of course working on putting more videos on there aside from the whole

2516
02:30:36.231 --> 02:30:37.064
podcast.

2517
02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:42.560
So some of those videos and I have gotten like messages saying like those

2518
02:30:42.561 --> 02:30:45.400
shorter clips are helpful.
They are,
you know,

2519
02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:50.360
rather than listening to the podcast people that have been submitting to you on

2520
02:30:50.361 --> 02:30:55.130
Twitter,
which excerpts yeah.
Are in high demand out there in the world.

2521
02:30:55.610 --> 02:31:00.340
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've been following now and in fact to have them all like it's a,

2522
02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:03.710
it's a process,
but yeah,
we're working on that.
So subscribe to Youtube.

2523
02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:08.630
We are working on that.
We are collective just so you guys know,

2524
02:31:08.631 --> 02:31:11.090
I'm not working on any of that,
but echo and buried vias,

2525
02:31:11.091 --> 02:31:14.670
which is cool technically you saying,
hey,
I put this one.
Okay.

2526
02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:20.070
Yeah man.
Exactly.
Um,
and then in the event of you wearing like what?

2527
02:31:20.071 --> 02:31:23.700
Like a t shirt or something or a hoodie.
Jocko has this store,

2528
02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:28.850
it's called Jocko store.
The URL is Jocko store economics of it.

2529
02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:32.100
Is that a calculator?
Watch you though.
I was going to get to that.

2530
02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:35.190
So you mentioned,
see now we've got to change the subject real quick,

2531
02:31:35.191 --> 02:31:39.750
which I like.
By the way,
remember you were talking about your into watches,
right?

2532
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:43.560
I was going to shut,
I didn't want to interrupt what you're saying,
but that is,

2533
02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:48.000
I appreciate that.
That is re Dick Hillis.

2534
02:31:48.210 --> 02:31:52.290
I just reincorporated uh,
this one back because what is it,
our calculator watch?

2535
02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:56.700
Actually one of the first pictures I posted on Twitter was up before the enemy

2536
02:31:56.701 --> 02:31:59.090
and it was like,
you know,
Jack was always like,
yeah,

2537
02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:02.010
4:30 AM which one is at the Casio a Casio

2538
02:32:03.930 --> 02:32:08.930
circa 1984 85 that watch when I was a kid.

2539
02:32:09.661 --> 02:32:14.520
Dude,
like
for that,
only the cool kids had the calculator one.

2540
02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:18.770
Usually if you had to watch it was just the regular Casio and the cool kids had

2541
02:32:18.771 --> 02:32:19.604
the Kalki

2542
02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:23.700
<v 6>first iron man.
Did you?
Yeah,</v>

2543
02:32:23.900 --> 02:32:28.170
it was black with a leg,
a little red trim on it.
I asked for it for Christmas.

2544
02:32:28.530 --> 02:32:31.350
My parents got it for me,
but I knew where they had presence.

2545
02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:33.330
Every day after school.

2546
02:32:33.331 --> 02:32:38.220
I would go into their room and I would take it out of the box I had set the time

2547
02:32:38.221 --> 02:32:39.240
I would wear it.

2548
02:32:39.570 --> 02:32:43.590
I would just hang out there and then before I go to bed I would like sneak pack,

2549
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:47.280
put it in and so like on Christmas Day it was like I'd been wearing a watch for

2550
02:32:47.281 --> 02:32:51.290
a month.
Right.
Those you're watching actually,
I think you got it.

2551
02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:57.040
Yeah.
Well I got one actually got,
I got quite a few of these shotguns.

2552
02:32:57.110 --> 02:33:01.110
You should have your own brand of watch and we'll see how all that turns out.

2553
02:33:01.170 --> 02:33:04.380
Yeah.
Nonetheless.
Yeah.

2554
02:33:04.381 --> 02:33:06.420
I am very proud of this calculator watch.

2555
02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:12.020
<v 8>It's back to the store though.
Jocko store.
No watches,
but yeah,
yeah,</v>

2556
02:33:12.021 --> 02:33:15.770
our yet.
Yeah.
Not yet.
But there are some cool shirts in my opinion.

2557
02:33:15.771 --> 02:33:18.820
I think they're cool.
Discipline equals freedom,
all these things.
Chocolates,

2558
02:33:18.821 --> 02:33:20.840
head good,
written in backwards.

2559
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:25.970
Various layers to the shirts.
Not just like,
oh,
picture.
That's it.

2560
02:33:27.890 --> 02:33:31.430
So if you like any of that stuff,

2561
02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:34.280
I'm not even saying go buy this stuff.
I'm not saying that.

2562
02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:38.150
Just go to the chocolate store.com.
See if you like it.
If you like it,

2563
02:33:38.151 --> 02:33:40.940
you want one thing,
you buy one and that's the of the podcast.

2564
02:33:42.210 --> 02:33:47.210
You know it's a systemic thing.
Good.
There you go.

2565
02:33:47.211 --> 02:33:48.200
Patches on there as well.

2566
02:33:48.201 --> 02:33:51.800
Rash guards or shirts or you know what you didn't mention that you should have

2567
02:33:51.801 --> 02:33:54.770
mentioned cause apparently it's been pretty cool out there in the world.

2568
02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:57.140
Laid on me.
Psychological warfare.

2569
02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:02.660
Yeah I didn't mention it this time but I mentioned it last time and in my

2570
02:34:02.661 --> 02:34:05.780
everyday life and I use it so there you go.

2571
02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:11.360
Psychological warfare,
you use it.
I use it every day when needed.

2572
02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:13.700
Here's the thing,
you can't use it every day.

2573
02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.120
We didn't know you can't actually you can't,

2574
02:34:15.121 --> 02:34:18.130
I'm not gonna say you can't use it everyday,
but reason,
the whole

2575
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:22.240
<v 4>reason that I was like,
Hey Jocko,
what do you say?
You know when you're,</v>

2576
02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:27.550
I need it everyday.
But it varies from season to season.

2577
02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:33.180
So like personally if you are coming up against moments of weakness.

2578
02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:38.710
Yup.
We have a little method to get you over those humps.
Yeah.

2579
02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:44.520
It's kind of like coaching a little bit because you didn't go pathic coaching

2580
02:34:45.220 --> 02:34:49.900
cycle for sure.
It cause it kind of at the state for,

2581
02:34:49.901 --> 02:34:52.420
I played one of them for my seven year old daughter the other day because she

2582
02:34:52.421 --> 02:34:54.820
was about to eat some candy or something.
I was like come here for a minute.

2583
02:34:55.230 --> 02:34:59.390
So I played her that one.
You know the snack time one?
Yep.
Sugarcoated science.

2584
02:34:59.530 --> 02:35:02.620
Yeah.
Sugarcoated lies.
She was,
she was pretty impressed.

2585
02:35:02.621 --> 02:35:06.400
But what impressed me was later in the evening she was kind of saying it.
Yeah.

2586
02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:11.730
See and that's what I was going to say,
where you explain,
it's like cool,

2587
02:35:11.731 --> 02:35:15.070
it's Jocko telling me to do this.
So yes I'll do it or not do it or whatever.

2588
02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:19.690
But you explained some,
some,
some good stuff like to remember,

2589
02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:24.220
you know like the news sugarcoated lives and that's kind of catchy too,

2590
02:35:24.221 --> 02:35:25.390
so it sticks in your mind.

2591
02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:31.300
So you can buy that on iTunes.
It's somewhere else too,
right?

2592
02:35:31.330 --> 02:35:32.770
Google play if you want it,

2593
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:37.630
and also everyone that asks for an alarm tone to wake up.
That's it.
That's it.

2594
02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:39.370
It's there now.
Don't have to ask anymore.

2595
02:35:39.430 --> 02:35:42.460
You can just go to iTunes and get that psychological or clear with your wife or

2596
02:35:42.461 --> 02:35:46.410
whoever you sleep with.
Yeah,
we've gotten some serious feedback on that one.
Yeah,

2597
02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:50.110
because what happens is the alarm goes off.
If you have it set,

2598
02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:53.680
then it's going to be my voice and it's gonna be weird because it sounds like

2599
02:35:53.681 --> 02:35:56.380
there's some strange man in your room till four 30 in the morning,

2600
02:35:56.470 --> 02:36:00.930
which is kind of weird.
Lonely work at 4:30 AM like,

2601
02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:04.610
no,
it's just,
it's just a,
it's just a,
it's an album.
It's a,

2602
02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:09.620
it's an album of tracks and each track talks about some moment of week,

2603
02:36:12.010 --> 02:36:13.570
generally a moment of weakness that you have.

2604
02:36:13.571 --> 02:36:18.370
Like there's ones to wake up in the morning.
There's ones too.
You know what?

2605
02:36:18.371 --> 02:36:20.710
You don't feel like going to the gym,
go to the gym.

2606
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:25.770
There's ones you feel like eat a donut,
don't eat the donut.
There's one element.

2607
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:28.330
I'm going to put this off for a while,
I'm going to procrastinate.
No,

2608
02:36:28.331 --> 02:36:29.290
you're not going to procrastinate.

2609
02:36:29.410 --> 02:36:33.790
So all the little moments of weakness that we all have as humans can be

2610
02:36:33.791 --> 02:36:37.400
countered using psychological warfare.
You actually,
yeah,

2611
02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:39.820
there's definitely two on there.
There's one called,

2612
02:36:40.030 --> 02:36:43.280
I think it's called like no more.
It's basically like,
I'm not doing this anymore.

2613
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:44.440
No more a good one.

2614
02:36:44.470 --> 02:36:49.000
That one's good because it puts into words exactly like what you want to think.

2615
02:36:49.001 --> 02:36:51.220
Like,
you know,
cause you always feel that like,
you know how like,

2616
02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:53.080
you know you're gaining some weight or,

2617
02:36:53.081 --> 02:36:55.870
I mean a lot of times you know why you're gaining weight and so it's little bit

2618
02:36:55.871 --> 02:36:58.160
different,
but you're like,
you know what I'm not doing,
I'll,

2619
02:36:58.190 --> 02:37:01.570
drinking is one where you wake up,
kind of hung over and you're like,

2620
02:37:01.571 --> 02:37:03.280
I'm not drinking anymore.
You,
I like that thing,

2621
02:37:03.281 --> 02:37:07.840
but you never really executed and it's perfect because it sticks with you.

2622
02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:10.470
You're like no more.
And then the other one was,
um,

2623
02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:15.090
when you're talking about every day,
it's called every day,
every day.

2624
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:18.500
Every day's a Monday.
That that,
that one was dope man.

2625
02:37:19.850 --> 02:37:20.780
So you can get after that.

2626
02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:25.100
Also if you want to get some tea,

2627
02:37:25.310 --> 02:37:27.260
if you're a tea drinker or if you're not a tea drinker,

2628
02:37:27.261 --> 02:37:30.530
you can get some Jocko white tea.
You can get it on Amazon.
It's fully in stock.

2629
02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:32.390
Yelled those days of being out of stock.

2630
02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.890
I think we've got them under control for now and I won't make any promises.

2631
02:37:36.891 --> 02:37:39.860
Cause last time I made a promise you guys went psycho.

2632
02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:42.710
So I'm not gonna make a promise,
but you can get the Jocko white tea.

2633
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:44.900
I figured out again it doesn't,

2634
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:49.970
it doesn't taste like tea really.
It doesn't taste like coffee.

2635
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:54.290
And for a long time I was at a loss for words to describe what it tasted like

2636
02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:55.700
and I figured it out.

2637
02:37:55.730 --> 02:37:59.240
I was responding to someone and I figured it out what it tastes like.

2638
02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:00.493
And it's pretty simple.

2639
02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:05.210
The Jocko white tea tastes like victory.

2640
02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:11.560
So if you need to,
we need to train.

2641
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:13.540
I need to trademark that one stat.

2642
02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:16.700
The fact then Jocko white tea tastes like victory.
Boom.

2643
02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:22.220
So get some of that if you need to.
Dead lift more.
If you need to.

2644
02:38:22.221 --> 02:38:24.290
Overhead squat more weight,

2645
02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:28.940
this will increase all those numbers beyond anything you could have hoped for.

2646
02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:33.710
You can drink it from a Jocko mug.
It says get after it on it.

2647
02:38:33.740 --> 02:38:38.030
That's good oversight by the way.
Yeah,
it's big.
It's big.
It's not somebody,

2648
02:38:38.031 --> 02:38:42.630
somebody made the comment that it's not comically big.
It's not a joke yet.

2649
02:38:42.980 --> 02:38:46.650
It's not like clown shoes
did it,

2650
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:50.480
but it's big enough to,
you know,
it's a bit like a pair of work boots.

2651
02:38:50.481 --> 02:38:55.010
As big as a pair of work boots,
it will kick you in the ass.
So it's that big.

2652
02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:59.510
If you haven't got the book,
extreme ownership,
you can pick that up there.

2653
02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:02.090
It's about leadership.
It's about combat leadership.

2654
02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:06.740
I'm going to give my friend Peter Attia about three copies of it just to make

2655
02:39:06.741 --> 02:39:09.500
sure he reads it.
So if he has to deal with any c players,

2656
02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:14.450
you going to step up his game.
A a free publication.
That's right.

2657
02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:18.040
That's really pre-public.
What does that mean?

2658
02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:22.600
Before the book came out,
Hey,
here's what the book is.
Okay,

2659
02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:27.590
but it's still,
that's it.
That's what you got there.
Pretty quick combat.
Yeah.

2660
02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:32.570
At the VIP kitty screening,
um,
Hey,

2661
02:39:32.571 --> 02:39:34.970
speaking of extreme ownership,
we're having another monster.

2662
02:39:35.390 --> 02:39:38.000
If you don't know what it is,
check out the website.

2663
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:43.150
Extreme ownership.com it's going to be in New York City so everyone can come.

2664
02:39:43.431 --> 02:39:46.040
Cause if you're on the east coast,
no matter where you are on the world,

2665
02:39:46.041 --> 02:39:48.440
it's easy to get to New York and

2666
02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:54.560
May 4th and fifth if you're a leader or you want to be a leader,

2667
02:39:54.650 --> 02:39:58.790
come and get it.
There's every level leaders,
their CEOs,

2668
02:39:59.090 --> 02:40:02.030
mid level managers,
every industry.

2669
02:40:02.031 --> 02:40:06.140
You can think of two people that are manufacturing and finance and construction

2670
02:40:06.141 --> 02:40:10.460
and health and pharmaceutical and there's police there and fire and military and

2671
02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:14.040
oil industry and entities to everybody all

2672
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:18.030
<v 5>working on leadership,
talking about leadership.
So,</v>

2673
02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:22.050
and I've said it's gonna sell out.
We're moving in that direction quickly.

2674
02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:25.720
And Echo hasn't even released his videos yet cause he's on Hawaiian time.
No,

2675
02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:30.570
no you're not.
No,
I'm working diligently and I'm going for quality.
Not,

2676
02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:33.540
you know,
you're not going to put out any scrub material.

2677
02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:36.900
Once those videos come out,
my feeling is going to sell it very quickly.

2678
02:40:36.930 --> 02:40:39.510
So get there now.
Sign up for it.

2679
02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:42.810
If you need a police or fire discount or military discount or if you're going to

2680
02:40:42.811 --> 02:40:43.860
bring a group of people.

2681
02:40:43.950 --> 02:40:47.520
I think the biggest group we had the last room for one company was around 16

2682
02:40:47.521 --> 02:40:49.710
people from one company or 12 people.

2683
02:40:49.711 --> 02:40:52.240
But there's some pretty big numbers of companies that are showing up there.

2684
02:40:53.010 --> 02:40:56.610
Come and come and get it.
Echo.
You've got any closing comments?

2685
02:40:59.470 --> 02:41:02.320
<v 4>My pleasure.
Oh no other clues and comments.
Thank you.</v>

2686
02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:05.980
Other than it was your pleasure.
Peter.
Any closing comments?

2687
02:41:06.310 --> 02:41:08.350
I would only echo echos,

2688
02:41:08.410 --> 02:41:13.210
comment and that didn't even get planned until it came out.

2689
02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:15.190
Perfect.
Perfect.

2690
02:41:15.980 --> 02:41:20.980
And if you want to continue these conversations with Peter on Twitter,

2691
02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:25.390
you're Peter Attia,
MD.
What are you on Facebook?

2692
02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:30.640
Um,
I don't know.
Probably.
Uh,

2693
02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:34.970
do you still have eating academy?
Is that the first left?
I don't,

2694
02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:35.830
I don't do a lot.

2695
02:41:35.890 --> 02:41:40.690
So Twitter's your most Twitter's private prominent and I've been berated into

2696
02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:45.400
doing something on Instagram.
I just can't cope at the moment.
The uh,

2697
02:41:45.970 --> 02:41:49.420
there's a way to connect the two.
I've tried it.
I don't like it.

2698
02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:53.500
I do them separately.
The Aa,
you don't really connect Twitter to the Instagram.

2699
02:41:53.501 --> 02:41:54.580
I think it's the other way around.

2700
02:41:54.610 --> 02:41:56.700
There's one way to connect to some of them somehow.
Yeah.

2701
02:41:56.980 --> 02:42:00.410
I just don't have enough pictures to show.
Right.
I don't have anything to,

2702
02:42:00.490 --> 02:42:02.680
don't you have a bunch of watches?
Yeah,

2703
02:42:02.681 --> 02:42:05.590
but I'm just going to watch the same watch every day.

2704
02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:11.040
I show that ring how you were explaining it could do like both pictures just on

2705
02:42:12.371 --> 02:42:13.570
the right for what if my,

2706
02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:18.720
what if my whole Instagram shtick became this like my blood glucose every

2707
02:42:19.330 --> 02:42:22.540
moment.
That'd be pretty cool.
And you kind of be interesting.
You could just,

2708
02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:26.830
you could just,
uh,
save that screen and posted up there.
So much work.

2709
02:42:27.450 --> 02:42:31.790
It's,
it's work.
It's hard labor to stave that thing and press submit to the,

2710
02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:34.000
it actually has a little switch that you can just make it go.

2711
02:42:34.570 --> 02:42:35.500
It's not that much work.

2712
02:42:36.010 --> 02:42:40.420
I'll think about it for somebody that swimming 18 miles and talk about too much

2713
02:42:40.421 --> 02:42:42.160
of work to post an Instagram picture.

2714
02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:47.360
<v 5>All right.
Echo and I,</v>

2715
02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:52.420
we are also present and accounted for on the interwebs on Twitter,

2716
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:58.420
on Instagram and also if you're going to be looking around that Facebook,

2717
02:42:58.421 --> 02:43:02.540
he how are we going to be their
echo?

2718
02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:06.500
Is that Echo Charles and I am at jockowillink and again,

2719
02:43:07.430 --> 02:43:11.830
how would like to thank you Peter for coming on and more for everything you've

2720
02:43:11.831 --> 02:43:12.100
done

2721
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:15.430
<v 0>for me,
which really the way it's connected all together,</v>

2722
02:43:15.431 --> 02:43:18.940
getting me through Kirk to Tim Ferriss,

2723
02:43:18.941 --> 02:43:23.530
which was the book and get me on Joe Rogan,
which led to this podcast.

2724
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:25.720
It's been awesome.

2725
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:30.750
So to you and to to doc Kirk Parsley for an introducing us,

2726
02:43:31.210 --> 02:43:33.910
but thank you and him for what you guys done for me.

2727
02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:38.230
So men and women in uniform out there holding the line.

2728
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:45.150
Thanks for your service and your sacrifice to the police on the corner.

2729
02:43:47.650 --> 02:43:50.290
Fighting crime,
the firemen fighting fires.

2730
02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:55.560
Thanks for keeping us safe to the medical people in the medical professions,

2731
02:43:56.890 --> 02:43:59.980
like Peter,
doctors,
nurses,

2732
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:01.930
physician's assistants,

2733
02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:05.890
he empties all of you working to save lives.

2734
02:44:05.950 --> 02:44:09.100
Thank you for your commitment to service,

2735
02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:14.160
and it's obviously a massive commitment when you hear about the hours and the

2736
02:44:15.011 --> 02:44:20.011
emotional trauma that it takes to go into any one of those industries and

2737
02:44:21.401 --> 02:44:25.690
services and to everybody else that's listening.

2738
02:44:27.010 --> 02:44:31.120
Thank you.
It's your communications,

2739
02:44:31.150 --> 02:44:36.010
your questions,
your participation,
your feedback,

2740
02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:39.880
and your spreading of the word that makes this possible.

2741
02:44:39.881 --> 02:44:42.640
And it's what makes this worthwhile.

2742
02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:48.460
So thank all of you for all of that.

2743
02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:54.490
Then finally,
thanks to all of you for getting out there

2744
02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:57.310
and getting after it.

2745
02:44:57.360 --> 02:44:58.193
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2746
02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:02.690
<v 0>so until next time,
this is Dr Peter Attia,</v>

2747
02:45:04.110 --> 02:45:08.340
